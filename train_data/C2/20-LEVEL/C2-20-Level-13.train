That is it and I hate it when you keep on and on nagging.

my dad's speed.
your dad's speed.
Not mine.
You don't drive?

What is it?
London University.
"In Cambridge got something to do with, what was that he said?"
Well anyway something about University  you know all these  studies they do.
Yeah.
It's all about speech patterns.
Geoff and Joan  thought erm  someone was trying to  rob us along here!
He sat  in his car out there
Poor little man!
and they thought that he was the accomplice  sitting outside while somebody was going round the house.
"I said I don't know what hollering for, he's got a bloody"
I'm surprised they haven't got
rottweiller there!
the bloody postman down as a
Oh yeah.
detective or something!
But how pathetic!
"I, put me in a detention centre because I was shoplifting  and I didn't like it there so I left!"
Tt tt tt tt tt tt tt tt!
What is your name?
Sarah.

And where do you normally live?
Where are you homeless now?
"I'm, in Manchester at the moment."
I knew you were gonna say Manchester!
How old are?
Have you cut holes in your trousers to put
sixteen.
big triangles of cloth in and turn them into flares  then ?
No!
Not quite!
Do you go begging?
"Well  sometimes, but sometimes I just pickpocket  it's much easier that way."
Have you turned to prostitution as a way of getting money?
"No, I don't think that's a really good idea, it's not safe."
It's not   .
Do you sleep in shop doorways or do you go to a hostel so sometimes?
"Well, I haven't got much money but  well sometimes I do go to hostels, yeah  but, most of the time I just sleep anywhere I can find a shelter."
Bus shelters are quite helpful.
Have you ever thought about going back home?
I was gonna say that!
No.
I don't i if  it would be no point.
But why?
Yes we'd have to check.
erm I should first check.
"Check with them, yeah quite."
"So I I do, you do Tesco."
I'll do the swimming pool.
"I, I, I  would check who actually  is responsible for that"
.
But of course all paper now is
All paper?
All paper.
What about this  chap then?
It's in the library th with his number.
"Well, you ring him but if he, if he gets upset or, or"
Oh I see.
it's it's strange  you can give that as an address.
Any Uttlesford  town of some size has got a comprehensive recycling centre now that takes any paper
Do you have to sort it?
Do you have to take it sorted?
No.
No.
It's just a big skip?
And it says
at Stanstead
Do they then sort it?
the car park
"No, they it's  the council collects it and  in Uttlesford, that's why I said we should get at the same time  an Uttlesford councillor because I would"
"Yes, yeah"
"like to know a, whether their new scheme is only temporary, is about to break down."
Mm.
Or whether they actually get the disposals cost incorporated into this skip collecting cost.
Because the  money they can get for this  mixed paper must be a pittance.
Mm.
Friday the thirteenth.
What a day to buy a motorbike.
"See the value of the bike came down, the value of the insurance came down cos I put the value at twelve hundred pounds."
See erm there was a ten percent discount if you had it erm  under twelve hundred and fifty pounds.
Yeah.
So in some ways it's cheaper insurance but in others  it's erm  a bit of a sting.
Have you done?
Come on.
Oy.
See that machine there?
What does it do?
It hides behind mother so that Brian can't get at it.
No.
This plates go in this way.
Well I'm not allowed to use this machine so er
Knives and forks should go in  that way.
Right?
Why that way?
There are glass plates   somewhere.
Have you made any tea Mary?
No.
No.
Do you want some tea?
I want to get into the habit of finishing  and getting the dishwasher on and ge cleaning the kitchen completely.
I told him to ring  I told him ring Apex up in case they were recruiting.
Because there are jobs up on the notice board.
But he said Apex  didn't know anything about it at the moment.
"So I mean, if Apex don't know anything about it I don't know why they don't ."
Now you know I don't get on with plastic.
Oh I got it first time.
I got it first time.
Oh god.
no no no but I'm pa if
So go on yo
I were in power there wouldn't be any money  no need for it!
Then you
Well I
wouldn't have all
I
the arguments!
I know that!
So you wouldn't
Yeah.
say that at all!
No.
Yeah.
And what would you do
But in the case of these people that  start off
So why why should
"Fair do's they start off in University, clever blokes  and a lot of them worked in the mines, Shinwells  what's his name?"
Beven  miners
Just for money!
Well I won't say  Beven  because it's a bloody shame what happened to him!
But never the less  a lot of them started off like that didn't they?
Another one is Foot.
Ah but er he
"And  as they get into, as you say, power and I quite agree  somebody has a talk with them so look here"
We know
we know you're a socialist
But you still earned a few bob to get on.
"But er, you you we're gonna make you a nice one and join the bloody club  so you'll be  an armchair socialist  and we look after you  and that's what they are!"
Callaghan is another example  two or three homes  big Jim with all his bloody money what does he care about working people?
"And this feller Kinnock's the same, you can see the style of them!"
I think he must be
"Funny way of writing it, but you ca you could write it that way."
Ten X.
Erm  people might say oh well we'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Yeah.
And you'd get some sort of shape.
But you'd miss a lot of important points.
Yeah.
Erm if they took it from minus ten to plus ten
Yeah.
you'd see a lot more things of interest and maybe  say oh I'll take it from minus fifteen to plus fifteen.
"But you're still missing out a big, very important part of the graph, because for a lot of its range it actually, you know, looks something like well what would that look like?"
When X is gigantic.
Ten times.
"If, if X was a million say, you could forget about a million minus ten, let's just call it a million,"
times ten
Ten.
"minus a million, we'll forget about the ten, just think of the minus a million."
So it's a million times minus a million.
Roughly.
A million times minus a million?
Ah.
Minus.
"What's, okay, let's come down a bit."
What's plus three times minus three?
Three.
What's plus three times plus three?
Nine.
Right.
"And, minus three times minus three?"
Minus nine.
No.
Minus three times minus three?
Well I firmly believe in building up a library .
So do I.
Good I'm glad
I I mean there's
you said that because I w I want to buy a book!
no  library because I think  er if you are contacted for information and you are able to say  okay we have a book  or we have books.
Yeah.
"That's that's one of the things I I I ke , I've kept all my New Scientists."
I keep these.
Yeah.
I go through them gonna collate that cos there's loads of stuff in there good.
Yeah.
But I do get quite a few people phone me as you know asking for information.
I just photocopy relevant bits
None of  none of them has got in contact with me.
Really!
No.
Aren't they funny.
I get the feeling
Well I should give you er
that they either phone in.
Phone me and then get it all given to them  just like that.
That yeah.
And no further effort involved cos
"Well I should, I could ."
No it isn't.
"This woman who, who keeps phoning me up about all this oil pollution on her land."
She she.
"I sent, I wrote off to Friends of the Earth, I got a load of information all about the law  and she still phones me up and say oh you know what the District Council's they won't do anything and the N R A wasn't doing anything."
And I said well when did you last contact them?
February!
Apparently she's got a problem that  the oil pollution is coming off this site where they're refurbishing the boilers.
It hasn't actually happened.
Yes.
"You're, you're implementing a procedure here that doesn't exist, is what Jim's saying."
You're implementing a procedure
Within B E S.
which says you're gonna do this
Right?
Sorry.
Sorry.
No.
It doesn't say that.
This procedure should say you do this.
That's what we're doing at the moment.
Right.
he's quite right in saying
book is an instruction.
Yeah.
And Jim's
"quite right in saying, it does not happen."
But it's not the first time that a procedure's
Finished.
come out early.
So you've implemented a procedure for wh which you haven't set up you haven't even looked at the resource information
but can be briefed
We are introducing a procedure.
Yes.
And in order to c come in and say
like that?
No.
why don't you do this?
"And I could say well I, I've never done this."
"I can't do this, and Q S is not geared up to do it."
Mm.
And it was either thinking about the wage packet at end of week which I was at first.
Mm.
"And then  I were coming home and I were, I were really awful."
And I thought why should I?
And then on Thursday  I went in to work and I had had enough.
"And I come home and I says to him, I'm not having this no more."
"I said no,."
Mm.
He says well if you want to pack it in love
Bless you.
pack in.
"And I did and to be quite honest, I mean  it wasn't the money really when you think about it because at end of day, forty six pound  he were spending in pub anyway."
So  I were working for nothing really.
Yeah.
but he he were getting cos you were going out and having a drink er on er Tuesdays Thursdays Saturdays and Sundays.
"Whereas now, I mean  we don't go."
You don't go.
No.
"And well I, we even considered me and my sister even considered going back into driving instruction."
We went to a seminar
Mm.
a fortnight ago.
"It's stupid, I mean I've been a driving instructor seventeen year, and I'm not allowed to teach over here."
No?
"No, I've got to take it all again."
"You're talking about sixteen, seventeen hundred pound to get you through."
Yeah.
"But you see with this bank thing with the government, you can have a loan  I think it's up to about four thousand pound  like a restart."
And it's a free loan for fifteen months.
Mm.
And then on the sixteenth month you've gotta pay it back.
Well he's obviously hungry if he wants say have a second Bonio  so I just give it to him  so what   oh excuse me will look good with my full colour and commendations and credits and
"Which means we've done three times in a night and a half, Agnes?"
"Oh, she's useless!"
So you're gonna write up the list?
"Yeah, may as well."
But  today  when we finished up to the middle of th here.
But erm  so as what we have to do is to basically  arrange  start arranging things.
Like songs.
What do you reckon I should get?
Sort of trout  trout hors d'oeuvres and stuff?
Oh my God!
I can't stand fish!
"No, do smoked salmon."
Or smoked salmon hors d'oeuvres.
"You know, bits of smoked salmon on cheese sticks and things."
Ya.
Poke people's eyes  with a
"Cos you don't want wanna have a meal, sort of nicknacky that you can sort of nibble."
Like Donna!
Sausage rolls and stuff like that  sort of thing.
Yeah.
"I don't suppose you fancy taking this tape machine home tonight do you, and recording some of your conversation with your brother or something?"
"The longest conversation we have is, get off the computer, it's my turn!"
"Er, I wonder if we should take this to school tomorrow?"
Oh great laugh!
"Yeah, I tell you what you could take this to school for me."
Why?
"And you could tape it, er imagine it's yours"
Yeah.
"well, then you won't get the comments will you  that I get?"
Yeah.
What do you think?
But there is something about you that is a bit different to  politicians.
Apart from that but Well th that's true that's true .
Trouble.
Trouble.
And you've had plenty of that.
Plenty of trouble.
And yet you keep bouncing back or
Yes.
swinging back.
"I mean, er"
"I wrote a book called, Where there's a will."
Precisely.
You resigned over over Westland you er er you were defeated for the leadership.
"You've had your heart attack, you've been out of action for three months and yet, when you talk to people, when the pollsters go out with their clipboards, they say, Who do you think is most likely apart from the Prime Minister, to lead the Tory party?"
"And they say, you."
Still.
So what is it about you?
Trouble.
It's got to be a bit more than that.
Ambition ?
Long hair.
"Long hair, tall."
You know.
Been around a long time.
"Erm I  what is it, who knows, who cares?"
"You know, if I'm president of the board of trade, I'm a loyal member of John Major's cabinet."
I intend to go on doing that as long as he wants me.
And the inevitable qu you'd expect me to ask this to you.
"If John Major fell under a privatized train, would your hat still be in the ring?"
Or
Well
"would you say, I've had it all now, I do"
I thought it was you?
No.
No.
"He and, erm a the other bloke are still there."
"The chap who tried to call, the one watching it?"
"Behind, yep."
"Yeah, he's still there."
I was gonna say er  somebody told me that he'd left and I thought it was you cos nobody would .
"No, he's still here."
"I got it wrong, yeah."
"Yeah, could have been me Marg."
Could have easily been me.
Do you think you'd better aim for the winter now?
"I would, definitely."

"Di , no,th October."
police took him in that night cos they thought he'd burnt it out himself.
"And it's taken all this time, it's gone to court and all the rest of it, and they haven't got a case."
"So, they couldn't do anything in the meantime."
I should think
Well they
that was genuine.
the banks wo wouldn't let me have extra money or anything like that.
Oh!
They're trying to get somewhere now  with the police but  it could have happened anywhere!

No.
"I think you've got some, some attitude problems!"
"They don't care about me , so why should I care about them!"
"Yes, I think you've got a serious attitude problem!"
Oh they call it

"No I didn't, no"
"cos I say cos erm Bill never got a bag, and it four pounds something now"
Where'd he get it from?
"Oh I don't know, but it was"

Oh yeah
They got there but they had to go in second gear look
"Oh dear, oh I wonder how they'd got down there, I wonder whether they sort of"
No they got down

"Yeah they went down in convoy car and I think they, four or five cars went down there"
Oh yeah
"there were sixteen of them, sixteen of them all there"
Sixteen?
"Yeah sixteen of them, well the more of them you see the cheaper it is"
Yeah  she said that er they walked into Minehead on Sunday
This.
I mean I have been into this  window frame business.
Mm
Because we have to have sash and  sash  soft wood.
So anyway  various companies wrote.
Well they do use tropical rainforest wood but
Yeah.
it's government  er schemes.
Yeah it's like some sort of erm okay.
Yeah.
"And I mean I have, I I remember that on some T V programmes they they said it's all  bogus"
Mm.
I mean that it is not really government run er .
They reforest it but what they reforest is eucalyptus or
Yeah palm erm they  oil palm plantations
Mm.
Mm.
They just er .
"Actually I've got a, I've got a brilliant picture that I took outside the train."
Erm we were travelling through Malaysia and erm  it's just one canopy tree standing on its own  in the middle of nowhere.
And there's all this sort of undergrowth.
"And it's obviously that one wasn't, just didn't want it or it was dead or something and they just left it."
Mhm.
And it's just the one.
"And then  I've got all the pictures of all the logs on the  train wagons and er that was really  it was a, it was a good picture actually cos I thought oh look at that poor old tree there it's"
Yeah.
all its friends and then it was just standing there on the ground.
But really it's completely  it's completely wiped out Malaysia the whole of central Malaysia is just  just gone.
And all the soil's eroding cos it's sort of  sand and it's red.
And it goes into dust.
So it goes everywhere so I mean there's gonna be trouble with that in the future .
It's where they get all the flooding isn't it?
Yeah.
The first book on the left there Dave by the big fat volume that's called
"To, to the left of your, your omnibus."
That's it.
Ta.
Where?
Wha what do we want a project engineer to do?
I want him to do an M S two or three .
What do we want him to do?
Come on.
.
Manage that project.
Through from conception to completion.
Un unfortunately it raises the question of the project coordinator whose role
Mm.
Mm.
talk to you about you know ne next week
Mm.
because it's all rolled into the same thing.
Right.
I say it's
Shall we leave it till then?
responsibility.
Right.
"Let, let us leave it till then because I mean otherwise we're gonna get bogged down in this and whe when we really are briefing procedures."
Yeah.
But you've raised a very valid point and it's one that we need to see through to the end.
I can s I can see
The role o of
I can see what you're driving at.
the role of a project engineer is defined in Q S P six.
Which Roger hasn't seen yet
It was totally wild
That pool that pool would be really good if it wasn't for the water.
Why what's wrong with the water?
It's shitty.
Ah it's fucking chlorinated to fuck.
Is it?
there'll be dickheads and
I know it's right  but that's a laugh I think.
You just  you just watch them and all and you just
"I thought they were in every pool like, you can m even do it yourself without thinking about it  if you want  some people"
I don't start thinking about it cos I fart under the water
"Well I'd, I,buy your poster"
I   I'm going down south next week and I intend
"Oh Paul we don't wanna hear your problems, buy the poster."
Credit?
"You'll be off work, I'll be off work"
when you get your test.
Aye of course if I get the  test .
"Don't, don't be going fuck mad and taking"
Ah I've no intention of going fuck mad.
You know what happened on Sunday?
"cos there is so many people  get their licence, bang they're out the door, in the car"
Bang
"bash it five minutes down the road, bang  bang"
"on Sunday, Sunday morning I was up"
Was it that guy that crashed before?
Yeah.
"It wasn't his fault this time, I mean, I'm serious, it was, it was not his fault"
I can't believe this .
Ah yeah
Alright.
He's staying at my house.
"Anyway he's just rotting his bowel, he'll be rotting his liver next!"
"Yeah  I said to him   Cliff, I think it's tragic mate!"
"I said that's none of my business, nothing to do with me  but I said I should think it's a tragic waste for you  and I say, it wastes your money  but that's  entirely down to you."
And what did he say?
Nothing.
"He didn't say a word, no."
Well it is a shame innit?
"Mm  I mean, you know when he gave up the drink"
He was a different man.
"he was a different bloke, yeah."
Mm.
"And the trouble is you see  they all make laugh of it  old Cliff, old Cliff, old Cliff!"
"And that makes him worse, really."
"Yeah well I said to him, what you don't realise is Cliff  they laugh at you  to your face"
But they talk
at the
behind your back!
end of the day when you do something wrong they're the first to nip in that office and say what you've done wrong  and why you've done it wrong.
"Yeah,."
But I think I shall have a quiet word with him tomorrow morning when I get to work.
Gonna see him?
Yeah.
And say what?
"Well, you know  I just can't sort of let it go on."
Well he perhaps won't do it any more now you've told him.
"As soon he gets his mouth round a Guinness bottle mate, that's it!."
"Well for heaven's sake, how many does he have?"
"Well it's roughly about five pound and, one pound and  I thought he said one pound forty a pint."
How many bottles does he have?
Well he got through fifty quid on Saturday and Sunday  so that's forty pints innit?
That's twenty pints each day
What and  forty pints in a night !
So I would think that we're working on a five minute schedule .
"Don't forget that when they first did this, people would not have had personal watches."
And there may only have been one clock in the town where they worked and that would have been on the  town hall or the church.
Clocks are a very  recent er  introduction as far as ordinary er working conditions are concerned.
What might have they have had to measure the time as it passed?
Egg timer.
Sundial.
"Sundial, yes."
But that might not have been too convenient.
Egg timer.
Say it was night for instance.
Pardon?
One of them sand things.
One of them sand things.
Who knows what they're called?
Egg timer.
An egg timer is what we use them for now.
Do you know what the traditional name for them is?
Anybody know?
It's called an hourglass.
Have you heard that before?
No.
Sir.
You scratched your nose and you've got acid on them gloves.
Right.
I did didn't I?
Yeah.
But I  I should come out in great welts soon and start looking like an American werewolf in London.
"Right, my face will start falling off."
Quite right.
You must be careful not to unconsciously  touch anything with  even the gloves.
And you should wash the gloves  as soon as you've touched the acid.
I shall mar all of that he has made and foraged.
This way!
This way!
Why?
Who am I then my love?
Who am I?
"I'll tell you, since you know about yourself."
Did you know ?
Yes she belongs to time not long past.
The good honest  that kept your master's worship house when he requires .
Will you please go out?
Since  translated so that I'll be the Captain.
By your needs such as those .
With the amount of my money all this must  .
.
"Okay, we'll sto stop there."
Now  even in that had a fairly dry reading through.
"Are there any things you want to add to that list, just looking at that?"
"Di different language and er, and what's going on."
Yeah.
In  I think  the people were speaking faster.
Alright.
"You, looking through it and almost laughing at the ."
Right.
"I think that  almost , we've got another  aspect of  erm   comedy, comedy  it's really on the basis of arguments, fighting  complication between people."
"Which, as you quite rightly say  you really need to hear, hear the voices going on."
and I'll get some people
"along the middle in a moment and, and do it."
"Any, any other things?"
Did anybody snigger on anything
No.
in those thirty lines?
Have a chart.
Heart.
You'll let people  overlook each other then  sort of overlooking
Cheating you mean!
"Yes I mean that's the first thing you have to say, you have to think  when you look at   you keep, anybody who does the whispering"
Is Mum.
"is giving their answers away  in fact, what we did, the team of four, is they all had a little pad of paper, if you spotted something you knew, you went  and you wrote it down  because people we there."
You did it in silence.
Yeah  tried to do  and they obviously can't.
Why aren't you gonna  for faces.
Well this th this is the the faces and I thought I'd do the maps and the rest were questions I don't know whether y should do some questions.
Well you'll have to think of some.
Yeah  I'll see how I go any
You got the maps of South America?
Yeah.
"I've got one at work  a blank, you should of asked me for it."
"What all split up, yeah?"
Yeah.
Oh.
I could get it tomorrow morning  in my
Yeah could you?
Blanked out without the er the countries names
Yes
in it?
Oh yeah.
"I've got all the countries blanks  might not oh I might not even have the countries on but if you had blanks you could put countries in, that'll be easier than"
No that'll be harder.
No  what the boundaries?
"Yes  because if you've got the scale  you just drop, trace it all off  where as you got the you've the you gotta sort out work out  i th the scale of everything, haven't you?"
No you just draw the lines.
Yeah but how do you ge
What scale?
They let British come into America
"Yeah, it's the accommodations."
Yeah.
Come on girl.
Not the other way round of course.
"No, no."
Dogs from Britain can practically live anywhere
Yeah.
"Hel hello Topsy, hello Topsy, I'll shall squeeze your feet if you do it any more, I'll shall squeeze your paws and you won't like it."
Is that a good way of stopping her doing it?
"Mm, I always use to do it with my German Shepherd."
"Yeah, but they don't ."
"Cos, cos they're big enough, if they even in love, they can knock a child, well they could knock a grown up flat on your back."
She'll not be too .
"Yes, no squeeze the paws ,"
"We got  ,"
"not, not too hard for her but enough so that it's uncomfortable"
yeah.
"and they hate it, and after, after a week, after a week of having their paws squeezed every time they jump up,stop ."
"I've a lot, a lot of my friends have got  big dogs and they say oh they will jump up and I say squeeze her paws, it usually works"
Mm.
"in a week, ten days, something like."
I'll have to do that.
"They're a very , but they can still knock you flat on your back."
"Oh yeah, well she's had a, a some old chap who was walking around here, she just ran past him"
Yeah.
and she just caught the back of his leg  .
"Oh yeah , behind your knees you can."
He just crumpled up.
"I say she's only doing, she's only playing around."
"Oh yes, it's all affection."
"Mm, I'll have to try that with the feet, come on."
"So with that  call it coincidence, call it what you like  but one of these low-loaders come in  to pick up a caravan or something like."
"And I said there you are, he's there waiting to pick my caravan up."
He was empty you see.
I don't know who he was.
And she said wait here Mr  and in she goes in to this bloody meeting  and out he came.
And he said I'm sorry Mr  but you haven't got an appointment.
"I said do you want me to have an appointment, do you want to listen to this tape?"
Or do you want me to take my caravan off here?
He said why?
I said because I feel I'm being .
I said I'm not getting a fair square deal here.
"I said and not only I think that, other people on the site think so."
He asked me if I could wait five minutes.
when I'm in there.
And Darren was on a day off and he's been .
And Darren come in  spoke to me and he says  oh I  Danny.
I said no you bloody won't.
You'll get in that office with me.
I said I want him in there.
He sold me the caravan.
And I went in there.
I says now  have you had any visitors from   a couple of nights in my caravan.
No he said.
I said I think somebody's saying some untruth to me.
I said because I've got a tape here  and there's a couple  who'll go to court if necessary.
And I said is my caravan being cleaned weekly  as people go out if they've got it for a fortnight fortnightly.
Yes he said.
I said well you play that  I said cos I've played it back.
"And out he goes and gets this woman and in she comes with a chart  with a woman's name  the job number, that done it week by week or fortnight, whatever it does."
And that is all there and signed that she done the caravan.
It's her signature.
Her signature.
Oh they go  if he starts singing!
Why!
Cos  singing?
"So he dropped a metal pallet on  purpose  and course, it makes a hell of a row!"
"Yeah  well I would of thought it'd been nice, been nice to have"
Well
somebody happy around instead of miserable.
"Yeah but he, he is rather loud."
Is he always singing?
Oh terrible!
I wouldn't mention it.
I suppose he does it on purpose don't he?
Yeah.
Never mind singing.
"I ha I had sort of few, few words with him this morning."
With who?
"Cliff, Cliff ."
Why?
Cos of that   come in front again.
we do.
I never said nothing mm  cos
Why aren't you drinking that?
Yeah when I've had this.
"I never said anything  then he er  I could see he'd gone cos he just stood there  for about ten minutes like th and everybody else was working, he just stood there like this for about ten minutes by the rack  see him doing nothing  I never said nothing  he come charging through with a rack  and knocked all the pallet over what they just stacked up  with fifty boxes on  so we had to  make that right  and he stacked a load of L T M boxes which are temperamental anyway  and he hadn't pulled the wrap tight so as soon the bloke lift them up with the forklift, they fell all over!"
They fell over.
Ooh Christ!
"And then I'd  I'd had enough  and then he started messing about and he started pushing the boxes down through my strapper  then, course that messed the strapper up!"
So I
Did it?
I was doing the lift.
Oh!
He said what's the matter?
Yes.
And then we paid for a winter clean.
And it's filthy!
Mm.
I had to go down there twice
To get it done!
Okay?
Because the windows were filthy!
"Twice, that we argued  ."
"Well, well  you came here didn't you when the curtains hadn't been"
Jump down then Phillip!
"And when I spoke to Mr , I said well  if I was renting a caravan and went to see it and it was dirty like that, I wouldn't want to take it on!"
"And, I said surely you have somebody who goes round and checks them before they're let?"
"No, he said!"
"So what they do is, apparently they wait for somebody to complain"
Yeah.
and then they look at the caravan!
Do they?
That's somebody who comes up to rent it!
So I said and in that case then  probably  you move them into another caravan?
"Oh no, we clean it and  they go into it!"
"I said, you mean to say people wait around while you clean the caravan?"
I don't believe it!
"You're alright , you're alright for your holiday, find a caravan dirty, you've gotta complain before it gets cleaned!"
Ha!
People will !
They can complain to the Tourist Board.
to be done when he was he.
Should be bloody licensed!
You can did you say?
You can.
You can't!
"So do you want the yoghurt, yoghurt before we go to the  ?"
"I don't think it matters, but  if the weather's still going to be freezing at night"
"And if so does, does"
I've got the
"the,it's outside all the time anyway ."
"I know, but it's got the polythene bag round it still."
I got it standing on that brick  so it would drain.
I wish I knew what to do with the other azalea.
"Some of the  erm  stems on it look as if the  not mouldy but they're, they're sort of"
Well we'll just have to dig it up and put
green.
another one in.
Those hyacinths in the cauldron are taking a long time to come out aren't they?
I know.
"I would have thought the tulip  that went in the er coal scuttle  the tulips in the cauldron  I thought they'd had it, they were lying down completely."
I know.
They just straightened
They were
up.
just  grown up again.
"And those  forget-me-nots  that are called blue ball and are supposed to have brilliant blue flowers, they're coming out with erm  tiny  pinkey, purpley flowers."
I know.
"If they're blue, so am I!"
"And then we've got miniature roses gonna come up, one that's on it own, that one with the"
The wha
on the tub.
Is there one in the tub?
No.
Yes.
"Oh ye the one in the tub looks okay, it's the other one."
Mhm.
"I like the other best as well, it's the peach one."
They're cutting back on education.
"Oh, you're telling me"
They're making it so only the rich can be educated.
"Yeah, trying to turn it back into"
at the end of the day.
"I mean, our Colin's there waiting for a grant and what's happening."
Sweet nothing.
"Now we're, it were in bloody paper last  on Thursday, they don't get nothing when they're on holiday."
"No, they don't,"
"I mean, how the hell they supposed at eighteen year old without a job."
Mm.
"If they have a job, they don't get no grants."
"And how can you have, hold a  a job down"
I don't think
And do education at same time.
"I'm not sure, but  I think I don't got my family allowance until I were eighteen, I think, I think they used to give us"
let me keep our Karen's
Oh.
"So I've got a form to fill in, actually."
"It should have gone back last week, and I"
It'll all stop when she gets her grant through.
Don't knock me.
She said not necessarily.
"I think it will stop them  thought shit I'm not bloody going to declare it,"
Yeah.
"She applied for a grant, and in, er in career, it says like,"
Sasha
"you'll, like you you"
"No, you'll rip it."
"Left home, you know, we are, like, say our Karen to leave home."
Aye.
Yeah.
Yes.
activates the lights as it's approaching the crossing.
"Yes cos most,o most of that one barrier, it said on the news that they're o automatic."
That's right.
So
They have er special cameras which  they take the line of the trains both sides.
Mhm.
"And the barriers drop, so if you try and go through when the lights are flashing or if you try and go round the barriers  the chances are the train's getting nearer and nearer and could hit you."
So it's a very silly thing to do.
Yes.
Like if it's one metre away and there's a car going across.
Well if you were that close and the lights started you'd probably get across.
"But if you, like, you know what it's like when we come"
"If, if the barriers were down er and you were still on the railway  er th ah  there's only way you can escape."
Go round by the barrier pole.
"Well yes, but look at the crossings we've got in Driffield."
Yes.
The barriers
Er
.
they've got full barriers you see.
Full barriers.
Double are safe.
"Well, they're different because they have them  they're really controlled by a man in a signal box so they're"
Yes they are controlled.
controlled by a television.
Er
"If they're controlled  well dad, everyone knows that one th the Tackleby's controlled by a man."
Oh yes.
That was good wasn't it?
Yes.
"Yes, you enjoyed that trip into the signal box didn't you?"
lot's of
make the tenth !
Well I I I could but all
we'll go through go through some papers and start cutting out things
and I  a chair for the
only thing if I if you do it
even in the chair for a meeting
you won't enter the quiz  so what do you wanna do?
about erm
Would you rather me do it on my own
I think
And then you can enter with  cos I thought about sticking everybody into pairs
cos they've asked me.
Mean I won't be able to enter
the quiz?
Well you'll know the answers won't you!
Oh I want that some  if all the social services just put in with the  thing having
Please can I a ask the questions?
a series of six meetings  about this
Now let's have everything tha I want to aim a at doing any oral questions just
Ah?
like
"a lot about it and shan't be, frankly I'm relieved I don't actually know a lot but  when the meeting to discuss what we're supposed to do is on December tenth  yo so I'm a bit torn cos I  in a way that's what I ought to be doing even though the welfare business  in a way that's wh that's what I ought to be doing cos it's  entirely ."
Would you like Paul to buy presents  tomorrow?
For me at the fair?
Oh  well he says he's got e he's got enough now hasn't he?
No you want one!
To give to me on Sunday.
Oh I see.
Still put that aside .
Oh Trevor was quite good he di he d he would've got his big pay rise today an didn't  push it too much I don't think  perhaps it's Nick though
Why's got a big one?
Mm.
Mm.
"Also, we are a much more tolerant society, generally."
Yeah.
"Yeah, yeah."
"We can encompass people who are a bit different nowadays, which they couldn't."
Yeah.
Couldn't in those days.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
"I think they use the phrase now, do their own thing."
"That  yeah, yeah, yeah"
Mm.
Mm.
Mm.
"Yes, yeah."
"So we now have erm, reference to the bible and the erm, prodigal son."
"The prodigal son was a black sheep to his father, and to his older brother."
But how different were the reactions of the two.
"His adventure started off quite normally, as I'm sure you'll remember from the erm, from the parable."
"Every child must break away from the parental fold, and establish his own personal identity."
Things began to go wrong when he got into bad company.
He had then asked for his share of his inheritance.
"He wanted it then and there, not later."
"With money in his possession, was he a pray to the unscrupulous."
I'm sure he was.
He had journeyed into a far country.
That showed initiative.
But did it cut him off from the guidance he needed?
"The story relates, that he spent all."
"He was not prudent enough to have saved, so he began to be in want."
"you see and they're asking for people who could ref who could, you know, give references to cos like  put all these, all, down on these different things that you want like  you know, say you want  but then a lot of people just put down small business and management, something like that."
You'll end up with some real wanker like.
"Ah no then, no."
I don't mind if it's yous guys.
"Oh it wouldn't be me cos I'm, I'm doing it this year and I only thought of it too late"
Yeah.
"and I'd already put my other form in like to er I, and I was raging cos like I could've got  and sat in here for a fucking week"
Well you still can if  you want like .
"No I have to go and, have to go to this"
"No some other people were saying about that, you know, ah that they, you know  that they were gonna put in for it but they wouldn't let them cos it was  shop, you know, blah blah blah."
But I mean  yes certainly if it was y if it was you coming down but I don't want
It won't be me.
plonker that I don't know.
It wouldn't be me.
"No, no, that's alright"
You've not talked to me all day and then it's that sort of thing.
"Well I could probably get somebody who would be into comics like  and then that would maybe start you talking and then like, but he could still be an old wanker sure"
As long as
What's this?
Who's this?
I don't know who it is.
Someone called  Raoul
You mean Raoul as in
Raoul?
Friend of Johnny's?
Yeah.
"No, don't think so."
Is Raoul English or something?
"Er  no I just think his dad is  and they've just picked it up from their dad, you know."
It's not the   Rhythm guitarist the bass player  oh my goodness .
Oh they've got a drummer as well
a vocalist as well.
"They ain't got  a mask or anything like Tutenkhamen has, have they?"
No  there was only one real mask.
Oh well that's   I've seen  Jimmy.
When do you see him?
In the .
What?
half past eleven  just now  literally just now  and er  and he  basically he don't know about  what he's on about.
Oh no!
"Nope, he don't know  erm  what he's saying is"
A lovely little man weren't he?
that blokes that's erm  dro been rigging it  who he does the things for.
Why?
"Well, because he said  for obvious reasons, he said er  I didn't want  my name and address  mentioned."
isn't mentioned in the papers.
Now he's gonna wish we'd tell him  so he said erm
Well what has he done with it then?
"Oh it was genuinely gone  quite genuine, he said  you now, he had a , that we know about  but it had  genuine"
"Cor , it didn't do that!"
Well there are you  don't go near them.
Well we'll have to get our own then won't we?
So he said   choice  because it was his  property they contacted him  but he said what he's done is though right  there isn't anywhere near that amount!
He said we're talking about eighty or ninety
We're short on twenty two.
"We could  we can, ah no  no  in terms of money  he's talking about four or five thousand maximum."
Well
Where did you  get the twenty two from then?
Cos he told me there's three hundred gone.
Well Jimmy ought to tell her
"Well  you know what he's trying to do, he's trying up the claim  so when  back, he's still gonna get the amount that he wants  so he said t to  Jim  something about, he isn't paying the insurance  I said you're joking!"
He said I've insured it he said but I ain't paying  as well he said!
"If you're getting all the money he said, you can pay the premium!"
So erm  they're sort of having a few words at the moment.
Right I I that's fine yes I'll

This issue

Yeah.
having them at home  I mean  erm

Pretty good!
So all that row then was for absolutely nothing at all wasn't it really?
Eh?
All that
And I used my old pass to go on stage anyhow so
Have you got to pass for the stage then?
Yeah.
I used an
What
old one.
"So  those but Fantasia passes are very similar, I just turned mine  turned mine round she saw it and went  she showed me a blank yellow so I didn't  thought it perhaps a different pass but it wasn't  just turned it round on her."
"I bet your  friends a will be  sick then, won't they?"
"I just think that when you're up there it's like the stage is a huge platform going out into the crowd, a long one!"
And there must have been about ten thousand there last time.
They had one of those gyroscopes you can go in  and you can spin round.
Oh yeah!
"They had one of those in there  but I didn't have a go on it though, it was about three quid to go on!"
Those lasers  lasers that   the .

Erm
I could keep one in the green Eurobonds advert.
Yep
Yeah.

Fine idea.

Okay.
"Don't know what, don't know what they'll make of all that gobbledegook.   bye bye love."
Have a good weekend.
See you soon .
See you next week.
"This is the wrong side, they must have rewound it without meaning to."
Well you're supposed to use side A
it won't tape it doesn't matter .
"But it does to them, because they've got side A and side B on every tape."
Yeah.
"And if they haven't got  side  side one tape two following  I mean side two side, tape two side A following tape one side B, it puts them out a bit I should think  are you going up the dog path?"
"Yeah, come on ."
"When, when did you get all this stock of perfume?"
"Erm, four years ago, three or four years ago  ."
.
"He went out on Christmas Eve, to find you present"
"That's right, I remember that ."
"and he got this job lot of  perfume, and he said oh I can shot these out over the next few years, I said, oh if you really want to ."
Where does he keep them?
"I've no idea, in fact last year, did he give you some last year?"
"I can't remember ,"
"Yes, he did ."
"he said alright, I, I, I was in trouble because I forgot where I hid them."
A miniature one.
I had to look in the top of his wardrobe.
You'll have to look somewhere.
"Take it all away, he probably gave it to girls at work as well or something."
Yes.
"Well no, cos it would be too late after Christmas wouldn't it?"
"Probably, no he doesn't give presents ."
"Oh he does, he gives er his secretary and switch board girl a box of chocolates and a bottle of wine and  but I do all the Christmas cards"
"Yeah, I know you do"
No.
"The, the  yeah."
What have you told  only you haven't told Gwyllam  anything have you?
"Cos you, what you've told him is  did you talk about chapter eight?"
No.
No.
"I, I just said to him, when he said we've got these census point ahead I said well  we've got certain restrictions, you know, we've certain rules and regulations we've gotta comply with  I mean I didn't reel off any of this  blah."
"But I said oh, are you familiar with setting up roadside interviews and  for this type of thing?"
"Oh yes, we've got such and such a fella out there that does nothing but that out all day long."
And yet they didn't have any signs  so I think he's talking through his hat.
But what he probably means is that they set up signs for
Yeah.
"you know, roadworks and stuff."
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I mean I would have thought they've gotta comply with the same
Yeah.
the same sort of things.
"I think the thing is, actually, just thinking about it, there will be a Welsh version of this  if there is one if you see what I mean?"
Yeah.
"If there isn't one  then we, we er er it  er  oh mind you I suppose there's no hassle to them to put a Welsh thingy, anyway I'll look at that."
"Right, now the other thing is that what Jim's doing which is that programme, how is that coming along?"
Yeah.
What I did  was I got  I went down to the print room and I got a piece of A one paper and  I mean if you want to use  Chris
"Chris  over in Chester office, see if, that one would, oh mind you there isn't a chair there is there?"
Mind you is Jonathan away?
There's this chair here.
Jonathan's not here.
Is Jonathan away?
"Yes, two day a day and a half or something, two days?"
Right.
"So, you know, there's desks around anyway"
Yeah.
Go on then.
"Why people think it's noisy for us on a double main road, but it ain't really."
"Well, you get used it in don't ya."
"When our Norma come and stop here, she she was,"
Used to sleep
I don't know how you sleep all night with all that traffic going up and down.
No.
But we never hear it.
You don't hear it.
"No, we didn't."
"I remember one  first night we stopped there, buses were coming at crack of dawn,"
Yeah.
"it must have been about four or five o'clock in morning, and now we never hear any traffic."
No.
No.
Perhaps you get used to.
Yeah.
"But we don't hear many people, on a road like that."
No.
"I were thinking about that bungalow, and, well actually it's as far from  our road, nearly as far from our road to there, as what is it from bungalow window to road."
Where to  yeah.
it really is
"Know, thinking about people walking back as far as t' shopping my point."
"There nowt much difference in, from t' garden"
"I think the only trouble over there, is your to gonna have people parking in front of ya gate, like when they go to the chip shop."
They won't
Yeah.
"They won't 'cos 'cos er, I'm afraid if they do, I shall be out straight away at 'em."
"Well, it's only a matter of parking at, parking your own car as well"
"I'll clamp the bugger, I'll buy a wheel clamp and wheel clamp it."
Park here at your risk.
"And everything's very nice , lovely!"
Mm.
"Because you want the right size  join  what you put in  they hadn't got any, no more of these"
No I said to Geoff well I hope he don't come back.
Who?
They're supposed to
"That bloke, I don't want him coming"
.
"Well dear you won't worry, I'll shall soon tell him to !"
"You ought to  you ought to say to him, I shall ring the police, you come round here any more!"
"people in the, in the  bay I wouldn't"
No I'm not!
"I don't want him, it worried me that he might come and bother your mother."
Yeah.
No!
There's no  this time.
I can stick up for myself!
Oh!
So he won't  you just don't
I did that
I know you can.
old bloke!
"End of the day   and if you don't let him in, he don't have to have any"
No.
anyway!
"Well I tell you something if he ke , if he does start to hassle us I shall ring the police and I shall tell them!"
Mm.
I should use
"I shan't have no qualms about it, I shall say well he's hassling  me and my mother-in-law and we can do without it!"
"That old boy that I spoke to, when his  he was with his daughter, I said you give me my bloody keys and you  money!"
I gotta move!
I said well there's a wheelbarrow down there mate!
I ended up paying for him.
"She's not bothered, she never goes near him."
Never goes near him.
She never goes near him.
She's frightened to death of 'im
isn't it.
I know.
But I don't think Geoff would be very pleased.
"Well, if you say to him, that just say that  and that, that's you know, oh, just say something like, just say something like  I can't keep up with him Dennis, he's throwing loads of dust about, just say to him,think about selling, to you want to buy him back or, you know."
"Well, they won't, I don't think they'd have him back."
No and that's  a
"I don't think, I don't think sell him."
Has he got to wait.
A.
I don't think you'd get what you paid for him.
"Probably not, but I mean, cage is worth a hundred and fifty quid."
That's what Russell paid for the cage.
"Oh, look."
Mm
"Oh, look."
What.
"Look,"
"that he's into,"
"Well, I mean, he's no problem to me."
I'm not bothered about him.
"You know, I'd rather keep him than sell him, but"
"It's like everything else, you've always summat else to bloody feed."
Mm.
"By the way, when we had that pair, that were driving me mad, and then that one died, when we were in bungalow."
"Other one would learnt how to open a crack, and it were in that cage, and it could hear birds outside."
"Anyway in the end we let er Kenny's grandad have 'im, I mean, 'cos they got me mum's bird."
"They've got two of his own, he ended up with four birds."
"I think they were frightening years ago when they, when we were kids so they're frightening places."
"Well we had no, we had no erm  nothing to stop the pain."
No.
"We had no injections, we were just put in a chair and, and it cost"
That's right
two guineas for every filling
"I know, it's a lot of money."
I mean
"Yeah, week's wages yeah."
"But we, he didn't get more than two or three guineas a week did he when we were first"
"That's right, yeah yes"
"Then we get, I know  our dentist was very good, we've always said that if we had a good dentist and a good doctors we're on our holidays, and we have, we've been lucky wherever we've been"
Mm.
Mm.
"we've had good dentists, good doctors."
Oh it pays you to get a sympathetic one and one that's er not on the
But this one is lovely.
"This one's  young and he's so gentle, you know he"
Yes.
Oh they're marvellous.
"I think that's what Tony's harking back to, the old style when you went and they were a bit er callous."
"Yes indeed well,young, how old is he?"
Twenty  five?
"He's only in his twenties, yeah he ought not, no it wouldn't be would it?"
No.
"Twenty years ago they were, they were alright weren't they?"
What am I thinking about?
No I'm thinking about
"Well you know the first time I went was  oh I dunno, before the war you know when I was about four or five and I went to get one out  I mean my parents"
"but it was terrible I was screaming, I was terrified and, and, and I can still see the place you know, there's something very foreboding about the, the place and the chair was like a"
And everything was hard
wasn't it?
Get Bert on the phone I want a word with him now.

Yeah.
or with a specific letter  for them saying you know welcome if you  if you feel like it.
Actually just just quickly  er I just noticed on that list of your  questionnaires that we got back a couple  that they didn't actually know what was going on.
And that you know perhaps this is er erm publicity wise I wonder whether we're falling a bit short on our  publicity.
Well.
they didn't know  I mean  like first newsletter we've had in ages.
And it's something else that we need to get
we can't just sort of
No exactly
"We've got to get, we should get more publicity."
But it's ever so easy for somebody to sit at home and say well you should be doing this and you should be doing that
Oh yeah yeah.
and not doing
"No I'm I'm not sa , I'm not saying."
I'm not saying you should be  doing anything I'm just er
"No I didn't mean you, I meant them!"
No well .
I well really  I don't think you should say  you're not doing enough!
No
I think last year more or less shows that we really have to concentrate on one thing.
Do it and then plan
Yeah.
plan the next .
Because otherwise we just
And then write about it if we want to.
Yeah.
So what what we'll do quickly  to write and inform them all that we're doing this stall and   won't we?
Yes.
We could even send them  a recycling sheet.
Yeah.
And the most recent newsletter.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But at least they were happy, you know what I mean."
'Cos they were with other birds.
"But I never missed, I never missed him."
I don't think you get attached to birds like you do animals.
I don't think you get attached to birds like dogs.
Not like dogs and cats.
No.
"I mean Albert said,if we do get that bungalow, we are  'cos the owner, he said she'll disappear."
She'll disappear.
"I mean I'll be upset about our Whisky, 'cos we're, I mean, we've had a long time, although she's not a pet  pet, you know what I mean."
What  feel like.
"Well, they they just, they go away when you take them somewhere fresh."
and they don't know where they are.
That one.
They're very very
"Sometimes, you're lucky, and you know, if if you keep them in long enough"
"We've always had cats, always had cats, when we lived at  and we moved into  and we'd had this one cat years, it were old cat."
"I wouldn't say it was ready for popping off, you know what I mean."
Yeah
"It were always fit and we were only there a fortnight, three weeks disappeared."
"I mean, if our Whisky died, I wouldn't be as upset about it, as I would about these."
But if she disappeared I'd be worried all time.
And yet
Aye.
"You know, like when our Dawn's kittens disappeared."
"It, they weren't bothered, I think Mick took them away meself."
Yeah.
I'm convinced he did.
I think he did.
"But I were I were upset about that, you know."
without a break.
"Two weeks' time, we've got a week off."
"I haven't even looked, cos I don't even, I haven't even thought about it, you know."
"Everyone else keeps going on about it, and all like, oh, I can't go home, cos there's not enough"
"Last year, reading week was, it seemed for ages, wasn't it?"
"It did, didn't it, yeah."
"It seemed weird, it was so,oh, it's nearly November, I'm getting worried."
That's alright.
It's nearly Christmas.
"Oh, that's alright."
"Half my year's gonna be gone, and I'm sort of, going for the third year, and it's really heavy."
Oh.
It's going so quick.
But erm  I'm sure you're right.
"Maybe I have done, maybe it's just not printing it."
"They normally have one a year, they probably just haven't edited up."
"We had two though, didn't we?"
"Didn't we have one la in the second year,or something, I'm sure we did."
We didn't Rebecca.
"Oh, didn't we  oh, that's what it is, then, you get yours in February."
That's what I'm saying to you.
"Ah, bit silly though, innit, starting"
I'm sure we had another reading week.
"Oh, shit, you're just like me, you are."
"I swear blue in the face that I'm right, and then somebody comes on and goes  oh yeah."
"Well, put it this way, if it isn't on Sunday,"
"it's a bit of a long time, because I come back January the fourteenth, fourteenth, and I've had all Christmas off, haven't I?"
"So I'm gonna be back, like a week, you think they'd make it a bit more  so I've done most of"
"No, I know what I'm thinking of, I'm, if ever, I'm thinking of revision week, cos that was a week, we  wasn't it?"
Yeah.
And then we had another revision week in June.
"See , there's two revision weeks, and a reading week."
"Yeah, and"
See they'll maintain that
Yeah that's right!
Social security .
I said you're paid the same.
No.
Social security is when you haven't got no money  and he has got money.
Well I ain't got any but they won't give me any!
Well that's like when older people when they save for their  retirement and that  you know
Yeah.
they can't get things cheap like bus passes and all that can they?
No.
"Well  Well I think, I, I don't think it pays you to save up  er"
No.
for your retirement and so you'll be comfortable off  cos you might as well live off your state like everybody else.
Yeah.
You might
"as well enjoy your money as you go along, why bother to have any!"
They were saying on the television the other day
Why bother!
the new taxes
"Well I certainly isn't going to, Sarah!"
The new tax law thing
I shall get as much out the system as I can mate!
Me me.
Well I told you that.
if they go up  erm  the government now wanna
Help!
"bring this new tax, but instead of poll tax and community charge and that  it's gonna be like a new erm  property tax."
"Oh yeah, I think I've heard of that."
"And er  what they're saying that, sort of, you get people, shall we say, older people who"
He's
are retired so they got no income  and then perhaps been left the house
"It's gotten on to her land  and off her land and into the ditch, which is  you know the N R A"
Where is that?
Er  Roydon some way?
You know where all those nurseries are?
And because the oil is coming  to the ditch via her land they can't have a go at the primary source.
"This is what she said and I, to me it doesn't sound right."
She said nobody'll  Nob they all say they haven't got the power to prosecute and I said well the N R A has.
They've got more clout than anybody else.
Mm.
More clout than the District Council.
And then she keeps saying but you know what these councils are like.
"And I said I'm not talking about the council, I'm talking about the N R A!"
And now she wants me  to find out how can er found out about a solicitor or somebody who specialises in this sort of thing.
To take the District Council to court.
So that she's more expensive to them  than this other lot will be.
Apparently they're causing quite te dreadful pollution.
It's all this oil  from the boilers leaking on to her  into her soil and out into the ditch.
Well
Certainly is.
"But erm  in the back of my mind there comes  that she's saying to me  don't get involved, don't get involved."
"You know who owns all that land, it's the mafia."
And this could be why she's getting nowhere.
"You could give her er erm er wr , give her the address of Friends of the Earth, London."
Oh she's already .
That's how she got in contact with me!
You see they refer everybody on and then I
"Well but they should give her a soli , the name of a solicitor."
There must be green solicitors about.
I  have to write to them and ask them and about a month later they reply to me and I pass it on to her.
Because I don't know off hand.
"I've asked Jeffrey to ask a friend about it who's a  solicitor if he knows anybody but I c , I can't  I haven't got the in information."
I don't
You know what you're getting because we've had it before.
"So then I got back on to Gwyllam  and said that if we provided our own caravan, would you  someone there be willing to do the  from site to site and he said that wouldn't be a problem."
Right.
But he doesn't know any details.
Okay.
Er you know I mean just like we don't.
We don't know dates or anything yet do we?
No.
So I think we've developed in that direction that I can go ahead as soon as I've got some dates and book it properly with Mr .
I think that's probably the best.
And just let these do the transporting because this  this fella honest to god he was doing me head in.
"Erm  saying oh one left, we've got a contract with the B B C you know, isn't it."
Oh and if he said it once well he said it half a dozen times  trying to impress me.
So let's stick to Mr .
We know where we are with him.
"Oh right, yes well I'm quite happy with that."
Right.
Er so the only other thing are the automatic counters then isn't it?
Mm.
Yeah.
"And we, we've got to wait for erm  Mel  to be in tomorrow."
Haven't we?
Yeah.
And we're obviously going to ask him to
"He, he"
to go ahead with it.
"looks after, I, I'm not sure exactly what he does, but he does sort of look after  the Welsh Office's own traffic counting programme."
Mm.
They have a sort of programme of their own  on er doing counts on roads.
I mean  a and most of it's done through the county councils.
"So we'll have certain sites that are counted and they have the, the equipment."
"Er when we last did the work there in nineteen eighty nine he'd, he'd provided  Gwyneth with three machines which they moved round and put on different places for us."
"But then again, if, even Kay over there with  she said something about er, oh we've been out, but, I told you I went to a  last Monday."
Yeah.
"and she said something about, oh we've been to that new pub, she said, mind, she said, we had to come home at half past nine, she said, he'd had enough, she said, he were ready for bed, God, she said he's turning into a right old man, and you know what I mean, she didn't, she wouldn't,"
Exactly.
"She didn't realise what she was saying as such, but I thought, and I thought, yeah I know."
"Yeah, well he is, what ten years."
Thirteen you got from 'er.
Thirteen years difference.
"She's, how old am I, twenty-two, so she's twenty-nine."
Same age as our Kim
Yeah.
"Oh she'll be coming at thirty this year, won't she?"
"You see, she's just coming into her prime, and now he's he's just leaving it."
yeah.
He's really forty-three this year.
Don't work.
"He'll be forty-three this year, and she'll be thirty this year."
"The only thing, time that happens is, that is you hear about,"
Look George
"if yo if one's fifty over sixty,"
He's plucking his feathers out.
then it works.
"But when your younger it, or even when you're young, you know, it does."
But when you get into your forties
"Well, it's like, I mean like,"
It works.
I'm  me and Colin are settling down a lot compared to what we were five year ago.
"I mean, like, like now, we were a, say even two and three years ago and  somebody'd said to me, are you going to Spain, and I would have said, yeah, we'll go to Majorca, lovely, we could stop out all night, do what you want."
"Now only three or four years later I'd say of yeah we're go to somewhere a bit quieter, so that kids can go to bed of a night time, we could have a  apartment."
"Yeah, that's right, yeah."
Yeah.
"And that, I'm changing that way, but, if our kids have to be home with the, a group, when I went to see Squeeze."
More than half the people don't want any help at all.
"Well, I think that's, we can accept the point easily."
"erm Quite a lot of help required in areas of the remit of this committee I would guess, things like home, security and safety, heating down here, quite a lot of people want help with heating."
"they're both, press it hard  right that's going."
"Press the one, the black one behind there to switch it off."
So we're on now are we?
Come on beauty
Have you made any tea?
No.
"Oh dear, oh dear oh dear."
Oh you   hello little doggy.
"Try cooking this ham, do you think they might like it then?"
Sorry?
The ham.
The dogs.
Try cooking it.
Oh.
Well wouldn't be able  tempt them into er
I mean really they should    they don't mind
Well that's the availability of the things isn't it?
I think you might have to er  take him down the road  afterwards  when it clears up.
Oh you're not going to take them with you?
Well  See how it goes
It's going off a bit now isn't it?
Oh no.
Erm  you do realize this ham is already cooked don't you?
No.
No.
"Thought it might, they won't eat it like that, that's"
Have they not eaten anything at all?
I haven't given them anything yet.
Mm.
"because if if you do that, and it begins to erm o occur to her and if she's fairly bright"
Mm she doesn't seem daft yeah.
"She's not clever cos she's  bearings ,"
Erm it it it no
she doesn't seem engineering clever.
No.
But she's not daft.
No but but you're gonna help them.
Yeah yeah.
You're going to your object in life is to help her do the job better.
Right.
And explain to her.
And by sitting down and having a technical and commercial conversation together
Mm.
you can sort of chair that that
Mm.
meeting and help her to understand
how much we're helping them through this  .
and appreciate how much else we can do.
And and okay if we're a pound or two different.
We're forty minutes up the road.
Yeah.
Yeah.
If we can't e e I've had a couple of months of stock on the shelf for 'em.
Yeah.
"In fact I must admit, I hinted to Dave  if if linear will do consignment stock for , why shouldn't we if we're only forty minutes away."
But I mean that's the last thing I wanna do but
Yeah.
"but even then we could have consignment stock here in effect cos they're only forty minutes away, we could throw 'em in the back of the car and have 'em delivered."
"Well that's what we've got we've got consignment stock here, it's on our premises"
Yeah.
mm.
"And she said er  well it does take time for them to dry out doesn't it, she said?"
"But I, there was people in it last week!"
"Yes I know, she said!"
Well if she's covering
I said well there's no way I
she is paid to cover the boss!
"There's no way I'd of slept in it, I said and not  I wouldn't of done it!"
"Let alone, old age pensioners, I said!"
And you know  we've been to a few caravans
Go in that end bedroom and feel the bed!
"that feel a bit, caravans that we used to go to were like this chalet."
The chalets we used to go to  Mrs er  I can't remember her name now!
But her boys used to run steam roller outside middle house and I used to take them in.
She used to see  that the beds were aired.
She did see to them!
She put oil heaters  in the caravan  and she kept the  the mattresses in her bungalow!
She'd only got about eight caravans then.
"And  then we went in and had a caravan  somewhere up by Aberystwyth, Ginnie and me, and you kids."
That was an old farmer's caravan weren't
Yes.
it?
"But it wasn't too, that was too damp to sleep on!"
"who won the bloody war,roof up weren't it !"
"There wasn't, there wasn't a cup and saucer each!"
Remember?
Mm.
And these are no better!
"I mean, caravans are caravans, call them what you like!"
Only one saucepan we had!
And it was stew everyday if we didn't go out for dinner!
Ah!
But what if they don't.
You've lost all your  ain't ya.
"Ya, so that's  the end of the world."
Even if you find out they won't.
No.
Why don't you get a free  put on market.
"No, the on the company's, that's coming up with all the money got to"
Oh aye.
do the valuation.
"And they ought to form  value of what, so they know how much it's worth, what the company that's gonna earn them the money want the money for the valuation."
It's just another way of making a bit more money out it.
That's it.
"Well, it's same as when you buying and selling 'ouses."
"You  when it comes out, when, the people that's, mind me cigarette, darling, the people that's gonna buy your 'ouse, who, mortgage company comes out and values it, they've got that to pay as well haven't they."
Yeah.
"The same as, I, them that buys our 'ouse, they'll have to pay whatever it cost for 'em to value our 'ouse, see if it's worth lending money, we'll have the same thing with er bungalow, down there."
Yeah.
"It's only money  I mean, how long are they 'ere."
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
"Mean, that woman come out, when when we had this done, didn't she,"
Mm.
To to see if it were satisfac she weren't here three minutes.
No.
"What was that for, for"
You know when we had extension put up.
"Oh yeah, yeah,"
"Well,"
Did it  value.
"They sent they sent 'em out from er, Abbey National and we had to pay, well we did pay 'im fifty pound, people that put the building on paid."
she keeps getting up.
She's not.
"Yeah, so said it was that  spaghetti Bolognese that did it."
Makes you thirsty.
Mm.
"Well, it's probably"
Mm.
it's probably that.
Maybe it is a flu going around then.
Well these all need to be  well I mean quite often this stuff we can
Throw?
"no, no, half of this stuff we can actually  keep bi , or or leave, leave for them because it's actually  relevant information."
What leave them bills and everything?
No I mean it's
And guarantees?
"Well it's no damn good to us once we've moved, is it?"
"Ooh God, they've had the house at a cheap rate anyway!"
They can damn well pay for these stuff if it breaks down!
That's not the point!
Just stop it!
Are we taking the cooker with us or not?
"Not the cooker, no."
"So they get i ,we will work pay for all our appliances and stuff?"
Eh?
Will work pay for all our appliances?
"Not all of them, no."
"Well a lot of , yeah?"
And water softener as well?
All those big salt pebble things I have to fill up every week in the ?
Well I guess we may get a  we may get ourselves a  waste disposable unit.
Good!
"Get one of those we got  in, particularly in favour of those."
Does she like them?
Stick some raw eggs and things down there.
"your letters look nice and neat, mine are always scraggy, I can never understand them."
"Dear Helena, I don't really  rea really know how to put this but I've had  I'll have a go."
I'm sorry about being in a mood on Saturday but I wasn't really in a mood with you.
I'll now tol t no  I know I told you that I was  that I was feeling
"That, that's"
sorry for someone not Emma or
he's done a sentence wrong there.
one like that .
Yeah.
I care for Emma more than I can say but I also care for you and I'm really sorry if you were hurt.
At the moment everyone has been talking about other people behind people's backs.
I didn't tell you what Emma thought because I  don't   is that a blank page?
Yeah.
I don't think a person told  I don't think a person told to  apologize isn't rea really an apology so I think there must be a reason why you didn't and so told me on Sunday why you didn't .
What a load of waffle.
"Oh I know, he just waffles."
I was going to apologize for being  stupid on Sunday when you both disappeared.
"Me and Andy looked all over, looked for both of you."
Last night I had a few things on my mind to be able to  apologize.
I'm sorry and hope we can still be friends .
I read it and I just went  what! for a start and then
"I went, and then I went  well he can't have looked around for us too well because we were walking by the side of the road."
But  yeah he probably come past  no he probably went up there as we come down that corner  by erm Ipsleigh and when they come back we'd probably gotten here by then.
"But we, I mean we were walking by the side of the road all the way up Greenlands Drive."
"What did I say, Scott then had the cheek to something me?"
"Wish me, that was it wasn't it?"
Scott's not your best friend at the moment then?
"Oh you may not have, you may have gathered that like anyway."
Erm enough  enough  of slagging   slagging  the little shit I think
The little shit .
shit stirrer.
"No, yes, shit ?"
Yeah.
and then someone scores and the guy goes in straight calmly and scores straight away.
You know it's people aren't
Yeah.
"I don't know, it's psychologically sort of still got their mind on going through what's er"
On what happened.
Yeah.
"It's like at school when they're thinking oh no, no and they've scored again."
"It's like you've scored, you're so elated and you"
Fact you you often sort of watch videos of managers.
"Managers are often shrieking you know about what's happening next rather than you know, all their players are jumping with joy all over each other and you think  and they're saying get in your positions."
Do your stuff.
"Don't let it slip straight away, I mean  That was annoying thing is that we didn't deserve to lose three one really, I mean"
Sneak that  that box of sweets in then for mum .
I bet she knows you've done that for her.
Eh?
I bet she knows you've bought that for her.
"Well she knows that we're giving her something, yes."
"I mean we could have been worse, could have forgotten completely."
"I mean it's easy, cos when mum gets all those things for everybody else, clearly she doesn't get something for herself."
Don't know why not.
What did you get her last year?
It was the same thing wasn't it?
"No I didn't get, we didn't do this did we, last year?"
Yes we did.
We always have the tree presents.
Do we?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
You what?
Our sunroof's pretty isn't it?
Very stylish.
What's the time?
You'd think after that one they'd have thrown the keys away for that.
Mm.
The kid hadn't done much
Get an extra two years for missing.
"the kid hadn't done much, I mean it was nowt  serious ."
You know I had a moving traffic accident
Yeah
"wasn't trucking there, you know  or owt like that."
No sense of humour.
Got brought a pushbike wheel the other day.
Can you get the cogs off that?
Why?
Well they go a lot better on that bike of mine.
I don't think so.
Oh pity.
So what you've done to bend the wheel?
I haven't.
"The gaffer knocked somebody off their pushbike, had to buy him a new wheel  and some compensation"
Scrounge the wheel!
How do you get them off?
He says you go to a pushbike shop and get special tools.
Ring spanner things with the
Mm.
keys on the outside  pumps and things on it to  I wouldn't bother.
A new set of back cogs for bike's only about seven quid.
"A brand new set and they come with the ra with the, erm free wheel and everything all in like, just screw them on."
"Go to a pushbike shop they whip them off and whip them on for you  you buy, you know, if you go out and buy one then just take wheel with you they'll stick them straight on."
Mm   that fellow don't go to the police.
Lucky to get away with having to buy him a wheel  compensation
Unusual innit.
It's very expensive that's why it's unusual.
Sixty nine ninety nine.
Yeah.
"if they don't, that's it."
"They don't come and look at your 'ouse, they come have a look at what they can do with it, you now, have a look like, why you got extension and,"
I don't mind beds being untidy and things like that.
No.
"I mean, you don't look at, your not, who's sleeping in your bed."
"When ours were, it was a right state when we looked at ours, but we still said we'd have it."
"Mind, it's just that, it's worth nowt as we've  name it."
We'll get it right one day.
"One day, Karen, one day."
When the moon comes up and it's in two.
When the
You got two moons.
"Yeah, all I wanted was go in and, now we're bankrupt and we're nowt where we are."
If we were well off we could get it done.
"You'd be employing, you'd be employing builders to come in and do it for you."
"Yeah, that's what I said, it'd be nice, wannit."
It would.
your half of next door to get some
"Remember, remember, if you want taking anywhere, it's er, is it four pound ten an hour  chauffeurs."
Yeah.
"What I mean you have to put petrol in, I mean, it doesn't"
"No, you have to put petrol in."
"Do you hell, not at four pound an hour."
Walk.
"One fifty an hour, driving."
"Ain't it four fifty an hour  chauffeuring, and he puts petrol in, and taxes and insures car."
Bugger off.
Back of the bloody van.
"You can't go in van with ya, with ya suit on, and"
"Oh, you've got to, you go play your part."
"You got to have a chauffeur, you'll have to buy me a hat  you'll have to buy me a hat  you'll have to make it worth me while coming off dole at forty pound a week."
You're not supposed to know .
"Oh my, I'm not supposed to see."
Switch it off now for a few minutes.
Okay?
Ah ah!
I'll leave you with that.
The  worm.
Look at these flowers!
So these are lovely!
Mm mm.
Five cheesies to one slurp of drink.
Hmm mm.
Why is it pure gin?
I think Ted would be proud of me.
"Well, my stars say   if you find yourself at a low ebb this weekend don't worry."
Every so often we all need to wind down.
There you are.
"If your a little numb, cynical, or apathetic it's probably a healthy sign."
It simply means you're in the process of recharging your batteries and reassessing your priorities .
Well Anna-Marie is there something you want to tell us?
I'm Cancer.
What does it say about me.
Mm.
Market forces do not make the world go round.
"The earth does not spin on its axis for profit, the sun does not shine because it happens to have shares in a household firm."
"If any force guides the universe, universe, it surely must be love."
"In allowing yourself to be led now by the same illogical but kind motive, you are not being as silly as you think."
"Indeed, the more selfless you can be this weekend, the better things will work out"
Oh how nice.
That sounds good to me .
What's Virgo?
Better .
Let's hope he gets off the floor.
"walking across roads a risk, ain't it."
Yeah.
It's ju just if you've got the nerve to do it.
"It's a risk with these buggers, what's in power, aye, it's no matter what whose in power."
I got
"I think if labour gets in, you'll not get it tough at all."
"I can tell you that, now."
Oohh.
What?
Oohh.
"You feel like  er, that's whose, like ex soldiers  throughout the company, and he said to Colin er, he said, how many people are you thinking about employ , our Colin seems to think there'd be enough work to keep 'im going, like, he says, he says, well how many people are you thinking about employing, he says, only only me and me  like, it's oh, oh, he says, there's plenty of work to keep two of going, he said, I thought you employed about six."
"So if he thinks that Colin do have six working for him, and he's got enough work for six, then surely there's gonna be plenty of work for two of 'em."
"Yeah, but what he means by six is, he gets the jobs done quicker"
"Yeah, but then you still got six wages to pay out, haven't ya."
Yeah.
That's it.
"He probably will have six later on, if he gets it off, but  the thing is, I mean, he'll need somebody to drive wagons round yard, and half the time,y you know, he'll be sat doing nothing, scratching his nose."
"Them's the people he's got to be wary of, the people that want a job, but don't wanna work for it."
"There's a hell of a lot in Broadway and Stainford,"
Yeah.
round about here.
"Mind Lee's a, Lee's a good worker, he says that, he wants, you know, best worker what he can"
"Yeah, but I mean, working for a mate, is different to working for a firm."
Yeah.
"You know, I mean"
"Well, he's not a mate, he won't, he's working with him when he were at er  over in Brad oh, here's Richard now."
"Aye, you'd better jump in bed with him,"
"Oh dear, no but he is, Richard is the one with the  comical magazine,laughing bursts two incomes."
I think that's part of
Yes.
"Look, slow down, or you're driving me mad."
Makes a little noise click click click click.
Can I have a chip does anybody hi Rita
Hi.
Lovely Rita meter
Oh don't please.
I hate that isn't it awful to be obvious.
Well that's what everybody sings to me when them and they meet me for the first time or get introduced to me.
Oh they don't.
Where are you calling from we're very loud with callers today I know I'm not the most exciting thing on radio but you know there must be some callers out there somewhere?
Where am I.
I'm at a little place called Ellenthorpe.
Ellenthorpe.
Is the weather as bad as people keep telling me because it was Okay when I drove in this morning.
"No it's not it's it's quite mild, there's no frost on the ground it's all gone."
So what's this about snow at Thirsk?
Well they can keep it we don't want it.
Bit strange in Thirsk anyway I thought.
I think there'd probably somebody with expanded polystyrene ceiling that's been pulled out.
Probably.
Yeah it's it's actually it's not too bad it's a bit misty it's a bid hazy erm slight wind but it's not bad.
It's not?
No it's not bad
No Okay.
I've just got to get something do you mind?
No go and get your chips or whatever.
No I've got I've got  I wanted t
It's all right my hubby can wait for his lunch I aren't bothered.
Jolly well ought to as well.
Er I wanted to talk to Jim Bowen you see about this quiz show host ought to be a a little nicer than they are and apparently his answer machine is on at home.
Well I must admit James I've threatened to put mine on.
Have you?
Well Karen said that if I won the competition she'd ring back.
There's that other roundabout isn't there?
You know where the horses were in the field?
That was a four armed roundabout.
Just down from
Yeah.
the station house place where we parked
You'll find that erm  the flows there are very low.
So you think we could get away with treating that as a crossroads and have people
I reckon
doing that?
I reckon
"Well we could have a person counting and not only are they counting what's coming out of their junction, but they could do left, straight on or right."
Treat it as a crossroads  perhaps.
"I reckon  si yes four or six people would cover that, no problem."
I think you'll find the flow is a  a low
it wasn't busy when we were there was it?
"No I mean it may be, you know you  i it may be reasonably busy straight through but I would have thought even there you're probably talking about four  not a lot higher than that I wouldn't have thought."
No.
Okay I'll take four people
And erm we're going very round very slow.
And the visibility was good and everything.
"So I'd have thought that erm  you could put four or six, four or six people on that."
And actually if we just counted this  to through traffic wouldn't be too much
Hello  right.
your pudding?
What erm  have you heard any of it?you have.
What did it sound like?
It's good.
We both just said that it ne you'd never think that you sound right on  tape.
I always think I sound high pitched.
sounds all like bloody  what she does say.
Yeah
Yeah
"They come through the doorstep, through the doors though."
Through the door they they just throw them away.
They didn't read them.
"I said well don't you live in Stortford, didn't you have it delivered?"
No.
And I'm sure they'll pick them up if they see them in the
If they printed
print them up and they do it on their own  will.
Couldn't we do it with him?
With him?
Well yeah pro
I mean they could couldn't they sponsor us to do it or something?
"Well yeah I I've I've  whether he  well I mean if, if he's gonna do this seven page thing then  I you know I  you can look at it two ways."
Either we can influence and help that to be  to be good or or  you know if that's a failure then  see whether they can help us to produce one for the town.
Mm.
I mean I'd much rather they do it  if we can influence him enough.
They've got the right information.
"Well the thing if we did it with our  as they keep saying there's some, there's so much in the pipeline."
I mean it might take us another  two week two months before we get it out.
Three months.
Well
I would say six months.
Yeah
No I would just think of something really straightforward.
"They do want stuff on local levels I mean if he's East Herts he's got a huge area, hasn't he?"
Yeah.
It it might be a help to him to have little local groups that  helped him out with these things.
But I mean if we print something and then suddenly they instal all these new bottle banks which we didn't know about.
Then they are not mentioned
Well
in our recycling directory and we can do the next one
Well Traidcraft's got loads to sell.
Not doing very well are you
No!
because I have this  erm dilemma.
Whether to just photocopy off a very good  original
Yeah
or do we print the whole lot.
And we came to the conclusion it was cheaper to print
Oh
than photocopy.
What  it's a bit slow isn't it?
"Yeah it depends, well you can get get it to run through copies but  the problem is that the cartridges for these printers they, they cost about fifty pounds."
Mm
They're not cheap.
So if I can do one run and then photocopy it.
Mm.
It a is actually a lot better because you can get them usually get them down to about  five p a copy.
"Well won't you lose, lose definition on the drawing though with a laser printer?"
No.
No?
No it's even better
Oh that's alright.
"Okay, no it's, I'm just going by the one at school and it, because it's all made up of little dots you"
"No, this is a laser printer."
This does it absolutely  it's not a dot printer it's it is a laser printer .
"Oh, well he keeps calling it his laser printer!seen it in action we don't see that well."
"So you, you said you could do it for five p a copy?"
"Well I r , I r , I reckon I reckon you can down to that, yeah."
That's printing both sides.
Yeah.
double sided printer and I I'll try and get that verified but
I think we could sell it I think we could sell it for
Erm then.
"And er so I mean it's you know, I am a politician I mean you know, it's in the blood I've b been in the in the House of Commons now for about a quarter of a century."
"Over a quarter of a century, most of it on the front bench."
And erm I like it.
"But the fact is I mean I you know, you do ask these questions, your family make you ask these questions quite understandably."
I there are other things I could do.
I'm a manic gardener and I that's what I've been doing.
"Erm I could go back to commerce, although er that side of my life is some way behind and it it's always been very successfully done by er my colleagues in the company that I started."
"So er you know I I've I've never had a sort of er a one way track about politics, although I adore it and I've er I've enjoyed it hugely Am enjoying it and I"
"Ah I was going to pick  you said, I have enjoyed it hu I was about to leap in and say, Ah that means ."
Yes ye no no no no no no.
How kind.
"Well that's the value of a programme like this, you can correct."
Otherwise that'd be over the headlines.
"Heseltine says, Future"
Quite.
is in the past.
You know
Which is not exactly what I am saying.
Erm no the fact is that er I I love politics.
It's er and and I have always wanted to be president of the board of trade.
"But what about more ambition, further ambition now?"
Well that's a sort of wary question but all politicians
But you'd expect me to ask it.
I know you're bound to ask it.
And you I'm not going to give any different answer I've ever given.
I my belief is that John Major will win the next election.
"I helped to win the last one, I shall help to win the next one."
"And er er I I think that er all this sort of chat about leadership challenges and all that, I think that's for the birds."
I don't think we shall see it.
I especially I don't think so after after the very er impressive speech he made on Friday.
But there is We can come to that in a moment if we may.
"Rilla , be awfully good to mother while I 'm away ."
It must be a horrible thing to be a mother in this war -- the mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts have the hardest times .
"Rilla , you beautiful little thing , are you anybody 's sweetheart ?"
"If you are , tell me before I go . ''"
"`` No , '' said Rilla ."
"Then , impelled by a wish to be absolutely frank with Walter in this talk that might be the last they would ever have , she added , blushing wildly in the moonlight , `` but if -- Kenneth Ford -- wanted me to be -- '' `` I see , '' said Walter ."
"`` And Ken 's in khaki , too ."
"Poor little girlie , it 's a bit hard for you all round ."
"Well , I 'm not leaving any girl to break her heart about me -- thank God for that . ''"
Rilla glanced up at the Manse on the hill .
She could see a light in Una Meredith 's window .
She felt tempted to say something -- then she knew she must not .
"It was not her secret : and , anyway , she did not know -- she only suspected ."
Walter looked about him lingeringly and lovingly .
This spot had always been so dear to him .
What fun they all had had here lang syne .
"Phantoms of memory seemed to pace the dappled paths and peep merrily through the swinging boughs -- Jem and Jerry , bare-legged , sunburned schoolboys , fishing in the brook and frying trout over the old stone fireplace ; Nan and Di and Faith , in their dimpled , fresh-eyed childish beauty ; Una the sweet and shy , Carl , poring over ants and bugs , little slangy , sharp-tongued , good-hearted Mary Vance -- the old Walter that had been himself lying on the grass reading poetry or wandering through palaces of fancy ."
They were all there around him -- he could see them almost as plainly as he saw Rilla -- as plainly as he had once seen the Pied Piper piping down the valley in a vanished twilight .
"And they said to him , those gay little ghosts of other days , `` We were the children of yesterday , Walter -- fight a good fight for the children of to-day and to-morrow . ''"
"`` Where are you , Walter , '' cried Rilla , laughing a little ."
`` Come back -- come back . ''
Walter came back with a long breath .
"He stood up and looked about him at the beautiful valley of moonlight , as if to impress on his mind and heart every charm it possessed -- the great dark plumes of the firs against the silvery sky , the stately White Lady , the old magic of the dancing brook , the faithful Tree Lovers , the beckoning , tricksy paths ."
"`` I shall see it so in my dreams , '' he said , as he turned away ."
They went back to Ingleside .
"Mr. and Mrs. Meredith were there , with Gertrude Oliver , who had come from Lowbridge to say good-bye ."
"Everybody was quite cheerful and bright , but nobody said much about the war being soon over , as they had said when Jem went away ."
They did not talk about the war at all -- and they thought of nothing else .
"At last they gathered around the piano and sang the grand old hymn : `` Oh God , our help in ages past Our hope for years to come ."
Our shelter from the stormy blast And our eternal home . ''
"`` We all come back to God in these days of soul-sifting , '' said Gertrude to John Meredith ."
`` There have been many days in the past when I did n't believe in God -- not as God -- only as the impersonal Great First Cause of the scientists .
"I told him not at all ; that I had seen much to admire among the Highlanders ; and if he came to that , Mr. Campbell himself was a Highlander ."
"`` Ay , '' said he , `` that 's true ."
It 's a fine blood . ''
`` And what is the King 's agent about ? ''
I asked .
`` Colin Campbell ? ''
says Henderland .
`` Putting his head in a bees ' byke ! ''
"`` He is to turn the tenants out by force , I hear ? ''"
"said I. `` Yes , '' says he , `` but the business has gone back and forth , as folk say ."
"First , James of the Glens rode to Edinburgh , and got some lawyer -LRB- a Stewart , nae doubt -- they all hing together like bats in a steeple -RRB- and had the proceedings stayed ."
"And then Colin Campbell cam ' in again , and had the upper-hand before the Barons of Exchequer ."
And now they tell me the first of the tenants are to flit to-morrow .
"It 's to begin at Duror under James 's very windows , which doesnae seem wise by my humble way of it . ''"
`` Do you think they 'll fight ? ''
I asked .
"`` Well , '' says Henderland , `` they 're disarmed -- or supposed to be -- for there 's still a good deal of cold iron lying by in quiet places ."
And then Colin Campbell has the sogers coming .
"But for all that , if I was his lady wife , I wouldnae be well pleased till I got him home again ."
"They 're queer customers , the Appin Stewarts . ''"
I asked if they were worse than their neighbours .
"`` No they , '' said he ."
`` And that 's the worst part of it .
"For if Colin Roy can get his business done in Appin , he has it all to begin again in the next country , which they call Mamore , and which is one of the countries of the Camerons ."
"He 's King 's Factor upon both , and from both he has to drive out the tenants ; and indeed , Mr. Balfour -LRB- to be open with ye -RRB- , it 's my belief that if he escapes the one lot , he 'll get his death by the other . ''"
"So we continued talking and walking the great part of the day ; until at last , Mr. Henderland after expressing his delight in my company , and satisfaction at meeting with a friend of Mr. Campbell 's -LRB- `` whom , '' says he , `` I will make bold to call that sweet singer of our covenanted Zion '' -RRB- , proposed that I should make a short stage , and lie the night in his house a little beyond Kingairloch ."
"To say truth , I was overjoyed ; for I had no great desire for John of the Claymore , and since my double misadventure , first with the guide and next with the gentleman skipper , I stood in some fear of any Highland stranger ."
"Accordingly we shook hands upon the bargain , and came in the afternoon to a small house , standing alone by the shore of the Linnhe Loch ."
"The sun was already gone from the desert mountains of Ardgour upon the hither side , but shone on those of Appin on the farther ; the loch lay as still as a lake , only the gulls were crying round the sides of it ; and the whole place seemed solemn and uncouth ."
"We had no sooner come to the door of Mr. Henderland 's dwelling , than to my great surprise -LRB- for I was now used to the politeness of Highlanders -RRB- he burst rudely past me , dashed into the room , caught up a jar and a small horn-spoon , and began ladling snuff into his nose in most excessive quantities ."
"Then he had a hearty fit of sneezing , and looked round upon me with a rather silly smile ."
"`` It 's a vow I took , '' says he ."
"`` He 's the only boy we ever failed with , and I am so grieved , for I thought there was the making of a fine man in him , spite of his faults . ''"
"Dan heard Mrs. Bhaer sigh , and he wanted to ask for one more trial himself , but his pride would not let him , and he came out with the hard look on his face , shook hands without a word , and drove away with Mr. Bhaer , leaving Nat and Mrs. Jo to look after him with tears in their eyes ."
"A few days afterwards they received a letter from Mr. Page , saying that Dan was doing well , whereat they all rejoiced ."
"But three weeks later came another letter , saying that Dan had run away , and nothing had been heard of him , whereat they all looked sober , and Mr. Bhaer said , `` Perhaps I ought to have given him another chance . ''"
"Mrs. Bhaer , however , nodded wisely and answered , `` Do n't be troubled , Fritz ; the boy will come back to us , I 'm sure of it . ''"
But time went on and no Dan came .
CHAPTER VII .
"NAUGHTY NAN `` Fritz , I 've got a new idea , '' cried Mrs. Bhaer , as she met her husband one day after school ."
"`` Well , my dear , what is it ? ''"
"and he waited willingly to hear the new plan , for some of Mrs. Jo 's ideas were so droll , it was impossible to help laughing at them , though usually they were quite sensible , and he was glad to carry them out ."
"`` Daisy needs a companion , and the boys would be all the better for another girl among them ; you know we believe in bringing up little men and women together , and it is high time we acted up to our belief ."
"They pet and tyrannize over Daisy by turns , and she is getting spoilt ."
"Then they must learn gentle ways , and improve their manners , and having girls about will do it better than any thing else . ''"
"`` You are right , as usual ."
"Now , who shall we have ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , seeing by the look in her eye that Mrs. Jo had some one all ready to propose ."
`` Little Annie Harding . ''
`` What !
"Naughty Nan , as the lads call her ? ''"
"cried Mr. Bhaer , looking very much amused ."
"`` Yes , she is running wild at home since her mother died , and is too bright a child to be spoilt by servants ."
"I have had my eye on her for some time , and when I met her father in town the other day I asked him why he did not send her to school ."
He said he would gladly if he could find as good a school for girls as ours was for boys .
I know he would rejoice to have her come ; so suppose we drive over this afternoon and see about it . ''
"`` Have not you cares enough now , my Jo , without this little gypsy to torment you ? ''"
"asked Mr. Bhaer , patting the hand that lay on his arm ."
"`` Oh dear , no , '' said Mother Bhaer , briskly ."
"`` I like it , and never was happier than since I had my wilderness of boys ."
"You see , Fritz , I feel a great sympathy for Nan , because I was such a naughty child myself that I know all about it ."
"She is full of spirits , and only needs to be taught what to do with them to be as nice a little girl as Daisy ."
"Those quick wits of hers would enjoy lessons if they were rightly directed , and what is now a tricksy midget would soon become a busy , happy child ."
"I know how to manage her , for I remember how my blessed mother managed me , and -- '' `` And if you succeed half as well as she did , you will have done a magnificent work , '' interrupted Mr. Bhaer , who labored under the delusion that Mrs. B. was the best and most charming woman alive ."
"`` Oh , dear no !"
"I 'm the first boy Mrs. Jo ever had to take care of , and I was such a bad one that she is n't done with me yet , though she has been working at me for years and years . ''"
`` How old she must be ! ''
"said Nat , innocently ."
"`` She began early , you see ."
Poor thing !
"she was only fifteen when she took me , and I led her such a life , it 's a wonder she is n't wrinkled and gray , and quite worn out , '' and Mr. Laurie looked up at her laughing ."
"`` Do n't Teddy ; I wo n't have you abuse yourself so ; '' and Mrs. Jo stroked the curly black head at her knee as affectionately as ever , for , in spite of every thing Teddy was her boy still ."
"`` If it had n't been for you , there never would have been a Plumfield ."
"It was my success with you , sir , that gave me courage to try my pet plan ."
"So the boys may thank you for it , and name the new institution ` The Laurence Museum , ' in honor of its founder , wo n't we , boys ? ''"
"she added , looking very like the lively Jo of old times ."
`` We will !
we will ! ''
"shouted the boys , throwing up their hats , for though they had taken them off on entering the house , according to rule , they had been in too much of a hurry to hang them up ."
"`` I 'm as hungry as a bear , ca n't I have a cookie ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , when the shout subsided and he had expressed his thanks by a splendid bow ."
"`` Trot out and ask Asia for the gingerbread-box , Demi ."
"It is n't in order to eat between meals , but , on this joyful occasion , we wo n't mind , and have a cookie all round , '' said Mrs. Jo ; and when the box came she dealt them out with a liberal hand , every one munching away in a social circle ."
"Suddenly , in the midst of a bite , Mr. Laurie cried out , `` Bless my heart , I forgot grandma 's bundle ! ''"
"and running out to the carriage , returned with an interesting white parcel , which , being opened , disclosed a choice collection of beasts , birds , and pretty things cut out of crisp sugary cake , and baked a lovely brown ."
"`` There 's one for each , and a letter to tell which is whose ."
"Grandma and Hannah made them , and I tremble to think what would have happened to me if I had forgotten to leave them . ''"
"Then , amid much laughing and fun , the cakes were distributed ."
"A fish for Dan , a fiddle for Nat , a book for Demi , a money for Tommy , a flower for Daisy , a hoop for Nan , who had driven twice round the triangle without stopping , a star for Emil , who put on airs because he studied astronomy , and , best of all , an omnibus for Franz , whose great delight was to drive the family bus ."
"Stuffy got a fat pig , and the little folks had birds , and cats , and rabbits , with black currant eyes ."
`` Now I must go .
Where is my Goldilocks ?
"Mamma will come flying out to get her if I 'm not back early , '' said Uncle Teddy , when the last crumb had vanished , which it speedily did , you may be sure ."
"The young ladies had gone into the garden , and while they waited till Franz looked them up , Jo and Laurie stood at the door talking together ."
`` How does little Giddy-gaddy come on ? ''
"he asked , for Nan 's pranks amused him very much , and he was never tired of teasing Jo about her ."
Something about the firm outlines of Anne 's lips told that Mrs. Rachel was not far astray in this estimate .
Anne 's heart was bent on forming the Improvement Society .
"Gilbert Blythe , who was to teach in White Sands but would always be home from Friday night to Monday morning , was enthusiastic about it ; and most of the other folks were willing to go in for anything that meant occasional meetings and consequently some `` fun . ''"
"As for what the `` improvements '' were to be , nobody had any very clear idea except Anne and Gilbert ."
"They had talked them over and planned them out until an ideal Avonlea existed in their minds , if nowhere else ."
Mrs. Rachel had still another item of news .
`` They 've given the Carmody school to a Priscilla Grant .
"Did n't you go to Queen 's with a girl of that name , Anne ? ''"
"`` Yes , indeed ."
Priscilla to teach at Carmody !
How perfectly lovely ! ''
"exclaimed Anne , her gray eyes lighting up until they looked like evening stars , causing Mrs. Lynde to wonder anew if she would ever get it settled to her satisfaction whether Anne Shirley were really a pretty girl or not ."
II Selling in Haste and Repenting at Leisure Anne drove over to Carmody on a shopping expedition the next afternoon and took Diana Barry with her .
"Diana was , of course , a pledged member of the Improvement Society , and the two girls talked about little else all the way to Carmody and back ."
"`` The very first thing we ought to do when we get started is to have that hall painted , '' said Diana , as they drove past the Avonlea hall , a rather shabby building set down in a wooded hollow , with spruce trees hooding it about on all sides ."
`` It 's a disgraceful looking place and we must attend to it even before we try to get Mr. Levi Boulder to pull his house down .
Father says we 'll never succeed in DOING that .
Levi Boulter is too mean to spend the time it would take . ''
"`` Perhaps he 'll let the boys take it down if they promise to haul the boards and split them up for him for kindling wood , '' said Anne hopefully ."
`` We must do our best and be content to go slowly at first .
We ca n't expect to improve everything all at once .
"We 'll have to educate public sentiment first , of course . ''"
Diana was n't exactly sure what educating public sentiment meant ; but it sounded fine and she felt rather proud that she was going to belong to a society with such an aim in view .
"`` I thought of something last night that we could do , Anne ."
You know that three-cornered piece of ground where the roads from Carmody and Newbridge and White Sands meet ?
"It 's all grown over with young spruce ; but would n't it be nice to have them all cleared out , and just leave the two or three birch trees that are on it ? ''"
"`` Splendid , '' agreed Anne gaily ."
`` And have a rustic seat put under the birches .
And when spring comes we 'll have a flower-bed made in the middle of it and plant geraniums . ''
"`` Yes ; only we 'll have to devise some way of getting old Mrs. Hiram Sloane to keep her cow off the road , or she 'll eat our geraniums up , '' laughed Diana ."
"`` I begin to see what you mean by educating public sentiment , Anne ."
There 's the old Boulter house now .
"People thought the eager , enthusiastic little band who had worked so hard for their object had been badly used ."
Mrs. Lynde told them to keep on and show the Pyes that there really were people in the world who could do things without making a muddle of them .
"Mr. Major Spencer sent them word that he would clean out all the stumps along the road front of his farm and seed it down with grass at his own expense ; and Mrs. Hiram Sloane called at the school one day and beckoned Anne mysteriously out into the porch to tell her that if the `` Sassiety '' wanted to make a geranium bed at the crossroads in the spring they need n't be afraid of her cow , for she would see that the marauding animal was kept within safe bounds ."
"Even Mr. Harrison chuckled , if he chuckled at all , in private , and was all sympathy outwardly ."
"`` Never mind , Anne ."
"Most paints fade uglier every year but that blue is as ugly as it can be to begin with , so it 's bound to fade prettier ."
And the roof is shingled and painted all right .
Folks will be able to sit in the hall after this without being leaked on .
You 've accomplished so much anyhow . ''
"`` But Avonlea 's blue hall will be a byword in all the neighboring settlements from this time out , '' said Anne bitterly ."
And it must be confessed that it was .
"X Davy in Search of a Sensation Anne , walking home from school through the Birch Path one November afternoon , felt convinced afresh that life was a very wonderful thing ."
The day had been a good day ; all had gone well in her little kingdom .
St. Clair Donnell had not fought any of the other boys over the question of his name ; Prillie Rogerson 's face had been so puffed up from the effects of toothache that she did not once try to coquette with the boys in her vicinity .
Barbara Shaw had met with only ONE accident ... spilling a dipper of water over the floor ... and Anthony Pye had not been in school at all .
`` What a nice month this November has been ! ''
"said Anne , who had never quite got over her childish habit of talking to herself ."
`` November is usually such a disagreeable month ... as if the year had suddenly found out that she was growing old and could do nothing but weep and fret over it .
This year is growing old gracefully ... just like a stately old lady who knows she can be charming even with gray hair and wrinkles .
We 've had lovely days and delicious twilights .
"This last fortnight has been so peaceful , and even Davy has been almost well-behaved ."
I really think he is improving a great deal .
How quiet the woods are today ... not a murmur except that soft wind purring in the treetops !
It sounds like surf on a faraway shore .
How dear the woods are !
You beautiful trees !
I love every one of you as a friend . ''
Anne paused to throw her arm about a slim young birch and kiss its cream-white trunk .
"Diana , rounding a curve in the path , saw her and laughed ."
"`` Anne Shirley , you 're only pretending to be grown up ."
I believe when you 're alone you 're as much a little girl as you ever were . ''
"`` Well , one ca n't get over the habit of being a little girl all at once , '' said Anne gaily ."
"Well , four years ago his wife disappeared -- it was n't known how or when ."
"She just was n't ever seen again , that 's all ."
Whether she died or was murdered or went away nobody ever knew .
There was some talk of an investigation but nothing came of it .
"As for the girl , she 's always lived there with her father ."
She must be a perfect heathen .
"He never goes anywhere , but there used to be talk of strangers visiting him -- queer sort of characters who came up the lake in vessels from the American side ."
"I have n't heard any reports of such these past few years , though -- not since his wife disappeared ."
He keeps a yacht and goes sailing in it -- sometimes he cruises about for weeks -- that 's about all he ever does .
"And now you know as much about the Olivers as I do , Mr. Douglas . ''"
Alan had listened to this gossipy narrative with an interest that did not escape Isabel King 's observant eyes .
"Much of it he mentally dismissed as improbable surmise , but the basic facts were probably as Mrs. Danby had reported them ."
"He had known that the girl of the shore could be no commonplace , primly nurtured young woman ."
`` Has no effort ever been made to bring these people into touch with the church ? ''
he asked absently .
"`` Bless you , yes ."
Every minister that 's ever been in Rexton has had a try at it .
The old cousin met every one of them at the door and told him nobody was at home .
Mr. Strong was the most persistent -- he did n't like being beaten .
"He went again and again and finally the Captain sent him word that when he wanted parsons or pill-dosers he 'd send for them , and till he did he 'd thank them to mind their own business ."
"They say Mr. Strong met Lynde once along shore and wanted to know if she would n't come to church , and she laughed in his face and told him she knew more about God now than he did or ever would ."
Perhaps the story is n't true .
Or if it was maybe he provoked her into saying it .
Mr. Strong was n't overly tactful .
"I believe in judging the poor girl as charitably as possible and making allowances for her , seeing how she 's been brought up ."
You could n't expect her to know how to behave . ''
"Somehow , Alan resented Mrs. Danby 's charity ."
"Then , his sense of humour being strongly developed , he smiled to think of this commonplace old lady `` making allowances '' for the splendid bit of femininity he had seen on the shore ."
A plump barnyard fowl might as well have talked of making allowances for a seagull !
"Alan walked home with Isabel King but he was very silent as they went together down the long , dark , sweet-smelling country road bordered by its white orchards ."
"Isabel put her own construction on his absent replies to her remarks and presently she asked him , `` Did you think Lynde Oliver handsome ? ''"
The question gave Alan an annoyance out of all proportion to its significance .
But this was different .
Perhaps she needed the advice or assistance only he could give .
"To whom else in Bayside could she turn for it but to him , her old friend ?"
Was it possible that she must leave Pinehurst ?
The thought struck cold dismay to his soul .
How could he bear his life if she went away ?
He had loved Sara Stuart from childhood .
"He remembered vividly the day he had first seen her -- a spring day , much like this one had been ; he , a boy of eight , had gone with his father to the big , sunshiny hill field and he had searched for birds ' nests in the little fir copses along the crest while his father plowed ."
"He had so come upon her , sitting on the fence under the pines at the back of Pinehurst -- a child of six in a dress of purple cloth ."
"Her long , light brown curls fell over her shoulders and rippled sleekly back from her calm little brow ; her eyes were large and greyish blue , straight-gazing and steadfast ."
To the end of his life the boy was to carry in his heart the picture she made there under the pines .
"`` Little boy , '' she had said , with a friendly smile , `` will you show me where the mayflowers grow ? ''"
"Shyly enough he had assented , and they set out together for the barrens beyond the field , where the arbutus trailed its stars of sweetness under the dusty dead grasses and withered leaves of the old year ."
The boy was thrilled with delight .
She was a fairy queen who thus graciously smiled on him and chattered blithely as they searched for mayflowers in the fresh spring sunshine .
He thought it a wonderful thing that it had so chanced .
"It overjoyed him to give the choicest dusters he found into her slim , waxen little fingers , and watch her eyes grow round with pleasure in them ."
"When the sun began to lower over the beeches she had gone home with her arms full of arbutus , but she had turned at the edge of the pineland and waved her hand at him ."
"That night , when he told his mother of the little girl he had met on the hill , she had hoped anxiously that he had been `` very polite , '' for the little girl was a daughter of Colonel Stuart , newly come to Pinehurst ."
"Jeffrey , reflecting , had not been certain that he had been polite ; `` But I am sure she liked me , '' he said gravely ."
A few days later a message came from Mrs. Stuart on the hill to Mrs. Miller in the valley .
Would she let her little boy go up now and then to play with Sara ?
Sara was very lonely because she had no playmates .
"So Jeff , overjoyed , had gone to his divinity 's very home , where the two children played together many a day ."
All through their childhood they had been fast friends .
Sara 's parents placed no bar to their intimacy .
They had soon concluded that little Jeff Miller was a very good playmate for Sara .
"He was gentle , well-behaved , and manly ."
Sara never went to the district school which Jeff attended ; she had her governess at home .
"With no other boy or girl in Bayside did she form any friendship , but her loyalty to Jeff never wavered ."
"As for Jeff , he worshipped her and would have done anything she commanded ."
He belonged to her from the day they had hunted arbutus on the hill .
"Do ye gang easier so , Davie ? ''"
"`` Ay , '' said I , `` I can be doing this way ; '' and I pressed his arm with my hand ."
Again he came near sobbing .
"`` Davie , '' said he , `` I 'm no a right man at all ; I have neither sense nor kindness ; I could nae remember ye were just a bairn , I couldnae see ye were dying on your feet ; Davie , ye 'll have to try and forgive me . ''"
"`` O man , let 's say no more about it ! ''"
said I. `` We 're neither one of us to mend the other -- that 's the truth !
"We must just bear and forbear , man Alan ."
"O , but my stitch is sore !"
Is there nae house ? ''
"`` I 'll find a house to ye , David , '' he said , stoutly ."
"`` We 'll follow down the burn , where there 's bound to be houses ."
"My poor man , will ye no be better on my back ? ''"
"`` O , Alan , '' says I , `` and me a good twelve inches taller ? ''"
"`` Ye 're no such a thing , '' cried Alan , with a start ."
"`` There may be a trifling matter of an inch or two ; I 'm no saying I 'm just exactly what ye would call a tall man , whatever ; and I dare say , '' he added , his voice tailing off in a laughable manner , `` now when I come to think of it , I dare say ye 'll be just about right ."
"Ay , it 'll be a foot , or near hand ; or may be even mair ! ''"
It was sweet and laughable to hear Alan eat his words up in the fear of some fresh quarrel .
"I could have laughed , had not my stitch caught me so hard ; but if I had laughed , I think I must have wept too ."
"`` Alan , '' cried I , `` what makes ye so good to me ?"
What makes ye care for such a thankless fellow ? '' ''
"` Deed , and I do n't know '' said Alan ."
"`` For just precisely what I thought I liked about ye , was that ye never quarrelled : -- and now I like ye better ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXV IN BALQUHIDDER At the door of the first house we came to , Alan knocked , which was of no very safe enterprise in such a part of the Highlands as the Braes of Balquhidder ."
"No great clan held rule there ; it was filled and disputed by small septs , and broken remnants , and what they call `` chiefless folk , '' driven into the wild country about the springs of Forth and Teith by the advance of the Campbells ."
"Here were Stewarts and Maclarens , which came to the same thing , for the Maclarens followed Alan 's chief in war , and made but one clan with Appin ."
"Here , too , were many of that old , proscribed , nameless , red-handed clan of the Macgregors ."
"They had always been ill-considered , and now worse than ever , having credit with no side or party in the whole country of Scotland ."
"Their chief , Macgregor of Macgregor , was in exile ; the more immediate leader of that part of them about Balquhidder , James More , Rob Roy 's eldest son , lay waiting his trial in Edinburgh Castle ; they were in ill-blood with Highlander and Lowlander , with the Grahames , the Maclarens , and the Stewarts ; and Alan , who took up the quarrel of any friend , however distant , was extremely wishful to avoid them ."
"Chance served us very well ; for it was a household of Maclarens that we found , where Alan was not only welcome for his name 's sake but known by reputation ."
"Here then I was got to bed without delay , and a doctor fetched , who found me in a sorry plight ."
"But whether because he was a very good doctor , or I a very young , strong man , I lay bedridden for no more than a week , and before a month I was able to take the road again with a good heart ."
"All this time Alan would not leave me though I often pressed him , and indeed his foolhardiness in staying was a common subject of outcry with the two or three friends that were let into the secret ."
"Both were glad to get out of sight , and dropped upon the steps red , rumpled , and breathless , after the late exciting scene ."
"Gus generously forebore to speak , though he felt that he was the least to blame ; and Frank , after eating a bit of snow to moisten his dry lips , said , handsomely , -- `` Now , do n't you worry , old man ."
"I 'll pay the damages , for it was my fault ."
"Joe will dodge , but I wo n't , so make your mind easy ."
"`` We sha 'n' t hear the last of this in a hurry , '' responded Gus , relieved , yet anxious , as he thought of the reprimand his father would give him ."
`` I hope mother wo n't hear of it till I tell her quietly myself .
"She will be so frightened , and think I 'm surely smashed up , if she is told in a hurry ; '' and Frank gave a shiver , as all the danger he had run came over him suddenly ."
`` I thought we were done for when we saw that train .
Guess we should have been if you had not had your wits about you .
"I always said you were a cool one ; '' and Gus patted Frank 's back with a look of great admiration , for , now that it was all over , he considered it a very remarkable performance ."
"`` Which do you suppose it will be , fine or imprisonment ? ''"
"asked Frank , after sitting in a despondent attitude for a moment ."
`` Should n't wonder if it was both .
"Running off with an engine is no joke , you know . ''"
`` What did possess me to be such a fool ? ''
"groaned Frank , repenting , all too late , of yielding to the temptation which assailed him ."
"`` Bear up , old fellow , I 'll stand by you ; and if the worst comes , I 'll call as often as the rules of the prison allow , '' said Gus , consolingly , as he gave his afflicted friend an arm , and they walked away , both feeling that they were marked men from that day forth ."
"Meantime , Joe , as soon as he recovered from the shock of seeing the boys actually go off , ran away , as fast as his legs could carry him , to prepare Mrs. Minot for the loss of her son ; for the idea of their coming safely back never occurred to him , his knowledge of engines being limited ."
"A loud ring at the bell brought Mrs. Pecq , who was guarding the house , while Mrs. Minot entertained a parlor full of company ."
"`` Frank 's run off with No. 11 , and he 'll be killed sure ."
"Thought I 'd come up and tell you , '' stammered Joe , all out of breath and looking wild ."
"He got no further , for Mrs. Pecq clapped one hand over his mouth , caught him by the collar with the other , and hustled him into the ante-room before any one else could hear the bad news ."
"`` Tell me all about it , and do n't shout ."
What 's come to the boy ? ''
"she demanded , in a tone that reduced Joe to a whisper at once ."
"`` Go right back and see what has happened to him , then come and tell me quietly ."
I 'll wait for you here .
"I would n't have his mother startled for the world , '' said the good soul , when she knew all ."
"`` Oh , I dar ` s n't !"
"I opened the switch as they told me to , and Bill will half kill me when he knows it ! ''"
"cried Joe , in a panic , as the awful consequences of his deed rose before him , showing both boys mortally injured and several trains wrecked ."
`` Then take yourself off home and hold your tongue .
Rilla felt Carl 's going keenly .
They had always been cronies and playmates .
He was only a little older than she was and they had been children in Rainbow Valley together .
She recalled all their old pranks and escapades as she walked slowly home alone .
"The full moon peeped through the scudding clouds with sudden floods of weird illumination , the telephone wires sang a shrill weird song in the wind , and the tall spikes of withered , grey-headed golden-rod in the fence corners swayed and beckoned wildly to her like groups of old witches weaving unholy spells ."
"On such a night as this , long ago , Carl would come over to Ingleside and whistle her out to the gate ."
"`` Let 's go on a moon-spree , Rilla , '' he would say , and the two of them would scamper off to Rainbow Valley ."
"Rilla had never been afraid of his beetles and bugs , though she drew a hard and fast line at snakes ."
"They used to talk together of almost everything and were teased about each other at school ; but one evening when they were about ten years of age they had solemnly promised , by the old spring in Rainbow Valley , that they would never marry each other ."
"Alice Clow had `` crossed out '' their names on her slate in school that day , and it came out that `` both married . ''"
"They did not like the idea at all , hence the mutual vow in Rainbow Valley ."
There was nothing like an ounce of prevention .
Rilla laughed over the old memory -- and then sighed .
That very day a dispatch from some London paper had contained the cheerful announcement that `` the present moment is the darkest since the war began . ''
"It was dark enough , and Rilla wished desperately that she could do something besides waiting and serving at home , as day after day the Glen boys she had known went away ."
"If she were only a boy , speeding in khaki by Carl 's side to the Western front !"
"She had wished that in a burst of romance when Jem had gone , without , perhaps , really meaning it ."
She meant it now .
"There were moments when waiting at home , in safety and comfort , seemed an unendurable thing ."
The moon burst triumphantly through an especially dark cloud and shadow and silver chased each other in waves over the Glen .
"Rilla remembered one moonlit evening of childhood when she had said to her mother , `` The moon just looks like a sorry , sorry face . ''"
"She thought it looked like that still -- an agonised , care-worn face , as though it looked down on dreadful sights ."
What did it see on the Western front ?
In broken Serbia ?
On shell-swept Gallipoli ?
"`` I am tired , '' Miss Oliver had said that day , in a rare outburst of impatience , `` of this horrible rack of strained emotions , when every day brings a new horror or the dread of it ."
"No , do n't look reproachfully at me , Mrs. Blythe ."
There 's nothing heroic about me today .
I 've slumped .
I wish England had left Belgium to her fate -- I wish Canada had never sent a man -- I wish we 'd tied our boys to our apron strings and not let one of them go .
Oh -- I shall be ashamed of myself in half an hour -- but at this very minute I mean every word of it .
Will the Allies never strike ? ''
"Then the dirty-handed society went off the wash , followed by the Professor , trying to calm the anxiety of Rob , who had been told by Tommy that all water was full of invisible pollywogs ."
"`` I like your plan very much , only do n't be too generous , Teddy , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , when they were left alone ."
"`` You know most of the boys have got to paddle their own canoes when they leave us , and too much sitting in the lap of luxury will unfit them for it . ''"
"`` I 'll be moderate , but do let me amuse myself ."
"I get desperately tired of business sometimes , and nothing freshens me up like a good frolic with your boys ."
"I like that Dan very much , Jo ."
"He is n't demonstrative ; but he has the eye of a hawk , and when you have tamed him a little he will do you credit . ''"
`` I 'm so glad you think so .
"Thank you very much for your kindness to him , especially for this museum affair ; it will keep him happy while he is lame , give me a chance to soften and smooth this poor , rough lad , and make him love us ."
"What did inspire you with such a beautiful , helpful idea , Teddy ? ''"
"asked Mrs. Bhaer , glancing back at the pleasant room , as she turned to leave it ."
"Laurie took both her hands in his , and answered , with a look that made her eyes fill with happy tears , `` Dear Jo !"
"I have known what it is to be a motherless boy , and I never can forget how much you and yours have done for me all these years . ''"
CHAPTER XII .
"HUCKLEBERRIES There was a great clashing of tin pails , much running to and fro , and frequent demands for something to eat , one August afternoon , for the boys were going huckleberrying , and made as much stir about it as if they were setting out to find the North West Passage ."
"`` Now , my lads , get off as quietly as you can , for Rob is safely out of the way , and wo n't see you , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , as she tied Daisy 's broad-brimmed hat , and settled the great blue pinafore in which she had enveloped Nan ."
"But the plan did not succeed , for Rob had heard the bustle , decided to go , and prepared himself , without a thought of disappointment ."
"The troop was just getting under way when the little man came marching downstairs with his best hat on , a bright tin pail in his hand , and a face beaming with satisfaction ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"now we shall have a scene , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer , who found her eldest son very hard to manage at times ."
"`` I 'm all ready , '' said Rob , and took his place in the ranks with such perfect unconsciousness of his mistake , that it really was very hard to undeceive him ."
"`` It 's too far for you , my love ; stay and take care of me , for I shall be all alone , '' began his mother ."
`` You 've got Teddy .
"I 'm a big boy , so I can go ; you said I might when I was bigger , and I am now , '' persisted Rob , with a cloud beginning to dim the brightness of his happy face ."
"`` We are going up to the great pasture , and it 's ever so far ; we do n't want you tagging on , '' cried Jack , who did not admire the little boys ."
"`` I wo n't tag , I 'll run and keep up ."
O Mamma !
let me go !
"I want to fill my new pail , and I 'll bring 'em all to you ."
"Please , please , I will be good ! ''"
"prayed Robby , looking up at his mother , so grieved and disappointed that her heart began to fail her ."
"`` But , my deary , you 'll get so tired and hot you wo n't have a good time ."
"cried Frank , relenting ."
"`` Now , Jack , make their minds easy before they begin to weep and wail . ''"
`` Left the box outside .
"You tell while I go for it ; '' and Jack bolted , as if afraid the young ladies might be too demonstrative when the tale was told ."
"`` Tell away , '' said Frank , modestly passing the story along to Gus , who made short work of it ."
"`` We rampaged all over the country , and got only that small mess of greens ."
"Knew you 'd be disgusted , and sat down to see what we could do ."
"Then Jack piped up , and said he 'd show us a place where we could get a plenty ."
"` Come on , ' said we , and after leading us a nice tramp , he brought us out at Morse 's greenhouse ."
"So we got a few on tick , as we had but four cents among us , and there you are ."
"Pretty clever of the little chap , was n't it ? ''"
"A chorus of delight greeted Jack as he popped his head in , was promptly seized by his elders and walked up to the table , where the box was opened , displaying gay posies enough to fill most of the baskets if distributed with great economy and much green ."
`` You are the dearest boy that ever was ! ''
"began Jill , with her nose luxuriously buried in the box , though the flowers were more remarkable for color than perfume ."
"`` No , I 'm not ; there 's a much dearer one coming upstairs now , and he 's got something that will make you howl for joy , '' said Jack , ignoring his own prowess as Ed came in with a bigger box , looking as if he had done nothing but go a Maying all his days ."
`` Do n't believe it ! ''
"cried Jill , hugging her own treasure jealously ."
`` It 's only another joke .
"I wo n't look , '' said Molly , still struggling to make her cambric roses bloom again ."
`` I know what it is !
"Oh , how sweet ! ''"
"added Merry , sniffing , as Ed set the box before her , saying pleasantly , -- `` You shall see first , because you had faith . ''"
"Up went the cover , and a whiff of the freshest fragrance regaled the seven eager noses bent to inhale it , as a general murmur of pleasure greeted the nest of great , rosy mayflowers that lay before them ."
"`` The dear things , how lovely they are ! ''"
"and Merry looked as if greeting her cousins , so blooming and sweet was her own face ."
"Molly pushed her dingy garlands away , ashamed of such poor attempts beside these perfect works of nature , and Jill stretched out her hand involuntarily , as she said , forgetting her exotics , `` Give me just one to smell of , it is so woodsy and delicious . ''"
"`` Here you are , plenty for all ."
"Real Pilgrim Fathers , right from Plymouth ."
"One of our fellows lives there , and I told him to bring me a good lot ; so he did , and you can do what you like with them , '' explained Ed , passing round bunches and shaking the rest in a mossy pile upon the table ."
`` Ed always gets ahead of us in doing the right thing at the right time .
"Hope you 've got some first-class baskets ready for him , '' said Gus , refreshing the Washingtonian nose with a pink blossom or two ."
"`` Not much danger of his being forgotten , '' answered Molly ; and every one laughed , for Ed was much beloved by all the girls , and his door-steps always bloomed like a flower-bed on May eve ."
"About a mile from Kettley , Dick came to one such break in the plain line of causeway , where the reeds and willows grew dispersedly like little islands and confused the eye ."
"The gap , besides , was more than usually long ; it was a place where any stranger might come readily to mischief ; and Dick bethought him , with something like a pang , of the lad whom he had so imperfectly directed ."
"As for himself , one look backward to where the windmill sails were turning black against the blue of heaven -- one look forward to the high ground of Tunstall Forest , and he was sufficiently directed and held straight on , the water washing to his horse 's knees , as safe as on a highway ."
"Half-way across , and when he had already sighted the path rising high and dry upon the farther side , he was aware of a great splashing on his right , and saw a grey horse , sunk to its belly in the mud , and still spasmodically struggling ."
"Instantly , as though it had divined the neighbourhood of help , the poor beast began to neigh most piercingly ."
"It rolled , meanwhile , a blood-shot eye , insane with terror ; and as it sprawled wallowing in the quag , clouds of stinging insects rose and buzzed about it in the air ."
`` Alack ! ''
"thought Dick , `` can the poor lad have perished ?"
"There is his horse , for certain -- a brave grey !"
"Nay , comrade , if thou criest to me so piteously , I will do all man can to help thee ."
Shalt not lie there to drown by inches ! ''
"And he made ready his crossbow , and put a quarrel through the creature 's head ."
"Dick rode on after this act of rugged mercy , somewhat sobered in spirit , and looking closely about him for any sign of his less happy predecessor in the way ."
"`` I would I had dared to tell him further , '' he thought ; `` for I fear he has miscarried in the slough . ''"
"And just as he was so thinking , a voice cried upon his name from the causeway side , and , looking over his shoulder , he saw the lad 's face peering from a clump of reeds ."
`` Are ye there ? ''
"he said , reining in ."
`` Ye lay so close among the reeds that I had passed you by .
"I saw your horse bemired , and put him from his agony ; which , by my sooth !"
"an ye had been a more merciful rider , ye had done yourself ."
But come forth out of your hiding .
Here be none to trouble you . ''
"`` Nay , good boy , I have no arms , nor skill to use them if I had , '' replied the other , stepping forth upon the pathway ."
`` Why call me ` boy ' ? ''
cried Dick .
"`` Y ' are not , I trow , the elder of us twain . ''"
"`` Good Master Shelton , '' said the other , `` prithee forgive me ."
I have none the least intention to offend .
"Rather I would in every way beseech your gentleness and favour , for I am now worse bested than ever , having lost my way , my cloak , and my poor horse ."
"To have a riding-rod and spurs , and never a horse to sit upon !"
"And before all , '' he added , looking ruefully upon his clothes -- `` before all , to be so sorrily besmirched ! ''"
`` Tut ! ''
"It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation ; some time that night , or at latest before noon of the morrow , we should sight the Treasure Island ."
We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea .
"The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily , dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray ."
All was drawing alow and aloft ; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure .
"Now , just after sundown , when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth , it occurred to me that I should like an apple ."
I ran on deck .
The watch was all forward looking out for the island .
"The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself , and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship ."
"In I got bodily into the apple barrel , and found there was scarce an apple left ; but sitting down there in the dark , what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship , I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by ."
"The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it , and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak ."
"It was Silver 's voice , and before I had heard a dozen words , I would not have shown myself for all the world , but lay there , trembling and listening , in the extreme of fear and curiosity , for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone ."
"11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel `` NO , not I , '' said Silver ."
"`` Flint was cap'n ; I was quartermaster , along of my timber leg ."
"The same broadside I lost my leg , old Pew lost his deadlights ."
"It was a master surgeon , him that ampytated me -- out of college and all -- Latin by the bucket , and what not ; but he was hanged like a dog , and sun-dried like the rest , at Corso Castle ."
"That was Roberts ' men , that was , and comed of changing names to their ships -- ROYAL FORTUNE and so on ."
"Now , what a ship was christened , so let her stay , I says ."
"So it was with the CASSANDRA , as brought us all safe home from Malabar , after England took the viceroy of the Indies ; so it was with the old WALRUS , Flint 's old ship , as I 've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"cried another voice , that of the youngest hand on board , and evidently full of admiration ."
"`` He was the flower of the flock , was Flint ! ''"
"`` Davis was a man too , by all accounts , '' said Silver ."
"`` I never sailed along of him ; first with England , then with Flint , that 's my story ; and now here on my own account , in a manner of speaking ."
"I laid by nine hundred safe , from England , and two thousand after Flint ."
That ai n't bad for a man before the mast -- all safe in bank .
"` Tai n't earning now , it 's saving does it , you may lay to that ."
Where 's all England 's men now ?
I dunno .
Where 's Flint 's ?
"Why , most on 'em aboard here , and glad to get the duff -- been begging before that , some on 'em ."
"Old Pew , as had lost his sight , and might have thought shame , spends twelve hundred pound in a year , like a lord in Parliament ."
Where is he now ?
"Three days and three nights they swam through the sea , and at length Uraschimataro arrived at the beach which lay before his old home ."
"The turtle bade him farewell , and was gone in a moment ."
Uraschimataro drew near to the village with quick and joyful steps .
"He saw the smoke curling through the roof , and the thatch where green plants had thickly sprouted ."
"He heard the children shouting and calling , and from a window that he passed came the twang of the koto , and everything seemed to cry a welcome for his return ."
Yet suddenly he felt a pang at his heart as he wandered down the street .
"After all , everything was changed ."
Neither men nor houses were those he once knew .
"Quickly he saw his old home ; yes , it was still there , but it had a strange look ."
"Anxiously he knocked at the door , and asked the woman who opened it after his parents ."
"But she did not know their names , and could give him no news of them ."
"Still more disturbed , he rushed to the burying ground , the only place that could tell him what he wished to know ."
Here at any rate he would find out what it all meant .
And he was right .
"In a moment he stood before the grave of his parents , and the date written on the stone was almost exactly the date when they had lost their son , and he had forsaken them for the Daughter of the Sea ."
"And so he found that since he had deft his home , three hundred years had passed by ."
"Shuddering with horror at his discovery he turned back into the village street , hoping to meet some one who could tell him of the days of old ."
"But when the man spoke , he knew he was not dreaming , though he felt as if he had lost his senses ."
In despair he bethought him of the box which was the gift of the princess .
Perhaps after all this dreadful thing was not true .
"He might be the victim of some enchanter 's spell , and in his hand lay the counter-charm ."
"Almost unconsciously he opened it , and a purple vapour came pouring out ."
"He held the empty box in his hand , and as he looked he saw that the fresh hand of youth had grown suddenly shrivelled , like the hand of an old , old man ."
"He ran to the brook , which flowed in a clear stream down from the mountain ."
and saw himself reflected as in a mirror .
It was the face of a mummy which looked back at him .
"Wounded to death , he crept back through the village , and no man knew the old , old man to be the strong handsome youth who had run down the street an hour before ."
"So he toiled wearily back , till he reached the shore , and here he sat sadly on a rock , and called loudly on the turtle ."
"But she never came back any more , but instead , death came soon , and set him free ."
"But before that happened , the people who saw him sitting lonely on the shore had heard his story , and when their children were restless they used to tell them of the good son who from love to his parents had given up for their sakes the splendour and wonders of the palace in the sea , and the most beautiful woman in the world besides ."
The Slaying of the Tanuki From the Japanische Murchen und Sagen .
"Near a big river , and between two high mountains , a man and his wife lived in a cottage a long , long time ago ."
Mr. Pryor 's once ruddy face was ashen .
But he turned at bay .
"`` I 'll have the law on you for this , '' he gasped ."
"`` Do -- do , '' roared Norman , making another rush ."
But Mr. Pryor was gone .
He had no desire to fall a second time into the hands of an avenging militarist .
"Norman turned to the platform for one graceless , triumphant moment ."
"`` Do n't look so flabbergasted , parsons , '' he boomed ."
`` You could n't do it -- nobody would expect it of the cloth -- but somebody had to do it .
You know you 're glad I threw him out -- he could n't be let go on yammering and yodelling and yawping sedition and treason .
Sedition and treason -- somebody had to deal with it .
I was born for this hour -- I 've had my innings in church at last .
I can sit quiet for another sixty years now !
"Go ahead with your meeting , parsons ."
I reckon you wo n't be troubled with any more pacifist prayers . ''
But the spirit of devotion and reverence had fled .
Both ministers realized it and realized that the only thing to do was to close the meeting quietly and let the excited people go .
"Mr. Meredith addressed a few earnest words to the boys in khaki -- which probably saved Mr. Pryor 's windows from a second onslaught -- and Mr. Arnold pronounced an incongruous benediction , at least he felt it was incongruous , for he could not at once banish from his memory the sight of gigantic Norman Douglas shaking the fat , pompous little Whiskers-on-the-moon as a huge mastiff might shake an overgrown puppy ."
And he knew that the same picture was in everybody 's mind .
Altogether the union prayer-meeting could hardly be called an unqualified success .
But it was remembered in Glen St. Mary when scores of orthodox and undisturbed assemblies were totally forgotten .
"`` You will never , no , never , Mrs. Dr. dear , hear me call Norman Douglas a pagan again , '' said Susan when she reached home ."
`` If Ellen Douglas is not a proud woman this night she should be . ''
"`` Norman Douglas did a wholly indefensible thing , '' said the doctor ."
`` Pryor should have been let severely alone until the meeting was over .
"Then later on , his own minister and session should deal with him ."
That would have been the proper procedure .
"Norman 's performance was utterly improper and scandalous and outrageous ; but , by George , '' -- the doctor threw back his head and chuckled , `` by George , Anne-girl , it was satisfying . ''"
"CHAPTER XXI `` LOVE AFFAIRS ARE HORRIBLE '' Ingleside 20th June 1916 `` We have been so busy , and day after day has brought such exciting news , good and bad , that I have n't had time and composure to write in my diary for weeks ."
"I like to keep it up regularly , for father says a diary of the years of the war should be a very interesting thing to hand down to one 's children ."
"The trouble is , I like to write a few personal things in this blessed old book that might not be exactly what I 'd want my children to read ."
I feel that I shall be a far greater stickler for propriety in regard to them than I am for myself !
"Now , alas !"
it was absolutely finished .
"Oh , dear no !"
` Gracious me ! '
"cried a brass manufacturer , ` there 's no handle on the door , ' and he put one on ."
"An ironmonger added a scraper , and an old lady ran up with a door-mat ."
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
` Finished !
"how can it be finished , ' the plumber demanded scornfully , ` before hot and cold are put in ? '"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower-garden to the right of the verandah , and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Shook his bald head and murmured , ` Cold , quite cold ' -RSB- Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished , and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , ` Tony , ' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"As Tony made no answer , she sat up , whereupon her head hit the roof , and it opened like the lid of a box , and to her bewilderment she saw all around her the Kensington Gardens lying deep in snow ."
"As she was not in the nursery she wondered whether this was really herself , so she pinched her cheeks , and then she knew it was herself , and this reminded her that she was in the middle of a great adventure ."
"She remembered now everything that had happened to her from the closing of the gates up to her running away from the fairies , but how ever , she asked herself , had she got into this funny place ?"
"She stepped out by the roof , right over the garden , and then she saw the dear house in which she had passed the night ."
It so entranced her that she could think of nothing else . '
O you darling !
O you sweet !
O you love ! '
she cried .
"Perhaps a human voice frightened the little house , or maybe it now knew that its work was done , for no sooner had Maimie spoken than it began to grow smaller ; it shrank so slowly that she could scarce believe it was shrinking , yet she soon knew that it could not contain her now ."
"It always remained as complete as ever , but it became smaller and smaller , and the garden dwindled at the same time , and the snow crept closer , lapping house and garden up ."
"Now the house was the size of a little dog 's kennel , and now of a Noah 's Ark , but still you could see the smoke and the door-handle and the roses on the wall , every one complete ."
"The glow-worm light was waning too , but it was still there ."
"` Darling , loveliest , do n't go ! '"
"You could gather from his talk that he was a very brave boy , and no one was so proud of it as Maimie ."
She would have loved to have a ticket on her saying that she was his sister .
"And at no time did she admire him more than when he told her , as he often did with splendid firmness , that one day he meant to remain behind in the Gardens after the gates were closed ."
"`` Oh , Tony , '' she would say , with awful respect , `` but the fairies will be so angry ! ''"
"`` I daresay , '' replied Tony , carelessly ."
"`` Perhaps , '' she said , thrilling , `` Peter Pan will give you a sail in his boat ! ''"
"`` I shall make him , '' replied Tony ; no wonder she was proud of him ."
"But they should not have talked so loudly , for one day they were overheard by a fairy who had been gathering skeleton leaves , from which the little people weave their summer curtains , and after that Tony was a marked boy ."
"They loosened the rails before he sat on them , so that down he came on the back of his head ; they tripped him up by catching his bootlace and bribed the ducks to sink his boat ."
"Nearly all the nasty accidents you meet with in the Gardens occur because the fairies have taken an ill-will to you , and so it behoves you to be careful what you say about them ."
"Maimie was one of the kind who like to fix a day for doing things , but Tony was not that kind , and when she asked him which day he was to remain behind in the Gardens after Lock-out he merely replied , `` Just some day ; '' he was quite vague about which day except when she asked `` Will it be today ? ''"
and then he could always say for certain that it would not be to-day .
So she saw that he was waiting for a real good chance .
"This brings us to an afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow , and there was ice on the Round Pond , not thick enough to skate on but at least you could spoil it for tomorrow by flinging stones , and many bright little boys and girls were doing that ."
"When Tony and his sister arrived they wanted to go straight to the pond , but their ayah said they must take a sharp walk first , and as she said this she glanced at the time-board to see when the Gardens closed that night ."
It read half-past five .
Poor ayah !
"she is the one who laughs continuously because there are so many white children in the world , but she was not to laugh much more that day ."
"Well , they went up the Baby Walk and back , and when they returned to the time-board she was surprised to see that it now read five o'clock for closing time ."
"But she was unacquainted with the tricky ways of the fairies , and so did not see -LRB- as Maimie and Tony saw at once -RRB- that they had changed the hour because there was to be a ball to-night ."
"She said there was only time now to walk to the top of the Hump and back , and as they trotted along with her she little guessed what was thrilling their little breasts ."
You see the chance had come of seeing a fairy ball .
"Never , Tony felt , could he hope for a better chance ."
"He had to feel this , for Maimie so plainly felt it for him ."
"Her eager eyes asked the question , `` Is it to-day ? ''"
and he gasped and then nodded .
"Maimie slipped her hand into Tony 's , and hers was hot , but his was cold ."
She did a very kind thing ; she took off her scarf and gave it to him !
"`` In case you should feel cold , '' she whispered ."
"Her face was aglow , but Tony 's was very gloomy ."
"As they turned on the top of the Hump he whispered to her , `` I 'm afraid Nurse would see me , so I sha 'n' t be able to do it . ''"
"Maimie admired him more than ever for being afraid of nothing but their ayah , when there were so many unknown terrors to fear , and she said aloud , `` Tony , I shall race you to the gate , '' and in a whisper , `` Then you can hide , '' and off they ran ."
"One , tailing out behind the rest , was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey 's ; the rest were revenue officers , whom he had met by the way , and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once ."
"Some news of the lugger in Kitt 's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction , and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death ."
"Pew was dead , stone dead ."
"As for my mother , when we had carried her up to the hamlet , a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again , and she was none the worse for her terror , though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money ."
"In the meantime the supervisor rode on , as fast as he could , to Kitt 's Hole ; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle , leading , and sometimes supporting , their horses , and in continual fear of ambushes ; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way , though still close in ."
He hailed her .
"A voice replied , telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him , and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm ."
"Soon after , the lugger doubled the point and disappeared ."
"Mr. Dance stood there , as he said , `` like a fish out of water , '' and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B -- to warn the cutter ."
"`` And that , '' said he , `` is just about as good as nothing ."
"They 've got off clean , and there 's an end ."
"Only , '' he added , `` I 'm glad I trod on Master Pew 's corns , '' for by this time he had heard my story ."
"I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow , and you can not imagine a house in such a state of smash ; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself ; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain 's money-bag and a little silver from the till , I could see at once that we were ruined ."
Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene .
"`` They got the money , you say ?"
"Well , then , Hawkins , what in fortune were they after ?"
"More money , I suppose ? ''"
"`` No , sir ; not money , I think , '' replied I. `` In fact , sir , I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket ; and to tell you the truth , I should like to get it put in safety . ''"
"`` To be sure , boy ; quite right , '' said he ."
"`` I 'll take it , if you like . ''"
`` I thought perhaps Dr. Livesey -- '' I began .
"`` Perfectly right , '' he interrupted very cheerily , `` perfectly right -- a gentleman and a magistrate ."
"And , now I come to think of it , I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire ."
"Master Pew 's dead , when all 's done ; not that I regret it , but he 's dead , you see , and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty 's revenue , if make it out they can ."
"Now , I 'll tell you , Hawkins , if you like , I 'll take you along . ''"
"I thanked him heartily for the offer , and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were ."
By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle .
"`` Dogger , '' said Mr. Dance , `` you have a good horse ; take up this lad behind you . ''"
"As soon as I was mounted , holding on to Dogger 's belt , the supervisor gave the word , and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey 's house ."
6 The Captain 's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey 's door .
The house was all dark to the front .
"Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock , and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by ."
Then pare your squash and potatoes . ''
"`` There is only one potato , '' giggled Sally ."
"`` Cut it in four pieces , so it will go into the little kettle , and put the bits into cold water till it is time to cook them . ''"
`` Do I soak the squash too ? ''
"`` No , indeed !"
"Just pare it and cut it up , and put in into the steamer over the pot ."
"It is drier so , though it takes longer to cook . ''"
"Here a scratching at the door caused Sally to run and open it , when Kit appeared with a covered basket in his mouth ."
`` Here 's the butcher boy ! ''
"cried Daisy , much tickled at the idea , as she relieved him of his load , whereat he licked his lips and began to beg , evidently thinking that it was his own dinner , for he often carried it to his master in that way ."
"Being undeceived , he departed in great wrath and barked all the way downstairs , to ease his wounded feelings ."
"In the basket were two bits of steak -LRB- doll 's pounds -RRB- , a baked pear , a small cake , and paper with them on which Asia had scrawled , `` For Missy 's lunch , if her cookin ' do n't turn out well . ''"
"`` I do n't want any of her old pears and things ; my cooking will turn out well , and I 'll have a splendid dinner ; see if I do n't ! ''"
"cried Daisy , indignantly ."
`` We may like them if company should come .
"It is always well to have something in the storeroom , '' said Aunt Jo , who had been taught this valuable fact by a series of domestic panics ."
"`` Me is hundry , '' announced Teddy , who began to think what with so much cooking going on it was about time for somebody to eat something ."
"His mother gave him her workbasket to rummage , hoping to keep him quiet till dinner was ready , and returned to her housekeeping ."
"`` Put on your vegetables , set the table , and then have some coals kindling ready for the steak . ''"
"What a thing it was to see the potatoes bobbing about in the little pot ; to peep at the squash getting soft so fast in the tiny steamer ; to whisk open the oven door every five minutes to see how the pies got on , and at last when the coals were red and glowing , to put two real steaks on a finger-long gridiron and proudly turn them with a fork ."
"The potatoes were done first , and no wonder , for they had boiled frantically all the while ."
"The were pounded up with a little pestle , had much butter and no salt put in -LRB- cook forgot it in the excitement of the moment -RRB- , then it was made into a mound in a gay red dish , smoothed over with a knife dipped in milk , and put in the oven to brown ."
"So absorbed in these last performances had Sally been , that she forgot her pastry till she opened the door to put in the potato , then a wail arose , for alas !"
alas !
the little pies were burnt black !
"`` Oh , my pies !"
My darling pies !
They are all spoilt ! ''
"cried poor Sally , wringing her dirty little hands as she surveyed the ruin of her work ."
"The tart was especially pathetic , for the quirls and zigzags stuck up in all directions from the blackened jelly , like the walls and chimney of a house after a fire ."
"`` Dear , dear , I forgot to remind you to take them out ; it 's just my luck , '' said Aunt Jo , remorsefully ."
"`` Do n't cry , darling , it was my fault ; we 'll try again after dinner , '' she added , as a great tear dropped from Sally 's eyes and sizzled on the hot ruins of the tart ."
"Jims writhed in those big , firm , capable hands of Mary -- oh yes , she is capable all right -- and choked and wheezed -- and choked and wheezed -- and I felt that he was being tortured to death -- and then all at once , after what seemed to me an hour , though it really was n't long , he coughed up the membrane that was killing him ."
Mary turned him over and laid him back on his bed .
He was white as marble and the tears were pouring out of his brown eyes -- but that awful livid look was gone from his face and he could breathe quite easily . ''
` Was n't that some trick ? '
said Mary gaily . '
"I had n't any idea how it would work , but I just took a chance ."
"I 'll smoke his throat out again once or twice before morning , just to kill all the germs , but you 'll see he 'll be all right now . '"
"`` Jims went right to sleep -- real sleep , not coma , as I feared at first ."
"Mary ` smoked him , ' as she called it , twice through the night , and at daylight his throat was perfectly clear and his temperature was almost normal ."
When I made sure of that I turned and looked at Mary Vance .
She was sitting on the lounge laying down the law to Susan on some subject about which Susan must have known forty times as much as she did .
But I did n't mind how much law she laid down or how much she bragged .
"She had a right to brag -- she had dared to do what I would never have dared , and had saved Jims from a horrible death ."
It did n't matter any more that she had once chased me through the Glen with a codfish ; it did n't matter that she had smeared goose-grease all over my dream of romance the night of the lighthouse dance ; it did n't matter that she thought she knew more than anybody else and always rubbed it in -- I would never dislike Mary Vance again .
I went over to her and kissed her . ''
` What 's up now ? '
she said . ''
"` Nothing -- only I 'm so grateful to you , Mary . ' ''"
"` Well , I think you ought to be , that 's a fact ."
"You two would have let that baby die on your hands if I had n't happened along , ' said Mary , just beaming with complacency ."
"She got Susan and me a tip-top breakfast and made us eat it , and ` bossed the life out of us , ' as Susan says , for two days , until the roads were opened so that she could get home ."
"Jims was almost well by that time , and father turned up ."
He heard our tale without saying much .
Father is rather scornful generally about what he calls ` old wives ' remedies . '
"He laughed a little and said , ` After this , Mary Vance will expect me to call her in for consultation in all my serious cases . '"
"`` So Christmas was not so hard as I expected it to be ; and now the New Year is coming -- and we are still hoping for the ` Big Push ' that will end the war -- and Little Dog Monday is getting stiff and rheumatic from his cold vigils , but still he ` carries on , ' and Shirley continues to read the exploits of the aces ."
"Oh , nineteen-seventeen , what will you bring ? ''"
"CHAPTER XXV SHIRLEY GOES `` No , Woodrow , there will be no peace without victory , '' said Susan , sticking her knitting needle viciously through President Wilson 's name in the newspaper column ."
"`` We Canadians mean to have peace and victory , too ."
"You , if it pleases you , Woodrow , can have the peace without the victory '' -- and Susan stalked off to bed with the comfortable consciousness of having got the better of the argument with the President ."
But a few days later she rushed to Mrs. Blythe in red-hot excitement .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , what do you think ?"
He may not stand alone ; 't is not in nature . ''
"`` They that have no judgment should not draw the sword , '' replied the young lady ."
"`` Ye that fight but for a hazard , what are ye but a butcher ?"
"War is but noble by the cause , and y ' have disgraced it . ''"
"`` Madam , '' said the miserable Dick , `` I do partly see mine error ."
I have made too much haste ; I have been busy before my time .
"Already I stole a ship -- thinking , I do swear it , to do well -- and thereby brought about the death of many innocent , and the grief and ruin of a poor old man whose face this very day hath stabbed me like a dagger ."
"And for this morning , I did but design to do myself credit , and get fame to marry with , and , behold !"
I have brought about the death of your dear kinsman that was good to me .
"And what besides , I know not ."
"For , alas !"
"I may have set York upon the throne , and that may be the worser cause , and may do hurt to England ."
"O , madam , I do see my sin ."
I am unfit for life .
"I will , for penance sake and to avoid worse evil , once I have finished this adventure , get me to a cloister ."
I will forswear Joanna and the trade of arms .
"I will be a friar , and pray for your good kinsman 's spirit all my days . ''"
"It appeared to Dick , in this extremity of his humiliation and repentance , that the young lady had laughed ."
"Raising his countenance , he found her looking down upon him , in the fire-light , with a somewhat peculiar but not unkind expression ."
"`` Madam , '' he cried , thinking the laughter to have been an illusion of his hearing , but still , from her changed looks , hoping to have touched her heart , `` madam , will not this content you ?"
I give up all to undo what I have done amiss ; I make heaven certain for Lord Risingham .
"And all this upon the very day that I have won my spurs , and thought myself the happiest young gentleman on ground . ''"
"`` O boy , '' she said -- `` good boy ! ''"
"And then , to the extreme surprise of Dick , she first very tenderly wiped the tears away from his cheeks , and then , as if yielding to a sudden impulse , threw both her arms about his neck , drew up his face , and kissed him ."
A pitiful bewilderment came over simple-minded Dick .
"`` But come , '' she said , with great cheerfulness , `` you that are a captain , ye must eat ."
Why sup ye not ? ''
"`` Dear Mistress Risingham , '' replied Dick , `` I did but wait first upon my prisoner ; but , to say truth , penitence will no longer suffer me to endure the sight of food ."
"I were better to fast , dear lady , and to pray . ''"
"`` Call me Alicia , '' she said ; `` are we not old friends ?"
"And now , come , I will eat with you , bit for bit and sup for sup ; so if ye eat not , neither will I ; but if ye eat hearty , I will dine like a ploughman . ''"
"So there and then she fell to ; and Dick , who had an excellent stomach , proceeded to bear her company , at first with great reluctance , but gradually , as he entered into the spirit , with more and more vigour and devotion : until , at last , he forgot even to watch his model , and most heartily repaired the expenses of his day of labour and excitement ."
"Then I was afraid Jerry would go and make a fuss , and Bob would run off , or do something desperate , being worried , and I said I 'd pay it for him , if I could ."
"So he went home pretty jolly , and I scratched ` round for the money ."
"Got it , too , and was n't I glad ? ''"
"Jack paused to rub his hands , and Frank said , with more than usual respect , `` Could n't you get hold of Jerry in any other place , and out of school time ?"
"That did the mischief , thanks to Joe ."
"I thrashed him , Jill -- did I mention it ? ''"
"`` I could n't get all my money till Friday morning , and I knew Jerry was off at night ."
"I looked for him before school , and at noon , but could n't find him , so afternoon recess was my last chance ."
"I was bound to do it and I did n't mean to break the rule , but Jerry was just going into the shop , so I pelted after him , and as it was private business we went to the billiard-room ."
"I declare I never was so relieved as when I handed over that money , and made him say it was all right , and he would n't go near Bob ."
"He 's off , so my mind is easy , and Bob will be so grateful I can keep him steady , perhaps ."
"That will be worth two seventy-five , I think , '' said Jack heartily ."
"`` You should have come to me , '' began Frank ."
"`` And got laughed at -- no , thank you , '' interrupted Jack , recollecting several philanthropic little enterprises which were nipped in the bud for want of co-operation ."
"`` To me , then , '' said his mother ."
`` It would have saved so much trouble . ''
"`` I thought of it , but Bob did n't want the big fellows to know for fear they 'd be down on him , so I thought he might not like me to tell grown people ."
"I do n't mind the fuss now , and Bob is as kind as he can be ."
"Wanted to give me his big knife , but I would n't take it ."
"I 'd rather have this , '' and Jack put the letter in his pocket with a slap outside , as if it warmed the cockles of his heart to have it there ."
"`` Well , it seems rather like a tempest in a teapot , now it is all over , but I do admire your pluck , little boy , in holding out so well when every one was scolding at you , and you in the right all the time , '' said Frank , glad to praise , now that he honestly could , after his wholesale condemnation ."
"`` That is what pulled me through , I suppose ."
"I used to think if I had done anything wrong , that I could n't stand the snubbing a day ."
"I should have told right off , and had it over ."
"Now , I guess I 'll have a good report if you do tell Mr. Acton , '' said Jack , looking at his mother so wistfully , that she resolved to slip away that very evening , and make sure that the thing was done ."
"`` That will make you happier than anything else , wo n't it ? ''"
"asked Jill , eager to have him rewarded after his trials ."
"`` There 's one thing I like better , though I 'd be very sorry to lose my report ."
"It 's the fun of telling Ed I tried to do as he wanted us to , and seeing how pleased he 'll be , '' added Jack , rather bashfully , for the boys laughed at him sometimes for his love of this friend ."
"`` I know he wo n't be any happier about it than someone else , who stood by you all through , and set her bright wits to work till the trouble was all cleared away , '' said Mrs. Minot , looking at Jill 's contented face , as she lay smiling on them all ."
"Jack understood , and , hopping across the room , gave both the thin hands a hearty shake ; then , not finding any words quite cordial enough in which to thank this faithful little sister , he stooped down and kissed her gratefully ."
Chapter XV .
"He went in a hurry in the end , because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
Oh !
"he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Wallflower juice is good for reviving dancers who fall to the ground in a fit -RSB- But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , ` Mother !"
mother ! '
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her !
"Ah , Peter !"
"we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right -- there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
The iron bars are up for life .
"-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Lock-out Time ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Little House ' -RSB- V THE LITTLE HOUSE Everybody has heard of the Little House in the Kensington Gardens , which is the only house in the whole world that the fairies have built for humans ."
"But no one has really seen it , except just three or four , and they have not only seen it but slept in it , and unless you sleep in it you never see it ."
"This is because it is not there when you lie down , but it is there when you wake up and step outside ."
"In a kind of way every one may see it , but what you see is not really it , but only the light in the windows ."
You see the light after Lock-out Time .
"David , for instance , saw it quite distinctly far away among the trees as we were going home from the pantomime , and Oliver Bailey saw it the night he stayed so late at the Temple , which is the name of his father 's office ."
"Angela Clare , who loves to have a tooth extracted because then she is treated to tea in a shop , saw more than one light , she saw hundreds of them all together ; and this must have been the fairies building the house , for they build it every night , and always in a different part of the Gardens ."
"She thought one of the lights was bigger than the others , though she was not quite sure , for they jumped about so , and it might have been another one that was bigger ."
"But if it was the same one , it was Peter Pan 's light ."
"Heaps of children have seen the light , so that is nothing ."
But Maimie Mannering was the famous one for whom the house was first built .
"Maimie was always rather a strange girl , and it was at night that she was strange ."
"She was four years of age , and in the daytime she was the ordinary kind ."
"She was pleased when her brother Tony , who was a magnificent fellow of six , took notice of her , and she looked up to him in the right way , and tried in vain to imitate him , and was flattered rather than annoyed when he shoved her about ."
"Also , when she was batting , she would pause though the ball was in the air to point out to you that she was wearing new shoes ."
She was quite the ordinary kind in the daytime .
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter Pan is the fairies ' orchestra -RSB- But as the shades of night fell , Tony , the swaggerer , lost his contempt for Maimie and eyed her fearfully ; and no wonder , for with dark there came into her face a look that I can describe only as a leary look ."
It was also a serene look that contrasted grandly with Tony 's uneasy glances .
Then I tell myself ` mere coincidence ' -- ` subconscious memory ' and so forth . ''
"`` I do not see how any memory could remember a thing before it was ever said at all , '' persisted Susan , `` though of course I am not educated like you and the doctor ."
"I would rather not be , if it makes anything as simple as that so hard to believe ."
"But in any case we need not worry over Verdun , even if the Huns get it ."
Joffre says it has no military significance . ''
"`` That old sop of comfort has been served up too often already when reverses came , '' retorted Gertrude ."
`` It has lost its power to charm . ''
`` Was there ever a battle like this in the world before ? ''
"said Mr. Meredith , one evening in mid-April ."
"`` It 's such a titanic thing we ca n't grasp it , '' said the doctor ."
`` What were the scraps of a few Homeric handfuls compared to this ?
The whole Trojan war might be fought around a Verdun fort and a newspaper correspondent would give it no more than a sentence .
I am not in the confidence of the occult powers '' -- the doctor threw Gertrude a twinkle -- `` but I have a hunch that the fate of the whole war hangs on the issue of Verdun .
"As Susan and Joffre say , it has no real military significance ; but it has the tremendous significance of an Idea ."
If Germany wins there she will win the war .
"If she loses , the tide will set against her . ''"
"`` Lose she will , '' said Mr. Meredith : emphatically ."
`` The Idea can not be conquered .
France is certainly very wonderful .
It seems to me that in her I see the white form of civilization making a determined stand against the black powers of barbarism .
I think our whole world realizes this and that is why we all await the issue so breathlessly .
It is n't merely the question of a few forts changing hands or a few miles of blood-soaked ground lost and won . ''
"`` I wonder , '' said Gertrude dreamily , `` if some great blessing , great enough for the price , will be the meed of all our pain ?"
Is the agony in which the world is shuddering the birth-pang of some wondrous new era ?
Or is it merely a futile struggle of ants In the gleam of a million million of suns ?
"We think very lightly , Mr. Meredith , of a calamity which destroys an ant-hill and half its inhabitants ."
Does the Power that runs the universe think us of more importance than we think ants ? ''
"`` You forget , '' said Mr. Meredith , with a flash of his dark eyes , `` that an infinite Power must be infinitely little as well as infinitely great ."
"We are neither , therefore there are things too little as well as too great for us to apprehend ."
To the infinitely little an ant is of as much importance as a mastodon .
"We are witnessing the birth-pangs of a new era -- but it will be born a feeble , wailing life like everything else ."
I am not one of those who expect a new heaven and a new earth as the immediate result of this war .
"remarked Miss Draper , who felt uncomfortably near crying herself ."
`` You might go out and pick a basket of Golden Gems .
I want to make some jelly for Patty . ''
Margaret 's Patient -LSB- Illustration : `` DID DR. FORBES THINK SHE OUGHT TO GIVE UP HER TRIP ? '' -RSB-
Margaret paused a moment at the gate and looked back at the quaint old house under its snowy firs with a thrill of proprietary affection .
"It was her home ; for the first time in her life she had a real home , and the long , weary years of poorly paid drudgery were all behind her ."
Before her was a prospect of independence and many of the delights she had always craved ; in the immediate future was a trip to Vancouver with Mrs. Boyd .
"For I shall go , of course , thought Margaret , as she walked briskly down the snowy road ."
"I 've always wanted to see the Rockies , and to go there with Mrs. Boyd will double the pleasure ."
She is such a delightful companion .
Margaret Campbell had been an orphan ever since she could remember .
"She had been brought up by a distant relative of her father 's -- that is , she had been given board , lodging , some schooling and indifferent clothes for the privilege of working like a little drudge in the house of the grim cousin who sheltered her ."
The death of this cousin flung Margaret on her own resources .
"A friend had procured her employment as the `` companion '' of a rich , eccentric old lady , infirm of health and temper ."
"Margaret lived with her for five years , and to the young girl they seemed treble the time ."
"Her employer was fault-finding , peevish , unreasonable , and many a time Margaret 's patience almost failed her -- almost , but not quite ."
In the end it brought her a more tangible reward than sometimes falls to the lot of the toiler .
"Mrs. Constance died , and in her will she left to Margaret her little up-country cottage and enough money to provide her an income for the rest of her life ."
"Margaret took immediate possession of her little house and , with the aid of a capable old servant , soon found herself very comfortable ."
"She realized that her days of drudgery were over , and that henceforth life would be a very different thing from what it had been ."
Margaret meant to have `` a good time . ''
She had never had any pleasure and now she was resolved to garner in all she could of the joys of existence .
"`` I 'm not going to do a single useful thing for a year , '' she had told Mrs. Boyd gaily ."
"`` Just think of it -- a whole delightful year of vacation , to go and come at will , to read , travel , dream , rest ."
"After that , I mean to see if I can find something to do for other folks , but I 'm going to have this one golden year ."
And the first thing in it is our trip to Vancouver .
I 'm so glad I have the chance to go with you .
"It 's a wee bit short notice , but I 'll be ready when you want to start . ''"
"Altogether , Margaret felt pretty well satisfied with life as she tripped blithely down the country road between the ranks of snow-laden spruces , with the blue sky above and the crisp , exhilarating air all about ."
"There was only one drawback , but it was a pretty serious one ."
"It 's so lonely by spells , Margaret sometimes thought wistfully ."
All the joys my good fortune has brought me ca n't quite fill my heart .
For generosity 's sake I dare not speak my mind upon this head ; but I thought of it none the less .
"I thought of it all the more , too , when the bouman brought out a green purse with four guineas in gold , and the best part of another in small change ."
"True , it was more than I had ."
"But then Alan , with less than five guineas , had to get as far as France ; I , with my less than two , not beyond Queensferry ; so that taking things in their proportion , Alan 's society was not only a peril to my life , but a burden on my purse ."
But there was no thought of the sort in the honest head of my companion .
"He believed he was serving , helping , and protecting me ."
"And what could I do but hold my peace , and chafe , and take my chance of it ?"
"`` It 's little enough , '' said Alan , putting the purse in his pocket , `` but it 'll do my business ."
"And now , John Breck , if ye will hand me over my button , this gentleman and me will be for taking the road . ''"
"But the bouman , after feeling about in a hairy purse that hung in front of him in the Highland manner -LRB- though he wore otherwise the Lowland habit , with sea-trousers -RRB- , began to roll his eyes strangely , and at last said , `` Her nainsel will loss it , '' meaning he thought he had lost it ."
`` What ! ''
"cried Alan , `` you will lose my button , that was my father 's before me ?"
"Now I will tell you what is in my mind , John Breck : it is in my mind this is the worst day 's work that ever ye did since ye was born . ''"
"And as Alan spoke , he set his hands on his knees and looked at the bouman with a smiling mouth , and that dancing light in his eyes that meant mischief to his enemies ."
"Perhaps the bouman was honest enough ; perhaps he had meant to cheat and then , finding himself alone with two of us in a desert place , cast back to honesty as being safer ; at least , and all at once , he seemed to find that button and handed it to Alan ."
"`` Well , and it is a good thing for the honour of the Maccolls , '' said Alan , and then to me , `` Here is my button back again , and I thank you for parting with it , which is of a piece with all your friendships to me . ''"
Then he took the warmest parting of the bouman .
"`` For , '' says he , `` ye have done very well by me , and set your neck at a venture , and I will always give you the name of a good man . ''"
"Lastly , the bouman took himself off by one way ; and Alan and I -LRB- getting our chattels together -RRB- struck into another to resume our flight ."
"CHAPTER XXII THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE MOOR Some seven hours ' incessant , hard travelling brought us early in the morning to the end of a range of mountains ."
"In front of us there lay a piece of low , broken , desert land , which we must now cross ."
"The sun was not long up , and shone straight in our eyes ; a little , thin mist went up from the face of the moorland like a smoke ; so that -LRB- as Alan said -RRB- there might have been twenty squadron of dragoons there and we none the wiser ."
"We sat down , therefore , in a howe of the hill-side till the mist should have risen , and made ourselves a dish of drammach , and held a council of war ."
"`` David , '' said Alan , `` this is the kittle bit ."
"Shall we lie here till it comes night , or shall we risk it , and stave on ahead ? ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I am tired indeed , but I could walk as far again , if that was all . ''"
"`` Ay , but it isnae , '' said Alan , `` nor yet the half ."
This is how we stand : Appin 's fair death to us .
"To the south it 's all Campbells , and no to be thought of ."
"To the north ; well , there 's no muckle to be gained by going north ; neither for you , that wants to get to Queensferry , nor yet for me , that wants to get to France ."
"Well , then , we 'll can strike east . ''"
`` East be it ! ''
"So saying , the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door ."
"I was very uneasy and alarmed , as you may fancy , and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself ."
He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath ; and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat .
"At last in strode the captain , slammed the door behind him , without looking to the right or left , and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him ."
"`` Bill , '' said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big ."
"The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us ; all the brown had gone out of his face , and even his nose was blue ; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost , or the evil one , or something worse , if anything can be ; and upon my word , I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick ."
"`` Come , Bill , you know me ; you know an old shipmate , Bill , surely , '' said the stranger ."
The captain made a sort of gasp .
`` Black Dog ! ''
said he .
`` And who else ? ''
"returned the other , getting more at his ease ."
"`` Black Dog as ever was , come for to see his old shipmate Billy , at the Admiral Benbow inn ."
"Ah , Bill , Bill , we have seen a sight of times , us two , since I lost them two talons , '' holding up his mutilated hand ."
"`` Now , look here , '' said the captain ; `` you 've run me down ; here I am ; well , then , speak up ; what is it ? ''"
"`` That 's you , Bill , '' returned Black Dog , `` you 're in the right of it , Billy ."
"I 'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here , as I 've took such a liking to ; and we 'll sit down , if you please , and talk square , like old shipmates . ''"
"When I returned with the rum , they were already seated on either side of the captain 's breakfast-table -- Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one , as I thought , on his retreat ."
He bade me go and leave the door wide open .
"`` None of your keyholes for me , sonny , '' he said ; and I left them together and retired into the bar ."
"For a long time , though I certainly did my best to listen , I could hear nothing but a low gattling ; but at last the voices began to grow higher , and I could pick up a word or two , mostly oaths , from the captain ."
"`` No , no , no , no ; and an end of it ! ''"
he cried once .
"And again , `` If it comes to swinging , swing all , say I. '' Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noises -- the chair and table went over in a lump , a clash of steel followed , and then a cry of pain , and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight , and the captain hotly pursuing , both with drawn cutlasses , and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder ."
"Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut , which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow ."
You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day .
That blow was the last of the battle .
"Once out upon the road , Black Dog , in spite of his wound , showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute ."
"The captain , for his part , stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man ."
Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house .
"`` Jim , '' says he , `` rum '' ; and as he spoke , he reeled a little , and caught himself with one hand against the wall ."
`` Are you hurt ? ''
"'T was Bennet Hatch that burned it , now five years agone ."
"In sooth , 't was pity , for it was a fair house . ''"
"Down in the hollow , where no wind blew , it was both warm and still ; and Matcham , laying one hand upon Dick 's arm , held up a warning finger ."
`` Hist ! ''
he said .
"Then came a strange sound , breaking on the quiet ."
It was twice repeated ere they recognised its nature .
"It was the sound of a big man clearing his throat ; and just then a hoarse , untuneful voice broke into singing ."
"`` Then up and spake the master , the king of the outlaws : ` What make ye here , my merry men , among the greenwood shaws ? '"
"And Gamelyn made answer -- he looked never adown : ` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town ! ' ''"
"The singer paused , a faint clink of iron followed , and then silence ."
The two lads stood looking at each other .
"Whoever he might be , their invisible neighbour was just beyond the ruin ."
"And suddenly the colour came into Matcham 's face , and next moment he had crossed the fallen rafter , and was climbing cautiously on the huge pile of lumber that filled the interior of the roofless house ."
"Dick would have withheld him , had he been in time ; as it was , he was fain to follow ."
"Right in the corner of the ruin , two rafters had fallen crosswise , and protected a clear space no larger than a pew in church ."
Into this the lads silently lowered themselves .
"There they were perfectly concealed , and through an arrow-loophole commanded a view upon the farther side ."
"Peering through this , they were struck stiff with terror at their predicament ."
To retreat was impossible ; they scarce dared to breathe .
"Upon the very margin of the ditch , not thirty feet from where they crouched , an iron caldron bubbled and steamed above a glowing fire ; and close by , in an attitude of listening , as though he had caught some sound of their clambering among the ruins , a tall , red-faced , battered-looking man stood poised , an iron spoon in his right hand , a horn and a formidable dagger at his belt ."
"Plainly this was the singer ; plainly he had been stirring the caldron , when some incautious step among the lumber had fallen upon his ear ."
"A little further off , another man lay slumbering , rolled in a brown cloak , with a butterfly hovering above his face ."
"All this was in a clearing white with daisies ; and at the extreme verge , a bow , a sheaf of arrows , and part of a deer 's carcase , hung upon a flowering hawthorn ."
"Presently the fellow relaxed from his attitude of attention , raised the spoon to his mouth , tasted its contents , nodded , and then fell again to stirring and singing . ''"
"` O , they must need to walk in wood that may not walk in town , ' '' he croaked , taking up his song where he had left it ."
"`` O , sir , we walk not here at all an evil thing to do ."
But if we meet with the good king 's deer to shoot a shaft into . ''
"Still as he sang , he took from time to time , another spoonful of the broth , blew upon it , and tasted it , with all the airs of an experienced cook ."
"At length , apparently , he judged the mess was ready ; for taking the horn from his girdle , he blew three modulated calls ."
"The other fellow awoke , rolled over , brushed away the butterfly , and looked about him ."
"`` How now , brother ? ''"
She even tried to make her heart go softly .
Will they reach the nursery in time ?
"If so , how delightful for them , and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief , but there will be no story ."
"On the other hand , if they are not in time , I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end ."
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them .
"Once again the stars blew the window open , and that smallest star of all called out : ` Cave , Peter ! '"
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose .
"` Come , ' he cried imperiously , and soared out at once into the night , followed by John and Michael and Wendy ."
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late .
The birds were flown .
"-LSB- Illustration : THE BIRDS WERE FLOWN -RSB- CHAPTER IV THE FLIGHT ` Second to the right , and straight on till morning . '"
"That , Peter had told Wendy , was the way to the Neverland ; but even birds , carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners , could not have sighted it with these instructions ."
"Peter , you see , just said anything that came into his head ."
"At first his companions trusted him implicitly , and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy ."
"John and Michael raced , Michael getting a start ."
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room .
Not so long ago .
But how long ago ?
They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously .
John thought it was their second sea and their third night .
"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light , and now they were very cold and again too warm ."
"Did they really feel hungry at times , or were they merely pretending , because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them ?"
"His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them ; then the birds would follow and snatch it back ; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles , parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will ."
"But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter , nor even that there are other ways ."
"Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy , they were sleepy ; and that was a danger , for the moment they popped off , down they fell ."
The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny .
` There he goes again ! '
"he would cry gleefully , as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone ."
"` Save him , save him ! '"
"cried Wendy , looking with horror at the cruel sea far below ."
"Eventually Peter would dive through the air , and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea , and it was lovely the way he did it ; but he always waited till the last moment , and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life ."
"Also he was fond of variety , and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him , so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go ."
said the eyes of one to the eyes of the other .
Meanwhile the swallows had spoken again .
` That was indeed good fortune ! '
cried they .
` And when the children are grown up they can return to their father and set their mother free . '
"` It will not be so easy as you think , ' answered the city swallow , shaking her head ; ` for they will have to prove that they are the king 's children , and also that their mother never went mad at all ."
"In fact , it is so difficult that there is only one way of proving it to the king . '"
` And what is that ? '
cried all the swallows at once .
` And how do you know it ? ' '
"I know it , ' answered the city swallow , ` because , one day , when I was passing through the palace garden , I met a cuckoo , who , as I need not tell you , always pretends to be able to see into the future ."
"We began to talk about certain things which were happening in the palace , and of the events of past years ."
"`` Ah , '' said he , `` the only person who can expose the wickedness of the ministers and show the king how wrong he has been , is the Bird of Truth , who can speak the language of men . '' '"
`` And where can this bird be found ? ''
I asked . '
"`` It is shut up in a castle guarded by a fierce giant , who only sleeps one quarter of an hour out of the whole twenty-four , '' replied the cuckoo ."
` And where is this castle ? '
"inquired the country swallow , who , like all the rest , and the children most of all , had been listening with deep attention ."
"` That is just what I do n't know , ' answered her friend ."
"` All I can tell you is that not far from here is a tower , where dwells an old witch , and it is she who knows the way , and she will only teach it to the person who promises to bring her the water from the fountain of many colours , which she uses for her enchantments ."
"But never will she betray the place where the Bird of Truth is hidden , for she hates him , and would kill him if she could ; knowing well , however , that this bird can not die , as he is immortal , she keeps him closely shut up , and guarded night and day by the Birds of Bad Faith , who seek to gag him so that his voice should not be heard . '"
"` And is there no one else who can tell the poor boy where to find the bird , if he should ever manage to reach the tower ? '"
asked the country swallow .
"` No one , ' replied the city swallow , ` except an owl , who lives a hermit 's life in that desert , and he knows only one word of man 's speech , and that is `` cross . ''"
"So that even if the prince did succeed in getting there , he could never understand what the owl said ."
"But , look , the sun is sinking to his nest in the depths of the sea , and I must go to mine ."
"Good-night , friends , good-night ! '"
"Then the swallow flew away , and the children , who had forgotten both hunger and weariness in the joy of this strange news , rose up and followed in the direction of her flight ."
"After two hours ' walking , they arrived at a large city , which they felt sure must be the capital of their father 's kingdom ."
"Seeing a good-natured looking woman standing at the door of a house , they asked her if she would give them a night 's lodging , and she was so pleased with their pretty faces and nice manners that she welcomed them warmly ."
"It was scarcely light the next morning before the girl was sweeping out the rooms , and the boy watering the garden , so that by the time the good woman came downstairs there was nothing left for her to do ."
"This so delighted her that she begged the children to stay with her altogether , and the boy answered that he would leave his sisters with her gladly , but that he himself had serious business on hand and must not linger in pursuit of it ."
"Even as I spoke on these grave subjects , my eye would take a glad bit of a run over the prospect , and my heart jump with pride ."
"About my clear duty to my friend , the lawyer had no doubt ."
"I must help him out of the county at whatever risk ; but in the case of James , he was of a different mind ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , '' says he , `` is one thing , Mr. Thomson 's kinsman quite another ."
"I know little of the facts , but I gather that a great noble -LRB- whom we will call , if you like , the D. of A. -RRB- * has some concern and is even supposed to feel some animosity in the matter ."
"The D. of A. is doubtless an excellent nobleman ; but , Mr. David , timeo qui nocuere deos ."
"If you interfere to balk his vengeance , you should remember there is one way to shut your testimony out ; and that is to put you in the dock ."
"There , you would be in the same pickle as Mr. Thomson 's kinsman ."
"You will object that you are innocent ; well , but so is he ."
"And to be tried for your life before a Highland jury , on a Highland quarrel and with a Highland Judge upon the bench , would be a brief transition to the gallows . ''"
* The Duke of Argyle .
Now I had made all these reasonings before and found no very good reply to them ; so I put on all the simplicity I could .
"`` In that case , sir , '' said I , `` I would just have to be hanged -- would I not ? ''"
"`` My dear boy , '' cries he , `` go in God 's name , and do what you think is right ."
It is a poor thought that at my time of life I should be advising you to choose the safe and shameful ; and I take it back with an apology .
"Go and do your duty ; and be hanged , if you must , like a gentleman ."
There are worse things in the world than to be hanged . ''
"`` Not many , sir , '' said I , smiling ."
"`` Why , yes , sir , '' he cried , `` very many ."
And it would be ten times better for your uncle -LRB- to go no farther afield -RRB- if he were dangling decently upon a gibbet . ''
"Thereupon he turned into the house -LRB- still in a great fervour of mind , so that I saw I had pleased him heartily -RRB- and there he wrote me two letters , making his comments on them as he wrote ."
"`` This , '' says he , `` is to my bankers , the British Linen Company , placing a credit to your name ."
"Consult Mr. Thomson , he will know of ways ; and you , with this credit , can supply the means ."
"I trust you will be a good husband of your money ; but in the affair of a friend like Mr. Thomson , I would be even prodigal ."
"Then for his kinsman , there is no better way than that you should seek the Advocate , tell him your tale , and offer testimony ; whether he may take it or not , is quite another matter , and will turn on the D. of A. Now , that you may reach the Lord Advocate well recommended , I give you here a letter to a namesake of your own , the learned Mr. Balfour of Pilrig , a man whom I esteem ."
It will look better that you should be presented by one of your own name ; and the laird of Pilrig is much looked up to in the Faculty and stands well with Lord Advocate Grant .
"I would not trouble him , if I were you , with any particulars ; and -LRB- do you know ? -RRB-"
I think it would be needless to refer to Mr. Thomson .
"Form yourself upon the laird , he is a good model ; when you deal with the Advocate , be discreet ; and in all these matters , may the Lord guide you , Mr. David ! ''"
"Thereupon he took his farewell , and set out with Torrance for the Ferry , while Alan and I turned our faces for the city of Edinburgh ."
"As we went by the footpath and beside the gateposts and the unfinished lodge , we kept looking back at the house of my fathers ."
"It stood there , bare and great and smokeless , like a place not lived in ; only in one of the top windows , there was the peak of a nightcap bobbing up and down and back and forward , like the head of a rabbit from a burrow ."
"It was because his boat had got wedged on the Serpentine between fields of floating ice , through which he had to break a perilous passage with his trusty paddle ."
"The fairies had as yet scarcely missed him , for they could not dance , so heavy were their hearts ."
"They forget all the steps when they are sad , and remember them again when they are merry ."
"David tells me that fairies never say , ` We feel happy ' : what they say is , ` We feel dancey . '"
"Well , they were looking very undancey indeed , when sudden laughter broke out among the onlookers , caused by Brownie , who had just arrived and was insisting on her right to be presented to the Duke ."
"Maimie craned forward eagerly to see how her friend fared , though she had really no hope ; no one seemed to have the least hope except Brownie herself , who , however , was absolutely confident ."
"She was led before his grace , and the doctor putting a finger carelessly on the ducal heart , which for convenience ' sake was reached by a little trap-door in his diamond shirt , had begun to say mechanically , ` Cold , qui -- , ' when he stopped abruptly ."
` What 's this ? '
"he cried , and first he shook the heart like a watch , and then he put his ear to it ."
` Bless my soul ! '
"cried the doctor , and by this time of course the excitement among the spectators was tremendous , fairies fainting right and left ."
"-LSB- Illustration : They warned her -RSB- Everybody stared breathlessly at the Duke , who was very much startled , and looked as if he would like to run away ."
` Good gracious me ! '
"the doctor was heard muttering , and now the heart was evidently on fire , for he had to jerk his fingers away from it and put them in his mouth ."
The suspense was awful .
"Then in a loud voice , and bowing low , ` My Lord Duke , ' said the physician elatedly , ' I have the honour to inform your excellency that your grace is in love . '"
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , ' O Brownie , how splendid ! '"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say , ` Oh dear ! '"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie ; too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates ; she heard the murmur of an angry multitude ; she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
"I got her through my old friend , Blandly , who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump ."
"The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest , and so , I may say , did everyone in Bristol , as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for -- treasure , I mean ."
"`` Redruth , '' said I , interrupting the letter , `` Dr. Livesey will not like that ."
"The squire has been talking , after all . ''"
"`` Well , who 's a better right ? ''"
growled the gamekeeper .
"`` A pretty rum go if squire ai n't to talk for Dr. Livesey , I should think . ''"
"At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on : Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA , and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle ."
There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly .
"They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money , that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him , and that he sold it me absurdly high -- the most transparent calumnies ."
"None of them dare , however , to deny the merits of the ship ."
So far there was not a hitch .
"The workpeople , to be sure -- riggers and what not -- were most annoyingly slow ; but time cured that ."
It was the crew that troubled me .
"I wished a round score of men -- in case of natives , buccaneers , or the odious French -- and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen , till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required ."
"I was standing on the dock , when , by the merest accident , I fell in talk with him ."
"I found he was an old sailor , kept a public-house , knew all the seafaring men in Bristol , had lost his health ashore , and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again ."
"He had hobbled down there that morning , he said , to get a smell of the salt ."
"I was monstrously touched -- so would you have been -- and , out of pure pity , I engaged him on the spot to be ship 's cook ."
"Long John Silver , he is called , and has lost a leg ; but that I regarded as a recommendation , since he lost it in his country 's service , under the immortal Hawke ."
"He has no pension , Livesey ."
Imagine the abominable age we live in !
"Well , sir , I thought I had only found a cook , but it was a crew I had discovered ."
"Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable -- not pretty to look at , but fellows , by their faces , of the most indomitable spirit ."
I declare we could fight a frigate .
Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged .
He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance .
"I am in the most magnificent health and spirits , eating like a bull , sleeping like a tree , yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan ."
"Seaward , ho !"
Hang the treasure !
It 's the glory of the sea that has turned my head .
"So now , Livesey , come post ; do not lose an hour , if you respect me ."
"Tom , give me one end of a cord here ; I will so truss me this sea-thief , hand and foot together , like a basting turkey -- marry , I will so bind him up -- and thereafter I will so beat -- so beat him ! ''"
"And so he ran on , winding the cord meanwhile about Dick 's limbs with the dexterity peculiar to seamen , and at every turn and cross securing it with a knot , and tightening the whole fabric with a savage pull ."
"When he had done , the lad was a mere package in his hands -- as helpless as the dead ."
"The skipper held him at arm 's length , and laughed aloud ."
"Then he fetched him a stunning buffet on the ear ; and then turned him about , and furiously kicked and kicked him ."
"Anger rose up in Dick 's bosom like a storm ; anger strangled him , and he thought to have died ; but when the sailor , tired of this cruel play , dropped him all his length upon the sand and turned to consult with his companions , he instantly regained command of his temper ."
"Here was a momentary respite ; ere they began again to torture him , he might have found some method to escape from this degrading and fatal misadventure ."
"Presently , sure enough , and while his captors were still discussing what to do with him , he took heart of grace , and , with a pretty steady voice , addressed them ."
"`` My masters , '' he began , `` are ye gone clean foolish ?"
"Here hath Heaven put into your hands as pretty an occasion to grow rich as ever shipman had -- such as ye might make thirty over-sea adventures and not find again -- and , by the mass I what do ye ?"
Beat me ?
-- nay ; so would an angry child !
"But for long-headed tarry-Johns , that fear not fire nor water , and that love gold as they love beef , methinks ye are not wise . ''"
"`` Ay , '' said Tom , `` now y ' are trussed ye would cozen us . ''"
`` Cozen you ! ''
repeated Dick .
"`` Nay , if ye be fools , it would be easy ."
"But if ye be shrewd fellows , as I trow ye are , ye can see plainly where your interest lies ."
"When I took your ship from you , we were many , we were well clad and armed ; but now , bethink you a little , who mustered that array ?"
One incontestably that hath much gold .
"And if he , being already rich , continueth to hunt after more even in the face of storms -- bethink you once more -- shall there not be a treasure somewhere hidden ? ''"
`` What meaneth he ? ''
asked one of the men .
"`` Why , if ye have lost an old skiff and a few jugs of vinegary wine , '' continued Dick , `` forget them , for the trash they are ; and do ye rather buckle to an adventure worth the name , that shall , in twelve hours , make or mar you for ever ."
"But take me up from where I lie , and let us go somewhere near at hand and talk across a flagon , for I am sore and frozen , and my mouth is half among the snow . ''"
"`` He seeks but to cozen us , '' said Tom , contemptuously ."
`` Cozen !
cozen ! ''
cried the third man .
`` I would I could see the man that could cozen me !
He were a cozener indeed !
"Nay , I was not born yesterday ."
Peter flung out his arms .
"There were no children there , and it was night time ; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland , and who were therefore nearer to him than you think : boys and girls in their nighties , and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees ."
`` Do you believe ? ''
he cried .
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate .
"She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative , and then again she was n't sure ."
`` What do you think ? ''
she asked Peter .
"`` If you believe , '' he shouted to them , `` clap your hands ; do n't let Tink die . ''"
Many clapped .
Some did n't .
A few beasts hissed .
The clapping stopped suddenly ; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening ; but already Tink was saved .
"First her voice grew strong , then she popped out of bed , then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever ."
"She never thought of thanking those who believed , but she would have like to get at the ones who had hissed ."
`` And now to rescue Wendy ! ''
"The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree , begirt -LSB- belted -RSB- with weapons and wearing little else , to set out upon his perilous quest ."
It was not such a night as he would have chosen .
"He had hoped to fly , keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes ; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees , thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir ."
He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach .
"There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion , at which happily he was an adept -LSB- expert -RSB- ."
"But in what direction , for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship ?"
"A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks ; and a deathly silence pervaded the island , as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage ."
"He had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell , and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it ."
"Slightly , if he had an opportunity , would blaze -LSB- cut a mark in -RSB- the trees , for instance , Curly would drop seeds , and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place ."
"The morning was needed to search for such guidance , and he could not wait ."
"The upper world had called him , but would give no help ."
"The crocodile passed him , but not another living thing , not a sound , not a movement ; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree , or stalking him from behind ."
He swore this terrible oath : `` Hook or me this time . ''
"Now he crawled forward like a snake , and again erect , he darted across a space on which the moonlight played , one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready ."
He was frightfully happy .
"Chapter 14 THE PIRATE SHIP One green light squinting over Kidd 's Creek , which is near the mouth of the pirate river , marked where the brig , the JOLLY ROGER , lay , low in the water ; a rakish-looking -LSB- speedy-looking -RSB- craft foul to the hull , every beam in her detestable , like ground strewn with mangled feathers ."
"He was on the point of turning homeward , with an unreasoning sense of disappointment , when one of Lynde 's dogs broke down through the hedge of spruces , barking loudly ."
"Alan looked for Lynde to follow , but she did not , and he speedily saw that there was something unusual about the dog 's behaviour ."
"The animal circled around him , still barking excitedly , then ran off for a short distance , stopped , barked again , and returned , repeating the manoeuvre ."
"It was plain that he wanted Alan to follow him , and it occurred to the young minister that the dog 's mistress must be in danger of some kind ."
"Instantly he set off after him ; and the dog , with a final sharp bark of satisfaction , sprang up the low bank into the spruces ."
"Alan followed him across the peninsula and then along the further shore , which rapidly grew steep and high ."
"Half a mile down the cliffs were rocky and precipitous , while the beach beneath them was heaped with huge boulders ."
Alan followed the dog along one of the narrow paths with which the barrens abounded until nearly a mile from Four Winds .
"Then the animal halted , ran to the edge of the cliff and barked ."
"It was an ugly-looking place where a portion of the soil had evidently broken away recently , and Alan stepped cautiously out to the brink and looked down ."
He could not repress an exclamation of dismay and alarm .
"A few feet below him Lynde Oliver was lying on a mass of mossy soil which was apparently on the verge of slipping over a sloping shelf of rock , below which was a sheer drop of thirty feet to the cruel boulders below ."
"The extreme danger of her position was manifest at a glance ; the soil on which she lay was stationary , yet it seemed as if the slightest motion on her part would send it over the brink ."
"Lynde lay movelessly ; her face was white , and both fear and appeal were visible in her large dilated eyes ."
Yet she was quite calm and a faint smile crossed her pale lips as she saw the man and the dog .
"`` Good faithful Pat , so you did bring help , '' she said ."
"`` But how can I help you , Miss Oliver ? ''"
said Alan hoarsely .
`` I can not reach you -- and it looks as if the slightest touch or jar would send that broken earth over the brink . ''
`` I fear it would .
You must go back to Four Winds and get a rope . ''
`` And leave you here alone -- in such danger ? ''
`` Pat will stay with me .
"Besides , there is nothing else to do ."
You will find a rope in that little house where you put the water for Emily .
Father and Emily are away .
I think I am quite safe here if I do n't move at all . ''
"Alan 's own common sense told him that , as she said , there was nothing else to do and , much as he hated to leave her alone thus , he realized that he must lose no time in doing it ."
"`` I 'll be back as quickly as possible , '' he said hurriedly ."
Alan had been a noted runner at college and his muscles had not forgotten their old training .
"Yet it seemed to him an age ere he reached Four Winds , secured the rope , and returned ."
At every flying step he was haunted by the thought of the girl lying on the brink of the precipice and the fear that she might slip over it before he could rescue her .
Here they would take out the bits of bread they had saved from their breakfasts and crumble them for the birds .
"In return , the birds taught them many things : how to get up early in the morning , how to sing , and how to talk their language , which very few people know ."
"But though the little orphans did their best to avoid quarrelling with their foster-brothers , it was very difficult always to keep the peace ."
"Matters got worse and worse till , one morning , the eldest boy said to the twins : ` It is all very well for you to pretend that you have such good manners , and are so much better than we , but we have at least a father and mother , while you have only got the river , like the toads and the frogs . '"
The poor children did not answer the insult ; but it made them very unhappy .
"And they told each other in whispers that they could not stay there any longer , but must go into the world and seek their fortunes ."
So next day they arose as early as the birds and stole downstairs without anybody hearing them .
"One window was open , and they crept softly out and ran to the side of the river ."
"Then , feeling as if they had found a friend , they walked along its banks , hoping that by-and-by they should meet some one to take care of them ."
"The whole of that day they went steadily on without seeing a living creature , till , in the evening , weary and footsore , they saw before them a small hut ."
"This raised their spirits for a moment ; but the door was shut , and the hut seemed empty , and so great was their disappointment that they almost cried ."
"However , the boy fought down his tears , and said cheerfully : ` Well , at any rate here is a bench where we can sit down , and when we are rested we will think what is best to do next . '"
"Then they sat down , and for some time they were too tired even to notice anything ; but by-and-by they saw that under the tiles of the roof a number of swallows were sitting , chattering merrily to each other ."
"Of course the swallows had no idea that the children understood their language , or they would not have talked so freely ; but , as it was , they said whatever came into their heads ."
"` Good evening , my fine city madam , ' remarked a swallow , whose manners were rather rough and countryfied to another who looked particularly distinguished ."
"` Happy , indeed , are the eyes that behold you !"
"Only think of your having returned to your long-forgotten country friends , after you have lived for years in a palace ! ' '"
"I have inherited this nest from my parents , ' replied the other , ` and as they left it to me I certainly shall make it my home ."
"But , ' she added politely , ' I hope that you and all your family are well ? '"
"` Very well indeed , I am glad to say ."
"But my poor daughter had , a short time ago , such bad inflammation in her eyes that she would have gone blind had I not been able to find the magic herb , which cured her at once . '"
` And how is the nightingale singing ?
Does the lark soar as high as ever ?
And does the linnet dress herself as smartly ? '
But here the country swallow drew herself up . '
"I never talk gossip , ' she said severely ."
"` Our people , who were once so innocent and well-behaved , have been corrupted by the bad examples of men ."
It is a thousand pities . '
` What !
"innocence and good behaviour are not to be met with among birds , nor in the country !"
"My dear friend , what are you saying ? '"
` The truth and nothing more .
"` Not large enough to draw attention , of course ; but it might come in handy . '"
And with another nod he left her .
The next evening the mink washed and brushed himself carefully and set out for the feast .
"He smiled to himself as he looked at the dusty track , and perceived that though the marks of wolves ' feet were many , not a single guest was to be seen anywhere ."
He knew very well what that meant ; but he had taken his precautions and was not afraid .
"The house door stood open , but through a crack the mink could see the wolves crowding in the corner behind it ."
"However , he entered boldly , and as soon as he was fairly inside the door was shut with a bang , and the whole herd sprang at him , with their red tongues hanging out of their mouths ."
"Quick as they were they were too late , for the mink was already through the knot-hole and racing for his canoe ."
"The knot-hole was too small for the wolves , and there were so many of them in the hut that it was some time before they could get the door open ."
"Then they seized the bows and arrows which were hanging on the walls and , once outside , aimed at the flying mink ; but as they pulled the bows broke in their paws , so they threw them away , and bounded to the shore , with all their speed , to the place where their canoes were drawn up on the beach ."
"Now , although the mink could not run as fast as the wolves , he had a good start , and was already afloat when the swiftest among them threw themselves into the nearest canoe ."
"They pushed off , but as they dipped the paddles into the water , they snapped as the bows had done , and were quite useless . '"
"I know where there are some new ones , ' cried a young fellow , leaping on shore and rushing to a little cave at the back of the beach ."
"And the mink 's heart smote him when he heard , for he had not known of this secret store ."
"After a long chase the wolves managed to surround their prey , and the mink , seeing it was no good resisting any more , gave himself up ."
"Some of the elder wolves brought out some cedar bands , which they always carried wound round their bodies , but the mink laughed scornfully at the sight of them ."
"` Why I could snap those in a moment , ' said he ; ` if you want to make sure that I can not escape , better take a line of kelp and bind me with that . '"
"` You are right , ' answered the grandfather ; ` your wisdom is greater than ours . '"
"And he bade his servants gather enough kelp from the rocks to make a line , as they had brought none with them ."
"` While the line is being made you might as well let me have one last dance , ' remarked the mink ."
"And the wolves replied : ` Very good , you may have your dance ; perhaps it may amuse us as well as you . '"
So they brought two canoes and placed them one beside the other .
"The mink stood up on his hind legs and began to dance , first in one canoe and then in the other ; and so graceful was he , that the wolves forgot they were going to put him to death , and howled with pleasure ."
"` Pull the canoes a little apart ; they are too close for this new dance , ' he said , pausing for a moment ."
"And the wolves separated them while he gave a series of little springs , sometime pirouetting while he stood with one foot on the prow of both ."
"` Now nearer , now further apart , ' he would cry as the dance went on ."
` No !
further still . '
"And springing into the air , amidst howls of applause , he came down head-foremost , and dived to the bottom ."
"And through the wolves , whose howls had now changed into those of rage , sought him everywhere , they never found him , for he hid behind a rock till they were out of sight , and then made his home in another forest ."
Adventures of an Indian Brave -LSB- From the Journal of the Anthropological Institute . -RSB-
"A long , long way off , right away in the west of America , there once lived an old man who had one son ."
"But alas! he went out to die. In one battle, a small band of the English bravely attacked a large army of their enemies. The horse which Sidney was riding was killed under him, and as he mounted another, he was shot in the leg, and his thigh-bone was broken. The horse took fright and galloped away from the fight, but its wounded and bleeding rider held to his seat, and when he reached a place of safety was lifted from his horse, and gently laid upon the ground. He was faint from loss of blood, and in great pain, and his throat was parched with thirst."
"""Bring me water,"" said he to a friend."
"This was not easy to do, for there was not a stream near at hand, and in order to get to one it would be necessary to pass where the shot from the enemy's cannons was falling fast. But his friend was brave and went through the danger. Then he found some water, and brought it to him."
"Sidney eagerly held out his hand for the cup, and as he was preparing to drink, another poor wounded soldier was carried past. This man was dying; he could not speak, but he looked with longing eyes at the water."
"Sir Philip saw the look, and taking the cup from his own lips, passed it to the soldier, saying: ""Thy need is greater than mine."" The poor man quenched his thirst, and blessed him as he died."
"Sir Philip lived on for a few weeks, growing weaker every day, but he never came back to his own land, and the many friends who loved him."
"Sidney was great in many ways; very fair to see, very wise and good, and very clever and witty. He was one of the bravest fighters, one of the finest poets, and one of the best gentlemen who ever lived. He will always be remembered for his brave deeds, and his wise sayings, but most of all do men bless his name for this act of kindness to his poor dying comrade."
"The ""Revenge"""
"In the days of Queen Elizabeth, English sailors first began to find their way across the seas to new lands, from which they brought home many strange, and rich, and beautiful things. The Spaniards sailed across the seas too, to fetch gold and silver from the mines in Mexico, which belonged to the King of Spain. Sometimes the English ships met the Spanish ones, and robbed them of their gold, for it was thought quite right and fair in those days to take every chance of doing harm to the enemies of England. Of course the Spaniards hated the English for this, and whenever they met English ships which were weaker than theirs they attacked them, and robbed them, killing the sailors, or taking them prisoners."
"Once, a small ship, called the Revenge, was sailing home to England, when it met with fifty great Spanish vessels. The captain of the Revenge was Sir Richard Grenville, and he had a great many sick men on board. There was no time to escape from the Spanish ships, which soon surrounded the little Revenge. So there were only two courses which Sir Richard could take. One was to give up his ship to the Spaniards; the other was to fight with them till his men were all killed, or his ship sank."
"Some of the sailors wished him to take the first course, but the others, and all the sick men, said: ""Nay, let us fall into the hands of God, and not into the hands of Spain."" This they said because they thought it better to die, than to be made prisoners by the cruel Spaniards."
"Sir Richard made up his mind to fight. It was after noon when the firing began, and all night long, until daylight came, the little English ship kept the fifty Spanish vessels at bay. Then it was found that all the powder was gone, and all the English were dead or dying."
"And then only was the flag of the Revenge pulled down, to show that she surrendered to her enemies."
"The brave Sir Richard was taken on board a Spanish ship, where he soon died of his wounds."
"These were his last words: ""Here die I, Richard Grenville, with a joyful and quiet mind, for I have ended my life as a good soldier ought. I have fought for my country and my queen, for honour, and for God."""
The Pilgrim Fathers
"There was a time when the people of England were not allowed to pray to God in the way they thought right, but were punished if they did not worship as the king ordered. This was very hard, and when James I was king, a little band of brave people, who found that they could not obey the king, left their country to make a new home across the sea, where they could be free. They are called the ""Pilgrim Fathers""."
"A hundred people men, women, and children set sail in a little ship called the Mayflower for the new world which a great explorer called Columbus had discovered away in the west, and which we now call America."
"They had a long and stormy voyage, but at last, in mid-winter, they landed on the shores of North America, and set up their huts."
"At first they had much trouble, for the ground was frozen and barren."
"They suffered from hunger and sickness, and the wild Indians who lived in that land came down upon them and tried to drive them away. But the Pilgrim Fathers did not lose courage. They were free, and they worked hard, and waited in patience for brighter days. By and by other ships from England brought food to keep them alive, and more people to help them. Then they made friends with the Indians, and when spring came they planted seeds and grew crops for themselves."
"After a time many other Englishmen, who wished to be free, followed the Pilgrim Fathers, and settled in America. They founded the colonies of New England, which are now a part of the United States."
Guy Fawkes
"In the time of James I, many of the English people were very hardly treated because of their religion. At last they could bear the ill-usage no longer, and they thought of a plan to get rid of the king and queen and their eldest son."
"Many barrels of gunpowder were secretly put into a cellar under the Parliament House, where James was to meet his lords and commons on November 5; and a man named Guy Fawkes was hired to set fire to it at the right time, and so to blow up the hall above, and all in it."
"All was ready, when one of the plotters remembered that a friend of his would be at the meeting next day. As he did not wish him to be killed, he sent him a letter, without signing his name, saying: ""Do not go to the House, for there shall be a sudden blow to many, and they shall not see who hurts them""."
"The lord who received this letter took it to the King's Council, and when King James saw it, he guessed what the ""sudden blow"" would be. Men were sent to search the cellars, and there, on the very night before the deed was to be done, Guy Fawkes was found waiting till the time should come to set fire to the powder. He was cruelly tortured to make him tell all he knew, but he was a brave man, and he died without betraying his friends."
"Since that time, every year, on the 5th of November, bonfires have been lighted in many places in England, and ""guys"" burned, to remind people how an English king was once saved from a great danger."
"""Considering you're eight, you haven't much sense."" George kicked his boots against the fencing to warm his toes. ""It's half the world away."""
"""It looks very near,"" said Jane, hunching up her shoulders to keep her neck warm."
"""They're close to the North Pole,"" said George. ""Look here I don't care a straw about the Aurora Borealis, but I shouldn't mind discovering the North Pole: It's awfully difficult and dangerous, and then you come home and write a book about it with a lot of pictures, and everybody says how brave you are."""
Jane got off the fence.
"""Oh, George, let's,"" she said. ""We shall never have such a chance again all alone by ourselves and quite late, too."""
"""I'd go right enough if it wasn't for you,"" George answered gloomily, ""but you know they always say I lead you into mischief and if we went to the North Pole we should get our boots wet, as likely as not, and you remember what they said about not going on the grass."""
"""They said the lawn,"" said Jane. ""We're not going on the lawn. Oh, George, do, do let's. It doesn't look so very far we could be back before they had time to get dreadfully angry."""
"""All right,"" said George, ""but mind, I don't want to go."""
"So off they went. They got over the fence, which was very cold and white and shiny because it was beginning to freeze, and on the other side of the fence was somebody else's garden, so they got out of that as quickly as they could, and beyond that was a field where there was another big bonfire, with people standing around it who looked quite dark-skinned."
"""It's like Indians,"" said George, and wanted to stop and look, but Jane pulled him on, and they passed by the bonfire and got through a gap in the hedge into another field a dark one; and far away, beyond quite a number of other dark fields, the Northern Lights shone and sparkled and twinkled."
"Now, during the winter the Arctic regions come much farther south than they are marked on the map. Very few people know this, though you would think they could tell it by the ice in the jugs of a morning. And just when George and Jane were starting for the North Pole, the Arctic regions had come down very nearly as far as Forest Hill, so that, as the children walked on, it grew colder and colder, and presently they saw that the fields were covered with snow, and there were great icicles hanging from all the hedges and gates. And the Northern Lights still seemed some way off."
"They were crossing a very rough, snowy field when Jane first noticed the animals. There were white rabbits and white hares and all sorts and sizes of white birds, and some larger creatures in the shadows of the hedges that Jane was sure were wolves and bears."
"""Polar bears and Arctic wolves, of course I mean,"" she said, for she did not want George to think her stupid again."
"There was a great hedge at the end of this field, all covered with snow and icicles; but the children found a place where there was a hole, and as no bears or wolves seemed to be just in that part of the hedge, they crept through and scrambled out of the frozen ditch on the other side."
And then they stood still and held their breath with wonder.
"For in front of them, running straight and smooth right away to the Northern Lights, lay a great wide road of pure dark ice, and on each side were tall trees all sparkling with white frost, and from the boughs of the trees hung strings of stars threaded on fine moonbeams, and shining so brightly that it was like a beautiful fairy daylight. Jane said so; but George said it was like the electric lights at the Earl's Court Exhibition."
The rows of trees went as straight as ruled lines away away and away and at the other end of them shone the Aurora Borealis.
"There was a signpost of silvery snow, and on it in letters of pure ice the children read: THIS WAY TO THE NORTH POLE."
"Then George said: ""Way or no way, I know a slide when I see one so here goes."" And he took a run on the frozen snow, and Jane took a run when she saw him do it, and the next moment they were sliding away, each with feet half a yard apart, along the great slide that leads to the North Pole."
"This great slide is made for the convenience of the Polar bears, who, during the winter months, get their food from the Army and Navy Stores and it is the most perfect slide in the world. If you have never come across it, it is because you have never let off fireworks on the eleventh of December, and have never been thoroughly naughty and disobedient. But do not be these things in the hope of finding the great slide because you might find something quite different, and then you will be sorry."
"The great slide is like common slides in that when once you have started you have to go on to the end unless you fall down and then it hurts just as much as the smaller kind on ponds. The great slide runs downhill all the way, so that you keep on going faster and faster and faster. George and Jane went so fast that they had not time to notice the scenery. They only saw the long lines of frosted trees and the starry lamps, and on each side, rushing back as they slid on, a very broad, white world and a very large, black night; and overhead as well as in the trees the stars were bright like silver lamps, and far ahead shone and trembled and sparkled the line of fairy spears. Jane said that, and George said: ""I can see the Northern Lights quite plain."""
"It is very pleasant to slide and slide and slide on clear, dark ice especially if you feel you are really going somewhere, and more especially if that somewhere is the North Pole. The children's feet made no noise on the ice, and they went on and on in a beautiful white silence. But suddenly the silence was shattered and a cry rang out over the snow."
"""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and he fell down at once, because it is the only way to stop. Jane fell on top of him and then they crawled on hands and knees to the snow at the edge of the slide and there was a sportsman, dressed in a peaked cap and a frozen moustache, like the one you see in the pictures about Ice-Peter, and he had a gun in his hand."
"""You don't happen to have any bullets about you?"" said he."
"""No,"" George said, truthfully. ""I had five of father's revolver cartridges, but they were taken away the day Nurse turned out my pockets to see if I had taken the knob of the bathroom door by mistake."""
"""Quite so,"" said the sportsman, ""these accidents will occur. You don't carry firearms, then, I presume?"""
"""I haven't any firearms,"" said George, ""but I have a firework. It's only a squib one of the boys gave me, if that's any good."" And he began to feel among the string and peppermints, and buttons and tops and nibs and chalk and foreign postage stamps in his knickerbocker pockets."
"""One could but try,"" the sportsman replied, and he held out his hand."
"But Jane pulled at her brother's jacket-tail and whispered, ""Ask him what he wants it for."""
"So then the sportsman had to confess that he wanted the firework to kill the white grouse with; and, when they came to look, there was the white grouse himself, sitting in the snow, looking quite pale and careworn, and waiting anxiously for the matter to be decided one way or the other."
"George put all the things back in his pockets, and said, ""No, I shan't."
"But at that moment a dark shadow fell on them, and they saw that it was a dragon exactly the size of the dining room at home."
"So then they knew that all was lost. The dragon swooped down and caught the two children in his claws; he caught Effie by her green silk sash, and Harry by the little point at the back of his Eton jacket and then, spreading his great yellow wings, he rose into the air, rattling like a third-class carriage when the brake is hard on."
"""Oh, Harry,"" said Effie, ""I wonder when he will eat us!"" The dragon was flying across woods and fields with great flaps of his wings that carried him a quarter of a mile at each flap."
"Harry and Effie could see the country below, hedges and rivers and churches and farmhouses flowing away from under them, much faster than you see them running away from the sides of the fastest express train."
"And still the dragon flew on. The children saw other dragons in the air as they went, but the dragon who was as big as the dining room never stopped to speak to any of them, but just flew on quite steadily."
"""He knows where he wants to go,"" said Harry. ""Oh, if he would only drop us before he gets there!"""
"But the dragon held on tight, and he flew and flew and flew until at last, when the children were quite giddy, he settled down, with a rattling of all his scales, on the top of a mountain. And he lay there on his great green scaly side, panting, and very much out of breath, because he had come such a long way. But his claws were fast in Effie's sash and the little point at the back of Harry's Eton jacket."
"Then Effie took out the knife Harry had given her on her birthday. It had cost only sixpence to begin with, and she had had it a month, and it never could sharpen anything but slate-pencils; but somehow she managed to make that knife cut her sash in front, and crept out of it, leaving the dragon with only a green silk bow in one of his claws. That knife would never have cut Harry's jacket-tail off, though, and when Effie had tried for some time she saw that this was so and gave it up. But with her help Harry managed to wriggle quietly out of his sleeves, so that the dragon had only an Eton jacket in his other claw. Then the children crept on tiptoe to a crack in the rocks and got in. It was much too narrow for the dragon to get in also, so they stayed in there and waited to make faces at the dragon when he felt rested enough to sit up and begin to think about eating them. He was very angry, indeed, when they made faces at him, and blew out fire and smoke at them, but they ran farther into the cave so that he could not reach them, and when he was tired of blowing he went away."
"But they were afraid to come out of the cave, so they went farther in, and presently the cave opened out and grew bigger, and the floor was soft sand, and when they had come to the very end of the cave there was a door, and on it was written: UNIVERSAL TAPROOM. PRIVATE. NO ONE ALLOWED INSIDE."
"So they opened the door at once just to peep in, and then they remembered what St. George had said."
"""We can't be worse off than we are,"" said Harry, ""with a dragon waiting for us outside. Let's go in."""
"They went boldly into the taproom, and shut the door behind them."
"And now they were in a sort of room cut out of the solid rock, and all along one side of the room were taps, and all the taps were labeled with china labels like you see in baths. And as they could both read words of two syllables or even three sometimes, they understood at once that they had gotten to the place where the weather is turned on from. There were six big taps labeled ""Sunshine,"" ""Wind,"" ""Rain,"" ""Snow,"" ""Hail,"" ""Ice,"""
"and a lot of little ones, labeled ""Fair to moderate,"" ""Showery,"" ""South breeze,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" ""Skating,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""South wind,"" ""East wind,"" and so on. And the big tap labeled ""Sunshine"" was turned full on. They could not see any sunshine the cave was lighted by a skylight of blue glass so they supposed the sunlight was pouring out by some other way, as it does with the tap that washes out the underneath parts of patent sinks in kitchens."
"Then they saw that one side of the room was just a big looking glass, and when you looked in it you could see everything that was going on in the world and all at once, too, which is not like most looking glasses."
"They saw the carts delivering the dead dragons at the County Council offices, and they saw St. George asleep under the dragonproof veil. And they saw their mother at home crying because her children had gone out in the dreadful, dangerous daylight, and she was afraid a dragon had eaten them. And they saw the whole of England, like a great puzzle map green in the field parts and brown in the towns, and black in the places where they make coal and crockery and cutlery and chemicals. All over it, on the black parts, and on the brown, and on the green, there was a network of green dragons. And they could see that it was still broad daylight, and no dragons had gone to bed yet."
"Effie said, ""Dragons do not like cold."" And she tried to turn off the sunshine, but the tap was out of order, and that was why there had been so much hot weather, and why the dragons had been able to be hatched. So they left the sunshine tap alone, and they turned on the snow and left the tap full on while they went to look in the glass. There they saw the dragons running all sorts of ways like ants if you are cruel enough to pour water into an ant-heap, which, of course, you never are. And the snow fell more and more."
"Then Effie turned the rain tap quite full on, and presently the dragons began to wriggle less, and by-and-by some of them lay quite still, so the children knew the water had put out the fires inside them, and they were dead. So then they turned on the hail only half on, for fear of breaking people's windows and after a while there were no more dragons to be seen moving."
Then the children knew that they were indeed the deliverers of their country.
"""They will put up a monument to us,"" said Harry, ""as high as Nelson's!"
"All the dragons are dead."""
"""I hope the one that was waiting outside for us is dead!"" said Effie."
"""And about the monument, Harry, I'm not so sure. What can they do with such a lot of dead dragons? It would take years and years to bury them, and they could never be burnt now they are so soaking wet. I wish the rain would wash them off into the sea."""
"But this did not happen, and the children began to feel that they had not been so frightfully clever after all."
"""I wonder what this old thing's for,"" said Harry. He had found a rusty old tap, which seemed as though it had not been used for ages. Its china label was quite coated over with dirt and cobwebs. When Effie had cleaned it with a bit of her skirt for curiously enough both the children had come out without pocket handkerchiefs she found that the label said ""Waste."""
"""Let's turn it on,"" she said. ""It might carry off the dragons."""
"The tap was very stiff from not having been used for such a long time, but together they managed to turn it on, and then ran to the mirror to see what happened."
"Already a great, round black hole had opened in the very middle of the map of England, and the sides of the map were tilting themselves up, so that the rain ran down toward the hole."
"""Oh, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"" cried Effie, and she hurried back to the taps and turned on everything that seemed wet. ""Showery,"" ""Good open weather,"" ""Nice growing weather for the crops,"" and even ""South"" and ""South-West,"" because she had heard her father say that those winds brought rain."
"And now the floods of rain were pouring down on the country, and great sheets of water flowed toward the center of the map, and cataracts of water poured into the great round hole in the middle of the map, and the dragons were being washed away and disappearing down the waste pipe in great green masses and scattered green shoals single dragons and dragons by the dozen; of all sizes, from the ones that carry off elephants down to the ones that get in your tea."
"Presently there was not a dragon left. So then they turned off the tap named ""Waste,"" and they half-turned off the one labeled ""Sunshine"" it was broken, so that they could not turn it off altogether and they turned on ""Fair to moderate"" and ""Showery"" and both taps stuck, so that they could not be turned off, which accounts for our climate."
"All at once he saw in the distance two giants, who made a sign to him with their hands, and when he came to them they said, “We are quarrelling about a cap, and which of us it is to belong to, and as we are equally strong, neither of us can get the better of the other. The small men are cleverer than we are, so we will leave the decision to thee.” “How can you dispute about an old cap?” said the youth. “Thou dost not know what properties it has! It is a wishing-cap; whosoever puts it on, can wish himself away wherever he likes, and in an instant he will be there.” “Give me the cap,” said the youth, “I will go a short distance off, and when I call you, you must run a race, and the cap shall belong to the one who gets first to me.” He put it on and went away, and thought of the King’s daughter, forgot the giants, and walked continually onward. At length he sighed from the very bottom of his heart, and cried, “Ah, if I were but at the Castle of the Golden Sun,” and hardly had the words passed his lips than he was standing on a high mountain before the gate of the castle."
"He entered and went through all the rooms, until in the last he found the King’s daughter. But how shocked he was when he saw her. She had an ashen-gray face full of wrinkles, blear eyes, and red hair. “Are you the King’s daughter, whose beauty the whole world praises?” cried he."
"“Ah,” she answered, “this is not my form; human eyes can only see me in this state of ugliness, but that thou mayst know what I am like, look in the mirror it does not let itself be misled it will show thee my image as it is in truth.” She gave him the mirror in his hand, and he saw therein the likeness of the most beautiful maiden on earth, and saw, too, how the tears were rolling down her cheeks with grief. Then said he, “How canst thou be set free? I fear no danger.” She said, “He who gets the crystal ball, and holds it before the enchanter, will destroy his power with it, and I shall resume my true shape. Ah,” she added, “so many have already gone to meet death for this, and thou art so young; I grieve that thou shouldst encounter such great danger.”"
"“Nothing can keep me from doing it,” said he, “but tell me what I must do.” “Thou shalt know everything,” said the King’s daughter; “when thou descendest the mountain on which the castle stands, a wild bull will stand below by a spring, and thou must fight with it, and if thou hast the luck to kill it, a fiery bird will spring out of it, which bears in its body a burning egg, and in the egg the crystal ball lies like a yolk. The bird will not, however, let the egg fall until forced to do so, and if it falls on the ground, it will flame up and burn everything that is near, and melt even ice itself, and with it the crystal ball, and then all thy trouble will have been in vain.”"
"The youth went down to the spring, where the bull snorted and bellowed at him. After a long struggle he plunged his sword in the animal’s body, and it fell down. Instantly a fiery bird arose from it, and was about to fly away, but the young man’s brother, the eagle, who was passing between the clouds, swooped down, hunted it away to the sea, and struck it with his beak until, in its extremity, it let the egg fall. The egg did not, however, fall into the sea, but on a fisherman’s hut which stood on the shore and the hut began at once to smoke and was about to break out in flames. Then arose in the sea waves as high as a house, they streamed over the hut, and subdued the fire. The other brother, the whale, had come swimming to them, and had driven the water up on high. When the fire was extinguished, the youth sought for the egg and happily found it; it was not yet melted, but the shell was broken by being so suddenly cooled with the water, and he could take out the crystal ball unhurt."
"When the youth went to the enchanter and held it before him, the latter said, “My power is destroyed, and from this time forth thou art the King of the Castle of the Golden Sun. With this canst thou likewise give back to thy brothers their human form.” Then the youth hastened to the King’s daughter, and when he entered the room, she was standing there in the full splendour of her beauty, and joyfully they exchanged rings with each other."
198 Maid Maleen
"There was once a King who had a son who asked in marriage the daughter of a mighty King; she was called Maid Maleen, and was very beautiful."
"As her father wished to give her to another, the prince was rejected; but as they both loved each other with all their hearts, they would not give each other up, and Maid Maleen said to her father, “I can and will take no other for my husband.” Then the King flew into a passion, and ordered a dark tower to be built, into which no ray of sunlight or moonlight should enter. When it was finished, he said, “Therein shalt thou be imprisoned for seven years, and then I will come and see if thy perverse spirit is broken.” Meat and drink for the seven years were carried into the tower, and then she and her waiting-woman were led into it and walled up, and thus cut off from the sky and from the earth. There they sat in the darkness, and knew not when day or night began. The King’s son often went round and round the tower, and called their names, but no sound from without pierced through the thick walls."
"What else could they do but lament and complain? Meanwhile the time passed, and by the diminution of the food and drink they knew that the seven years were coming to an end. They thought the moment of their deliverance was come; but no stroke of the hammer was heard, no stone fell out of the wall, and it seemed to Maid Maleen that her father had forgotten her. As they only had food for a short time longer, and saw a miserable death awaiting them, Maid Maleen said, “We must try our last chance, and see if we can break through the wall.” She took the bread-knife, and picked and bored at the mortar of a stone, and when she was tired, the waiting-maid took her turn. With great labour they succeeded in getting out one stone, and then a second, and a third, and when three days were over the first ray of light fell on their darkness, and at last the opening was so large that they could look out. The sky was blue, and a fresh breeze played on their faces; but how melancholy everything looked all around! Her father’s castle lay in ruins, the town and the villages were, so far as could be seen, destroyed by fire, the fields far and wide laid to waste, and no human being was visible. When the opening in the wall was large enough for them to slip through, the waiting-maid sprang down first, and then Maid Maleen followed. But where were they to go? The enemy had ravaged the whole kingdom, driven away the King, and slain all the inhabitants."
"They wandered forth to seek another country, but nowhere did they find a shelter, or a human being to give them a mouthful of bread, and their need was so great that they were forced to appease their hunger with nettles. When, after long journeying, they came into another country, they tried to get work everywhere; but wherever they knocked they were turned away, and no one would have pity on them. At last they arrived in a large city and went to the royal palace. There also they were ordered to go away, but at last the cook said that they might stay in the kitchen and be scullions."
"The son of the King in whose kingdom they were, was, however, the very man who had been betrothed to Maid Maleen. His father had chosen another bride for him, whose face was as ugly as her heart was wicked."
"The wedding was fixed, and the maiden had already arrived; but because of her great ugliness, however, she shut herself in her room, and allowed no one to see her, and Maid Maleen had to take her her meals from the kitchen. When the day came for the bride and the bridegroom to go to church, she was ashamed of her ugliness, and afraid that if she showed herself in the streets, she would be mocked and laughed at by the people. Then said she to Maid Maleen, “A great piece of luck has befallen thee. I have sprained my foot, and cannot well walk through the streets; thou shalt put on my wedding-clothes and take my place; a greater honour than that thou canst not have!” Maid Maleen, however, refused it, and said, “I wish for no honour which is not suitable for me.” It was in vain, too, that the bride offered her gold. At last she said angrily, “If thou dost not obey me, it shall cost thee thy life. I have but to speak the word, and thy head will lie at thy feet.” Then she was forced to obey, and put on the bride’s magnificent clothes and all her jewels. When she entered the royal hall, every one was amazed at her great beauty, and the King said to his son, “This is the bride whom I have chosen for thee, and whom thou must lead to church.” The bridegroom was astonished, and thought, “She is like my Maid Maleen, and I should believe that it was she herself, but she has long been shut up in the tower, or dead.” He took her by the hand and led her to church. On the way was a nettle-plant, and she said,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"“What art thou saying?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” He was surprised that she knew about her, but kept silence. When they came to the foot-plank into the churchyard, she said,"
"“Foot-bridge, do not break, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked the King’s son. “Nothing,” she replied, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” “Dost thou know Maid Maleen?” “No,” she answered, “how should I know her; I have only heard of her.” When they came to the church-door, she said once more,"
"“Church-door, break not, I am not the true bride.”"
"“What art thou saying there?” asked he. “Ah,” she answered, “I was only thinking of Maid Maleen.” Then he took out a precious chain, put it round her neck, and fastened the clasp. Thereupon they entered the church, and the priest joined their hands together before the altar, and married them. He led her home, but she did not speak a single word the whole way. When they got back to the royal palace, she hurried into the bride’s chamber, put off the magnificent clothes and the jewels, dressed herself in her gray gown, and kept nothing but the jewel on her neck, which she had received from the bridegroom."
"When the night came, and the bride was to be led into the prince’s apartment, she let her veil fall over her face, that he might not observe the deception. As soon as every one had gone away, he said to her, “What didst thou say to the nettle-plant which was growing by the wayside?”"
“To which nettle-plant?” asked she; “I don’t talk to nettle-plants.”
"“If thou didst not do it, then thou art not the true bride,” said he."
"So she bethought herself, and said,"
"“I must go out unto my maid, Who keeps my thoughts for me.”"
"She went out and sought Maid Maleen. “Girl, what hast thou been saying to the nettle?” “I said nothing but,"
"“Oh, nettle-plant, Little nettle-plant, What dost thou here alone?"
"I have known the time When I ate thee unboiled, When I ate thee unroasted.”"
"The bride ran back into the chamber, and said, “I know now what I said to the nettle,” and she repeated the words which she had just heard."
“But what didst thou say to the foot-bridge when we went over it?”
asked the King’s son. “To the foot-bridge?” she answered. “I don’t talk to foot-bridges.” “Then thou art not the true bride.”
"She again said,"
"said he; “and we can gnaw at a bare bone again.” “Ah,” said the woman, “I had rather not have riches if I am not to know from whom they come, for then I have no peace.”"
"The man went back to fish, and after a while he chanced to draw out the gold fish for a third time. “Listen,” said the fish, “I see very well that I am fated to fall into your hands, take me home and cut me into six pieces; give your wife two of them to eat, two to your horse and bury two of them in the ground, then they will bring you a blessing.”"
"The fisherman took the fish home with him, and did as it had bidden him. It came to pass, however, that from the two pieces that were buried in the ground two golden lilies sprang up, that the horse had two golden foals, and the fisherman’s wife bore two children who were made entirely of gold. The children grew up, became tall and handsome, and the lilies and horses grew likewise. Then they said, “Father, we want to mount our golden steeds and travel out in the world.” But he answered sorrowfully, “How shall I bear it if you go away, and I know not how it fares with you?” Then they said, “The two golden lilies remain here. By them you can see how it is with us; if they are fresh, then we are in health; if they are withered, we are ill; if they perish, then we are dead.” So they rode forth and came to an inn, in which were many people, and when they perceived the gold-children they began to laugh, and jeer. When one of them heard the mocking he felt ashamed and would not go out into the world, but turned back and went home again to his father. But the other rode forward and reached a great forest. As he was about to enter it, the people said, It is not safe for you to ride through, the wood is full of robbers who would treat you badly. You will fare ill, and when they see that you are all of gold, and your horse likewise, they will assuredly kill you.’"
"But he would not allow himself to be frightened, and said, “I must and will ride through it.” Then he took bear-skins and covered himself and his horse with them, so that the gold was no more to be seen, and rode fearlessly into the forest. When he had ridden onward a little he heard a rustling in the bushes, and heard voices speaking together. From one side came cries of, “There is one,” but from the other, “Let him go, ’tis an idle fellow, as poor and bare as a church-mouse, what should we gain from him?”"
"So the gold-child rode joyfully through the forest, and no evil befell him. One day he entered a village wherein he saw a maiden, who was so beautiful that he did not believe that any more beautiful than she existed in the world. And as such a mighty love took possession of him, he went up to her and said, “I love thee with my whole heart, wilt thou be my wife?” He, too, pleased the maiden so much that she agreed and said, “Yes, I will be thy wife, and be true to thee my whole life long.” Then they were married, and just as they were in the greatest happiness, home came the father of the bride, and when he saw that his daughter’s wedding was being celebrated, he was astonished, and said, “Where is the bridegroom?” They showed him the gold-child, who, however, still wore his bear-skins. Then the father said wrathfully, “A vagabond shall never have my daughter!” and was about to kill him. Then the bride begged as hard as she could, and said, “He is my husband, and I love him with all my heart!” until at last he allowed himself to be appeased. Nevertheless the idea never left his thoughts, so that next morning he rose early, wishing to see whether his daughter’s husband was a common ragged beggar. But when he peeped in, he saw a magnificent golden man in the bed, and the cast-off bear-skins lying on the ground."
"Then he went back and thought, “What a good thing it was that I restrained my anger! I should have committed a great crime.” But the gold-child dreamed that he rode out to hunt a splendid stag, and when he awoke in the morning, he said to his wife, “I must go out hunting.”"
"She was uneasy, and begged him to stay there, and said, “You might easily meet with a great misfortune,” but he answered, “I must and will go.”"
"Thereupon he got up, and rode forth into the forest, and it was not long before a fine stag crossed his path exactly according to his dream. He aimed and was about to shoot it, when the stag ran away. He gave chase over hedges and ditches for the whole day without feeling tired, but in the evening the stag vanished from his sight, and when the gold-child looked round him, he was standing before a little house, wherein was a witch. He knocked, and a little old woman came out and asked, “What are you doing so late in the midst of the great forest?”"
"“Have you not seen a stag?” “Yes,” answered she, “I know the stag well,” and thereupon a little dog which had come out of the house with her, barked at the man violently. “Wilt thou be silent, thou odious toad,” said he, “or I will shoot thee dead.” Then the witch cried out in a passion, “What! will you slay my little dog?” and immediately transformed him, so that he lay like a stone, and his bride awaited him in vain and thought, “That which I so greatly dreaded, which lay so heavily on my heart, has come upon him!” But at home the other brother was standing by the gold-lilies, when one of them suddenly drooped."
"“Good heavens!” said he, “my brother has met with some great misfortune! I must away to see if I can possibly rescue him.” Then the father said, “Stay here, if I lose you also, what shall I do?” But he answered, “I must and will go forth!”"
"Then he mounted his golden horse, and rode forth and entered the great forest, where his brother lay turned to stone. The old witch came out of her house and called him, wishing to entrap him also, but he did not go near her, and said, “I will shoot you, if you will not bring my brother to life again.” She touched the stone, though very unwillingly, with her forefinger, and he was immediately restored to his human shape. But the two gold-children rejoiced when they saw each other again, kissed and caressed each other, and rode away together out of the forest, the one home to his bride, and the other to his father. The father then said, “I knew well that you had rescued your brother, for the golden lily suddenly rose up and blossomed out again.” Then they lived happily, and all prospered with them until their death."
86 The Fox and the Geese
"The fox once came to a meadow in which was a flock of fine fat geese, on which he smiled and said, “I come in the nick of time, you are sitting together quite beautifully, so that I can eat you up one after the other.” The geese cackled with terror, sprang up, and began to wail and beg piteously for their lives. But the fox would listen to nothing, and said, “There is no mercy to be had! You must die.” At length one of them took heart and said, “If we poor geese are to yield up our vigorous young lives, show us the only possible favour and allow us one more prayer, that we may not die in our sins, and then we will place ourselves in a row, so that you can always pick yourself out the fattest.” “Yes,” said the fox, “that is reasonable, and a pious request. Pray away, I will wait till you are done.” Then the first began a good long prayer, for ever saying, “Ga! Ga!” and as she would make no end, the second did not wait until her turn came, but began also, “Ga! Ga!” The third and fourth followed her, and soon they were all cackling together."
"When they have done praying, the story shall be continued further, but at present they are still praying without stopping.”"
87 The Poor Man and the Rich Man
"In olden times, when the Lord himself still used to walk about on this earth amongst men, it once happened that he was tired and overtaken by the darkness before he could reach an inn. Now there stood on the road before him two houses facing each other; the one large and beautiful, the other small and poor. The large one belonged to a rich man, and the small one to a poor man."
"Then the Lord thought, “I shall be no burden to the rich man, I will stay the night with him.” When the rich man heard some one knocking at his door, he opened the window and asked the stranger what he wanted."
"The Lord answered, “I only ask for a night’s lodging.”"
"Then the rich man looked at the traveler from head to foot, and as the Lord was wearing common clothes, and did not look like one who had much money in his pocket, he shook his head, and said, “No, I cannot take you in, my rooms are full of herbs and seeds; and if I were to lodge everyone who knocked at my door, I might very soon go begging myself."
"Go somewhere else for a lodging,” and with this he shut down the window and left the Lord standing there."
"So the Lord turned his back on the rich man, and went across to the small house and knocked. He had hardly done so when the poor man opened the little door and bade the traveler come in. “Pass the night with me, it is already dark,” said he; “you cannot go any further to-night.”"
"This pleased the Lord, and he went in. The poor man’s wife shook hands with him, and welcomed him, and said he was to make himself at home and put up with what they had got; they had not much to offer him, but what they had they would give him with all their hearts. Then she put the potatoes on the fire, and while they were boiling, she milked the goat, that they might have a little milk with them. When the cloth was laid, the Lord sat down with the man and his wife, and he enjoyed their coarse food, for there were happy faces at the table. When they had had supper and it was bed-time, the woman called her husband apart and said, “Hark you, dear husband, let us make up a bed of straw for ourselves to-night, and then the poor traveler can sleep in our bed and have a good rest, for he has been walking the whole day through, and that makes one weary.” “With all my heart,” he answered, “I will go and offer it to him;” and he went to the stranger and invited him, if he had no objection, to sleep in their bed and rest his limbs properly."
"But the Lord was unwilling to take their bed from the two old folks; however, they would not be satisfied, until at length he did it and lay down in their bed, while they themselves lay on some straw on the ground."
"Next morning they got up before daybreak, and made as good a breakfast as they could for the guest. When the sun shone in through the little window, and the Lord had got up, he again ate with them, and then prepared to set out on his journey."
"But as he was standing at the door he turned round and said, “As you are so kind and good, you may wish three things for yourselves and I will grant them.” Then the man said, “What else should I wish for but eternal happiness, and that we two, as long as we live, may be healthy and have every day our daily bread; for the third wish, I do not know what to have.” And the Lord said to him, “Will you wish for a new house instead of this old one?” “Oh, yes,” said the man; “if I can have that, too, I should like it very much.” And the Lord fulfilled his wish, and changed their old house into a new one, again gave them his blessing, and went on."
"The sun was high when the rich man got up and leaned out of his window and saw, on the opposite side of the way, a new clean-looking house with red tiles and bright windows where the old hut used to be. He was very much astonished, and called his wife and said to her, “Tell me, what can have happened? Last night there was a miserable little hut standing there, and to-day there is a beautiful new house. Run over and see how that has come to pass.”"
"So his wife went and asked the poor man, and he said to her, “Yesterday evening a traveler came here and asked for a night’s lodging, and this morning when he took leave of us he granted us three wishes—eternal happiness, health during this life and our daily bread as well, and besides this, a beautiful new house instead of our old hut.”"
"When the rich man’s wife heard this, she ran back in haste and told her husband how it had happened. The man said, “I could tear myself to pieces! If I had but known that! That traveler came to our house too, and wanted to sleep here, and I sent him away.” “Quick!” said his wife, “get on your horse. You can still catch the man up, and then you must ask to have three wishes granted to you.”"
"The rich man followed the good counsel and galloped away on his horse, and soon came up with the Lord. He spoke to him softly and pleasantly, and begged him not to take it amiss that he had not let him in directly; he was looking for the front-door key, and in the meantime the stranger had gone away, if he returned the same way he must come and stay with him. “Yes,” said the Lord; “if I ever come back again, I will do so.” Then the rich man asked if might not wish for three things too, as his neighbor had done? “Yes,” said the Lord, he might, but it would not be to his advantage, and he had better not wish for anything; but the rich man thought that he could easily ask for something which would add to his happiness, if he only knew that it would be granted."
"So the Lord said to him, “Ride home, then, and three wishes which you shall form, shall be fulfilled.”"
"The rich man had now gained what he wanted, so he rode home, and began to consider what he should wish for. As he was thus thinking he let the bridle fall, and the horse began to caper about, so that he was continually disturbed in his meditations, and could not collect his thoughts at all. He patted its neck, and said, “Gently, Lisa,” but the horse only began new tricks. Then at last he was angry, and cried quite impatiently, “I wish your neck was broken!” Directly he had said the words, down the horse fell on the ground, and there it lay dead and never moved again. And thus was his first wish fulfilled. As he was miserly by nature, he did not like to leave the harness lying there; so he cut it off, and put it on his back; and now he had to go on foot. “I have still two wishes left,” said he, and comforted himself with that thought."
"And now as he was walking slowly through the sand, and the sun was burning hot at noon-day, he grew quite hot-tempered and angry. The saddle hurt his back, and he had not yet any idea what to wish for. “If I were to wish for all the riches and treasures in the world,” said he to himself, “I should still to think of all kinds of other things later on, I know that, beforehand. But I will manage so that there is nothing at all left me to wish for afterwards.” Then he sighed and said, “Ah, if I were but that Bavarian peasant, who likewise had three wishes granted to him, and knew quite well what to do, and in the first place wished for a great deal of beer, and in the second for as much beer as he was able to drink, and in the third for a barrel of beer into the bargain.”"
"The snake-king said: ""I sincerely condole with you in your calamity; the tiger-king also fully sympathises with you, and wants me to tell you so, as he cannot drag his huge body here as we have done with our small ones. The king of the rats has promised to do his best to provide you with food. We would now do what we can for your release."
"From this day we shall issue orders to our armies to oppress all the subjects of this kingdom. The deaths by snake-bite and tigers shall increase a hundredfold from this day, and day by day it shall continue to increase till your release. Whenever you hear people near you, you had better bawl out so as to be heard by them: 'The wretched prince imprisoned me on the false charge of having killed his father, while it was a tiger that killed him. From that day these calamities have broken out in his dominions. If I were released I would save all by my powers of healing poisonous wounds and by incantations.' Some one may report this to the king, and if he knows it, you will obtain your liberty."" Thus comforting his protector in trouble, he advised him to pluck up courage, and took leave of him. From that day tigers and serpents, acting under the orders of their kings, united in killing as many persons and cattle as possible. Every day people were carried away by tigers or bitten by serpents. Thus passed months and years."
"Gangazara sat in the dark cellar, without the sun's light falling upon him, and feasted upon the breadcrumbs and sweetmeats that the rats so kindly supplied him with. These delicacies had completely changed his body into a red, stout, huge, unwieldy mass of flesh. Thus passed full ten years, as prophesied in the horoscope."
"Ten complete years rolled away in close imprisonment. On the last evening of the tenth year one of the serpents got into the bed-chamber of the princess and sucked her life. She breathed her last. She was the only daughter of the king. The king at once sent for all the snake-bite curers. He promised half his kingdom and his daughter's hand to him who would restore her to life. Now a servant of the king who had several times overheard Gangazara's cries, reported the matter to him. The king at once ordered the cell to be examined. There was the man sitting in it. How had he managed to live so long in the cell?"
"Some whispered that he must be a divine being. Thus they discussed, while they brought Gangazara to the king."
The king no sooner saw Gangazara than he fell on the ground. He was struck by the majesty and grandeur of his person. His ten years'
"imprisonment in the deep cell underground had given a sort of lustre to his body. His hair had first to be cut before his face could be seen. The king begged forgiveness for his former fault, and requested him to revive his daughter."
"""Bring me within an hour all the corpses of men and cattle, dying and dead, that remain unburnt or unburied within the range of your dominions; I shall revive them all,"" were the only words that Gangazara spoke."
Cartloads of corpses of men and cattle began to come in every minute.
"Even graves, it is said, were broken open, and corpses buried a day or two before were taken out and sent for their revival. As soon as all were ready, Gangazara took a vessel full of water and sprinkled it over them all, thinking only of his snake-king and tiger-king. All rose up as if from deep slumber, and went to their respective homes."
"The princess, too, was restored to life. The joy of the king knew no bounds. He cursed the day on which he imprisoned him, blamed himself for having believed the word of a goldsmith, and offered him the hand of his daughter and the whole kingdom, instead of half, as he promised. Gangazara would not accept anything, but asked the king to assemble all his subjects in a wood near the town. ""I shall there call in all the tigers and serpents, and give them a general order."""
"When the whole town was assembled, just at the dusk of evening, Gangazara sat dumb for a moment, and thought upon the Tiger King and the Serpent King, who came with all their armies. People began to take to their heels at the sight of tigers. Gangazara assured them of safety, and stopped them."
"The grey light of the evening, the pumpkin colour of Gangazara, the holy ashes scattered lavishly over his body, the tigers and snakes humbling themselves at his feet, gave him the true majesty of the god Gangazara. For who else by a single word could thus command vast armies of tigers and serpents, said some among the people. ""Care not for it; it may be by magic. That is not a great thing. That he revived cartloads of corpses shows him to be surely Gangazara,"" said others."
"""Why should you, my children, thus trouble these poor subjects of Ujjaini? Reply to me, and henceforth desist from your ravages."" Thus said the Soothsayer's son, and the following reply came from the king of the tigers: ""Why should this base king imprison your honour, believing the mere word of a goldsmith that your honour killed his father? All the hunters told him that his father was carried away by a tiger. I was the messenger of death sent to deal the blow on his neck."
"I did it, and gave the crown to your honour. The prince makes no inquiry, and at once imprisons your honour. How can we expect justice from such a stupid king as that? Unless he adopt a better standard of justice we will go on with our destruction."""
"The king heard, cursed the day on which he believed in the word of a goldsmith, beat his head, tore his hair, wept and wailed for his crime, asked a thousand pardons, and swore to rule in a just way from that day. The serpent-king and tiger-king also promised to observe their oath as long as justice prevailed, and took their leave. The goldsmith fled for his life. He was caught by the soldiers of the king, and was pardoned by the generous Gangazara, whose voice now reigned supreme. All returned to their homes."
The king again pressed Gangazara to accept the hand of his daughter.
"He agreed to do so, not then, but some time afterwards. He wished to go and see his elder brother first, and then to return and marry the princess. The king agreed; and Gangazara left the city that very day on his way home."
"It so happened that unwittingly he took a wrong road, and had to pass near a sea-coast. His elder brother was also on his way up to Benares by that very same route. They met and recognised each other, even at a distance. They flew into each other's arms. Both remained still for a time almost unconscious with joy. The pleasure of Gangazara was so great that he died of joy."
"The elder brother was a devout worshipper of Ganesa. That was a Friday, a day very sacred to that god. The elder brother took the corpse to the nearest Ganesa temple and called upon him. The god came, and asked him what he wanted. ""My poor brother is dead and gone; and this is his corpse. Kindly keep it in your charge till I finish worshipping you. If I leave it anywhere else the devils may snatch it away when I am absent worshipping you; after finishing the rites I shall burn him."" Thus said the elder brother, and, giving the corpse to the god Ganesa, he went to prepare himself for that deity's ceremonials. Ganesa made over the corpse to his Ganas, asking them to watch over it carefully. But instead of that they devoured it."
"The elder brother, after finishing the puja, demanded his brother's corpse of the god. The god called his Ganas, who came to the front blinking, and fearing the anger of their master. The god was greatly enraged. The elder brother was very angry. When the corpse was not forthcoming he cuttingly remarked, ""Is this, after all, the return for my deep belief in you? You are unable even to return my brother's corpse."" Ganesa was much ashamed at the remark. So he, by his divine power, gave him a living Gangazara instead of the dead corpse. Thus was the second son of the Soothsayer restored to life."
"The brothers had a long talk about each other's adventures. They both went to Ujjaini, where Gangazara married the princess, and succeeded to the throne of that kingdom. He reigned for a long time, conferring several benefits upon his brother. And so the horoscope was fully fulfilled."
Harisarman
"There was a certain Brahman in a certain village, named Harisarman. He was poor and foolish and in evil case for want of employment, and he had very many children, that he might reap the fruit of his misdeeds in a former life. He wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta. His sons became keepers of Sthuladatta's cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an attendant. One day there was a feast on account of the marriage of the daughter of Sthuladatta, largely attended by many friends of the bridegroom, and merry-makers. Harisarman hoped that he would be able to fill himself up to the throat with ghee and flesh and other dainties, and get the same for his family, in the house of his patron."
"While he was anxiously expecting to be fed, no one thought of him."
"Then he was distressed at getting nothing to eat, and he said to his wife at night, ""It is owing to my poverty and stupidity that I am treated with such disrespect here; so I will pretend by means of an artifice to possess a knowledge of magic, so that I may become an object of respect to this Sthuladatta; so, when you get an opportunity, tell him that I possess magical knowledge."" He said this to her, and after turning the matter over in his mind, while people were asleep he took away from the house of Sthuladatta a horse on which his master's son-in-law rode. He placed it in concealment at some distance, and in the morning the friends of the bridegroom could not find the horse, though they searched in every direction. Then, while Sthuladatta was distressed at the evil omen, and searching for the thieves who had carried off the horse, the wife of Harisarman came and said to him, ""My husband is a wise man, skilled in astrology and magical sciences; he can get the horse back for you; why do you not ask him?"" When Sthuladatta heard that, he called Harisarman, who said, ""Yesterday I was forgotten, but to-day, now the horse is stolen, I am called to mind,"" and Sthuladatta then propitiated the Brahman with these words ""I forgot you, forgive me"" and asked him to tell him who had taken away their horse. Then Harisarman drew all kinds of pretended diagrams, and said: ""The horse has been placed by thieves on the boundary line south from this place. It is concealed there, and before it is carried off to a distance, as it will be at close of day, go quickly and bring it."" When they heard that, many men ran and brought the horse quickly, praising the discernment of Harisarman."
"Then Harisarman was honoured by all men as a sage, and dwelt there in happiness, honoured by Sthuladatta."
"Now, as days went on, much treasure, both of gold and jewels, had been stolen by a thief from the palace of the king. As the thief was not known, the king quickly summoned Harisarman on account of his reputation for knowledge of magic. And he, when summoned, tried to gain time, and said, ""I will tell you to-morrow,"" and then he was placed in a chamber by the king, and carefully guarded. And he was sad because he had pretended to have knowledge. Now in that palace there was a maid named Jihva (which means Tongue), who, with the assistance of her brother, had stolen that treasure from the interior of the palace. She, being alarmed at Harisarman's knowledge, went at night and applied her ear to the door of that chamber in order to find out what he was about. And Harisarman, who was alone inside, was at that very moment blaming his own tongue, that had made a vain assumption of knowledge. He said: ""O Tongue, what is this that you have done through your greediness? Wicked one, you will soon receive punishment in full."" When Jihva heard this, she thought, in her terror, that she had been discovered by this wise man, and she managed to get in where he was, and falling at his feet, she said to the supposed wizard:"
"""Brahman, here I am, that Jihva whom you have discovered to be the thief of the treasure, and after I took it I buried it in the earth in a garden behind the palace, under a pomegranate tree. So spare me, and receive the small quantity of gold which is in my possession."""
"When Harisarman heard that, he said to her proudly: ""Depart, I know all this; I know the past, present and future; but I will not denounce you, being a miserable creature that has implored my protection. But whatever gold is in your possession you must give back to me."" When he said this to the maid, she consented, and departed quickly. But Harisarman reflected in his astonishment: ""Fate brings about, as if in sport, things impossible, for when calamity was so near, who would have thought chance would have brought us success? While I was blaming my jihva, the thief Jihva suddenly flung herself at my feet. Secret crimes manifest themselves by means of fear."" Thus thinking, he passed the night happily in the chamber. And in the morning he brought the king, by some skilful parade of pretended knowledge into the garden, and led him up to the treasure, which was buried under the pomegranate tree, and said that the thief had escaped with a part of it. Then the king was pleased, and gave him the revenue of many villages."
"While she was seeking, she saw the old woman and how she was stealing away, and wanting to get off with a bird-cage which she had in her hand. So she went after her and took the cage out of her hand, and when she raised it up and looked into it, a bird was inside which had the plain ring in its bill. Then she took the ring, and ran quite joyously home with it, and thought the little white dove would come and get the ring, but it did not. Then she leant against a tree and determined to wait for the dove, and, as she thus stood, it seemed just as if the tree was soft and pliant, and was letting its branches down. And suddenly the branches twined around her, and were two arms, and when she looked round, the tree was a handsome man, who embraced and kissed her heartily, and said, “Thou hast delivered me from the power of the old woman, who is a wicked witch. She had changed me into a tree, and every day for two hours I was a white dove, and so long as she possessed the ring I could not regain my human form.” Then his servants and his horses, who had likewise been changed into trees, were freed from the enchantment also, and stood beside him. And he led them forth to his kingdom, for he was a King’s son, and they married, and lived happily."
124 The Three Brothers
"There was once a man who had three sons, and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived. Now each of the sons wished to have the house after his father’s death; but the father loved them all alike, and did not know what to do; he did not wish to sell the house, because it had belonged to his forefathers, else he might have divided the money amongst them. At last a plan came into his head, and he said to his sons, “Go into the world, and try each of you to learn a trade, and, when you all come back, he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house.”"
"The sons were well content with this, and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. They fixed a time when they should all come home again, and then each went his way."
"It chanced that they all found skilful masters, who taught them their trades well. The blacksmith had to shoe the King’s horses, and he thought to himself, “The house is mine, without doubt.” The barber only shaved great people, and he too already looked upon the house as his own. The fencing-master got many a blow, but he only bit his lip, and let nothing vex him; “for,” said he to himself, “If you are afraid of a blow, you’ll never win the house.”"
"When the appointed time had gone by, the three brothers came back home to their father; but they did not know how to find the best opportunity for showing their skill, so they sat down and consulted together. As they were sitting thus, all at once a hare came running across the field. “Ah, ha, just in time!” said the barber. So he took his basin and soap, and lathered away until the hare came up; then he soaped and shaved off the hare’s whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed, and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body."
"“Well done!” said the old man. “Your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully, or the house will be yours.”"
"Soon after, up came a nobleman in his coach, dashing along at full speed. “Now you shall see what I can do, father,” said the blacksmith; so away he ran after the coach, took all four shoes off the feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping, and put him on four new shoes without stopping him. “You are a fine fellow, and as clever as your brother,” said his father; “I do not know to which I ought to give the house.”"
"Then the third son said, “Father, let me have my turn, if you please;”"
"and, as it was beginning to rain, he drew his sword, and flourished it backwards and forwards above his head so fast that not a drop fell upon him. It rained still harder and harder, till at last it came down in torrents; but he only flourished his sword faster and faster, and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house. When his father saw this he was amazed, and said, “This is the master-piece, the house is yours!”"
"His brothers were satisfied with this, as was agreed beforehand; and, as they loved one another very much, they all three stayed together in the house, followed their trades, and, as they had learnt them so well and were so clever, they earned a great deal of money. Thus they lived together happily until they grew old; and at last, when one of them fell sick and died, the two others grieved so sorely about it that they also fell ill, and soon after died. And because they had been so clever, and had loved one another so much, they were all laid in the same grave."
125 The Devil and his Grandmother
"There was a great war, and the King had many soldiers, but gave them small pay, so small that they could not live upon it, so three of them agreed among themselves to desert. One of them said to the others, “If we are caught we shall be hanged on the gallows; how shall we manage it?” Another said, “Look at that great cornfield, if we were to hide ourselves there, no one could find us; the troops are not allowed to enter it, and to-morrow they are to march away.” They crept into the corn, only the troops did not march away, but remained lying all round about it. They stayed in the corn for two days and two nights, and were so hungry that they all but died, but if they had come out, their death would have been certain. Then said they, “What is the use of our deserting if we have to perish miserably here?” But now a fiery dragon came flying through the air, and it came down to them, and asked why they had concealed themselves there? They answered, “We are three soldiers who have deserted because the pay was so bad, and now we shall have to die of hunger if we stay here, or to dangle on the gallows if we go out.” “If you will serve me for seven years,” said the dragon, “I will convey you through the army so that no one shall seize you.” “We have no choice and are compelled to accept,” they replied. Then the dragon caught hold of them with his claws, and carried them away through the air over the army, and put them down again on the earth far from it; but the dragon was no other than the Devil. He gave them a small whip and said, “Whip with it and crack it, and then as much gold will spring up round about as you can wish for; then you can live like great lords, keep horses, and drive your carriages, but when the seven years have come to an end, you are my property.” Then he put before them a book which they were all three forced to sign. “I will, however, then set you a riddle,” said he, “and if you can guess that, you shall be free, and released from my power.” Then the dragon flew away from them, and they went away with their whip, had gold in plenty, ordered themselves rich apparel, and travelled about the world. Wherever they were they lived in pleasure and magnificence, rode on horseback, drove in carriages, ate and drank, but did nothing wicked. The time slipped quickly away, and when the seven years were coming to an end, two of them were terribly anxious and alarmed; but the third took the affair easily, and said, “Brothers, fear nothing, my head is sharp enough, I shall guess the riddle.” They went out into the open country and sat down, and the two pulled sorrowful faces. Then an aged woman came up to them who inquired why they were so sad? “Alas!” said they, “how can that concern you? After all, you cannot help us.” “Who knows?” said she. “Confide your trouble to me.” So they told her that they had been the Devil’s servants for nearly seven years, and that he had provided them with gold as plentifully as if it had been blackberries, but that they had sold themselves to him, and were forfeited to him, if at the end of the seven years they could not guess a riddle. The old woman said, “If you are to be saved, one of you must go into the forest, there he will come to a fallen rock which looks like a little house, he must enter that, and then he will obtain help.” The two melancholy ones thought to themselves, “That will still not save us,” and stayed where they were, but the third, the merry one, got up and walked on in the forest until he found the rock-house. In the little house, however, a very aged woman was sitting, who was the Devil’s grandmother, and asked the soldier where he came from, and what he wanted there? He told her everything that had happened, and as he pleased her well, she had pity on him, and said she would help him. She lifted up a great stone which lay above a cellar, and said, “Conceal thyself there, thou canst hear everything that is said here; only sit still, and do not stir. When the dragon comes, I will question him about the riddle, he tells everything to me, so listen carefully to his answer.” At twelve o’clock at night, the dragon came flying thither, and asked for his dinner. The grandmother laid the table, and served up food and drink, so that he was pleased, and they ate and drank together. In the course of conversation, she asked him what kind of a day he had had, and how many souls he had got? “Nothing went very well to-day,” he answered, “but I have laid hold of three soldiers, I have them safe.” “Indeed! three soldiers, that’s something like, but they may escape you yet.” The Devil said mockingly, “They are mine! I will set them a riddle, which they will never in this world be able to guess!” “What riddle is that?”"
"she inquired. “I will tell you. In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish, that shall be your roast meat, and the rib of a whale shall be your silver spoon, and a hollow old horse’s hoof shall be your wine-glass.” When the Devil had gone to bed, the old grandmother raised up the stone, and let out the soldier. “Hast thou paid particular attention to everything?” “Yes,” said he, “I know enough, and will contrive to save myself.” Then he had to go back another way, through the window, secretly and with all speed to his companions. He told them how the Devil had been overreached by the old grandmother, and how he had learned the answer to the riddle from him. Then they were all joyous, and of good cheer, and took the whip and whipped so much gold for themselves that it ran all over the ground. When the seven years had fully gone by, the Devil came with the book, showed the signatures, and said, “I will take you with me to hell. There you shall have a meal! If you can guess what kind of roast meat you will have to eat, you shall be free and released from your bargain, and may keep the whip as well.” Then the first soldier began and said, “In the great North Sea lies a dead dog-fish, that no doubt is the roast meat.” The Devil was angry, and began to mutter, “Hm! hm! hm!” And asked the second, “But what will your spoon be?” “The rib of a whale, that is to be our silver spoon.” The Devil made a wry face, again growled, “Hm! hm! hm!”"
"and said to the third, “And do you also know what your wine-glass is to be?” “An old horse’s hoof is to be our wineglass.” Then the Devil flew away with a loud cry, and had no more power over them, but the three kept the whip, whipped as much money for themselves with it as they wanted, and lived happily to their end."
126 Ferdinand the Faithful
"Once on a time lived a man and a woman who so long as they were rich had no children, but when they were poor they had a little boy. They could, however, find no godfather for him, so the man said he would just go to another place to see if he could get one there. As he went, a poor man met him, who asked him where he was going. He said he was going to see if he could get a godfather, that he was poor, so no one would stand as godfather for him. “Oh,” said the poor man, “you are poor, and I am poor; I will be godfather for you, but I am so ill off I can give the child nothing. Go home and tell the nurse that she is to come to the church with the child.”"
"When they all got to the church together, the beggar was already there, and he gave the child the name of Ferdinand the Faithful."
"When he was going out of the church, the beggar said, “Now go home, I can give you nothing, and you likewise ought to give me nothing.” But he gave a key to the nurse, and told her when she got home she was to give it to the father, who was to take care of it until the child was fourteen years old, and then he was to go on the heath where there was a castle which the key would fit, and that all which was therein should belong to him. Now when the child was seven years old and had grown very big, he once went to play with some other boys, and each of them boasted that he had got more from his godfather than the other; but the child could say nothing, and was vexed, and went home and said to his father, “Did I get nothing at all, then, from my godfather?” “Oh, yes,”"
"said the father, “thou hadst a key if there is a castle standing on the heath, just go to it and open it.” Then the boy went thither, but no castle was to be seen, or heard of."
"After seven years more, when he was fourteen years old, he again went thither, and there stood the castle. When he had opened it, there was nothing within but a horse, a white one. Then the boy was so full of joy because he had a horse, that he mounted on it and galloped back to his father. “Now I have a white horse, and I will travel,” said he. So he set out, and as he was on his way, a pen was lying on the road. At first he thought he would pick it up, but then again he thought to himself, “Thou shouldst leave it lying there; thou wilt easily find a pen where thou art going, if thou hast need of one.” As he was thus riding away, a voice called after him, “Ferdinand the Faithful, take it with thee.” He looked around, but saw no one, then he went back again and picked it up. When he had ridden a little way farther, he passed by a lake, and a fish was lying on the bank, gasping and panting for breath, so he said, “Wait, my dear fish, I will help thee get into the water,” and he took hold of it by the tail, and threw it into the lake."
"Then the fish put its head out of the water and said, “As thou hast helped me out of the mud I will give thee a flute; when thou art in any need, play on it, and then I will help thee, and if ever thou lettest anything fall in the water, just play and I will reach it out to thee.”"
"Then he rode away, and there came to him a man who asked him where he was going. “Oh, to the next place.” Then what his name was? “Ferdinand the Faithful.” “So! then we have got almost the same name, I am called Ferdinand the Unfaithful.” And they both set out to the inn in the nearest place."
"Now it was unfortunate that Ferdinand the Unfaithful knew everything that the other had ever thought and everything he was about to do; he knew it by means of all kinds of wicked arts. There was, however, in the inn an honest girl, who had a bright face and behaved very prettily. She fell in love with Ferdinand the Faithful because he was a handsome man, and she asked him whither he was going. “Oh, I am just travelling round about,” said he. Then she said he ought to stay there, for the King of that country wanted an attendant or an outrider, and he ought to enter his service. He answered he could not very well go to any one like that and offer himself. Then said the maiden, “Oh, but I will soon do that for you.” And so she went straight to the King, and told him that she knew of an excellent servant for him. He was well pleased with that, and had Ferdinand the Faithful brought to him, and wanted to make him his servant. He, however, liked better to be an outrider, for where his horse was, there he also wanted to be, so the King made him an outrider. When Ferdinand the Unfaithful learnt that, he said to the girl, “What! Dost thou help him and not me?” “Oh,” said the girl, “I will help thee too.” She thought, “I must keep friends with that man, for he is not to be trusted.” She went to the King, and offered him as a servant, and the King was willing."
"Now when the King met his lords in the morning, he always lamented and said, “Oh, if I had but my love with me.” Ferdinand the Unfaithful was, however, always hostile to Ferdinand the Faithful. So once, when the King was complaining thus, he said, “You have the outrider, send him away to get her, and if he does not do it, his head must be struck off.” Then the King sent for Ferdinand the Faithful, and told him that there was, in this place or in that place, a girl he loved, and that he was to bring her to him, and if he did not do it he should die."
"Ferdinand the Faithful went into the stable to his white horse, and complained and lamented, “Oh, what an unhappy man I am!” Then someone behind him cried, “Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?” He looked round but saw no one, and went on lamenting; “Oh, my dear little white horse, now must I leave thee; now must I die.” Then some one cried once more, “Ferdinand the Faithful, why weepest thou?” Then for the first time he was aware that it was his little white horse who was putting that question. “Dost thou speak, my little white horse; canst thou do that?” And again, he said, “I am to go to this place and to that, and am to bring the bride; canst thou tell me how I am to set about it?”"
"Then answered the little white horse, “Go thou to the King, and say if he will give thou what thou must have, thou wilt get her for him. If he will give thee a ship full of meat, and a ship full of bread, it will succeed. Great giants dwell on the lake, and if thou takest no meat with thee for them, they will tear thee to pieces, and there are the large birds which would pick the eyes out of thy head if thou hadst no bread for them.” Then the King made all the butchers in the land kill, and all the bakers bake, that the ships might be filled. When they were full, the little white horse said to Ferdinand the Faithful, “Now mount me, and go with me into the ship, and then when the giants come, say,"
"“Peace, peace, my dear little giants, I have had thought of ye, Something I have brought for ye;”"
"and when the birds come, thou shalt again say,"
"“Peace, peace, my dear little birds, I have had thought of ye, Something I have brought for ye;”"
"then they will do nothing to thee, and when thou comest to the castle, the giants will help thee. Then go up to the castle, and take a couple of giants with thee. There the princess lies sleeping; thou must, however, not awaken her, but the giants must lift her up, and carry her in her bed to the ship.” And now everything took place as the little white horse had said, and Ferdinand the Faithful gave the giants and the birds what he had brought with him for them, and that made the giants willing, and they carried the princess in her bed to the King."
"And when she came to the King, she said she could not live, she must have her writings, they had been left in her castle. Then by the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, Ferdinand the Faithful was called, and the King told him he must fetch the writings from the castle, or he should die. Then he went once more into the stable, and bemoaned himself and said, “Oh, my dear little white horse, now I am to go away again, how am I to do it?” Then the little white horse said he was just to load the ships full again. So it happened again as it had happened before, and the giants and the birds were satisfied, and made gentle by the meat. When they came to the castle, the white horse told Ferdinand the Faithful that he must go in, and that on the table in the princess’s bed-room lay the writings. And Ferdinand the Faithful went in, and fetched them. When they were on the lake, he let his pen fall into the water; then said the white horse, “Now I cannot help thee at all.” But he remembered his flute, and began to play on it, and the fish came with the pen in its mouth, and gave it to him. So he took the writings to the castle, where the wedding was celebrated."
"When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one morning to Snow-white, “Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the whole summer.” “Where are you going, then, dear bear?” asked Snow-white. “I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves, does not easily see daylight again.”"
"Snow-white was quite sorry for his going away, and as she unbolted the door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the trees."
"A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest to get fire-wood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping backwards and forwards like a dog tied to a rope, and did not know what to do."
"He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried, “Why do you stand there? Can you not come here and help me?” “What are you about there, little man?” asked Rose-red. “You stupid, prying goose!”"
"answered the dwarf; “I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking. The little bit of food that one of us wants gets burnt up directly with thick logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished; but the wretched wood was too smooth and suddenly sprang asunder, and the tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white beard; so now it is tight in and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek, milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!”"
"The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it was caught too fast. “I will run and fetch some one,” said Rose-red."
"“You senseless goose!” snarled the dwarf; “why should you fetch some one? You are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?” “Don’t be impatient,” said Snow-white, “I will help you,” and she pulled her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard."
"As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it up, grumbling to himself, “Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine beard. Bad luck to you!” and then he swung the bag upon his back, and went off without even once looking at the children."
"Some time after that Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in."
"They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. “Where are you going?” said Rose-red; “you surely don’t want to go into the water?” “I am not such a fool!” cried the dwarf; “don’t you see that the accursed fish wants to pull me in?” The little man had been sitting there fishing, and unluckily the wind had twisted his beard with the fishing-line; just then a big fish bit, and the feeble creature had not strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the dwarf towards him."
"He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of little good, he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water."
"The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast together. Nothing was left but to bring out the scissors and cut the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that he screamed out, “Is that civil, you toad-stool, to disfigure one’s face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people."
"I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!” Then he took out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without saying a word more he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone."
"It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn here and there. Now they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a rock not far off. Directly afterwards they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance the dwarf, and was going to carry him off."
"The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man, and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go."
"As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried with his shrill voice, “Could you not have done it more carefully! You dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you helpless clumsy creatures!” Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by this time were used to his thanklessness, went on their way and did their business in the town."
"As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot, and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with all colors so beautifully that the children stood still and looked at them. “Why do you stand gaping there?” cried the dwarf, and his ashen-gray face became copper-red with rage. He was going on with his bad words when a loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not get to his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart he cried, “Dear Mr. Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures; look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!” The bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single blow with his paw, and he did not move again."
"The girls had run away, but the bear called to them, “Snow-white and Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.” Then they knew his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly his bearskin fell off, and he stood there, a handsome man, clothed all in gold. “I am a King’s son,” he said, “and I was bewitched by that wicked dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest as a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his well-deserved punishment.”"
"Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful roses, white and red."
162 The Wise Servant
"How fortunate is the master, and how well all goes in his house, when he has a wise servant who listens to his orders and does not obey them, but prefers following his own wisdom. A clever John of this kind was once sent out by his master to seek a lost cow. He stayed away a long time, and the master thought, “Faithful John does not spare any pains over his work!” As, however, he did not come back at all, the master was afraid lest some misfortune had befallen him, and set out himself to look for him. He had to search a long time, but at last he perceived the boy who was running up and down a large field. “Now, dear John,”"
"said the master when he had got up to him, “hast thou found the cow which I sent thee to seek?” “No, master,” he answered, “I have not found the cow, but then I have not looked for it.” “Then what hast thou looked for, John?” “Something better, and that luckily I have found.”"
"“What is that, John?” “Three blackbirds,” answered the boy. “And where are they?” asked the master. “I see one of them, I hear the other, and I am running after the third,” answered the wise boy."
"Take example by this, do not trouble yourselves about your masters or their orders, but rather do what comes into your head and pleases you, and then you will act just as wisely as prudent John."
163 The Glass Coffin
"Let no one ever say that a poor tailor cannot do great things and win high honors; all that is needed is that he should go to the right smithy, and what is of most consequence, that he should have good luck."
"A civil, adroit tailor’s apprentice once went out travelling, and came into a great forest, and, as he did not know the way, he lost himself."
"Night fell, and nothing was left for him to do, but to seek a bed in this painful solitude. He might certainly have found a good bed on the soft moss, but the fear of wild beasts let him have no rest there, and at last he was forced to make up his mind to spend the night in a tree."
"He sought out a high oak, climbed up to the top of it, and thanked God that he had his goose with him, for otherwise the wind which blew over the top of the tree would have carried him away."
"After he had spent some hours in the darkness, not without fear and trembling, he saw at a very short distance the glimmer of a light, and as he thought that a human habitation might be there, where he would be better off than on the branches of a tree, he got carefully down and went towards the light. It guided him to a small hut that was woven together of reeds and rushes. He knocked boldly, the door opened, and by the light which came forth he saw a little hoary old man who wore a coat made of bits of colored stuff sewn together. “Who are you, and what do you want?” asked the man in a grumbling voice. “I am a poor tailor,” he answered, “whom night has surprised here in the wilderness, and I earnestly beg you to take me into your hut until morning.” “Go your way,” replied the old man in a surly voice, “I will have nothing to do with runagates; seek for yourself a shelter elsewhere.” After these words he was about to slip into his hut again, but the tailor held him so tightly by the corner of his coat, and pleaded so piteously, that the old man, who was not so ill-natured as he wished to appear, was at last softened, and took him into the hut with him where he gave him something to eat, and then pointed out to him a very good bed in a corner."
"The weary tailor needed no rocking; but slept sweetly till morning, but even then would not have thought of getting up, if he had not been aroused by a great noise. A violent sound of screaming and roaring forced its way through the thin walls of the hut. The tailor, full of unwonted courage, jumped up, put his clothes on in haste, and hurried out. Then close by the hut, he saw a great black bull and a beautiful stag, which were just preparing for a violent struggle. They rushed at each other with such extreme rage that the ground shook with their trampling, and the air resounded with their cries. For a long time it was uncertain which of the two would gain the victory; at length the stag thrust his horns into his adversary’s body, whereupon the bull fell to the earth with a terrific roar, and was thoroughly despatched by a few strokes from the stag."
"The tailor, who had watched the fight with astonishment, was still standing there motionless, when the stag in full career bounded up to him, and before he could escape, caught him up on his great horns. He had not much time to collect his thoughts, for it went in a swift race over stock and stone, mountain and valley, wood and meadow. He held with both hands to the tops of the horns, and resigned himself to his fate. It seemed, however, to him just as if he were flying away. At length the stag stopped in front of a wall of rock, and gently let the tailor down. The tailor, more dead than alive, required a longer time than that to come to himself. When he had in some degree recovered, the stag, which had remained standing by him, pushed its horns with such force against a door which was in the rock, that it sprang open. Flames of fire shot forth, after which followed a great smoke, which hid the stag from his sight. The tailor did not know what to do, or whither to turn, in order to get out of this desert and back to human beings again. Whilst he was standing thus undecided, a voice sounded out of the rock, which cried to him, “Enter without fear, no evil shall befall you thee.” He hesitated, but driven by a mysterious force, he obeyed the voice and went through the iron-door into a large spacious hall, whose ceiling, walls and floor were made of shining polished square stones, on each of which were cut letters which were unknown to him. He looked at everything full of admiration, and was on the point of going out again, when he once more heard the voice which said to him, “Step on the stone which lies in the middle of the hall, and great good fortune awaits thee.”"
"“Sew me the seam, Draw me the thread, Spread it over with pitch, Knock the nail on the head.”"
"The shoemaker, however, could not endure a joke; he pulled a face as if he had drunk vinegar, and made a gesture as if he were about to seize the tailor by the throat. But the little fellow began to laugh, reached him his bottle, and said, “No harm was meant, take a drink, and swallow your anger down.” The shoemaker took a very hearty drink, and the storm on his face began to clear away. He gave the bottle back to the tailor, and said, “I spoke civilly to you; one speaks well after much drinking, but not after much thirst. Shall we travel together?” “All right,”"
"answered the tailor, “if only it suits you to go into a big town where there is no lack of work.” “That is just where I want to go,” answered the shoemaker. “In a small nest there is nothing to earn, and in the country, people like to go barefoot.” They travelled therefore onwards together, and always set one foot before the other like a weasel in the snow."
"Both of them had time enough, but little to bite and to break. When they reached a town they went about and paid their respects to the tradesmen, and because the tailor looked so lively and merry, and had such pretty red cheeks, every one gave him work willingly, and when luck was good the master’s daughters gave him a kiss beneath the porch, as well. When he again fell in with the shoemaker, the tailor had always the most in his bundle. The ill-tempered shoemaker made a wry face, and thought, “The greater the rascal the more the luck,” but the tailor began to laugh and to sing, and shared all he got with his comrade. If a couple of pence jingled in his pockets, he ordered good cheer, and thumped the table in his joy till the glasses danced, and it was lightly come, lightly go, with him."
"When they had travelled for some time, they came to a great forest through which passed the road to the capital. Two foot-paths, however, led through it, one of which was a seven days’ journey, and the other only two, but neither of the travellers knew which way was the short one. They seated themselves beneath an oak-tree, and took counsel together how they should forecast, and for how many days they should provide themselves with bread. The shoemaker said, “One must look before one leaps, I will take with me bread for a week.” “What!” said the tailor, “drag bread for seven days on one’s back like a beast of burden, and not be able to look about. I shall trust in God, and not trouble myself about anything! The money I have in my pocket is as good in summer as in winter, but in hot weather bread gets dry, and mouldy into the bargain; even my coat does not go as far as it might. Besides, why should we not find the right way? Bread for two days, and that’s enough.” Each, therefore, bought his own bread, and then they tried their luck in the forest."
"It was as quiet there as in a church. No wind stirred, no brook murmured, no bird sang, and through the thickly-leaved branches no sunbeam forced its way. The shoemaker spoke never a word, the heavy bread weighed down his back until the perspiration streamed down his cross and gloomy face. The tailor, however, was quite merry, he jumped about, whistled on a leaf, or sang a song, and thought to himself, “God in heaven must be pleased to see me so happy.”"
"This lasted two days, but on the third the forest would not come to an end, and the tailor had eaten up all his bread, so after all his heart sank down a yard deeper. In the meantime he did not lose courage, but relied on God and on his luck. On the third day he lay down in the evening hungry under a tree, and rose again next morning hungry still; so also passed the fourth day, and when the shoemaker seated himself on a fallen tree and devoured his dinner, the tailor was only a looker-on."
"If he begged for a little piece of bread the other laughed mockingly, and said, “Thou hast always been so merry, now thou canst try for once what it is to be sad: the birds which sing too early in the morning are struck by the hawk in the evening,” In short he was pitiless. But on the fifth morning the poor tailor could no longer stand up, and was hardly able to utter one word for weakness; his cheeks were white, and his eyes red. Then the shoemaker said to him, “I will give thee a bit of bread to-day, but in return for it, I will put out thy right eye.”"
"The unhappy tailor who still wished to save his life, could not do it in any other way; he wept once more with both eyes, and then held them out, and the shoemaker, who had a heart of stone, put out his right eye with a sharp knife. The tailor called to remembrance what his mother had formerly said to him when he had been eating secretly in the pantry. “Eat what one can, and suffer what one must.” When he had consumed his dearly-bought bread, he got on his legs again, forgot his misery and comforted himself with the thought that he could always see enough with one eye. But on the sixth day, hunger made itself felt again, and gnawed him almost to the heart. In the evening he fell down by a tree, and on the seventh morning he could not raise himself up for faintness, and death was close at hand. Then said the shoemaker, “I will show mercy and give thee bread once more, but thou shalt not have it for nothing, I shall put out thy other eye for it.” And now the tailor felt how thoughtless his life had been, prayed to God for forgiveness, and said, “Do what thou wilt, I will bear what I must, but remember that our Lord God does not always look on passively, and that an hour will come when the evil deed which thou hast done to me, and which I have not deserved of thee, will be requited. When times were good with me, I shared what I had with thee. My trade is of that kind that each stitch must always be exactly like the other. If I no longer have my eyes and can sew no more I must go a-begging. At any rate do not leave me here alone when I am blind, or I shall die of hunger.” The shoemaker, however, who had driven God out of his heart, took the knife and put out his left eye. Then he gave him a bit of bread to eat, held out a stick to him, and drew him on behind him."
"When the sun went down, they got out of the forest, and before them in the open country stood the gallows. Thither the shoemaker guided the blind tailor, and then left him alone and went his way. Weariness, pain, and hunger made the wretched man fall asleep, and he slept the whole night. When day dawned he awoke, but knew not where he lay. Two poor sinners were hanging on the gallows, and a crow sat on the head of each of them. Then one of the men who had been hanged began to speak, and said, “Brother, art thou awake?” “Yes, I am awake,” answered the second. “Then I will tell thee something,” said the first; “the dew which this night has fallen down over us from the gallows, gives every one who washes himself with it his eyes again. If blind people did but know this, how many would regain their sight who do not believe that to be possible.”"
"When the tailor heard that, he took his pocket-handkerchief, pressed it on the grass, and when it was moist with dew, washed the sockets of his eyes with it. Immediately was fulfilled what the man on the gallows had said, and a couple of healthy new eyes filled the sockets. It was not long before the tailor saw the sun rise behind the mountains; in the plain before him lay the great royal city with its magnificent gates and hundred towers, and the golden balls and crosses which were on the spires began to shine. He could distinguish every leaf on the trees, saw the birds which flew past, and the midges which danced in the air."
"He took a needle out of his pocket, and as he could thread it as well as ever he had done, his heart danced with delight. He threw himself on his knees, thanked God for the mercy he had shown him, and said his morning prayer. He did not forget also to pray for the poor sinners who were hanging there swinging against each other in the wind like the pendulums of clocks. Then he took his bundle on his back and soon forgot the pain of heart he had endured, and went on his way singing and whistling."
"The first thing he met was a brown foal running about the fields at large. He caught it by the mane, and wanted to spring on it and ride into the town. The foal, however, begged to be set free. “I am still too young,” it said, “even a light tailor such as thou art would break my back in two let me go till I have grown strong. A time may perhaps come when I may reward thee for it.” “Run off,” said the tailor, “I see thou art still a giddy thing.” He gave it a touch with a switch over its back, whereupon it kicked up its hind legs for joy, leapt over hedges and ditches, and galloped away into the open country."
"But the little tailor had eaten nothing since the day before. “The sun to be sure fills my eyes,” said he, “but the bread does not fill my mouth. The first thing that comes across me and is even half edible will have to suffer for it.” In the meantime a stork stepped solemnly over the meadow towards him. “Halt, halt!” cried the tailor, and seized him by the leg. “I don’t know if thou art good to eat or not, but my hunger leaves me no great choice. I must cut thy head off, and roast thee.” “Don’t do that,” replied the stork; “I am a sacred bird which brings mankind great profit, and no one does me an injury. Leave me my life, and I may do thee good in some other way.” “Well, be off, Cousin Longlegs,” said the tailor. The stork rose up, let its long legs hang down, and flew gently away."
"“What’s to be the end of this?” said the tailor to himself at last, “my hunger grows greater and greater, and my stomach more and more empty."
"Whatsoever comes in my way now is lost.” At this moment he saw a couple of young ducks which were on a pond come swimming towards him. “You come just at the right moment,” said he, and laid hold of one of them and was about to wring its neck. On this an old duck which was hidden among the reeds, began to scream loudly, and swam to him with open beak, and begged him urgently to spare her dear children. “Canst thou not imagine,” said she, “how thy mother would mourn if any one wanted to carry thee off, and give thee thy finishing stroke?” “Only be quiet,” said the good-tempered tailor, “thou shalt keep thy children,”"
and put the prisoner back into the water.
"When he turned round, he was standing in front of an old tree which was partly hollow, and saw some wild bees flying in and out of it. “There I shall at once find the reward of my good deed,” said the tailor, “the honey will refresh me.” But the Queen-bee came out, threatened him and said, “If thou touchest my people, and destroyest my nest, our stings shall pierce thy skin like ten thousand red-hot needles. But if thou wilt leave us in peace and go thy way, we will do thee a service for it another time.”"
"The little tailor saw that here also nothing was to be done. “Three dishes empty and nothing on the fourth is a bad dinner!” He dragged himself therefore with his starved-out stomach into the town, and as it was just striking twelve, all was ready-cooked for him in the inn, and he was able to sit down at once to dinner. When he was satisfied he said, “Now I will get to work.” He went round the town, sought a master, and soon found a good situation. As, however, he had thoroughly learnt his trade, it was not long before he became famous, and every one wanted to have his new coat made by the little tailor, whose importance increased daily. “I can go no further in skill,” said he, “and yet things improve every day.” At last the King appointed him court-tailor."
"But how things do happen in the world! On the very same day his former comrade the shoemaker also became court-shoemaker. When the latter caught sight of the tailor, and saw that he had once more two healthy eyes, his conscience troubled him. “Before he takes revenge on me,”"
"thought he to himself, “I must dig a pit for him.” He, however, who digs a pit for another, falls into it himself. In the evening when work was over and it had grown dusk, he stole to the King and said, “Lord King, the tailor is an arrogant fellow and has boasted that he will get the gold crown back again which was lost in ancient times.” “That would please me very much,” said the King, and he caused the tailor to be brought before him next morning, and ordered him to get the crown back again, or to leave the town for ever. “Oho!” thought the tailor, “a rogue gives more than he has got. If the surly King wants me to do what can be done by no one, I will not wait till morning, but will go out of the town at once, to-day.” He packed up his bundle, therefore, but when he was without the gate he could not help being sorry to give up his good fortune, and turn his back on the town in which all had gone so well with him. He came to the pond where he had made the acquaintance of the ducks; at that very moment the old one whose young ones he had spared, was sitting there by the shore, pluming herself with her beak."
"She knew him again instantly, and asked why he was hanging his head so?"
"“Thou wilt not be surprised when thou hearest what has befallen me,”"
"replied the tailor, and told her his fate. “If that be all,” said the duck, “we can help thee. The crown fell into the water, and lies down below at the bottom; we will soon bring it up again for thee. In the meantime just spread out thy handkerchief on the bank.” She dived down with her twelve young ones, and in five minutes she was up again and sat with the crown resting on her wings, and the twelve young ones were swimming round about and had put their beaks under it, and were helping to carry it. They swam to the shore and put the crown on the handkerchief. No one can imagine how magnificent the crown was; when the sun shone on it, it gleamed like a hundred thousand carbuncles. The tailor tied his handkerchief together by the four corners, and carried it to the King, who was full of joy, and put a gold chain round the tailor’s neck."
"When the shoemaker saw that one stroke had failed, he contrived a second, and went to the King and said, “Lord King, the tailor has become insolent again; he boasts that he will copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertains to it, loose or fast, inside and out.” The King sent for the tailor and ordered him to copy in wax the whole of the royal palace, with everything that pertained to it, movable or immovable, within and without, and if he did not succeed in doing this, or if so much as one nail on the wall were wanting, he should be imprisoned for his whole life under ground."
"The tailor thought, “It gets worse and worse! No one can endure that?”"
"and threw his bundle on his back, and went forth. When he came to the hollow tree, he sat down and hung his head. The bees came flying out, and the Queen-bee asked him if he had a stiff neck, since he held his head so awry? “Alas, no,” answered the tailor, “something quite different weighs me down,” and he told her what the King had demanded of him. The bees began to buzz and hum amongst themselves, and the Queen-bee said, “Just go home again, but come back to-morrow at this time, and bring a large sheet with you, and then all will be well.” So he turned back again, but the bees flew to the royal palace and straight into it through the open windows, crept round about into every corner, and inspected everything most carefully. Then they hurried back and modelled the palace in wax with such rapidity that any one looking on would have thought it was growing before his eyes. By the evening all was ready, and when the tailor came next morning, the whole of the splendid building was there, and not one nail in the wall or tile of the roof was wanting, and it was delicate withal, and white as snow, and smelt sweet as honey. The tailor wrapped it carefully in his cloth and took it to the King, who could not admire it enough, placed it in his largest hall, and in return for it presented the tailor with a large stone house."
"The shoemaker, however, did not give up, but went for the third time to the King and said, “Lord King, it has come to the tailor’s ears that no water will spring up in the court-yard of the castle, and he has boasted that it shall rise up in the midst of the court-yard to a man’s height and be clear as crystal.” Then the King ordered the tailor to be brought before him and said, “If a stream of water does not rise in my court-yard by to-morrow as thou hast promised, the executioner shall in that very place make thee shorter by the head.” The poor tailor did not take long to think about it, but hurried out to the gate, and because this time it was a matter of life and death to him, tears rolled down his face. Whilst he was thus going forth full of sorrow, the foal to which he had formerly given its liberty, and which had now become a beautiful chestnut horse, came leaping towards him. “The time has come,” it said to the tailor, “when I can repay thee for thy good deed."
"I know already what is needful to thee, but thou shalt soon have help; get on me, my back can carry two such as thou.” The tailor’s courage came back to him; he jumped up in one bound, and the horse went full speed into the town, and right up to the court-yard of the castle. It galloped as quick as lightning thrice round it, and at the third time it fell violently down. At the same instant, however, there was a terrific clap of thunder, a fragment of earth in the middle of the court-yard sprang like a cannon-ball into the air, and over the castle, and directly after it a jet of water rose as high as a man on horseback, and the water was as pure as crystal, and the sunbeams began to dance on it. When the King saw that he arose in amazement, and went and embraced the tailor in the sight of all men."
"But good fortune did not last long. The King had daughters in plenty, one still prettier than the other, but he had no son. So the malicious shoemaker betook himself for the fourth time to the King, and said, “Lord King, the tailor has not given up his arrogance. He has now boasted that if he liked, he could cause a son to be brought to the Lord king through the air.” The King commanded the tailor to be summoned, and said, “If thou causest a son to be brought to me within nine days, thou shalt have my eldest daughter to wife.” “The reward is indeed great,” thought the little tailor; “one would willingly do something for it, but the cherries grow too high for me, if I climb for them, the bough will break beneath me, and I shall fall.”"
"He went home, seated himself cross-legged on his work-table, and thought over what was to be done. “It can’t be managed,” cried he at last, “I will go away; after all I can’t live in peace here.” He tied up his bundle and hurried away to the gate. When he got to the meadow, he perceived his old friend the stork, who was walking backwards and forwards like a philosopher. Sometimes he stood still, took a frog into close consideration, and at length swallowed it down. The stork came to him and greeted him. “I see,” he began, “that thou hast thy pack on thy back. Why art thou leaving the town?” The tailor told him what the King had required of him, and how he could not perform it, and lamented his misfortune. “Don’t let thy hair grow grey about that,” said the stork, “I will help thee out of thy difficulty. For a long time now, I have carried the children in swaddling-clothes into the town, so for once in a way I can fetch a little prince out of the well. Go home and be easy."
"In nine days from this time repair to the royal palace, and there will I come.” The little tailor went home, and at the appointed time was at the castle. It was not long before the stork came flying thither and tapped at the window. The tailor opened it, and cousin Longlegs came carefully in, and walked with solemn steps over the smooth marble pavement. He had, moreover, a baby in his beak that was as lovely as an angel, and stretched out its little hands to the Queen. The stork laid it in her lap, and she caressed it and kissed it, and was beside herself with delight. Before the stork flew away, he took his travelling bag off his back and handed it over to the Queen. In it there were little paper parcels with colored sweetmeats, and they were divided amongst the little princesses. The eldest, however, had none of them, but got the merry tailor for a husband. “It seems to me,” said he, “just as if I had won the highest prize. My mother was if right after all, she always said that whoever trusts in God and only has good luck, can never fail.”"

fulfilling a promise made to them when Volume I of the series was
issued.
A word of explanation will be found as an introduction to each

A new and important series of some of the best popular novels which have
"Myself when Young, did eagerly frequent"
"Garage and Club, and heard Great Argument"
"About it and about,—yet evermore"
Came out more Addled than when in I went.
"Indeed, with my big Car I’ve run so long"
It seems to me there’s Always something Wrong;
"Faulty Ignition, or a Blown Out Shoe,"
Or maybe the Compression is too Strong.
Then to the Laughing Face that lurks behind
"The Veil, I lifted up mine Eyes to find"
"Two pouting Lips, demurely murmuring,"
“I don’t see why you Ever bought This Kind!”

"Indeed, I’ve learned to treat it as a Joke"
"When Nuts work loose, or Carburetors choke;"
"And then, and then—the Spring, and then the Belt,"
"A Punctured Tire, or Change-Speed Lever broke!"
"A Look of Anguish underneath the Car,"
"Another Start,—a Squeak,—a Grunt,—a Jar!"
The Aspiration Pipe is working loose!
The Vapor can’t get out! And there you are!
For I remember Stopping by the Way
Waste not your Hour nor in the Vain pursuit
Of Demonstrators who will loud Dispute;
"“This one is Best, because it’s painted Red!”"
"“That One, because it has a Louder Toot!”"
"’Tis only a Beginner, young and green,"
Who Thinks he wants an Odorless Machine;
"What Fragrance is to Rose or Violet,"
So to the Motor-Car is Gasolene.
"Some advocate Gear-Driven Cars, and Some"
Sigh for a Jockey-pulley yet to come;
"Oh, crank your Car, and let the old thing Go!"
Nor heed the Brake upon your Sprocket Drum.
"’Tis but a Toy on which one spends a Pile,"
And Brags about it for a Little While;
Ambition rises—and the Foolish Man
"Sighs, and prepares to buy Another Style."

I do not know those Makes. I’ll hunt them up.

A treachery adorable;
So smiles the siren where the sea
Sings to the unforgetting shell.
"Your fleeting Leonardo face,"
"Parisian Monna Lisa, dreams"
"Elusively, but not of streams"
Born in a shadow-haunted place.
"Of Paris, Paris, is your thought,"
"Of Paris robes, and when to wear"
The latest bonnet you have bought
To match the marvel of your hair.
"Yet that fine malice of your smile,"
That faint and fluctuating glint
"Between your eyelids, does it hint"
Alone of matters mercantile?
"Close lips that keep the secret in,"
"Half spoken by the stealthy eyes,"
"Is there indeed no word to win,"
"No secret, from the vague replies"
"Where they came from, they were called androids--synthetic men,"
conditioned by their masters to complete their deadly purpose on Earth
as advance agents for an invasion from space.

"The big problem was to figure out a way to appeal to the mindless,"

he had made so far had ended in failure and time was running out--for

including every reference necessary to enable the searcher to find what
"he wishes without delay or confusion, the mistake of overloading the"
index with useless entries.
"Use ink, as pencil entries often become illegible."
"Write plainly, and do not try to economize space in preparing the copy."
DEFINITION OF TERMS
"=Subject=: includes events, places, persons, facts, definitions or"
"topics: e.g., _Boston, 7_; _Bonnet, Father, 155_; _Huron Mission,"
"plans for, 129_; _Onontio, meaning of, 102_; _Absolutism, contest with"
"liberty, 274._"
=Heading=: the word or words used by the indexer to express the subject
"or idea. In the examples above, the headings are _Boston_, _Bonnet_,"
"_Father_, _Onontio_, etc."
"=Entry=: the amplification of the Heading, with the addition of the"
"supplementary phrase. In the example above, the entry is _Absolutism,"
"contest with liberty_, the supplementary phrase being _contest with"
liberty_.
"=Cross-reference=: a heading referring to an entry: e.g., _Michabou._"
See _Manabozho_.
PROCEDURE
"Having settled upon a definite plan, the indexer seats himself at a"
"writing _France, Isle de_; _Man, Isle of_; _Wight, Isle of_:"
"e.g., _Cod, Cape_; _George, Lake_; _Washington, Mt._; _Moultrie,"
Fort_; but _Cape Breton Island_. When the name of a fort becomes
"the name of a city, of course the inversion must be abandoned, as"
_Fort Wayne_.
"Forenames are to be used in the form employed by their owners,"
"however unusual, as _Will Carleton, Sally (Pratt) McLean, Hans"
"Droysen, Fritz Reuter_."
Give names of places in the English form. (Cross-reference from
"the vernacular, if necessary): e.g., _Munich_ not _Muenchen_ or"
"_München_, _Vienna_ not _Wien_, _Austria_ not _Oesterreich_."
But if both the English and the foreign forms are used by English
"writers, prefer the foreign form: e.g., _Dauphiné_ rather than"
_Dauphiny_.
Use the modern name of a city and cross-reference to it from the
"ancient, provided its existence has been continuous and there is"
no doubt as to the identity.
Distinctive epithets are to be in the same language as the name:
"e.g.,"
"_Kniaz, fürst von, Freiherr zu, duc de Magenta, Bishop of Lincoln,"
"évêque de Meaux_; but _Emperor of Germany, King of France_, not"
"_kaiser_ and _roi_, when names of sovereign princes are given in"
English. Treat in the same way patronymics habitually joined with a
"person's name; as, _Clemens Alexandrinus_."
THE ORDOVICIAN AND SILURIAN
[Footnote: Often known as the Lower Silurian.]
THE ORDOVICIAN
In North America the Ordovician rocks lie conformably on the
"Cambrian. The two periods, therefore, were not parted by any"
"deformation, either of mountain making or of continental uplift."
The general submergence which marked the Cambrian continued into
the succeeding period with little interruption.
"SUBDIVISIONS AND DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Ordovician series, as"
"they have been made out in New York, are given for reference in"
"the following table, with the rocks of which they are chiefly"
composed:
5 Hudson . . . . . . . . shales
4 Utica  . . . . . . . . shales
3 Trenton  . . . . . . . limestones
2 Chazy  . . . . . . . . limestones
1 Calciferous  . . . . . sandy limestones
These marine formations of the Ordovician outcrop about the
"Cambrian and pre-Cambrian areas, and, as borings show, extend far"
and wide over the interior of the continent beneath more recent
strata. The Ordovician sea stretched from Appalachia across the
"Mississippi valley. It seems to have extended to California,"
although broken probably by several mountainous islands in the
west.
"One bright delirious moment’s space,"
And then she passed: I followed slow
"Across the heath, and up and round,"
And watched the splendid death of day
"Upon the summits far away,"
And in her fateful beauty found
The fierce wild beauty of the light
"That startles twilight on the hills,"
"And lightens all the mountain rills,"
And flames before the feet of night.
IN THE ORATORY.
"THE incense mounted like a cloud,"
A golden cloud of languid scent;
"Robed priests before the altar bowed,"
Expecting the divine event.
"Then silence, like a prisoner bound,"
"Rose, by a mighty hand set free,"
"And dazzlingly, in shafts of sound,"
Thundered Beethoven’s Mass in C.
She knelt in prayer; large lids serene
"Lay heavy on the sombre eyes,"
As though to veil some vision seen

"Type sizes in the present day are determined by the point system, the"
fundamental unit of which is the point. This is obtained by dividing
"a length of 13⅘ inches into 996 equal parts, each one being called a"
point. One point is therefore .0138 of an inch or 72.46 points are
equal to 1 inch.
"For purposes of convenience, a point is expressed as being 1/72 of an"
"inch. Thus 6-point type occupies 6/72 of an inch of space, 12-point"
"12/72 and so on. This does not mean, however, that the actual printed"
"face occupies six points on the paper, but that it is six points from"
the base to the top of the body carrying the face.

fermented malt and juniper berries. Gin differs from the other alcoholic

Rum is made from a fermented solution of molasses by distillation. It

GERTRUDE ATHERTON was born in San Francisco and received her
"early education in California and Kentucky, but her best"
"training was in her grandfather’s library, a collection, it is"
"said, of English masterpieces only, containing no American"
fiction whatever. Yet Mrs. Atherton is as thorough an American
"as a niece, in the third generation, of Benjamin Franklin should"
be.
It seems to have been the English critics who first recognised
"her originality, power, intensity, vividness, and vitality, but"
"from her first book, “What Dreams May Come,” published in 1888,"
her writings have revealed the unusual combination of brains and
"feeling. This gives her work both keen, clever strength and"
"brilliancy of colour, developed through years of hard work, many"
"of which were spent abroad, and reaching their best"
"manifestation in her latest fiction, the one quality in “The"
Conqueror” and the other in “The Splendid Idle Forties.” Both of
"these books go to prove the foresight of Mr. Harold Frederic,"

INTRODUCTION

HALF-TITLE
"The half-title ordinarily consists of a single line, standing by"
itself on the first page of the leaf immediately preceding the first
"page of the text, and carries the title of the book as at the top of"
the first page of text. It is frequently confused with the bastard or
"false-title, which always precedes the title-page. Half-titles may also"
"run through the book before various divisions, but the bastard-title"
never moves from its one position at the beginning of the volume.
LIMIT NOTICE
"If an edition be limited in number, the notice of such limit should be"
placed either on the page facing the bastard-title or on the reverse of
the bastard-title.

CHAPTER XXIII.
AN ORATOR'S RIVAL.
"The House was crowded, and every gallery full. Lady Eynesford and"
"Eleanor Scaife, attended by Captain Heseltine, occupied their appointed"
seats; the members of the Legislative Council overflowed from their
proper pen and mingled with humbler folk in the public galleries;
"reporters wrote furiously, and an endless line of boys bearing their"
slips came and went. The great hour had arrived: the battle-field was
reached at last. Sir Robert Perry sat and smiled; Puttock played with
the hair chain that wandered across his broad waistcoat; Coxon
"restlessly bit his nails; Norburn's face was pale with excitement, and"
he twisted his hands in his lap; the determined partisans cheered or
groaned; the waverers looked important and felt unhappy; all eyes were
"steadily fixed on the Premier, and all ears intent on his words."
For the moment he had forgotten everything but the fight he was
"fighting. No thought of the wretched Benham, who lay dead, no thought of"
"his daughter, who watched him as he spoke, no thought of Alicia"
"Derosne, who stayed away that she might not see him, crossed his brain"
"history of the Low Countries, some have a special and general scientific"
interest. Among these is the research of M. Alphonse Wauters on _Les
"libertés communales_ (Bruxelles, 1878). Barante's _Histoire des Ducs de"
Bourgogne_ (4th ed. 1838-40) contains much interesting matter on the
"Burgundian period. The assiduous research of M. Lefèvre Pontalis, _Jean"
"de Witt, Grand Pensionnaire de Hollande_ (2 tom. 1884; Eng. trans. 2"
"vols.), throws a full light on one of the most critical periods of Dutch"
history.
"Dutch works on the history of the Low Countries in general, and the"
"United Provinces in particular, are many and voluminous; indeed, no"
history has been more amply written. The good general history of the
"Netherlands by N.G. van Kampen, which appeared in German in the series"
"of Heeren and Uckert (1831-33), is only partially superseded by the"
"_Geschichte der Niederlande_ of Wenzelburger (Bd. i, 1879; ii, 1886),"
which is not completed. But the most readable general history of the
"Netherlands yet produced is that of P.J. Blok, _Geschiedenis van het"
"Nederlandsche Volk_ (1892, etc.), of which there is a competent but"
"unfortunately abridged English translation (Putnams, vol. i, 1898)."
"Standard modern Dutch works are those of J.A. Vijnne, _Geschiedenis van"
"het Vaderland_, and J. van Lennep, _De Geschiedenis van Nederland_. For"
Belgian history in particular the authorities are similarly numerous.
"The _Manuel de l'histoire de Belgique_, by J. David (Louvain, 1847),"
"will be found a good handbook of authorities, episodes, and chronology,"
though without any sociological element. The _Histoire de Belgique_ of
"Th. Juste (Bruxelles, 1895, 3 tom. 4to) is comprehensive, but disfigured"
by insupportable illustrations.

influence over me. But I have lately learned how a fair face may

"looking through the SEMBLANCE of Body, then I know that the beauty I"
"SEEM to behold is mere Appearance, and not Reality. Hence, unless your"
"beautiful Duchess be like the 'King's daughter' of David's psalm, 'all"

5. Hymns of the Bohemian Brethren.
"The followers of John Hus who came to be known as the Bohemian Brethren,"
"and later as the Moravians, were the first Protestant group to introduce"
congregational singing into their worship. They also published the first
"Protestant hymnbooks, one in 1501 and another in 1505, containing 89 and"
"400 hymns, respectively, in their native Bohemian tongue. Their efforts"
to introduce congregational singing were sternly opposed by the Roman
hierarchy. The Council of Constance condemned Hus to be burned at the
"stake and warned his successor, Jacob of Misi, to cease the singing of"
hymns in the churches. It decreed:
"If laymen are forbidden to preach and interpret the Scriptures, much"
more are they forbidden to sing publicly in the churches.
"As a result of their persecution, the Brethren in 1508 sent out"
messengers to search for true Christian people into whose communion they
"might apply for admission—one to Russia, one to Greece, one to Bulgaria,"
and one to Palestine and Egypt. All returned unsuccessful. No such
"Christians had been found. They therefore remained in their own country,"
giving themselves assiduously to the translation and printing of the
Bible.
In 1522 the Brethren sent two messengers to Luther to greet him and ask
his advice. Luther became interested in them and welcomed their
fellowship. He was impressed with the hymnbook the Brethren had
"published, and later used some of the hymns in his own work."
COPYRIGHT
On the reverse of the title-page is ordinarily placed the copyright
"notice of the volume,[46] usually a little above the center, set in"
"caps and small caps, or in small caps alone. At the foot of this same"
page the printer usually places his imprint.[47]
DEDICATION
"The dedication is a page set in the monumental style, generally in"
"small capitals. This must always be a right-hand page, and the reverse"
must always be blank.
PREFACE
Ordinarily the preface is set in the same size of type as the body. If
"it is written by some one other than the author, it is frequently set"
in italic to mark the distinction. This is particularly true in case
the book contains an introduction as well. If the preface is of unusual
"importance, it is sometimes customary to have it set in type one size"
"larger than the body, or double-leaded."
TABLE OF CONTENTS
After the preface and before the list of illustrations comes the

CHAPTER VI.
HOW TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN THE EFFECT OF THE STORY.
WE are now coming to the most important part of the question of
"Story-Telling, to which all the foregoing remarks have been gradually"
"leading, and that is the Effects of these stories upon the child, apart"
"from the dramatic joy he experiences in listening to them, which would"
"in itself be quite enough to justify us in the telling. But, since I"
have urged upon teachers the extreme importance of giving so much time
to the manner of telling and of bestowing so much care on the selection
"of the material, it is right that they should expect some permanent"
"results, or else those who are not satisfied with the mere enjoyment of"
the children will seek other methods of appeal--and it is to them that
I most specially dedicate this chapter.
"I think we are on the threshold of the re-discovery of an old truth,"
"that the Dramatic Presentation is the quickest and surest, because"
it is the only one with which memory plays no tricks. If a thing has
and turned her five cards face upwards.
"""No, Jack, it's because I've won,--three aces and a pair."""
"The Sheriff shot one glance at the girl, keen, searching. Then, without"
"so much as the twitch of an eyelid, he accepted his defeat, took a cigar"
"from his pocket and lit it, the flame of the match revealing no"
"expression other than the nonchalance for which he was noted; then,"
picking up his hat and coat he walked slowly to the door. Here he halted
and wished her a polite good-night--so ceremoniously polite that at any
other time it would have compelled her admiration.
"Pale as death and almost on the point of collapse, the Girl staggered"
"back to the table where the wounded road agent was half-sitting,"
half-lying.
Thrusting her hand now into the stocking from which she had obtained the
"winning, if incriminating, cards, she drew forth those that remained and"
"scattered them in the air, crying out hysterically:"
"""Three aces an' a pair an' a stockin' full o' pictures--but his life"
"belongs to me!"""

"Conscious-stricken at the fraud that she had imposed upon the gambler,"
the Girl lived a lifetime in the moments that followed his departure.
With her face buried in her hands she stood lost in contemplation of her
"But now science has learned a new wisdom, to look only at what it can"
"see, to leave vain imaginings to children and idealists, certain always"
that the truth is inconceivably more beautiful than any dream.
"Science with us has gained her freedom, but the soul is still in bonds."
Only in Buddhism has this soul-freedom been partly gained. How beautiful
"this is, how full of great thoughts, how very different to the barren"
"materialism it has often been said to be, I have tried to show."
I believe myself that in this teaching of the laws of righteousness we
"have the grandest conception, the greatest wisdom, the world has known."
I believe that in accepting this conception we are opening to ourselves
"a new world of unimaginable progress, in justice, in charity, in"
"sympathy, and in love."
"I believe that as our minds, when freed from their bonds, have grown"
"more and more rapidly to heights of thought before undreamed of, to"
"truths eternal, to beauty inexpressible, so shall our souls, when freed,"
"as our minds now are, rise to sublimities of which now we have no"
conception.
"Let each man but open his eyes and see, and his own soul shall teach him"
marvellous things.

ADMINISTRATION OF MEDICINES
The following methods of administering medicines in order of their
"rapidity of absorption, beginning with the method by which absorption is"
"most rapid, and following with those by which absorption is less rapid"
"and finally least rapid: 1. Intravenous, by injection into veins. 2. By"
"inhalation (volatile drugs). 3. Subcutaneous, by injection into"
"subcutaneous tissue. 4. Intratracheal, by injection into the trachea (or"
"wind pipe). 5. Oral, by the mouth. 6. Rectal, by the rectum. 7."
"Inunction, by the skin. 8. Intramammary injections."
WHEN MEDICINES SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED
"The curative effects of medicines may be restrained, changed in form or"
prevented by untimely administration.
Medicines intended to act on the mucous membrane of the stomach should
only be given when that organ is empty. If distant parts are to be
affected in the most prompt and efficient manner and the medicine is

the five thousand tons vessel literally cut the luckless submarine in
twain. For a brief instant the lieutenant caught sight of the
"after-portion of the ""U"" boat, as, rendered buoyant by the trapped"
"air, it drifted past. Then amidst a smother of foam and oil the"
wreckage vanished.

coolly as if he were reckoning up the score at an athletic meeting.

A little later in the afternoon several of the ward-room officers
"were enjoying their cups of tea and biscuits, when the"

facetiously.

officer were responsible for his former discomfiture.

thirty-one thousand five hundred dollars. But it cost the Romish Church
far more than money--it cost her the loss of all the leading nations
"of the world, which had been under her dominion till that time. For"
"the expense of the vast structure, with its ""insolent opulence of"
"marbles,"" was so great that Julius II. and Leo X. were obliged to meet"
"the enormous outlay by the sale of indulgences, and that, as is well"
"known, precipitated the Reformation. So that Protestants may well feel"
a peculiar interest in this mighty cathedral.

It goes without saying that the popes would not allow the chief church
"of Roman Catholicism to go begging in the matter of relics. And, sure"
"enough, we have no sooner pushed aside the heavy padded screen and"
"stepped within than we find on our right the Chapel of the Holy Column,"
so called because it contains a pillar which is declared to have been
that against which our Lord leaned when he prayed and taught in the
"temple at Jerusalem. The pillar contains this inscription: ""Haec est"

"He led the way to his car, and was gratified to observe its salutary"
effect on Captain Dove's somewhat contemptuous demeanour. The little
"policeman in charge of it pending its opulent owner's return, came"
"forward, touching his képi, which further impressed Captain Dove,"
"uncomfortably. Slyne handed Sallie into the tonneau, and Ambrizette"
"after her, tossed the policeman a further tip which secured his"
"everlasting esteem, took his own seat at the wheel, and was hastily"
followed by Captain Dove.

"with both hands, as Slyne took the road toward Sampierdarena at a round"
pace.
"""Don't talk to the man at the wheel,"" answered Slyne, and laughed."

But when they at length reached their destination and Slyne stopped the

Suddenly a cart would come down one of these narrow streets without
"sidewalks, driving very quickly and scattering the women and children"
seated by the gutter.
In all these poor quarters there were lanes crossed by ropes loaded with
torn washing; there were wretched black shops from which an odour of
grease exhaled; there were narrow streets with mounds of garbage in the
"middle. In the very palaces, now shorn of their grandeur, appeared"
the same decoration of rags waving in the breeze. In the Theatre of

_WHAT CAN BE READ ON WALLS_
Cæsar and Kennedy went on toward the Temple of Vesta and followed the
river bank until the Tiber Embankment ended.
Here the banks were green and the river clearer and more poetic. To the
left rose the Aventine with its villas; in the harbour two or three tugs
were tied up; and here and there along the pier stood a crane. Evening
was falling and the sky was filling with pink clouds.
"They sat down awhile on the side of the road, and Cæsar entertained"
himself deciphering the inscriptions written in charcoal on a mud-wall.
would have served Philip well had Philip chosen him and trusted him. But
"as it lay in one thoroughly able man, well placed for prestige in a"
"crisis, to knit and establish a new nation, so it lay in one fanatical"
"dullard[782] to wreck half of his own empire, with the greatest captains"
of his age serving him; and to bring his fabled treasury to ruin while
his despised rebels grew rich.
"As to the vice of the Dutch constitution, the principle of the"
"supremacy of ""State rights,"" see M'Cullagh, p. 215; Motley, _Rise_,"
"pp. 794, 795 (Pt. vi, ch. ii, _end_), and _United Netherlands_, ed."
"1867, iv, 564. Wicquefort (_L'histoire des Provinces-Unies_, La"
"Haye, 1719, pp. 5, 16), following Grotius, laid stress long ago on"
"the fact that the Estates of each province recognised no superior,"
not even the entire body of the Republic. It was only the measure
of central government set up in the Burgundo-Austrian and Spanish
periods that made the Seven Provinces capable of enough united
action to repel Spanish rule during a chronic struggle of eighty
"years. Cp. Van Kampen (i, 304), who points out (p. 306) that the"
"word ""State"" first appears in Holland in the fifteenth century. It"
"arose in Flanders in the thirteenth, and in Brabant in the"
"fourteenth. Only in 1581, after some years of war, did the United"
Provinces set up a General Executive Council. In the same year the
"Prince of Orange was chosen sovereign (Motley, pp. 838, 841)."
§ 3. _The Supremacy of Dutch Commerce_
"The conquest of Flanders by Alexander of Parma, reducing its plains to"
"wolf-haunted wildernesses, and driving the great mass of the remaining"
"artisans from its ruined towns,[783] helped to consummate the prosperity"
"of the United Provinces, who took over the industry of Ghent with the"
commerce of Antwerp.[784] Getting the start of all northern Europe in
logical.”
"“Yes, certainly. And the effort to learn about useful things seems"
"natural and logical to me too, but not to learn about merely agreeable"
things. To learn medicine and mechanics is logical; but to learn to look
at a picture or to hear a symphony is an absurdity.”
“Why?”
“At any rate the neophytes that go to see a Rafael picture or to hear
"a Bach sonata and have an exclamation all ready, give me the sad"
impression of a flock of lambs. As for your sublime pedagogues of the
"Ruskin type, they seem to me to be the fine flower of priggishness, of"
"pedantry, of the most objectionable bourgeoisie.”"
“What things your brother is saying!” exclaimed Kennedy.
"“You shouldn’t notice him,” said Laura."
“Those artistic pedagogues enrage me; they remind me of Protestant
"pastors and of the friars that go around dressed like peasants, and who"
I think are called Brothers of the Christian Doctrine. The pedagogues
"are Brothers of the Esthetic Doctrine, one of the stupidest inventions"
that ever occurred to the English. I don’t know which I find more
"ridiculous, the Salvation Army or Ruskin’s books.”"
“Why have you this hatred for Ruskin?”
“I find him an idiot. I only skimmed through a book of his called _The
"Seven Lamps of Architecture_, and the first thing I read was a paragraph"
in which he said that to use an imitation diamond or any other imitation
"stone was a lie, an imposition, and a sin. I immediately said: ‘This man"
"There was also a Baluch Political Officer, known as the Sarhad-dar,"
who worked under orders from the British Political Officer at Quetta.
"The Sarhad-dar, to a certain degree, controlled the Sarhadi Raiders,"
"occasionally with the help of the Chagai Levies, which were raised by"
the Indian Government for this particular work.
Supplies were brought to these scattered posts by camel caravans from
India.
Communication with India was maintained by means of the telegraph.
Later on it became necessary to send out a wireless troop from India
to establish communication between my force at Khwash and Saindak.
At the same time I did my best to learn all I could about the tribes
"amongst whom I was going to operate, their ways and customs, and the"
nature of the country in which they lived.
A glance at the map will show the situation and boundaries of the
Sarhad--literally meaning boundary. It will be seen that it extends
"from Jalk in the East to Galugan in the West. The Eastern part, from"
"Jalk to Safed-koh, is held by a tribe known as the Gamshadzais, under"
"their notable leader, Halil Khan."
The central portion is held by the Yarmahommedzais under Jiand
"Khan, an elderly man, who has been undisputed chief, and a sort of"
"over-lord of the whole of the Sarhad, for very many years. He has"
been looked upon by his own and neighbouring tribes as well-nigh a
"demi-god. As Jiand enters later, and largely, into this narrative all"
further description of him will be reserved till actual contact is
established with him.
"Khwash--known also as Vasht or Washt--is the capital of the Sarhad,"
"a marine signal-station as well, passing ships have to be signalled"
and reported. The spell of labour varies from four to five hours or
"more. Obviously, the task is more exacting and arduous in the winter"
than in summer. During the former season the lamps have to be lighted
"as early as 3.15 p.m., and are not extinguished until eight o’clock"
"the next morning. In the summer, on the other hand, the lamps may be"
required for less than six hours or so. In northern latitudes where the
"daylight is continuous owing to the midnight sun, the light scarcely"
seems necessary. Yet it is kept burning during the scheduled hours of
darkness.
"Thus, night in and night out the whole year round, a comparatively"
small band of faithful toilers keeps alert vigil over the dangers of
"the deep, for the benefit of those who “go down to the sea in ships,"
and do their business in great waters.” The safety of thousands of
human lives and of millions sterling of merchandise is vested in
"their keeping. The resources of the shipbuilder, the staunchness of"
"the ship, the skill and knowledge of the captain--all would count for"
"nothing were it not for the persistent, steady glare of the fixed,"
"the twinkling of the occulting, or the rhythmic, monotonous turning"
"spokes of the revolving light, thrown over the waste of waters from the"
lighthouse and the lightship.

"LETTER TO THE CLEVELAND CONGRESS OF FREETHINKERS, OCTOBER, 1885."
I send my greetings to the Congress of Freethinkers assembled at
"Cleveland, and regret, more than I can express, that I am unable to"
"be there and hear all the good things you will hear, and see all the"
earnest workers you will see.
The Freethinkers of America ought to be a very proud and enthusiastic
"body, when they have in their presidential chair the ablest orator"
"of modern times, and the broadest, bravest, and most comprehensive"
"intellect that has ever been called ""Mr. President"" in this land of"
bravery and presidents. Washington was a patriot of whom we are all
justly proud. He was liberal in his religion and progressive in his
views of personal rights. And yet he had his limitations. To him liberty
"and personal rights were modified by the words, ""free, white, adult,"
"males."" He got no farther. He who fought for freedom upheld slavery! And"
yet we are all proud and glad to pay honor and respect to the memory of
Washington.
"Abraham Lincoln we place still higher on the roll of honor; for, added"
"to his still more liberal religious views, in his conceptions of freedom"
and justice he had at least two fewer limitations than had the patriot
"of 1776. He struck both ""free"" and ""white"" from his mental black list,"
and gave once more an impulse to liberty that thrilled a nation and gave
fresh dignity to the human race.
"most ""un-Spanish"" characteristic."
"It is true that, as Buckle argues, the many earthquakes in Spain"
tended to promote superstitious fear; but then on his principles
"the Dutch seafaring habits, and the constant risks and frequent"
"disasters of inundation, had the same primary tendency. For the"
"rest, the one serious oversight in Buckle's theory of Spanish"
"civilisation is his assumption (cp. 3-vol. ed. ii, 455-61; 1-vol."
"ed. p. 550) that Spanish ""loyalty"" was abnormal and continuous from"
the period of the first struggles with the Moors. As to this see
"the present writer's notes in the 1-vol. ed. of Buckle, as cited."
"Even Ferdinand, as an Aragonese, was disrespectfully treated by the"
"Castilians (cp. Armstrong as cited, pp. 5, 31, etc.; De Castro,"
"_History of Religious Intolerance in Spain_, Eng. tr. 1853, pp. 40,"
41); and Philip I and Charles V set up a new resistance. An alien
dynasty could set up disaffection in Spain as elsewhere.
"It should be noted, finally, that the stiff ceremonialism which is"
held to be the special characteristic of Spanish royalty was a
"Burgundo-Teutonic innovation, dating from Philip I, and that even"
"in the early days of Philip the Cortes petitioned ""that the"
household of the Prince Don Carlos should be arranged on the old
"Spanish lines, and not in the pompous new-fangled way of the House"
"of Burgundy"" (Major Hume's _Spain_, p. 127). Prescott (_Philip II_,"
"ed. cited, pp. 655, 659) makes the petition refer to the king's own"
"household, and shows it to have condemned the king's excessive"
"expenditure in very strong terms, saying the expense of his"
"household was ""as great as would be required for the conquest of a"
"kingdom."" At the same time the Cortes petitioned against"
"bull-fights, which appear to have originated with the Moors, were"
"strongly opposed by Isabella the Catholic, and were much encouraged"
"by the Teutonic Charles V (U.R. Burke, _History of Spain_, 1895,"
"drama and epic, lyric and sonnet.  He could speak of Poetry as one who"
had loved and courted her as a mistress.  The girl longed to ask him if
"he had written himself, but maiden shyness withheld her.  Yet her eyes"
"brightened as she talked, and the peach-like colour rose and deepened in"
"her cheeks; and Lord Sandford, turning back once again from the mother"
"to look at the daughter, was struck dumb with admiration and delight."
"""There is a rose worth winning and wearing, though the stem may not be"
"free from a sharp thorn,"" he said to himself; and Lady Romaine, who"
chanced to catch sight of Geraldine during a shifting of the admirers
"who surrounded her, gave something very like a start, and felt a curious"
thrill run through her in which pride and envy were blended.
"""Gracious!  I did not know I had so handsome a daughter!  I must wed her"
"as fast as may be, else shall I find my beaux going from me to her,"" was"
"her unspoken thought; and aloud she said, tapping Lord Sandford with her"
"fan, ""Pray tell my daughter that I am about to depart.  We have had"
"enough of the naiads and dryads, and I am tired and hungry.  Who will"
"come home with me to supper—to take pot-luck with us?"""
There was an eager clamour in response; but when the supper-party
assembled round Lady Romaine’s chocolate tables in her favourite private
"parlour, she noted that Geraldine had disappeared to bed, and that Sir"
Grey Dumaresq had not availed himself of her open invitation.

HOME ON LEAVE
"""I have several times expressed the thought that in our day the"
"feeling of patriotism is an unnatural, irrational, and harmful"
"feeling, and a cause of a great part of the ills from which mankind"
"is suffering; and that, consequently, this feeling should not be"
"cultivated, as is now being done, but should, on the contrary, be"
"suppressed and eradicated by all means available to rational men."""
(TOLSTOY.)
A change had come over us all. Instead of long spells of dreary silence
"interrupted by outbursts of irritability, by grumbling and by violent"
"quarrels over nothing, there was animated conversations and sometimes"
"even gaiety. Our talk was all about one subject--not about peace, for we"
had abandoned all hope of peace and hardly ever thought of it--but about
"leave. We had been waiting for seventeen months when, without warning, a"
leave allotment was assigned to our unit. About half a dozen men were
going every day and no one knew whose turn would come next. We were full
"of intense excitement and glad expectation, but also of anxiety in case"
something should happen to stop our leave altogether.
I made up my mind to enjoy myself thoroughly. I would see parents and
"forces along the various jutting balconies of the second floor,"
"carefully darkening all the rooms in their rear, so that, till the"
"moment of the attack itself, the assailants would have no idea that they"
were expected. It was his idea that the small doors on the garden side
"of the house, which led right and left to the servants' quarters, would"
be attacked first. He was the more assured of this because the Sergeant
"had recognised, in the bivouac of the gipsies, a man who had formerly"
been one of the royal grooms both at La Granja and at Aranjuez. He would
"be sure to be familiar, therefore, with that part of the interior of the"
"palace. Besides, being situated upon the side most completely removed"
"from the town, the assailants would have the less fear of interruption."
"While Rollo was thus cogitating, Concha came softly to his side,"
appearing out of the gloom with a suddenness that startled the young
man.
"""I have pulled up the ladder by which we ascended and laid it across the"
"balcony,"" she said. ""Was that right?"""
"""You--alone?"" cried Rollo in astonishment."
She nodded brightly.
"""Certainly,"" she answered; ""women are not all so great weaklings as you"
"think them--nor yet such fools!"""
"""Indeed, you have more sense than I,"" Rollo responded, gloomily; ""I"
"ought to have remembered that before. But, as you know, I have had many"
"things to think of."""
"""I am glad,"" she said, more quietly and submissively than ever in her"
"life, ""that even in so small a matter I am permitted to think a little"
"abdomen slightly tumid; tenderness over lower half, especially"
on left side; the lower half moves little with respiration.
Twenty-four hours later the patient had improved. He was
comfortable and hopeful; slept well with morphia 1/3 grain
"hypodermically. Tongue moist, covered with white fur; has been"
"taking milk only, [Symbol: ounce]ij every half-hour. No"
sickness. Temperature
99°. Pulse 104. Respirations 24. Abdomen flatter; general
respiratory movement; tenderness now mainly localised to an
"area 2-1/2 inches in diameter, to the left of the umbilicus,"
above exit wound.
"The patient continued to improve, and on the fifth day"
travelled six hours in a bullock wagon to Bloemfontein. Soon
"after arrival his temperature was normal: pulse 80,"
"respirations 16, with good abdominal movement. Local tenderness"
"persisted in the same area, but was less in degree. Tongue"
"rather dry, bowels confined. Micturition normal. Two drachms of"
castor oil and an enema were given.
"On the ninth day patient was practically well, except for"
slight deep tenderness. He remained in bed on ordinary light
"diet, but at the end of the third week he was seized by a"
"sudden attack of pain, the temperature rising to 103° and the"
"pulse to 140, the abdomen becoming swollen and tender. He was"
"then under the charge of Mr. Bowlby, who ordered some opium,"
and the symptoms rapidly subsided. Although this wound crossed
"the small intestine area, it is probable that the symptoms may"
have been due to an injury of the rectum or sigmoid flexure.
"difficulties, for the seaplane was rocking violently, and in spite of"
a dangerous tilt of the elevating planes was appreciably descending.
"Suddenly the frail craft plunged, literally on end, towards the sea,"
"the force of gravity, acting with the pull of the propeller, greatly"
increasing its velocity.
When within two hundred feet of the surface the seaplane made a
"complete loop, then after climbing a hundred feet or so, began to"
side-slip.
"""By Jove! He'll be drowned for a dead cert,"" exclaimed Terence, for"
he knew for a fact that the aviator had not been thrown from the

investigate a suspicious swirl in the water.
Shells were again dropping unpleasantly near to the cruiser as Aubyn
"hurried towards the boat which was, owing to being cleared for"
"action, secured inboard, abreast the after funnel."
Before he reached this spot the seaplane had struck the surface of
"the water. Falling obliquely and at a sharp angle, the impact had"
shattered one of the floats. When the cascade of spray had subsided
the wrecked craft could be seen still afloat but listing acutely. The

"Monsieur Paul Deschanel, the lion of the hour; Monsieur"
"Benjamin-Constant, always a prominent figure; Prince Roland Bonaparte,"

"jewels; and Damat, the dapper Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour."
"All diplomatic Paris was there, chattering, laughing, whispering, and"
"plotting.  Around me sounded a veritable babel of tongues, but no part"
of the function interested me.
"From time to time I saluted a man I knew, or bent over a woman's hand;"
but my thoughts were of the one woman who had so suddenly and so
forcibly returned into my life.  The representatives of the Powers of
"Europe were all present, and as they passed me by, each in his bright"
"uniform, his orders flashing on his breast and a woman on his arm, I"
asked myself which of them was actually the employer of my well-beloved.
The startling events of the day had upset me.  Had it been possible I
would have left and returned to my rooms for a quiet smoke and for calm
"reflection.  But my duty required my presence there; hence I remained,"
strolling slowly around the great crowded salon with its myriad lights
"and profuse floral decorations, until I suddenly encountered the"
"wizen-faced, toothless old Baronne de Chalencon, whose salon was one of"
"the most popular in Paris, and with whom I was on excellent terms."
"""Ah! my dear M'sieur Ingram!"" she cried, holding forth her thin, bony"
"hand laden with jewels.  ""You look tired.  Why?  No one here to-night"
"who interests you--eh?"""
"""No one save yourself, Baronne,"" I responded, bending over her hand."
"""Flatterer!"" she laughed.  ""If I were forty years younger I might accept"
be much longer than they actually were. A slight movement of the tongue
appeared to be magnified at least ten times. Clinching the fingers and
opening them again produced the feeling of their moving through a space of
several feet.']

"[Footnote 114: Horace Hutchinson, who in his _Dreams and their Meanings_"
"(1901), has independently suggested that 'this flying dream is caused by"

128) that the idea of filling the lungs as a help in levitation occurs in
the flying dreams of many persons.]

power of flight; the first part of the dream is agreeable but after the
"fall the dreamer awakes shaken, shocked, and breathless.]"
[Footnote 117: The disagreeable nature of falling in dreams may probably
be connected with the absence of rhythm usually present in dreams of
flying. Most of the psychologists who have occupied themselves with rhythm

Part II.--PROCEDURE IN PRIZE CAUSES.
"[Sidenote: Custody of ships taken as prize. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s."
16.]]
"16. Where a ship (not being a ship of war) is taken as prize, and is or"
"is brought within the jurisdiction of a prize court, she shall forthwith"
"be delivered up to the marshal of the court, or, if there is no such"
"marshal, to the principal officer of customs at the port, and shall"
"remain in his custody, subject to the orders of the court."
"[Sidenote: Bringing in of ship papers. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 17.]]"
"17.--(1) The captors shall in all cases, with all practicable speed,"
bring the ship papers into the registry of the court.
"(2) The officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"capturing ship, or some other person who was present at the capture and"
"saw the ship papers delivered up or found on board, shall make oath that"
"they are brought in as they were taken, without fraud, addition,"
"subduction, or alteration, or else shall account on oath to the"
satisfaction of the court for the absence or altered condition of the
ship papers or any of them.
(3) Where no ship papers are delivered up or found on board the captured
"ship, the officer in command, or one of the chief officers of the"
"Netherlands. ""The engrained habit of municipal isolation,"" says"
"one, ""was the cause why the general liberties of the Netherlands"
"were imperilled, why the larger part of the country was ultimately"
"ruined, and why the war of independence was conducted with so much"
"risk and difficulty, even in the face of the most serious perils"""
"(Thorold Rogers, _Holland_, p. 26. Cp. pp. 35, 43; Motley, pp. 29,"
"30, 43; Grattan, pp. 39, 50, 51). Van Kampen avows (_Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 131) that throughout the Middle Ages Friesland was"
unprogressive owing to constant feuds. Even as late as 1670 Leyden
"refused to let the Harle Maer be drained, because it would"
advantage other cities; and Amsterdam in turn opposed the reopening
of the old Rhine channel because it would make Leyden maritime
"(Temple, _Observations_, i, 130, ch. iii)."
"As regards the early factions of the ""Hooks"" and the ""Codfish"" in"
"the Dutch towns, the historic obscurity is so great that historians"
are found ascribing the names in contrary ways. Grattan (p. 49)
"represents the Hooks as the town party, and the Codfish as the"
"party of the nobles; Motley (p. 21) reverses the explanation,"
"noting, however, that there was no consistent cleavage of class or"
"of principle (cp. M'Cullagh, pp. 99, 100). This account is"
"supported by Van Kampen, i, 170, 171. The fullest survey of the"
"Hook and Cod feud is given by Wenzelburger, _Geschichte der"
"Niederlande_, i, 210-42. As to feuds of other parties in some of"
"the cities see Van Kampen, i, 172. They included, for example, a"
class feud between the rich _Vetkooper_ (fat-dealers) and the poor
"_Schieringer_ (eel-fishers). See Davies, i, 180."
"Thus dissident, and with feudal wars breaking out in every generation,"
the cities and provinces could win concessions from their feudal chiefs
"when the latter were in straits, as in the famous case of the ""Great"
"Privilege"" extorted from the Duchess Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold"
"In truth, this is the one principle which can give men guidance in the"
"tangled intricacy of modern life. It is necessary to salvation, _now_,"
"not hereafter only, to believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord"
Jesus Christ.
"For, first of all, men need to be saved from the apathy of despair."
They need some hope that there is an answer to the riddle of the
Universe. Let them once begin to feel that it _may_ be true that the
very God cares for His creatures and has made His love for them
"manifest by taking to Himself the body, mind and spirit of man, and"
"joining for ever human nature to the Godhead, then through the"
darkness comes a human voice saying--
"“O heart I made, a heart beats here!"
"Face, my hands fashioned, see it in Myself."
"Thou hast no power nor mayst conceive of mine,"
"But love I gave thee, with Myself to love,"
And thou must love Me who have died for thee.”
A man regains his self-respect when once he has escaped from the
paralyzing sense that his is only
“a life of nothings nothing worth
From that first nothing ere our birth
To that last nothing under earth.”
And there is only one starting-point for those who journey on this
quest of an answer to the enigma of life. They must resolutely abandon
the long travelled “_a priori_ road.” They must understand that the
"science of to-day is not tied to any materialistic axioms, that"
"metaphysic cannot be ignored by the physician, and that no competent"
"Captain Johnson, in his ""Lives of the Pirates,"" when Porter and his friend"
"""addressed the Pyrate, as the Queen of Sheba did Solomon, to wit, That"
"having heard of his Fame and Achievements, they had put in there to learn"
"his Art and Wisdom in the Business of pyrating, being Vessels on the same"
honourable Design with himself; and hoped with the Communication of his
"Knowledge, they should also receive his Charity, being in want of"
Necessaries for such Adventures. Roberts was won upon by the Peculiarity
"and Bluntness of these two Men and gave them Powder, Arms, and what ever"
"else they had Occasion for, spent two or three merry Nights with them, and"
"at parting, said, he hoped the L---- would Prosper their handy Works."""
"POUND, CAPTAIN THOMAS."
"On August 8th, 1689, this pirate, with five men and a boy, sailed out of"
"Boston Harbour as passengers in a small vessel. When off Lovell's Island,"
five other armed men joined them. Pound now seized the craft and took
"command, and declared his intention of going on a piratical cruise. The"
first vessel they met with they decided to take. It was a fishing boat.
"Pound ran his craft alongside, but at the last moment his heart failed"
"him, and he merely bought eight penn'o'th of mackerel from the surprised"
fishermen.
"He then sailed to Falmouth, Maine, where the corporal and soldiers of the"
guard at the fort deserted in the night and sailed off with Pound and his
"crew. Fortified by this addition to his crew, the pirate attacked a sloop,"
"the _Good Speed_, off Cape Cod, and a brigantine, the _Merrimack_, and"
"several other prizes. By this time, the Governor at Boston had heard of"
"Pound's escapades, and sent an armed sloop, the _Mary_, to search for him."
"The pirate was discovered in Tarpaulin Cove, and a fierce and bloody fight"
"took place before the pirates struck their ""Red flagg."" The prisoners were"
"cast into Boston Gaol to await their trial. Pound had been wounded, being"

converted from liquid to gaseous phase for combustion. He'd been
worrying about their pulse rating and couldn't sleep.
He'd gone on to explain that although static testing had shown they

The Indians with whom the visitor to Panama most frequently comes into
contact are those of the San Blas or Manzanillo country. These Indians
"hover curiously about the bounds of civilization, and approach without"
"actually crossing them. They are fishermen and sailors, and many of"
"their young men ship on the vessels touching at Colon, and, after"
"visiting the chief seaports of the United States, and even of France and"
"England, are swallowed up again in their tribe without affecting its"
customs to any appreciable degree. If in their wanderings they gain new
ideas or new desires they are not apparent. The man who silently offers
"you fish, fruits or vegetables from his cayuca on the beach at Colon may"
"have trod the docks at Havre or Liverpool, the levee at New Orleans or"
wandered along South Street in New York. Not a word of that can you coax

"possible words, and an air of lofty indifference. Uncas of the"

church is really growing better? Nothing of the kind. It is because the

"A few weeks after my return from Italy, while driving one afternoon"
"with a friend of mine, a lawyer of high intelligence and wide"
"information, our conversation turned to the subject of the recent death"
"of Pope Leo XIII., and from that drifted to the alleged liquefaction"
"of the blood of St. Januarius, and from that to relics in general. I"
mentioned some of the facts above stated concerning the numerous pieces

"published in one of our Southern towns, dated August 9, 1903, and"
"August 17, 1903, respectively, containing extracts from the letters of"
"a Roman Catholic bishop, the highest dignitary of his church in that"

4 Hamilton    . . . . . . shales and sandstones
3 Corniferous . . . . . . limestones
2 Oriskany    . . . . . . sandstones
1 Helderberg  . . . . . . limestones
The Helderberg is a transition epoch referred by some geologists
to the Silurian. The thin sandstones of the Oriskany mark an epoch
when waves worked over the deposits of former coastal plains. The
limestones of the Corniferous testify to a warm and clear wide sea
which extended from the Hudson to beyond the Mississippi. Corals
"throve luxuriantly, and their remains, with those of mollusks and"
"other lime-secreting animals, built up great beds of limestone."
"The bordering continents, as during the later Silurian, must now"
have been monotonous lowlands which sent down little of even the
finest waste to the sea.
In the Hamilton the clear seas of the previous epoch became
clouded with mud. The immense deposits of coarse sandstones and
"sandy shales of the Chemung, which are found off what was at the"
"time the west coast of Appalachia, prove an uplift of that ancient"
continent.
The Chemung series extends from the Catskill Mountains to
"northeastern Ohio and south to northeastern Tennessee, covering an"
area of not less than a hundred thousand square miles. In eastern
New York it attains three thousand feet in thickness; in
Pennsylvania it reaches the enormous thickness of two miles; but
it rapidly thins to the west. Everywhere the Chemung is made of
"thin beds of rapidly alternating coarse and fine sands and clays,"
"with an occasional pebble layer, and hence is a shallow-water"
deposit. The fine material has not been thoroughly winnowed from
"out and maroon Captain England, and elect himself in his place. He was a"
"villain of the deepest dye, and burnt ships and houses and tortured his"
prisoners.
"The pirates sailed down the West Coast of India from Goa to Cochin, and"
returned to Mauritius. Thence sailing to the Island of Mascarine they
"found a big Portuguese ship, which they took. In her they discovered the"
"Conde de Eviceira, Viceroy of Goa, and, even better, four million dollars"
worth of diamonds.
"Taylor, now sailing in the _Cassandra_, heard that there were four"
"men-of-war on his tracks, so he sailed to Delagoa Bay and spent the"
winter of the year 1722 there. It was now decided that as they had a huge
"amount of plunder they had better give up piracy, so they sailed away to"
the West Indies and surrendered themselves to the Governor of Porto Bello.
"The crew broke up and each man, with a bag of diamonds, went whither he"
"would; but Captain Taylor joined the Spanish service, and was put in"
"command of a man-of-war, which was sent to attack the English logwood"
cutters in the Bay of Honduras.
"TAYLOR, WILLIAM."
One of Captain Phillips's crew. Wounded in the leg while attempting to
"desert. There being no surgeon on board, a consultation was held over the"
"patient by the whole crew, and these learned men were unanimous in"
agreeing that the leg should be amputated. Some dispute then arose as to
"who should act the part of surgeon, and at length the carpenter was chosen"
"as the most proper person. ""Upon which he fetch'd up the biggest saw, and"
"taking the limb under his Arm, fell to Work, and separated it from the"

David is really the center of this territory. It is a typical Central
"American town of about 15,000 people, with a plaza, a cathedral, a hotel"
and all the appurtenances of metropolitan life in Panama. The place is
"attractive in its way, with its streets of white-walled, red-tiled"
"dwellings, with blue or green doors and shutters. It seems to have grown"
"with some steadiness, for though the Panama census for 1912 gave it"
"15,000 inhabitants, travelers like Mr. Forbes Lindsay and Albert"
"Edwards, who visited it only a year or two earlier, gave it only from"
"5000 to 8000 people. Its growth, however, is natural and healthy, for"
the country round it is developing rapidly. You reach David now by boats
of the Pacific Mail and the National Navigation Company from Panama. The
"quickest trip takes thirty hours. When the government railroad is built,"
"about which there is some slight doubt, the whole country will be opened"
and should be quickly settled. The road in all probability will be
continued to Bocas del Toro on the Atlantic coast.

"While the cattle business of the Chiriqui region is its chief mainstay,"
it is far from being developed to its natural extent. The Commissary

failed. Practically all of the meat thus used is furnished by the
so-called “Beef Trust” of the United States. It is believed that there

CHAPTER IX
HALF-LIGHT
"Once before she had placed herself in his path, trusting to her skill,"
"her daring, above all, her beauty. With laughter in her heart and"
cold-blooded coquetry she had chosen out the spot before the altar
where the sunlight struck burnished gold from her waving hair and lent
"deeper, softening shades to her eyes. With cruel satisfaction, not"
"unmixed with admiration, she had seen her power successful and the"
awe-struck wonder and veneration creep into his face. In the silence
and peace of the temple she had plunged reckless hands into the woven
"threads of his life. Amidst the shriek of war, face to face with"
"death, she sought to save him. It was another woman who stood opposite"
"the yielding, cracking door, past whose head a half-spent bullet spat"
"its way, burying itself in the wall behind her,--another woman,"
"disheveled, forgetful of her wan beauty, trusting to no power but that"
which her heart gave her to face the man she had betrayed and ruined.
Yet both in an instantaneous flash remembered that first meeting. The
"drawn sword sank, point downward. He stood motionless in the shattered"
"doorway, holding out a hand which commanded, and obtained, a"
"petrified, waiting silence from the armed horde whose faces glared"
hatred and the lust of slaughter in the narrow space behind. Whatever
"had been his resolution, whatever the detestation and contempt which"
"had filled him, all sank now into an ocean of reborn pain."
"""Why are you here?"" he asked sternly. ""Why have you not fled?"""
"the wholesale slaughter, not only of those in the palace, but also of"
the inhabitants of the town of San Ildefonso.
"Then in her turn La Giralda told of her visit to the pavilion, of the"
"little Queen, passionate, joyous, kindly natured, absolutely Spanish,"
till the hearts of her hearers melted to the tale.
"""Our orders are to capture her and her mother the Regent,"" said Rollo,"
"thoughtfully. ""It would therefore serve our purpose but ill if we"
permitted these two to be sacrificed to the bloodthirsty fury of a mob
"of plunderers!"""
"""Then the sooner we find ourselves within the gates, the more chance we"
"shall have of saving them both!"" said the Sergeant. ""Serve out the"
"_puchero_, La Giralda!"""
Concha had taken no part in the discussion. But she had listened with
"all her ears, and now in the pause that followed she declared her"
unalterable intention of making one of the party.
"""I also am of Andalucia,"" she said with calm determination, ""there are"
two others of my country here who will answer for me. You cannot leave
"me alone, and La Giralda will be needed as guide when once you reach the"
"palace precincts. I shall not be in the way, I promise you, and if it"
"comes to gun and pistol, there I think you will not find me wanting!"""
"In his heart and though he made several objections, Rollo was glad"
enough to give way. For with all the unknown dangers of the night before
"them, and the certainty of bloodshed when the gipsies should attack, he"
relished still less the thought of leaving Concha alone in that pit on
the chill side of Guadarrama.
"Instantly a voice answered, ""I am Idu of the Chagai Levies, friendly"
"to the British Government."""
"I then called out who I was, and, immediately, three fully armed men"
came forward in the darkness.
"I asked them what they were doing there, and the voice that had"
answered me before replied that they were all three members of the
"Chagai Levies, and that they, and about fifty others, had come out to"
fight me.
"""To fight me?"" I exclaimed. ""Whatever for?"""
"""Well, Sahib,"" returned the man who had said his name was Idu, ""we"
"thought you were a German airship."" And he went on to explain that"
for a long time he and his companions had been watching powerful
"lights floating about in the sky, and as they knew that Germans were"
"the only people in the world who had _hawaiijihaz_ or airships, they"
were convinced the lights they had seen belonged to one of these. And
"when it had alighted on the hill in front of them, the majority of"
"his companions had been so terrified that they had run away, and only"
himself and his two comrades had had the bravery to stay where they
were and face the unknown danger.
Then it dawned on me what he was driving at. The flashing electric
"lights of the car, lighting up the distant, rising slopes of the"
"desert, had appeared to these men to come from the sky, and my"
"harmless motor-car the dreaded German airship. Cars, of course, along"
"this route were as great a novelty as airships, and doubtless not one"
of the men in front of me had ever seen one before.
"I reassured them as completely as I could, adding that I was"

"bowels or liver, or in congestion of any part, small repeated doses are"

disorders.
AETHER--ETHER--PURE ETHER
"A liquid composed of about 96 per cent, by weight, of absolute ether or"
"ethyl oxide, and about 4 per cent of alcohol containing a little water."
DERIVATION.--Prepared by distillation of alcohol with sulphuric acid.
There are two steps in the production of ether; sulphorvinic acid and
water are formed in the first step. Sulphorvinic acid is then further
acted upon by alcohol. The distillate is freed from water by agitation
with calcium oxide and chloride and subjected to redistillation.
"PROPERTIES.--A transparent, colorless, mobile liquid, having a"
characteristic odor and a burning and sweetish taste. Ether is highly
"volatile and inflammable; its vapor, when mixed with air and ignited,"
"explodes violently. Miscible in all proportions with alcohol,"
"chloroform, benzine, benzol, fixed and volatile oils. Ether is a solvent"
"for fats, oils, alkaloids, resins, gutta percha and guncotton. Upon"
evaporation ether should have no residue. Ether vapor is heavier than
air and consequently etherization should never be done above a light or
fire.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 ozs.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 4 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 ms. to 1 dr."

"difficulty, in that they could not remain indefinitely in England after"
taking their degrees and being away from the place of recruitment their
claims were overlooked.
"83,643. There was no reason why a European should be paid a higher rate"
of salary than an Indian on account of the distance he came. An Indian
felt a sense of inferiority if a difference was made as regards pay. The
very slight saving which government made by differentiating between the
two did not compensate for the feeling of wrong done. This feeling would
"remain even if the pay was the same, but an additional grant in the"
shape of a foreign service allowance was made to Europeans. All workers
"in the field of education should feel a sense of solidarity, because"
"they were all serving one great cause, namely, education."
"83,644. The term ""professor"", as at present used in India, was"
"undoubtedly a comprehensive one, but it was equally comprehensive in the"

respectively. He would for various reasons prefer a large number of

pay of the Indian and the pay of the European.
"83,647. (Sir Valentine Chirol). The witness attached great value to the"
influence of the teacher upon the student in the earlier stages of his
"education, and it was in these stages that that influence could best be"
exercised. At the same time he desired to limit the appointment of
non-Indians to men of very great distinction.

DR. J. C. BOSE CALLED AND EXAMINED
"83,635. (Chairman). The witness favoured an arrangement by which Indians"
"would enter the higher ranks of the service, either through the"
Provincial Service or by direct recruitment in India. The latter class
"of officers, after completing their education in India, should"
ordinarily go to Europe with a view to widening their experience. By
this he did not wish to decry the training given in the Indian
"Universities, which produced some of the very best men, and he would not"
make the rule absolute. It was not necessary for men of exceptional
"ability to go to England in order to occupy a high chair. Unfortunately,"
on account of there being no openings for men of genius in the
"Educational Service, distinguished men were driven to the profession of"
Law. In the present condition of India a larger number of distinguished
men were needed to give their lives to the education of the people.
"83,636. The witness himself had spent part of his career in Europe, and"
"looking back he could say that this had been of great profit to him,"
"not so much on account of the training he got, as by being brought into"
personal contact with eminent men whose influence extorted his
"admiration, and create in him a feeling of emulation. In this way he"
"owed a great deal to Lord Rayleigh under whom he worked, but he did not"
see why that advantage should not eventually be secured by Indians in
India under an Indian Lord Rayleigh.
"83,637. There should be only one Educational Service, but men who were"
distinguished in any subject should not start from its very lowest rung
but should be placed somewhere in the middle of it.
"83,638. There were men in the Provincial Service who were very"
"on the field an hour, whence he was removed to hospital."
"Probably the track pierced the ilium, and remained confined to"
the abdominal wall. There were no signs of visceral injury.
"(159) Cape Boy. Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_ (Lee-Metford),"
immediately above and outside right anterior superior spine;
"_exit_, 1-1/2 inch below and to right of umbilicus. A"
well-marked swelling corresponded with division of the fibres
"of the oblique muscles and of the rectus, and on palpation a"
hollow corresponding with the track was felt. The abdominal
muscles were exceptionally well developed (fig. 84).
"(160) Wounded at Magersfontein while lying prone. _Entry_,"
"irregular, oblique, and somewhat contused, over the eighth left"
"rib, in the anterior axillary line; _exit_, a slit wound"
immediately above and to the left of the umbilicus. The bullet
"struck a small circular metal looking-glass before entering,"
hence the irregularity of the wound. The patient developed a
"hæmothorax, but no abdominal signs; the former was probably"
"parietal in origin, secondary to the fractured rib, and the"
whole wound non-penetrating as far as the abdominal cavity was
concerned.
"(161) Wounded at Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), 1-1/2 inch"
external to and 1/2 inch below the left posterior superior
"iliac spine; _exit_, 1 inch internal horizontally to the left"
anterior superior spine.
"No signs of intra-peritoneal injury were noted, but free"
suppuration occurred in left loin; the ilium was tunnelled.
The same patient was wounded by a Jeffrey bullet in the hand;
"RACKAM, CAPTAIN JOHN, _alias_ CALICO JACK."
Served as quartermaster in Captain Vane's company. On one occasion Vane
"refused to fight a big French ship, and in consequence was dismissed his"
"ship and marooned on an uninhabited island off the coast of America, while"
the crew elected Rackam to be their captain in his place. This was on
"November 24th, 1718, and on the very first day of his command he had the"
good fortune to take and plunder several small vessels.
"Off the Island of Jamaica they took a Madeira ship, and found an old"
"friend on board as a passenger--a Mr. Hosea Tisdell, who kept a tavern in"
"the island, and they treated him with great respect."
"Christmas Day coming, the pirates landed on a small island to celebrate"
"this festival in a thorough manner, carousing and drinking as long as the"
"liquor lasted, when they sailed away to seek more. Their next prize was a"
"strange one. On coming alongside a ship, she surrendered, and the pirates"
"boarding her to examine her cargo, found it to consist of thieves from"
"Newgate on their way to the plantations. Taking two more vessels, Rackam"
"sailed to the Bahama Islands, but the Governor, Captain Woodes Rogers,"
"sent a sloop, which took away their prizes."
"Rackam now sailed his ship to a snug little cove he knew of in Cuba, where"
he had more than one lady acquaintance. Here the pirates were very happy
until all their provisions and money was spent. Just as they were about to
"sail, in comes a Spanish Guarda del Costa with a small English sloop which"
"they had recently taken. Rackam was now in a very awkward position, being"
"unable to get past the Spaniard, and all he could do was to hide behind a"
"small island. Night came on, and when it was dark Rackam put all his crew"
"into a boat, rowed quietly up to the sloop, clambered aboard, threatening"
Doome took an early opportunity to draw me aside and to whisper to me
the grave disappointment it must be to all who respected him if they
"should discover the real Don Juan, begged me not to expose him, and"
pointed out the serious loss of prestige he must suffer in the eyes of
the British Public; so we sat down together on a sofa and pitied him
for his decencies.
"Luddy, luddy! how the homely virtues will persist!"
"The idol of our youth, the dark, mysteriously wicked man--with feet of"
"honest clay and a clean simple heart after all! Even prolific, and----"
"Well, damn romance, say I...."
"Oh, and more!"
Even the gods fall out--drift apart.
Aubrey and the O’Myre go different ways--Aubrey in pain that O’Myre
has now discovered that there is no great work of art without a moral
"purpose--Aubrey holding that Aubrey himself is sufficient purpose. He,"
"Aubrey, avers that he has found himself--nothing matters after that."
He must back to Paris. There the women have secular lips and voices
of brocade and understand being loved. Tiens! He will in future give
his splendid talents to attack the Philistinic brutality of strength
and the barbarity of the over-rated glory in mere outdoor delight
that to-day holds England in poisonous embrace; in all the pride of
"effeminacy he withdraws into the palace of his Egoism, where he is"
"lord--back to Paris--_there_ are mirrors, where he may reflect upon"
"himself, take himself up by the roots and dwell upon his own image!"
"followed Tilly were, beside these, gentle and kindly men."
'God help us!' my lady cried fervently. 'God help this great city! God
help the North! Never was such a battle fought as must be fought
here!'
"We went down very much sobered, filled with awe and wonder and"
"great thoughts, the dullest of us feeling the air heavy with portents,"
the more clerkly considering of Armageddon and the Last Fight.
Briefly--for thirteen years the Emperor and the Papists had hustled
"and harried the Protestants; had dragooned Donauwörth, and held down"
"Bohemia, and plundered the Palatinate, and crushed the King of"
"Denmark, and wherever there was a weak Protestant state had pressed"
sorely on it. Then one short year before I stood on the Burg above the
"Pegnitz, the Protestant king had come out of the North like a"
"thunderbolt, had shattered in a month the Papist armies, had run like"
"a devouring fire down the Priests' Lane, rushed over Bohemia, shaken"
the Emperor on his throne!
But could he maintain himself? That was now to be seen. To the
"Emperor's help had come all who loved the old system, and would have"
it that the south was Germany; all who wished to chain men's minds and
saw their profit in the shadow of the imperial throne; all who lived
"by license and plunder, and reckoned a mass to-day against a murder"
"to-morrow. All these had come, from the great Duke of Friedland"
"grasping at empire, to the meanest freebooter with peasant's blood on"
"his hands and in his veins; and there they lay opposite us,"
"impregnably placed on the Burgstall, waiting patiently until famine"
"and the sword should weaken the fair city, and enable them to plunge"
their vulture's talons into its vitals.
No wonder that in Nuremberg the citizens could be distinguished from
"Chiriqui with a view to establishing a packing house there, but"
reported that the supply of cattle was inadequate for even the smallest
establishment. Yet the country is admirably adapted for cattle raising.
[Illustration: PRIMITIVE SUGAR MILL]
"The climate of this region is equable, both as to temperature and"
humidity. Epidemic diseases are practically unknown among either men or
beasts. Should irrigation in future seem needful to agriculture the
multitude of streams furnish an ample water supply and innumerable sites
for reservoirs.
Westward from David the face of the country rises gently until you come
"to the Caldera Valley which lies at the foot of the Chiriqui Peak, an"
extinct volcano perhaps 8000 feet high. Nowhere in Panama do the
"mountains rise very high, though the range is clearly a connection of"
the Cordilleras of North and South America. The Chiriqui Peak has not in
"the memory of man been in eruption, but the traces of its volcanic"
character are unmistakable. Its crater is a circular plain about half a
mile in diameter surrounded by a densely wooded precipitous ridge. As
the ascent is continued the woods give way to grass and rocks. While
"there is a distinct timber line, no snow line is attained. At the foot"
"of the mountain is El Bouquette, much esteemed by the Panamanians as a"
"health resort. Thither go Canal workers who, not being permitted to"
"remain on the Zone during their vacations, wish to avoid the long voyage"
to North American ports.
[Illustration: CHIRIQUI NATIVES IN AN OX-CART]
This neighborhood is the center of the coffee-growing industry which
should be profitable in Panama if a heavy protective tariff could make
it so. But not even enough of the fragrant berries are grown to supply
one hand and a dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from
"it in the other."" They took nine Portuguese vessels off the coast of"
"Brazil, out of which they took plunder of very great value."
"Quelch now had the audacity to sail back to Marblehead, where his crew"
landed and quickly scattered with their plunder. Within a week Quelch was
"in gaol, and was taken to Boston, where his trial began on June 17th,"
"1704, and he was found guilty. The days between the sentence and the"
"execution must have, indeed, been trying for the prisoner. We read in a"
"pamphlet published at the time: ""The Ministers of the Town used more than"
ordinary Endeavours to Instruct the Prisoners and bring them to
"Repentance. There were Sermons Preached in their hearing Every Day, and"
"Prayer daily made with them. And they were Catechised, and they had many"
occasional Exhortations. And nothing was left that could be done for their
"Good."""
"On Friday, June 30th, 1704, Quelch and his companions marched on foot"
through the town of Boston to Scarlil's Wharf with a strong armed guard of
"musketeers, accompanied by various officials and two ministers, while in"
"front was carried a silver oar, the emblem of a pirate's execution. Before"
the last act the minister gave a long and fervent harangue to the wretched
"culprits, in all of whom were observed suitable signs of repentance except"
"Quelch, who, stepping forward on the platform, his hat in his hand, and"
"bowing left and right to the spectators, gave a short address, in which he"
"warned them ""They should take care how they brought Money into New England"
"to be Hanged for it."""
"QUITTANCE, JOHN."
One of Captain Quelch's crew of the brigantine _Charles_. Tried with the
"rest of that crew at the Star Tavern at Boston in June, 1704."
"tapering towards the end are made. The real Kula article, in which"
"the discs are much thinner, smaller in diameter and even in size from"
"one end of the necklace to the other, these were introduced into the"
"Kula at other points, and I shall speak about this subject in one"
"of the following chapters (Chapter XXI), where the other branches of"
the Kula are described.
IV
"Now, having come to an end of this digression on kaloma, let us return"
"for another short while to our Sinaketan party, whom we have left"
on the Lagoon of Sanaroa. Having obtained a sufficient amount of the
"shells, they set sail, and re-visiting Tewara and Gumasila, stopping"
"perhaps for a night on one of the sandbanks of Pilolu, they arrive at"
last in their home Lagoon. But before rejoining their people in their
"villages, they stop for the last halt on Muwa. Here they make what is"
"called tanarere, a comparison and display of the valuables obtained"
"on this trip. From each canoe, a mat or two are spread on the sand"
"beach, and the men put their necklaces on the mat. Thus a long row of"
"valuables lies on the beach, and the members of the expedition walk"
"up and down, admire, and count them. The chiefs would, of course,"
"have always the greatest haul, more especially the one who has been"
the toli'uvalaku on that expedition.
"After this is over, they return to the village. Each canoe blows its"
"conch shell, a blast for each valuable that it contains. When a canoe"
"has obtained no vaygu'a at all, this means great shame and distress"
"for its members, and especially for the toliwaga. Such a canoe is"
"said to bisikureya, which means literally 'to keep a fast.'"
Having resumed their respective stations the cruiser and the
destroyer flotilla followed. Owing to the greatly reduced speed of
the hostile aircraft it was an easy matter to maintain a fixed
"relative distance between them and the British vessels, whose"
attention was divided between the prospect of an aerial meeting with
seaplanes and the risk of being intercepted by the torpedo of a
"German submarine, to say nothing of floating mines."
"""She's cast off!"" shouted a dozen voices."
"Such was the case. The two Zeppelins had parted company, one flying"
"off at a terrific speed, rising rapidly as she did so, while the"
"other, being without means of propulsion, drifted at the mercy of the"
winds.
It was now dawn. The grey light of morning was already overcoming the
strength of the searchlights and it was already possible to discern
the outlines of the abandoned Zeppelin by the natural light of day.
Pelting up from the eastward came the air squadron of seaplanes. Half
"a dozen circled and started off in pursuit of the fugitive airship,"
"which, travelling at high speed, was now but a faint speck against"
the ruddy sky.
"The rest advanced boldly upon the disabled Zeppelin, although"
"ignorant of the fact that she had jettisoned her guns, and, save for"
"a few rifles, was without means of defence."
"The seaplanes' automatic guns spat viciously, and as the range"
decreased almost every shot began to tell. The huge fabric once more
"began to drop, as the small projectile ripped through the flimsy"
aluminium envelope.
"Isthmus, and even a request from the chief that the war vessel that"
brought the negotiator on his fruitless errand should leave was acceded
"to. It is quite unlikely, however, that the Indians will be able to"
maintain their isolation much longer. Already there are signs of its
breaking down. While I was in Panama they sent a request that a
"missionary, a woman it is true, who had been much among them, should"
come and live with them permanently. They also expressed a desire that
"she should bring her melodeon, thus giving new illustration to the"
"poetic adage, “Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast”. Perhaps"
the phonograph may in time prove the open sesame to many savage bosoms.
Among this people it is the women who cling most tenaciously to the
"primitive customs, as might be expected, since they have been so"
assiduously guarded against the wiles of the world. But Catholic
"missionaries have made some headway in the country, and at Narganá"
schools for girls have been opened under auspices of the church. It is
probably due to the feminine influence that the San Blas men return so
unfailingly to primitive customs after the voyages that have made them
familiar with civilization. If the women yield to the desire for novelty
the splendid isolation of the San Blas will not long endure. Perhaps
"that would be unfortunate, for all other primitive peoples who have"
surrendered to the wiles of the white men have suffered and disappeared.

"""I want to see Mr. Jobling, at once,"" Slyne announced to him. And Mr."
"Jobling's ""managing clerk"" looked slowly round, with a snake-like and"
disconcerting effect due to a very long neck and a very low collar.
"""Show Mr. Slyne in immediately, Mullins,"" ordered a pompous voice from"
"within; and Mr. Jobling himself, a blackcoated, portly, important"
"personage there, came bustling out from his private office to welcome"
his visitors.
"""How d'ye do, how d'ye do, Lady Josceline!"" he exclaimed, and cocked an"
arch eyebrow at Sallie's most becoming costume; although the effect he
intended was somewhat impaired by the fact that he was still suffering
"from a black eye, painted over in haste--and by an incompetent artist."
"""I can see now what's been keeping _you_ in Paris!"" he added"
"facetiously, and, having shaken hands with Slyne, who seemed to think"
"that superfluous, turned to receive Captain Dove with the same"
politeness.
"""Phew!"" whistled Mr. Jobling and drew back and stared at the old man."
"""I'd _never_ have recognised you in that rig-out."""
"Captain Dove pulled off a pair of smoked glasses he had been wearing,"
"the better to look him, with offensive intent, in his injured eye. For"
Captain Dove was still enduring much mental as well as physical
discomfort in a disguise which he had only been induced to adopt a
"couple of days before, and after an embittered quarrel with Slyne. The"
stiff white collar round his corded neck was still threatening to choke
him and then cut his throat. He had been infinitely more at his ease in
"his scanty, short-tailed frock-coat and furry top-hat than he was in the"
"somewhat baggy if more becoming black garb he had donned in its place,"
with a soft wide-awake always flapping about his ears.
one another during subsequent peace and quiet.
"Above all, he did not want Alice to emerge from this moment of personal"
danger morally bound to some unsuitable mate because of a child
conceived under the shadow of the sword!
"Hourly, after the coded signals came in, Ted Wilson took the microphone"
himself and called out into space in the infrawave. He called messages
"of hope, and explained how many spacecraft were scouring the deep black"
"void. He could only pray that he would be heard, that his voice would"
give Alice some firm foundation for hope.
He could not be sure the passengers from the wrecked spaceship even had
"their receivers turned on, because infrawave receivers drink up a lot"
of power and lifeships are not equipped with any vast reserve. There
just was not the room in a lifeship for anything more than the bare
necessities of living.
"The search grid was a truncated cone, and the whitened areas of"
finished search had finally filled the smaller end of the cone. There
"was the flared skirt of the cone yet to be combed, and this provided"
more volume than the cylinder taken out of the middle. It also provided
"a shorter search path as the searching spacecraft built out the volume,"
ring after ring around the first pass along the line of flight.
"Far, far to one side a detector registered, and brought every man"
in the fleet to the alert. Then they relaxed unhappily again as the
scooter returned with another report of a small gas cloud. Wilson
"thought glumly that they had discovered enough space meteors, gas"
"clouds, and unawakened comets to make up a small sun."
Then his attention was taken from his own personal troubles by the
entertained it.  It was decided that the rubbish left after some
repairs had been done to the barracks should be used for mending and
"filling up the ditches in their street, and for the transport of this"
"five horses were given by the fire brigade.  Still more, they even saw"
the necessity of laying a drain-pipe through the street.  This and many
other things vastly increased the popularity of the teacher.  He wrote
petitions for them and published various remarks in the newspapers.
"For instance, on one occasion Vaviloff's customers noticed that the"
herrings and other provisions of the eating-house were not what they
"should be, and after a day or two they saw Vaviloff standing at the bar"
with the newspaper in his hand making a public apology.
"""It is true, I must acknowledge, that I bought old and not very good"
"herrings, and the cabbage ... also ... was old.  It is only too well"
known that anyone can put many a five-kopeck piece in his pocket in
this way.  And what is the result?  It has not been a success; I was
"greedy, I own, but the cleverer man has exposed me, so we are quits ..."""
"This confession made a very good impression on the people, and it also"
gave Vaviloff the opportunity of still feeding them with herrings and
"cabbages which were not good, though they failed to notice it, so much"
were they impressed.
"This incident was very significant, because it increased not only the"
"teacher's popularity, but also the effect of press opinion."
"It often happened, too, that the teacher read lectures on practical"
morality in the eating-house.
"""I saw you,"" he said to the painter Yashka Tyarin, ""I saw you, Yakov,"
"beating your wife ..."""
"""There are some of them upstairs now,"" she replied, ""but, alas, none who"
will ever reclaim them from us! The excuse is the best that can be
"devised to introduce us into San Ildefonso, and, perhaps, if we have"
"luck, inside the palisades of La Granja also."""
"So without further parley the Sergeant proceeded, in the most"
"matter-of-fact way possible, to load the ass with huge fagots of"
kindling wood till the animal showed only four feet paddling along under
"its burden, and a pair of patient orbs, black and beady like those of"
"the Sergeant himself, peering out of a hay-coloured matting of hair."
"This done, the Sergeant turned his sharp eyes every way about the dim"
"smoky horizon. He could note, as easily as on a map, the precise notch"
in the many purple-tinted gorges where they had left their party. It was
exactly like all the others which slit and dimple the slopes of the
"Guadarrama, but in this matter it was as impossible for the Sergeant to"
make a mistake as for a town-dweller to err as to the street in which he
has lived for years.
"But no one was watching them. No clump of juniper held a spy, and the"
Sergeant was at liberty to develop his plans. He turned quickly upon the
old gipsy woman.
"""La Giralda,"" he said, ""there is small use in discovering the"
"disposition of the courtiers in San Ildefonso--ay, or even the defences"
"of the palace, if we know nothing of the Romany who are to march"
"to-night upon the place."""
"La Giralda, who had been drawing a little milk from the udders of each"
"she-goat, to ease them for their travel, suddenly sprang erect."
"all the debate was important, and the hour of the division drew near;"
"and when the question was put and the bell rang, nearly half the House"
"trooped out with virtuous air to join the other half, persistently"
"gossiping in the lobby, and, with them, decide the fateful question."
One more strange thing was to happen at that sitting.
"It was not strange that the Government were beaten by three votes, that"
"only one of those wavering men voted with his old party at last, but it"
"was strange that when this result was announced, and Medland's followers"
settled sturdily in their seats to endure the celebration of the
"triumph, the celebration did not come. There was hardly a cheer, and"
"Medland himself, whom the result seemed hardly to have roused, woke with"
a start to the unwonted silence. It struck to his heart: it seemed like
a tribute of respect to a dead enemy. But he rose and briefly said that
on the next day an announcement of the Government's intentions would be
made by himself--he paused here a moment--or one of his colleagues. He
"sat down again. The sitting was at an end, and the House adjourned."
"Members began to go out, but, as the Premier rose, they drew back and"
"left a path for him down the middle of the House. As he went, one or two"
"thrust out their hands to him, and one honest fellow shouted in his"
"rough voice--he was a labouring-man member--""You're not done yet,"
"Jimmy!"""
"The shout touched him, he lifted his head, looked round with a smile,"
"and, just raising again the hat he had put on as he neared the door,"
took Norburn's arm and passed out of the House.
"When Sir Robert followed, he found the Chief Justice waiting for him,"
"and they walked off together. For a long while neither spoke, but at"
"last Sir Robert said peevishly,"
"tenth 103°. The man was very ill, and an exploring needle was"
"inserted, by which about an ounce of blood was evacuated. The"
signs of fluid in the left pleura were accompanied by those of
"consolidation over the lower fourth of the right lung, and the"
sputa were rusty. Evidence of perforation of the left axillary
artery existed in feebleness of the radial pulse; and there was
musculo-spiral paralysis.
"After the preliminary puncture, the man refused any further"
"operative treatment, although a second rise of temperature"
"commenced on the fifteenth day, culminating in a temperature of"
103.2° on the eighteenth. The further treatment of the patient
consisted in the ensurance of rest and the alleviation of pain.
A steady fall in the temperature extended over another three
"weeks, together with diminution in the signs of fluid in the"
"pleura. At the end of seventy-four days the man was sent home,"
"some slight dulness at the left base, and contraction of the"
chest sufficient to influence the spine in the way of lateral
"curvature, being the only remaining signs."

(155) _Severe hæmothorax. Secondary effusion. Spontaneous
"recovery._--Wounded at Koodoosberg Drift, at a distance of 200"
"yards. _Entry_, at angle of the right scapula; _exit_, at the"
junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the

brought in from the field twelve miles by an ambulance wagon on
"the second day, and in crossing the Modder River he was"
accidentally upset into the stream. For the first four days
"Provincial Service, and they obtained fairly good men. It would not be"
right for a great Government to grant a minimum pay to Indian Professors
"and an extravagantly high pay to their European colleagues, for doing"
the same kind of work.
"83,669. At the Presidency College the facilities for scientific work"
were now greater than in many institutions in England. India was now
"becoming a great country for Biological research. Again, the Physical"
and Chemical Laboratories at the Presidency College were finer than many
in England. If young men of science in England thought they obtained
better opportunities in pursuing their subjects in New Zealand and
"Toronto than in India, the India office ought to remove that impression"
at once.
"83,670. (Lord Ronaldshay). When an Indian graduate under the witnesses'"
scheme was appointed direct to the higher service in India he would not
compel him to go to England for a period of training. The person who
would be appointed in India directly from the Indian Universities would
have to have previously served with distinction in subordinate
positions; a visit to Europe would be an advantage but not absolutely
necessary.
"83,671. (Mr. Biss). The cost of living in Calcutta to an Indian"
Professor or Lecturer would all depend as the style in which he lived.
In each service there is always a standard of living to which every
member is expected to conform. An Indian Professor had to go to Europe
from time to time to keep himself in touch with the developments of his
subject. An Indian officer had to support a large number of relations.
The question of a man's private expenses should not be raised in fixing
his pay. One might as well inquire whether the candidate for admission
"to the service was a bachelor or married, or as to how many children he"
"had. He had known Europeans who had led a simple life, and had been all"
"the author's attitude, and thus lessen the value of his work. It is"
"most desirable, in order to prevent this, that the author carefully"
inspect the index while in manuscript. He can thus detect possible
departures in the indexer's condensed expression of his own thought.
The following rules and suggestions are given with a twofold object
"in mind: _first_, to prevent those authors who possess the necessary"
qualifications from avoiding the preparation of their own indexes
"because of unfamiliarity with the technical details; _second_, to"
enable authors intelligently to criticize the form as well as the
matter of those indexes which are prepared for their volumes by other
hands.
WHAT TO INDEX
The closeness with which a book is to be indexed depends partly upon
the nature of its contents and partly upon the ideas of the author
or publisher. Some indexes contain only the page references; some
are so analytical that a reader can gain an excellent idea of the
"subject-matter itself. These, however, represent the two extremes. The"
ordinary index aims to give every reference necessary to enable the
"reader to locate easily the subject-matter for which he searches, but"
"not a synopsis of that subject-matter. The entries should cover, then,"
"with more or less minuteness, as desired, the following:"
"(_a_) Proper names, whether of persons, places, religious or political"
"bodies, etc."
(_b_) Events and periods.
(_c_) Titles of books to which reference is made.
(_d_) Specific topics or subjects.
(_e_) Definitions.
"written against Luther. He will read him, he will soon take up something"
"to quiet the tumult. He succeeds in getting Aleander, who arrived at"
"Louvain in June, to prohibit preaching against him. The Pope still hopes"
"that Aleander will succeed in bringing back Erasmus, with whom he is"
"again on friendly terms, to the right track."
But Erasmus began to consider the only exit which was now left to him:
to leave Louvain and the Netherlands to regain his menaced independence.
The occasion to depart had long ago presented itself: the third edition
of his New Testament called him to Basle once more. It would not be a
"permanent departure, and he purposed to return to Louvain. On 28 October"
(his birthday) he left the town where he had spent four difficult years.
His chambers in the College of the Lily were reserved for him and he
left his books behind. On 15 November he reached Basle.
Soon the rumour spread that out of fear of Aleander he had saved himself
"by flight. But the idea, revived again in our days in spite of Erasmus's"
"own painstaking denial, that Aleander should have cunningly and"
"expressly driven him from the Netherlands, is inherently improbable. So"
"far as the Church was concerned, Erasmus would at almost any point be"
"more dangerous than at Louvain, in the headquarters of conservatism,"
"under immediate control of the strict Burgundian government, where, it"
"seemed, he could sooner or later be pressed into the service of the"
anti-Lutheran policy.
"It was this contingency, as Dr. Allen has correctly pointed out, which"
he feared and evaded. Not for his bodily safety did he emigrate; Erasmus
would not have been touched--he was far too valuable an asset for such
"measures. It was his mental independence, so dear to him above all else,"
"that he felt to be threatened; and, to safeguard that, he did not return"
to Louvain.
hour even to approach the receiving counter--Vivie walked across to
the _Palace Hotel_ and asked the night porter to get her a room. But
"every room was occupied, they said--Americans, British, wealthy war"
"refugees from southern Belgium, military officers of the Allies. The"
only concession made to her--for the porter could hold out little
hope of any neighbouring hotel having an empty room--was to allow
her to sit and sleep in one of the comfortable basket chairs in the
long atrium. At six o'clock a compassionate waiter who knew the name
of Mrs. Warren gave her daughter some coffee and milk and a
_brioche_. At seven she managed to get her luggage taken to one of
the trams at the corner of the Boulevard du Jardin Botanique. The
train service to Tervueren was suspended--and at the Porte de Namur
she would be transferred to the No. 45 tram which would take her out
to Tervueren.
Even at an early hour Brussels seemed crowded and as the tram passed
along the handsome boulevards the shops were being opened and
tourists were on their way to Waterloo in brakes. Every one seemed
"to think in mid-August, 1914, that Germany was destined to receive"
her _coup-de-grâce_ on the field of Waterloo. It would be so
appropriate. And no one--at any rate of those who spoke their
thoughts aloud--seemed to consider that Brussels was menaced.
"Leaving her luggage at the tram terminus, Vivie sped on foot through"
"forest roads, where the dew still glistened, to the Villa"
"Beau-séjour. Mrs. Warren was not yet dressed, but was rapturous in"
"her greeting. Her chauffeur had been called up, so the auto could"
"not go out, but a farm cart would be sent for the luggage."
"""I believe, mother, I'm going to enjoy myself enormously,"" said"
"Vivie as she sat in the verandah in the morning sunshine, making a"
"delicious _petit déjeuner_ out of fresh rolls, the butter of the"
"passed in front and back of the body over a string tied around the hips,"
the forward extremity being left longer and flowing like an apron. On
feast days the string is replaced by a broad band of white beads. Around
the neck and chest they wear thick cords of the same beads and on their
wrists broad silver cuffs. Hats are not used; the hair is usually tied
with a red ribbon and often adorned with the bright flowers of the
forest.
"“The female outfit is not less simple, consisting of a piece of calico"
"less than three feet wide and about nine feet long, wrapped around the"
lower part of the body and reaching a little below the knees. This is
"all, except that the neck is more or less loaded with beads or silver"
"coins. But for this the women display less coquetry than the men, which"
may be because they feel sufficiently adorned with their mere natural
"charms. Fondness for cheap rings is, however, common to both sexes, and"
little children often wear earrings or pendants.

“The scantiness of the clothing is remedied very effectually by face and
"body painting, in which black and red colors are used, the first"
exclusively for daily wear. At times men and women are painted black
from the waist down; at other times it is the whole body or only the
"hands and feet, etc., all according to the day’s fashion, as was"
explained by one of our guides. For feast days the paintings are an
"elaborate and artistic affair, consisting of elegantly drawn lines and"
patterns--red and black or simply black--which clothe the body as
effectually as any costly dress.
The gypsum and salt deposits of the Salina show that toward the
close of the Silurian period a slight oscillation brought the sea
"floor nearer to the surface, and at the north cut off extensive"
"tracts from the interior sea. In these wide lagoons, which now and"
then regained access to the open sea and obtained new supplies of
"salt water, beds of salt and gypsum were deposited as the briny"
waters became concentrated by evaporation under a desert climate.
Along with these beds there were also laid shales and impure
limestones.
"In New York the ""salt pans"" of the Salina extended over an area"
one hundred and fifty miles long from east to west and sixty miles
"wide, and similar salt marshes occurred as far west as Cleveland,"
"Ohio, and Goderich on Lake Huron. At Ithaca, New York, the series"
"is fifteen hundred feet thick, and is buried beneath an equal"
thickness of later strata. It includes two hundred and fifty feet
"of solid salt, in several distinct beds, each sealed within the"
shales of the series.
Would you expect to find ancient beds of rock salt inclosed in
beds of pervious sandstone?
The salt beds of the Salina are of great value. They are reached
"by well borings, and their brines are evaporated by solar heat and"
by boiling. The rock salt is also mined from deep shafts.
"Similar deposits of salt, formed under like conditions, occur in"
the rocks of later systems down to the present. The salt beds of
"Texas are Permian, those of Kansas are Permian, and those of"
Louisiana are Tertiary.
No foot is allowed to touch the _Scala Santa_; it must be ascended
on the knees. A number of people were going up in this way when
"we entered, pausing on each step to repeat a prayer, for which"
indulgences are granted by the Pope. There are stairways on each
"side, by which those who have thus crawled up may walk down. The"
"only man I know of that ever walked down the Holy Stairs themselves,"
"and the most illustrious man that ever crawled up them on his knees,"
"was Martin Luther. When he had mounted slowly half way up, step by"
"step on his knees, he seemed to hear a voice saying, ""The just shall"
"live by faith."" Martin Luther rose from his knees, walked down the"
"staircase, and left the place a free man so far as this superstition"
"was concerned, and shortly afterwards became the most formidable foe"
that ever assailed the falsehood and corruption of the Romish Church.
[Sidenote: The Miraculous Portrait and the Shoes of Christ.]
At the top of the Scala Santa we saw through a grating the beautiful
silver tabernacle containing the great relic which has given to this
"chapel the name of _Sancta Sanctorum_, viz.: the portrait of Christ,"
"held by the Romish Church to be authentic, having been drawn in outline"
"by St. Luke and finished by an angel, whence its name ""Acheiropoëton,"""
"_i. e._, the picture made without hands. The relic chamber here"
"contains fragments of the true cross, the sandals of Christ, and ""the"
iron bar of Hades which he brought away with him from that doleful
"region,""[10] but we did not see these."
"[Sidenote: The Inscription on the Cross, and the Finger of Thomas.]"
A short walk beyond the Scala Santa and the Lateran brings us to the
"Church of S. Croce in Gerusalemme, which is specially rich in relics."
Here our party was shown a piece of the true cross of Christ and the
far from _The Bedford Castle_.
"To Marsh, already furious at the trick the ice had played him, this"
forced proximity to his rival brought home with added irony the fact
"that he had been forestalled, while it emphasized his knowledge that"
henceforth the conflict would be carried on at closer quarters. It
"would be a contest between two men, both determined to win by fair"
means or foul.
"Emerson was a dream-dazzled youth, striving like a knight-errant for"
"the love of a lady and the glory of conquest, but he was also a born"
"fighter, and in every emergency he had shown himself as able as his"
experienced opponent.
As Marsh looked about and saw how much Boyd's well-directed energy was
"accomplishing, he was conscious of a slight disheartenment. Still, he"
"was on his own ground, he had the advantage of superior force, and"
though he was humiliated by his failure to throttle the hostile
"enterprise in its beginning, he was by no means at the end of his"
"expedients. He was curious to see his rival in action, and he decided"
to visit him and test his temper.
"It was on the afternoon following his arrival that Marsh, after a tour"
"of inspection, landed from his launch and strolled up to where Boyd"
"Emerson was at work. He was greeted courteously, if a bit coolly, and"
"found, as on their last meeting, that his own bearing was reflected"
"exactly in that of Boyd. Both men, beneath the scant politeness of"
"their outward manner, were aware that the time for ceremony had passed."
Here in the Northland they faced each other at last as man to man.

"that was Old Washington. Twelve hours before, they had revealed things"
"as eerily beautiful, and as ravaged, in Asia and Russia. They pinked"
the white walls of the Colonial dwelling of Morton Opperly near the
Institute for Advanced Studies; upstairs they slanted impartially
across the Pharoahlike and open-eyed face of the elderly physicist and
"the ugly, sleep-surly one of young Willard Farquar in the next room."
And in nearby New Washington they made of the spire of the Thinkers'
"Foundation a blue and optimistic glory that outshone White House, Jr."
It was America approaching the end of the Twentieth Century. America
of juke-box burlesque and your local radiation hospital. America
of the mask-fad for women and Mystic Christianity. America of the

"his knowledge. It was a somewhat shadowy vision, but, he noted with"
"impartial approval, definitely less shadowy than yesterday morning."
"Employing a rapid mental scanning technique, he next cleared his memory"
"chains of false associations, including those acquired while asleep."
"These chores completed, he held his finger on a bedside button, which"
interest in normal stories is difficult to rouse. I will not here dwell
"on the deleterious effects of over dramatic stimulation, which has been"
"known to lead to crime, since I am keener to prevent the telling of too"
many sensational stories than to suggest a cure when the mischief is
done. Kate Douglas Wiggin has said:
"“Let us be realistic, by all means, but beware, O Story-teller, of"
being too realistic. Avoid the shuddering tale of ‘the wicked boy who
"stoned the birds,’ lest some hearer should be inspired to try the"
dreadful experiment and see if it really does kill.”
"I must emphasise the fact, however, that it is only the excess of"
this dramatic element which I deplore. A certain amount of excitement
is necessary; but this question belongs to the positive side of the
"subject, and I shall deal with it later on."
V.--_Stories presenting matters quite outside the plane of the child_
"(unless they are wrapped in mystery, which is of great educational"
value).
The element I wish to eliminate is the one which would make children
world-wise and old before their time.
A small American child who had entertained a guest in her mother's
"absence, when questioned as to whether she had shown all the"
"hospitality the mother would have considered necessary, said: “Oh! yes."
And I talked to her in the kind of ‘dressy’ tone _you_ use on your ‘At
Home’ days.”
"On one occasion I was lecturing in the town of Cleveland, and was to"
"stay in the house of a lady whom I had met only once, in New York, but"
with true American hospitality she had begged me to make her house my

My object in dismissing her was to make a thorough search of the
"apartment, in order to discover whether any of Yolande's private"
possessions were there.  She had been denounced by Kaye and Anderson as
"a spy, and it occurred to me that I might possibly discover the truth."
But she was dead.  The painful fact seemed absolutely incredible.
"The room was not a large one, but well furnished, with considerable"
"taste and elegance.  There was the broad, silk-covered couch, upon which"
Yolande had sat in the full possession of health and spirits only a
"couple of hours before; the skin rug, upon which her tiny foot had been"
"stretched so coquettishly; the small table, by which she had stood"
supporting herself after I had made the fatal announcement that Wolf was
in Paris.
As I stood there the whole of that strangely dramatic scene occurred to
me.  Yet she was dead--dead!  She had died with her secret in her heart.
"At any moment Dick Deane might arrive, but I desired to be the first to"
"make an examination of the room, and with that object crossed to the"

unsuspecting winter visitors.  It was the only piece of incongruous
"furniture in the room, all the rest being genuine Louis Quatorze."

thunderbolt of war. But as I saw him taking papers from women's hands
"at the end of the Burg Strasse, he had rather the air of a quiet,"
"worthy prince--of Coburg or Darmstadt, it might be,--no dresser and no"
"brawler; nor would any one, to see him then, have thought that this"
was the lion of the north who had dashed the pride of Pappenheim and
flung aside the firebrands of the south. Or that even now he had on
his shoulders the burden of two great nations and the fate of a
million of men.
CHAPTER XXVI.
THE FACE AT THE WINDOW.
After this it fared with us as it fares at last with the driftwood
that chance or the woodman's axe has given to a forest stream in
Heritzburg. After rippling over the shallows and shooting giddily down
"slopes--or perchance lying cooped for days in some dark bend, until"
the splash of the otter or the spring freshet has sent it dancing on
in sunshine and shadow--it reaches at last the Werra. It floats out on
"the bosom of the great stream, and no longer tossed and chafed by each"
"tiny pebble, feels the force of wind and stream--the great forces of"
"the world. The banks recede from sight, and one of a million atoms, it"
"is borne on gently and irresistibly, whither it does not know. So it"
was with us. From the day we fell in with Count Leuchtenstein and set
"And, when they had read, they all looked at him again, not as they had"
"looked before, but, it seemed to him, with a curious wonder, half"
"mocking, half pitying, as one looks at a man who does not know the thing"
that touches him most nearly. He glanced up at the galleries: there too
was the ubiquitous sheet; the Chief Justice and the President of the
"Legislative Council were cheek by jowl over it, and it fell lightly from"
"Lady Eynesford's slim fingers, to be caught at eagerly by Eleanor"
Scaife.
"""What is it?"" he whispered impatiently to Norburn; but his absorbed"
"disciple only bewilderedly murmured ""What?"" and the Premier could not"
pause to tell him.
Now followed what Sir Robert maintained was the greatest feat of oratory
"he had ever witnessed. Gathering his wandering wits together, Medland"
"plunged again whole-heartedly into his speech, and slowly, gradually,"
"almost, it seemed, step by step and man by man, he won back the thoughts"
of his audience. He wrestled with that strange paper rival and overthrew
it. Man after man dropped it; its course was stayed; it fell underfoot
"or fluttered idly down the gangways. The nods ceased, the whispers were"
"hushed, the stir fell and rose no more. Once again he had them, and,"
"inspired by that knowledge, the surest spur of eloquence, there rang"
"from his lips the last burning words, the picture of the vision that"
"ruled his life, the hope for the days that he might not see."
"""Believe!"" he cried, in passionate entreaty, ""believe, and your sons"
"shall surely see!"""
"He sank in his seat, and the last echo of his resonant voice died away."
"First came silence, and then a thunder of applause. Men stood up and"
"waved what they had in their hands, hats or handkerchiefs or papers;"
"women sat with their eyes still on him, or, with a gasp, leant back and"
"was a reinforcement of foot from Fulda, rank upon rank of shambling"
"men trailing long pikes, and footsore, and parched as they were,"
getting over the ground in a wonderful fashion. After them would come
"a long string of waggons, bearing corn, and hay, and malt, and wines;"
"all lurching slowly forward, slowly southward; often delayed, for"
"every quarter of a mile a horse fell or an axle broke, yet getting"
forward.
"And then the most wonderful sight of all, a regiment of Swedish horse"
"passed us, marching from Erfurt. All their horses were grey, and all"
"their head-pieces, backs and breasts of black metal, matched one"
another. As they came on through the dust with a tramp which shook the
"ground, they sang, company by company, to the music of drums and"
"trumpets, a hymn, 'Versage nicht, du Häuflein klein!' Behind them a"
"line of light waggons carried their wives and children, also singing."
"And so they went by us, eight hundred swords, and I thought it a"
marvel I should never see beaten.
"When they were gone out of sight, there were still droves of horses"
"and mighty flocks of sheep to come, and cargoes of pork, and more foot"
and horse and guns. Some companies wore buff coats and small steel
"caps, and carried arquebuses; and some marched smothered in huge"
headpieces with backs and breasts to match. And besides all the
things I have mentioned and the crowds of sutlers and horse-boys that
"went with them, there were munition waggons closely guarded, and"
"pack-horses laden with powder, and always and always waggons of corn"
and hay.
"And all hurrying, jostling, crawling southwards. It seemed to me that"
the world was marching southwards; that if we went on we must fall in
at the end of this with every one we knew. And the thought comforted
me.
"handkerchief edged with lace, unfolded it, and with the most ineffable"
"gesture in the world wiped the place the lady's hand had touched. Then,"
"with the same abiding calm, he restored the cambric to his pocket, bowed"
"low to the Queen, and lounged majestically towards the door."
Maria Cristina watched him at first with a haughty and unmoved
"countenance. Her hands clenched themselves close to her side, as if she"
wished the blow had been bestowed with the shut rather than with the
open digits.
"But as her husband (for so he really was, though the relationship was"
"not acknowledged till many years after, and at the feet of the Holy"
"Father himself in the Vatican) approached the door, opened it, and was"
"on the point of departing without once turning round, Cristina suddenly"
"broke into a half hysterical cry, ran after him, threw her arms tenderly"
"about his neck, and burst out weeping on his broad bosom."
"The gentleman, without betraying the least emotion, patted her"
"tolerantly on the shoulder, and murmured some words in her ear, at the"
same time looking over her head at the men of the company with a sort of
half-comic apology.
"""Oh! Fernando, forgive me,"" she cried, ""life of my life--the devil must"
have possessed me! I will cut off the wicked hand that did the deed.
"Give me a knife, good people--to strike the best and handsomest--oh, it"
"was wicked--cruel, diabolical!"""
"Whatever may have been the moral qualities of the royal blow, Rollo felt"
that in their present circumstances time enough had been given to its
"consideration, so he interposed."
"""Your Majesty, the gipsies may be upon us at any moment. It would be as"
"she read very stiltedly, with a strange exotic accent for the love"
"passages or the death scenes. As Lady Victoria Freebooter said, she"
would have been _priceless_ at a music-hall matinée which was
"raising funds for war charities, if only she could have been induced"
to read passages from Miss Yonge in _that_ voice for a quarter of an
hour. Even the Queen would have had to laugh.
"But as that could not be brought off, it was decided that working"
parties at her house led to too much giddiness from suppressed
giggles or torpor from too much food. So she relapsed once more into
loneliness. Unfortunately air-raids were now becoming events of
"occasional fright and anxiety in London, and this deterred Cousin"
"Sophie from Darlington, Cousin Matty from Leeds, Joseph's wife from"
"Northallerton or old, married schoolfellows from other northern or"
"midland towns coming to partake of her fastuous hospitality. Also,"
"they all seemed to be busy, either over their absent husbands'"
"business, or their sons', or because they were plunged in war work"
"themselves. ""And really, in these times, I couldn't stand Linda for"
"more than five minutes,"" one of them said."
"As to the air-raids, she was not greatly alarmed at them. Of course"
"it was very uncomfortable having London so dark at night, but then"
"she only went out in the afternoon, and never in the evening. And"
the Germans seemed to be content and discriminating enough not to
"bomb what she called ""the resi_den_tial"" parts of London. The"
nearest to Portland Place of their attentions was Hampstead or
"Bloomsbury. ""We are protected, my dear, by the open spaces of"
"Regent's Park. They wouldn't like to waste their bombs on poor me!"""
However her maid didn't altogether like the off chance of the
Germans or our air-craft guns making a mistake and trespassing on
"the residential parts of London, so she persuaded her mistress to"
"I had no authority to compel him to go on, so gave up the struggle."
But I realised more than ever how imperative it was to endeavour
"to reach Robat without a moment's unnecessary delay, and start"
"conclusions with the Raiders, whose menace was growing more dangerous"
every day.
"We were, therefore, on the road very early next morning, for I hoped"
"to make Saindak that night. I had intended to go by Borgar, but now"
"that I knew--for I had verified the contractor's statements, and"
believed them to be correct--that that place was in the hands of
"the Raiders, I elected to go by an alternative route, known as the"
"_Webb-Ware_ route, which is practically out of use nowadays, hoping,"
"thereby, to avoid the enemy."
It was still dark when we set off on the most strenuous part of our
"journey; climbing, making détours, digging the car out again and"
again till we were all three worn out in body and temper. We hardly
"halted that day, for the necessity for speed was as fully realised by"
Allan as by myself.
"When night fell we had not yet sighted Saindak, but I knew we could"
"not be very far off, and cursed the coming of the night which made"
it impossible to see where we were. I knew we had got off the camel
"track somehow, for the ground was even more bumpy than it had been,"
"and was frequently intersected by nullahs or rocky ravines, which"
made the going positively dangerous. If the car were knocked right
out of action our difficulties would reach the last stage of disaster.
"At last, in despair, Allan stopped, saying it was useless going on"
any further. We might overturn the car at any moment and smash it as
well as ourselves. He submitted that the only sane thing would be to
"concern her. The death of her mother had been a stunning shock, and"
"when she crossed over to the hotel--what irony, by the bye, to think"
"she had been born there thirty-nine years ago, in the old inn that"
had preceded the twice rebuilt hotel!--when she crossed the street
"with Minna, it had been with blazing, tearless eyes and the desire"
"to take the hotel manager and his minions by the coat collar, fling"
"_them_ into the street, and assert her right to go up to her room."
"But now her violence was spent and she was a broken, weeping woman"
"as she sat all night by the bedside of her dead mother, holding the"
"cold hand, imprinting kisses on the dead face which was now that of"
a saintly person with nothing of the reprobate in its lineaments.
*       *       *       *       *
The burial for various reasons had to take place in the Cemetery of
"St. Josse-ten-Noode, near the shuddery National Shooting Range where"
Edith Cavell and numerous Belgian patriots had recently been
"executed. Minna von Stachelberg left her hospital, with some one"
"else in charge, and insisted on accompanying Vivie to the interment."
"This might have been purely ""laïc""; not on account of any harsh"
dislike to the religious ceremony on Vivie's part; only due to the
fact that she knew no priest or pastor. But there appeared at the
grave-side to make a very suitable and touching discourse and to
"utter one or two heartfelt prayers, a Belgian Baptist minister, a"
relation of Mme. Trouessart.
Waterloo left many curious things behind it. Not only a tea-shop or
"two; but a Nonconformist nucleus, that intermarried, as Sergeant"
"Walker or Walcker had done, with Belgian women and left descendants"
"who in the third generation--and by inherent vigour, thrift,"
matrimony and conversion--had built up quite a numerous
"congregation, which even grew large enough and rich enough to"
CHAPTER XVII
THE GERMANS IN BRUSSELS: 1915-1916
"In the early spring of 1915, Vivie, anxious not to see her mother in"
"utter penury, and despairing of any effective assistance from the"
Americans (very much prejudiced against her for the reasons already
"mentioned), took her mother's German and Belgian securities of a"
"face value amounting to about £18,000 and sold them at her Belgian"
"bank for a hundred thousand francs (£4,000) in Belgian or German"
"bank notes. She consulted no one, except her mother. Who was there"
to consult? She did not like to confide too much to Colonel von
"Giesselin, a little too prone in any case to ""protect"" them. But as"
"she argued with Mrs. Warren, what else were they to do in their"
"cruel situation? If the Allies were eventually victorious, Mrs."
Warren could return to England. There at least she had in safe
"investments £40,000, ample for the remainder of their lives. If"
"Germany lost the War, the German securities nominally worth two"
hundred thousand marks might become simply waste paper; even now
they were only computed by the bank at a purchase value of about one
fifth what they had stood at before the War. If Germany were
"victorious or agreed to a compromise peace, her mother's shares in"
Belgian companies might be unsaleable. Better to secure now a lump
sum of four thousand pounds in bank notes that would be legal
"currency, at any rate as long as the German occupation lasted. And"
"as one never knew what might happen, it was safer still to have all"
"this money (equivalent to a hundred thousand francs), in their own"
"keeping. They could live even in war time, on such a sum as this"
"for four, perhaps five years, as they would be very economical and"
Vivie would try to earn all she could by teaching. It was useless to
hope they would be able to return to Villa Beau-séjour so long as
"largely, if not entirely, by reason of its reversion to classical"
principles and devices.
"We have insisted on the difference between Tragedy and Pathos, and"
criticized the weakening effect of the latter upon the former. To escape
the penalty that awaits general criticism we may add here that Tragedy
is never greater than when her handmaid is ready to do her _modest_
"service. Sophocles puts into the mouth of Oedipus, at the moment of his"
"departure into blind and desolate exile, tender injunctions regarding"
the care of his young daughters:
"But my poor maidens, hapless and forlorn,"
"Who never had a meal apart from mine,"
"But ever shared my table, yea, for them"
"Take heedful care; and grant me, though but once,"
"Yea, I beseech thee, with these hands to feel,"
"Thou noble heart! the forms I love so well,"
And weep with them our common misery.
"Oh, if my arms were round them, I might seem"
To have them as of old when I could see.[52]
"Shakespeare, too, knew well how to kindle the soft radiance which,"
"fading again, makes the ensuing darkness darker still. Ophelia, the"
"sleeping Duncan, Cordelia rise to our minds. Nor need we quote the"
famous words of Webster's Ferdinand. It is enough that the greatest
scene in _Gorboduc_ is precisely that scene where pathos softens by a
momentary dimness of vision our horror at a mother's crime.
"_The Misfortunes of Arthur_ (1587), by Thomas Hughes, though twenty-five"
"years later, may be placed next to _Gorboduc_ in our discussion of the"
rise of tragedy. It will serve as an illustration of the kind of tragedy
that was being evolved from Senecan models by plodding uninspired
"for me and I mustn't delay him. How long will you be?"""
"""What sort of news is it?"" asked Sallie, no less dubious than her maid"
"had been; and called her maid in, notwithstanding her well-founded"
doubts as to the nature of any news he could bring. For Slyne had held
"out to her the same lure that the serpent offered to Eve, and her"
womanly curiosity would not allow her to order him at once from her
domain.
"Slyne smiled slightly as he sat down in a basket-chair, to look about"
him while she was still busy within. The little after-saloon which had
"been her home for so long was finely furnished; more so, perhaps, than"
"was apparent to Slyne, whose taste in that respect inclined to the"
florid. But he could not help noticing how dainty and neat and feminine
"was its entire effect, with its cushioned cosy corners, snow-white"
curtains and draperies. Its purely fragrant atmosphere stirred even
Slyne's conscience a little.
"He lay back in his seat, and, gazing about him, recalled to mind all he"
had been able to learn as to Sallie's strange past. It all fitted in so
perfectly with the fabric of his wonderful new plans that he could find
no possible flaw in them. And when Sallie herself at length came out to
"him from her cabin, he was optimistically disposed to be very generous"
in his dealings with her.
"Fresh from her bath and doubly bewitching in her clinging, intimate"
"draperies, she met Slyne's glad, eager glance with grave, doubtful eyes,"
and ignored entirely the hand he held out to her as he sprang from his
"chair. But he affected not to notice her attitude of distrust, and,"
"greeting her gaily, saved his face by laying his outstretched hand on"
"another chair, which he set a little nearer his own."
"“Then I’ll go,” Frank decided. “I don’t like the idea of sitting around"
"the camp and letting you boys have all the fun. Besides,” he continued,"
"“if it is the messenger who is making the signals, you’ll need all the"
help you can get.”
"“Come running, then!” advised Jack, starting down the slope."
"As the reader will remember, the signal observed by the boys had been"
"built by Jimmie in the hope of attracting the attention of Ned, or of"
"Norman, the boy who had made himself so conspicuous that morning. In"
building the fires and creating the columns of dense white smoke by
"heaping on green boughs, the boy had not given serious thought to the"
effect his action might have on his chums.
"In fact, at the time of his leaving camp, he had not fully decided what"
"course to pursue, and for this reason he had not informed the boys of"
his intention to set a signal for the benefit of the mysterious Boy
"Scout. Even at the time of making the signal, he had no idea that it"
would actually draw his three chums away from the camp.
"He might have known what the effect would be, but, though he did stop to"
"consider for a moment, he did not take in the whole situation. Jimmie"
"usually acted on impulse, and so the signal lifted to the sky without"
any explanation having been made to the Boy Scouts who were certain to
see it.
It will be remembered that when Jimmie descended from the elevation
where the fires had been built he did so in order to hasten in the
direction of a smoke signal which he saw to the north. The result of
this was that he was out of the vicinity of the fires long before the
boys reached that point.
"Thus, even at the beginning of the Paleozoic, the continental"
plateau of North America had already been left by crustal
movements in relief above the abysses of the great oceans on
"either side. The mediterraneans which lay upon it were shallow, as"
"their sediments prove. They were EPICONTINENTAL SEAS; that is,"
"they rested UPON (Greek, EPI) the submerged portion of the"
continental plateau. We have no proof that the deep ocean ever
occupied any part of where North America now is.
The Middle and Upper Cambrian strata are found together with the
Lower Cambrian over the area of both the eastern and the western
"mediterraneans, so that here the sea continued during the entire"
period. The sediments throughout are those of shoal water. Coarse
cross-bedded sandstones record the action of strong shifting
currents which spread coarse waste near shore and winnowed it of
finer stuff. Frequent ripple marks on the bedding planes of the
strata prove that the loose sands of the sea floor were near
enough to the surface to be agitated by waves and tidal currents.
Sun cracks show that often the outgoing tide exposed large muddy
"flats to the drying action of the sun. The fossils, also, of the"
strata are of kinds related to those which now live in shallow
waters near the shore.
The sediments which gathered in the mediterranean seas were very
"thick, reaching in places the enormous depth of ten thousand feet."
"Hence the bottoms of these seas were sinking troughs, ever filling"
with waste from the adjacent land as fast as they subsided.
LATE CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. The formations of the Middle and Upper
Cambrian are found resting unconformably on the pre-Cambrian rocks
from New York westward into Minnesota and at various points in the
"by Russia and France, to come out to the Far East, especially because"
the Russian fleets have ceased to exist. I admit that the German fleet
"is strong, but I do not believe it is powerful enough for one to say"
"with certainty that it can easily crush Japan. At all events, what"
pretext has Germany to enter into war in the Far East? Among other
things also she would have to count on the opinion and sentiments of two
"countries at least, I mean England and the United States. I do not,"
"therefore, consider a new combination possible. Japan cannot be"
intimidated by mere barking.
"If, however, Europe should choose to take such a course, we should"
gravely reflect. I do not believe your country for example would ever
undertake an expedition against Japan. You have disapproved a small
expedition to Tonkin and we are a little more serious than the
"Tonkinese. France might no doubt, if her honour demanded it, judge it"
"worth the pain to engage in a war with Japan, but under no other"
circumstance do I believe her disposed to take such a part.
Japan will always continue to advance on the lines of occidental
civilisation. I do not see the reason which will prevent Japan from
"acting in concert with France or Germany, provided of course these"
powers do not enter upon an action which may appear to her altogether
"unjust or iniquitous, in which case she may not be able to march with"
them hand-in-hand.
Would Japan be offended by France introducing civilisation into
Indo-China?
We are not at all opposed to your introducing Western civilisation into
"your colonies. On the contrary we shall be quite contented, but in"
introducing your civilisation into your colonies you have to be prepared
that it signifies an amelioration of the condition of the natives. If it
The stereo pattern in the Information Center of Commodore Ted Wilson's
flagship was slowly being filled with the hazy white that indicated
"that these volumes had been combed carefully. As he watched, he could"
"see how the search was progressing, and it was painfully obvious that"
the search was not going good at all.
The flights of spacecraft in set patterns back and forth through the
stereo had covered nearly all of the truncated space cone. The random
search ships were slowly cutting secondary lines through the regions
already covered. There was a green sphere combing the stereo pattern
"now, indicating the new infrawave detector ship and its expected volume"
of detector coverage.
Space was filled to overflowing with the fast patter of the
"communications officers, using infrawave for talks between flights, and"
ordinary radio for talks between ships of the same flight.
Wilson had appointed Chief Communications Officer Haggerty to police
"the bands. Haggerty had done a fine job, removing the howling confusion"
and interference caused from too many calls on the same channel. But
the result was still a high degree of constant call and reply and
"cross talk. Most of the chatter came from the infrawave detector ship,"
sending the scout craft flitting hither and thither on the trail of
spurious responses.
It was almost impossible to grasp the extent of the operation. Only in
"the stereo pattern could anybody begin to follow the complex operation,"
and those who watched the stereo knew that their pattern was only an
idealized space map of what they hoped was going on.
It was worse than combing the area of an ocean from maps that contained
a neat grid of cross rules. Much worse. For the uncharted ocean is
stood beside Socrates. And Beatus Rhenanus devotes to him a life of
earnest admiration and helpfulness that was to prove of much more value
than these exuberant panegyrics. There is an element of national
exaltation in this German enthusiasm for Erasmus: it is the violently
stimulated mood into which Luther's word will fall anon.
"The other nations also chimed in with praise, though a little later and"
"a little more soberly. Colet and Tunstall promise him immortality,"
"Étienne Poncher exalts him above the celebrated Italian humanists,"
Germain de Brie declares that French scholars have ceased reading any
"authors but Erasmus, and Budaeus announces that all Western Christendom"
resounds with his name.
This increase of glory manifested itself in different ways. Almost every
"year the rumour of his death was spread abroad, malignantly, as he"
"himself thinks. Again, all sorts of writings were ascribed to him in"
"which he had no share whatever, amongst others the _Epistolae obscurorum"
virorum_.
"But, above all, his correspondence increased immensely. The time was"
long since past when he asked More to procure him more correspondents.
"Letters now kept pouring in to him, from all sides, beseeching him to"
reply. A former pupil laments with tears that he cannot show a single
note written by Erasmus. Scholars respectfully sought an introduction
"from one of his friends, before venturing to address him. In this"
"respect Erasmus was a man of heroic benevolence, and tried to answer"
"what he could, although so overwhelmed by letters every day that he"
"hardly found time to read them. 'If I do not answer, I seem unkind,'"
"says Erasmus, and that thought was intolerable."
"We should bear in mind that letter-writing, at that time, occupied more"
"or less the place of the newspaper at present, or rather of the literary"
"After reading the letter, I felt sure that the Abbé du Boise was George"
Hamilton. I could hardly bring myself to believe that he would be so
"foolhardy as to visit Whitehall, though I knew the adventure was of a"
nature likely to appeal to his reckless disregard of consequences. I
"knew also that, if successful, he would win the reward without which"
life had little value to him.
I was sure that Hamilton had fully weighed the danger of his perilous
"mission, and that he was deliberately staking his life on a last"
desperate chance to win fortune and Frances Jennings.
"Though perhaps Lilly was a charlatan in many respects, he was to be"
trusted; still I did not feel that it was my place to impart George's
"secret to him, though I had in mind a plan whereby he might be of great"
help to the Abbé du Boise in influencing King Charles. The king consulted
"him secretly in many important affairs, and I was sure that if the good"
"Doctor should be called in by his Majesty in the Dunkirk affair, the"
stars would tell a story in accord with our desires if we made it to
Lilly's interest.
"However, all of that must wait for the Abbé du Boise. Of one thing I was"
sure; I must tell Frances at once so that she might be paving the way to
"the king with her smiles. It would be a disagreeable task, but I knew she"
"would do it gladly, and I also knew that no woman could do it better."
While I had expressed my doubts to Frances concerning Hamilton's
"emigration to Canada, I had not felt entirely sure there was nothing in"
"it, and she, womanlike, taking the worst for granted, had accepted it as"
"true. But the coming of the Abbé du Boise changed everything, and when I"
"saw her at her father's house and told her of my suspicions, and showed"
"her Le Blanc's letter, she was so greatly alarmed that she said she would"
on his bent neck and promptly slithered inside his collar and down
his back.
Unfortunately the commander was a man of a most ticklish temperament.
The contact of the metal disc with his back caused him to writhe like
a lost soul in torment. He had recently unflinchingly faced death in
"a hotly-contested engagement in the North Sea, but this rear attack"
completely unnerved him. His grotesque efforts to capture the elusive
coin was too much for the rest of the officers and men. They were
unable to conceal their amusement. Finally the commander dived down
below and divested himself of his uniform.
"Just then the ship's steward appeared with the tin of condensed milk,"
and handed the unopened can to a seaman. Away aloft the man made his
"way till he gained the cross-trees. Owing to the ""Sunderland"""
"altering her course she was swinging considerably to starboard, and"
"the motion made the man advance cautiously, his feet sliding along"
the foot-ropes while he held on grimly with his free hand to the
spar.
Mephisto eyed the approaching delicacy with marked approval. Letting
"the remaining coins drop, some of which tinkled on deck although most"
"of them fell overboard, he whisked along the yard-arm, and before the"
"seaman realized the brute's intention, snatched the can from his"
grasp.
A snarl warned the bluejacket that if he advanced it would be at his
"peril, and unwilling to risk an encounter with an agile monkey on the"
"swaying yard, he followed the precept of discretion being the better"
"part of valour, and regained the deck, leaving the spoils in the"
hands of the elated ape.
"numbed by the nerve-racking concussion. Then, as the smoke drifted"
"away, he could discern the débris of the bridge. Charthouse,"
"stanchions, semaphore, signal-lockers--all had vanished, and with"
them the captain and those of the officers and men who had dared fate
"by rejecting the shelter afforded by the conning-tower, which,"
"stripped of its surroundings, stood out a gaunt, fire-pitted steel"
box.
"The shell, a 42-centimetre, had literally cleared the forepart of the"
"ship, from the for'ard 6-inch gun to the second funnel. Everything in"
"its path had been literally pulverized, with the exception of the"
conning-tower. Had the projectile burst on or below the main deck the
"fate of the ""Sunderland"" would have been sealed; as it was, she was"
still intact under the waterline.
Instinctively Aubyn realized that the ship was not under control.
"Steaming rapidly she was heading towards the ""Bradford""--her sister"
ship--which was steering in a north-easterly direction at about five
cables' distance on her port bow.
With a tremendous effort of will-power Terence cleared at a bound the
formidable glowing plate of metal that obstructed his path. Making
"his way across the scorched and splintered planks, some of which gave"
"under his weight, he reached the entrance to the conning-tower."
The steel citadel was full of acrid-smelling smoke that eddied in the
air-currents which drifted in through the observation slits.
"Bending, and holding his left hand over his mouth and nostrils,"
Terence entered. As he did so he stumbled over the body of the
quartermaster.

[Sidenote: The Benefits of Buying a Fac-simile of the Chains.]
In the sacristy we found a young priest doing a thriving business in
"copies of the relic. We bought from him ""an iron _fac-simile_ of the"
"chains (about the size of an ordinary watch-chain), authenticated by a"
certificate testifying to its having touched the original chains. On
the back of this certificate was printed an extract from the Rules of
"the Confraternity of the chains of St. Peter, from which we learned"
that all associates in this brotherhood must wear such a _fac-simile_
"as we had just bought, that the objects of the Confraternity are ""The"
"propagation of the veneration of the chains of St. Peter, an increase"
"of devotion to the Holy See, prayers for the Pope's intention, for the"
"needs of Holy Church, the conversion of infidels and sinners, and the"
"extirpation of heresy and blasphemy,"" and that Pius IX. had granted to"
"the members of the Confraternity various indulgences, one of which is"
"""_A plenary indulgence and remission of all sins_[14] if one visits the"
"Church of San Pietro in Vincoli on January 18th[15] and June 29th,[16]"
"between the first vespers of the feast and sunset of the said days,"
"or on August 1st, or any one of the seven days following it. The usual"
"prayers for the Holy Father's intention,"" etc., are comprised in these"
"visits. We are told also that ""the foregoing indulgences are applicable"
"to the souls in purgatory."""
[Sidenote: The Relics in St. Peter's Cathedral.]
We may close this running account of the relics at Rome with a brief
"mention of those that are to be seen in St. Peter's itself, the largest"
and costliest church in the world. The construction of it extended
over one hundred and seventy-six years. The cost of the main building
alone was fifty million dollars. The annual outlay for repairs is
"_T. Trusty._ Ye say full true, i-wis."
"In 1566 was acted at Christ's College, Cambridge, 'A Ryght Pithy,"
"Pleasaunt, and merie Comedie, intytuled _Gammer Gurton's Needle_.' The"
"authorship is uncertain, recent investigation having exalted a certain"
Stevenson into rivalry with the Bishop Still to whom former scholars
were content to assign it. Possibly as the result of a perusal of
"Plautus, possibly under the influence of the last play--for in subject"
matter it is even more perfectly English than _Ralph Roister
"Doister_--this comedy is also built on a well-arranged plan, the plot"
developing regularly through five acts with subsidiary scenes. Let us
glance through it.
"Gammer Gurton and her goodman Hodge lose their one and only needle, an"
"article not easily renewed, nor easily done without, seeing that Hodge's"
"garments stand in need of instant repair. Gib, the cat, is strongly"
"suspected of having swallowed it. Into this confusion steps Diccon, a"
"bedlam beggar, whose quick eye promptly detects opportunities for"
"mischief. After scaring Hodge with offers of magic art, he goes to Dame"
"Chat, an honest but somewhat jealous neighbour, unaware of what has"
"happened, with a tale that Gammer Gurton accuses her of stealing her"
best cock. To Gammer Gurton he announces that he has seen Dame Chat pick
up the needle and make off with it. Between the two dames ensues a
"meeting, the nature of which may be guessed, the whole trouble lying in"
the fact that neither thinks it necessary to name the article under
dispute. No wonder that discussion under the disadvantage of so great a
"misunderstanding ends in violence. Doctor Rat, the curate, is now called"
in; but again Diccon is equal to the occasion. Having warned Dame Chat
"that Hodge, to balance the matter of the cock, is about to creep in"
"through a breach in the wall and kill her chickens, he persuades Doctor"
Rat that if he will creep through this same opening he will see the
needle lying on Dame Chat's table. The consequences for the curate are
"the fibula. While being carried off the field, a second bullet"
(Lee-Metford) entered immediately outside the left posterior
"superior iliac spine, perforated the pelvis, and emerged 1-1/2"
inch within the left anterior superior spine. The patient was
then put down and left on the field ten hours; later he was
"carried to shelter for the night, and arrived at Orange River"
"on the second day. He suffered with some pain in the abdomen,"
"especially during the journey in the train, but was not sick;"
the bowels were confined.
"When seen on the third day at 6 P.M., some pain was complained"
"of in the abdomen, which moved freely in the upper part, but"
was motionless below the umbilicus. No distension. Tenderness
around wound of exit and some rigidity. The bowels had acted
"four times during the day; motions loose, dark brown, and"
"containing no blood. Face not anxious, eyes bright, temperature"
"102°. Pulse 96, regular, and of good strength. Tongue moist and"
little furred.
"The abdomen was opened at 5 A.M. on the fourth day, as the"
"local signs had become more pronounced, and the patient had"
passed a restless night in great abdominal pain. A local
"incision was chosen, as the wound was presumably in the sigmoid"
flexure. The sigmoid flexure was adherent to the abdominal wall
"opposite the wound of exit, and a dark ecchymosed patch was"
"found, but no perforation could be detected. Foul pus and gas"
"escaped freely from the pelvis, but no wound of the large bowel"
could be discovered here. On enlarging the incision upwards
"three openings were found in a coil of jejunum, probably that"
about five feet from the duodenal junction usually provided
with the longest mesentery. No fourth opening could be found.
"The openings were circular, about 1/3 inch in diameter, clean"
The localised ecchymosis surrounding the apertures is quite
"characteristic of this form of injury, and is a valuable aid to finding"
the openings during an operation.
"Fig. 88 shows the interior of the same segment of bowel, as fig. 87. It"
"shows the localised ecchymosis as seen from the inner surface, here"
rather more extensive from the fact that the blood spreads more readily
in the submucous tissue.
[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Perforating Wounds of Small Intestine. A.
Entry; note circular outline and eversion of mucous membrane. B. Wound
"of exit; curved slit-like character, eversion of mucous membrane. Note"
"the localised ecchymosis, more abundant round exit aperture. (St."
Thomas's Hospital Museum)]
It will be noted that the main feature of the form of injury is the
regular outline and the small size of the wounds. Another feature not
illustrated by the figures should also be mentioned. In the ruptures of
intestine with which we are acquainted in civil practice the wound in
the gut is almost without exception situated at the free border of the
"bowel, but in these injuries it was just as frequently at the mesenteric"
"margin. The importance of this factor is considerable, since wounds"
near the mesenteric edge are much more likely to be accompanied by
"hæmorrhage, and thus the opportunity for diffusion of infection is"
"considerably multiplied, to say nothing of the danger from loss of"
blood.
"Beyond these more or less pure perforations, long slits or gutters were"
occasionally cut. I saw instances of these in the case of the ascending
"colon, and in the small curvature of the stomach. The comparative fixity"
of the portion of bowel struck is a matter of great importance in the
production of this form of injury.
In any case if India need to make any contribution to the world it
should be as great as the hope they cherished for her. Let them not
"talk of the glories of the past till they have secured for her, her true"
place among the intellectual nations of the world. Let them find out how
she had fallen from her high estate and ruthlessly put an end to all
that self satisfied and little-minded vanity which had been the cause of
their fatal weakness. What was it that stood in her way? Was her mind
paralysed by weak superstitious fears? That was not so; for her great
"thinkers, the Rishis, always stood for freedom of intellect and while"
"Galileo was imprisoned and Bruno burnt for their opinions, they boldly"
declared that even the Vedas were to be rejected if they did not conform
to truth. They urged in favour of persistent efforts for the discovery
"of physical causes yet unknown, since to them nothing was extra-physical"
but merely mysterious because of a hitherto unascertained cause. Were
they afraid that the march of knowledge was dangerous to true faith? Not
so. For their knowledge and religion were one.
These are the hopes that animate us. For there is something in the Hindu
culture which is possessed of extraordinary latent strength by which it
has resisted the ravages of time and the destructive changes which have
swept over the earth. And indeed a capacity to endure through infinite
transformations must be innate in that mighty civilisation which has
"seen the intellectual culture of the Nile Valley, of Assyria and of"
Babylon war and wane and disappear and which to-day gazes on the future
with the same invincible faith with which it met the past.
"--_Modern Review, vol. XIX, pages_ 277, 278."
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The physical history of the period is recorded
in the succession of its formations. The sandstones of the Upper
"Cambrian, as we have learned, tell of a transgressing sea which"
gradually came to occupy the Mississippi valley and the interior
of North America. The limestones of the early and middle
Ordovician show that now the shore had become remote and the lands
had become more low. The waters now had cleared. Colonies of
brachiopods and other lime-secreting animals occupied the sea
"bottom, and their debris mantled it with sheets of limy ooze. The"
sandy limestones of the Calciferous record the transition stage
from the Cambrian when some sand was still brought in from shore.
The highly fossiliferous limestones of the Trenton tell of clear
water and abundant life. We need not regard this epicontinental
"sea as deep. No abysmal deposits have been found, and the"
"limestones of the period are those which would be laid in clear,"
warm water of moderate depth like that of modern coral seas.
The shales of the Utica and Hudson show that the waters of the sea
now became clouded with mud washed in from land. Either the land
"was gradually uplifted, or perhaps there had arrived one of those"
"periodic crises which, as we may imagine, have taken place"
whenever the crust of the shrinking earth has slowly given way
"over its great depressions, and the ocean has withdrawn its waters"
into deepening abysses. The land was thus left relatively higher
and bordered with new coastal plains. The epicontinental sea was
"shoaled and narrowed, and muds were washed in from the adjacent"
lands.
THE TACONIC DEFORMATION. The Ordovician was closed by a
deformation whose extent and severity are not yet known. From the
"St. Lawrence River to New York Bay, along the northwestern and"
"western border of New England, lies a belt of Cambrian-Ordovician"
Have the overhand: in me it is verified.
"Pray for me, good people, I beseech you heartily,"
That the Lord above on my poor soul have mercy.
"Farewell noblemen, with the clergy spiritual,"
"Farewell men of law, with the whole commonalty."
"Your disobedience I do forgive you all,"
And desire God to pardon your iniquity.
"Farewell, sweet England, now last of all to thee:"
I am right sorry I could do for thee no more.
"Farewell once again, yea, farewell for evermore."
"Prompted by a different motive, yet not far removed in actual effect"
"from the politico-religious class of play represented by _New Custom_,"
are the early Interludes of John Heywood. It is quite impossible to read
such a play as _The Pardoner and the Friar_ and believe that its author
wrote under any such earnest and sober inspiration as did the author of
"_New Custom_. His intention was frankly to amuse, and to paint life as"
he saw it without the intrusion of unreal personages of highly virtuous
but dull ideas. Yet he swung the lash of satire as cuttingly and as
merrily about the flanks of ecclesiastical superstition as ever did the
creator of Perverse Doctrine.[47]
"The simplest plot sufficed Heywood, and the minimum of characters. _The"
Pardoner and the Friar_ (possibly as early as 1520) demands only four
"persons, while the plot may be summed up in a few sentences, thus: A"
"Pardoner and a Friar, from closely adjoining platforms, are endeavouring"
"to address the same crowd, the one to sell relics, the other to beg"
money for his order. By a sort of stichomythic alternation each for a
"time is supposed to carry on his speech regardless of the other, so that"
to follow either connectedly the alternate lines must be read in
"sequence. But every now and then they break off for abuse, and finally"
they fight. A Parson and neighbour Prat interfere to convey them to jail
involved in a series of polemics. To let the opposition of opponents
"pass unnoticed was forbidden not only by his character, for ever"
"striving to justify himself in the eyes of the world, but also by the"
"custom of his time, so eager for dispute."
"There were, first of all, his polemics with Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples,"
"or in Latinized form, Faber Stapulensis, the Parisian theologian, who as"
"a preparer of the Reformation may, more than anyone else, be ranked with"
Erasmus. At the moment when Erasmus got into the travelling cart which
"was to take him to Louvain, a friend drew his attention to a passage in"
"the new edition of Faber's commentary on St. Paul's epistles, in which"
"he controverted Erasmus's note on the Second Epistle to the Hebrews,"
"verse 7. Erasmus at once bought Faber's book, and soon published an"
"_Apologia_. It concerned Christ's relation to God and the angels, but"
"the dogmatic point at issue hinged, after all, on a philological"
interpretation of Erasmus.
"Not yet accustomed to much direct wrangling, Erasmus was violently"
"agitated by the matter, the more as he esteemed Faber highly and"
considered him a congenial spirit. 'What on earth has occurred to the
man? Have others set him on against me? All theologians agree that I am
"right,' he asserts. It makes him nervous that Faber does not reply again"
at once. Badius has told Peter Gilles that Faber is sorry about it.
Erasmus in a dignified letter appeals to their friendship; he will
suffer himself to be taught and censured. Then again he growls: Let him
be careful. And he thinks that his controversy with Faber keeps the
world in suspense: there is not a meal at which the guests do not side
with one or the other of them. But finally the combat abated and the
friendship was preserved.
"Towards Easter 1518, Erasmus contemplated a new journey to Basle, there"
"to pass through the press, during a few months of hard labour, the"
"immaculately and correctly clothed; calm, assured, handsome—in"
"appearance the typical New York young clubman setting out, slightly"
"bored, to inaugurate the pleasures of the evening."
Chandler’s honorarium was $18 per week. He was employed in the office
of an architect. He was twenty-two years old; he considered
architecture to be truly an art; and he honestly believed—though he
would not have dared to admit it in New York—that the Flatiron Building
was inferior in design to the great cathedral in Milan.
Out of each week’s earnings Chandler set aside $1. At the end of each
"ten weeks with the extra capital thus accumulated, he purchased one"
gentleman’s evening from the bargain counter of stingy old Father Time.
He arrayed himself in the regalia of millionaires and presidents; he
"took himself to the quarter where life is brightest and showiest, and"
"there dined with taste and luxury. With ten dollars a man may, for a"
"few hours, play the wealthy idler to perfection. The sum is ample for a"
"well-considered meal, a bottle bearing a respectable label,"
"commensurate tips, a smoke, cab fare and the ordinary etceteras."
This one delectable evening culled from each dull seventy was to
Chandler a source of renascent bliss. To the society bud comes but one
début; it stands alone sweet in her memory when her hair has whitened;
"but to Chandler each ten weeks brought a joy as keen, as thrilling, as"
new as the first had been. To sit among _bon vivants_ under palms in
"the swirl of concealed music, to look upon the _habitués_ of such a"
paradise and to be looked upon by them—what is a girl’s first dance and
short-sleeved tulle compared with this?
Up Broadway Chandler moved with the vespertine dress parade. For this
evening he was an exhibit as well as a gazer. For the next sixty-nine
evenings he would be dining in cheviot and worsted at dubious _table
as obediently as well-trained dogs. Most of them were of the usual
"dark-red colour, a trifle soiled with the grey dust on which they had"
"been lying. A few were white, and these were the favourites of the"
"little Queen, who, though compelled to go on ahead, looked constantly"
back over her shoulder and endeavoured to imitate the shrill whistling
call by which La Giralda kept her flock in place.
When they arrived at the palace front the doors stood wide open. At Doña
"Susana's call an ancient major-domo appeared, his well-developed"
waistcoat mating ill with the pair of shrunk and spindle shanks which
"appeared beneath. The sentry boxes, striped red and gold with the"
"colours of Spain, were empty. At the guard-houses there were no lounging"
sergeants or smart privates eager to rise and salute as the little Queen
passed by.
There was already indeed about the palace an air of desolation. The
"great gates in front towards the town had been closed, as if to shut off"
"infection, and the Court itself, dwindled to a few faithful old"
"retainers of Fernando VII., surrounded his widow and her new husband"
with a devotion which was yet far more than their due.
It was not long before La Giralda had milked the remainder of the flock
and sent the creaming white pitchers into the palace. Little Isabel
danced with delight as one she-goat after another escaped with infinite
tail-waggling and bleatings of pleasure. And in the dearth of other
amusement she desired and even commanded the old woman to remain and
pasture her herd within the precincts of the palace. But La Giralda had
much yet to do. She must find out the state and dispositions of the town
"of San Ildefonso, and then rejoin her companions in the little corrie or"
cauldron-like _cirque_ in which she and the sergeant had left Rollo and
the other members of the expedition.
but none could give the answer.

"A wild, wet September day was drawing to its close, amid pelting squalls"
"of cold rain, when a tall young man, gaunt and hollow-eyed, pushed his"
way into a small coffee-house in an obscure thoroughfare somewhere in
"the region of Drury Lane, and took a seat in a dark corner as near to"
"the stove as he could get, for he looked pinched with cold, and his"
plain and rather threadbare black suit was pretty well wet through.  As
"soon as he was seated, he drew from his breast a roll of paper, which he"
"regarded with solicitude.  That at least was dry, and he heaved a sigh"
that sounded like one of satisfaction.
"In this narrow street the daylight had completely faded, though it was"
not yet six o’clock.  The room was furthermore darkened by clouds of
tobacco smoke which the guests were puffing forth.  The smell of coffee
"mingled with the ranker fumes of the tobacco, and the clink of cup and"
"spoon made ceaseless accompaniment to the talk, which went on in a"
continuous stream.
"Grey (for it was he) leaned his head on his hand wearily, and fell into"
something like a doze as he sat in his shadowy corner.  He was exhausted
"in mind and in body.  He was faint with hunger, and yet half afraid to"
"order food; for his funds were dwindling almost to the vanishing point,"
and as yet he had found no means of replenishing his exchequer. But he
had not been able to resist the temptation to escape from the buffetings
"of the tempest, and when the boy in attendance upon the guests came to"
"ask his pleasure, he ordered some coffee and bread, and devoured it with"
a ravenous appetite when it was set before him.
"The pangs of hunger stayed, if not appeased, he began to look about him,"
And thus they speak till far on in the night or till they have
"quarrelled, the usual result of drink or of passions engendered by such"
discussions.
"The rain beats on the windows, and outside the cold wind is blowing."
"The eating-house is close with tobacco smoke, but it is warm, while the"
"street is cold and wet.  Now and then, the wind beats threateningly on"
"the windows of the eating-house, as if bidding these men to come out"
and be scattered like dust over the face of the earth.  Sometimes a
stifled and hopeless groan is heard in its howling which again is
"drowned by cold, cruel laughter.  This music fills one with dark, sad"
"thoughts of the approaching winter, with its accursed short, sunless"
"days and long nights, of the necessity of possessing warm garments and"
plenty to eat.  It is hard to sleep through the long winter nights on
"an empty stomach.  Winter is approaching.  Yes, it is approaching..."
How to live?
These gloomy forebodings created a strong thirst among the inhabitants
"of the main street, and the sighs of the ""creatures that once were men"""
"increased with the wrinkles on their brows, their voices became thick"
and their behaviour to each other more blunt.  And brutal crimes were
"committed among them, and the roughness of these poor unfortunate"
"outcasts was apt to increase at the approach of that inexorable enemy,"
who transformed all their lives into one cruel farce.  But this enemy
could not be captured because it was invisible.
"Then they began beating each other brutally, and drank till they had"
drunk everything which they could pawn to the indulgent Vaviloff.  And
"thus they passed the autumn days in open wickedness, in suffering which"
"was eating their hearts out, unable to rise out of this vicious life"
and in dread of the still crueller days of winter.
"[Footnote 77: Herbert Wright, who finds that in children night-terrors"
"are apt to be associated with somnambulism, points out that when the"
somnambulism replaces the night-terrors it leaves no memory behind
"(_British Medical Journal_, 19th August 1899, p. 465). An interesting"
study of movement in normal and morbid sleep has been contributed by
"Segre ('Contributo alla Conoscenza dei Movimenti del Sonno,' _Archivio di"

"[Footnote 78: This question is, for instance, asked by F. H. Bradley ('On"
"the Failure of Movement in Dreams,' _Mind_, 1894, p. 373). The explanation"
he prefers is that the dream vision is out of relation to the very dimly
"conscious actual position of the body, so that the information necessary"
to complete the idea of the movement is wanting. Only as regards the less
"complicated movements of lips, tongue, or finger, when the motor idea is"
"in harmony with the actual position of the body movements, does movement"
take place. We have no means of distinguishing the real world from the
world of our vision; 'our images thus move naturally to realise themselves
in the world of our real limbs. But the world and its arrangement is for
"the moment out of connection with our ideas, and hence the attempt at"
motion for the most part must fail.' It is quite true that this conflict
"is an important factor in dreaming, but it fails to apply to the large"
number of movements which we dream of actually doing.]
[Footnote 79: The action of some drugs produces a state in this respect
resembling that which prevails in dreams. 'Under the influence of a large
"dose of haschisch,' Professor Stout remarks (_Analytic Psychology_, vol."
"i. p. 14), 'I found myself totally unable to distinguish between what"
"I actually did and saw, and what I merely thought about.' Not only are"
"the motor and sensory activities relatively dormant, but the central"
"activity is perfectly able, and content, to dispense with their services."

captain--the fellow who had apparently followed Tommy and Monsieur. He
"was a well-built blond, with a bullet-shaped head, high cheek bones and"
"deep set eyes--pig eyes. His right cheek bore several scars which,"
"considering his type, strongly suggested a German of University dueling"
"experiences. So I looked on him with a livelier suspicion, even as she"
seemed to be doing.
In an undertone he now said something that brought the old man to his
"feet. With fear written on their faces they talked for several minutes,"
during which the blond jerked his head once or twice toward the gambling
rooms. The girl had leaned forward watching them intently. Then with a
peremptory order the old one sent him away and sank back into his chair;
"but a moment later, clutching the tablecloth, he spoke a few words that"
made her recoil in evident horror.
"I did not know what to do or what to think, so I merely watched with"
"every sense alert. I saw him call the waiter for his settlement, I saw"
him take out a large roll of money and with trembling fingers peel off
the outside bill--a new and crinkly fifty-dollar note. I saw the girl
"idly marking on the winecard with a small gold pencil, though her eyes"
were veiling an intense excitement; and when the waiter returned with a
"pile of change which the old man began to count, I saw her furtively"
slip the winecard to her lap. A moment later it fell to the floor as she
arose to leave.
"Together they started toward the exit, but having taken a few steps she"
"left him with a brief word and returned, presumably for her glove."
"Partially free from his eternal vigilance, she raised her eyes without"
"dissimulation and looked quickly, appealingly into mine; then down at"
"her hand, on which she leaned, whose fingers were unfolding from a"
little ball of paper. Again into my eyes she looked--a look of infinite
appeal.
"that fate which should transform it into a chaos of rotting remains,"
and finally into dust.
"The gates were open, one half of them displaced and lying on the ground"
"at the entrance, while between its bars had grown the grass, which also"
covered the large and empty court-yard.  In the depths of this yard
"stood a low, iron-roofed, smoke-begrimed building.  The house itself"
"was of course unoccupied, but this shed, formerly a blacksmith's forge,"
"was now turned into a ""dosshouse,"" kept by a retired Captain named"
Aristid Fomich Kuvalda.
"In the interior of the dosshouse was a long, wide and grimy board,"
measuring some 28 by 70 feet.  The room was lighted on one side by four
"small square windows, and on the other by a wide door.  The unpainted"
"brick walls were black with smoke, and the ceiling, which was built of"
"timber, was almost black.  In the middle stood a large stove, the"
"furnace of which served as its foundation, and around this stove and"
"along the walls were also long, wide boards, which served as beds for"
"the lodgers.  The walls smelt of smoke, the earthen floor of dampness,"
and the long wide board of rotting rags.
"The place of the proprietor was on the top of the stove, while the"
boards surrounding it were intended for those who were on good terms
with the owner and who were honoured by his friendship.  During the day
"the captain passed most of his time sitting on a kind of bench, made by"
"himself by placing bricks against the wall of the courtyard, or else in"
"the eating house of Egor Vavilovitch, which was opposite the house,"
where he took all his meals and where he also drank vodki.
"Before renting this house, Aristid Kuvalda had kept a registry office"
for servants in the town.  If we look further back into his former
"life, we shall find that he once owned printing works, and previous to"
"the pearl was afterward sold in Paris for $12,000 it is quite evident"
"that the share of the middleman, of whom political economists just now"
"talk so much, was heavy. The Panama pearls are sometimes of beautiful"
"colors, green, pale blue and a delicate pink. On the Chiriqui coast a"
"year or two ago a pearl weighing about forty-two carats, about the size"
"and shape of a partridge egg, greenish black at the base and shading to"
"a steel gray at the tip, was found. It was sold in Paris for $5000."

It is a curious fact that the use of mussels from our western rivers is
one cause for the decadence of the Panama pearl industry. For years the
actual expense of maintaining these fisheries was met by the sale of the
shell for use in making buttons and mother-of-pearl ornaments. The
"pearls represented the profit of the enterprise, which was always"
therefore more or less of a gamble--but a game in which it was
"impossible to lose, though the winnings might be great or small"
according to luck. Now that the demand for pearl oyster shells has
"fallen off, owing to the competition of mussels, the chances in the game"
are rather against the player and the sport languishes.
[Illustration: THE GOVERNMENT SCHOOL OF HAT MAKING]
[Illustration: BEGINNING A PANAMA HAT]
The authorities of the Republic are making some effort to establish a
system of industrial schools which may lead to the fuller utilization of
the natural resources of the country. Every tourist who visits the
Isthmus is immediately taught by one who has been there a day or two
longer than he that Panama hats are not made in Panama. This seems to
be the most precious information that anyone on the Zone has to impart.
Most of the hats there sold are indeed made in Ecuador and the name
"Everywhere the smooth dark trunks converged upon one another, sending"
up a tangle of boughs that glittered in the soft sheen of the
"sunlight. Withered bracken stood in thin silence, and here and there a"
dead bough lay like a snake with its head raised to strike.
"The silence was immense, and yet it was a stillness that suggested"
"sounds. It resembled the silence of a huge cavern, out of which came"
strange whisperings; innumerable crepitations seemed to come from the
"dead leaves. Francesco fancied he could hear the trees breathing, and"
from afar he caught the wild note of a bird.
The sun was low when they came at last to the edge of the forest and
saw a hill rise steeply against the sky. It was covered with silver
"birches, whose stems looked like white threads in the level light of"
the setting sun. And rising against the sky-line from amidst the
fretwork of birch-boughs Francesco saw the well-remembered outlines of
the ruined tower wherein he had spent a memorable night.
"The valley before them was flooded with golden light, and, as they"
"crossed it, Francesco felt a curious desire for physical pain,"
"something fierce and tangible to struggle with, to drown the"
ever-pulsing memory of the woman who had gone from him.
As the dusk deepened they went scrambling up the hillside amid the
"birches, whose white stems glimmered upwards into the blue gloom of"
"the twilight. Francesco's thoughts climbed ahead of him, hurrying to"
deal with the unknown dangers that might be awaiting him. He had to
"dismount, pull his steed after him; but the scramble upwards gave him"
the sense of effort and struggle that he needed. It was like scaling a
"wall to come to grips with an enemy, whose wild eyes and sword-points"
showed between the crenelations.

"Risca looked round the dainty room, his whenever he chose to occupy it,"
"and knew how much, especially of late, it held of Stellamaris. It had"
"been redecorated a short while before, and the colours and the patterns"
and all had been her choice and specification.
"The castle architect, a young and fervent soul called Wratislaw, a"
"member of the Art Workers' Guild, and a friend of Herold's, who had"
"settled in Southcliff-on-Sea, and was building, for the sake of a"
"precarious livelihood, hideous bungalows which made his own heart sick,"
"but his clients' hearts rejoice, had been called in to advise. With"
"Stellamaris, sovereign lady of the house, aged fifteen, he had spent"
hours of stupefied and aesthetic delight. He had brought her armfuls of
"designs, cartloads of illustrated books; and the result of it all was"
"that, with certain other redecorations in the house with which for"
"the moment we have no concern, Risca's room was transformed from"
late-Victorian solidity into early-Georgian elegance. The Adam Brothers
"reigned in ceiling and cornice, and the authentic spirit of Sheraton,"
"thanks to the infatuated enterprise of Wratislaw, pervaded the"
"furniture. Yet, despite Wratislaw, although through him she had spoken,"
the presence of Stellamaris pervaded the room. On the writing-table lay
"a leather-covered blotter, with his initials, J. R., stamped in gold. In"
"desperate answer to a childish question long ago, he had described the"
bedspread on his Parian marble bed in the palace as a thing of rosebuds
and crinkly ribbons tied up in true-lovers' knots. On his bed in
Stella's house lay a spread exquisitely Louis XV in design.
"Risca looked about the room. Yes, everything was Stella. And behold"
Luther was a born music lover and a musician of adequate training.
Moreover he possessed a remarkable gift for writing hymns in clear
thought to bring the Word of God home to the hearts of the common
people. He and his followers put songs on the lips of the German people
and they sang themselves into the Reformation. So effective were these
songs that his enemies in the Roman church declared that “Luther’s songs
have damned more souls than all his books and speeches.”
_Chorales._ The word “chorale” (“choral” in German) refers to the hymn
"tunes of Lutheran Protestantism, though in common usage the term"
includes the words associated with the tunes. The melodies had much to
do with the popularity of the songs. They came from various sources.
Many of them were original compositions by Luther and others; some were
borrowed from the hymn books of the Bohemian Brethren; a considerable
number were adaptations of plainsongs used in the Catholic Church; still
others were adopted from beloved folksongs. Luther was an eclectic in
his choice of music. He used any tune from any source that suited his
purpose. Many thousands of chorales came into existence in Germany
during his time and the two centuries that followed. The hundreds still
in use represent the best in church music today. They are characterized
"by a plain melody, a strong harmony, and a stately rhythm; all of which"
adapts them well for effective congregational singing.
The chorales at first did not have the regular rhythms that they later
"took on. The steady progression of even notes, invariable in Bach’s day,"
"had come only gradually into use. Some of the recent hymnbooks, in the"
"interest of greater variety of rhythm, are returning to the original"
“rhythmic chorales.”
Though _unison_ singing has been widely practiced and is advocated today
"by some good authorities in church music, Luther encouraged part"

Another Panamanian product which the tourists buy eagerly but which is
rapidly becoming rare is the pearl. In the Gulf of Panama are a group of
islands which have been known as Las Islas des Perlas--the Pearl
"Islands. This archipelago is about thirty miles long, with sixteen big"
"islands and a quantity of small ones, and lies about sixty miles south"
of Panama City. Balboa saw them from the shore and intended to visit
them but never did. Pizarro stopped there on his way to Peru and
plundered them to his heart’s content. Otherwise their history has been
uneventful. Saboga on the island of the same name is a beautiful little
"tropical village of about 300 huts, on a high bluff bordering a bay"
that affords excellent anchorage. Whales are plentiful in these waters
"and Pacific whalers are often seen in port. San Miguel, the largest town"
"of the archipelago, is on Rey Island and has about 1000 inhabitants. The"
"tower of its old church is thickly inlaid with glistening, pearly shell."
[Illustration: DESPOILING OLD GUAYMI GRAVES]
"The pearl fisheries have been overworked for years, perhaps centuries,"
and begin to show signs of being exhausted. Nevertheless the tourist who
takes the trip to the islands from the City of Panama will find himself
beset by children as he lands offering seed pearls in quantities.
Occasionally real bargains may be had from “beach combers” not only at
"Rey Island, but even at Taboga, where I knew an American visitor to pick"
up for eleven dollars three pearls valued at ten or twelve times as much
when shown in the United States. There are stories of lucky finds among
divers that vie with the tales of nuggets among gold prospectors. Once a
native boy diving for sport in one of the channels near Naos Island
brought up an oyster in which was a black pearl that was sold in Panama
"for $3000. The report does not say how much of this the boy got, but as"
track of foreign bodies carried in with the projectile. See case 160.
Fig. 84 illustrates an example where the limitation to the abdominal
wall was evident on inspection. Here the division of the thick muscles
of the abdominal wall had led to the formation of a swelling exactly
"similar to that seen after the subcutaneous rupture of a muscle, and two"
soft fluctuating tumours bounded by contracted muscle existed in the
substance of the oblique and rectus muscles.
[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Wound of Abdominal Wall (Lee-Metford). Division
of fibres of external oblique and rectus abdominis muscles. Case 159]
The cases which presented the most serious diagnostic difficulty in this
relation were those in which the wound was situated in the thicker
muscular portions of the lower part of the abdominal and pelvic walls.
"Such a case is illustrated in the chapter on fractures (see fig. 55, p."
"191). I saw one or two such instances, in which only the exploration"
necessary for treatment of the fracture decided the point. In many of
the wounds affecting the lateral portion of the abdominal wall the
"question of penetration could never be definitely cleared up, as wounds"
of the colon sometimes gave rise to absolutely no symptoms.
In a certain proportion of the injuries the peritoneal cavity was no
"doubt perforated without the infliction of any further visceral injury,"
and in these also the doubt as to the occurrence of penetration was
never solved.
(158) _Wound of belly wall._--Wounded at Modder River. _Entry_
"(Mauser), 2 inches below the centre of the left iliac crest;"
"_exit_, 1-1/2 inch above and internal to the left anterior"
superior iliac spine. The patient was on horseback at the time
"of the injury and did not fall; he got down, however, and lay"
which proceeding I speak of later in detail. (See Chapter on Questions.)
We now come to the question as to what proportion of _Dramatic
Excitement_ we should present in the stories for a normal group of
"children. Personally, I should like, while the child is very young"
"(I mean in mind, not in years) to exclude the element of dramatic"
"excitement, but though this may be possible for the individual child,"
it is quite Utopian to hope we can keep the average child free from
"what is in the atmosphere. Children crave for excitement, and unless we"
"give it to them in legitimate form, they will take it in any riotous"
"form it presents itself, and if from our experience we can control"
"their mental digestion by a moderate supply of what they demand, we"
may save them from devouring too eagerly the raw material they can so
easily find for themselves.
There is a humorous passage bearing on this question in the story of
"the small Scotch boy, when he asks leave of his parents to present the"
pious little book--a gift to himself from his Aunt--to a little sick
"friend, hoping probably that the friend's chastened condition will make"
him more lenient towards this mawkish form of literature. The parents
"expostulate, pointing out to their son how ungrateful he is, and how"
ungracious it would be to part with his Aunt's gift. Then the boy can
"contain himself no longer. He bursts out, unconsciously expressing the"
normal attitude of children at a certain stage of development: “It's
a _daft_ book ony way; there's naebody gets kilt en't. I like stories
"about folk getting their heids cut off, or stabbit through and through,"
wi' swords an' spears. An' there's nae wile beasts. I like Stories
"about black men gettin' ate up, an' white men killin' lions and tigers"
an' bears an'----”
"Then, again, we have the passage from George Eliot's “Mill on the"
Floss”:
in the course of a few days he became a raving lunatic.
"Often the keepers, although only condemned to imprisonment for a"
"certain period at a time, have to tolerate a longer stay, owing to"
the relief-boat being unable to approach them. In some instances the
delay may run into five weeks or more. During the winter the relief of
"the Eddystone, Longships, Wolf, Fastnet, Skerryvore, and Dhu-Heartach"
lights is always a matter of extreme uncertainty. Although the men
"have to provide themselves with supplies, a reserve is maintained at"
the station by the authorities for such emergencies. Even some of the
land stations are not approachable readily. There is the Punta Gorda
"light-station on the Californian coast, the situation of which is wild"
"and forbidding. There is a landing about eight miles above the station,"
"but it is extremely precarious. Still, unless a certain element of risk"
"is accepted in coming ashore here, it is necessary to face a tramp or"
stage journey of nearly fifty miles across country in order to gain the
lighthouse.
"The lighthouses in the Red Sea are, perhaps, among the most unenviable"
"and trying in the world. This stretch of water, lying between two"
"blistered coasts of sand, is no more or less than an oven, where even"
the strongest constitution finds it difficult to hold out for long.
"Moreover, the absence of civilization, owing to the extreme aridity of"
"the country, renders the life exceptionally depressing. In the summer"
the heat is wellnigh intolerable. The thermometer hovers between 95°
"and 110° F. in the shade throughout the twenty-four hours, so that"
night brings no relief to the oppressiveness.
"At some of the stations the men seek a little diversion, and"
"incidentally add occasionally to their pocket-money, by shark-catching,"
"which is a tolerably profitable pursuit, since these waters are thickly"
infested with this fish. The jawbone and backbone invariably find ready
hospitals and also among the brave wives of the soldiers so
fascinating that from the New Year till early June I let all social
"duties slip, so much so that I had a nervous breakdown in June, and"
since then have had to go very slow.
We had a splendid time at our seaside cottage at Negishi this
"afternoon, any amount of our dear brown soldiers round us. There"
are five hundred quartered in that fishing village just now; they
"were resting, bathing, boating, washing their clothes or cooking"
"their chow, but never a rude word or an uncouth action; no"
"rowdyism, but all as civil, quiet, good-tempered, and alert as"
possible; they are a marvel; and my children go in and out among
"them and love them, like I do! I could _kill_ white idiots when I"
hear them speak of those fine fellows as 'an inferior race.' Ye
"gods! 'inferior' with never a camp follower to their name, and"
rapine unknown even after the fiercest fight! What European race
can show a record like that? I wish I could be home for six months
and tell what the soldiers and their wives are--what miracles of
cheerful patience and manly dignity the wounded men are as they lie
"hacked and maimed, sometimes till almost all semblance of manhood"
"is gone, yet never a murmur does any one hear from their lips--no,"
"not if they are armless, legless, and even _blind_. And you would"
not dare condole with them! They say and believe they 'are greatly
"honoured.' When they embrace Christianity, they shame the brightest"
"Christian among us, and I come away from visiting the hospitals"
"feeling so small, so humble, yet at peace with all the world. We"
"have very, very much to learn from this great people."
"This second extract, about a soldier's wife, may come home to your"
readers even more:--
I allow two families a small sum of money every week. One case is
Englishmen before Marlowe flung his flaming torch amongst them. To
"understand the story a slight introduction is necessary. Igerna, the"
"wife of Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall, was loved by King Uther, who foully"
slew her husband and so won her for himself. As a result of this union
"were born Arthur and Anne, who, in their youth, perpetuated the"
"inherited taint of sin by becoming the parents of a boy, Mordred."
"Afterwards Arthur married Guenevera, and some years later went to France"
on a long campaign of conquest. In his absence Mordred gained the love
"of Guenevera. The play begins with the contemplated return of Arthur,"
"glorious from victory, the object being to concentrate attention upon"
"the swift fall from glory and power to ruin and death. Guenevera, having"
"learnt to hate her husband, debates in her mind his death or hers,"
"finally deciding, however, to become a nun. Her interview with Mordred"
ends in his resolving to resist Arthur's landing. Unsuccessful in this
"attempt, and defeated in battle, he spurns all thought of submission,"
"challenging his father to a second conflict, in Cornwall. Arthur,"
"feeling that his sins have found him out, would gladly make peace; but,"
"stung by Mordred's defiance, he follows him into Cornwall. There both"
"armies are destroyed and Mordred is slain, though in his death he"
mortally wounds his father. After the battle his body is brought before
"Arthur, in whom the sight awakens yet more fiercely the pangs of"
remorse. The play closes immediately before Arthur's own mysterious
departure.
Here is all the material for a great tragedy. The point for beginning
"the story is well chosen, though in obvious imitation of _Agamemnon_."
"Attention is concentrated on the catastrophe, no alien element being"
admitted to detract from the melancholy effect. It is sought to
"intensify the gloom by recourse to Seneca's stage Ghost; thus, the"
departed spirit of the wronged Gorlois opens the play with horrid
"imprecations of evil upon the house of Uther, and, at the close, exults"
"in the fullness of his revenge. From his mouth, as well as from the lips"
lemon peel on the cocktail of creation—such is the bride. Holy is the
wife; revered the mother; galliptious is the summer girl—but the bride
is the certified check among the wedding presents that the gods send in
when man is married to mortality.
The car glided up the Golden Way. On the bridge of the great cruiser
"the captain stood, trumpeting the sights of the big city to his"
"passengers. Wide-mouthed and open-eared, they heard the sights of the"
"metropolis thundered forth to their eyes. Confused, delirious with"
"excitement and provincial longings, they tried to make ocular responses"
to the megaphonic ritual. In the solemn spires of spreading cathedrals
they saw the home of the Vanderbilts; in the busy bulk of the Grand
"Central depot they viewed, wonderingly, the frugal cot of Russell Sage."
"Bidden to observe the highlands of the Hudson, they gaped,"
"unsuspecting, at the upturned mountains of a new-laid sewer. To many"
"the elevated railroad was the Rialto, on the stations of which"
uniformed men sat and made chop suey of your tickets. And to this day
"in the outlying districts many have it that Chuck Connors, with his"
"hand on his heart, leads reform; and that but for the noble municipal"
"efforts of one Parkhurst, a district attorney, the notorious “Bishop”"
Potter gang would have destroyed law and order from the Bowery to the
Harlem River.
But I beg you to observe Mrs. James Williams—Hattie Chalmers that
"was—once the belle of Cloverdale. Pale-blue is the bride’s, if she"
will; and this colour she had honoured. Willingly had the moss rosebud
loaned to her cheeks of its pink—and as for the violet!—her eyes will
"do very well as they are, thank you. A useless strip of white chaf—oh,"
"no, he was guiding the auto car—of white chiffon—or perhaps it was"
"grenadine or tulle—was tied beneath her chin, pretending to hold her"
bonnet in place. But you know as well as I do that the hatpins did the
work.
"could not make a Burman ill-use his pony if you tried, and I fancy that"
to break these little half-wild ponies to go in cabs in crowded streets
"requires severe treatment. At least, I never knew but one"
"hackney-carriage driver either in Rangoon or Mandalay who was a Burman,"
and he very soon gave it up. He said that the work was too heavy either
"for a pony or a man. I think, perhaps, it was for the safety of the"
"public that he resigned, for his ponies were the very reverse of"
meek--which a native of India says a hackney-carriage pony should
be--and he drove entirely by the light of Nature.
"So all the drivers of gharries, as we call them, are natives of India or"
"half-breeds, and it is amongst them that the work of the Society for the"
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals principally lies. While I was in
"Rangoon I tried a number of cases of over-driving, of using ponies with"
"sore withers and the like. I never tried a Burman. Even in Rangoon,"
"which has become almost Indianized, his natural humanity never left the"
"Burman. As far as Burmans are concerned, the Society for the Prevention"
of Cruelty to Animals need not exist. They are kinder to their animals
than even the members of the Society could be. Instances occur every
day; here is one of the most striking that I remember.
"There is a town in Burma where there are some troops stationed, and"
which is the headquarters of the civil administration of the district.
"It is, or was then, some distance from a railway-station, and it was"
necessary to make some arrangement for the carriage of the mails to and
"from the town and station. The Post-Office called for tenders, and at"
length it was arranged through the civil authorities that a coach should
run once a day each way to carry the mails and passengers. A native of
India agreed to take the contract--for Burmans seldom or never care to
take them--and he was to comply with certain conditions and receive a
certain subsidy.
"before undertaking it, and to calculate the probable benefit it could"
"get therefrom, and the probable expenses it would incur; not to speak of"
the result of any possible failure. It may be presumed that Japan would
not tamely be intimidated by any action undertaken by any country which
"is not based on justice and equity, and which, therefore, is not open to"
reason.
"Further, is there any country which would willingly embark on such an"
enterprise single-handed? I think not. The reason is too obvious for me
to elucidate.
"Putting aside altogether any question of justice and equity, if such an"
"enterprise is to be embarked upon at all, it would have to be by common"
"action of all the Western Powers, somewhat similar to that when the"
combined forces of Europe rose against France some hundred years ago.
But let me ask if such a thing is possible under the present
circumstances? The claims of Japan to the kind consideration of humanity
have already become so widely spread that she could no longer be
"trampled upon easily. Man is, after all, a rational being. Do the"
writers of the articles on the Yellow Peril (articles which even now
repeatedly make their appearance) not know the fact that even in France
there is a large number of people who have recently purchased Japanese
"bonds, not to speak of Germany, where those bonds have been openly"
floated by banks of high standing? Even if all the governments of the
"West should be willing to agree to such an enterprise, I do not think"
the people at large would move with them.
"Japan is modest enough, Japan is honest enough. Why does she deserve a"
"general ostracism? She might become, it is possible, a Power of the"
"world. She might become, it is possible, more civilised on the lines of"
"occidental civilisation, after which she strives so earnestly. Are these"
"examined it, but there was no writing upon it.  Apparently it was her"
"reserve store of paper, to be used as wanted.  In the French Ministry of"
"Foreign Affairs everything is methodical, especially the preparation of"
"the dossiers.  A certain dossier had once fallen into Kaye's hands, and"
it contained sheets of exactly similar paper to that which I held in my
hand.
"Eagerly I continued my search, striving to discover some writing which"
"might lead me to a knowledge of the truth, but I found nothing.  I had"
"completed an examination of the whole of the contents of the drawers,"
when it occurred to me that there might be some other drawer concealed
there.  Years ago I had been offered an escritoire of this pattern in
"Genoa, and the sun-tanned fellow who endeavoured to induce me to"
purchase it had shown behind the centre drawer in the table a cunningly
contrived cavity where private correspondence might be concealed.
"Therefore I drew out the drawer, sounded the interior at the back, and,"
"finding it hollow, searched about for the spring by which it might be"
"opened.  At last I found it, and next moment drew forth a bundle of"
letters.  They were bound with a blue ribbon that time had faded.  I
"glanced at the superscription of the uppermost, and a thrill of sympathy"
went through me.
Those carefully preserved letters were my own--letters full of love and
"tenderness, which I had written in the days that were dead.  I stood"
"holding them in my hand, my heart full of the past."
"In this narrative, my reader, it is my intention to conceal nothing, but"
"to relate to you the whole, undisguised truth, even though this chapter"
of England's secret history presents a seemingly improbable combination
of strange facts and circumstances.  Therefore I will not hide from you
"the truth that in those moments, as I drew forth one of the letters I"
moderate. Meanwhile the smouldering quarrel with Lee assumed ever more
hateful forms. In vain did Erasmus's English friends attempt to restrain
"their young, ambitious compatriot. Erasmus on his part irritated him"
furtively. He reveals in this whole dispute a lack of self-control and
dignity which shows his weakest side. Usually so anxious as to decorum
"he now lapses into invectives: The British adder, Satan, even the old"
taunt ascribing a tail to Englishmen has to serve once more. The points
at issue disappear altogether behind the bitter mutual reproaches. In
"his unrestrained anger, Erasmus avails himself of the most unworthy"
weapons. He eggs his German friends on to write against Lee and to
"ridicule him in all his folly and brag, and then he assures all his"
English friends: 'All Germany is literally furious with Lee; I have the
greatest trouble in keeping them back'.
Alack! Germany had other causes of disturbance: it is 1520 and the three
great polemics of Luther were setting the world on fire.
Though one may excuse the violence and the petty spitefulness of Erasmus
"in this matter, as resulting from an over-sensitive heart falling"
"somewhat short in really manly qualities, yet it is difficult to deny"
that he failed completely to understand both the arguments of his
adversaries and the great movements of his time.
It was very easy for Erasmus to mock the narrow-mindedness of
conservative divines who thought that there would be an end to faith in
Holy Scripture as soon as the emendation of the text was attempted.
"'""They correct the Holy Gospel, nay, the Pater Noster itself!"" the"
preacher exclaims indignantly in the sermon before his surprised
"congregation. As if I cavilled at Matthew and Luke, and not at those"
"who, out of ignorance and carelessness, have corrupted them. What do"
people wish? That the Church should possess Holy Scripture as correct as
"possible, or not?' This reasoning seemed to Erasmus, with his passionate"
"Tall and angular, he kept his head in such a position that his chin"
"touched his breast.  He was the Captain's first lodger, and it was said"
"of him that he had a great deal of money hidden somewhere, and for its"
sake had nearly had his throat cut some two years ago: ever since then
"he carried his head thus. Over his eyes hung greyish eyebrows, and,"
"looked at in profile, only his crooked nose was to be seen.  His shadow"
"reminded one of a poker.  He denied that he had money, and said that"
"they ""only tried to cut his throat out of malice,"" and from that day he"
"took to collecting rags, and that is why his head was always bent as if"
incessantly looking on the ground.  When he went about shaking his
"head, and minus a walking-stick in his hand, and a bag on his back--the"
"signs of his profession--he seemed to be thinking almost to madness,"
"and, at such times, Kuvalda spoke thus, pointing to him with his finger:"
"""Look, there is the conscience of Merchant Judas Petunikoff.  See how"
"disorderly, dirty, and low is the escaped conscience."""
"Tyapa, as a rule, spoke in a hoarse and hardly audible voice, and that"
"is why he spoke very little, and loved to be alone.  But whenever a"
"stranger, compelled to leave the village, appeared in the dosshouse,"
"Tyapa seemed sadder and angrier, and followed the unfortunate about"
with biting jeers and a wicked chuckling in his throat. He either put
"some beggar against him, or himself threatened to rob and beat him,"
till the frightened mujik would disappear from the dosshouse and never
"more be seen.  Then Tyapa was quiet again, and would sit in some corner"
"mending his rags, or else reading his Bible, which was as dirty, worn,"
and old as himself.  Only when the teacher brought a newspaper and
"began reading did he come from his corner once more.  As a rule, Tyapa"
"listened to what was read silently and sighed often, without asking"
"anything of anyone.  But once when the teacher, having read the paper,"
"wanted to put it away, Tyapa stretched out his bony hand, and said,"
"""Give it to me ..."""
their kids.
"Then, as if in a very vexing dream, she could almost but never quite"
"see, through the thickening mist of the years, once-familiar"
"faces--white men, with swords, in ragged uniforms, and big brown ones"
"with wicked eyes and long, thin guns, glaring down at her over a high"
"wall, through smoke and fire, and fighting, and the acrid reek of"
powder....
"And there remembrance grew blank altogether, until it connected with"
"Captain Dove, on the deck of a slaving-dhow far out of sight of any"
land. She had been only a little child when he had carried her up the
"side of his own ship in his arms, while she laughed gleefully in his"
"face and pulled at his shaggy moustache, but she could still remember"
some of the incidents of that day.
"She had lived on board his successive ships ever since. And ever since,"
"until recently, he had always been very good to her, in his own queer,"
gruff way. He had always treated her as though she were a child of his
"own, shielding her, in so far as he could, from even the knowledge of"
all the evil which he had done up and down the world. She had grown up
in the belief that his despotic guardianship was altogether for her good
and not to be disputed.
"But now--she was no longer a child. And all her old, unquestioning faith"
"in his inherent good intentions, toward her at least, was finally"
shattered. She knew now that he really looked upon her as a mere
"chattel, with a cash value--just as if she had been one of the hapless"
cargo of human cattle confined in the pestiferous hold of the dhow on
whose deck he had found her at play. She knew now that he had bought and
"paid for them as well as her, and sold them again at a fat profit, far"
"across the seas--all but the dumb, deformed black woman whom he had"
"monthly, which arose fairly directly out of erudite correspondence. It"
"was, as in antiquity--which in this respect was imitated better and more"
"profitably, perhaps, than in any other sphere--an art. Even before 1500"
"Erasmus had, at Paris, described that art in the treatise, _De"
"conscribendis epistolis_, which was to appear in print in 1522. People"
"wrote, as a rule, with a view to later publication, for a wider circle,"
"or at any rate, with the certainty that the recipient would show the"
"letter to others. A fine Latin letter was a gem, which a man envied his"
neighbour. Erasmus writes to Budaeus: 'Tunstall has devoured your letter
to me and re-read it as many as three or four times; I had literally to
tear it from his hands.'
Unfortunately fate did not always take into consideration the author's
"intentions as to publicity, semi-publicity or strict secrecy. Often"
"letters passed through many hands before reaching their destination, as"
did Servatius's letter to Erasmus in 1514. 'Do be careful about
"letters,' he writes more than once; 'waylayers are on the lookout to"
"intercept them.' Yet, with the curious precipitation that characterizes"
"him, Erasmus was often very careless as to what he wrote. From an early"
"age he preserved and cared for his letters, yet nevertheless, through"
"his itinerant life, many were lost. He could not control their"
publication. As early as 1509 a friend sent him a manuscript volume of
"his own (Erasmus's) letters, that he had picked up for sale at Rome."
Erasmus had it burnt at once. Since 1515 he himself superintended the
publication of his letters; at first only a few important ones;
"afterwards in 1516 a selection of letters from friends to him, and after"
"that ever larger collections till, at the end of his life, there"
appeared a new collection almost every year. No article was so much in
"demand on the book market as letters by Erasmus, and no wonder. They"
"were models of excellent style, tasteful Latin, witty expression and"
elegant erudition.
"anchor and then hoists it up, one recoils from the black and slimy mud"
"those blue waves hide; and this circumstance, slight as it may seem,"
held a potent influence on our future.
"Riding nearby was another yacht, in size and design very much like the"
"_Whim_, except that her rigging had an old-fashioned cut. Her masts were"
"checked with age and, where our craft showed polished brass, she long"
"ago had resorted to white paint. At the same time, she gave the"
"impression of aristocracy--broken-down aristocracy, if you choose. No"
"bunting fluttered at her masthead, no country's emblem waved over her"
"taffrail, and the only hint of nationality or ownership was a rather"
"badly painted word _Orchid_ on her name plate. Taken altogether, she was"
rather difficult to place.
"These signs of poverty would have passed unobserved by us, had we not in"
coming to anchor swung between her moorings and the Machina wharf. Not
"that it made any serious difference, Gates explained, nor were we"
"impertinently near, but it just missed being the scrupulously polite"
thing to have done--and Gates was a stickler on matters of yacht
"etiquette. So he felt uncomfortable about it, while at the same time"
being reluctant to hoist anchor and foul our decks with the bottom of
Havana Bay. To be on the safe side he determined to megaphone apologies
"and consult her wishes. Twice he hailed, receiving no answer. Two"
sailors were seated forward playing cards--a surlier pair of ruffians
would have been hard to find--but neither of them so much as glanced up.
"""Let the professor try in Spanish,"" Tommy said."
"Monsieur took the megaphone and did so, but with no better success. Then"
to our profound admiration he called in half a dozen languages; finally
"growling: ""Lascars, likely!""--and proceeded to hail in something he"
afterwards explained was Lascar gibberish. All of which failed to
fish or looking for iguanas and crabs hidden in the holes of the banks.
"“Physically the Chocoes are a fine and healthy race. They are tall, as"
"compared with the Cuna-Cuna, well proportioned, and with a graceful"
bearing. The men have wiry limbs and faces that are at once kind and
"energetic, while as a rule the girls are plump, fat, and full of"
mischief. The grown women preserve their good looks and attractiveness
"much longer than is generally the case in primitive peoples, in which"
their sex bears the heaviest share of every day’s work.
"“Both males and females have unusually fine white teeth, which they"
sometimes dye black by chewing the shoots of one of the numerous wild
peppers growing in the forests. The skin is of a rich olive-brown color
"and, as usual, a little lighter in women and children. Though all go"
"almost naked, they look fairer than the San Blas Cunas, and some of the"
women would compare advantageously in this respect with certain
Mediterranean types of the white race.
"“The hair is left by all to grow to its natural length, except in a few"
"cases, in which the men have it cropped at the neck. It is coarse and"
"not jet black, as reported of most Indians, but with a reddish hue,"
which is better noticed when the sun is playing through the thick mass.
"“In young children it decidedly turns at times to a blond color, the"
only difference from the Caucasian hair being the pronounced coarseness
of the former. As there are no white people living within a radius of
"fifty miles, but only negroes, mulattoes and zambos, this peculiarity"
"cannot be explained by miscegenation, and may therefore be considered as"
a racial feature of the Choco tribe.
"“In men the every-day dress consists of a scanty clout, made of a strip"
of red calico about one foot broad and five feet long. This clout is
I shall not say whence the document emanated. I believe it was composed
"by some one who does not lack a certain knowledge of Japan, but who has"
drawn false deductions from his knowledge of similar matters of other
countries. Here is the best example. The document speaks of the native
contingents of Formosa. Now there exist no such forces in Formosa. The
"garrisons of Formosa are sent there from Japan. On the other hand, in"
the colonies belonging to other countries there are generally troops
formed of native contingents. It is notably so in French colonies. The
"author of the document in question, reasoning from these facts, thought"
that it ought to be the same with Formosa.
Has Japan any fear of another alteration of the Treaty of
Shimonoseki being imposed upon her?
"The combined action of Russia, Germany and France, for imposing on"
Japan an alteration of the Treaty of Shimonoseki appears to us to have
been a great error on their parts. I can positively say that there are
many eminent persons in Germany and in France who regret that action.
"Even in Russia, in certain quarters, a belief seems to be entertained"
"that, but for the fault then committed, the present misfortunes would"
"not have happened. As to ourselves, we are not hypnotised by the errors"
then committed by those three powers. We intend to remain friends of
"France, of Germany, and even of Russia, in spite of the injustice we"
"have suffered, provided, of course, those powers wish to keep"
friendship.
We do not overlook the possibility of another combination which those
"powers may have an idea of forming against us, and it behoves us to be"
"watchful. Nevertheless, to tell you my candid opinion, it is scarcely"
possible that a similar intervention should be renewed. I do not think
France would push her docility so far as to follow Germany a second
"time. It would be necessary that Germany should set the example, aided"
necessary. In this matter the aims of the people and the Government are
one. In facing a common danger and in co-operation there must arise
mutual respect and understanding. And perhaps through the very
catastrophe that is threatening the world there may grow up in India a
realisation of community of interest and solidarity as between
Government and people.
A CALL FOR NOBLER PATRIOTISM
A very serious danger is thus seen to be threatening the future of
"India, and to avert it will require the utmost effort of the people."
They have not only to meet the economic crisis but also to protect the
ideals of ancient Aryan civilisation from the destructive forces that
are threatening it. Nothing great can be conserved except through
"constant effort and sacrifice. There is a danger of, regarding the"
mechanical efficiency as the sole end of life; there is also the
"opposite danger of a life of dreaming, bereft of struggle and activity,"
degenerating into parasitic habits of dependence. Only through the
nobler call of patriotism can our nation realise her highest ideals in
thought and in action; to that call the nation will always respond. He
had the inestimable privilege of winning the intimate friendship of Mr.
"G. K. Gokhale. Before leaving England, our foremost Indian statesman"
"whose loss we so deeply mourn, had come to stay with the speaker for a"
few days at Eastbourne. He knew that this was to be their last meeting.
Almost his parting question to Dr. Bose was whether science had anything
"to say about future incarnations. For himself, however he was certain"
that as soon as he would cast off his worn out frame he was to be born
"once more in the country he loved, and bear all the country that may be"
laid on him in her service. There can be no doubt that there must be
salvation for a country which can count on sons as devoted as Gopal
Krishna Gokhale.
"red croton leaves, and the leaves of the red-blossomed mangrove--red"
"coloured substances being used to make the shell red, magically. Then,"
"passing in front of all the other canoes, he rubs their prows with"
"the bundle of leaves. After that, the canoes at both ends of the"
"row begin to punt along, the row evolving into a circle, through"
"which presently the canoe of the magician passes, punting along its"
"diameter. At this place in the Lagoon, there is a small vatu (coral"
outcrop) called Vitukwayla'i. This is called the vatu of the baloma
"(spirits). At this vatu the magician's canoe stops, and he orders some"
of its crew to dive down and here to begin the gathering of shells.
Some more private magic is performed later on by each canoe on its own
"account. The anchor stone is charmed with some red hibiscus flowers,"
in order to make the spondylus shell red. There is another private
"magic called 'sweeping of the sea,' which, like the magic of the mussel"
"shell, mentioned above, makes the sea clear and transparent. Finally,"
there is an evil magic called 'besprinkling with salt water.' If a
"man does it over the others, he will annul the effects of their magic,"
"and frustrate their efforts, while he himself would arouse astonishment"
and suspicion by the amount of shell collected. Such a man would dive
"down into the water, take some brine into his mouth, and emerging,"
"spray it towards the other canoes, while he utters the evil charm."
So much for the magic and the ceremonial associated with the
"spondylus fishing in the Trobriand Lagoon. In Sanaroa, exactly the"
"same proceedings take place, except that there is no attracting of"
"the reef, probably because they are already at the original seat"
of the kaloma. Again I was told that some of the private magic
would be performed in Sinaketa before the fleet sailed on the Kula
"expedition. The objects medicated would be then kept, well wrapped"
in dried leaves.
"1. Each series of the stratified rocks, except the very deepest,"
contains vestiges of life. Hence THE EARTH WAS TENANTED BY LIVING
CREATURES FOR AN UNCALCULATED LENGTH OF TIME BEFORE HUMAN HISTORY
BEGAN.
2. LIFE ON THE EARTH HAS BEEN EVERCHANGING. The youngest strata
hold the remains of existing species of animals and plants and
those of species and varieties closely allied to them. Strata
"somewhat older contain fewer existing species, and in strata of a"
"still earlier, but by no means an ancient epoch, no existing"
species are to be found; the species of that epoch and of previous
epochs have vanished from the living world. During all geological
time since life began on earth old species have constantly become
extinct and with them the genera and families to which they
"belong, and other species, genera, and families have replaced"
them. The fossils of each formation differ on the whole from those
of every other. The assemblage of animals and plants (the FAUNA-
FLORA) of each epoch differs from that of every other epoch.
In many cases the extinction of a type has been gradual; in other
instances apparently abrupt. There is no evidence that any
organism once become extinct has ever reappeared. The duration of
"a species in time, or its ""vertical range"" through the strata,"
varies greatly. Some species are limited to a stratum a few feet
in thickness; some may range through an entire formation and be
found but little modified in still higher beds. A formation may
"thus often be divided into zones, each characterized by its own"
"peculiar species. As a rule, the simpler organisms have a longer"
"duration as species, though not as individuals, than the more"
complex.
"shell; she would go, she would carry his valuable to this man,"
"our relative-in-law. Next day, he would yomelu; he would catch"
"a pig, he would break off a bunch of betel-nut, he would cut"
"sugar cane, bananas, he would fill the baskets with food, and"
spike the coco-nut on a multi-forked piece of wood. By-and-by
he would bring it. Our house would be filled up. Later on we
"would make a distribution of the bananas, of the sugar cane, of"
"the betel-nut. We give it to our helpers. We sit, we sit (i.e.,"
"we wait); at harvest time he brings yams, he karibudaboda (he"
"gives the payment of that name), the necklace. He would bring"
the food and fill out our yam house.
"This narrative, like many pieces of native information, needs certain"
"corrections of perspective. In the first place, events here succeed one"
another with a rapidity quite foreign to the extremely leisurely way in
which natives usually accomplish such a lengthy process as the making
"of a katudababile. The amount of food which, in the usual manner,"
is enumerated over and over again in this narrative would probably
"not be exaggerated, for--such is native economy--a man who makes a"
necklace to order would get about twice as much or even more for it
"than it would fetch in any other transaction. On the other hand,"
it must be remembered that what is represented here as the final
"payment, the karibudaboda, is nothing else but the normal filling up"
"of the yam house, always done by a man's relations-in-law. None the"
"less, in a year in which a katudababile would be made, the ordinary"
yearly harvest gift would be styled the 'karibudaboda payment for
"the necklace.' The giving of the necklace to the wife, who afterwards"
"carries it to her brother or kinsman, is also characteristic of the"
relation between relatives-in-law.
In Sinaketa and Vakuta only the necklaces made of bigger shell and
room.
"When Grey awoke next morning, the sun was shining; a frugal but"
sufficient meal was spread upon the table; a fire was blazing cheerily
"upon the hearth; and there was the Old Lion, with his manuscript before"
"him, muttering beneath his breath, and throwing out his hand in telling"
"gesture, making so fine a picture with his leonine face and shaggy mane"
of hair that Grey watched him awhile in silence before advancing.
"""Good-morrow, and welcome to you, my son,"" was the greeting be received."
"""I have had a beautiful night.  The muse was hot upon me.  The rounded"
periods seemed to flow from my pen without effort. Let us to breakfast
"first; then shall you read what I have written, and together we will"
"amend it, if need be.  But first shall you remove hither from that"
unsavoury lodging of which you did speak. Here is money: pay your
"reckoning, and bring hither any goods and chattels you may value.  We"
"must dwell together these next weeks.  We will work hard, and before the"
week closes I will have some manager here to listen to our rendering of
this scene.  We will have the world crowding to see and hear us
"yet!—King Fortune, I salute thee, and I thank thee from my heart that"
"thou didst send this goodly youth to me, and didst prompt my heart from"
"the first to take note of him and seek his friendship."""
"The removal of Grey’s simple belongings took but little time, and lucky"
did he feel himself to be able to call this comfortable abode his home.
A small attic upon the same floor of the house made him a sleeping
"chamber at very small cost, and his days were spent in the sunny south"
"garret, which was called the Lion’s Den; and there they studied, and"
"wrote, and rehearsed this eulogy upon the Duke, and the prowess of the"
"English arms, the old man introducing here and there allusions and"
"innuendoes which Grey scarcely understood, but which Wylde declared"
"would bring down thunders of applause from the house—as, indeed, proved"
"to the trust, but their owners were bound at all times to allow a normal"
"head of water when it was called for. Instead of doing this now, they"
played all sorts of tricks on Bainbridge. When he particularly needed
"plenty of water to float his drive past a shallow or narrow spot, the"
"gates were arbitrarily shut down, and the drive hung up. Again, at one"
point where the middle part of the drive had jammed and the crew were
"occupied in picking it instead of using dynamite, the gates which Bob"
"had personally closed were raised without warning, letting down a flood"
"of water which struck the jam with terrific force. It gave instantly,"
"carrying three men with it. Two managed to escape by a miracle, and were"
dragged ashore with broken limbs; the other was crushed and drowned.
After that Bainbridge placed guards at the various dams with
instructions to shoot any one who attempted to interfere with them. This
"resulted in a terrific outcry on the part of Crane’s underlings, an"
"appeal to the law, injunctions, and all that sort of thing. To which"
"Bainbridge paid no attention whatever. He went on his way calmly,"
"knowing well that they could not stop him in this manner, and willing to"
put up with the inconvenience that would follow when it was all over and
he had returned to civilization.
Mr. Wolcott Sears continued his fishing trip along the route the
"lumbermen were following, and began frequently to appear in camp for an"
"evening pipe with Bainbridge. One evening they had a private conference,"
"which lasted until the small hours, and the Boston capitalist finally"
"departed, leaving Bainbridge apparently much gratified."
The crew was with Bob to a man. By this time they had gathered an
"inkling of the plot against the firm, and of the stakes involved. Men"
had strayed into camp telling of the extraordinary reductions made by
the trust in the price of manufactured lumber. Large sales had resulted
"to various parties, report said, thus preventing Bainbridge & Tweedy, as"
from floor to ceiling of this very Hall. And beyond that arch the
"Laboratory merges imperceptibly into the garden, which is the true"
"laboratory for the study of Life. There the creepers, the plants and the"
"trees are played upon by their natural environments,--sunlight and wind,"
and the chill at midnight under the vault of starry space. There are
"other surroundings also, where they will be subjected to chromatic"
"action of different lights, to invisible rays, to electrified ground or"
thunder-charged atmosphere. Everywhere they will transcribe in their own
script the history of their experience. From this lofty point of
"observation, sheltered by the trees, the student will watch this"
"panorama of life. Isolated from all distractions, he will learn to"
attune himself with Nature; the obscuring veil will be lifted and he
will gradually come to see how community throughout the great ocean of
life outweighs apparent dissimilarity. Out of discord he will realise
the great harmony.
THE OUTLOOK
These are the dreams that wove a network round my wakeful life for many
"years past. The outlook is endless, for the goal is at infinity. The"
realisation cannot be through one life or one fortune but through the
co-operation of many lives and many fortunes. The possibility of a
fuller expansion will depend on very large endowments. But a beginning
"must be made, and this is the genesis of the foundation of this"
Institute. I came with nothing and shall return as I came; if something
"is accomplished in the interval, that would indeed be a privilege. What"
"I have I will offer, and one who had shared with me the struggles and"
"hardships that had to be faced, has wished to bequeath all that is hers"
for the same object. In all my struggling efforts I have not been
"altogether solitary while the world doubted, there had been a few, now"
"in the City of Silence, who never wavered in their trust."
It is true that to all Orientals death is a less fearful thing than it
"is to us. I do not know what may be the cause of this, courage certainly"
has little to do with it; but it is certain that the purely physical
"fear of death, that horror and utter revulsion that seizes the majority"
"of us at the idea of death, is absent from most Orientals. And yet this"
"cannot explain it all. For fear of death, though less, is still there,"
"is still a strong influence upon their lives, and it would seem that no"
religion which ignored this great fact could become a great living
religion.
"Religion is made for man, to fit his necessities, not man for religion,"
and yet the faith of Buddhism is not concerned with death.
"Consider our faith, how much of its teaching consists of how to avoid"
"the fear of death, how much of its consolation is for the death-bed. How"
we are taught all our lives that we should live so as not to fear death;
"how we have priests and sacraments to soothe the dying man, and give"
"him hope and courage, and how the crown and summit of our creed is that"
we should die easily. And consider that in Buddhism all this is
"absolutely wanting. Buddhism is a creed of life, of conduct; death is"
"the end of that life, that is all."
"We have all seen death. We have all of us watched those who, near and"
"dear to us, go away out of our ken. There is no need for me to recall"
"the last hours of those of our faith, to bring up again the fading eye"
"and waning breath, the messages of hope we search for in our Scriptures"
"to give hope to him who is going, the assurances of religion, the cross"
held before the dying eyes.
"Many men, we are told, turn to religion at the last after a life of"
"wickedness, and a man may do so even at the eleventh hour and be saved."
"February 1917, to the students of the Presidency College on receiving"
their _Arghya_ and congratulations on the occasion of his knighthood. It
"was published in the Modern Review for March 1917--Volume XXI, p. 343."
"In your congratulations for the recent honour, you have overlooked a"
"still greater that came to me a year ago, when I was gazetted as your"
"perpetual professor, so that the tie which binds me to you is never to"
be severed. Thirty-two years ago I sought to be your teacher. For the
trust that you imposed on me could I do anything less than place before
you the highest that I knew? I never appealed to your weaknesses but
your strength. I never set before you that was easy but used all the
compulsion for the choice of the most difficult. And perhaps as a
reward for these years of effort I find all over India those who have
been my pupils occupying positions of the highest trust and
responsibility in different walks of life. I do not merely count those
who have won fame and success but I also claim many others who have
taken up the burden of life manfully and whose life of purity and
unselfishness has brought gleams of joy in suffering lives.
THE LAW UNIVERSAL
Through science I was able to teach you how the seeming veils the real;
"how though the garish lights dazzle and blind us, there are lights"
"invisible, which glow persistently after the brief flare burns out. One"
"came to realise how all matter was one, how unified all life was. In the"
various expressions of life even in the realm of thought the same
"Universal law prevails. There was no such thing as brute matter, but"
that spirit suffused matter in which it was enshrined. One also realised
"dimly a mysterious Cyclic Law of Change, seen not merely in inorganic"
matter but also in organised life and its highest manifestations. One
saw how inertness passes into the climax of activity and how that climax
results attending them. Wounds were met with in every part of the small
gut; but I saw no case in which an injury to the duodenum could be
specially diagnosed.
"As to the symptoms which attended these injuries, it is somewhat"
"difficult to speak with precision, and it must be left to my readers to"
form an opinion as to how many of the cases recounted below were really
instances of perforating wounds. My own view is that in the majority of
"the cases that got well spontaneously, the injury was not of a"
"perforating nature, and that for reasons which have been already set"
"forth. It will, however, be at once noted that in all the five cases in"
which the injury was certainly diagnosed in hospital death occurred.
The cases of injury to the small intestine are perhaps best arranged in
three classes.
"1. Those who died upon the field, or shortly after removal from it. In"
"these the external wounds were often large, the omentum was not rarely"
"prolapsed, and escape of fæces sometimes occurred early. Shock from the"
"severity of the lesion, and hæmorrhage, were no doubt important factors"
in the early lethal issue in this class. Many of the injuries were no
"doubt produced by bullets striking irregularly, by ricochets, by bullets"
"of the expanding forms, or by bullets of large calibre. As being beyond"
"the bounds of surgical aid, this class possessed the least interest."
"2. Cases brought into the Field, or even the Stationary hospitals, with"
"symptoms of moderate severity, or even of an insignificant character,"
in which evidence of septic peritonitis suddenly developed and death
ensued.
3. Cases in which the position of the wounds raised the possibility of
"injury to the intestine, but in which the symptoms were slight or of"
"I have not, indeed, always attempted to reach the explanation of things"
I have seen. When I have satisfied myself that a belief is really held
"by the people, that I am not the subject of conscious deception, either"
"by myself or others, I have conceived that my work was ended."
"There are those who, in investigating any foreign customs and strange"
"beliefs, can put their finger here and say, 'This is where they are"
"right'; and there and say, 'This belief is foolishly wrong and idiotic.'"
"I am not, unfortunately, one of these writers. I have no such confident"
belief in my own infallibility of judgment as to be able to sit on high
"and say, 'Here is truth, and here is error.'"
"I will leave my readers to make their own judgment, if they desire to do"
so; only asking them (as they would not like their own beliefs to be
scoffed and sneered at) that they will treat with respect the sincere
"beliefs of others, even if they cannot accept them. It is only in this"
way that we can come to understand a people and to sympathize with them.
It is hardly necessary to emphasize the enormous effect that a belief in
transmigration such as this has upon the life and intercourse of the
"people. Of their kindness to animals I have spoken elsewhere, and it is"
"possible this belief in transmigration has something to do with it, but"
"not, I think, much. For if you wished to illtreat an animal, it would be"
"quite easy, even more easy, to suppose that an enemy or a murderer"
"inhabited the body of the animal, and that you were but carrying out the"
"decrees of fate by ill-using it. But when you love an animal, it may"
"increase that love and make it reasonable, and not a thing to be ashamed"
"of; and it brings the animal world nearer to you in general, it bridges"
over the enormous void between man and beast that other religions have
made. Nothing humanizes a man more than love of animals.
is again one of the unsolved contradictions of his being. He _is_
precipitate and careless; he _wants_ to be careful and cautious; his
"mind drives him to be the first, his nature restrains him, but usually"
only after the word has been written and published. The result is a
continual intermingling of explosion and reserve.
The way in which Erasmus always tries to shirk definite statements
irritates us. How carefully he always tries to represent the
"_Colloquies_, in which he had spontaneously revealed so much of his"
"inner convictions, as mere trifling committed to paper to please his"
friends. They are only meant to teach correct Latin! And if anything is
"said in them touching matters of faith, it is not I who say it, is it?"
"As often as he censures classes or offices in the _Adagia_, princes"
"above all, he warns the readers not to regard his words as aimed at"
particular persons.
"Erasmus was a master of reserve. He knew, even when he held definite"
"views, how to avoid direct decisions, not only from caution, but also"
because he saw the eternal ambiguity of human issues.
"Erasmus ascribes to himself an unusual horror of lies. On seeing a liar,"
"he says, he was corporeally affected. As a boy he already violently"
"disliked mendacious boys, such as the little braggart of whom he tells"
in the _Colloquies_. That this reaction of aversion is genuine is not
contradicted by the fact that we catch Erasmus himself in untruths.
"Inconsistencies, flattery, pieces of cunning, white lies, serious"
"suppression of facts, simulated sentiments of respect or sorrow--they"
may all be pointed out in his letters. He once disavowed his deepest
conviction for a gratuity from Anne of Borselen by flattering her
bigotry. He requested his best friend Batt to tell lies in his behalf.
"He most sedulously denied his authorship of the Julius dialogue, for"
"fear of the consequences, even to More, and always in such a way as to"
He is a bit of a softy from the look of him. That tender-hearted lot
"are always the most obstinate when asked to give away their pals."""
"""Do you know, Dawson,"" I said, as he went upstairs with me to have a"
"lick and a polish, as he put it--""I am inclined to agree with Cary"
"that you are rather an inhuman beast."""
"My wife, with whom I could exchange no more than a dozen words and a"
"wink or two, gripped the situation and played up to it in the fashion"
which compels the admiration and terror of mere men. Do they humbug
"us, their husbands, as they do the rest of the world on our behalf?"
"She met Dawson as if he were an old family friend, heaped hospitality"
"upon him, and chaffed him blandly as if to entertain a police officer"
with a warrant and handcuffs in his pocket were the best joke in the
"world. ""My husband, Mr. Dawson, needs a holiday very badly, but won't"
take one. He thinks that the war cannot be pursued successfully unless
he looks after it himself. If you would carry him off and keep him
"quiet for a bit, I should be deeply grateful."" She then fell into a"
discussion with Dawson of the most conveniently situated prisons. Mrs.
"Copplestone dismissed Dartmoor and Portland as too bleakly situated,"
but was pleased to approve of Parkhurst in the Isle of Wight--which I
rather fancy is a House of Detention for women. She insisted that the
"climate of the Island was suited to my health, and wrung a promise"
"from Dawson that I should, if possible, be interned there. Dawson's"
manners and conversation surprised me. His homespun origin was
"evident, yet he had developed an easy social style which was neither"
"familiar nor aggressive. We were in his eyes eccentrics, possibly what"
"he would call among his friends ""a bit off,"" and he bore himself"
"towards us accordingly. My small daughter, Jane, to whom he had been"
presented as a colonel of police--little Jane is deeply versed in
"military ranks--took to him at once, and his manner towards her"
confirmed my impression that some vestiges of humanity may still be
"people of pernicious vows, if only they repent of them,' says the man"
who himself had broken a vow.
There is in Erasmus a dangerous fusion between inclination and
conviction. The correlations between his idiosyncrasies and his precepts
are undeniable. This has special reference to his point of view in the
matter of fasting and abstinence from meat. He too frequently vents his
"own aversion to fish, or talks of his inability to postpone meals, not"
to make this connection clear to everybody. In the same way his personal
"experience in the monastery passes into his disapproval, on principle,"
of monastic life.
"The distortion of the image of his youth in his memory, to which we have"
"referred, is based on that need of self-justification. It is all"
unconscious interpretation of the undeniable facts to suit the ideal
which Erasmus had made of himself and to which he honestly thinks he
answers. The chief features of that self-conceived picture are a
"remarkable, simple sincerity and frankness, which make it impossible to"
him to dissemble; inexperience and carelessness in the ordinary concerns
of life and a total lack of ambition. All this is true in the first
"instance: there is a superficial Erasmus who answers to that image, but"
it is not the whole Erasmus; there is a deeper one who is almost the
opposite and whom he himself does not know because he will not know him.
"Possibly because behind this there is a still deeper being, which is"
truly good.
"Does he not ascribe weaknesses to himself? Certainly. He is, in spite of"
"his self-coddling, ever dissatisfied with himself and his work."
"_Putidulus_, he calls himself, meaning the quality of never being"
content with himself. It is that peculiarity which makes him
"dissatisfied with any work of his directly after it has appeared, so"
that he always keeps revising and supplementing. 'Pusillanimous' he
"crew turned pirates, and sailed to the Red Sea. Here he met with a great"
"Indian ship, which he had the hardiness to attack, and soon took her, and"
"each of his men received as his share £3,000, and with this booty they"
sailed to Madagascar. He was already held in high esteem by the pirates
"who resided in that favourite stronghold. At one time he joined Misson,"
"the originator of ""piracy-without-tears"" at his garden city of Libertatia."
A quarrel arose between Misson's French followers and Tew's English
"pirates. A duel was arranged between the two leaders, but by the tact of"
"another pirate--an unfrocked Italian priest--all was settled amicably, Tew"
being appointed Admiral and the diplomatic ex-priest suitably chosen as
Secretary of State to the little republic. Such a reputation for kindness
"had Tew that ships seldom resisted him, but on knowing who their assailant"
was they gave themselves up freely. Some of Tew's men started a daughter
"colony on their own account, and the Admiral sailed after them to try and"
"persuade them to return to the fold at Libertatia. The men refused, and"
"while Tew was arguing and trying to persuade them to change their minds,"
his ship was lost in a sudden storm. Tew was soon rescued by the ship
"_Bijoux_ with Misson on board, who, with a few men, had escaped being"
"massacred by the natives. Misson, giving Tew an equal share of his gold"
"and diamonds, sailed away, while Tew managed to return to Rhode Island in"
"New England, where he settled down for a while. To show the honesty of"
"this man, being now affluent, he kept a promise to the friends in Bermuda"
"who originally set him up with a ship, by sending them fourteen times the"
original cost of the sloop as their just share of the profits.
"At last, Tew found the call of the sea and the lure of the ""grand account"""
"too great to resist, and he consented to take command of a pirate ship"
"which was to go on a cruise in the Red Sea. Arrived there, Tew attacked a"
"big ship belonging to the Great Mogul, and during the battle was mortally"
wounded.
"His historian tells us ""a shot carried away the rim of Tew's belly, who"
"Chiriqui, light of color, believing that the Great Spirit lived in the"
"volcano of Chiriqui, and occasionally showing their displeasure with him"
"by shooting arrows at the mountain. The Guaymies, of whom perhaps 6000"
"are left, are the tribe that buried with their dead the curious golden"
"images that were once plentiful in the bazaars of Panama, but are now"
hard to find. They have a pleasant practice of putting a calabash of
water and some plantains by a man they think dying and leaving him to
"his fate, usually in some lonesome part of the jungle. The Cunas or"
"Caribs are the tribes inhabiting the Darien. All were, and some are,"
believed still to be cannibals. Eleven lesser tribes are grouped under
this general name. As a rule they are small and muscular. Most of them
"have abandoned their ancient gaudy dress, and so far as they are clothed"
at all wear ordinary cotton clothing. Painting the face and body is
still practiced. The dead often are swung in hammocks from trees and
supplied with fresh provisions until the cords rot and the body falls to
the ground. Then the spirit’s journey to the promised land is held to be
ended and provisions are no longer needed. Sorcery and soothsaying are
"much in vogue, and the sorcerers who correspond to the medicine men of"
our North American Indians will sometimes shut themselves up in a small
"hut shrieking, beating tom-toms and imitating the cries of wild animals."
When they emerge in a sort of self-hypnotized state they are held to be
peculiarly fit for prophesying.
[Illustration: NATIVE VILLAGE AT CAPERA]
"All the Indians drink heavily, and the white man’s rum is to some extent"
"displacing the native drink of chica. This is manufactured by the women,"
"usually the old ones, who sit in a circle chewing yam roots or cassava"
and expectorating the saliva into a large bowl in the center. This
ferments and is made the basis of a highly intoxicating drink. Curiously
enough the same drink is similarly made in far-away Samoa. The dutiful
wives after thus manufacturing the material upon which their spouses get
and a wedge of clearance showed. Almost imperceptibly she drew back and
rubbed against the timbers. A fender began to squeeze and complain. The
dock planking creaked. Sixty seconds more and she would be out of
"arm's-reach, and still George made no haste. Again Boyd shouted at him,"
and then with one farewell glower over his shoulder the big fellow
"mounted a pile, stretched his arms upward to the bulwarks, and swung"
himself lightly aboard.
"Even yet Emerson's anxiety was of the keenest; for, notwithstanding the"
"stress of these dragging moments, he had not forgotten Fraser, the"
"vagabond, the morally twisted rascal, to whose courage and"
resourcefulness he owed so much. He strained his eyes for a glimpse of
"the fellow, at the same time dreading the sight of a uniform. Would the"
ship never get under way and out of hailing distance? If those officers
"had discovered their mistake, they might yet have time to stop him. He"
"vowed desperately that he would not let them, not if he had to take"
_The Bedford Castle_ to sea with a gun at the back of her helmsman. He
"made his way hurriedly to the bridge, where he hastily explained to"
"Captain Peasley his evasion of the officers; and here he found Cherry,"
"her face flushed, her eyes sparkling with excitement, but far too wise"
to speak to him in his present state of mind.
A scattered shower of missiles came aboard as the strikers kept pace
"with the steamer to the end of the slip, exciting the fishermen, who"
"had again mounted the rigging, to a simian frenzy. Oaths, insults, and"
jeers were hurled back and forth; but as the big steamer gathered
"momentum and slid out of her berth, they grew gradually more"
"indistinct, until at last they became muffled, broken, and meaningless."
"Even then the rival ranks continued to volley profanely at each other,"
"while the Captain, with hand on the whistle-rope, blew taunting blasts;"
nor did the fishermen descend from their perches until the forms on the
"dock had blurred together and the city lay massed in the distance, tier"
"first holiday which she had known since August, 1914. She always seems"
to travel with fewer restrictions and at greater speed than any except
Prime Ministers and commanding Generals. In Italy she is an Italian and
in France a Frenchwoman--a dazzling Italian and a very winning
Frenchwoman. The police of both countries make smooth her path with
their humble bodies upon which Madame is graciously pleased to trample.
"""I never trouble much about passports or credentials,"" says she, ""though"
I carry them just as I do my .25 automatic pistol; in practice I find
that I need draw my papers as rarely as I draw my gun. Most of the
"police and officials who have seen me once know me when I come again,"
"and rush to my assistance."" She is never grateful for service. I do not"
believe she knows the sentiment of gratitude. A poor man renders her aid
"in defiance of regulations, and maybe at the risk of his neck; she"
"smiles upon him, and the debt is instantly discharged. He is dismissed"
until perchance Madame may again have occasion for his devotion. Then
she reveals the royal accomplishment of never forgetting a face. Imagine
"a harassed, weary _chef du train_, before whose official unseeing eyes"
"travellers flit like figures on a cinema screen, imagine such a one"
addressed by name and rank by the most beautiful and gracious of mortal
"women, by a woman who remembers all those little family confidences"
"which he had poured into her sympathetic ears some twelve months before,"
by a woman who enquires sweetly after his good wife--using her pet
name--laments that the brave son--also accurately named--is still
missing beyond those impenetrable Boche lines. Will not the _chef du
"train_, cooed over thus and softly patted as one pats butter, break"
every French rule the most iron-bound to speed Madame upon her way? Of
"course he will. In war time, as in peace time, that is the royal manner"
of Madame Gilbert. She does not travel; she makes a progress.
"Madame came home after the armistice with Austria, and, being discharged"
"of liability to the propagandist headquarters, found herself a free and"
idle woman. The first time for more than four years.
admitted to this school to be educated at the charges of the King of
"France (April, 1779). He was now, at the tender age of nine, a"
"stranger in a strange land, among a people whom he detested as the"
"oppressors of his countrymen. Worst of all, he had to endure the taunt"
of belonging to a subject race. What a position for a proud and
exacting child! Little wonder that the official report represented him
"as silent and obstinate; but, strange to say, it added the word"
"""imperious."" It was a tough character which could defy repression"
"amidst such surroundings. As to his studies, little need be said. In"
his French history he read of the glories of the distant past (when
"""Germany was part of the French Empire""), the splendours of the reign"
"of Louis XIV., the disasters of France in the Seven Years' War, and"
"the ""prodigious conquests of the English in India."" But his"
imagination was kindled from other sources. Boys of pronounced
character have always owed far more to their private reading than to
"their set studies; and the young Buonaparte, while grudgingly learning"
"Latin and French grammar, was feeding his mind on Plutarch's"
"""Lives""--in a French translation. The artful intermingling of the"
"actual and the romantic, the historic and the personal, in those vivid"
"sketches of ancient worthies and heroes, has endeared them to many"
minds. Rousseau derived unceasing profit from their perusal; and
"Madame Roland found in them ""the pasture of great souls."" It was so"
with the lonely Corsican youth. Holding aloof from his comrades in
"gloomy isolation, he caught in the exploits of Greeks and Romans a"
distant echo of the tragic romance of his beloved island home. The
librarian of the school asserted that even then the young soldier had
modelled his future career on that of the heroes of antiquity; and we
"may well believe that, in reading of the exploits of Leonidas,"
"Curtius, and Cincinnatus, he saw the figure of his own antique"
"republican hero, Paoli. To fight side by side with Paoli against the"
"French was his constant dream. ""Paoli will return,"" he once exclaimed,"
"""and as soon as I have strength, I will go to help him: and perhaps"
"camp. At Brienne he had been dubbed ""the Spartan,"" an instance of that"
almost uncanny faculty of schoolboys to dash off in a nickname the
"salient features of character. The phrase was correct, almost for"
"Napoleon's whole life. At any rate, the pomp of Paris served but to"
root his youthful affections more tenaciously in the rocks of Corsica.
"In September, 1785, that is, at the age of sixteen, Buonaparte was"
nominated for a commission as junior lieutenant in La Fère regiment of
artillery quartered at Valence on the Rhone. This was his first close
contact with real life. The rules of the service required him to
spend three months of rigorous drill before he was admitted to his
"commission. The work was exacting: the pay was small, viz., 1,120"
"francs, or less than £45, a year; but all reports agree as to his keen"
zest for his profession and the recognition of his transcendent
abilities by his superior officers.[8] There it was that he mastered
"the rudiments of war, for lack of which many generals of noble birth"
have quickly closed in disaster careers that began with promise:
"there, too, he learnt that hardest and best of all lessons, prompt"
"obedience. ""To learn obeying is the fundamental art of governing,"""
says Carlyle. It was so with Napoleon: at Valence he served his
apprenticeship in the art of conquering and the art of governing.
This spring-time of his life is of interest and importance in many
"ways: it reveals many amiable qualities, which had hitherto been"
blighted by the real or fancied scorn of the wealthy cadets. At
"Valence, while shrinking from his brother officers, he sought society"
more congenial to his simple tastes and restrained demeanour. In a few
"of the best bourgeois families of Valence he found happiness. There,"
"too, blossomed the tenderest, purest idyll of his life. At the country"
"house of a cultured lady who had befriended him in his solitude, he"
"saw his first love, Caroline de Colombier. It was a passing fancy;"
but to her all the passion of his southern nature welled forth. She
"in the building. Nevertheless, its chief attraction, to the devout"
"Roman Catholic mind, is neither the bones of the Maccabees nor the"
"statue of Moses, but the chains referred to in the following familiar"
"passage of Scripture: ""Peter therefore was kept in prison; but prayer"
was made without ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when Herod
"would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between"
two soldiers bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door
"kept the prison. And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a"
"light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the side, and raised"
"him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his"
"hands."" (Acts xii. 5-7.) These two chains were presented by Juvenal,"
"Bishop of Jerusalem, to the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius the"
"younger, who placed one of them in the Basilica of the apostles in"
"Constantinople and sent the other to Rome, where this church was"
erected as its special shrine. This was about the middle of the fifth
"century. ""But the Romans could not rest satisfied with the possession"
"of half the relic; and within the walls of this very basilica, Leo"
I. beheld in a vision the miraculous and mystical uniting of the two
"chains, since which they have both been exhibited here, and the day of"
"their being soldered together by invisible power, August 1st, has been"
"kept sacred in the Latin church!"" ""They are of unequal size, owing to"
"many fragments of one of them (first whole links, then only filings)"
having been removed in the course of centuries by various popes and
sent to Christian princes who have been esteemed worthy of the favor!
The longest is about five feet in length. At the end of one of them is
"a collar, which is said to have encircled the neck of St. Peter. They"
are exposed on the day of the 'station' (the first Monday in Lent) in a
"reliquary presented by Pius IX., adorned with statuettes of St. Peter"
"and the Angel--to whom he is represented as saying, '_Ecce nunc scio"
vere_' (Acts xii. II). On the following day a priest gives the chains
"to be kissed by the pilgrims, and touches their foreheads with them,"
"saying, 'By the intercession of the blessed Apostle Peter, may God"
envy and undeserved hatred borne to me by the Lord Keeper.'[161] It is
not difficult to see in the Archbishop's relations to the Lord Keeper an
explanation of his dream.
"If, however, wishes, conscious or unconscious, are often fulfilled"
"in dreams, and if, as we have seen reason to conclude, symbolism is"
"a fundamental tendency of dreaming activity, it is inevitable that"
"wish-dreams should sometimes take on a symbolic form. It is thus, for"
"instance, that I interpret my dream of being in an English cathedral and"
seeing on the wall a notice to the effect that at evensong on such a day
"the edifice will not be illuminated, in order to avoid attracting moths;"
"I awake with a slight headache, and the unilluminated cathedral was"
the symbol of the coolness and absence of glare which one desires when
suffering from headache.
"There cannot, also, be any doubt that erotic wishes frequently make"
"themselves felt as dreams, both in the infantile and the symbolic form."
It is sufficient to bring forward one illustration. It is furnished
"by a young lady of somewhat neurotic tendencies and heredity, aged"
"twenty-three, musical and intelligent, who was in love with her"
"music-master, the organist at her church. The dream was written down at"
"the time. 'I was at the school of my childhood, and I was told that I"
"was St. Agnes Virgin and Martyr, and in five minutes' time I was to be"
beheaded with a large knife. The sheen of the blade frightened me so much
that I asked if instead I might be strangled by the man I was in love
with. Permission was given if I could induce him to come in time. I ran
"to our church (saying to myself that I knew it was a dream, but that I"
"_must_ see what he would say) over huge stones that cut my bare feet, and"
"wondered what age I was living in, longing to meet some women in order to"
"find out. When I did, they all wore crinolines. I rushed up the central"
"aisle, which was full of people, thinking that, as I was going to be"
"killed, nothing could matter. Mr. T. (the organist) was giving a choir"
"""They seek to destroy the Revolution by attacking my person: I will"
"defend it, for I am the Revolution."" Such were the words uttered by"
Buonaparte after the failure of the royalist plot of 1804. They are a
"daring transcript of Louis XIV.'s ""L'état, c'est moi."" That was a bold"
"claim, even for an age attuned to the whims of autocrats: but this of"
"the young Corsican is even more daring, for he thereby equated himself"
with a movement which claimed to be wide as humanity and infinite as
"truth. And yet when he spoke these words, they were not scouted as"
presumptuous folly: to most Frenchmen they seemed sober truth and
"practical good sense. How came it, one asks in wonder, that after the"
short space of fifteen years a world-wide movement depended on a
"single life, that the infinitudes of 1789 lived on only in the form,"
"and by the pleasure, of the First Consul? Here surely is a political"
incarnation unparalleled in the whole course of human history. The
riddle cannot be solved by history alone. It belongs in part to the
"domain of psychology, when that science shall undertake the study, not"
"merely of man as a unit, but of the aspirations, moods, and whims of"
communities and nations. Meanwhile it will be our far humbler task to
"strive to point out the relation of Buonaparte to the Revolution, and"
to show how the mighty force of his will dragged it to earth.
The first questions that confront us are obviously these. Were the
"lofty aims and aspirations of the Revolution attainable? And, if so,"
did the men of 1789 follow them by practical methods? To the former of
"these questions the present chapter will, in part at least, serve as"
an answer. On the latter part of the problem the events described in
later chapters will throw some light: in them we shall see that the
great popular upheaval let loose mighty forces that bore Buonaparte on
to fortune.
Here we may notice that the Revolution was not a simple and therefore
condemnation from outside is useless and is always discredited. In all
"probability the Allies and the Central Powers are both equally bad, and"
"to denounce the enemy only is mere yelping with the rest of the savage,"
"vindictive pack."""
"""That is true, but what is the good of saying it, or thinking it!"
"Ignorance, prejudice, and intellectual dishonesty are far stronger than"
you are. The depravity of mankind is such that only failure and
humiliation will carry conviction. Mere words are only wasted. If any
"nation is completely defeated in this war, then its people will rise"
"against its rulers, whether they are guilty or not, and they will fix"
all the responsibility of war upon them and upon themselves. There will
be a frenzy of self-accusation--whether just or unjust it doesn't
"matter--and as for the victors, they will say: 'Our enemies admit their"
"guilt, so what further proof is needed?' Where the _real_ guilt is, that"
is an irrelevant and trivial question. Success or failure will be the
sole ultimate criterion. There is only one hope for the world--that
failure will be so evenly distributed that there will be anxious
heart-searchings in every country. Failure alone makes ignorant people
"think. Success is taken for granted. Even after a single battle lost,"
"the Press is full of explanations and excuses, but after a battle won,"
"there is only complacency and self-glorification, and questions as to"
"the why and wherefore are considered out of place or even treasonable."""
"When we parted I was seized with a feeling of intense loneliness, but"
nevertheless I realized with satisfaction that I was not entirely alone.
I also gave up the idea of enjoying my leave and conceived a deep
aversion for all pleasures and amusements.
"The next day I wandered into the British Museum. The 600,000 volumes"
that surrounded me on the shelves of the reading-room had a depressing
"effect. I took out a few books, but was too distracted for serious"
"western colleague, and last but not least, the point of view of the"
Indian pupils themselves. In all these respects his experience had been
wide and varied. He had both been an undergraduate and a graduate of the
Calcutta University with vivid realization of an Indian student's
aspirations; he had then become a student of conservative Cambridge and
democratic London. And during his frequent visits to Europe and America
he had become acquainted with the inner working of the chief
universities of the world. Finally he had the unique privilege of being
"connected with the Presidency College for thirty-one years, from which"
no temptation could sever him. He had the deepest sense of the sacred
vocation of the teacher. They may well be proud of a consecrated
"life--consecrated to what? To the guidance of young lives, to the making"
"of men, to the shaping and determining of souls in the dawn of their"
"existence, with their dreams yet to be realised."
Education in the West and in the East showed how different customs and
"ways might yet express a common ideal. In India the teacher was, like"
"the head of a family, reverenced by his pupils so deeply as to show"
itself by touching the feet of their master. This in no servile act if
we come to think of it; since it is the expression of the pupils' desire
"for his master's blessings, called down from heaven in an almost"
"religious communion of souls. This consecration is renewed every day,"
calling forth patient foresight of the teacher. As the father shows no
"special favour, but lets his love and compassion go out to the weakest,"
so it is with the Indian teacher and his pupil. There is the relation
"something very human, something very ennobling. He would say it was"
essentially human rather than distinctively Eastern. For do we not find
something very like it in Mediaeval Europe? There too before the coming
of the modern era with its lack of leisure and its adherence to system
"and machinery, there was a bond as sacred between the master and his"
"pupils. Luther used to salute his class every morning with lifted hat,"
"""I bow to you, great men of the future, famous administrators yet to be,"
filled his ear with slanderous reports. They had said that the queen's
"brother was the strongest man in all the kingdom. 'He was cunning, too,'"
"they said, 'and very popular among all the people; and he was so puffed"
"up with pride, now that his sister was a queen, that there was nothing"
he did not think he could do.' They represented to the king how
"dangerous such a man was in a kingdom, that it would be quite easy for"
"him to raise such rebellion as the king could hardly put down, and that"
"he was just the man to do such a thing. Nay, it was indeed proved that"
"he must be disloyally plotting something, or he would have come down"
with his sister to the city when she came. But now many months had
"passed, and he never came. Clearly he was not to be trusted. Any other"
"man whose sister was a queen would have come and lived in the palace,"
"and served the king and become a minister, instead of staying up there"
and pretending to be a blacksmith.
"The king's mind had been much disturbed by this, for it seemed to him"
"that it must be in part true; and he went to the queen, as I have said,"
"and his suspicions had not been lulled by what she told him, so he had"
ordered her to write to her brother to come down to the palace.
"The queen was terrified when she saw what a mistake she had made, and"
how she had fallen into the trap of her enemies; but she hoped that the
"king would forget, and she determined that she would send no order to"
"her brother to come. But the next day the king came back to the subject,"
"and asked her if she had yet sent the letter, and she said 'No!' The"
"king was very angry at this disobedience to his orders, and he asked her"
"how it came that she had not done as he had commanded, and sent a"
letter to her brother to call him to the palace.
Then the queen fell at the king's feet and told him all her fears that
"her brother was sent for only to be imprisoned or executed, and she"
begged and prayed the king to leave him in peace up there in his
"her eyes.  It was the first he had ever seen bent on him, and he was"
struck afresh with the pure unsullied beauty of this girl’s face.  Truth
"to tell, his first attraction towards her had been the rumour of her"
"fortune, for he was more deeply in debt than he wished the world to"
know; but something in the remoteness and isolation in which she seemed
to wrap herself piqued and interested him; for his jaded palate required
"fresh food when it was to be had, and the vein of manliness and strength"
which his life had never altogether warped or destroyed responded to the
sincerity he read in Lady Geraldine’s fair face.
The curtain was down now.  For a few minutes he spoke of the play and
"the water apparatus, worked by a windmill on the roof, which was"
exciting so much interest in London.  Geraldine’s eyes meantime
travelled round the box.  She saw her mother engrossed in gay talk with
a small circle of admirers; but one of these edged himself somewhat away
"from the rest, and finally stood apart, leaning against the wall of the"
box and surveying the house from that vantage point.
"Geraldine’s eyes were riveted with some interest upon this newcomer,"
whom she was certain she had never seen before.  In some indefinable way
he was different from the men she had been used to meet at such places.
"For one thing, he wore his own hair; and the floating brown curls, like"
"Cavalier love-locks, seemed to her infinitely more becoming than the"
mass of false hair which was so much in vogue in all ranks save the
"lowest.  His dress, too, though far more simple than that of the beaux"
"fluttering round her mother, seemed to her far more graceful and"
"distinguished.  His stockings, breeches, and vest were all of white,"
"with a little silver frosting.  His coat was of pale blue, with silver"
"buttons; and his lace cravat, though small and unostentatious, was rich"
"in quality, and fastened by a beautiful pearl.  He carried neither muff"
"nor snuff-box, cane nor toothpick.  He did not simper nor ogle, nor look"
as though he desired to attract the eyes of the house upon himself.  But
"and reared at Geneva, he felt a Switzer's love for a people which was<"
"""neither rich nor poor but self-sufficing ""; and in the simple life"
and fierce love of liberty of the hardy islanders he saw traces of
that social contract which he postulated as the basis of society.
"According to him, the beginnings of all social and political"
institutions are to be found in some agreement or contract between
"men. Thus arise the clan, the tribe, the nation. The nation may"
"delegate many of its powers to a ruler; but if he abuse such powers,"
"the contract between him and his people is at an end, and they may"
"return to the primitive state, which is founded on an agreement of"
equals with equals. Herein lay the attractiveness of Rousseau for all
who were discontented with their surroundings. He seemed infallibly
to demonstrate the absurdity of tyranny and the need of returning to
the primitive bliss of the social contract. It mattered not that the
said contract was utterly unhistorical and that his argument teemed
with fallacies. He inspired a whole generation with detestation of the
"present and with longings for the golden age. Poets had sung of it,"
but Rousseau seemed to bring it within the grasp of long-suffering
mortals.
"The first extant manuscript of Napoleon, written at Valence in April,"
"1786, shows that he sought in Rousseau's armoury the logical weapons"
"for demonstrating the ""right"" of the Corsicans to rebel against the"
French. The young hero-worshipper begins by noting that it is the
birthday of Paoli. He plunges into a panegyric on the Corsican
"patriots, when he is arrested by the thought that many censure them"
"for rebelling at all. ""The divine laws forbid revolt. But what have"
divine laws to do with a purely human affair? Just think of the
absurdity--divine laws universally forbidding the casting off of a
"usurping yoke! ... As for human laws, there cannot be any after the"
"prince violates them."" He then postulates two origins for government"
as alone possible. Either the people has established laws and
"practice in the vestry. I ran up to him and said: ""Come at once, I am"
"going to be killed."" He became very angry, and said: ""Do go away; you are"
"always interrupting my choir practice."" I said: ""Don't you understand? I"
"am going to be killed at once; there is a knife hanging over my head, but"
"I would rather be strangled by you, and they said I could if I fetched you"
"in time."" As soon as he understood that he came at once. Then it seemed"
"in the dream that we were married, and had a son, who was to be a musical"
"composer. I said I must say goodbye to this son first, and told the nurse"
"to bring him to me. When he came I said: ""Good-bye, I am going to be"
"killed."" He said, ""Mother, am I a boy or a girl? When I am with boys I"
"don't seem like them, and they call me a girl, and yet I don't look like"
"a girl."" I replied: ""You are both in one, because you are going to be a"
"perfect musical genius.""' In this dream, which represents the fulfilment"
"in sleep of an affection unsatisfied in life, we see side by side the"
"infantile and the symbolic fulfilments of the erotic wish, culminating in"
a gifted musical child. The wish to be strangled is an undoubted erotic
"symbol,[162] and it is significant that in the course of the dream the"
"accepted death by strangulation became fused with marriage, although the"
"idea of death still inconsistently survives, doubtless because dream"
consciousness failed to realise that the accepted form of death was a
subconsciously furnished symbol of the consummation of marriage.
The wish-dream of Freud's type has presented itself for consideration
"here, because it is a special and elaborate illustration of symbolism"
in dreaming. The important place of symbols in dreaming is by no means
"dependent on the validity of this particular type of dream, and we may now"
proceed to continue the discussion of the significance of the symbolic
tendency during sleep in its most important form.
The symbols we have so far been mainly concerned with have been the
result of a tendency of dreaming consciousness to objectify feelings and
affections within the organism in concrete objects or processes outside
hurled at St. Dominic one day when he found him lying prostrate in
"prayer. This stone is the most conspicuous object in the church, being"
"set up on a pillar about three feet high, right in the middle of the"
nave. Not far away is the marble slab on which the saint was lying at
the time that the formidable missile was thrown. The adversary's aim
"was not good, and the saint was not harmed. The second thing of chief"
"interest here is the Chapel of the Rosary, at the other end of the same"
"aisle in which the marble slab lies, built on the very spot where St."
Dominic had the vision in which he received the rosary from the hands
of the Virgin. The supernatural gift is commemorated in a beautiful
painting by Sassoferato. It is hardly necessary to explain to any of my
readers that a rosary is a string of beads used by Roman Catholics to
keep the count of the number of _Pater-nosters_ and _Ave-Marias_ which
"they repeat, and that this manner of ""vain repetitions"" was first used"
"by the Dominicans among Roman Catholics, though the custom was really"
"borrowed from the Mohammedans and Brahmins, who still use rosaries. The"
"third object is the famous orange tree, now six hundred and seventy"
"years old, which is said to have been brought from Spain and planted"
"in the court here by St. Dominic himself, orange trees having been"
"unknown in Rome before that time, and ""which still lives, and is firmly"
"believed to flourish or fail with the fortunes of the Dominican Order."""
"Ladies are not allowed to approach this tree, so, as there were ladies"
"in our party, we all contented ourselves with a look at it through a"
"window. Hard by, of course, there is a room where things are sold to"
"pilgrims and visitors. There we bought a rosary, the beads of which"
"are made of the fruit of the plant called the Thorn of Christ, with"
"the exception of the bead next to the cross, which is a tiny dried"
orange from St. Dominic's tree. Enclosed in the cross are a little
"piece of the wood of the tree, and some earth from the catacombs where"
"the bodies of Sts. Peter and Paul, and of the holy virgin martyrs,"
"Sts. Agnes and Cecilia, reposed for some time. The printed leaflet"
"which accompanies our purchase tells us that ""these rosaries, when"
"submitted itself to the prince, or the prince has established laws. In"
"the first case, the prince is engaged by the very nature of his office"
"to execute the covenants. In the second case, the laws tend, or do not"
"tend, to the welfare of the people, which is the aim of all"
"government: if they do not, the contract with the prince dissolves of"
"itself, for the people then enters again into its primitive state."
"Having thus proved the sovereignty of the people, Buonaparte uses his"
"doctrine to justify Corsican revolt against France, and thus concludes"
"his curious medley: ""The Corsicans, following all the laws of justice,"
"have been able to shake off the yoke of the Genoese, and may do the"
"same with that of the French. Amen."""
"Five days later he again gives the reins to his melancholy. ""Always"
"alone, though in the midst of men,"" he faces the thought of suicide."
With an innate power of summarizing and balancing thoughts and
"sensations, he draws up arguments for and against this act. He is in"
"the dawn of his days and in four months' time he will see ""la patrie,"""
which he has not seen since childhood. What joy! And yet--how men have
fallen away from nature: how cringing are his compatriots to their
"conquerors: they are no longer the enemies of tyrants, of luxury, of"
"vile courtiers: the French have corrupted their morals, and when ""la"
"patrie"" no longer survives, a good patriot ought to die. Life among"
the French is odious: their modes of life differ from his as much as
the light of the moon differs from that of the sun.--A strange
effusion this for a youth of seventeen living amidst the full glories
of the spring in Dauphiné. It was only a few weeks before the ripening
of cherries. Did that cherry-idyll with Mdlle. de Colombier lure him
back to life? Or did the hope of striking a blow for Corsica stay his
suicidal hand? Probably the latter; for we find him shortly afterwards
tilting against a Protestant minister of Geneva who had ventured to
criticise one of the dogmas of Rousseau's evangel.
rather a more serious matter with them than among some of the other
"Indians, the Chocoes for example. They wear as a rule blouses and two"
"skirts, where other denizens of the Darien dispense with clothing above"
the waist altogether. Their hair is usually kept short. The nose ring is
"looked upon as indispensable, and other ornaments of both gold and"
silver are worn by both sexes. Americans who have had much to do with
the Indians of the Darien always comment on the extreme reticence shown
"by them in speaking of their golden ornaments, or the spot whence they"
were obtained. It is as though vague traditions had kept alive the story
of the pestilence of fire and sword which ravaged their land when the
Spaniards swept over it in search of the yellow metal. Gold is in the
"Darien in plenty. Everybody knows that, and the one or two mines near"
the rivers now being worked afford sufficient proof that the region is
"auriferous. But no Indian will tell of the existence of these mines, nor"
will any guide a white man to the spot where it is rumored gold is to be
found. Seemingly ineradicably fixed in the inner consciousness of the
Indian is the conviction that the white man’s lust for the yellow metal
is the greatest menace that confronts the well-being of himself and his
people.
The San Blas are decidedly a town-dwelling tribe. They seem to hate
"solitude and even today, in their comparatively reduced state, build"
villages of a size that make understandable Balboa’s records of the size
"and state of the chief with whom he first fought, and then made friends."
"At Narganá are two large islands, fairly covered with spacious houses"
about 150 feet long by 50 broad. The ridge pole of the palm-thatched
roof is 30 to 40 feet from the ground. A long corridor runs through the
"house longitudinally, and on either side the space is divided by upright"
"posts into square compartments, each of which is supposed to house an"
entire family. The side walls are made of wattled reeds caked with clay.
"One of these houses holds from sixteen to twenty families, and the"
edifices are packed so closely together as to leave scarce room between
"Their father and mother were dead, and there was no one but those two,"
"the brother and sister, so they loved each other dearly, and thought of"
no one else. The brother brought home no wife to his house by the forge.
"He wanted no one while he had his sister there, and when lovers came"
"wooing to her, singing amorous songs in the amber dusk, she would have"
"nothing to do with them. So they lived there together, he growing"
"stronger and she more beautiful every day, till at last a change came."
"The old king died, and a new king came to the throne, and orders were"
sent about to all the governors of provinces and other officials that
the most beautiful maidens were to be sent down to the Golden City to be
wives to the great king. So the governor of that country sent for the
"blacksmith and his sister to his palace, and told them there what orders"
"he had received, and asked the blacksmith to give his sister that she"
might be sent as queen to the king. We are not told what arguments the
"governor used to gain his point, but only this, that when he failed, he"
"sent the girl in unto his wife, and there she was persuaded to go. There"
"must have been something very tempting, to one who was but a village"
"girl, in the prospect of being even one of the lesser queens, of living"
"in the palace, the centre of the world. So she consented at last, and"
"her brother consented, and the girl was sent down under fitting escort"
to find favour in the eyes of her king. But the blacksmith refused to
go. It was no good the governor saying such a great man as he must come
"to high honour in the Golden City, it was useless for the girl to beg"
and pray him to come with her--he always refused. So she sailed away
"down the great river, and the blacksmith returned to his forge."
"As the governor had said, the girl was acceptable in the king's sight,"
"and she was made at last one of the principal queens, and of all she had"
"most power over the king. They say she was most beautiful, that her"
"presence was as soothing as shade after heat, that her form was as"
"graceful as a young tree, and the palms of her hands were like lotus"
no one who did not know intimately their purpose and disposition could
"venture to tamper with them, for great numbers are always in use. If"
"any one cut the lighting wires, for instance, the defects would be"
obvious at once; so with the heating or telephone wires. Nothing was
"touched except the lines to the guns, of which there are eight"
disposed upon the deck. From the guns connections run to the switch
"room, the conning tower, the gunnery control platform aloft, and to"
the gunnery officer's bridge. It was the main cable between the switch
"room and the conning tower which was cut, and it was one cable laid"
alongside a dozen others. Now who could know that this was the gun
"cable, and the only one in which damage might escape detection while"
"the ship was in harbour? At sea there is constant gun drill, during"
"which the electrical controls and the firing-tubes are always tested,"
but in harbour the guns are lying idle most of the time. It was
"evidently the intention of the enemy, who cut these wires, that the"
"_Antinous_ should go to sea before the defect was discovered, and that"
her fire control should be out of action till the wiring system could
be repaired. That very serious disaster was prevented by the
"preliminary testing during the night before sailing, but the enemy has"
been successful in delaying the departure of an invaluable light
"cruiser for two days. In these days, when the war of observation is"
"more important even than the war of fighting, the services of light"
cruisers cannot be dispensed with for an hour without grave
inconvenience and risk. Yet here was one delayed for forty-eight hours
after her ordinary repairs had been completed. The naval authorities
are in a frightful stew. For what has happened to the _Antinous_ may
"happen to other cruisers, even to battleships. If there is sabotage"
"among the workmen in the shipyards, it must be discovered and stamped"
out without a moment's delay. This time it is the cutting of a wire
cable; at another time it may be some wilful injury far more serious.
A warship is a mass of delicate machinery to which a highly skilled
enemy agent might do almost infinite damage. Dawson has been run off
"who had stood his friend, even though suspicion, jealousy, and an"
imperious temper had changed friendship into something very like enmity.
Grey never for a moment dreamed of regarding himself as an aspirant for
that fair hand; but he knew that the motive which was urging him to
change the manner of his life and become a worthier and a better man was
"the hope that she might watch his career, and hear a whisper of his fame"
or his success; or that he might win some laurels in the fields of
"literature, art, or politics, which he might perchance in some sort lay"
at her feet.
"This, however, lurked in the background of his thoughts.  He scarcely"
owned to himself that he expected ever to look upon that fair face
again; hence the sensation of heart sickness which had rendered him
"well-nigh desperate for a few days, and had helped him to squander"
without a qualm the hoard which his previous successes had accumulated.
And now the end of this mad life of gay folly had come. He had drained
"the cup to the dregs, and found it bitter to the taste.  He had neither"
liking nor respect for the companions with whom he had associated.
Towards Lord Sandford his feelings were very mixed. The power of the man
"was too great to be shaken off entirely, nor could he despise or dislike"
him.  But the tie of friendship had snapped asunder.  A chasm had opened
"between them, and he felt that he was regarded, if not as a foe, yet as"
"something akin, and it needed not Dick’s words of warning to tell him"
that the less he saw of this man in the future the better it would be
for himself.
Sounds of laughter and revelry greeted his ears as he slipped quietly
out towards the paddock and shed where his horse had been stabled these
"past weeks, tended and exercised by Dick, and ready for whatever demand"
might be made upon him.  He greeted his master with a neigh of
"recognition, dropped his nose in the extended hand, and stood tranquil"
and content under Grey’s quiet caresses.  The glossy coat was satin

"- Let's go make our vision real, dude."
"- Yeah, no, my vision."
"- Yeah, I know, but we're sharing it."
"- Yeah, no."
We're not.
"Get out of here, man."
"Do you even know what friendship is, dude?"
"Does it have anything to do with taking all my money, my drugs, and apparently trying to share my girlfriend?"
- She's not your girlfriend.
- Go.
Get out of here.
"- Go, go."
Get out of here!
"- 'Til next time, Conner."
You need help.
Hey.
"Griff, get out of here!"
Griff!
"- Griff, what..."
"- Natasha, listen to me."
One of the greatest regrets of my life is that you and I...
- No!
"- Natasha, I have so much to tell you."
"- Griff, my boyfriend's upstairs."
- So leave him up there.
- You're high!
- I have important news.
I am no longer clean.
- Listen to me...
"- Griff, I haven't used in months."
You're taking out the recycling in the middle of the night in your pyjamas.
"I mean, what happened?"
"In that case, sir the camp is prepared to escape and evade on order through places in the wire and mines only ""A"" Team and Captain Nim know about."
- My compliments.
"- Thank you, sir."
Commander of this area runs everything by the book.
And I am with him to the nth degree.
And every piece of this equipment will be painted.
And every piece of this equipment will be numbered.
And every...
What in the hell is that?
BECKWORTH:
You make good coffee.
- Cholong coffee.
AMA:
"More coffee, sergeant?"
MULDOON:
"No, thanks."
GRIFFIN:
Brother!
"Boy, is it miserable out there!"
"And believe me, it's sure in hell stay-awake weather."
Don't you men have rain gear?
"Yeah, but it doesn't do any good in this lousy climate."
COLLIER:
Skipper!
"Savoy 3 is on the horn, sir."
Savoy 3 to Savoy 6.
NIM [OVER RADIO]:
This is Savoy 3.
I'm nearing home base.
I've thrown smoke.
Can you identify?
COLEMAN:
Owen...?
Flavors that are wow...
Dinner time honey...!
"....and these Thy gifts, for which we are about to receive,"
..please guide and direct us for all our days.
And protect us from evil.
Amen.
How was school today?
"you didn't go and spoil your dinner on me now, did you?"
Owen?
...No...
I didn't...
Eat.
"Please, honey."
Hello?
What?
"Look, I'm not gonna discuss this now?"
We're eating dinner
"we had an agreement, John."
I think maybe you better call my lawyer okay...?
Don't talk to me like that
I will not.
Be spoken to.
In that way!
Hey little girl...
Are you a little girl...?
are you scared?
I pledge allegiance... to the flag...
of the United States of America...
And to the Republic... for which it stands...
"One Nation... under God... indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
Mr. Zoric...?
Hello?
Ashley?
ASHLEY:
Hello.
Come out.
I have a surprise for you.
"'For the past year, they had been living together, 'one advantage of which was added stability,"

"'Philip would credit this with allowing him to finish his second novel, 'which he previously believed himself unable to complete.' ...Parker, and I smoked him too."
I don't know what happened.
- Parker too?
"- Yeah, so..."
- Two nemesi in one day.
- Yes.
That's pretty hot.
- I'm really proud of you.
- Thank you very much.
"I, er..."
I feel...
"No, it's insane."
- It's very hot.
- What is?
The champagne?
- You being mean.
- Oh.
Not hot when you stand like that.

You ruined it.

We have been debating this for far too long!
How old must a maid or a woman child be to enter the bonds of matrimony?
- [Men shout indistinctly] - 13!
- 12!
- 10!
- [Gavel banging] - 7!
Why even even put a number on it?
Because the federal elitists are suggesting 18.
- [Men shout indistinctly]
- No!
It's our choice!
- That's why I am proposing 16.
- No!
It's too old!
They call it lucky 7 for a reason!
Man: 14 with father's consent!

"Well, y'all oughta get some perspective."
"Why, in Uzbekistan, girls get married at the first hint of a menstrual cycle."
Ew!
"[Lowered voice] If he comes at you, punch to the throat, swift kick to the balls, okay?"
- This doesn't feel right.
- But it is right.
Your ex-wife... she haunts you.
Even she thinks this is wrong.
"Ah, you mean Monsieur Chopin."
How clever.
"It's very rare to hear him play, you know."
The Duchess d'Antan is having him for a whole fortnight at her house in Angers.
I couId only wish I were a fly on the wall.
Except that they already have crowds of files down there.
I do find the provinces beastIy.
- (applause)
- Monsieur Liszt will play next.
"- Ah, George."
I read your...
- In a minute.
George!
"You'II want to sit over here, my dear."
The respectable people are over there.
- could you point out Monsieur Chopin?
- Chopin?
But he left.
Don't you know him?
He's frail as a holy wafer.
Look at those hypocrites.
They've shunned me all evening.
I'm thrilled not to be one of them any more.
Their lives are so boring.
You see?
Every single one is throbbing for him.
They know perfectly well why I ran off with him.
For his teeth.

charles!
"Actually, I'm not sure what they do."
They just sort of gormegan from sale to sale.
"- Excuse me, Antoinette?"
- Bob.
No.
I'm Jocelyn.
"- No, you need a bob."
"- Everybody, there's been a tragedy."
Chi Chi Chemise's fainted.
- Messages?
"- No, let's go take at that."
"- ""C'est quis pas""?"
"- Perspective, Vogue just came out."
There's an article on it just like we'll have on our next issue.
- Of course there's been a leak.
- Another leak?
Can you believe it?
It's the third issue in a row this's happened.
That is no coincidence.
There must be Yuri.
"- What's a ""Yuri""?"
"- A spy, you idiot... like Mata Hari, James Bond..."
When was the last time she ate?
"She had an apple 2 days ago, she should be fine."
Just the trauma from the article?
Maybe we should take her shoes off or something.
"Oh, my God!"
- Where are my shoes?
- Here.
We should get out of here.
"Many years of pointing, you know... ballet."
"- Oh, my God!"
"Do you swear to tell the truth... the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God?"
-Yes.
-Be seated.
"-State your name, please."
-Allison MacKenzie.
"Miss MacKenzie, how long have you known Selena Cross?"
Ever since I was a child.
We went all through school together.
Miss Cross is my best friend.
"Ms. MacKenzie, you've testified that when you saw Lucas beating Selena... you thought that your presence prevented things from going further."
-I know it did.
"-You don't know, you assume."
"Well, he was embarrassed to find me watching."
How many times did Lucas hit Selena?
-Once.
-Once?
"Now, did he hit her with his fist or a weapon?"
"-Well, it was kind of a slap."
-A slap?
"Have you ever been slapped, Miss Mackenzie?"
-Yes.
-By a stranger?
-No.
-By a member of the family?
-Do I have to answer this?
"-I'm sorry, but you do."
By my mother.
As hard a blow as Selena Cross' stepfather gave her?
-No.
-How could you tell?
I don't think so.
"You don't really know what happened inside that house, do you?"
"[Carlos] Oh, Federico."
You're not Buffy La Caza Vampiros!

You're the Tlacamelli Teplani.

"Yeah, that's what people keep tellin' me."
[grunting]
[Carlos] Gonzalez...
- ... you are a man of justice.
- [groans]
"[Carlos] Yeah, a man like you understands."
"Oh, you understand that this santa sangre could keep culebras from preying on innocents."
You understand what that means?
"Less exposure for us, and more peace for you."
I'm starting to think peace is overrated.
I'm starving.
Why couldn't we stop to feed?
Because we are here for a higher purpose!
[shouting]
[Richie] What the hell is he up to?
I still don't feel right about this.
"You will, once you have the plans."
"Okay, remember, you just need to distract him while I switch out the cases."
I've got it.
"Okay, Richard?"
Relax.
[Eddie] So what is all this?
"I told you, I got about a hundred VHS tapes in here."
From Fellini to Capra.
- You want some or not?
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Put 'em over there somewhere.
Is that a big thing out here?
"Oh, yeah."
You betcha.
Folks take it real seriously -- train for months.
"Eat all sorts of wackadoo stuff, you know, like, uh..."
"Baked beans, buff wings, butter."
Butter?
Yeah.
Sometimes deep-fried.
Hm.
"This year alone, Wayne won the Butter Bowl, the Wing Ding, and Shrimptasia."
"Anyhoo, point being, Wayne McNut was the only one Slim Jim couldn't beat in the whole Great Lakes region."
So is he a suspect?
"We checked him out, but Slim Jim was in the Hot Doggery at the time of Wayne's death, and we got 15 witnesses to prove it."
Really?
Yeah.
Training.
"When I gear up for a competition, I eat lettuce -- stretches the stomach."
Yet another reason to stay away from salads.
How well did you know Wayne McNut?
"Well, well enough to know he was a weasel and a cheat."
"I hate to say it, but, uh, karma's a bitch."
This is interesting.
Mala's good-luck charms.
And Mala is...?
My old lady.
Is your old lady superstitious?
Yeah.
She's Romanichal.
Romanichal?
Gypsy.
But don't call her that.
- What is it?
- Tabasco.
I've never known Captain MacDaniel to run scared.
I'd kind of like to eyeball this situation.
Don't get killed.
I don't want anything upsetting my plans for going home.
L'll give you full cooperation.
Good night.
You didn't get a chance to give him the whole story.
L'll arrange another meeting.
MacDANIEL:
Kowalski!
Kill that light!
You better check the gun placements again.
I'm going to have a look-see.
Over there.
A heavy concentration to the south.
Let's see what Starlight-Starbright has to say.
That's a ruse.
"Kowalski, MacDaniel, pass the word."
Quietly.
Strengthen the north wall.
I repeat:
Strengthen the north wall.
Out.
KOWALSKI:
"Every third man, north wall, quietly."
"Every third man, north wall."
We had better inform the mortar crew.
- Pit one.
- Pit one.
- Pit two.
"He doesn""t have anything to say."
"You, sir, do you have anything to say on your brother""s desire to speak to me?"
- You did it!
- No!
"See, with cheating comes lying."
And lying and lying some more.
Every single lie out of your mouth does a little more damage to you.
Lunch.
"Until one day you wake up, and you don't know who you are anymore."
"Listen, I made dinner plans tonight... with Lisa."
"It""s no big deal."
"We""re just gonna go to Perry""s."
I have to set some things right with her.
"""Make amends,"" like Pastor Paul said."
"It""s only dinner, Clara."
I promise.
"You understand, don""t you?"
Yes.
I love you.
What?
I think my husband is cheating on me.
"L""m sorry to hear that, honey."
With our receptionist.
Ex-receptionist.
Lisa.
"What was her real name, Amy?"
Rebecca Singer.
"- He""s taking her out to dinner tonight."
"- Perry""s Steakhouse."
Yeah.
"Perry""s cuts their pork chops extra thick... just the way that David likes it."
I thought that maybe you could go there and spy on him.
- this is wonderful.
- Cilantro.
So what do we do?
Do we confront her?
"Oh God, no."
"Geez, I don't want to know if it's true."
What sort of attitude are we supposed to have?
Are we suppose to have an attitude?
I already have an attitude.
But it may be my mother's attitude.
I don't want to get hysterical about this.
Why shouldn't I be hysterical?
She's fifteen. I should be hysterical.
"Danlelle, lf you have on my sweats I'm going to kill you,"
Do you understand me?
- Can I taste whatever it is?
- Sure.
"- Cilantro, I love that."
- Very good.
I thought with the tomato it would sharpen it a bit-- l think it's great.
is that the fillo stuff?
Honey?
Who's Jordan?
No one.
- You mean Jordan Catalano?
- ls that his last name?
I don't know.
You brought it up.
I met Rayanne's mom tonight...
"and she was all excited about your new boyfriend, Jordan."
Boyfriend?
That's a laugh.
"When it comes to eating, you're always first."
Come on.
A little soppressata.
You even have to try the mussels 'mpepata.
Atrumpet!
We've mixed you up.
Know what they say when someone's really mixed up?
That he mistook one thing for another.
A dick for a spigot.
"It's not hard to talk like us, just take off the Iast vowel."
"For exampIe, banana becomes ""bana-n""."
"- Sofa becomes ""so-f""."
- Then it's easy.
"plate becomes ""pIa-t"", this would be ""for-k"","
"""kni-f""."
"- male, ""ma-I""."
- You wiped us out!
But these letters don't get lost.
- We neverthrow anything out.
- We recycle.
A simple vowel becomes a word.
"An ""E"" becomes affirmative."
"An ""O"" is a warning."
A guy says...
"An ""I"" means go away."
"And a ""U""?"
"The ""U"" and ""A"" are together, it's amazement."
Like when you see a beautiful woman.
You strike it lucky?
Orthe new director shows up from milan unexpectedly...
- Try ordering a dish.
"- Between us sure, but..."
I'm fed up with pinnies and vests.
They can seriously interfere with your social life.
I'll deal with you in a minute when I've f--finished shaping up this sharp fingernail.
Get on out of it!
And d--do your shirt up!
You're too short for that sort of thing!
People will mistake you for a very tall man with his flies undone!
I'm sharpening it!
I'm supposed to be b--blunting it!
-
- C--Cover your chest!
-
- I prefer to show me dangler.
You wh...
You what?
And take them g--glasses off.
You look like Secret Squirrel!
-
"- What is that thing, any road?"
-
- It's temporary till I find a proper one.
-
- Wh--What is it temporarily?
-
- It's a cocoa tin lid.
It looks all right from a distance.
"Is that what you want the world to say of your dangler? ""All right from a distance""?"
"Dear, dear!"
(CLEARS THROAT)
"Oh, Granville!"
"Hello, Julie!"
Oh!
I do not really like the sun.
Hah!
Dear friend...
I do not wish you to be burned.
(coughs)
(knocking)
Excuse me.
"I'm sorry, my friend."
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
- Where are you you?
- I wanted to urinate.
"Addons I say, without confrontation, Dave."
"Addons, however, they talk all the time."
I did everything you asked me.
I have a passport.
The identity and details.
"It's not Max, is another."
"Addons A mysterious visitor,"
Addons at stake now.
I got her passport ..
Do not touch.
Do not touch it.
They take a hell damn life.
"Addons you have demonstrated your competence in action,"
Addons but not surprising.
Strength and the description is your point.
All right.
"So ... then .. and in peace, right?"
"Addons I'm sorry, Dave."
I'm afraid I can not do that.
Addons I have an additional task for you.
"Addons I want you, to kill one of the passengers."
Addons not have much time.
Addons I offer you three minutes.
tick .. tock Addons ...
Okay.
Who would you kill?
- What happened?
- He spent more than 6 minutes.
Dave ...
"- No, no."
I've got to find a good accountant.
Hey!
I can buy a good accountant.
I can buy 20 good accountants!
I hit the jackpot!
Captain just won the lottery!
Hey.
"Next time you call me Captain, it's because you're on my boat!"
Yes!
"Oh, my goodness!"
I'm a rich man.
Everybody leaves.
- Look at this.
Natalie.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry."
I didn't know where else to go.
What happened?
Are you okay?
You haven't heard?
What?
What time is it?
5:00.
One minute after.
Turn on the news.
What...
What channel?
Any channel.
A major scandal involving the Gold Rush lottery.
"As we told you this morning, there were two winners in last night's jackpot giveaway."
"Eugene Maddox, a truck driver from Rockaway Township and Leland Stottlemeyer, a highly decorated officer with the San Francisco police."
"Now, according to the rules, these two men would split the $212 million grand prize."
"Mr. Maddox, what do you do for a living?"
"No, we gotta have a Negro."
This guy right here.
"Negro, front row."
"- Mr. Nixon, sir."
- Yeah.
We-We all knowthatyou have builtyour career... on smearing people as Communists.
"And nowyou are building your campaign on the divisions in this country, stirring up hatred and turning people against each other."
Whatthe fuck's he doing?
He's making a speech!
- Cut him off.
- I can't.
This isn't Russia.
He sounds like a negro.
He's saying all these negro things!
- What's he doing?
- He sounded white when we screened him.
He doesn'tsound white now.
He sounds like Angela Davis.
When are you going to tell us whatyou really stand for?
- Puton a commercial.
- There are no commercials.
- Go to commercial!
"- You boughtthe whole half hour, baby."
- Are you going to take offthat mask...
- Shit!
And show us who you really are?

"Little head lac, CT negative."
"Just move her to an exam room, let her sleep it off."
"And then, a la casa."
"Okay, let me know when she's set up."
Sure.
"Right this way, Glenda."
What's with the stop sign?
She's a school crossing guard.
Doesn't that make you sick?
The idea that woman is getting drunk on the job.
"Small, innocent, helpless, possibly even frail children in her charge--"
What's happening in there?
"Hey, Frank."
I think they're talking about you.
-What?
-Weaver kicking their butts is my guess.
She's gonna kick their butts if they don't stop yapping at each other.
-lsn't one gonna be the new ER chief?
-My money ain't on the nosebleed.
-The nosebleed?
"-You miss almost everything, don't you?"
"Whoa, where do you think you're going?"

-Give me that.
What are you thinking?
-He was gonna give me a tip.

-Mukendi what?

In order to have dinner tonight.
Take care well.
"Doctor, is a call for you."
Following.
It says?
"Hello, Laura."
"Yes, you tell me, you tell me."
"I assure it to you, one is the Disease of Addison."
You do not worry.
"If it is cured in time, it does not pass anything."
"You hear, is a human case."
"That poor man is counted everything to me,"
"He does not have family, not even it has Social Security."
"In agreement, agreement."
"It hears, Laura, now I have class, already you understand to me..."
"Yes, I understand."
This one case does not interest to you.
"Well, I will do that they enter position to him."
"You do not worry, I will not take to the clinic of Ciotti."
"In agreement, yes."
Goodbye.
"-God mine, I am bad."
-What happens to you?
I am bad.

Where'd you come from?
I...
He...
Where'd your crystal grapes come from?
Speak up!
Picked!
I picked them!
Nonsense!
Sure they didn't fall from the sky?
Speak up!
Where'd you pick them?
At...
At South...
At the South-hill plot?
"Nanking's 18 mounts, fleet horse on the road"
A boat sailing before the wind carried it over with great difficulty!
How about you?
So far!
"Monkey somersaulted 18,000 miles I took the grapes and lifted my heels and walked 109,200 miles!"
I still think you got them from South-hill!
I'm warning you two
Those grapes belong to Clearwater Winery!
What!
?
They have flown over the White House.
It is an unbelievable moment down here.
People are going wild.
And Emily Cale is undoubtedly a beautiful hero of the day.
Emily Cale is a little hero.
This is an unprecedented moment in U. S. history.
That search you requested came back.
"Emily, can you believe how many people have seen your video blog?"
It's not a video blog.
It's a YouTube channel.
Howmany?
Seven hundred million people.
Daughters.
Jesus!
"Oh, my God."
Are you okay?
Honest Abe.
My wife got this for me.
For the inauguration.
Are you kidding me?
You got shot in the wa..?
What I'm telling you is that good old Abe took a second bullet for me.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you did for Emily.
"It's my sacrifice, right?"
"Yes, sir."
Yep.
"John, listen."
This isn't over yet.
Walker had no prior contact..
"with any of the terrorists, but someone else did."
"Wait, wait, wait."
- Shut up!
Be normal!
"Hi, Will and Mark."
- Marcus.
"- Right, Marcus."
Come on in.

Yes.
Jesus!
This is crap.
"Can I have that back, please?"
It was a Christmas present and...
You pathetic shitface.
Give him that back or you're gonna get a slap.
Tricked ya.
Now... off before I get really cross.
Slag!
Slag!
"Why does me hitting someone make me a slag, I wonder?"
Boys are peculiar creatures.
"Not you though, Marcus."
"Well, you are peculiar but in a different kind of way."
"Are you a little slow in the head, Marcus?"
No.
I'm just funny.
- That's what everyone tells me.
"- You are a funny one though, ain't ya?"
Is it because your mum tried to top herself?
- How do you know?
"his passions, his pursuits?"
- He has a smart little pointer...
- Where is Allenham?
Nice little estate three miles east.
He is to inherit it from a relative.
Lady Allen is the name.
It's Col. Brandon.
I should go out and keep watch.
You're looking out for Willoughby.
You'll not think of Brandon now.
Come in.
"Good morning, Brandon."
- How is the invalid?
"- Thank you so much, Colonel."
Why set your cap at Willoughby when you've already made such a conquest?
I'll not set my cap at anyone.
- Lady Allen's nephew?
- He visits.
For he's to inherit.
He has a pretty estate of his own.
Combe Magna in Somerset.
I'd not give him up to a younger sister for tumbling down hills.
The man himself.
Come.
Brandon.
We know when we are not wanted.
Thank you so much for calling.
Marianne.
The colonel and Sir John are leaving.
Goodbye.
Thank you for the flowers.
"- How do you do, Colonel?"
(TRAIN RATTLES BY)
Where is Cameron?
I haven't seen Cameron for two years.
I don't know what you expect me to tell you.
"No offence, but I think you do."
"So, you were at art school together?"
Well...
I was at art school.
He'd hang around the refectory.
"Sort of, you know talking art."
LUTHER:
Did he ever talk about this?
(LAUGHS)
Spring-Heeled jack?
Yeah.
About ten zillion times.
"Yes, it was his childhood obsession."
Spring-Heeled Jack's in the cupboard.
"Spring-Heeled Jack's waiting at the bottom of the garden, in the bushes."
He had to see somebody about it.
A psychologist or a psychoanalyst.
"Anyway, they teased him about it."
It made him feel like a freak.
"I suppose he was a freak, really."
Still is.
A freaky little freak.
Did Cameron ever hurt you?
No.
- Why did you hesitate?
- Because sometimes... he'd get this look in his eyes.
What look?
Like he wanted to.
One of my tweets was:
"""Hey @Rathmines swimming pool,"

"That got 1,200 likes and 400 retweets."
"Well, let's see if Ed Sheeran is up there."
"Yes, second!"
APPLAUSE
"Yes, it's Ed Sheeran!"
"Ed Sheeran is an award-winning singer-songwriter, and national treasure."
Is there anything he can't do?
Yes.
Open a fridge without getting sunburned.
"That's it for part one, see you after the break!"
Welcome back.
We're still trying to guess the most popular Brits.
"OK, fingers on buzzers."

Is it Anthony Joshua?
The boxing legend.
"You met him recently, didn't you?"
"Yeah, I did a documentary about him."
"I met Klitschko, the person he's fighting, as well."
They're such big man and it's so...
I feel pathetic.
LAUGHTER
"No, but, like, they're 6ft 6in, but their body..."
They're just so muscly.
We're supposed to be both grown-ups.
"In fairness, he does do a lot of training."
Have a look at this.
HE GROANS
Read me what I said yesterday.
"That's not exactly the idea, Mrs. Slocum."
It's a cross-examination.
That's where they catch you if you're lying.
Shh.
Fire away.
I'll answer your questions.
"Thank you, ma'am."
Let's start with de Mario.
De Mario?
Yes.
He says that he brought Mrs. Nash home at approximately 1:45 a.m.
"Now, does that check with you?"
Check.
Do you have anything further to say about this?
No.
"And he left immediately after with you in the car, right?"
Right.
What did he talk about on the way home?
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing.
"Well, didn't he say anything when he dropped you off?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
Nothing!
"Well, he must've said something when he dropped you off, Mrs. Slocum."
"He said, ""Good night."""
"Now, look."
"De Mario has been unable to account for his time... from then until 4:00 a.m. Now, exactly what time did you get home?"
"They can't prove it, Lottie."
"Now, don't say another word until you see a lawyer."
"So, Elliott tells me you never saw the bullet coming, and that you were getting ready to paint."
"So, let's just say you were involved in a plot to blackmail the Secretary of the Navy."
"You with me, Larr?"
Is brightening up the den really the top of your priority list?
I'm pretty sure that Larr-bear here wasn't involved.
I think he just knew something that someone didn't want him telling us.
(whispers):
She's phenomenal.
But can she make assumptions like this?
"She just did, Duck."

"Yeah, Abbs."
In my lab.

That's an Unidentified Submerged Object.
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
I'm Dr. Samantha...
Ryan.
I know.
"So, what am I thinking?"
You're thinking I can't possibly know what you're thinking.
You're good.

God damn it!
Shit!
Sorry I'm late.

This matter is now in session.
The Honorable Rosten Keller presiding.
"Oh, here we go."
"The Estate of Ryan Larson, et al, versus Borns Technology."
"Parties are present, Your Honor."
Be seated.
Ahem.
This matter is here for a status hearing.
"I'm looking at the file, but I see very little progress."
I don't like that.
"Well, Your Honor, we've been conducting depositions"
- and taking testimony--
- No.
They've been doing depositions.
"In fact, from where I sit, you've done next to nothing since we last convened other than show up at my house uninvited."
"-Either I will go, or go... hopefully."
"It sees, María."
"-Yes, lady."
"And now it studies, that you have the examinations."
"yes, study, study..."
What I am going to study?
"We do something, comes."
"God, what beautiful you are..."
No.
-Why no?
-Because not and point.
If everybody does.
"Stay put, watch the film."
"-Sight, watches what it is doing to him."
-If you knew what you haríía I...
"Only would to see if still worked,"
If I worked or I endorse?
"They call Perennial Dust to me,"
"In addition, after a time between grates,"
"Then all good goes,"
"You remember lnés Badoer, its artistic name, if therefore it is possible to be said, Inés?"
To the attack!
"Alvaro, quiet."
It is possible that you only think about that?
"Yes, Yes."
Only in that.
You already know that I do not want.
"But, if we are engaged."
Indeed.
Ten patience?
no?
"Have I it, she is who does not have it."
- No.
Someone has to look after the injured.
We can't take them with us.
- All right.
"- Thank you, Mariá."
I have a question.
"Do you love this country, your homeland?"
"Yes, señor."
Have you explained that we're fighting this war for them?
"Yes, I have, señor."
So why are they staring at me as if I was a venomous snake?
They're just watching you eat because they're not going to get any food today.
Commandante!
Commandante!
What's the matter?
I've intercepted a radio message.
It wasn't even encoded.
They're going north.
So are Silveira and his militia.
- And they've requested helicopters.
- We're leaving right now.
- Get ready.
We're leaving.
- Mariá will take you to San Juan.
Helicopters!
"Oh, my God!"
"Into the jungle, everybody!"
Hurry up!
Take cover!
The helicopters are coming!
Hurry up!
Get into the jungle!
"- No, you wasn't!"
- I was!
- At all...
- Was my fault.
God... so inefficient...
Well...
Let's go!
Please enter on the collapsed tunnel.
In about 500 meters there's the place we are searching for.
"Ram, don't run."
"Male, pay attention to your steps."
Yes.
"Lieutenant, what happened?"
Don't worry.
Male stepped over a landmine.
Really?
In a place like that?
You are not scared.
Aren't you?
Leave me alone...
"Lieutenant, be careful please."
Right now a heat source has become visible.
Ok!
Let's change location.
"Everyone, listen!"
There is something lurking in the ruins at the west.
It's not like they are unarmed people.
We will take a walk before exploring underground.
Let's start the procedure as usual.
Launch the UAV.
The enemy is already moving.
Hurry!

I think we've made some sort of frontier history today.

"Well, Mother, you're a free woman."
Go and sin no more.
"Ezra, you haven't done much to gladden my heart in your life."
I'm proud to be your mother.
"Thank you, Mary."
Daddy.
All those years.
Why didn't you ever tell me?
"I tried to, son, but I couldn't."
You had enough troubles...
... withoutcarryingthisburden in your heart.
No.
That made me sound too damn noble.
Truth be told...
... Ijustdidn'thad the courage.
And I didn't want you to think bad of your mama.
She was a brave woman.
"Yes, sir. lt was."
"And all this time, I thought bad of you."
"You got consumption, don't you?"
That's why I come looking for you.

Mr. Jackson has confessed his guilt in open court.
The jury is dismissed.
We will find the way to arrive at the next embassy in Belgrade.
First we find a bathroom.
I really need to recharge the batteries.
What we need now is food.
"What's up, Louise?"
"- All right, thank you, sire."
Is the kebab good for you?
- Perfect.
His Majesty.
Good morning.
- Mr Bulut.
"Mr Moreau, I recommend eating fast."
I'm here to get you back to Istanbul.
"I'm sorry, sorry we will be grateful to accompany us to Brussels."
"Mr Moreau, let us avoid a useless scandal."
"Mr Bulut, I think she is out of his jurisdiction."
A knocking king will not prevent Turkey from entering Europe.
I understand your concerns...
"- I do not mean to lose the job,"
After thirty years of loyal service.
This does not apply to you Bulgarians.
"Back, back."

"Strength, let's go!"

Our suitcases!
"Ludovic, passports."
I have passports with me!

The Pilaf Gang's Master Plan.
Now I remember...
"Hey, Whis."
Couldn't you have got some other sides?
.
There's nothing but Planet Watrin's fried salmon... and Nebula 65's chicken in tartare sauce here.
I'm so tired of their tastes.
"How can you say you're tired of them, when I've only made you this once before, 160 years ago?"
That time when you destroyed Planet Monser.
"If I'm tired of them, I'm tired of them."
"Either way, you had better finish your food quickly, Beerus-sama."
We'll be arriving at the north Kaio's planet in about 10 minutes.
"Oh, really?"
Why...?
Why is Beerus-sama's ki headed for this planet...?
"Oh, I can't take it."
He'll be here any moment.
"What're ya doin', Kaio-sama?"
G-G-Goku.
Y-You're still here?
"Didn't you say that ""Bulma"" friend of yours was having a birthday party?"
"Well, you know, I ain't too great at dealing' with parties..."
Y-You're going to lose friends with that attitude.
"You've been actin' weird for a while, Kaio-sama, so I've been wonderin' why."
I've been acting weird?
.
Huh?
I'm weird.
I'm weird.
I'm going crazy.
I'm weird.
"He's a genius, right?"
And you're his partner.
Partner/ babysitter/assistant/ babysitter.
- What's your name?
- Natalie Teeger.
"Ms. Teeger,"
"I know this probably sounds callous, but have you ever done any acting?"
Me?
- No!
"- Well, here's my problem."
"We've got another show tomorrow night, and"
"I know it's terrible timing, but we need someone to pick the numbers."
You mean on Tv?
I think you're a natural.
"- No, I don't think so."
- Here you go.
I was just talking to his nephew on the phone.
He couldn't even believe it was really me.
Felt like felt like fats Domino.
"Mr. Monk, this is Mr. Lawrence."
He's the station manager.
He just asked me to be the new Lotto girl.
Only for one night.
We can hold a regular audition over the weekend.
What do you think?
I don't know.
What do you think?
- I think it sounds like fun.
"- I know, but here's the thing."
Tomorrow is... wednesday.
- We already made plans.
- What plans?
"Well, it's impolite to kiss and tell."

"- Where's Stewart been, Katy?"
- He's not talking to me.
- Why?
- I don't know.
"Here are your birthday pancakes, big brother."
Don't fuck with tradition.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
BOTH:
"Happy birthday, Wayne."
Jinx.
You owe me a Coke.
"Well, see now, that you can get in the States."
"What you can't get, though, is Crush Cream Soda."
- BOTH:
"We got you a present, Wayne."
- Two Cokes.
We don't make a thing of birthdays in this family.
Can we skip my super-soft birthday party then this year?
Hard no!
"It's not a birthday thing, it's an efficiency thing."
"Uh, if you can be one thing, you should be efficient."
We got you an appointment with a matchmaker.
Get the...
Take a...
"Well, start walkin'."
"Well, you won't do online dating."
"There's no more MoDeans, so you can't meet girls there."
"You're handcuffed, cowboy."
Why do not you make yourself room.
I'm exhausted.
No heart!
DEATH ...
Book of death?
How to use it .
This is English.
The person whose name is written in the notebook dies
This works if has the face of the person in mind.
This is ineffective on people of the same name and surname.
The cause of death must be written within 40 seconds for that to happen.
Cardiac arrest is systematic absence of cause.
Very fun.
Ouch!
I will not let go .
I would have preferred it to disappear
Ridiculous.
- This is his?
- Yes.
"Yagami, you know some Sakota?"
- Yes.
- Mr. Yagami Light.
Yes.
I checked the content and it's your mobile phone.
He was in his jacket pocket.
Uh...
He reportedly died.
Died?
Water boils!
Last night 23 to 30 h at a motorcycle race he crashed into the barriers a crossing.
He died instantly.
You know him?
"If you don't understand, I'm not going to explain."
- More?
- Why not?
Your father said to give you a big sendoff.
"Rodney, will I ever see you again?"
Can I compete with those Boston girls?
What are your qualifications?
- Can't you guess?
- Seeing is believing.
I think you're 10 percent man and 90 percent talk.
You're 100 percent woman.
Two hundred and fifty percent woman.
Maybe 500.
Going to take more than money to keep me.
Know what you're doing to my temperature?
- Let's cool it off and go for a swim.
- But we didn't bring any bathing suits.
"- You all ready, Norman?"
- Yeah.
Forgot my cap.
What did you say?
"Norman, you're making me blush all over."
I'm sorry.
Let's go in swimming.
What did you whistle for?
"I saw a fellow and a girl swimming, without a stitch on."
- Where?
- They're gone now.
They got out of the water and ran into the woods.
- Naked?
- Naked.
It was Allison MacKenzie and Norman Page.
"You married up, Son."
Everyone knows you married up.
"My son has committed a terrible sin... against you, Clara, and you, Amy."
Against those innocent little boys.
Against his own mother and father.
"And against the Lord, our God."
If God can forgive us... then we should forgive the mistakes of our loved ones.
"And it was a mistake, David."
"A thoughtless, self-centered mistake... of a weak man."
"You can do better, Son."
We all know you can do better.
I forgive you.
"She forgives you, Son."
Clara forgives you.
And I forgive you.
"- Thank you again for supper, Clara."
- It was lovely.
I think those Colombian meatballs are my favorite.
"First thing tomorrow, you have to fire that home wrecker."
"- You haven""t fired her yet?"
"- This isn""t Lisa""s fault."
- She has three children and no way...
- Daddy.
Please.
"It""s dark."
You forgot to turn on my nightlight.
Look at this boy.
March right down there.
Yes!
- Buddy.
"- Come here, honey."
Thank you for coming.
"My company keeps a suite here all year round, in case of emergency."
Keeps a suite here?
"Pretty big outfit, huh?"
TUBBY:
"Yeah, it's his outfit-- Rutlege Cotton Mills."
-Cotton mills?
-Yeah.
"Well, hey, Tubb, you can shack up with me here."
You don't have to rent a room.
"Well, I got my own apartment right around the corner on Park Avenue."
-Park Avenue?
-Yeah.
Where else would a Park Avenue doctor live?
-Doctor?
-Yeah.
"Why, this poor soul couldn't open a can of rations without cutting his finger."
"Doctor, huh?"
Good boy.
"What are you doing, Bissel?"
Insurance.
Door-to-door?
"No, he's chairman of the board."
Chairman?
It figures.
"Say, you guys are doing all right."
(all chattering at once)
MORGAN:
"Now, Bilk, we have to..."
"You know, Bilk, it takes a lot of angling and finagling to make a success of yourself in the world today."
"Of course, we spent three years training under you-- the master."
Master?
How'd you find out I was a master?
Your things just flew out the window.
What?
You're part of the scenery.
"The air passes through, filling your entire body."
It flows out your finger tips.
Breathe with your toes to get the air into your toes.
The energy flowing in your toes fills you with vitality.
Your toes are laughing.
Good.
You're like air.
A cool breeze permeates your body.
You see a vision of divine beauty.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Who did this?
The Freemasons?
Are you from a bat lodge or something?
Leave me alone.
"Guys, I need help!"
Don't touch her!
"There's some wacko here, Peku!"
Are you fucking crazy or what?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Somebody was crying for help.
"The bride was tied up, her clothes all torn."
"I tried to help, but the Devil and Dracula attacked me."
Then they all just disappeared.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."

- Eddie.
Search him!

That is like the weirdest thing that ever happened at this school.
Ever.
J ust think about who...
if we all weren't in our classrooms just minding our own business.
And look.
By what.
I could have been right at that spot.
I was there like ten minutes earlier.
What is the big deal?
It's not like anybody even got a flesh wound.
You knew the whole time!
"All of you, you're all a bunch of idiots!"
"Jimmy, we've lost the war."
Women and children will suffer more than anyone.
You're pigs!
A country full of pigs!
- And what about you?
- Shut your mouth!
You go into homes certain you can... buy everything with chocolate and cigarettes.
I loved her.
You loved her?
So what's stopping you?
You're a pig!
A pig from Cleveland!
I wanted to marry her!
Isn't that her man?

At least I haven't forgotten to wear it until now.

You're one hour early.

"Yes, I'm coming."

"Just like this, a guy came to help."
The penalty I paid for it is 20 lakh rupees.
To whom did you give?
Inspector Arivazhagan.
What do you mean?
!
That who he said he was.
"Last week, my girlfriend Ashwini and I had gone for a drive."
Go away.
Just one kiss like this.
Fraudster!
What do you call this then?
This was just a rehearsal.
"Suddenly, she thought she saw someone standing on the road and she swerved the car away in one quick movement."
Ashwini!
What happened?
Ashwini!
Ashwini!
Where are you?
What happened?
What happened?
"I killed a guy, Manoj."
"Come, Ashwini."
Let's go.
I convinced her somehow and got her home.
All this happened because... some idiot had placed a scarecrow in the middle of the road.
I consoled her that it was not her fault.
But she kept crying.
We couldn't sleep out of fear.
The calling ball rang at 5 AM.
"Who is it, Ashwini?"
At this time?
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop!"
"Stop, stop, stop, stop!"
"No, don't, don't!"
Don't!
Don't!
Stop!
Stop!
No!
"Oh, fuck."
That was one second.
Either he's super susceptible to this or the software is way too powerful still.
It's jumped from zero to 18K in five milliseconds...

Mum?
I have to call him.
Mum?
Why did Cooper go?
- I...
"- Mom, I'm right here."
I'm...
"- I'm right here, Mum."
- I have to call Cooper.
I have to call and make sure that he's safe.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
I have to call him.
- Yeah.
- The end.
And the last.
- Anyone wanna talk about auditioning?
"- Oh, God."
"Oh, yeah."
"Remember, there was that huge to-do about my hair and my makeup and all that stuff on my last audition."
"Remember, Pete?"
Remem...?
Somebody went...
Did you go shopping for clothes?
- I went shopping for clothes.
- You brought options.
- I bought 800...
- That was the first time we met.
- That's right.
- We read together.
"Pete and Kerry Kohansky gave me pointers and really helped me out, you know."
Was this something I shouldn't talk about?
Never mind.
- That was all a lie.
- We should talk about...
Let's rewind and...
"Wait, seriously, should we go redo that?"
"No, it's okay."
"Oh, shit."
"Should we talk about that today is September 24th, 2008?"
- It's one week till the premiere.
- What's today?
"One week from the premiere, today."
- We have one week till the premiere.
- That's exciting.
You're scaring me.
So..?
"Dear, I don't feel a thing."
Wait.
This is the danger.
The effect kicks in when you least expect it.
"You know, I'm discovering the US."
What surprising people.
They're clean and crystalline...
They believe that Christ is always on the side of the winner.
- May I say something?
- Yes.
I'm starting to feel the effect.
Are you joking?
- Is it strong?
"- Yes, I can't take it anymore."
"It's been so long, Curzio!"
You're the only person that calls me Curzio.
"Careful, she's looking this way."
Is she crazy?
My god!
"- My god, that woman is crazy!"
- She's nothing but trouble!
Don't tell me she flew that plane all the way from Washington.
"Sicíly, but I don't doubt she'd manage it."
She had her wings before she sprouted tits.
- Maam...
- Thank you.
"I'm General Howes, representantive of General Cork..."
"Major Beckwith, General Cork's assistant."
"The General would love to be here personally, maam, but duty calls."
At least someone's fighting the war.
"Ken, the kiosk man. """
Amazing.
Too bad this guy didn't run a hot-dog stand.
I'm here for allergies.
These things are pushing me over the edge.
Can you get rid of them?
Or give them to someone a little more deserving.
Who saved flower boy's foot and moved more patients than anybody today?
"Me, that's who."
"You' re gonna miss me too, because I'm out of here."
"- Banker's hours, Pratt?"
- Only if they work doubles.
"Hey, Carter."
What's up with your boss?
Is it true she was crying earlier?
- Weaver?
- Yeah.
Bad breakup or something?
- Been pretty moody lately.
- Lately?
I'm sorry!
I think this man needs immediate attention!
- You gotta help my pops!
- What happened?
They came in the ambulance entrance.
- I saw he was diaphoretic.
- Not asking you.
We were playing ball.
He grabbed his chest.
- When did the pain start?
- An hour ago.
- Thought it would go away!
He was an exciting guy.
He was really nice.
He introduced me to everybody.
Everybody wanted to be nice to him.
And he knew how to handle it.
Don't buy wigs that come off at the wrong time.
Morrie's wigs don't come off!
Even underwater.
"And remember, Morrie's wigs are tested against hurricane winds."
"So, forget about money."
You can afford a Morrie wig.
Prices to fit every budget.
So call me now!
And come in for a personalized fitting.
"Morrie, Jimmy's waiting."
You're past due.
I've been good to you.
But there's something quite unreasonable going on here.
Jimmy's being an unconscionable ball breaker.
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.
I never had to pay the vigorish that he demands.
"What am I, a schmuck on wheels?"
"Please, you know Jimmy."
You borrowed his money.
Pay him.
I didn't agree to three points above the vig.
What are you going to do?
Going to fight with Jimmy Conway?
He wants his money.
Give him his money and let us just get the fuck outta here!
Hey...
Fuck him!
BRENNAN:
Oh...
This is blood.
Aldo's?
"We can't be completely sure, there are tests..."
"Look at that, Bones."
Look.
That's the cage.

Cam will want to do blood spatter analysis as soon as possible.

Bones.
I need to finish...
"No, look."
Look!
"Booth, that's a bomb!"
BOOTH:
"We got to go, now."
(grunting)
(gasping)
(Brennan groaning)
Crews are still battling the blaze at an abandoned office complex in Anacostia.
"The cause of the fire is undetermined, but fire marshals suspect the strong possibility of arson."
Booth says it was an IED.
"Yeah, but do IEDs usually take this long to burn off?"
HODGINS:
"No, Booth saw Jerry Cans of gas."
My hunch is it was powered by a petroleum gel.
"It sticks to everything and burns at over 2,000 degrees."
Which means there won't be much left.
Close to zilch.
"Whoa, Dr. B."
It will.
So I suggest you keep the Vorpal sword on hand when the Frabjous Day arrives.
You seem so real.

I've always admired that hat.
"Hello, Chess."
"Since you won't be needing it anymore, would you consider bequeathing it to me?"
How dare you?
It is a formal execution.
"I would like to look my best, you know."
It is a pity about all this.
I was looking forward to seeing you Futterwacken.
"I was rather good at it, was I not?"
I really do love that hat.
I would wear it to all the finest occasions.
"I love a morning execution, don't you?"
"-Yes, Your Majesty."

"We went swimming, but we had our suits on."
"And by now, everybody in Peyton Place knows about it."
If anything is wrong with her...
"We didn't do anything, did we, Allison?"
- No.
- You better take your boy and go.
We didn't do anything.
"I've never, never been so humiliated and disgusted!"
Allison!
Come back here immediately!
Keep this up and I'll do what you accuse me of!
-l hate that it had to turn out this way.
-(siren wailing)
"Me taking care of the girl, me taking care of the police."
"What you need, what we're willing to offer, is a change of pace."
We have a station for you to look after.
Blackleg Miner.
One of the smaller terminals.
-England?
-Yeah.
"Far the fuck out, middle of nowhere."
Old American Army base.
Officially it doesn't exist.
"Unofficially, it's used to broadcast numbers to our European field agents."
-How long?
-Until your head is right.
You'll be babysitting a broadcaster.
"Civilian, right?"
"Yeah, cryptology specialist."
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level.
"You and another team, alternating shifts."
Three days each.
"You keep the station safe, you keep the code safe."
Whatever it takes.
Okay.
"Do the job, Emerson."
I don't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one.

katherine:
That's enough!
You've already said that over 30 times today.
Dinner is served!
What family education!
Grabbing the bigger piece.
How were you taught?
Always to take the smaller piece!
You got what your mother told you to get!
Couldn't find the Formula.
But I found this.
"On April 14, 7:00 p.m., the Emperor's godson, Hiroshima Tora,"
The Emperor's godson!
Will pick up the 'Beast' posing as Special Envoy from Chungking.
You want to know what he looks like?
Looks just like you!
What a coincidence!
You know what to do then?
You want me to pose as him?
Right!
What if the real thing turns up?
- He wouldn't.
- How come?
"Tomorrow, we'll get on the train 1 station ahead... ls it the right person?"
Why don't you ask himself?
Are you Hiroshima Tora?
People with hearing aids are usually deaf.
"From my past experience, he doesn't look the part."
Let's go to the other cabin.
It's him!
"Kidoo, get a bigger hammer!"
We haven't worked so well together for ages.
Who's he?
Get down now!
- Get on the floor now!
- Get in there!
Get him down!
I need an ambulance in here!
Get me an ambulance!
"- Come on, Todd, come on!"
- What happened?
"I don't know, one minute he was fine, then he started convulsing and he fell over."
"Come on, kid."
Come on!
He's dead.
"Don, he's dead."
CSI:
NY Season05 Episode13 Rush to Judgment
I was questioning him.
"He was getting agitated, then he started talking azy."
Then he started shaking.
Foam was coming out of his mouth and he hit the ground.
Don't worry.
Sid will get to the bottom of it.
Detective Flack.
- You mind answering a few questions?
- No problem.
"Don, don't you want to wait for a union rep?"
"No, no, no, no."
I'd rather take care of this now.
"Okay, you can start by filling out this incident report."
When did you first encounter Mr. Fleming?
Earlier today.
He was at wrestling practice over at Hillridge High School.
Detective Angell and I went by and asked him to come downtown with us.
Everything's the same as when Golly was here.
It looks the same... it smells the same... but there's this tiny hole inside me that wasn't there before.
It's like... like a splinter in your finger... only this one's right above my stomach.
"Harriet, are you okay?"
Uh-huh.
Something's... different.
No cats?
How can Harrison Withers not have a billion cats around?
They finally nailed him.
I will always remember that face.
That's the face you make when you really lose something.
"Uh-oh, Frankie took the truck."
Speak English!
"Oh, okay, you want us to speak English, huh?"
!
"Well, you are a jerk, huh?"
"I tell you, ""Don't take the truck."
"You smash the truck."""
"Well, you tell me now,"
"Mr. Wise Guy, was one date worth it?"
...we have people here shopping!
Yeah.
"Hey, all right, Grandpa."
"It's cool, right?"
"It wasn't a big deal, huh?"
"I knew you'd understand, right?"
Sometimes I think families everywhere are exactly the same.
Everybody get back to work.
"Mom, Dad, please?"
Grandpa!
Just calm down.
Too exciting.
"-You know, I should probably go."
"-Oh, come on, Golan."
How often do you get a night and a morning off?
-I'd stay for another.
-Okay.
--and the emotional response to love  is usually the result of a show of affection or favour.
"-Tom, can I use your phone?"
"-Yeah, it's right over there."
-I think we'd do really well together.
-Absolutely.
For a while.
"God, will you get past the cynicism?"
"I just broke up with somebody, baby."
I thought you forgot all about him.
Hello?
Al?
-Who are you with?
-Just some of the residents.
"I'd like to leave, but Sara's driving, and I don't want to be rude."
You want to come down?
No.
I'll see you when you get home.
All right.
You're ageist.
-That's what it is.
"-Oh, please."
Then what are you afraid of?
Breaking your heart.
"Running your ass into the ground, buddy."
Bollocks.
Why do you want to ruin this with domesticity?
"Because I've never met a braver woman and I'm deeply, deeply attached to you."
"I heard a noise, just checking..."
"It's getting colder, wear an undershirt."
There are no cleaning materials left...
Dad?
Tie up yourhair.
Take care of yoursister.
"No, I still have things to take care of here."
"Kezban, enough!"
"Watch out, this could be the end of us."
"Don't worry, Dad."
This is yourfinal year anyway.
"Just finish school, do your military service, and come back home."
"Business is bad, I need help."
There is a teaching position in college here.
See?
He is lusting aftersinful gains.
"Don't keep us waiting, son."
Business is really bad.
"You don't say, dad."
Do you want me to go bankrupt?
"I can't breath without you, son."
I could've driven you.
No need.
You take care of yourhomework.
May God protect you from the evil eye.
"Finally, the nightmare is over."
They wouldn't even leave your corpse behind in Istanbul...
Damn.
My hands stink of bleach.
C'mon I'll drop you off at school.
And where you off to?
"- Misty, moisty, morning, full of birds..."
Looking at this scarf.
It's got my blood stains on it.
The man who shot me wrapped it over my eyes.
I'll never forget that.
- Would you like some tea?
"- No, thanks."
It won't take a minute.
"Please, sit."
I'll put some music on.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night of desolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep
Who needs dreams...
Relax!
"You look exactly like what you are, an undercover agent."
"Lighten up, or it'll be an open secret."
Come on.
Smile!
Now you look like something out ofa nuthouse.
"Chang, this guy Eddie's a lunatic."
Be careful.
"Same to you, pal."
Watch your ass!
"Eddie, sorry to keep you waiting."
- Who the hell is that?
- He's a good buddy.
- Say hello to Eddie.
He will notice
Where 's your corset?
- And no stockings.
- I'm against them.
But you are not properly dressed
"Who is to say what is ""proper""?"
"What if it was agreed that ""proper""was wearing a codfish on your head, would you wear it?"
Alice ...
"For me, a corset is like a codfish"
"Please, not today."
Father would have laughed.
I'm sorry.
I'm tired.
I didn't sleep well last night.
Did you have bad dreams again?
Only one.
"It's always the same, ever since I can remember"
Do you think that's normal?
Don't most people have different dreams?
I don't know.
There.
You're beautiful.
"Now, can you manage to smile?"
At last.
We thought you'd never arrive
"Alice, Hamish is waiting to dance with you ."
Go.
You do realize it's well past 4?
Now everything I've been rushed through
- I am sorry.
"- Oh, nevermind."
Forgive my wife.
Finished measuring?
Anything else?
Choose the material.
I'll take the one in your hand.
Cloth-cutting.
"Murderous tailor, I've guessed your real game."
I've done nothing to offend you.
Why do you want me dead?
Sifu Tam is angry with you.
Taking revenge is a poor way to solve the problem.
Please pass on this message to Sifu Tam.
I want to be friends with him.
- Foon.
"- Yes, Sifu?"
- Get him a new pair of scissors.
- Yes.
Still dirty.
"Scrub, scrub, scrub!"
"More money, more money..."
Ruined another one.
Help!
"Get a grip, you coward!"
"Sister, it's you!"
I thought it was that painted face!
Nothing to worry about.
You were born without courage.
Why are you afraid of a painted face?
- I nearly died from the shock.
- Go and dry the clothes!
Give me a minute to recover.
"I told you before, you only use two fingers to squeeze."
Why do I have to squeeze with two fingers?
"Oh, hey, Marissa, I was really sorry to read about your stepdad in the paper today."
- You read the paper?
"- Just the L.A. Times, the New York Times, the Orange County Register and The Wall Street Journal."
"This relationship is probably over now, right?"
I'll just go.
"No, no, no."
Stay.
"Um, actually, we were just talking, and um..."
What are you doing this weekend?
You got to be kidding me.
"I know, I know."
"I'm sorry, but it's the only seat left."
"- Don't worry, I promise I'll keep my hands to myself."
"- Well, it's your elbow I'm worried about."
- Why do you hate me so much?
"- No, I don't;"
I'm sorry.
- What did I do?
- It was an accident.
"- No, it was like four accidents."
"- Six, if you count each individual tampon."
- I don't know what else you want me to say.
- Nothing.
"In fact, we never need to speak to each other again."
"- Yeah, see, but I was really enjoying getting to know you."
"- Well, I wasn't."
- I was being sarcastic.
- I wasn't.
"Morning, guys."
"Your favorite physics teacher here, R.E. Greenberg, with your new lab partner assignments."
We've got Adrianna Alberghetti with Philip Raskin.
Ryan Atwood with Lindsay Gardner.
"Don't worry your pretty, little head about that."
Pretty?
"While Hayley and I distract Austin, you need to look for this."
It's a false wall.
A secret room.
That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.
Exactly.
"Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer,"
I get equal credit.
No double-crosses.
Deal.
"That way, Mason Wood has to make both of us members of the society."
Let's go.
Hold on.
Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.
- No.
Deciding between something I brought and something that Rick's about to buy me.
I think I know the direction you'll be leaning in.
Oh.
You really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.
Austin:
Wow.
"Come in, come in."
Let's get some drinks in you.
Ooh.
Here you go.
Ooh.
A little something to loosen your inhibitions.
"Oh, don't worry."
We're plenty loose already.
Not after I've tied you up.
And photo session is going on...
Model or their skeleton!
Look like they got sick by wearing out undergarments.
Who will buy our undergarments?
We'll have to wear them all.
"Underwear is okay, but who's going to wear the bra?"
Your father.
Dad please don't use your words.
What is happening?
"Uncle Shakespeare said, What is in the name?"
But he forgot...
What if three people share the same name?

Diamond is worth 20 crores and route is by road.

Really?

I bet you'd make a great photographer.
Home sweet home.
"I really had a great time, Jocelyn."
"Anytime Resin is indisposed, I'll be your walking partner."
"Tomorrow will be a rough day, I've been assigned to..."
Skirt's security task force to find the Yuri.
- Sounds very gums.
- It really bothers me.
All this fashion espionage.
Someone just takes our hard work... and hand it over to Vogue.
It really pisses me off!
I'm going to make it my mission to aprehend Yuri.
"If anyone can do that, you can."
A spy's work is never done.
"Right, I really enjoyed that walk."
"Good night, Jocelyn."
Sweet dreams.
"- I'm sorry, Jocelyn."
- No big deal.
"Quick, quick, quick!"
I need my comb!
"Fabulous, fabulous!"
"That, wonderful."
This is the best session!
"Come on, ladies!"

Embrace it!
Make love to it!
"Let the water wash away your sins, ladies!"

"Vetoes to the excrement, you joke but there is something does not fit."
Clear that there is something does not fit.
"Lella is with you because your parents have money, have the bar."
"It is not truth, Lella is a good girl."
"In addition it does not matter, I want to me to Lella."
Heavy what with that Lella.
"In short, what you need she is a woman."
You love a woman for tonight?
"Yes, Yes."
We provided to him a woman for tonight?
"Yes, proporciónamela I want it, please."

Me no.

"Just where on this island is the treasure supposed to be, anyway?"
.
It says right here on the map.
"It was an entire 50 zeny, so search properly."
Who would believe such a cruddy map?
The same goes for that boat.
"Thanks to you skimping out, the engine broke."
"Now we can't even get back to the port, can we?"
.
How could you?
.
Am I going to die here...?
Just stop complaining and get searching for the treasure.
I'm so hungry...
I want some dinner pancakes...
"And if I can't even catch one small fry, are you telling me that even the fish are disrespecting King Pilaf?"

Aren't they great?
Mum's been collecting them specifically for today.
The seven Dragon Balls are all together...
And they're headed this way.
N-No way...

S-Stop.
Our dinner....
Oww...
Who cares about such cheap crap?
- You missed a great party!
Everybody was there.
I could have stayed all night...
But Paul forgot his stupid disk and we had to come...
- all the way back uptown.
- Bummer.
We won't keep you from your work...
I'm sure it's very important.
"Come on, Paul, I wanna go home."
"Jocelyn, don't work too late, will you?"
You are pathetic!
What a disgrace!
- You're fired.
- You are over!
What are you doing?
"You are stupid, you're a bad person!"
You fool.
You ashamed Skirt and you're never ever gonna work here again.

Is this a meeting about something new?
Hmm?
"Well, potentially."
It's complicated.
We're hoping for some money from a sale of movie rights.
Is that woman still your editor?
No.
She's an asshole with no loyalty as well.
- What about...
- Are you here only to put me on the spot?
None of this is worth revisiting to me.
I've been betrayed by a lot of small-minded and worthless people.
Do I need them to accomplish anything?
"- Yeah, seriously, Ted."
Pretending to be someone else just to get laid... that's...
Embarrassing.
- Your Highness.
- Let's go.
Oh.
Ew.
"Marshall, take that off."
- What?
I think it looks kind of cool.
- Cool?
You look like one of those jerks who's in some lame band... and rides a motorcycle without a helmet... and has a wallet chain and neck tattoos and a drug problem.
"Not a... a big one, just, uh, enough that he deals a little bit on the side."
"And he can never, ever be true to one woman."
Finish that damn pickle and do me!
"Okay, you guys know how my mornings usually go."
- Why would we care how...
"- Usually, it's like this."
- After you.
- Oh.
Thank you.

Emily pledged her loyalty to Katherine.
But she couldn't stand by and watch innocent people get killed.
This was the only way she could think of to help to let Johnathan Gilbert believe he'd actually invented these devices.
Does it say what it does?
- Are you sure this is what Isobel wants?
"- Yeah, I'm sure."
Why?
This is a weapon.
Against vampires.
Elena.
Hey.
Um...
Have you seen Stefan?
I need to find him.
"No, not lately."
"Listen, do you have a second?"
"- Yeah, what's up?"
What's going on?
"- Well, it's Anna."
I've left her all these messages and she hasn't gotten back to me.
- Not even a text.
- Anna?
I didn't know that you guys were still friends.
"Yeah, we're more than friends."
"Look, something could be seriously wrong."
"And if you know anything, you gotta tell me."
"I haven't talked to her, Jer."
Are you lying to me right now?
- Why would you say that?
- That's what you do.
You lie.
You lie about everything.
I'm picking entire bloody structure either.
"Could you get from the high over there, please?"
Of course the irony is... they've given this to a bloody documentaries director.
He won't want any dialog anyway.
It will all be fishing nets and local kids playing football.
You wait.
"What if, it's not what the American does that makes us put our work?"
It's what he doesn't do.
He falls for those.
He doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.
Self sacrifice.
That's noble.
Only if he stands a chance?
Maybe he does.
Maybe she likes him because he is the sort who let her fix the propeller.
"So give him a name ""Margenes""."
Joe.
Hard boiled types only have last names.
Buckley.
Taken.
Now what were you before you became Cole?
Catrin Pule.
Kathrine?
Catrin's the Welsh version.
It was his idea.
A beautiful Welsh girl deserves a beautiful Welsh name.
Where would you've drawn the line?
Cardiff Cole.
Caffeine Cole.
Coalmine Cole.
Hey!
?
"Come on, then."
You know I didn't mean it.
You can go.
"All sorted, Sir H."
Ready to record when you are.
"Thank you, Lionel."
Now.
This... hears everything and forgives nothing.
It is a cruel mistress.
We can have no mistakes.
Perfection only will do.
"Complete clarity, total concentration!"
"And of course, a lovely, happy sound."
"Pauline, go and phone the coffee order through."
Right.
What was I supposed to say?
"Yeah, you're right, fatso, we have it away every Tuesday?"
Bloody idiot.
Is he a drinker?
Huh.
You don't want to bother with him.
I do want to bother with him.
Pauline!
Do you want this hand cream?
Atrixo?
"Lovely, thanks."
"No, don't be like that, Enid."
"Honestly, in bed, between you and Moira, well, no contest."
"You might want to switch off the intercom, Malcolm."
Oh...
"Oh, good."
A critique on my sex life has gone through to everyone in planning.
-So of course you'll take it.
-I have a week to make up my mind.
Sit down.
-Michael.
-Yes?
You were right.
I never thought I could say it but you were right.
-About what?
"During the past months, I've been able to come to a few conclusions about myself."
-And what were they?
"Well, Michael, I've lied for so long."
"I was everything you said, specially that night in the kitchen."
I wanted you more than you could've never wanted me.
-I had no right to say those things.
"-Yes, you did."
-And I'm here to tell you the truth.
-You don't owe me explanations.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide... but because she hated me.
She won't answer my letters or phone calls.
Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
-She told me Allison and Norman...
-I know about the phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"And, without thinking, when Allison returned I told her some terrible things."
-What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"There's lore about spirits possessing people, riding them."
"Whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative, well, that's super."
[EMF METER WHINING]
SAM:
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here ghosty, ghosty, ghosty."
"-Come out, come out, wherever you are."
-I don't get it.
No one ever died on this bus.
It's not like there's a body here.
"But a flap of skin, a hair-- Hell, a hangnail--"
Something's gotta be tying the ghost to this place.
We gotta find it.
SAM:
Yeah.
"Got a new driving permit, issued two weeks ago."
[CLICKS OFF EMF METER]
-Just before the first attack.
-Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk MacGregor Sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
-MacGregor?
-Yeah.
What?
I knew his son.
- Never.
- What else did she say?
- That he was nice to her.
That he helped her get over Quini.
Thank you.
"Bye, buddy."
Goodbye.
His name is Sebastian Rovira Galvez.
He doesn't work at the hotel anymore.
He got fired.
They still have some of his things there.
We need to get them.
MOTHER WITH FRIEND
TOMORROW AT 7:30 AT THE CROSS.
GO ALONE.
The photos of the girls were taken with a roll like that one.
- Only one place sells them.
- Where?
Where are my photos?
- I don't have them yet.
- And what do you have?
"Aguila Photography, in Seville."
Someone places a prepaid order every month.
- Who?
- A good-looking guy named Quino or Quini.
"They develop them there too, but they wouldn't tell me about them."
But definitely not communion photos.
I think there's someone else there.
You can see the reflection of whoever took the photo.
He's blurred by the flash.
Tell me who he is and you'll get your photos.
"All right, but I'll need the negative."
Humanity would live... once again.
The end
Mmm...
Mmm...
"You gotta wrap it up, Teddy."
"We're closing for the afternoon, but we'll be back in a few hours for the dinner rush."
I'm ready!
Let's go!
- Why do you have two bottles of wine?
- What?
It's a wine train.
Ooh.
You guys going on the wine train?
"Uh, you get the wine on the train, Lin."
You don't have to bring it.
Oh...
"Otherwise, it would be just called a train."
Right.
"Lin, you're sure kids are allowed on this thing?"
"It says right here in the brochure, ""Kids are allowed."""
"It says, ""Kids are allowed, ""but not welcome."""
Like in the health and sexuality section at the bookstore.
- Where's Gene?
- He's picking out his outfit.
I'm gonna be Boxcar Gene!
"Gene, why do you look like Dexy from Dexy's Midnight Runners?"
- 'Cause we're going on a train!
"- Well, go put a shirt on."
"Next thing, you're gonna be telling me to go put on underwear."
Put on underwear.
Okay.
Do not desire it.
Miss Dashwood.
Col. Brandon's lawn is perfect for kite launching.
Mind the pretty ribbons.
Imagine my surprise when Charlotte and her master appeared with Lucy.
The last person I expected to see.
She came to join in the fun.
There is no such luxury at home.
I'd not seen you for so long.
You sly thing!
It was the Dashwoods she wanted to see.
"I've heard nothing but ""Dashwood"" for I don't know how long."
What do you think of them?
My mother wrote of little else in her letters.
- Are they not as she described?
- Nothing like.
You are quite rude today.
He's to be an MP.
And he is forced to make everybody like him.
- I said nothing so irrational.
- Mr. Palmer's so droll.
Here he comes!
"Now you shall see, Charlotte."
"Hello, Mr. Willoughby!"
"You must meet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr. Palmer."
"- And our cousin, Miss Lucy Steele."
- Welcome to our party.
May I sit beside you?
I've longed to meet you.
I've heard nothing but praise for you.
Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are too excessive in their compliments.
The praise came from another source.
Thanks for the wallet.
Dr. Roncero.
Psychiatrist.
7th Left.
Twenty three.
The day I spent waiting at the window was the day she wouldn't come.
But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr. Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
Can't it be sooner?
"No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?
I've got an appointment at 5:00.
Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
Benigno Martin?
Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"The last fifteen years, you said?"
Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, makeup and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's makeup and her hair?
"Right, so, I failed to mention that the giant enchanted the beanstalk to repel intruders."
"All right, so how do we get up there?"
"I've got a counter spell from Cora, if you'd be so kind."
"Thank you, my lady."
(TINKLING)
I've got one more of these.
Cora was to accompany me.
"So, which one of you four lovelies shall take her place?"
"Go on, fight it out."
"And don't be afraid to, you know, really get into it."
(CAR HORNS IN THE DISTANCE)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
(CAR HORN HONKS)
(DOOR SQUEAKS)
(CLANKS)
(ENGINE STARTS)
- Impressive.
- (GASPS)
"But really, you could've just asked me for the keys."
Just drive.
It's fine.
I just stole your car.
Your life could be in danger.
Neal Cassidy.
"Yeah, I'm not telling you my name."
I don't need it to have you arrested when the robbery is in progress.
Emma Swan.
Good name.
"So, do you just live in here, or are you just waiting for the car to be stolen?"
Why don't I tell you over drinks?
Excuse me?
"- Hey, eyes on the road!"
This is a dream come true.
That's very kind of you to say.
"Our society has a long and rich history, and our membership expands every continent, save Antarctica."
Not too many murders there.
No.
No. [Chuckles]
"Although, I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship hidden in an iceberg... 2007."
"Now, I hate to do this, but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone."
"I'm sure you understand, Ms. Shipton."
No.
"I can stay here, if that's what you mean."
Excellent.
This way.
Ooh.
"As you can see, we have assembled a few of our members."
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
I know you.
You were at the crime scene.
You're a cop.
"No, but I wear the hell out of a uniform."
This is Kendall Frost.
She's a private detective based out of San Francisco.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused.
What exactly are we doing here?
Phillip Harris was a member of our society.
His death is a tragedy.
But it is also an opportunity for you or Ms. Frost.
Phillip's death has left an opening in our ranks.
Elimelech.
Who was that?
Boaz... a kinsman of mine...
just wanted to say goodbye.
and their two sons left their home in Bethlehem.
they arrived in the land of Moab where they found relief from the famine.
Elimelech died.
Naomi's two sons grew older and eventually married Moabite women named Orpah and Ruth.
they knew very little of the God of Israel:
The God of Naomi and her sons.
and Naomi loved them very much.
tragedy struck again.
Naomi's two sons also took ill and died.
Now three widows faced the future alone... together. and I want you to go back to your families.
What?
Mother?
do it for me.
but we can't let you live alone.
Bethlehem is no place for two Moabite women.
My people will not accept you.
You'll be strangers there.
As you were a stranger here.
Don't you understand?
It's my fault that you've been hurt.
The Lord has punished me.
That's not true.
Your God is good.
You are good.
you'll do as I have asked.
Go.
Return to your own people.
I will go;
- I have to finish here first.
- It's OK.
I can come back later.
- Selfish bastard!
- Cunt!
- Your costumes are just magnifique.
- Thank you.
"You can come a long way in France, with the right support."
"I feel I see who you are and what you need, you know?"
- I'm not quite sure I do.
- I could make you very successful.
- A very happy woman.
"- Thanks, but I'm doing fine."
I think you should start trusting your feelings.
Like we do in Paris.
What feelings?
You don't know who I am!
You cunt!
You loser...
Merde!
(wistful guitar music)
(busy signal)
(wistful guitar music)
(Camilla singing badly)
I thought we'd talked about you using my bathrobe.
- I'd prefer it if you didn't.
- If you insist.
(light pop music)
Sit down!
- You can keep it on for now.
"- Sit down, please."
Sit down.
Tia?
"If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too."
[tires screeching] [brakes squealing]
You the party I'm supposed to pick up?
- [Bene] just the children.
- All right.
"Meter's running, hop in."
I got it.
[cabbie grunts]
I've been waiting here forever.
"You know, people wait for taxis, not taxis wait for people."
We're exactly on time.
"Yeah, well, kind of a strange time and place to be making a pick up."
"I mean, if you're here for the next game, it's in three months."
We have seats on the 50-yard line.
[Tony laughs]
Deliver the children to this address.
You'll be paid after you arrive.
This is a big fare here.
"If these kids pay me, I hope they know I get a big tip."
"Now, everything's been arranged."
I'll see you Friday.
- Ok.
"Goodbye, Uncle Bene."
- Goodbye.
"- Have fun, you two."
- [tires screeches]
[engine revving]
[horn honking]
- Look at that dummy.
- [honking horn]
"Get off the road, you dummy."
officer david.
This is jody carvell.
I am standing outside of the larson lane house.
Are you aware that the police tape is still up?
"Yes,it's an ongoing investigation."
It's the real-eate agent.
"Okay,for how much longer?"
It costs me money every day I can't show this house.
- This is outrageous.
"- Yes,but I..."
"- no,I..."
"- I would like to speak to your pervisor,if I could."
She wants to have a word with my survisor.
"miss kemp,it's is."
We need to speak with you agN.
Rebecca?
"Rebecca,what happened?"
Did you call 911?
Hold on.
"Yes,I've got a woman here who's shot and needs immediate medical attention."
why would someone unbury a body?
I can answer that.
"To send a message.Like,""hi,I'm dead."""
"""Never get engaged to two women at the same time""?"
It would be easier to jusrent a billboard.
Second question.
where's the money?
"ah,maybe in siri's engagement ring."
I got to bring this down to abby.
I can save you an elevator trip.
"oh,that's nice."
It's creating condensation.
What if I take off your head?
Will you know then?
(LAUGHING MANICALLY)
Stop that.
What a regrettably large head you have.
I should very much like to hat it.
-Hat it?
-Yes.
"I used to hat the White Queen, you know."
"Wasn't very much to work with, poor dear."
Her head is so small.
It's tiny.
It's a pimple of a head.
But this...
"What I could do with this monument, this orb..."
"Nay, this magnificently heroic globe."
What could you do?
"Unbind him, Stayne."
How can he work if his hands are bound?
"Well, then, shall it be a bonnet or a boater?"
Or something for the boudoir?
"Cloche, dunce hat, death cap, coif, snood, barboosh, pugree, yarmulke, cockle hat, porkpie, tam o'shanter, billycock, bicorne, tricorne, bandeau, bongrace, fan-tail, night cap, Garibaldi, fez..."
Hatter.
Fez?
Leave us.
The trees seem sad.
-Have you been speaking with them?
"-Yes, Your Majesty."
Perhaps a bit more kindly.
Would you all excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.
"-What news, Bayard?"
Yoon Jae...
You came...?
Surprise!
Why did you come here?
!
What were you thinking coming here?
!
I came here to see you and some lady just suddenly appeared!
'Guess what was inside the dumplings?
'
"'Wriggly, wriggle..."
Ah!
You guessed it!
'
She said that and just dragged me inside.
I'm about to go crazy!
You're lucky that I was able to figure out the situation so quickly.
"What would you have done if I said, 'Lady, who are you?"
'
"Since I was good enough to greet them all, you take care of the rest on your own."
Bye.
Where do you think you're going?
!
"If you started out as Yoon Jae, you have to finish it out as Yoon Jae before you leave."
Okay?
What?
Seeing how he came all the way here...
I guess the wedding isn't off.
He said he was like that because he's been unwell since being in a car accident.
We misunderstood over nothing when he was sick from the accident.
"Talk it over with Yoon Jae over a spicy dumpling stew and a drink, then let it go."
Choong Sik...
Absurd?
"The spirits of my ancestors are with me always, Sam."
Are you calling them absurd?
"No, absolutely not, sir."
I meant no disrespect.
It's just...
"Either way, it's bad luck to gamble under the same roof as a restless spirit."
Good-bye.
Let's go.
Mr. Wu?
Wow.
Looks like your ace just folded.
Gotta hand it to Monica.
What?
Even death can't keep that bitch from ruining my life.
"Hey, check that out."
Camera R29.
It keeps flicking on and off.
Maybe it's a monitor problem.
Can you switch the feed?
Yep.
"Nope, looks like it's the camera."
Isn't that about where Monica flew off the...
"What, you think maybe her ghost is trying to communicate with us?"
Like Morse code?
"Short, short, long..."
"That's ""Mike."""
"Short, long, long, long...""Is."""
"""Mike is going to die."""
That's very funny.
"Whoo, yeah."
- Why don't you go check it out?
"You hear a great deal about the tempo of this city, its speed, its pace, its driving heartbeat."
"Perhaps it's true, for visitors."
"But I was born here, I live here, and the only pace I know is the pace of my own life."
The only beat I hear is the beat of my own heart.
"For me, and for millions of others, New York is home."
"The days follow each other quietly, as they do in most places."
"Only rarely does any one time stand out so that we remember it and say,"
"""That's when everything changed."
"""After that, nothing was the same. """
"There was a time like that in my life, three days."
I remember a summer evening in Gramercy Park.
"-Evening, Mr. Bourne."
-Good evening.
-Mrs.
Bourne.
-Good evening.
Must be Thursday night.
"Bran, every Thursday we have this mad dash against time."
Why?
So we won't have to rush.
I'm never late for dinner with your mother.
It's a matter of principle.
"-Jessie, darling."
"-Hello, dear."
-On the dot.
-As always.
"-Horace, good evening."
"-Hello, Brandon."
The first of the season.
-The flower I love best.
"-Hello, Hannah."
"-Thank you, Brandon."
He says it's your lucky day.
He says it's your lucky day.
"Mr Adams, Don Mackay speaking."
"Mr Adams, Don Mackay speaking."
G'day.

G'day.
Guess who just won the Golden Casket?
Wow!
I'm always happy to speak to a lottery winner.
Wow!
I'm always happy to speak to a lottery winner.
Uh...congratulations.
Thanks.
Uh...congratulations.
Thanks.
So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.
So I thought I'd splash out and buy my daughter-in-law some furniture.
That's very generous of you.
That's very generous of you.
What sort of things does your daughter-in-law like?
What sort of things does your daughter-in-law like?
The most expensive.
What else?
The most expensive.
What else?
"I tell you what,"
"I tell you what, why don't you drive to Jerilderie?"
why don't you drive to Jerilderie?
You can quote on the whole bloody house.
You can quote on the whole bloody house.
"Well, that sounds like an offer I can't refuse."
I see that she's stayed out all night.
"I'm sure she was with Yoon Jae, right?"
!
Is your daughter staying out all night something to be smiling about?
"They're going to get married in a month, so who cares?"
"With Yoon Jae always sending Da Ran home on time,"
I was worried something was wrong with Yoon Jae.
But I guess not...
Shall we invite Yoon Jae over today and make him some grilled eel?
Don't make things so obvious like that and embarrass those kids.
You're right...
Things like that...
You do for them without making it obvious.
How can you feed him eel without making it obvious?
"If you put the eel in the stuffing and give it to him in a dumpling form, don't you think that'll work?"
Eel dumplings?
!
(Eels are good for a man's virility)
Should I grow out a beard?
It's not even my body.
Why am I itchy?
Does this guy have dry skin?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Da Ran!
That person...
Looks like Yoon Jae!
Wait!
Wait!
Gil Da Ran!
Yoon Jae!
Gil Da Ran!
"Okay, if that means that Jackson could use a few thousand hours of therapy, I could've told you that myself."
What if...
It has something to do with his parents?
His real parents.
"Yeah, does anybody actually know what happened to them?"
Lydia might.
What if she doesn't know anything?
"Well, he doesn't have a restraining order against me, so..."
I'll talk to him myself.
"Okay, what do I do?"
"You have a make-up exam, remember?"
Promise me.
"If he does anything, you run the other way."
I can take care of myself.
"Allison, if you get hurt while I'm busy with some stupid test, someone's going to need to take care of me."
If he does anything...
Like?
Anything...
Weird or bizarre... anything.
Anything evil!
Ah...
Ow!
Jackson?
Did you still want to discuss your paper?
"You have one hour, Mr. McCall."
Begin.
"Really, Scott?"
I can't.
Oh...
I can't do this.
Can I do this?
"No, I am gonna go to work."
Uh-oh.
Walking me to the couch.
This can't be good.
No.
I just...
I have something really important I need to tell you and...
You could be mad.
Really mad.
But I just care about you too much to not tell you that...
That you're Hannah Montana?
Please don't interrupt me.
This is really...
Huh?
I know you're Hannah Montana.
How?
"It was that blabbermouth Siena, wasn't it?"
Didn't need any help on this one.
You both have the same beautiful eyes.
And amazing smile.
And then there's the fact that I told Miley that my dad.
Was stationed overseas and then two days later.
Hannah had a concert for kids whose parents were stationed overseas.
Hmm.
I was hoping you'd think that was just a coinkydink.
Come on six years and the rest of the world hasn't put it together.
Well the rest of the world isn't in love with Miley Stewart.
You're in love with me?
Yeah.
Um...
Unless you're not in love with me then I take that back.
"Because, you know, I'm cool."
Aw.
Back to business.
"Is it just me, or is Zach perfect?"
"He's good-looking, but not into himself, smart, but not a showoff."
"Athletic, but sensitive."
A politician's son.
"Hey, he's like Newport's Prince William."
"- Yeah, the kind of guy parents love."
"- Hey, did I tell you how stoked my dad is that I'm dating a congressman's son?"
"- He is, like, dying to go have lunch with Zach."
"- So, you going to do it?"
No way.
Remember what a Grade A disaster that was with Cohen?
"- Yeah, but Zach's not Seth."
"- Believe me, I know."
"- So, then what's the problem?"
You afraid he might actually like Zach?
Then you two will live happily ever after with no problems and nothing standing in your way?
- No.
I... no.
"- Oh, so, then you're not over Seth."
"Oh, I am."
I've divested myself of all of Seth's material possessions.
I'm vibrating at an extremely Cohenless frequency.
"- Okay, so, then you don't really like Zach."
- No.
I mean yes.
I don't...
"Ew, shut up."
"Hey, Summer."
Marissa.
Hey.
Come sit down.
"That's teenager for ""okay."""
"Now, you see what happens when you..."
"Oh, God, I do sound like that."
(cell phone chimes)
Yes!
"Thank you, God!"
You passed the evaluation?
Close enough.
I'm on probation!
- Congratulations.
- Wow.
- Probation party!
- What did you do to turn it around?
A lot of things I'm ashamed of!
"Waitress, a round of hot water and lemon for my friends!"
"Previously on ""2 Broke Girls""..."
"I am choosing to take this disaster as a sign, and while they're rebuilding this place"
I'm gonna go surprise Randy and try to rebuild us!
"Fine, use my car, but I'm going to be driving it."
I'm coming with you.
I finally got the gas pedal extension where I like it.
I'll just call AAA.
Cool.
"Later, hater."
"Wait, you're really leaving?"
Who leaves someone on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere?
"My friend, Sloppy Joe, has a one-engine plane."
He might be able to fly y'all all the way to LA.
"Well, that's a wrap on the first day of filming here in Austin, Texas."
So Randy's not in Los Angeles?
He's in Texas?

"Ah, come on in."
I could do with some company.
I feel sleepy all of a sudden.
I'll just finish marking up this.
"There it is, look."
Circling every two minutes.
- When did you pick it up?
- Just before I called you.
It's circling all the time?
Yes.
Zen says it's a Mark Three Galaxy Class cruiser.
Galaxy Class?
"That's outer planets manufacture, isn't it?"
"Right, but Mark Three went out of production at least fifty years ago."
Getting any signals from them?
"No, she's as quiet as a grave."
Probably guidance control systems
That ship's in trouble.
It's the only thing that makes any sense.
- You think so?
- Mmm.
"All right, we'd better take a look at her."
"Zen, abort course programs."
Take us in to 200 spacials and match vectors.
The timing is the key.
"Ifwe delaythe Germans by a half an hour or more, that'll solve the problem..."
They'll face the encirclement.
"How many people will you assign to the attack, mayor?"
I won't let you burythe whole regiment here.
I agree.
The Germans are not to be worried right now.
And I'll send my scout companythere.
"-Yes, I will."
-What yes?
-They'll be there.
-Who will be?
-Malyutin and his people.
- Malyutin?
-Do you mean the guywho killed the saboteurs?
- That very Malyutin.
"He isjust a boy, you know such people."
But a verytalented one.
-Will you issue such an order?
"-Yes, I will."
Because you'll give it to me.
And the orders are not to be discussed.
"OK, it is all hot talk."
We might tryto find some other solution.
"In any case, I'm not going to bury my people for peanuts."
Comrade colonel...
-What?
-A new one.
The former one was better.
OK. I'll help you if I can.
You know everything will be assigned to this breakthrough.
"Please, pass overto your Malyutin my request. lt is not an order."
They never take their eyes off it.
I heard your man telling you it was full of old documents.
"Well, that's not so."
"You see, a lot of documents is a lot of paper."
And paper's heavy.
But they lift that box as if it's as light as a feather... sir.
"Take him out, Tongue."
"- What's French for ""keep out"", Harris?"
"- Défense d'entrer, sir."
Right.
Come with me.
"Say a short prayer, Tongue."
Yea...
I say yea.
Yea.

"Fall in, Rifles."

Why is that colonel chasing you?
He's chasing you
A full troop of French cavalry?
A full colonel?
"No, they're after you."
Why?
Because of what's in that chest
Why?
Because that chest is full of papers and the colonel is a great reader?
That's why?
I don't think you're escorting me
I think I'm escorting you amigos.
"Ah, the pirate thing."
"Well, I don't need you to share."
You're something of an open book.
Am I?
Quite.
"Let's see, you volunteered to come up here because you were the most motivated."
You need to get back to a child.
"That's not perception, that's eavesdropping."
"Ah, but you don't want to abandon him the way you were abandoned."
Was I?
"Like I said, open book."
How would you know that?
"I spent many years in Neverland, home of the Lost Boys."
And they all share the same look in their eyes.
The look you get when you've been left alone.
"Yeah, well, my world ain't Neverland."

"Where does he get the balls, all right?"
To tell America's greatest city to drop dead.
- That's just it.
He never said that.
"The Daily News said he did, but he didn't say it."
"- Oh, I don't care."
"You don't, as leader of the free world, tell this city, I mean, this great city, which by the way, gave more of its sons and brothers to every war, you know, since we kept the British from"

"- Not accurate, but I get your point."
- How-
"- How do you tell a whole city of New Yorkers to drop dead, all right?"
New York is the greatest city in the world.
- Paris is a better city.
- He's right.
We got nothing on Paris.
- I wish I was in Paris right now.
- What's so fucking great about Paris?
- Shut up.

This is with dry fruits and almonds.
It would be very good.
"Just ₹ 10,000."
"I think a lot would come, as discount Mr Mutyam."

"He hid a time bomb on him, right?"
"He even carried it through prisoners' search, didn't he?"
Where did he hide it?
Right in his pocket.
- The old cigarette-match gag.

Do anything you think necessary to protect the ship.
"Leave orbit, maximum warp, anything."

"Clear, captain."
But you...
Never mind about me.
Protect my ship.
"Yes, sir."
"Photon torpedoes negative, captain."
I'm warping out of orbit.
Good.
Contact me when you can.
Kirk out.

He'll be dead in half an hour if we don't get him some decent care.
They're moving.
I've got to get to the captain.
"I've locked on to the enemy, captain."
They're moving toward the high ground.
They've locked on to my tricorder.
Very ingenious.

There are different visitors.
"-You, folks, are among them."

That's how it is.
That's what I thought.
Welcome to the table.
-Everything this house can offer.
-You are welcome.
I'm Markel Andronov.
I was born in the Tambov region.
In 1920 I served in the Tukhachevsky army and was taken as a prisoner under Byalostok.
Herfathertook me from the camp to work for him.
"We made love with her here, in the haystack."
"Oh, Virgin Mary, do not mention it."
"And when she got pregnant, I had to become a Catholic and marry her."
"When her parents died, I became the master ofthe farm."
Now I'm Pan Marek.
-Have you evertold this to anyone else?
"- No, just to you only."
"Listen, if Shulgin finds that out, he'll get you from underthe ground!"
He's got me already.
"Listen, Vanya, may be I should go to him myself, shouldn't I?"
Should I confess sicerely until it is not too late?
-The powerwill be yours now.
- Everything looks that way.
I will not come empty-handed.
I can bring a barrel of vodka.
Regulations are regulations.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
"I'm fine, Dad."

Don't ever call me Dad again.
"How do you think he'd feel about ""Mom""?"

And I'm pretty certain that it was caught on tape.
You know what you said in there?

You didn't get the plates?
- We didn't.
"- What say, Pakia...?"
You said that your information is very accurate.
"Yes, Uncle."
The plates were in Kania's godown.
The thing is...
Kania got to know about our imminent arrival much before.
We were only 2.
And they were 50.
They surrounded us from all sides.
We forgot the plates and somehow saved our lives.
"What say, Baba?"
It doesn't matter if you didn't get the plates.
I can sacrifice thousands of plates in the names of tigers like you.
I will deal with Kania later.

You don't know how to make people happy.
You cannot deceive my heart.
How come you're meeting with that kind of guy?
"That's what I don't understand,"
Withdraw from this plan.
When I get back I'll do it on my own.

"Lee Yoon Sung,"
My father...
Please forgive him.
I'm sorry.
Kim Young Joo.
Kim Young Joo!
Kim Young Joo!
"If you want to see the classified documents, come to the Seoul junkyard"
- City Hunter.
"Father, why did you do that?"
Why did you have to lie and tell Kim Yong Joo to go there?
This Republic of Korea Prosecutor wanted to know the truth...
I was just helping him.
Do you know?
"The person who killed the innocent Kim Young Joo... is no one else but you, Father."
"Even if someone commits no sins, that person can die at anytime."
Just like my colleagues did.
"Now, that Cheon Jae Man will die by my hands."
Let's go!
So you want to smuggle your way out.
The punk who's smuggled himself out knows what that feeling is like.
Sure!
"- So, why..."
- Huh?
Ouch!
Wh-Wh-What?
I only got closer because you were speaking softly!
Ahh...
Is this okay?
Y-Yeah.
That will do.
How did you figure it out?
"You mean, ""How did you realize that I was the person behind Eromanga-sensei""?"
Yup.
"If not, I won't ever let you in."
"When you were streaming, the meal I made for you was in the background."
"You forgot to turn the camera off, and you started taking your clothes off..."
Th-That's enough.
I get it now.
"So after all, Big Brother, you were ""Masamune Izumi-sensei""."
"""After all""?"
You had noticed?
I was just thinking you had the same name.
For it to actually be the same person...
What kind of probability is that?
To think that I've been living under the same roof as Eromanga-sensei.
I can't believe it.
And I don't know anyone by that name.
"Um, this is so sudden, and I don't know what to do."
"For starters, I'm sorry I made you draw all those lewd pictures!"
I-Idiot!
"Don't suddenly shout so loudly, idiot!"
Y-You're the idiot!
Wait a bit.
- How much do you charge?
- Let go of me!
Fuck.
- That's what I'm asking about.
- Go eat shit.
Alright.
- So what are you doing right now?
"- Nothing, nothing."
There's some boys that need a medic.
- Come with me.
- I didn't finish my studies.
"If you don't say anything then I won't either, alright?"
Come.
- Jimmy!
- I thought you weren't coming.
We have to stop along the way.
Pasqualino's coming too.
Let's go!
"As you can see, the interior of Vesuvius isn't dormant."
"And examining the seismographs, we can see that activity... has increased in recent weeks."
- Does that always happen?
- Absolutely not.
This is the first time I see this phenomenon.
- Strange...
- Yes.
"Maria, we..."
"Excuse me, one moment."
Maria!
Where are you going?
What about the picnic?
Tell my father we're going to see the nuns.
"We shall test each other's courage, and then... and then we shall see."
Let's get on with it.
"As you will, sir."
"Honor will be served, eh?"
"Oh, wait!"
"As the one challenged, I claim the first shot."
We shoot together.
"It's my game and my rules, but if you need to be persuaded..."
All right.
Captain...
"And now, Captain, how do you have the expression?"
My fate is in your hands.
You've ruined everything!
The machine.

The remarkable treachery of this species.
"Go on, Trelane."
Look at it.
It's over.
Your power is blanked out.
You're finished.
You've earned my wrath.
Go back.
"Go back to your ship, all of you, and prepare."
"You're all dead men-- you especially, Captain."
Trelane?
"Everyone, we're getting out of here, and now."
This is the captain.

-Yes.
Leave it to me.

-The Master's out here somewhere.
-I came here to find the Master.
-No.

"""And the opponent makes no allowances for mistakes,"

I'm an ignorant old Doctor.
And I've made a mistake.
There's only one direction help can come from now.
I'll just have to sit here and wait.
"Ah, yes!"
Something along those lines.
The mark of the Master.
He must have added his own voice to the numbers and corrupted the Doctor's code.
But he's still here somewhere.
-I saw him.
He's been following us.
-The Master?
I think so.
- I want him dead and disintegrated!
"- Roger, General."
We continue the search.
We need an evacuation group.
Ishmael is almost frozen.
You must leave here immediately.
General?
Can you hear me?
Send an evacuation group.
I repeat:
Send an evacuation group.
"Will we stay here all night, or what?"
An electromagnetic storm is coming.
"If we wait, we'll lose Ash."
"If we move now, we still have a chance."
"I can do it, Commander!"
"Kix, stay with Ishmael, until the storm is over."
I'm not a fucking nanny!
"""What were Trajan's orders?"""
- Ash's going to die.
Then I'll take care of that.
"I was born to hunt, Commander."
The collection team arrives in the morning.
All you have to do is stay warm until then.
"Can you do that for me, Spartan?"
"I can do it, Commander."
"Stay strong, brother."
See you upstairs.
"What is it, Kix?"
Where's the fucking bitch with thick balls now ?

"I have your breath hanging right here, Hatta."

The situation is becoming very serious.

Please don't waste any more time.
Good day.
You're not going to school today?
I'm sick.
My stomach hurts.
What did you do yesterday afternoon?
I went to a movie.
With who?
- With some friends.
- What friends?
"One moment, I'll be right back."
Who were you with yesterday at the hunting lodge?
"Who was the man in the hat, Marina?"
What man?
Aren't you a little hot in that sweater?
I'm sick.
How did you hurt yourself?
- What?
- Your wrist.
My watch gives me a rash.
Everything is going absolutely according to plan.
Right now the most important thing to me
Is sending jake home.
It's mind-boggling.
"Like, I just wanna punch the guy."
"I can't do it, so I'm gonna punch him mentally"
"And just beat down his spirits, drive him crazy."
He's gonna go nuts.
"He's gonna try to talk his way out of everything,"
And there's nothing he can do.
"Peace, bro."
Jake's a joke.
I'll be damned if I lose the next competition to him.

Confirming they're loading the money.
Let's wrap this up.
"Stenz, we're wasting our time here."
"Walker, are you sure they're down here?"
Did I spend 15 goddamn years running this place or did you?

This guy is losing it.
What do we care if he gets the president?
We made a deal.
Cale was right.
This is not about ransom.
Walker has cancer.
His doctors gave him less than three months.
He has a golfballsized tumor on his frontal lobe.

I think he's on a suicide mission.
You ready?
Yes.
What do you think you're doing?
If anybody can talk him down..
"it's her, trust me."
A little birdie told me you're finally moving the money.
Martin?
"I had to tell them about the tumor, Martin."
The Major's found your money.
- No!

"Thank you so much, Major."
There you are.
I told you it would turn up.

"That girl, Eul, doesn't know her place."
How could she linger around you?
"Noona, from your perspective,"
I think I'm better than Eul.
Of course!
"Even though you're still unemployed, you can't give yourself to Eul."
Eul is in a lot of debt and doesn't even have a great personality.
She only mooches off of you.
So that's why I'm telling you this.
"Oppa, there is a woman I know who cooks well, has enough money, and doesn't fall too far behind in terms of looks."
"I... am not good enough, Noona."
"Because I am not good enough,"
I cannot accept Eul.
"Ah, Eul left her cellphone."
So clumsy...
That oppa is not normal either.
Eul!
No Eul!
What is this?
Yes.
This is No Eul's phone.
Hello?
Why are you picking up No Eul's phone?
"We were together, and Eul left her phone behind."
- Who is the person picking up the phone?
- What about you?
Who are you?
- I asked first.
"- When you ask for someone else's identity,"
I believe you should reveal your identity first.

"And he had him nailed, till trial."

"Gentlemen, that ship sailed."

Not for cardoza.
"Well, that doesn't sound like my business."
It is now.
"All right, gentlemen, follow me."
All this evidence says one thing:
Enright murdered his wife brutally.
The guy's a known wife abuser.
Jesse found blood from the dead wife
On enright's clothes and in his car.
And then he walks.
Yeah.
Right in front of all the cameras.

Do you know why your daughters wanted to leave?
My daughters didn't want to go anywhere.
Did anyone want to hurt them?

- To find your daughters.

You're here because her cousin served with Judge Andrade.
So skip the song and dance and just find them.

I'll be over here if you have any more questions.
"Vadim, Chen, report."
"We're done with the residence, boss."
Coming up to the third floor.
Shit.
You have many fine qualities.
"You are big and strong... full of life, mischief."
I have always feel positive towards you.
"You should see yourself now... in the shadows there, with the smoke all around you."
You're beautiful.
You remind me of that movie star....
-Irina is beautiful.
-Greta Garbo.
-May I help you?
-Yeah.
"Brad to reception, your 1:00 client is here."
You'll call me later?
No phone calls for the first two weeks.
House rules.
I'll write.
I was thinking of keeping a journal anyway.
"Get it published, maybe, under my pen name."
Congratulations.
"You got here, dude."
That's the hardest part.
I'm going to have to search your bag.
"-Cigarettes are Okay, right?"
-Cigarettes are fine.
They're encouraged for patients who smoke.
"But, Chris, no chocolate allowed."
No caffeine or substances containing caffeine.
All set?
"-I love you, baby."
"-I love you, too."
When's Bill coming back?
Next week.
I'll be busy for a few days... but I'll see you when I can.
Quite possibly in her death.
"That's fascinating, sir."
You've got quite a way of putting things.
Especially about Mrs. Daley.
"Let me ask you, sir."
Could you maybe tell me more about her?
Not much.
But you're right.
"About what, sir?"
What you're thinking.
I was lying before.
I didn't like Claire very much.
I haven't for years.
Which doesn't mean to say
"I wasrt shocked by the news of her death, I was."
"And I was still a little bit shook up when you first walked in, so I said whatever sounded right to a detective."
Some other detective.
Not you.
Please sit down.
"Properties, a glass for the Lieutenant, please."
MAN:
"Yes, sir."
"You had me absolutely fooled, sir."
Really?
Scout's honor.
Even after you asked a few questions around the set?
Thank you.
"Our fights, Claire's and mine, werert always discreet."
"And some of them were overheard, I believe."
You must have been told by the crew.
You know how people talk.
"Yes, I do."
- [exhales]
"My friends are here, school's here,"
- the scout's are here.
- Hazel...
It's scary.
"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
It was just a thought. [exhales]
It was... it was... like make-believe.
"I'll never make you do that, sweetie."
Take wind data and render it into 3D.

Close-up on the lower frame in front of me.
Am I interrupting?
Or are you busy making private time with our home network?
That minx.
Power down.
"Mr. Larson, setting aside work for your wife?"
This is a first.
I told you this morning.
I wanna put us first.
[soft music]
- [giggles] - [breathing heavily]
♪
[soft dramatic music]
I see you upgraded your gear.
"Well, you never know what kind of scumbag"
I might catch sneaking around my office.
I'm not worried.
You can't aim worth a shit.
[both laugh]
The last time I saw you was when?
What are you doing?
No!
Let me go!
"Oh no, I've been caught!"
"Help me, Big Sis!"
Ow!
Ow!
I'm gonna die!
No more!
Not there!
This is a situation neither the North nor the South should want.
"Not only that, there's absolutely no consistency to the Venom's destruction."
So it's most likely the work of someone operating independently.
"But who in the world would make the North and South fight each other, and for what purpose?"
"President Hunter, you have a guest."
She has been anxious to see you.
It seems urgent.
Turn her away.
- Even you should understand what kind of crisis I'm facing right now.
- Hey!
Get out of my way!
"Hey you, you shouldn't be here!"
I'm telling you to let me see him!
A Helmajistani?
"Nope, don't know anyone like that."
But a lot of Arabs live in that building over there.
"So you're Kashim, huh?"
"You reek of alcohol, you worthless brat."
"Are you trying to ruin the reputation of ""Bdakshon's Tiger""?"
As if I even care.
State your business.
A Chinese girl asked me to give this to you.
"Goodbye, Mrs John!"
- Bye.
Mealtime!
Thanks so much for your visit...
"Ei Ei, now look."
Ei!
"Now stop that, Selma!"
The only thing missing is that mine is infected by yours.
"It isn't contagious, or else I would've gotten tuberculosis a long time ago"
And you did say that I could put it down here.
"Yes, once upon a time!"
"When one has one's own, one can no longer take care of strangers' kids."
Now get out of the parlour...
Where is Miss Pauline?
How come?
When I went to the laundry yesterday there was a new one there!
"Oh well, and?"
I sent for her from the employment exchange due to my condition.
The other one went back where she came from...
Back?
But she didn't want to go back at all!
What do I care what she wanted?
Get out!
One may still ask!
What are you doing down here?
Are you not pleased with my hotel anymore or..am I perhaps not friendly with you?
Yes...
You are like a brother.
Brother?
Nobody has told me that before.
"Well, that is an outright insult, indeed it is!"
Oh well...
I'm... not...?
Rest assured.
You won't have a thing to worry about.
"It is unfortunate but, another one of our students disappeared last night."
We have requested the help of the authorities who now are conducting a thorough investigation.
I'd like to ask all you students to be on the alert...
"All the ones who've disappeared were athletes, right?"
Yes.
"Yesterday, it was the captain of the tennis team."
You might be the next target of the kidnappers.
That's ridiculous!
"When you have that look in your eye, I know you're scheming."
Uh-uh.
Who's planning to capture the kidnappers?
See.
You are!
"Why, the shy little guy's waiting for her?"
Huh?
For who?
Do you plan to get her alone by saying...
"""It's a little dangerous, so shall I walk you home? """
"No, uh... but..."
"What, were you going to invite me along?"
"Sorry, but I have other plans."
See ya!
Go straight home!
Shall we go?
Uh-hmm...
Straight home...
Yeah.
Sure.
You kidnappers...!
My God!
How could they think threatical vehicles as words can express... what Lacroix is all about?
Don't they get it?
Don't they understand?
He's not about a dictionary... he's about spirit!
"Oh, God!"
"Spirit, spirit, spirit!"
Any messages?
A fax is coming in.
From Europe!
Paris studios.
Carl Lagerfeld to... the Editor in Chief.
I have a fax for the Editor in Chief.
The Editor in Chief is waiting for it.
You can go in.
"I'm sorry to interrupt, I have a fax for you."
Okay.
Thanks.
"The work is piling up, and I really should be getting to it."
"I have to retype a roll of decks, get tea, pick up a huge garment... bag, anyway, the xerox machine awaits me."
"So, now you know the people on staff aren't really snobs."
They're just better than everybody else is.
Is it enough?
"- That was great, thank you ."
- Let me know when it's on.
I can watch in my time off on Channel 13.
"Thanks a lot, kiddo."
Hang in there.
It seems like a pretty tough place to work.
"Hey, Paul."
These are the photos for the acessory page.
She's gonna come here and show you exactly how she wants them.
So unless he's here to report a crime...
I can't allow him in this building.
I don't know.
Makes you think.
Vic says the guy was a real crackerjack cop.
"Somebody like him can get booted, man, none of us are safe."
Come on.
The guy's old.
Probably lost his edge.
–Nothing's gonna happen to us.
–How are you so sure?
Because we're careful.
Because Joe got sloppy and stupid.
"Stupid, huh?"
"–Vic, I..."
–What's stupid is Joe's twice the cop you'll ever be.
You're too sloppy to even know it.
–Here we go again.
–I guess so.
"You know, I'm gettin' a little tired of this bullshit."
I'm gettin' tired of constantly having to clean up after your bullshit!
"Every time something goes to shit in your life, I become your whipping boy."
Why don't you find someone else?
–Maybe that's exactly what I'll do.
–You want my transfer request?
"Say the word, Vic!"
It'll be on Aceveda's desk first thing in the morning!
–Fine.
Write it up.
–Fine!
Asshole.
–What'd you call me?
Shut up.

"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
Those words had been dancing around my head all night.
"I mean, it's Vegas lore, that phrase."
"Just ask any of the old-time pit bosses, they'll know."
It was a Chinese dealer at Binion's who was first credited with the line.
He would shout it every time he dealt blackjack.
"That was over 40 years ago, and the words still catch."
"Winner, winner, chicken dinner."
There it is!
"""Winner, winner, chicken dinner."""
"Yeah, try it."
I had heard it at least 14 times that night.
I couldn't lose.
"First of all, what I was doing wasn't illegal."
"There were certain institutions and people that frowned upon it, but it's legal."
And not everyone can do it.
Just those with gifted minds.
I have a gifted mind.
That's what got me into all this mess.
"I was counting cards and I was up over $640,000."
All right!
I'm just gonna have to split those tens.
- Splitting tens.
- Splitting tens again.
"Well, that's all right."
I've been winning and losing for years.
- so you do care a little bit -- a very little bit.
- what?
no!
i didn't ask my mama to leave me this place.
- so why didn't you sell it?
- 'cause.
- 'cause why?
"- 'cause i just didn't, okay?"
kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes.
- what'd you say?
i couldn't hear you.
"- i said it kind of makes me think about my mama sometimes -- big, fat, hairy deal."
- let's go.
"- oh, come on."
like i don't see this [chuckles] guy enough every day.
- all right. i got you.
"you're looking for something adventurous and sexy, right?"
"i got you this sporty model -- very popular, top-of-the-line."
- it is a beautiful machine.
"- oh, yeah."
- but i'm looking for something a little more family-oriented.
- oh!
got you!
"little lady prego, huh?"
huh?
"- uh, no. no."
- [chuckles]
"- but i have plenty of cash for a down payment, so..."
- ohh!
what an idiot!
who tells a car salesman they have a pocket full of cash?
"- but did you notice he was looking for something ""family-oriented""?"
- I don't know how.
"Ma'am, come to this window."
Do you know Peppe?
Are you crazy?
What did I do?
"Go home, if the director sees you..."
So peaceful.
They're all happy to have you here.
"And you, everything alright at work?"
I can't complain.
Can I tell you something?
Why get involved in...
You can ruin...
Are you married?
"Yes, we have a beautiful 8-year-oId son."
Yourwife didn't come.
"No, because..."
"We'd given up on children, an incredible joy, but since he was born silvia's become apprehensive, depressed, if I'd brought herhere..."
"Why, it's depressing here?"
She might get overit.
Of course.
"The move, school, packing..."
An outsider coming to the South cries when he arrives and when he leaves.
"It's true, when I came here I was upset."
- Just imagine when you leave!
- I don't think so.
"I'm fine here, but my home is up there."
"I Iike the fog, the people, the chaos."
Things you can't understand.
Coffee break.
- Good?
- Like only in naples.
A beauty like yours never changes.
"Come, my dear."
I'll lead you.
It was to discover your thoughts.
You didn't answer me yet.
Well... it is yes.
Yes?
You mean...
"Yes, yes really?"
Yes.
I agree to become your wife.
Now let me.
Come and get me shortly.
Do not be afraid.
Sleep.
Sleep.
"In the violent effort made by the thief to snatch the necklace and earrings from the princess his fingers, pressing on the neck of Princess Danidoff, left a slight trace of sweating."
I spilled the silver nitrate on the princess' neck
You see the results.
Effectively.
The print is very clear.
It needs to be indentified.
We are not at the end of our inquiry.
"Wait a moment, my little Fandor, you have not seen everything."
Look at the details.
"The small scar, on both shots."
These two fingerprints are identical.
Absolutely identical.
And where does the second impression come from?
The anthropometric file.
The name.
The name of the culprit.
"Officially, nobody, of course."
I'm on sick leave from the police.
Post traumatic stress.
"Yeah, and unofficially?"
I don't really think that's any of your concern.
My job's to disorganise crime.
Illegally.
I prefer to use the world irregular.
"Yeah, yeah, I bet you do."
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
Unfortunately a million extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould.
Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him either.
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"Niece and nephew, right?"
Yeah.
"I haven't got 'em any presents, though."
A bit behind when it comes to computer games and stuff like that.
You should talk to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games."
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John, that'd be irresponsible!"
That's not their age range at all!
How did it go with Lenny?
"Yeah, pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"I guess that's what you did in the Army, right?"
Wrong.
That was legal.
Yeah.
- I don't think so madam.
"Lawyers won't even get office space, then how would they get house?"
"- Hey fast-food, tea for both of us."
- I want milk.
"If you drink this tea, you won't live to drink milk tomorrow."
-How much is your commission?
- Why?
"Don't you know it is 10,000?"
"- OK, find out that girl's profession."
- Alright.
- What?
- What is that girl's profession?
- Lawyer
Seems like I am gonna lose the money!
"She is a software engineer, it seems."
Your accent is wrong.
It is software engineer
Yes you got it.
I must change my house now.
Check out his profession.
- What now?
- What is that guy's job?
Lawyer
"- Manager in some marketing sector, it seems."
"- OK for me, then ."
How long would you count the cash?
Give it.
"Now that you have successfully clinched your deal, won't you give me a treat?"
- Treat?
You want sambar rice from Saravana Bhavan?
- No.
I want booze.
"Oh, put those greasy newspapers in the dustbin, Henry."
They're smelling the place out.
It's like French perfume to me.
"Ahh, tomato soup."
My favourite.
Sir.
Oh.
"Oh, you're very kind."
lsn't she kind?
Don't mention it.
Erm...have you been in any good pubs lately?
"Oh, delicious soup, my lord."
Do you have a French chef?
"No, just an ordinary, plain cook."
"Eh, Stokes?"
"Yes, very plain, my lord."
"Hey, Cissy, did you not speak at a meetin' of the United Workers Party?"
"Yes, I put myself up as candidate for the party in the local by-election."
- Do you think I'll get in.
- Nah.
Not with that eyeglass and the posh accent.
We all thought you were patronising' us.
I found the whole thing very embarrassing.
"I'm sure nobody could hold you responsible for the actions of your children, my lord."
"Which would you like to taste first, my lord?"
"The stout, the raspberryade, or the Montrachet?"
The bishop's arrived.
They're all having coffee in the drawing room.
"Well, I'll be off now, then."
"Erm, you can take those cold chips home with you."
Oooh.
That'll be nice.
Sorry!
Can we finish it off now?
Shall we do our work here or... some where in private?
"Papa, he's asking your choice, You would like to die here or... inside in private."
Whom you're working for?
"Virus Autos, I gave you my card,"
"Viruses Autos, It seems a foreigner gang,"
What's your Boss name?
"Mr. D.M. Pipot, Mr. D.M. Pipot,"
Why this pipot wants to kill me?
"Actually Sir, your... to kill, you say kill, Why he needs to kill you?"
Then why you came here to kills me?
Sir I... not kills Sir!
K I L L kill.
"You add S with every English word, Sir, that's not right, Sir!"
"It's Papa's S, he will add where he wants."
Why you want to kill me?
"Sir, why I should I kill you?"
"You're joking, Sir."
"Papa, don't talk to him, kill him otherwise, he will kill us with his questions."
You making my death mock.
Papa!
He's dead.
"Marveles shooting, Marveles shooting,"
"After long distance,"
Papa has learn to shoot.
"Thanks, My sons."
"Excuse me,"
Mr. D'Melo.
This is not fair.
"You know I have to go for another work, and you have ruined my face."
Where is Bathroom?
This is Calvin.
You're thinking about the pledging from the Omega Chi.
Spitter and Quiter.
Excellent.
You're awesome.
"Thanks, I think."
"Hey Eth, you met my friend Calvin."
I have.
On more than one occasion.
The mystery guy.
That's cool.
It's weird for me to picture but... completely cool.
"So, how've you been?"
Couldn't be better.
"So fellas, I have a little anouncement to make."
"Join me, in the basement, for a chapter meeting in five."
"All right, libations will be provided."
"- He can stay, right?"
"- Well, can he keep a secret?"
"Because, if you can't keep a secret."
You should leave the room right now.
- You all with me?
- Can we see a little of the ZBZ swear?
We're going to throw a party.
A theme party based on the book The Great Gatsby.
Which we all know is a big Lizzi favorite.
"There will be great costumes, fun music and a dance instructor that's gonna teach us dances from the 20."
Did I just fell asleep with my eyes open?
I haven't finished yet.
That's just...
- the upstairs party.
"- But downstairs,"
"I mean, if her mother's not home, you know?"
"- But, who else gets paid to fuck?"
- Ho's.
"People, watch my shit."
Everybody on the floor!
"Hey, bruja!"
"You better not be drinking out of the bottle, you know how Carlos hates that."
Carlos?
That nigga ain't here.
Which one of your hooker friends is this one for?
"You should let me know, so I could roll up and fuck her."
Sometimes I wonder how we come from the same two people.
Get the fuck outta here.
We both got a talent for merchandising.
Merchandising?
Is that what you're calling it?
Merchandising?
Why don't you let a nigga set you up?
Set you up with a little shop.
We can keep all your shit there.
Because I can take care of all my shit right here in my house.
"It's all right, hermanita."
"One day, I'm gonna open you up a store, when you come back with me to the D.R., en la Calle del Sol, we could call it ""Maggie's."""
Yeah?
Give it to Darlene.
Are you trippin'?
You know Carlos ain't gonna take care of your ass.
Like everybody else in this motherfucker-- out for himself.
"You know what, hermanito?"
Why don't you support your kids...
y déjame de joder?
I was looking out for my little sister.
Astal thinks he's going to a safe place.
Fifty Magic Knights.
What a clown.
He thinks he can bare his fangs at the prince and win.
Hilarious!
You sick-minded manipulator!
Don't you dare look at my sister that rudely!
The prince?
Brother.
"What's the matter, Sister?"
I can't breathe!
"Ferris, you always spoil Iris so."
Jobs should be thoroughly finished.
"If we let a man like this live, it would sully the Eris family, would it not?"
What's your intent?
Is the prince behind this?
Does that mean Sion is also a prince?
The Eris family serves only the king of Roland.
The true king.
The king?
We must see whether or not Sion would be a suitable king.
"Will he make it back alive, faced with a troop of fifty Magic Knights?"
Impossible.
I could do it.
Sion isn't you.
He most certainly isn't.
But he carries something.
"You met Sion, and as a result, you saved his life."
Don't you find that fascinating?
"I'm not particularly fascinated, no."
Staying asleep
Losing sight of you
"So, um, can I get anybody a drink or--"
"Okay, you need to tell her."
"Um, tell her--"
"About you, about me, about everything."
"You know, I'm really sorry."
I have no idea what he expects you to do.
"Monroe, you need to show her what a Blutbad is."
"Okay, I-- you want to explain to me how we suddenly arrived at this crucial crux kind of a zenith pinnacle moment?"
Juliette got scratched by a cat.
"Um, well, that's too bad, but I'm not sure how that qualifies--"
- The cat belongs to Adalind.
- Oh.
That's actually not so good.
And I took her to the trailer.
- Adalind?
"- No, Juliette."
"I-I showed her everything, I told her everything."
She thinks I'm crazy.
"Ho, okay."
"So we're just kind of jumping out of the old airplane without a parachute here, huh?"
"Monroe, you're my last chance."
You have to do this.
Nick.
Enough.
"Juliette, I don't care if you believe me anymore."
- I'm just worried about you.
- You're worried about me?
You don't understand what Adalind is capable of.
I'm going home.
This is ridiculous.
"[Sighs] Okay, okay."
Just give me a second to get into it.
"I'm reminded of something Descartes once said,"
"""Whether I am awake or asleep, two and three will always make five."
"""A square can never have more than four sides."
"""It does not seem possible that truths"
"""so clear and apparent can be suspected of any uncertainty."""
"Uh, this book has taken me over 14 years to write."
It is not without a little sadness that I say goodbye to it consuming my days and nights.
And nights...
Um...
And so...
And as I stand here...
"And so, in coming up..."
Summing up...
Uh...
"Excuse me, I'm feeling a little dizzy."
Uh...
I thought it would feel differently.
I thought I would know more.
I don't.
"I don't know anything, really."
Thank you all for coming.
Thanks.
Thank you.
"Oh, God."
What did I say?
"It was fine, although I'd think twice about doing volunteer work for a suicide hotline."
You were doing okay until Candice walked in.
"Don't start, Henry."
I just forgot to eat.
You should never drink on an empty stomach.
"Listen, it's perfectly natural."
"She left you what, a year ago?"
She was asleep on the couch with the door open.
"I couldn't stop myself, Beth."
She'd lied to me.
I picked up an ashtray.
I hit her.
I couldn't help it.
I hit her and hit her and hit her.
That's very interesting.
It explains a lot.
"- You're trespassing, Lieutenant."
"- Take it easy, Perry."
I have a warrant here.
"Mr. Sandover, you understand that anything you've said to me that might have been overheard by Lieutenant Tragg--"
What difference does it make?
I killed her.
"I have to tell, Mr. Mason."
"I killed her, yes."
And then I put a necktie in her hand.
She was always playing with neckties.
It was Enos's necktie.
"Thank you, Mr. Sandover."
"But suppose you tell us all this down at headquarters, eh?"
"Now look here, Tragg--"
"It's too bad you didn't check sooner with us, Perry."
"You see, when this guy struck her,"
Lita Krail had probably been dead for over a half an hour.
The doctor found the bullet in her heart.
[Tragg] My warrant is for Mrs. Sandover... for murder.
"Well, that's-- that's it, Perry."
"I did go out there, but I was with Lita only 20 minutes or so."
It was sometime after 11:00.
When did she call you?
Be cool.
"Okay, you're now both officially represented by Saul Goodman and Associates."
Your secrets are safe with me under threat of disbarment.
All right?
Take the ski mask off.
I feel like I'm talking to the Weather Underground.
Just do it.
"Okay, so if a prison shanking is completely off the table..."
And we're sure of that?
No shanking!
"All right, all right."
The way I see it is somebody is going to prison.
It's just a matter of who.
All right.
"Lame-ass TV ads aside your lawyer here, he cooked you up a pretty killer deal."
"Time served, no probation."
It's pretty slick.
Couldn't believe the judge went for it.
Don't get cocky.
You ain't home free yet.
You don't give us the name of your supplier...
- ...you're going nowhere.
- The tough guy act is unnecessary.
This young man is cooperating fully.
Is that right?
"Yeah, you cooperating?"
"Okay, let's start with a name."
He just goes by Heisenberg.
"Heisenberg, huh?"
How old is this Heisenberg?
Old.
Like 50 or 70 or something.
What is this?
Ow'
"Yeow' Oh, ow, ow, oh'"
I think I'd better go see what Louie is up to.
"Come out, you little pipsqueak, and fight like a man'"
- Louie'
- Ow.
- What are you doing?
"- Well, I-I-I wasjust, uh, uh, uh--"
"I'm sorry, madame."
"You know, Eric, perhaps ouryoung guest might enjoy... seeing some ofthe sights ofthe kingdom."
Something in the way ofa tour.
"I'm sorry, Grim."
What was that?
You can't spend all your time moping about.
You need to get out.
Do something.
Have a life.
Get your mind off--
"Easy, Grim, easy."
"It's not a bad idea, ifshe's interested."
"Well, what do ya say?"
Would you like tojoin me... on a tour of my kingdom tomorrow?
"Wonderful' Now, let's eat before this crab wanders off my plate."
"Come here, boy."
"This has got to be, without a doubt... the single most humiliating day of my life."
"I hope that you appreciate what I go through foryou, young lady."
"Now, we got to make a plan to get that boy to kiss you."
"Tomorrow, when he takes you for that ride, you gotta lookyour best."
"You gotta bat your eyes, like this."
"You gotta pucker up your lips, like this."
"You are hopeless, child."
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also gIitters, but it's not frightening."
moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened--"
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""hello, hello."""
I heard a feeble voice.
I Iooked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi--"""
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there."""
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I Iooked around... he was gone.
- Let's sign the papers.
- You're using good judgment.
We'll go right up to the office.
"Alright, we can rehearse Miss Chummy now."
Aah!
"(Commodore) Mr. Ganz, Mr. Ganz?"
We may as well adjust our little business now.
The understanding was that I was to receive 10% if you recall.
"Uh, 10% of the show."
"No cash, Commodore."
"Oh, but confounded, sir, I insist upon the cash."
I'm not putting money into plays at my age.
"Well, if you'd prefer $1500 to a possible fortune it's alright with me, Commodore."
"Uh, Regan?"
"Yes, Mr. Ganz."
Has Bryson called about the ticket buy?
- 'Bryson?
'
- Yes.
He was to call and make an offer for a block of seats for six weeks.
"Uh, let me see, um 300 seats at four dollars, uh, $1200."
"Multiplied by eight, uh, $9600."
"Multiplied by six roughly, uh, $58,000, uh..."
"Pardon, pardon me, Mr. Ganz."
"On, ahem, on second thought"
I may take an interest in the show for my percentage.
I'm not in need of cash at the moment and it may offer me a bit of diversion.
"Well, now you're talking."
"Come along, Commodore we'll fix you right up."
- Are you alright?
- Mm-hmm.
"Oh, I feel fine."
How do you mean?
"For example, he says that Dave is de-prioritizing me, that he doesn't pay attention to what I actually want."
"Yeah, but, honey, that's just Dave being Dave, you know?"
Yeah.
"But so then, what if Dave being Dave is sort of like"
Dave bulldozing me?
Please continue to look at the fish!
Enjoy them as they come at you!
"I get it, dude, it's advanced snorkeling."
Dave...
"Hey, I'm trying to do this exercise!"
"Why don't we talk about this during down time, okay?"
This might be what the therapist is referring to.
You're missing out on life.
"It's happening right now, out here, all around us, all right?"
And you're too busy complaining about your problems to enjoy all these beautiful little fish that are...
Marcel!
Yes?
"Marcel, we have a real problem here!"
It is not a problem!
It is a circle of life!
The circle of life is circling our lives right now!
"Do not move, do not panic."
Shark!
What?
Shark!
Jason!
"Okay, it's all happening, Marcel!"
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
Don't worry!
I left my hand phone in your car.
Please take it out for me before you continue what you were doing.
What are you saying?
Ah...
I shouldn't have called for you.
I bet he'll file a complaint.
"You should leave, go."
The car is actually just over there.
I saw my phone in there.
So unlucky!
My hand phone.
"Oh, Oh... my replacement driver job!"
My money... my money...
Hospital?
Did you directly see him collect the money?
He didn't give bribes in front of me.
I only heard.
How much was it?
"Of course, millions."
Millions?
How many millions?
It is all written down in a manual.
"Since he's cautious, he always writes it down."
He's so cautious.
Manual?
What?
What is she doing?
"Please I beg you to do the operation, doctor."
"Today, I just earned money to pay the Hospital."
I hope you can understand my difficulties.
Why must we perform a surgery on a comatose patient?
-=Stent Surgery: stent implantation=- To do such an operation requires a huge amount of money.
700 ships went to Dunkirk!
"338,000 men came back!"
"Don't say, ""It's based on a true story""!"
"Say, ""It's based on a hundred true stories""!"
A thousand!
Three hundred thirty eight thousand.
"Dunkirk, the biggest retreat in military history, or, the miracle that put the fire back in all our bellies."
Very well.
Carry on as you were.
I've a car waiting.
Buckley?
Buckley?
I don't care that you lied.
I cared that you lied to us.
There wasn't enough money.
Ellis wanted me to back to Wales.
Do you want me to compare to Mr.Blitz?
I'm sorry.
Well his partner would be relieved.
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him, you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you would find yourself in a similar position,"
With your husband Spanish War and all.
Should I...do you want me to come in tomorrow?
How would that help losing you?
Who the bloody hell do you think is going to be running the slob?
"The work's good, Mrs.Cole. You do a good job."
Oh!
Oh.
Hello Catrin.
Hello.
Hello.
Does father have piles?
Actually my dad and I are thinking to come your home and discuss about marriage.
Marriage?
Who is this girl?
You wait mom.
I too have the same doubt.
Who are you?
Who am I?
- I will tell.
Friend of the Police officer who looks same as you or his girlfriend.
"Sorry, even I was confused before and now you are confused."
"He is not your guy, but our guy."
I don't believe this.
Your guy talks fluent in Hindi and my fellow murders it.
If required test him.
I am unable to understand what is happening here.
Is this true?
"Dad, what is she saying?"
- Hindi..
This is so strange.
"I just watched dual roles only in films, but never thought I would experience it."
"If you don't mind, I will take a photo and send it to my boyfriend."
Sure..
- He will be really shocked.
"Sorry uncle, sorry aunty I need to search where he is."
Bye..
Let us see the saris there.
Come on.
Tell the truth.
Is there another one just like you?
"Yes, he is there."
Here.
I can feel it closing in on my nuts right now.
And after that conversation with the Bossman?
"I don't know, I'm starting to think maybe we are on the evil side of things here."
"Maybe you're just not emotionally cut out for this, Joe."
"Yeah, maybe."
"And clearly, you're not either."
I ever tell you the story about my dad?
"What, your real dad or your adoptive dad?"
"Asshole, my adoptive dad is my real dad."
"Okay, okay, good."
I didn't wanna hear a story about you searching for your biological father.
"- Shut the fuck up, Joe."
- Done.
Please continue.
"My dad Carl was a loving man, tough man."
- Like you.
"- Much more loving, much tougher."
"He worked in the, uh..."
"in the mills in Bethlehem, all right?"
Provided a decent living.
He took care of us.
Supported us.
Nothing lavish.
- Right.
"- So, one day, he gets a call into the big boss's office."
First time he's met him in 30 years.
"So, what did the boss say?"
Nothing.
Nothing?
What the fuck kind of story is this?
"You see, it's not about what the boss said;"
"it's what he didn't say, Joe."
Nothing blew up.
There was no victims that were brought out
Or--or dead bodies.
There was nothing.
I don't understand.
Nothing blew up?
That's the weird part.
"It was--it was like a bomb, only backwards, okay?"
"Instead of blowing out, it--it--it yanked everything in."
- Implosion.
- Artie.
Artie.
Did the sword do this?
"And if it did, can I reconsider this mission?"
It didn't.
And what you have to do is you have to get in that room
And tell me exactly what you see.
That's a look I don't know.
It's called the past rearing its ugly head.
"So in other words, the sword didn't do whatever happened at the embassy."
But you know what did.
"Oh, God, I hope not."
"- Artie, where are you going?"
"- No, no, I can't--"
"First, I have to..."
- Hey.
- Here we go.
Round two with Mr. Congeniality.
"Mr. Ogawa, look, we've answered all your questions,"
And now we have a few for you.
"Actually, agent Bering, I have one more."
Why does the secret service need to send two different units
- How do you know?
I used to be a homicide detective.
- Round up the usual suspects.
- Keep laughing.
It's a sin what he turned into.
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
We've got a dead nurse.
You stay right here.
Don't move.
"Absolutely, Dad."
I wouldn't want to get in the way.
Prick!
"Paula Puglusi, a nurse."
Same M.O. as the Putnam woman.
Guess who she used to fuck.
You knew her?
- Yeah.
"- God, Tom, I'm sorry."
Does that guy you were chasing have something to do with this?
- He was a witness.
- In the Polish Hill case?
I was one of the investigating officers.
Five women were strangled.
During the pursuit of the suspect my father was killed.
- Chicanis said he saw the killer.
- And you don't believe him?
This was the case where you lost your shield.
I lost my shield because I said a cop killed my father.
You want to give her one more pop before they take her away?
- I'll give you one more pop.
- Blow it out of your ass.
- Talk to the press for Uncle Nick.
"- First, you can't drive."
- Why not?
You can't drive your car.
Let him get some fresh air.
You're so pretty.
The princess on the pea.
Little mouse.
But you want to sleep.
I can see how tired you are.
Yes my love.
Lullaby and goodnight
With roses bedight
With lilies o'er spread ls baby's wee bed
"Tomorrow morn, if God deems"
You will wake from your dreams
"Tomorrow morn, if God deems"
You will wake from your dreams
- Do you recognize that sound?
"- Yes, mistress."
You know how much I love to pull you up on your balls.
"Oh yes, mistress."
- Ease it a little?
"- As you wish, mistress."
Or do you beg me to pull harder?
"Harder, please, mistress."
- I can't hear your.
"- Harder, please, mistress."
- And?
"- Please, mistress."
That's better.
- After all.
"- Thank you, mistress."
I am always scared that it might be too late.
I know that the path that I have chosen is wrong.
But when there is only one path left to be chosen the right and the wrong doesn't have any meaning.
The path that I chose following Avi's hunger and your tears that path took me to diverse destinations.
"Mother, I was a kid then."
I didn't know how difficult it would be to return from this path.
"Still, I didn't let my criminal activities affect Avi."
"Come back, Baba."
You have compensated more than you had to.
Return home now.
Take my oath.
"Take my oath, or I will slap you."
"Mother, shall I take your oath, your slaps, or food cooked by you?"
Eat the food first.
Come on.
- Mr. Kadar!
- Who is it?
- Where are you?
- l am here!
- Please come out.
- Just a minute.
"- Please let me see you, Government."
- Here is the government.
- Where are you?
- Here I am.
- What are you doing?
- l am counting the change.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
- How are you?
- l am fine.
- What brings you here?
Today one will left.
Didn't worked.
I think its out of range.
Take the car near the rally.
I think they know we are following them.
Increasing the speed.
"I am getting near, you make target."
Drive fast its getting late.
You don't know my nature?
Uncle?
Why its not working?
Bhai (brother) its on target should i shoot.
"Wait lets find out where's the diamond,"
Papa!
Yes!
"A man who is behind us, asking for side, should I give him?"
"Papa, tell him if he give him side, then car will come on the middle."
"Then how could we get the range, I'm telling you over take him,"
"One, Two Three..."
"Laxminarayan, it's your first murder, Shoot him,"
"For your mother's tears sake, Shoot him."
"Papa, he's escaping, No, Papa."
"I suppose to leaving you but to ask first,"
My I take a leave please?
Please!
No!
"Till he die, you can't leave from here, Follow him,"
I miss a lot still water and died grand mother.
What you looking at my face?
"We don't have to spare Yadav, Come on."
Dad!
Dad!
This is an emergency.
"I repeat, this is an emergency."
What's going on?
I don't know.
Andfastenyourseatbelts.
"I repeat, this is.."
"Sir, we're under attack!"
It's clear that someone on the inside has orchestrated..
this takeover of the White House.
That's the only way..
"Mr. Speaker, we have confirmation of ground impact."
"We're going to need to swear you in, sir."
What?
Executive power passed to the vice president when he was sworn in..
which means the office now passes to you.
Sir.
Please follow these men.
"Sir, these are your new presidential launch codes."
Please keep them on your person at all times.
I need a moment here.
I need..
I need to call my wife.
"Of course, sir."
Thank you.
Emily Cale.
How are you enjoying your tour?
Remember these?
"You and I have a date, sweetheart."
You'll have to go through me.
Really?
You're gonna go to jail for that!
And who's gonna make me?
Oh.
Would it be too much trouble if I could come... have a nice night.
Is the only evidence we found at the crime scene.
What can you tell us about him?
He was relatively clean.
He came and went without so much as a peep.
Any visitors?
Only for just an hour.
♪ let's make romance tonight ♪
♪ let's take a chance tonight under the light of the moon ♪
Looks like business is good.
"Hey, ray."
How you doing?
This is it... 424.
Check all the usual hidey-holes.
Hey!
Take it easy on the furniture.
That'll be all.
Thank you.
"All right, welcome to amateur hour."
"I got cash, passports."
"Got a british passport for ""alfred lean,"""
"An american passport for an ""orson hawks,"""
"And an italian pass-a-port for ""federico rossellini."""
We got a film buff on our hands.
What you got?
You find something?
"Well, it sure isn't nothing."
Powdered eggs again.
What am I paying for?
"Still, better than the blitz, right, english?"
"Oh, just barely."
"Hi, Daddy."
He was the one that got the license for this building.
Nice guy.
[Woman] You gave me a little bit of a scare... when you told me you had pains in your chest and back.
You have to let somebody know.
If you're having pains in your chest and your back-
In my chest that goes through to my back.
- Is that what's happening right now?
- Mm-hmm.
You know what?
"I think maybe I better take you back to the area, just to be safe."
- No.
- Are you sure?
- I'm
-Yeah -
- She might be pregnant.
[Laughing] How do you say-
She
- She says maybe you're pregnant.
[Laughing]
- That would be interesting.
- It would be a very good thing... if you would - if you would find me a really good husband.
It's already too late.
"If you're pregnant, it's already over..."
- [Claire] Oh.
"- I've seen you with a new young man around here, Claire."
I know that you do have someone new in your life.
- Oh.
- Do you remember that?
Memory is one of the things she hasn't got.
And I think his name is Albert.
"- Oh, Al..."
Why her?
Like there's not enough rich people on this island.
"She's away from home, out of her element."
Dawkins sees her as an easy target.
Whatever.
"I need everything on Dana, okay?"
"Travel itineraries, flights, car rentals..."
"Hey, guess what?"
"I've done this before, but thank you."
"That's it, matches the description of the car Dawkins stole."
"Five-0, we'll take it from here."
- What are you doing?
Looking for cash.
It's what Dawkins would have done.
Empty.
Says maybe he used whatever he found to buy something.
- Food or water?
- No.
Dawkins knows his face is all over the news by now.
"If he wants to get off the island, he needs to change his appearance."
- Coming in?
It's a men's room.
"That's the luxury of carrying a badge, kid."
You can go anywhere.
Lemonade mix and mayo.
It's old prison trick for dying hair.
- Seriously?
- Mm-hm.
Looks like our man's a blond now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
Fifteen minutes ago.
Factor in the time for a dye job and he couldn't have made it very far.
"..but it is meant for your child, but Im sorry to say.."
..that sister-in-Iaw doesnt have any child.
And however you might be related to us..
..but you are not our real brother.
"My friend, please come back."
"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
Come and look at my condition.
"Without you, all my happiness is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
You came to my Iife as my..
You came to my Iife as my..
You loved me more than my near ones did.

I pray to God that wherever you are..

"Without you, my Iife is incomplete."
"My friend, please come back."
"Brother, you are counting your money!"
How much money did you collect?
Nothing.
I don't know.
"I mean, maybe we've grown apart."
Maybe she'll be repulsed by my frosted tips.
I was gonna defrost them before I saw her for the first time.
- I'm sure it will be magical when you see her.
And... guess what?
- What?
- I'm done.
I've sewn myself up.
- Huh.
"- You did great, buddy."
I'm proud of you.
I can't believe I did it.
I'm so strong.
"- Ooh, we're crossing into Virginia."
Fun fact:
"Virginia is not technically a state, but a commonwealth."
"- Oof, poor Jake."
"- Uhh, this might be the Ambies speaking, but this in-flight movie sucks."
"- So, uh, you already moved the twins onto a booster seat, huh?"
Aren't they a little young for that?
- They're four.
"- Nikolaj is four, but we're sticking with the car seat as long as possible, but you know me--"
"I'm a ""safety at all costs"" kind of dad."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Sarge, I need to go to the bathroom."
- We just stopped for gas.
I asked you if you had to go.
- I didn't have to then.
- So does this van have side-impact airbags?
- Not in the back.
- Oh.
"There's some fucking guy, scientist or something."
Real sick bastard.
You listening?
Avidly.
"Says he measured out the remains, the cremated remains of a dead man."
"Measured out the minerals left behind, you know?"
"The iron phosphates, the..."
Whatever it is we're made up of.
Says he added it all up to the cost of $4.40.
You believe that?
"Yeah, I guess so."
$4.40.
"Burnt down man's worth less than a fucking Big Mac, all you can say is ""I guess so""?"
Says give this poor bastard what he's got coming.
Authentic?
Yeah.
Ten minutes.
Start the count.
"All eyes are on the newcomer, Rainer..."
Can I get you something?
Two shots.
Scotch.
Got money on the game?
"Nah, spread's terrible."
Here.
One for the road.
"No, thanks."
Been sober for three years.
Interesting career.
You do something long enough.
"You close your eyes, you just can't think of doing something else."
They found your accounts.
I will die.
and your God is my God.
I love you!
Everything this woman has is here;
she has nothing else.
I will do my best to get her a good price.
Jabesh.
That's no surprise.

Some of us have work to do.
Very well.
When a man dies...
Not another lecture on the law. the brother of the dead man should marry her and care for her.
Such are the commandments of God.

Excuse me!
and now she is left with nothing.
She comes before you now to sell all that she owns.

First up for sale is this poor widow's land.
Ten thousand shekels!

I like to help where I can.
What he'd like is to buy up Bethlehem and put everyone else out of business.

I think I'll have a little fun.

Twelve thousand shekels!

Twelve thousand going twice!
Twelve thousand and five shekels!
Fourteen thousand shekels!

"Look,I'm sorry."
But wouldn't that be kind of gross if that turned me on?
You look like a ten-year-old girl.
I feel like a pervert.
You got used to the Hitler.
"Well,the Indian pacifist just is not my thing."
"That says a lot about you,don't you think?"
"It's not right,okay?"
There's hair there for a reason.
"Oh,really?"
And what exactly is the reason?
I don't know.
"Maybe it's nature's way of saying,"
"""Hey,look over here."
... don'thavejurisdictionoverthis .
You be careful with that sign.
That cost a lot of money.
MAN:
We'll be careful.
MAUDE:
Bring it up on the left.
"Make sure that's well secured, now."
That's it.
That's good.
That's good.

"So, tell me, Mother, which con did you use..."
... onourrecentlydispossessed Swedish friend?
The floating king?
You're very good at that one.
There was no need to use sleight of hand.
That man's dumber than a shovel.
"Well, what do you think?"
"Frankly, of all the endeavors I thought you might undertake..."
... hotelproprietress was not one of them.
Why are you in town?
"Well, I just wanted to be close to my sweet little baby boy."
And look at you. I never thought you'd become a bartender.
"Owner, Mother."
I've become a man of commerce.
Madam.
May I have the pleasure of welcoming you back to our humble town.
"Why, thank you... ."
- Okay.
"So, just for fun, what would happen if I wasn't here on Monday?"
Has there been a horrible train accident?
No.
Train's here.
I'm just not on it.
It wouldn't be fun.
"Come on, what would happen?"
I'd have to make a phone call.
You'd have to make a phone call?
I would make a phone call.
- No fun.
- Company man.
Hi.
- How you doing?
- Good.
You should have seen your face back there.
What?
"When I didn't get off the train right away, you looked like you were about to have a heart attack."
- How was your weekend?
- Good.
"I had a great weekend, thanks for asking."
So you got that text?
Confirming the...
What I already knew.
"Yeah, I got it."
Did you get mine?
"I was trying to make a joke about the White House Correspondents' dinner, but my phone spell-checked it into whorehouse correspondents' dinner."
Spell-checks are usually pretty accurate.
Right.
I'm sure there's a whorehouse correspondents' dinner somewhere.
"Somewhere, yeah."

"To call his boss on the way so he can tell Hitler that it was all a dream or whatever he wants to say, but that I don't want to see them ever again, not even in photographs."
And if my boss doesn't want to?
Well then I'll just say two words.
Exactly.
His parents.
I'll send a team to eliminate them before they ever meet

"Go with them, immediately."
"You, Espínola, can return to Flanders."
And don't ignore your phone.
-Don't worry.
"You are Espínola, who conquered Breda?"
The very same.
It is an honor to fight alongside a Grandee of Spain.
"You are also great, although you don't have a title."

He doesn't accept the deal.
What did he say?
-Better I don't translate.
Let's leave here.
What a waste of cyanide.
"Go on, say what you want to say."
"If you're saying that because of Lola, do not worry"
I do not blame you.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.
And go to bed when I want to.
And when to kiss whenever the impulse gets over me.
"Allison, we all make mistakes."
"But if we face them, truthfully, they can be overcome."
Can we overcome the fact of my birth?
That I'm illegitimate?
I think so.

Thank you.
"And good-bye, mother."
"As soon as this trial's over, I'll take the 1st. train out of here."
"Good-bye, mother."
Court will come to order.
Everybody rise.
"Be seated, please."
The recess in the trial of the State versus Selena Cross is over.
"Gentlemen, you may proceed."
Prosecution wishes to call Joseph Cross to stand.
-Joey...
-I told you my name was Joseph.
Joseph...
"this morning, just before recess... we were talking about lying and telling the truth."
"Joseph, have you ever told a lie?"
"-Yes, sir."
-Big ones or little ones?
Some little ones and some medium ones.
"You'd lie to save your sister from prison, wouldn't you?"
"-Yes, sir."
-A big lie?
-The biggest lie you ever heard.
-I object!
Sustained.
What are you doing?
Really...
What are you trying to do?
I have something to discuss with her.
What would you want to talk to me about?
I'm unemployed!
It will just take a moment.
Have you gone crazy?
Ajussi!
"(Ajussi - older man, uncle)"
What are you trying to do?
You want to use force to deal with girls?
You...
Do you know me?
I don't know anyone who's like you.
"No, I am not the kind of person you think I am."
Don't interfere.
"Miss Kim Min Hee, please get out of the car."
What exactly are you trying to do?
This ajussi!
Really...
She's clearly in a car with another man.
"Whatever you want to do, shouldn't you consider the situation?"
It really is funny.
What's wrong?
Not leaving?
"Mr. Prosecutor, are you okay?"
Mr. Prosecutor.
These clothes will only cause people to misunderstand.
You mean they didn't know you are a prosecutor because of your clothes?
"There is enough evidence, right?"
We almost had them!
- Because I'm gay?
- No.
I didn't say anything.
He must have asked around.
But I didn't tell him.
I swear.
I have to go to class.
You can't make it to any teacher conferences?
"I can, I just need to reschedule for tomorrow."
You don't have to see all of them.
"You should meet her French teacher, Mr. Carinci and, oh, are you going to meet Ezra?"
- Ezra?
"- Ezra Fitz, her English teacher."
"Aria's crazy about him, and I can see why."
"He's very smart, he's attractive, sensitive."
Does he also play guitar?
"Uh, not that I know of, but he does know how to handle a loose cannon."
Today Nick McCullers showed up.
McCullers.
From the library board?
"The same one, with the very same paranoia."
He was about to launch into the gay agenda there in the cafeteria.
"Ezra totally calmed the waters, completely defused the situation."
- It was something to see.
- Mm.
I'm sorry I missed that.
You should meet him.
You'll like him.
I'm late.
"Listen, uh, Ella."
I thought maybe we could pick up where we left off.
Maybe next Friday?
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
Do say?
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
"Yeah, it's me."
"Whatever you are doing, you drop it."
Governor McCallum is going to Charleston.
Then he's touring that chemical plant in Point Pleasant today.
"Now, I want you to go down there... and meet him at the airport."
You listening?
"Yeah, McCal I um at the chemical plant."
Got it.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.
"John, are you there?"
Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
Great tragedy on the River Ohio.
I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.
Just think about this.
Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.
They show up over the chemical plant.
"Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me."
I'm talking about something bad happening at the chemical plant.
Then I get this message from this Indrid Cold... who's talking about a great tragedy on the Ohio River.
Guess what's on the Ohio River.
The chemical plant.
Today Governor McCallum is gonna be there.
I was on myway to interview him.
"Okay, it all comes down to Virginia."
"If O'Brien gets Virginia, he wins."
"- However, if we get Virginia..."
- We win!
"No, actually, Gary, if we get it, we tie."
- What?
- What?
"I don't follow these things that closely, but that's right, isn't it, Mr. Davison?"
Yes.
"Tie, like it's a tie?"
"You mean, we tie?"
- You do.
"- The real shock, Greg, is where this leaves us."
Neck and neck if the president takes Virginia.
"Matty, you'll forgive me if I sideline you here."
- Sure.
"- Dan, you know the president well."
What is going on in that Meyer hotel suite right this second?
The president has a lot of top minds working on her campaign.
They're gonna be all over this.
What happens when there's a tie?
Everybody goes online to try to find out what happens if we get a tie.
Way ahead of you.
"Shit, I'm just getting how to tie a tie."
Is there a book?

"Like, in a way, we were all Gina Linetti today."
"Gina, let's take this Gina to the hospital."
"Hey, how's the sheriff?"
"- Well, he keeps yelling, ""Disability for life!"""
So I think he's fine.
"Also, Coral Palms PD found your marshal at Figgis's hideout, alive at well."
"- Oh, that's great."
- Yeah.
How are you doing?
"- Fine--you know, just getting bandaged up."
"Actually, can you give us a second?"
Thanks.
It hurts so bad.
I just didn't want to seem weak in front of EMT Craig.
"- So I know this is weird to say, because I just shot you, but it feels like we're back in sync now."
"- Yeah, I mean, as in sync as I've ever been with someone who just shot me."
- I love you.
- I love you too.
"Hey, do you happen to know my blood type?"
- Yeah.
B positive.
"- Well, guessed wrong."
"Hey, Craig?"
"- Hey, Captain Stentley, we're back."
- How was Florida?
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.
"- Come on, man."
"- Now, before you say anything,"
I know we disobeyed a direct order.

"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.

Terrific.

"Walter, we got the information there's no shit on the street, right?"
It's like a desert full ofjunkies waiting to get well.
"Goddamnit, this could be it."
"This little candy-store guy, he's put on a big show... ..in a club with no narcotics connections."
They were all over him.
"And after working a day and night, we tail him to Brooklyn."
"And we sat on him for practically a week, and who do we come up with?"
Joel Weinstock.
Now you gotta let us have it.

"Me sleeping with someone, and you knowing about it?"
Better than not knowing.
I think.
This is Denise.
"44, software consultant."
"Most important, not looking to fall in love."
She just wants sex.
"You can do that, right?"
All the equipment's in working order.
I feel a bit like we're stepping off a cliff.
Here's hoping there's a trampoline at the bottom.
Donnie?
Simon.
"Look, avoiding my calls isn't going to work."
I need to talk to you about my father.
Don't make me hunt you down.
Oh.
Hi.
Sorry.
I-I was just about to knock.
"They're called ""roving bugs""."
It's a technique used to remotely activate a phone's mic and eavesdrop on the owner.
The FBI's been doing it for years.
Did one of the Seleção do this?
Dunno.
Micchon?
Any luck?
Got it!
"It's from No. 01. ""Request MPD to investigate Eden of the East."
What?
!
What does he want with Eden?
Takizawa-kun?
What's wrong?
Thought I bailed on you?
You had this poster in your other movie theater too.
Somehow it seems like they're linked to my movie-related memories.
What now?
It'll take some time for your friends to wire money.
I've got enough cash for us to take the Chinatown bus.
You wanna wander around the city for a while?
But-
I think I might've lived around here when I was a kid.
And I'm curious about that room...
Maybe I can find some proof before my past disappears forever.
"didn't you say ""it doesn't have a golden ring""?"
Did you mean...
This is Juiz.
Hey babe.
Something really neat's about to happen.
Do tell.
The son of the hardline party's leader is the culprit behind the missile attacks.
Have a good day.
"Uh, you won't be here."
I beg your pardon?
"Here, at 10:00 or 10:30."
Your date tonight.
Yes.
"The liaison in question is hardly a ""date,"" it's an appointment."
"Devon, she's a very beautiful woman."
"Yes, however she's also the widow of Wilton Knight, who, as you may recall, created and continues to fund the foundation for which we both work."
"Oh, I recall."
Yes.
"However, you're quite right."
She is a beautiful woman.
She's also a woman who never does anything without a purpose.
Devon.
"Elizabeth, how nice to see you."
You remembered.
How could I forget?
"Devon, you look absolutely wonderful."
And so do you.
"I believe, you used to say,"
"""living well is the best revenge. """
"Until someone comes up with a better phrase, I still do."
Gin and tonic?
You remember.
I'm so glad you phoned.
How long has it been?
Three years?
Three years and four months.
But who's counting?
I am.
I'm not telling you anything you didn't already know.
"But for right now, I'm free."
Once I get this ball and chain off my leg.
I'm waiting for my dad to take me to the courthouse for that.
I could drive you.
If you want me to.
So your mom didn't believe you when you said Leland was shady.
You don't sound very surprised.
"I'm used to that, that's why I called Syracuse University."
Talked to a lady at the school of architecture about how I was thinking of applying and did she know a James Leland.
You just called up and asked?
People love to talk.
And guess what?
James Leland went to S.U. And opened an office in town.
- See?
He's legit.
- Yeah.
He was a pretty good architect.
Right up until he dropped dead two years ago.
Introducing James Leland.
"Wait, my mom said his ID checked out."
Right.
"You ask a computer ""Is James Leland related to this Potter lady?"""
The computer says yes.
But you didn't ask if James Leland was still alive.
Knowing the right questions is better than having all the right answers.
Toby?
Mr. Dugan called with the good news.
Did you hear?
He told me.
We can get that awful thing off your leg right now.
The cab's waiting.
That's all right.
- What?
- For my father.
Don't tell him I was with you.
"Wait, wait."
I'll take you.
"- No, we're going to take the tram."
- When will we meet up?
In two days.
In the same place as always.
Will you think about me?
I will.
I'd love to show you the youth of today.
"You can't imagine how different they are... they're better, they have revolution in their blood."
If only Trotsky and Lenin had known that.
Trotsky was a filthy traitor.
"Imagine what your mother would say if she heard you talk that way... about someone you never met, and someone who has passed away at that."
Mund...
"Sir, I want to go to Munich."
What for?
There's food here.
"Doctor, my head hurts."
Do you have something?
"No, I'm very sorry."
I don't have anything.
"- The Geneva Convention, prisioner."
- Mund...
The gentlemen will say that they're in good health...
- there's nothing to complain about.
- This prisoner has appealed...
- to the Geneva Convention.
- He's got no case at all...
- that idiot refuses to eat.
Which list?
The list.
It's a tragedy.
They burned it.
What are you talking about?
What is that list?
A hand written sheet with names and dates.
It was here.
I saw it only yesterday.
I did not think that it was important.
"I should have called you, Fandor."
Calm down.
Try to remember what was written.
"Well, I only remember..."
"""Baroness de Vibray"""
"""April 5"" and..."
And then?
"And then, of course, my brother's name with the same date."
"Maybe ""12 April"" was written too."
I'm not sure at all.
Not a word to anyone about what just happened.
We're here to help you with the circumstances you are going through.
We know everything about your financial situation.
Indeed.
"Through us, you could sell some of your unfortunate brother's paintings."
"Yes, and if he is still alive, as I wish, he will be happy to know that his paintings were taken care of."
It is very kind of you.
I'm very grateful.
You're welcome.
You are very pale.
Are you sick?
"No, not at all."
Take these guys.
I'll get your ship back.
"No, no, no."
We're going to themaru.
At least that ship works.
I'm in a bad mood.
And we're out.
"Nothing nearby on sensors,"
Although local gravitational forces
And multi-Spectral energy readings
Are consistent with a solar system.
"Dylan, i can't find a slip-Point."
"Well, there's only one way"
To find a slip-Point
Force whoever's onandromeda
To make one.
"Beka, bring us around."
We're going to play a little game of chicken.
Here we go.
Let's see who flinches first.
"Rhade, bucky cables on standby."
Bucky cable range in three... two... one.
Bucky cables as offensive missiles.
Okay.
Bring us around for another pass.
Targetandromeda with whatever weapons we've got
And hit her hard.
You know i'm double billing you for this.
Huh.
Ship to ship.
This is captain dylan hunt.
"Surrender, and you won't be harmed."
What is this?
I think I might as well go to Provincial Office work.
Just go then.
"You will just waiting for sleepy children, right?"
It might be more tiring.
It's better here!
We will not fall asleep here!
Didn't you say there's no point protecting the president's daughter?
It's very annoying coming here.
I know you enough.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Watch her closely.
I think she will dance until she slips off.
Okay.
"Today, we're also going to a Hotel, right?"
But...
You didn't meet with the old man recently?
"The days you did not meet him, made me very happy too."
We broke up already.
Maybe something has happened.
Even his mobile number has changed.
He should have contacted me.
What?
Broke up already?
Why?
Weren't you allowing me to sort out my relationship?
The case is...
"Now that I think you aren't popular amongst the guys, I've lost interest."
In just one moment my taste changed.
What?
Let's break up too.
"Really, Eun Ah..."
You do look handsome in your sou'wester.
Really?
Gin.
Mr. Hilliard's going to be awfully angry.
"Oh, we'll blame war transport."
- The old ham can make do with me.
So...
Positions!
Positions!
Everybody please be quiet for a take.
Don't stand under any thousand-pounders.
The director wants to speak to you.
Let me guess.
He's canceling my fitting for the dog costume.
"No, he didn't say what it was about."
Tell him you couldn't find me.
But-
- But I have found you.
"No, you haven't."
You are exhausted.
"You're leaning against the rail of the ship, the wounded Johnnie cradled-- cradled in your arms."
"Oh, uh, no, thank you."
"You look up, and you see, coming towards you across the deck, a vision of loveliness."
And you say...
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
Careful.
The kid's pretty messed up.
He kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
Kept talking about some broad called Nancy.
I guess that must be you.
I guess that must be you.
Where you going with the time capsule ?
Home.
Unveiling it was supposed to be a special event.
The whole weekend's ruined.
"I mean, some things you just can't party plan."
"You know, actually, I'd like to see the contents if you don't mind."
At least someone will get to see the time capsule.
Here's the list.
We buried it underground right before graduation.
All our favorite memories.
"""Rubik's Cube, Atari 2600,"
"Whitesnake CD,"
"President Bush elected."""
"That's the first one, right ?"
"Dubé champagne."""
The same brand as the murder weapon.
The bottle's not in there.
"Did you take it out, Krystal ?"
"What do you mean, take it out ?"
No !
"Oh, my God !"
Our beach in a jar.
It broke !
That might be evidence.
Evidence ?
I'm confused.
Let me guess.
You brought it back from your trip senior year in the Bahamas ?
How'd you know ?
Are you the only one with a key to the time capsule ?
"Well, there's one other person."
Not that she ever cared about the class project.
- Or he wanted us...
"- Oh, man."
I remember that.
- He made me...
I smelled something.
- Everyone had to do it.
- We all had to do it.
- That's so right.
"And then, like, there were times where in the bathroom scene you were like, ""Girls, it's a great opportunity for like bathroom humor."""
"- Oh, my God."
"- And we were all like, ""What?"""
It was 5 in the morning and the three of us looked at you:
"""No, we're not gonna do that."""
I think it's relatable to an audience to witness someone else smell something bad.
"- Oh, God."
- It is.
Think about it.
I remember talking to you about this when you're like:
"""Why is it my instinct to make someone else smell something bad?"""
Right.
"And then inevitably somebody says, ""Here, smell this."""
Speaking of smelly things.
- How did you feel about this foot...
"- Oh, God."
- Nice one.
"- Oh, Alexis' foot, doesn't..."
- She's an extremely pleasant...
"- That's her real foot, right?"
- That's a stunt foot.
- Right.
"- No, that's really Alexis' foot."
- That's an Alexis foot.
- I know.
It's just that you...
This piece of junk is really badly designed.
Sorry.
You seem tired lately.
"As a lover of justice, you should understand... that I'm going through a difficult moment."
- Recent separation...
- Four months is not so recent.
"Right, it's not... but then there's my father's case against his latest wife."
The judge is going to rule this week.
Juan.
How is he?
He's all right... but I want him to stay away from all the dirt in the case.
"Welcome to England, Acacio."
Are you going to miss Brazil?
"Yes, I am."
And what do you think you're going to miss most?
Especially you.
What have you got to say to your new fans in Manchester?
"Hello, Manchester people."
I love you.
"Sorry to interrupt, but this is the fourth class that I've been at."
"Your grammar is perfect, but I disagree with the subject."
Really?
Gordo wants to change the program.
Wants.
Adapt the curriculum to Acacio's basic needs in England.
And these basic needs are?
Trash talk.
Yeah.
"The bad is good, teacher."
The English play an Anglo-Saxon-style soccer.
Where do you hail from?
Suburban narcotics squad.
Sick of smashing syringes?
You could say that.
"Klein is sulking, stay with him."
Don't chat with the enemy.
We're enemies?
"bri/OCU, it's an old rivalry."
- Aren't we a big family?
- So they say.
She's private property.
Klein's?
Who else?
How could you be pals with him?
He wasn't always like this.
Their names?
Winterstein.
Bruno and Rolf.
The one who did me was Bruno.
Christo warned me:
"""Your big mouth will get you in trouble."""
Now it has.
"7 vans in 1 8 months 9 conveyors slaughtered, and a 2 million Euro booty."
The Ministry of the lnterior sent us a memo.
"Asking us, and I quote:"
"""to tackle the problem head on"
"""and neutralize the criminals"
"""who've derided our forces for too long."""
"""Too long"" is bad!"
"Means we've been around for too long, doing nothing!"
As of today you're on duty 24 hours a day!
"Drop your personal problems, don't laze on Sundays, go out and nab that gang of fuckers before they strike for the 8th time!"
I expect they're dead now.
TARRANT:
It's a photocell lock.
Here's a key.
"Tarrant, wait."
Here's another one.
- What do you make of it?
- It's a Tangran code.
- That's what I thought.
- I wonder...
You just saved our lives.
- That other one must have been booby-trapped.
"- Yeah, that was a trick, tiny diffusers."
- Nerve gas?
- I expect so.
Let's just pray there isn't a backup system.
Ladies first.
You're so gallant.
In my hand I have an electrical contact.
"If it closes, it will detonate 700 kilos of glycerol trinitrate."
Put your guns away.
Put them away!
Nitroglycerine?
"It's a bit outdated, isn't it?"
It was all I could make with my limited resources.
And it is still a highly effective explosive.
"- You're not from the Federation, I gather."
- No.
Your surreptitious entry told me as much.
Who are you?
Where are you from?
"Come now, I may be friendlier than you think."
And my personal favorite is blaming the wife.
Pointing out all your little faults.
Leaving you to feel like you're the one with the problem.
"Do you just back into things and not look where you""re going?"
Look at that.
"That""s a serious..."
"You know how much that""s gonna cost?"
"- Maybe you""d be better off in a Chevy."
"- David, I work hard for my car."
A Mercedes was the first thing that let me know that I accomplished something.
I love my Mercedes.
"You should hire Bobbi, too."
Get some great stuff on Mike.
"You""ll need it when your custody fight gets ugly."
"I don""t want to fight with him anymore."
I want to be boring for a while.
"- I want to live a modest, uneventful life."
- What?
I met somebody.
Does this woman look familiar to you?
No.
And then he took me to a show.
Can you believe it?
And this has been going on for months?
Yeah.
"I couldn""t tell you because..."
"- he""s married."
"- He""s married?"
"But he hasn""t been in love with his wife for a long time."
"I mean, he""s only staying with her because of the kids."
They have kids?
"Well, three, but one of them is from his first wife."
- Ha ha ha!
"What, did he hop the gate?"
You came!
- I said I'd come.
"- I know, but you came!"
How could I miss it?
"Manny, the first member of my family"
- to ever graduate from high school.
- Wait a minute.
Don't you have a brother in Colombia
- who's a doctor?
- Yes.
"He just does orthopedic surgery, no brain or heart."
"Think of it... tomorrow,"
"I will watch you stride across the stage with a sash, like a rebel's bandolier telling the world ""No absents, no tardies."""
"Manny and I were gonna grill some steaks and drink some, um, beers."
"Thank you, Jay, but if it's all right with you,"
I would like to take Manny out for a special father-son celebration.
- Is that okay?
"- Ah, sure."
"I mean, he... made the effort to come."
Didn't have time to button his shirt all the way up.
But... go ahead.
Perfect!
The night begins.
But first... here.
(spritzing)
Walk through this.
(chuckles)
"I know that smells terrible, but I've never seen that man get a mosquito bite."
(singsong voice) There he is... the graduate.
"I have one word for you, Luke... plastics."
"If I get angry, I'll..."
...this is my weakness.
"If I don't find my patient, I'll not spare anyone of you."
"He's a doctor, why is he behaving like this?"
- He's not a doctor.
- Then?
He's the memory loss patient we were just discussing about.
When he was brought here...
"Tell me, who am I?"
"If you don't, I'll jump down..."
Who am I?
Where am I?
I know...
We were scared he may kill himself.
Now...?
Please...take one injection...
let me give you one shot...
We are now scared he may kill one of us.
- Why?
"That's what confusing us, why did he suddenly change like this?"
Somebody has influenced powerfully and changed him.
He has a patient also in our hospital.
Where did you go?
That is...there...
Bloody!
Do you know how tensed I was without seeing you for 2 days?
With the problem you have...
what's that?
- Memory loss.
Where did you go?
Forgot the hospital address and took time to come here.
"What happened, doctor?"
I don't see why.
Huh!
"What, you -- spend money?"
"Granville, I am t--talking about advertising."
You keep on about s--spending money.
I wish you'd w--watch your language!
"I may be old--fashioned, but I hate to hear young people t--talking loosely."
I haven't brought you up to be promiscuous over m--money.
-
"- True, I'll give you that."
-
- You've lacked for nothing.
That's right.
That's one thing I haven't lacked -- nothing!
I've had plenty of that!
You've always had good food and healthy exercise.
I know.
But what about boring?
It's often been boring.
"Well, I should hope so."
But look what it's d--done for your complexion!
-
"- You've got wonderful skin, our Granville."
-
"- I haven't done a lot with it, though."
Skin like that is entirely due to good old--fashioned English b--boredom.
"We used to be famous for it, a while back, all over Europe."
"""There go the English,"" they used to say. ""Aren't they boring?"""
"Mind you, we were always r--respected for it."
"Yes, but the world's changed."
And d--don't they know it.
Look what they get now abroad.
Let's go.
I look like Kermit the frog.
"Oh, God."
"Artie, stop doing that!"
"Yeah, I gotta tell you, Myka, those really bring out your eyes."
"This is a, uh, 14th century Chinese firework"
Known as an ice flower.
Very few-- very few like it left.
Now...
"Do not tell Mrs. Frederic that I did this, all right?"
"All right, we've got about ten minutes, more or less."
Let's go.
The light pattern triggers a feedback loop
In the optic nerve that mesmerizes the viewer.
They won't remember a thing.
Booga-booga.
"Whoa, freaky McFreakerson."
So it's some sort of reverse chemical reaction?
"Oh, yeah."
"Okay, take these off."
Just don't look directly through the window.
This was made by an implosion grenade.
It removes matter from the center of a space
And pulls everything-- Obviously everything--
Directly towards it with violent force.
This explains why they couldn't find the sword.
It could be in there.
"- Oh, no, no, no, no."
"No. the sword, long gone."
Stolen.
This was used by the thief as a cover.
- So the guy that I saw--
Thank you.
Oh!
Um... ?
please.
Please.
"For as long as you receive an article coaching fee, I don't see no objection your continuing to instruct him."
Fee!
?
Yes!
Certainly a fee.
I should be raising the matter with Mr.Baker today.
Is...is there anything else you wish me to discuss with him?
Uh...
Dress-room articles?
Or your intimate needs catered for?
"Sammy, once mentioned you do not like to share studio facilities with crew."
Electricians in particular?
Er..yes...ehuh...well one...one mustn't complain.
They do their best to make one comfortable.
"And as for the work...people seem to be responding rather well, so..."
"Uncle Frank, I look..."
look forward to your opinion.
Thank you.
Sometimes one simply has to be firm.
Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
Smelt of you for the longest time.
"Then one day, I went in there... and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
Lily...
"I understand you know, that things have changed."
And that I would like to put my name on you.
Oh!
"What's that, Larry?"
You want to show your appreciation somehow?
I suppose I could do that.
"After all, it would be rude of me to turn down a..."
"Oh, Larry, small but eager."
I'm going to need a serviette.
Hmmmm...
"Ah, thank God for rigamortis."
Councillors.
I eat you.
Brother.
Brother.
"I'm feeling really good, Sam."
Full of hope.
My spirit bear put me through an exercise program.
"Really worked my core, eh?"
"Good morning,"
I have and important announcement which will change the outcome of this trial.
Oh...
This may be very good for us.
I think we're gonna get a retrial.
"I'm beginning trust you, Sam Murray."
As you know someone has stolen my first and second-string gavels.
Now today my wife needs the hammer that I've been using as my third-string gavel for one of her projects.
Bird house.
"Which is all to say, you're looking at it:"
Today's gavel.
"All right, look, look."
It's just gonna have to do.
What a travesty this is turning into.
"Your honour, may I approach the bench?"
Yes.
Do you have a partner?
More or less.
I'm not alone anymore.
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
- Was her father here?
- Yes.
- He asked me if I was a faggot.
- You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
- What was my orientation?
- What did you say?
- That I'm into men.
- Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me if I like men or women?
- Who cares?
"- Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches."""
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
"As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps,"
"I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance."
"Oh, really?"
I'm from Playskool.
And I'm from Mattel.
"Well, I'm not really from Mattel."
I'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buyout.
You'd think they'd never seen a new toy before.
"Well, sure."
Look at him.
He's got more gadgets on him than a Swiss Army knife.
Please be careful.
You don't want to be in the way when my laser goes off.
"Hey, a laser!"
"How come you don't have a laser, Woody?"
It's not a laser!
It's a...
It's a little light bulb that blinks.
-What's with him?
-Laser envy.
"All right, that's enough!"
"Look, we're all very impressed with Andy's new toy."
-Toy?
-T-O-Y.
Toy!
"Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is ""Space Ranger."""
The word I'm searching for I can't say because there's preschool toys present.
"Gettin' kinda tense, aren't ya?"
"Mr Lightyear, now, I'm curious."
What does a Space Ranger actually do?
He's not a Space Ranger!
"He doesn't fight evil or, or shoot lasers or fly!"
I want my daughter.
"Agent Collins,"
Mr. Van Sciver will see you now.
Will you follow me?
"Sure, thank you."
"My mom is in that ambulance, let's go!"
What can I do for the FBI?
"Well, I'm just following up on a case."
What do you know about a young man named Zack Starr?
That name isn't familiar.
What about Krista Starr?
- His wife?
- Sister.
"I'm sorry, what is this about?"
"Zack Starr was murdered and the case was being handled by a local detective, a cop named Brian Boone."
Looks like Krista Starr was involved in the investigation.
"- Well, have you talked to her?"
"- No, she's missing."
"You wouldn't know where I could find her by any chance, would you?"
- Do you say Boone?
- Yeah.
Is this the same detective who is being accused of this cross country killing spree?
Yeah.
And you're handling that case.
"Well, it might be tied to the Starr murder."
"You think it might be 2 murders, him and his sister?"
No.
She isn't dead.
"In fact, her uncle saw her recently, just doesn't know how to get ahold of her."
- You spoke to the uncle?
- Uh-uh.
And he tells me that you and Krista know each other pretty well.
I feel like it's my job to tell you the honesty.
Nobody else has.
Nobody else can.
"It's rare to find these things out, and also upsetting."
These little glasses.
Let me see these things.
"Oh, yeah, we have the exact same affectation."
Mm-mmh...
Ah...
Emily.
Erm...
Seems like a less than ideal place to carry on.
Is it 'cause you have a girlfriend?
You mentioned her in an interview.
It's because it's gauche to grope and kiss in public.
"You really don't remember meeting me, do you?"
I had a photo shoot in that same place when my first book came out.
I gave you a copy of it.
"You acted like you were better than some first-time author nobody had ever heard of, even though you were probably still in college."
"I wrote my number in it, twice."
I really honestly don't remember meeting you.
"Sorry, but I remember you now."
"Oh, of course you do."
OK.
I'll call you.
(BICYCLE BELL RINGS)
ASHLEY:
Where were you?
Out.
"So, my meeting with Ike today..."
"Oh, so he's Ike now?"
- With Zimmerman.
Look at that.
Bobbies on bikes.
Everybody loves a bobby on a bike.
"Unfortunately, a million of extra bobbies on bikes couldn't deal with Jacob Gould."
"Operation Merlin couldn't deal with him, either."
What do you want from me?
You're going to kill him for me.
"- Niece and nephew, right?"
- Yeah.
"I haven't even got them any presents, though."
A bit behind on computer games and stuff.
Should've talked to me.
"CDs, DVDs, video games -"
Steve can get anything in that department.
"No, John."
That'd be irresponsible.
That's not their age range at all.
- How did it go with Lenny?
"- Pretty good, really."
He wants me to become an assassin for the state.
"- That's what you did in the army, right?"
- Wrong.
- That was legal.
- Yeah.
Then you whacked your aunt and uncle.
"- Shut up, Calum."
- I'm just saying.
"At least with Lenny you know it's someone who probably deserves it, not just some scared kid in a trench."
"I didn't fight in the trenches, Calum."
You wouldn't be going to see your sister if Lenny hadn't got you out of prison.
"- Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do it."
- OK.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defence that money can buy.
"Yeah, but, Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
It's on your head.
You're not supposed to double up on vitamin A.
It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
What happened to my masturbator?
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
I sense you're discussing my client.
Anything you care to share with me?
Sure.
Your commercials?
They suck ass.
I've seen better acting in an epileptic whorehouse.
Is that like the one your mom works at?
Is she still offering the two-for-one discount?
"DEA, huh?"
For a street bust.
"Now, what would two feds want with that little twerp?"
"Sooner or later, this was gonna happen."
You want your exponential growth guys are gonna get busted.
Simple as that.
How about we get him a real attorney?
What the hell is this?
- Yeah.
"- And you, just find out if anything unusual happened on the floor last 24 hours."
I'm taking all the new chips off the floor.
- Whoa.
That's big.
- You got a better idea?
- I can stick around and help.
- Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was getting through to you.
Go home.
Okay.
I'm gonna be here another 20 minutes.
I gotta meet my accountant.
Go home.
Okay.
Here.
"Hey, um, tell the cage, uh, we're gonna switch out the chips."
"Yes, all of them."
"Ed, it looks like the only counterfeits are hundreds."
"So, what's going on?"
We're just changing our chips... to get our players' feedback on our color combinations.
"- Well, I prefer burgundy and taupe."
"- And you, sir?"
Only color I care about is green.
Know what I'm sayin'?
"Ed, they took us for over a million."
Percentage of counterfeits stayed consistent.
"What, they have a million of our money?"
Million point two.
"Also, I looked into anything unusual on the floor yesterday."
"Only thing was a blackjack dealer, Jerry Smoltz, who was dealing 75% winners for three straight hours."
Two gyms and a cheese shop.
And he's going to Turks.
12C?
"Oh, my God, we're 12A and B."
"Oh, we'll be fine."
No.
You'll die.
Would it be awful to change seats?
Not as awful as composting right before you come to the airport.
Ugh!
"Okay, wish me luck."
"Jake, real quick."
The metabolism-- how does she eat like that?
"Pretty, isn't it?"
"Uh, oh."
"Yes, dear."
"It's just lovely, mm-hmm."
"It's lovely how it turned a one-hour drive into three, soaked a brand-new pair of my shoes right down to the toes."
Yeah.
Simply spectacular.
"Well, at least we'll be getting away from it for the holiday."
I'm going to Calgary.
"Ladies and gentlemen, due to the unexpected weather conditions, all incoming and outgoing flights are being temporarily delayed."
"Every effort is being made to clear the runways, but until the snow lets up, everyone get comfortable-- could be an hour... could be more."
Ooh.
Excuse me.
"Hey, I said excuse me."
"Yeah, I heard you."
"Is there a problem, sir?"
I don't know.
Is there?
"I heard my wife say ""excuse me"" just now."
I don't feel anything.
Put this in your mouth.
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.
"When the red light goes on, that's your temperature."
I don't want it.
A disorder of the nerves.
At least we think it is.
We don't know yet exactly how it works.
It's often seen in early adolescence.
She shows all the symptoms.
Hyperactivity.
Her temper.
Performance in math.
Yeah.
Why the math?
What is that?
It affects her concentration.
Ah-ha.
"-Now, this is for Ritalin."
-Okay.
Ten milligrams a day.
Is that a tranquilizer?
It's a stimulant.
A stimulant?
"My God, she's higher than a kite now."
Her condition isn't quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.
The Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition.
"And as to how or why, we really don't know."
"But, uh, her symptoms could be overreaction to depression."
That's out of my field.
Stop it!
Nobody... dislikes excitement!
Why are you following me?
"I have driven you a long way, you should invite me to your home."
What's the matter with you?
Why do you keep bothering me?
You can not escape from me!
Let me go!
Ride on!
- Who is that guy?
- He is a disgusting guy!
"If you hate him, why did you come with his car?"
You are right.
Poor me!
Everyday I face the dusty earth and burn below the sun!
"Dig and pant, dig again, plant again."
You have to study hard!
Hear me?
"Otherwise, you will end up like your sister!"
"The smooth completion of our project this time, relies on the efforts and contributions of everybody!"
"So today, is the time to enjoy!"
- Good!
- Great!
Come on!
"On behalf on the team,"
"I should thank our boss, Mr. Lin, for this long period he has been taking care of us!"
The next is... the miracle moment!
Kunlun...
the secret of lost martial.
The one-finger strike!
- Xiaotian.
- Yawang.
Any time you like.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
"I'll go along, Phil."
Keep the lad on the straight and narrow.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
Why not?
That's the way to investigate a homicide.
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Ruling out suspects, Warwick."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."
"Skip, a Mr Forrester on the phone for you."
He's got some information on Friday night.
He's got some information on Friday night.
"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
"I'm driving into town this way, right?"
Yep.
Yep.
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
"And as I approach the bend, I notice a car coming the other way."
White Ford Fairmont.
White Ford Fairmont.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"What, coming from Griffith?"
Yeah.
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it,"
"And just as I get to it, this other car comes screaming up behind it, pulls out right in front of me and overtakes."
pulls out right in front of me and overtakes.
Did you get the make and the model?
"EJ Holden, green with a white roof."
"He killed my client and tried to kill me, so there you go."
"Yeah, there's all kind of fucking motive."
I get it.
"But you got no prints, no blood, no weapon, none of that shit."
"So unless you're going to arrest me,"
I think we're done here.
Patty:
"No, so I thought I had more time this morning."
- Man:
Sorry.
- Patty:
Excuse me.
"So I decided to make breakfast like an adult,"
"And everyone saying ""Avocado toast, avocado toast,"""
so I'm there with an avocado in this hand and trying to get the pit out.
You call.
"The fucking knife slips, right?"
"And it slices me right fucking there on my middle finger, mind you, which I fucking need."
"And it's like four stitches, they're saying."
"And I think there's, like, seven to ten days, and then it's going to be fine."
[cough cough]
But I've never had to deal with that before.
Talk to me.
"Look, I'm-- I'm telling you, it's-"
- What's going on?
[muttering]
"Oh, my God, what's going on?"
What's going on?
Just talk to me.
Um... um...okay.
"Uh, I don't-- I don't know."
Um... do you-- How about a story?
"I said, ""Really?"
"You've seen Cliff 60 times?"""
"He went, ""Yeah, but I saw him when I was 11, and I'm autistic,"
"""so whoever I saw then, I just loved forever."""
"So, even Cliff's biggest fan is explaining away why he's a fan."
LAUGHTER
It's absolutely insane.
Can you tell me about the time you met the Queen?
The Queen?
Yeah.
"Oh, I know what you're after."
Do you remember telling this story?
"When you came on QI, you told this story and it really made me laugh."
"Yes, I did a Royal Variety show and I was..."
"Yeah, that's it."
LAUGHTER
"And, you know, you have to wait for ages in a line, and Her Majesty was proceeding graciously along, and she spent quite a long time talking to Frankie Dettori next to me."
And you know when you are aware that you've got a little bit of wind working its way through?
"And I thought, ""It's nothing to worry about..."
LAUGHTER
""".."
"I'll just deal with this silently."""
LAUGHTER
"And just as the queen got to me, the..."
"It was the moment, you know, where the wind was making a break for it."
"So, I let nature take its course."
"Unfortunately, I shat myself."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
But it wasn't...
"It wasn't a great big, you know..."
Sure.
No problem there.
Wow.
"Soul mate, right there."
"God's little gift to Landry, that's what that is."
Why can't you just be happy...
"Hey, Smash, you're on TV, homes."
And I want to apologize to him and everyone for doing so.
"Anyone can say, ""I'm sorry. "" Doesn't mean they are."
"Smash Williams is an arrogant, violent thug who attacked us just because we're white and have money."
And everyone's defending him.
He's lucky me and my friends acted civilized.
"And from the Smash Williams controversy, we go now to Kevin with the rest of today's sports headlines."
Smash?
"Hey, what the hell are you doing here?"
"Looking for you, man."
Did you see Adam Hughes on TV?
Do you want to respond...
"No, you're trying to get me in trouble!"
I'm just trying to get the truth.
"Hey, hey!"
"Tell him the truth, Smash."
Just shut the hell up!
Just shut the hell up!
"Smash, what happened that night?"
Was your sister hitting on him?
Is what he said true?
"Hell, no, that's not true!"
That's not true.
"All right, look, I'll tell you like this."
He was saying some foul things to my sister and I.
"Racial, sexual and threatening."
That's right.
But sometimes we're so focused on finding our happy ending  we don't learn how to read the signs.
How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't.
The ones who will stay from the ones who will leave.
- Hi.
- Hi.
GIGI:
And maybe this happy ending doesn't include a wonderful guy.
Maybe it's you  on your own  picking up the pieces and starting over.
Freeing yourself up for something better in the future.
Maybe the happy ending is just  moving on.
"Baby, what are you doing?"
It's our turn.
Forget the dip.
"Come on, come on."
MAN:
"Let's go, Alex."
"Come on, Alex, your turn."
Ready?
LOL.
Laugh out loud!
We won!
GIGI:
Or maybe the happy ending is this:
"Knowing that through all the unreturned phone calls and broken hearts  through all the blunders and misread signals  through all of the pain and embarrassment  you never, ever gave up hope."
NEIL:
Now that we are married...
BETH:
We're gonna move.
Gonna move.
That's one thing we're gonna do.
Another thing we're gonna do is move a little further away from...
- Baltimore?
She might even... thinks she'll keep you alive for some silly reasons.
Kids...
"- May I ask you a question, Violet?"
- You may ask.
You ever miss the doll house?
Not particularly.
"And I think I know what you're driving at, mister."
"But this job never got to me, aside from the sensational rush to the action."
- What about those men?
- What men?
The ones you killed.
"That, was fucking magical."
Did you see that?
"It's a bit early to know, but career wise... that little miracle might be my Monalisa."
If not my Billie Jean.
- Actually...
- Do you have any family?
What?
Do you have any family?
- What a random question.
"- Well, do you?"
Daisy is like family.
You didn't answer the question.
I got a father somewhere.
What's with the interview?
When's the last time you and he spoke?
- What do you care?
- That long huh?
- Are you afraid of what's next?
- Me getting shot?
I mean after that.
I haven't thought about it.
WOMAN:
"Oh, my God."
It's okay.
Come on!
I'll take care of you.
Come on.
MARY:
It's okay.
Keep coming.
I'll take care of you all.
Come on.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Keep coming.
I'll take care of you.
Come on.
( laughs )
ALLIE:
Miss Crawford.
I'm ready to go with you now.
Little girl...
I love the way your mind works.

The Conquest Of The Pole
The conquest of the North pole Fantastic aerial journey over north sea and north pole.
Fantastic film in two parts.
Part I
The scholars of the whole world meet to discuss a means for the reaching of the north pole.
A delegation of Suffragettes seeks to interrupt in vain the serious work of the meeting
"The meeting selects the committee, which will have the honor to take in the marvelous airplane of professor Klaps Platz"
"The professor demonstrates his flight apparatus, which is to reach the glaciers of the north pole"
"Would you be disturbed, or would you welcome it?"
Is that a special move I'm not aware of?
"Tell me, does it feel... does it feel tight, is there reverb?"
"Whoa, wow, we, uh, we can come back."
"Oh, no, no, no, I was just trying to see if my butt had changed since college."
"- Well, this is 40."
"- Oh, God."
"- Hi, baby girl, are you hungry?"
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Dive in.
- Ahh-ooh.
We got some carrots.
"Uh, hey, Mags, might I have a word?"
"Uh, yes, you might."
"Well, it's been approximately six weeks since we took Joanie and Cha-Chi to the carwash."
- Are you talking about sex?
"- Geez, Maggie, the baby..."
What?
"That's how she got here, right?"
"Anyway, since that wonderful night, I've been feeling..."
"Oh, no, no, hey, Bruce, we talked about this, right?"
- It was just the one night.
"- Oh, no, no, it's not that."
"- It's, uh, I met somebody."
"- Oh, okay, good."
"- I mean, that's great, yes."
"- Her name is Nancy, and it's been fast and furious, like the first movie, not the other seven, which I feel don't hold up."
"- Okay, Bruce, focus."
"- Anyhow, um, I really want Charlotte to meet her, but I was that maybe before she meets her that you might meet her."
- I'd love to meet her.
- Servalan?
- I thought you said she was dead.
- TARRANT:
We did.
- But she's not.
She's very much alive.
"- You tricked me, Forbus."
"- No, Sleer, I assure you."
You did something to that last batch of Pylene-50.
I did nothing.
Nothing at all.
"Look, let me show you the test sample."
I'm going to cut off your drug supply for three days.
- That means you'll die about another 10%.
"- Oh, no."
"Please, don't do that."
"- Look, this is the test sample."
- I told you... (Groans)
I'm not interested.
"I'll teach you to obey me, Forbus, if I have to destroy all your skinny little body."
"If you need a witness, Commissioner, I can swear it was self-defence."
What are you doing here?
I followed you from the concourse.
Those two off-worlders seemed very anxious to find you as well.
They seemed to think they recognised you.
Really?
"And of course, Practor recognised you as well, didn't he?"
That's why you killed him.
"- What do you want, Leitz?"
- The Presidency.
Anything is possible.
"Well, after all, somebody has to take Practor's place."
"And to go unnoticed, we created a whole new language."
"Words were numbers, and numbers were words."
- Plus 17.
- Magazine.
- Plus 6.
- Gun.
- Plus 15.
- Paycheck.
Plus 12.
Is this chemistry review?
- Plus 14.
- Ring.
- Plus 16.
- Sweet.
Use it in a sentence.
"Man, that sugar's sweet."
"Because I knew the count, I knew which cards were left in the deck."
That's how I knew what to bet.
You're doing great.
"Micky, I just want to let you know that I'm only doing this for medical school, which is $300,000."
"I mean, if I can get anything close to that, then I'm done."
"Well, in the first place, Ben, it's not ""if,"" it's ""when."""
"And second of all, I get it."
I completely understand.
- You do?
- Yeah.
It's a means to an end.
"Look, they've got this new computer software that reads people's faces, so who knows how long this gig's gonna last for any of us?"
What if we get caught?
"Our system keeps us under the radar, you'll see."
"Anyway, counting cards isn't illegal."
"- So, there's no danger in it at all?"
Especially her own. (LAUGHS)
"No, this is more of a general grief... about everything."
Love is a farce and everyone dies.
See?
Especially in our family.
Look at Mum?
"I'm sorry, have you lost your mother as well?"
"No, she lives in a house-truck near Stafford."
Denise had a change of heart.
Mum turned lesbian and Dad cried for a year.
Now she's with a man again.
George doesn't need to hear about any of that.
How can we help our esteemed new editor today?
"I'm actually not feeling that esteemed, Monty."
Welcome to my world.
I want to apologise.
"Well, look no worries."
You're welcome.
Job didn't mean that much to me anyway.
I meant to Bill Jr.
"Oh, what for?"
For being the one to tell Lindsay.
That should have been his to do.
You would have done a much better job than he would've.
I'd still like to talk to him anyway.
Do know where I can find him?
Mm-hm.
I can do better than that.
"Siouxsie, cancel my appointments for the day."
You don't have any.
Excellent.
He likes the way the balls roll across the grass.
I'm fine.
Your son is arrived from London.
- Father...
- John...
You will see in my will the estate of Norland was left to me in a way -
- That prevents me from dividing it between my two families.
"Norland, in its entirety, is therefore yours by law."
And I am happy for you and Fanny.
"But your stepmother, my wife and daughters are left only 500 a year."
Barely enough to live on.
Nothing for the girls' dowries.
- You must help them.
- Of course.
You must promise to do this.
"I promise, Father."
I promise.
Help them?
What do you mean?
"I mean to give them 3,000."
The interest will be an extra income.
- The gift will fulfil my promise.
- Without question.
More than amply.
One had rather.
On such occasions.
do too much than too little.
"Of course, he did not stipulate a particular sum."
"What do you say to 1,500, then?"
What brother would be so kind to his real sisters.
Let alone half-blood?
- They can hardly expect more.
Baby's gotta be with his mother.
How old is he?
Eight months on Friday.
I'm gonna give him a birthday present.
# Happy birthday to you ##
Hey.
Hey.
What's this I hear about a baby being back here?
Don't look at me.
Noogie's out of town.
"Mr. Nello, it's just for tonight."
Please?
I couldn't find a babysitter.
"Look, you've got 15 minutes to find one... and be back here in a tutu and on the floor."
Cut her some slack.
What the hell are you doing here?
Babysitting.
"for those of you who don't follow the Nobel Prize, I'm Morty Price."
"But seriously, I would like to thank right now..."
Mr. Cannata and Mr. Doss for bringing me back to glorious Miami.
"In fact, I was so eager to come, I turned down a chance... to be an extra in Coma Part II."
Not bad.
What?
"Not great, but not bad."
You ought to bottle his jokes and sell them for sleeping pills.
"I know it's hard to believe, I used to work in the stock exchange... till one of the brokers told me when my IQ hit 20, I should sell."
I really appreciate you helping me out.
This job is really important to me right now.
Better cover those.
You got husband troubles?
Not anymore.
I left him.
"It just contains pertinent medical data, family histories, you know, stuff like that."
Everything but a mix tape.
How would you characterize your marriage?
Perfect.
Fantastic.
"Well, let's start with something easy, then."
What's your favorite thing about your partner?
Uh...
She's a good mom.
He really is a great dad.
And where did you meet?
School.
High school.
High school.
Yeah.
She was a cheerleader
- I was on the football team.
Fullback.
"I coach now, but I used to play."
And we had...
We actually had our daughter...
We...
"On prom night, we conceived Lacey and it was a little confusing at the time, but it's been a blessing."
It's been the best thing that's ever happened to us.
It's been the best thing that ever happened to us.
We did the right thing.
How often do you have sex?
"She wants me to be tougher, screw harder."
"Work less, but bring home more."
I can't keep this shit straight.
"All I know is, whatever I do, it's not good enough."
Mmm.
What shall we talk about?
Alright.
Take it up.
Easy!
You're a stubbornness that girl.
You like her too much I think.
Your methods of archeology are too primitive for me.
You would use a bulldozer to find a....china cup...
"Colonel, wake your men!"
Indy the torches are burning out.
We got to get out of here.
Sallah!
"Hello, hello!"
"Why, Dr. Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?"
"Why don't you come on down here, I'll show you."
"Thank you my friend, but I think we are all very comfortable up here."
That's right isn't it?
Yes we are very comfortable... up here.
"So once again Jones, what was briefly yours is now mine."
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.
You're about to become a permanent addition to this archaeological find.
Who knows?
"In a thousand years, even you may be worth something."
"Ha, ha, ha, ha... son of a bitch."
I'm afraid we must be going now doctor Jones.
Our price is awaited in Berlin.
"But I do not wish to leave you down in that awful place, all alone."
"Slimy biff, you let me go!"
Stop it!
Aaahh..
Marion!
Hang on!
- I will return another time.
- Don't go.
You haven't visited me for a long time.
Forgive me.
My health has been hateful.
Franz is away.
"All the royal houses of Europe have invited him to play, it seems."
Even Russia.
"Like most peasants, he has a weakness for crowned heads."
You may turn around.
Please sit.
Thank you.
Do you hear anything from Madame Sand?
- Will she be coming to Paris this year?
- I am no longer her friend.
She severed herself from Franz and me with no explanation.
"- You have her latest book, I see."
- Yes.
- Have you read it?
- I wouldn't touch such trash.
"Madame, last summer you gave me a letter."
"Yes, I took a chance... you would forgive me speaking the truth of my heart."
"In fact, I was appalled."
But I could not reject it entirely.
Something touched me.
"A phrase, like a tune one can't forget."
- Shall I remind you what you wrote?
- Do.
"""I am not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
Imagine my surprise when I found that here.
No.
No?
This game has gone on long enough.
Those are crucial operating personnel.
You can't--
I can do anything I want.
[ Communicator Beeps ]
"Captain, receiving a transporter signal."
Transporter signal?
What does he mean?
You must tell me!
"It means, Trelane... the party's over, thanks to Mr. Spock."
Wait!
I won't have this!
I haven't dismissed you yet.
Stop!
I won't have this!
Everyone to stations.
"Report, Mr. Spock."
How were our scanners able to penetrate that radiation field?
"They didn't, Captain."
Not clearly.
We beamed up all life-forms in a given area.
"Which means Trelane is not a life-form, or he'd be beaming through now."
Prepare to warp out of here at once.
"Oh, Captain, I was so worried."
"Scotty, we're going to need every ounce of your engines."
We're going to put 100 million miles between us and that madman.
"I'm quaking, but from laughter or terror?"
What was it?
What was down there?
"Well, it was a--"
- Try to fatten me up?
- What if I am?
Suppose I wanted blueberry.
You had that last night.
"You don't fool me, Trevor Reznik."
I have you figured out.
"You do, huh?"
What else do you know about me?
That you are lonely.
"When you work graveyard as long as I have, you get to know the type."
"Hey, everyone gets lonely, Trevor."
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
"How can I be lonely, when I have you to keep me company?"
"Check, please."
"Yo, Reznik, Furman's office."
Now!
"How are you doing, Reznik?"
What's this about?
Frankly I am concerned about you.
"To be honest, I think you look like toasted shit."
I've had a lot on my mind lately.
- Anything we can help with?
"- No, thanks."
There's nothing I can't handle.
- Wanna see the doctor?
"- It is not necessary, I'm fine really."
"Are you doing drugs, Reznik?"
Where is the shop steward?
He couldn't make it
- Shouldn't even be in here without a union.
- See what I mean.
"Look, Trevor, I understand how you feel, believe me, but there's absolutely nothing to worry about."
"-Oh, bless you for that lovely inspiration."
"Oh, my baby, my baby."
would you Iike some pop?
Honey.
Pop?
Not with my nerves tonight.
"Scotch for me, please."
Grape.
You haven't asked me how I got away from school before the spring term ended.
I thought you'd volunteer that information if you wanted to tell me.
-You thought I'd been fired?
-No.
I thought you might have resigned.
"Oh, I was so exhausted by all I'd been through, my nerves broke."
"I was on the verge of lunacy, almost."
So Mr. Graves--
Mr. Graves is the high school superintendent.
Thank you.
He suggested I--
I take a leave of absence.
I couldn't put all those details into the wire.
This buzzes right through me and feels so good.
-would you Iike another?
-One's my limit.
You haven't said a word about my appearance.
-You look just fine.
-God love you for a liar.
daylight never exposed so total a ruin.
But you-- You put on some weight.
Yes.
You're just as plump as a little partridge.
It's so becoming to you too.
Do you want her to get raped and murdered?
Of course not.
You sure?
'Cause this is America.
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.
Then stop fucking with me.
This is serious.
She's adorable.
So you guys are fucking fugitives?
It's just it's Kumar's fault.
If we get out of this... the chances of us remaining friends is highly... highly--boobies.
Yeah.
"Hey, what do you think you're doing?"
Put that back on.
And keep it on.
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?
Yo.
What are you guys talking about?
Roldy was just letting me in on your situation.
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.
What about that fuckin' time we had to cover for you... lie to your ex-girlfriend about how you got crabs?
"You owe us, man."
"- Yeah, that's right."
- What?
"- OK, that was a long time ago."
- I love crabs.
Speaking of ex-girlfriends... isn't yours getting married or something?
How does everybody know about this except for me?
Wait.
You'll leave her alone?
- Yeah!
Meltem said you know me?
"Yeah, we have a mutual acquaintance."
This is getting exciting.
I know your father.I'm his partner.
Shit.
"- Hey, don't worry."
I'm here alone.
Let me go.
"Let her go, will ya!"
"- Shut up, okay?"
I'm not going back.
- You know you're father's almost cracking up.
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh man.
Shit.
Want some chewing gum?
"Here, they make the best bubbles."
What kind of cop are you anyway?
A new reform-oriented generation.
We're civilian friendly and practise painless police brutality.
Hey?
Are you gonna tell me what happened back then?
I heard about your mother's accident.
My father totally cracked up.
He just couldn't understand why it had to happen to him.
"There was always a reason, a motive."
"Hey, I got so sick of hearing that crap."
Then he started observing me even more than ever.
He'd secretly watch me on my way home from school...
"I didn't want to run away, but he nearly smothered me with his love."
"See, this gentleman thinks that we should comp his room... because it was haunted by a ghost thief."
- Delinda!
- Wolfgang!
What a surprise to see you.
Ed.
"Hey, Wolf."
We weren't expecting you until tomorrow.
I wanted to get here early to make sure everything is perfect... for the grand opening tomorrow night.
"""Wolfgang Puck at the Montecito."""
"Has a good ring to it, don't you think so?"
I think so.
Wow.
Just rolls off the tongue.
"Ed, let's go."
Where we going?
- In the kitchen.
- [Delinda] I so don't need this right now.
"On top of Wolfgang's opening tomorrow,"
I get a tip the health department's inspecting Mystique this week.
- [Danny] Don't worry.
You'll be fine.
- Pay up.
You heard her.
So you gonna pay your bill and leave nicely or is this gonna get ugly?
[People Cheering] There you go.
Can you believe this guy actually thought he was gonna get a free room by saying it was haunted?
"He said the ghost was a dark-haired woman, right?"
"Uh, no."
I think he said the ghost was a ghost.
Oh.
Maybe it was Monica.
"What, stopping dine-and-dashers from the great beyond?"
You never called.
What's wrong with you?
He is in deep shit.
You don't even know him.
His family doesn't accept him.
I can't leave him here.
I don't understand why this should be your business.
He will be saferwith me.
"""German rescues gay lover from radical Islamic family..."""
Perfect!
Have you gone nuts?
"Not only that, I love him."
Why don't you adopt a gay boy from all nations of the third world?
You could build a rainbow community.
I can't abandon a person in need.
Those kids in Afghanistan were going to die anyway.
There was a war going on.
I didn't even speak the language.
I shouldn't have pushed forthose pictures.
You could have stepped on those mines yourself.
I'm the one who lives with this every day.
There're mines everywhere.
I can't keep doing this.
"If he everbreaks your heart, don't call me."
What's up?
She won't stop.
She starts calling at 5am everyday.
I'm really sick of lying for you.
Is it worth it?
What are you hiding?
"Whatever it is, just be brave and come out with it."
They delivered this yesterday.
I did for a good reason.
But it has gone wrong.
Let Manoj's deal get finished.
I'll give your fair share.
"Only if we are united, we can cheat others."
"If we cheat amongst ourselves, we will not prosper."
Got it?
Don't share this with uncle.
I'll draft a plan for Manoj and let you know.
Let's go to the hospital and then leave.
"In the route from Kanyakumari to Nagercoil, these 3 trees are our mark."
You wait here.
I'll give a missed call while I come close...
You set a scarecrow looking like a human in the middle of the road.
"I'll hit the scarecrow, and act as though I'd hit a man."
Then you have to lie on the road like a dead man.
Definitely he will get scared.
He will try to run away from the spot.
"Then you clear the spot, and leave the place."
The plan is perfect.
"Hey, please..."
"Ashwini, what happened?"
!
What happened?
Tell me!
Ashwini!
What happened?
Where are you?
"Ashwini, where are you?"
Ashwini!
"Ashwini, what happened?"
"He's dead, Manoj."
"-Yeah, I'm romping in the fields now."
[KNOCKS]
ROBERTS:
Hey.
"This won't take long, Roberts."
"M.E.'s finding was suicide, right?"
He didn't have doubts?
I read the report on the Santini case.
I talked with Sipowicz and Kelly.
I also read her diary.
That's pretty sad reading.
"I never actually gave her any drugs, right?"
What I read in that diary made me sick.
"Lieutenant, let's remember she was a junkie, huh?"
-lt's not like you can take their word.
-You took control of a weak...
"... suffering,dependentperson."
You beat her.
-You made sexual use of her--
-But I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her.
"Which is what I understood this inquiry to be all about, right?"
"I mean, you don't see anything criminal coming out of this, do you?"
-You put in for retirement.
-l need three years for full vesting.
Today!
I don't care what you lose in vesting or in benefits.
I won't have you in this precinct or pass you on.
You fight me...
... I'llturnthepackageover tolad with a recommendation to dismiss.
I'm gone.
Fancy iced me.
Told me he'd smear me if I fought him.
I have detailed two of my units to General Gómez.
- We are too weak to...
- Are you afraid of a bandit?
I am a soldier.
Please don't forget that.
It would be insane to underestimate a man like Carrasco.
"Without reinforcement, I can't perform my duty."
"Señor Presidente, what about giving me part of the militia?"
- You can't have anyone.
- Why not?
- I need them to fix your mistakes.
- That's enough now.
That's enough.
This won't get us any further.
"That's enough, Silveira."
"- I'll think about it, General."
"- Thank you, General."
Señor Presidente.
"He's a coward, but he knows what he wants."
"And, most of all, he wants power."
"And you don't, dear friend?"
That will be them.
All right.
"There's no need for me to worry, is there?"
You have inspected everything?
- Read this.
- What is it?
What has Carrasco got to do with that village?
- We'll claim that it was him.
- And set the people against him.
I see.
"Silveira, I don't care how you do it, but I want you to get rid of this man, is that clear?"
I thought we agreed --
"Listen, sister, if I'm gonna be living in a hut in the Dominican Republic,"
I at least need a decent bottle of scotch.
I believe that's the sound of my scotch arriving.
"Hey, beautiful."
Thanks for coming.
I'm sorry it took so long.
There was construction.
It slowed everything down.
Construction?
Where?
At the entrance to the marina.
What?
Is -- is there a problem?
There's a reason fugitives are so paranoid.
"When you're on the run, even the smallest change in your environment can put you on high alert."
"But, then again, sometimes being paranoid pays off."
Damn it!
That's an earpiece!
"See, this is bad."
Those are agency guys.
We're blown.
"Yep, that's a gun."
My I.D. guy -- he was acting all jumpy.
Kept asking if he could deliver the passports himself.
I should have known.
They'll start searching as soon as they block the marina.
We got to go now.
"Well, we aren't getting out of here by sea."
Coast Guard is incoming.
"Fi, get Mike and Jesse."
I'm on it.
We have a problem.
The Ibani hotel?
They just cancelled our party.
And Jimmy Valenti changed his mind.
Nothing's been signed.
There's really no recourse.
A hundred guests have confirmed and we have no place to put them.
"I understand you're a bachelor, Neil, but for God's sake don't let the place go to seed."
So I've been scrambling to find a backup location.
You must have connections.
Somewhere discreet.
I'll see what I can do.
There's another matter we need to discuss.
This is my biggest party of the year.
We're all going to have to multitask.
"Darling, it's just business."
Is that what you call it?
'Cause to me it looks like blackmail.
"Look, Mommy and Daddy are playing house again."
The dining room table?
Bravo.
Is this gonna take long?
We were kind of in the middle of something.
"I just want a few minutes with your husband, Grace."
Like so many women do.
Coffee?
Mmm.
Love some.
She's never gonna stop.
Ever.
Today it's the SEC shutting down Bastion.
Tomorrow it'll be something else.
Now I want to return the favor.
What do you think that is?
"No idea, but, you know, we should probably bag it and search for Amanda's prints."
"Abbs, I think we may have found something."
"Me, too."
I found Amanda Kane.
I downloaded the onboard surveillance footage from the last cruise.
I found her wandering through the casino.
The guard's coming back.
"Abby, send me what you've got now."
"Hold on, wait."
It looks like the fiance on land did have a rival at sea.
Amanda met a man on the ship.
The guard's at the door.
"Abby, get out of there now."
Do we have an I.D. on our shipboard Romeo?
"Not yet, but I ran the fingerprints on the lucite tube."
They're Amanda's.
"Guys, check out the body language."
She's not in love.
She's afraid.
Got him.
Our mystery man is Roman stone.
He works here on the ship.
Casino croupier.
Maybe Amanda was tracking an illegal gambling operation.
- Roulette.
It figures.
It's a punk game.
- Sounds like you speak from experience.
Strictly a Texas hold'em gal.
That puts you in the leadoff spot.
Why did he stab him under there?
"Well, according to Shrimpton, Lorton stabs the kid here."
Shrimpton then heroically runs for help.
Lorton then drags the now dead body over to here.
Makes no sense.
It's closer to the street.
Why would you put it in a place that's lit up like the SCG?
"Now, your father was in the diplomatic service, is that right?"
David's told us all about you.
Very proud of his wife's exotic background.
We're not married.
Where exactly was he stationed?
All over.
"Italy, Spain, we ended up in Peru."
"Bloody hell, no way."
Peru?
That's where my brother-in-law was stationed.
Bob!
"Oh, this was many years ago."
"Yeah, ten years ago he was there."
"Bob, you great deaf bastard."
Come here!
"Oh, my phone."
"Oh, excuse me."
"If I was Joe Average instead of Joe Sandilands,"
I wouldn't be voting for us.
"I'd be buying a gun before Davo here bans them,"
I'd be putting a fucking bullet in my head.
"I think you've had enough there, Joe."
"No, Wal, Wal, I've only just begun, brother."
This man here is exactly what this party needs and we need 20 of 'em and we need 'em bloody quickly.
(Mobile phone rings)
"Look, I'm like you, Mom."
Worried sick how Ruby's gonna feel when her teacher dies and her grandmother goes to prison all in the same week.
Tell Ruby I'll call her later.
"Mom, stay away from the District Attorney's family."
Okay?
"This time, the horse comes back, he's got a blond that's like 10 times hotter than the brunette, right?"
"And the bandit's like,"
"""Okay, cowboy, you got one more wish, then you die."""
"And the cowboy's like,"
"""I think I better talk to my horse again."""
"He goes, grabs him by the ears, and he goes,"
"""You dumb lousy animal!"
"I said posse!"""
"Well, I guess what happened is what every reporter dreams of... being in the right place at the right time."
"Or the wrong and the wrong, in this case."
And will the police be questioning you as a witness to the murder?
Revenge killing.
"And, yes, I think so."
Which would be a good reason for us to stop right here.
- We good?
- Yeah.
- That's great.
- Thank you.
"- Appreciate it, Laura."
"- Thanks, guys."
Thanks.
Hey.
"Hey, angel."
That looks great.
What's going on with you?
And don't tell me everything's fine.
There is nothing.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up.
Maybe I'm all messed up in you.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
This is the only time I really feel alive.
I think being on stage at Woodstock was good.
"At that time, I thought we did good."
My opinion of the show was this :
it was obviously fucking chaotic.
You were going off.
"The fucking music was like, sloppier than usual I felt."
"Yeah, that was one of the best show I ever done, personally."
"I connected, I said fuck it and I didn't get tired..."
I broke everything I could and it was an insane show.
Fuck it.
I felt as if the world...
the weight lifted up off me.
I felt just relieved...
But...
"then I heard the tape, it was awful."
"Live, I think, anger becomes a main source of energy to get off of."
The shows become very disorder(impossible a piger?
--dissolved ?
BIZARRE?
)
The lights look amazing...
that's another story.
"Ah, I don't really want to do it, but."
"The one who brought back the Bonheur chocolates, was this boyfriend."
The guy you're spending tomorrow's Valentine's Day with is him.
"That guy smokes, right?"
"What, so you had noticed."
"If that was the case, you should have said something earlier."
This girl.
This girl is...
It's okay!
It's fine to go on like this!
What?
Two-timing is fine.
"If that boyfriend takes off for some place again,"
I'll help Saeko-san pass the time.
It's fine like that.
What's wrong with it?
- What?
I'm totally fine with it.
"Or rather, I don't mind it much."
"If I can be with Saeko-san, and one day, be loved properly, then I'm fine with that."
It's fine even if that's far out in the future.
"So, okay?"
I'm sorry.
"Saeko-san, wait."
"If you feel even a little sorry for me, at least accept this."
But...
- It's fine if you throw it out somewhere nearby.
It's pretty harsh to personally throw out something you made for someone.
"So, if Saeko-san could do it,"
I would be a little saved.

"According to the prop master, those two knives went missing on the last day of the shoot."
Ohh.
He's got the studio pulling drive-on logs from that day.
He's gonna send us over a copy so we can see if any of the names connect to one of the New York murders.

But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.

"Hey, let's see."
"Why are you like that, after one punch?"
After you beat me up last time...
I can't say I won...
I just got lucky when I went in with that punch.
"Anyway, since you gave up first, you have to do me a favor."
Think about it.
Why does my friend have to be accused of murder?
When the real murderer is out there.
Just tell me where his house is.
Please.
You said that you were hiding this secret for your friend's sake.
"You cover for your friend, and you fight really well..."
You're not doing anything bad.
This is for the good of your friend.
Come on.
Where is your friend's house?
Hello.
"Hello, there."
- Are you moving?
- What is this about?
We just got a call.
He said that he is the murder suspect for this case and that he will be coming to the police station at 5 p.m. to turn himself in.
But we got to talking.
"He said that he was persuaded by you, Representative."
By you.
"We wanted to have you there while he confessed, so we came here early."
Corbusier was mean.
"But Lou, now, there was a man."
"All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client... however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs."
"Every time I've tried to do art,"
I've ended up with a...
I've made much less.
"Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally."
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and...
and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
"He'd sit and work on art, see?"
And I always wished...
"I think he did too... wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better."
- Why?
"- Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words."
"It's animal attraction... his mind, really, because his person... to look at him wasn't much a pleasure."
- It wasn't?
- It couldn't be.
"See, he was so scarred."
"Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have."
- Who?
- Lou.
"He never came here, though."
- Didn't he ever come here?
- To the glass house?
"That's strange, 'cause I built it in '49."
Possible.
Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
- No.
- Why?
- Doc.
- Right.
But there's always a facilitator.
"I mean,Lex Luthor.Case in point."

But I found out they were just scared of me.
She didn't come out of that classroom for a whole week.
Can you tell me what's going on?
There's rumor about the fight.
"I had a fight with Caruso, the school bully."
"He beat me so bad,"
I had to take the Underground Railroad home.
Fight!
Fight!
But somehow that story turned into this story.
"Chris hit him in the jaw so hard, my tooth fell out."
"Chris knocked Caruso's eye out, put it back, and then knocked it out again."
Chris beat the snot out of him.
You can check his nose-- no snot!
"Chris chased him home, knocked out his family, then took their house."
"Now, when a rumor like this gets started, you never know where it's going to end up."
Are you sure about this?
"Yes, sir."
"After Chris kicked his teeth out, he said,"
"""And I better not see you trying to smile, cracker."""
Cracker...
"Yes, sir."

Bottom line:
Until you figure out who burned you... you're not going anywhere.
"- What do you think of these shoes, Michael?"
Fantastic!
I have just the right dress.
- Are they real?
"- Well, they look real."
Isn't that what counts?
"You're getting a fake identity, Michael.I can't get fake shoes?"
Place is up here somewhere.
"You know, you go ahead."
I'm gonna-
"Oh, that's pretty."
A fake identity is known in the spy trade as a false flag.
Used to be you could make your own documents with a printer and a laminator.
"These days, though, I.D.'s have magnetic strips,holograms and infrared watermarks."
- Hey.
- You need a pro.
-Yes.
What can I do for you?
-I lost my passport and driver's license.
"I heard, uh, I could get some new ones here."
All you gotta do is report 'em stolen.
They'll send you replacements.
Right.
But the thing is...
"I'm going on a trip soon, and I heard you could do it here more quickly... and more quietly."
That might be possible- for a fee.
A fee is not an issue.
Come on back.
"It's, like, Ludlow and Stanton."
I didn't realize that my ass was gonna be...
"- Ari, your ass."
- There it is.
It's so beautiful.
"- Goddamn you, Kat."
"- Does she say, ""My ass is in the air?"""
I remember you saying that.
"You really, really look like you..."
- Jesus.
"- You guys, I'm fine."
"That was like a big stunt, right?"
The timing of that was tough.
"With them pulling the door, and didn't it..."
It was tough and Ari ate that door a couple of times.
Yeah.
You're dedicated to your art.
Was that a take where she actually hit her head?
- I don't think so.
- Looks pretty convincing.
I think it's just the sound effect that makes it so powerful.
"- There they are, off into the night."
- I'm actually driving.
"- Yeah, and..."
- It died a bunch of times.
"Do you have any assemblies of those takes in the blooper reel at all, Pete?"
- Of Mike stalling the Yugo?
- Yeah.
"- No, I don't have them."
- The Yugo just slowing to a stop.
- No.
"- Are you doing, like, a blooper reel?"
Hello again.
"Hamit Milonkovic, you are charged with deprivation of his daughter."
Shit genuine.
Why are you locked?
Now you're crazy.
I have not seen Zana since she disappeared.
You said nothing about it to have arrived.
It was because he wanted her to die there?
That's why you cut the fire rope?
'You had the courage to blow up the bomb?
-No Hear what I said?
Shit genuine !
-You Have evidence for this?
"Zana has been there many times, willingly, but for a long time."
The girl's apartment was treated for minor cuts before disappearing.
The blood test confirms that it is Zana.
Do not answer.
I want to talk to my client.
Okay.
She arrived a few days ago.
Something happened to her.
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
"I would give a time to talk again, but failed."
Zana disappeared and I snapped.
Then you cut the fire rope to protect her?
Do you understand me?
I was afraid that she would get hurt.
She was not afraid of anything.
She could get hurt.
Where were you from 9 at 9:30 am when the bomb went off?
-With Him.
-Discutíamos The visitation agreement.
"Yes, I did say it."
And what will you do if I stop protecting you?
"You won't go to the refugee aid, and quite rightly so.."
In the camp they're very selective... they only let the politically persecuted through.
"Maybe you are a political, Pauline?"
"Could you give me some money, if I leave my child with you?"
What?
Then I could go to the West...
"You see, Pauline, you really are reasonable!"
Pay attention..
"I've saved up some money, a couple of hundred Mark... for the birth..."
I'll give it to you.
"Well, and you'll also need identification papers."
I'll get them for you!
"As for an ID card and such, Bruno will take care of it."
Then you can go to your fiancée in the West.
"Well, what is it, Pauline?"
Haven't I offered you enough?
500 Mark!
"I'd like to think it over, Mrs John."
"Well, yes..."
I only meant it well..
Just wanted to help you.
You sleep on it...
"That's all of it, Mr Hassenreuter!"
"Yes, my child."
That's all I have left after 20 years of cultural work.
"""The rest is silence..."""
Hamlet!
"Yes, my child, you should have seen me as Hamlet... people still talk about it."
"I'd have loved to, Mr Hassenreuter."
"Hamlet, Prince of Denmark."
- Do they make pink slate?
- That's enough.
"If it doesn't match your pants, I don't want it."
Slate is a word that falls apart if you say it more than three times.
"So 21 ,000 tons of slate by June."
"- Slate, slate, slate."
- Slate is a stone around my neck.
- Because you took it for granite.
- Right.
Cut it out.
We're slated to install these interiors... I'm going to do the rest of this job by myself.
- Yeah?
Rick.
- Huh?
It's for you.
Yeah.
Uh...
Now?
Okay.
Miles is here.
- l thought I smelled sulfur.
- You... shut up.
"Sammler and associates, I greet you."
"Sorry for the intrusion, but I needed a word with you, Rick, sooner rather than later."
"Well, sure, Miles."
"How was your vacation, by the way?"
Vacations can only be judged by the degree of discomfiture upon one's return.
"In this case, the vacation was a grand success."
"Do you believe in portents, Rick?"
What do you mean?
- How's your filing system here?
- Excuse me?
"[Taterbug] No, he don't, and you nor nobody else will put that kid in an orphan""s home."
What do you think of that?
"[Jim] Well, what are you going to do with him then?"
"[Taterbug] Well, I would-- well, doggone."
Quit this pen-pushing job and get back to work with self-respecting range-bred fellas ought to be doing.
"[Jim] What've you been up to, Taterbug?"
[Taterbug] Seen in the Abilene Cattleman's Journal calling for cow hands over in the Dusty Bend country.
And I answered it.
And there's a job waiting there for both of us.
"[Jim] But I'd rather be dumb than be an old, fussy fossil..."
You going to eat these chips?
No.
Okay if I...?
Sure.
Thanks.
[Jim] yes.
And you're dead set on the kid being educated?
"That Stoneset Trail Company is no place for a kid to get his schooling', is it?"
"Besides, I'm tickled to death right where I am."
"[Taterbug] Yes, you are."
"Say, old time, will you watch the office for a little while?"
I want to run out and throw him a little hay at darts.
"[Taterbug] Well, at least he's got horse sense."
That's more than you've got.
"[Jim] All right, crab."

I was one empanada away from a heart attack.
But then this...
"gorgeous godsend made me the lean, mean, fighting machine I am today."
[ Chuckles ] Hm.
[ Breathing rapidly ] Ho!
Oh.
[ Laughter ]
But I digress.
"Now, the good news is, we are hiring."
"The bad news is, there's only one trainer position available."
How do you feel about working in another department?
Huh?
Nice shorts.
Nice hairnet.
"Yeah, why do I got to be the lunch lady?"
Since when have you ever complained about being around food?
"Okay, this is not food."
"[ Peruvian accent ] Hey, new guy."
"Quit flirting' with the trainer and keep scooping', huh?"
It's all right.
"My, uh..."

How the hell do you know anything about yoga?
You're not the only one who's ever dated someone bendy.
"Hey, you have any oatmeal?"
"[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I wish."
"No, but we have, uh, something that's tofu over there."
I -- what is that?
It's a pancake.
It's tofu.
"I feel like a baby asking this, but..."
Will the treatment hurt?
Idiot!
"Hey Halwa, what are you still doing here?"
You are no ordinary man.
You made that lunatic a doctor.
How long is your game?
I can't with stand it.
This is nothing.
This is just an interval.
Climax is still pending.
Shall I tell you something shocking?
What?
I'm the thief whom your brother-in-law is looking for.
Why did he come to Malaysia?
He used to rob regularly in India.
Why is he quiet now?
Has he quit robbing?
What does December 16 mean?
There is lot of time left for that day.
"If he had quit robbing, why would he fix the target?"
Why is he robbing?
Who will he rob in Malaysia?
He must either rob the nrls.
Or rob those who have link with India.
Where could he be?
"If he had called from this phone booth, he must be living in these surroundings."
But where?
What do you think of yourself?
Is duty everything for you?
"Even after coming to Malaysia, you are still thinking about that thief."
Why did we come here?
For your engagement or to catch that thief?
What if something happens to you?
Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
Where's the nurse who did nights?
Matilde?
"She called, she can't come in today."
Didn't she notice anything odd?
Matilds having family problems.
Many nights she can't come in.
And who stands in for her?
Benigno.
Am Ito tell her father his daughter is in this retard's hands day and night?
Please!
Let's calm down here.
I don't know if you realize you are the main suspect.
Why did you hide her first missed period?
I'm sure you've got an explanation.
You're incapable of harming Alicia.
You can be sure of that.
Then...
"Last night, I was in the parking lot and heard a conversation between Benigno and Marco."
Benigno said he wanted to marry Alicia.
"- Come on, man!"
Let's go!
"Jack.Jack. Okay, the night porter didn't clean the grill, the big blender's broken... and someone crammed my locker full of Spanish pornography again."
- I'll look into it.
- Thank you.
"-Jack,Jack,Jack!"
- Yeah.
"Jack, three waiters called in sick."
Some kind of explosive intestinal-
They think I don't know Shakira's in town?

"""Bourdain Snubs Stunning Starlet."" Translate that for me."
The fabulous Lindsay Lohan was here last night... and you refused to leave the kitchen to say hello.
"Or so says the Post, which I trust implicitly."
I can't be everywhere at once.
I didn't even know she was here last night.
- Lindsay Lohan wants to say-
"- If it's not about the food, get out!"
- [ Screams ]
- I was cooking for 1 80 people.
I can't be everywhere at once.
"I'm not the master of time, space and dimension."
"If I may, your fans are your power base."
- You have to stroke your base.
- I'm not gonna embrace that metaphor.
You will get a second chance to kiss Miss Lohan's ass... when she returns...
for her dog.
- [ Barking ]
"- I'm here to cook, not kiss ass."
"Jack, Pino's on line one."
I shall dispose of you myself !
"You like scaring people, pal ?"
Why don't you let me show you how it feels ?
- It's Storm !
The rings !
"If she damages them further, she'll undo all she healed !"
Polemachus will be devastated !
"Storm, stop !"
Please !
"Storm, listen to me !"
What you're doing is wrong !
"If you want this dirt pile to still be here in the morning, friend,"
I'd get us some of those glowing golf balls right now !
You'll hurt innocent people !
Arkon's making you act against everything you believe in !
"Please, Storm, he's not worth it !"
You are right.
Forgive me.
"Come on, let's get out of here."
Storm !
Please !
"Storm, I can get anything, riches beyond your imagining, our world will worship you !"
We are going home.
"You will be nothing on Earth, cast out and despised, feared and reviled for your gifts !"
"What of the slaves, Arkon ?"
The slaves ?
What are they to our happiness ?
"Everything, Arkon."
I am offering you a world !
Don't be a fool !
The slaves are nothing.
No living being has the right to enslave another.
No!
- I Arthur?
"- Evil Clone, we do not touch the ""Don't"" button."
That would send Uncle Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
And let me say that hike back is no picnic.
I'd rather be strained through a chain-link fence.
[Shudders]
"Clone, go next door and fetch me a tissue sample from the Tick."
Got it?
A tissue sample.
I Arthur.
"You'll never get away with this, you over-confident blob."
The Tick will be on to that flimsy fabrication in a second.
He hasn't got a chance against the always-wary eye of the ever-alert Tick.

"[Tick mutters] Oh, hello..."
"[Tick] Oh, no..."
[Tick jabbers]
"Arthur, I just had the strangest dream."
"I was taking some math test I hadn't studied for, and then you tried to saw off my head."
"Weird, huh?"
I Arthur.
[Chuckles] Of course you are.
And I Tick.
[Chuckles]
"Whoa, oh... [crashing]"
"Oh, sorry, Arthur."
"Blast this uncommon cold, anyway."
"Well, only one thing to do now."
Wear this supercold down with many hours of daytime television.
"- Cool, thanks."
"- Uh, why does he get tickets?"
- Because he works here.
"- Well, if I work here, could I get tickets?"
- You don't work here.
- What's that right there?
"- Oh, you... you wouldn't want that job."
"- No, sure I would."
Sign me up.
- Seth...
"- You don't want to know the pay, the hours, job description?"
"- No, I'm good."
"- Minimum wage, long, uh, taking tickets, cleaning toilets, and the light preparation of fried foods."
- I'll be sure and wash my hands between the last two.
"I have to ask Nat, the owner."
"But he's never here, so..."
- Perfect.
"- Okay, I'm Alex."
You can start right now.
"If I don't fire you by the end of tonight, then come back tomorrow."
"- I have a mop, Ryan."
"- You've got a mop, bro."
"- So, you're doing all this for Summer?"
"- Yeah, for her friendship."
"- Wow, you really are changing."
"- Yeah, I am."
"Changing urinal cakes, that's how committed Seth Cohen is, to the new Seth Cohen."
"Okay, now you're talking about yourself in, like, the fourth person."
"Well, it's a whole new dimension of selflessness, Ryan."
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to the urinals."
I don't know where they are.
"Check out the new Ryan Atwood, studying at the breakfast table."
So where's Chris?
Good question.
"Hey, Christopher."
So you just send me a text and then leave?
I don't want to bother you any more than I already have.
Bother me?
(chuckles)
Is that what you call what you did?
"Oh, Chris, I'm so sorry."
I-I shouldn't have done it.
"Look, I don't understand."
"I took you in,"
"I tried to do the right thing, believed Tucker was mine."
Why did you lie about it?
I guess I was just desperate.
"You know, to get away from Darrell, to try and find a good daddy for Tucker, I..."
Get away from Darrell?
"What, did... did he try to hurt you or something?"
(sighs) Let's just... no.
"Melody, you gotta talk to me."
What's going on?
"Darrell has a temper, and I was afraid."
Not just... not just for me but for Tucker.
"I tried to get a restraining order against him, but they said I had to wait until something bad happened."
"And I was afraid, and I just-- I didn't know what to do."
I never meant to hurt you.
Okay.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Don't worry about Darrell.
He's not gonna hurt either one of you.
First his accountant said that he was laundering drug money through high-cash businesses.
Everyone let's line up
So we can make our way down please.
Girls on on side boys on the other
Girls on on side boys on the other
Right.
Well good luck up there.
How could I have forgotten?
We reserved our seats together.
Oh Lily and Rufus!
Oh We haven't seen you
- Since we broke matzo together.
- Hi.
- You look wonderful.
-Thank you.
Love--It's put color in all of our cheeks.
We were talking on the way over here
About what a wonderful couple you two make.
So we decided you should take the plunge like us.
Dating at our age is not enough.
Marry before it's too late.
Well It's not exactly
Uh We're just enjoying the journey.
Well Apparently at one point
We had a destination
But that no longer seems to be the case.
Subtle.
Mm I was going for honest.
Dear friends colleagues
As we stand here today
We bear witness to a bright new beginning.

I-I couldn't do it.
What a lovely name.

"(PLAYS ""FANTASIE-IMPROMPTU IN C MINOR"")"
(SIGHS)
- I'm not happy with it.
- Why?
Because a perfect impromptu should seem spontaneous and free.
No-one should be able to guess at the desperate calculation behind it.
I've been struggling with this for so long.
It's like being tangled in a net.
I feel...
I have terrible dreams at night.
"I think if I ever finish it, then it will have finished me."
You must suffer tortures to find the perfect word that will make it all seem effortless.
Me?
Suffer for art?
You must be joking.
I suffer quite enough for life.
I have no hope to be perfect.
I simply pump out pages for money.
"No, your books are admirable."
I've been reading them.
Have you?
GEORGE:
Ah.
Is this your family?
"No, that's my fiancee."
"Well, we are no longer engaged."
Her family didn't feel that I was a very good risk for a husband.
No-one expects me to live very long.
- Balls!
- I beg your pardon?
Fifty percent wool.
They also smell of mothballs.
When were they issued?
This morning?
What do you do for heat in this barrack?
No stove.
"The men here used it as a trap door, so we had to remove it temporarily."
How long is temporarily?
I trust not until July.
Here you see a meal the prisoners are getting.
"Schulz, what are we having today?"
Bean soup mit ham hocks.
Would you like to taste it?
"- Thank you, no."
-Where's the ham hock?
There should be a ham hock!
"When you find it, we'll send it to Geneva."
Are there any complaints?
Please speak up.
Don't be afraid to talk.
"That's what the Geneva convention is for to protect the rights of prisoners of war, whether they are Americans or Germans."
- What have you got to say?
-I like it here.
What about you?
"It's all right, considering."
What happened to you?
Were you beaten?
Why don't you answer?
- What did you do to this man?
-They didn't do nothing.
- Who beat you?
- Nobody beat me.

It's an old prison trick for dyeing hair.
Seriously?
Looks like our man's a blonde now.
Purchases were made at an ABC Store just up the street.
15 minutes ago.
"Factor in the time for a dye job, he couldn't have made it very far."
He could still be around here.
You see that?
"Excuse me, sir."
Every time I come across...
He wouldn't be there if it weren't for me.

"Yes, she did."

Now we can give Roland's mother a proper burial.
"Thank you, gentlemen."
So what did you glean?
Surely there was something.
"There was indeed, Dr. Ogden."
Mrs. Braxton was not a full woman.
Meaning?
She had no ovaries.
She was born without a complete reproductive system.
She couldn't bear children?
"Whoever she is, she isn't your baby's mother."
Who is this girl that you keep locked up?
And don't give me that story about Borneo.
I... came across her in the Appalachian Mountains some ten years ago.
"Well, she came across me, more like."
How so?
I was asleep in the caravan when I heard something rummaging around my campfire.
"In the darkness, I thought it was a bear"
- and almost shot it.
- Where did she come from?
No idea.
"You ask me, she was raised by wolves."
Highly unlikely.
"Sir, she's as wild as the day is long, mister."
"So, you keep her caged like a beast."
"Look, she's clothed and fed and in a better state than when I found her."
"And before you start, she's legally mine."
I have the paper to prove it.
There you go.
I would do it until a morning the with pleasure.
Tell dear Tót.
Where is he?
Excuse me.
It fell down.
Is there a some kind of paint in the house?
- Paint?
- Yes.
This environment is monotone.
Do you not see it?
This grew tired.
You know what I had it made with the sentry boxes in the barracks?
"With a red, yellow, blue paint painted they."
Into the boards I had angles beaten in order for it not to be possible to lean against him.
What is your opinion?
Interesting.
Should we paint the walls?
Everything.
Oh it doesn't matter.
Let us continue.
Let the hand move.
He was cut it off his new sock.
He was crying very much.
"How I remembered him, that strike one 8 monthly children."
"I don't know, I already said that Gyula followed away when I took the road from the front line to the station?"
- Really?
- That's right.
I took a liking to that child very much.
"We took a bath, we were drinking beer next in the canteen."
Oh my sweet god.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
I hear.
"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"So we throw some in a college fund, but the rest is fair game, right?"
"After taxes, after we pay Doug and after my management fee."
"Okay, fine, manager."
- Can you loan me a few grand?
- What for?
Clothes.
I had my cancer purge.
"But now I am in the public eye, and I have nothing to wear."
You want to take Isabelle's hard-earned dollars and blow them on glad rags for your star turn on Agrestic Access TV?
You bought a motorcycle and a ridiculous leather jacket.
All right.
Let me think about it.
No.
- Are you okay?
You look a little frazzled.
- I'm fine.
- Who kicks ass?
- I'm guessing you.
I totally kick ass!
"- What does ""kicking ass"" entail?"
"- A girlfriend, but that's not all."
Did a free cheese grater come with the girlfriend?
"Oh, stop it."
I'm gonna be the class speaker for graduation.
"- Sweetie, that's fantastic."
"- Way to go, little man!"
The whole lower school voted.
I'm gonna go start working on my speech.
"- Congratulations, honey."
- Thanks.
"- Oh, are we worried?"
What's the problem?
- It's your sister.
- I just got off the phone with her.
Not Kitty.
- What do you mean you knew?
- I ran into her at Holly's house.
You didn't think it was worth mentioning?
- I didn't think you wanted to hear it.
- You were right.
"- Well, what was she like?"
- I don't know.
She...
She seemed fine.
How long is she staying?
"If this is just a visit, drop it."
It's not just a visit.
She dropped out of college and was living with a friend.
"When that didn't work out, she moved back home."
Indefinitely.
Sounds like Holly raised a real winner.
"Despite your opinion of Holly or Rebecca, the question remains, what are we going to do?"
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
Not with everything that's been going on here.
- What's that supposed to mean?
"- What I mean, Tommy, is do you think this business with Holly can go on if Mom finds out about Rebecca?"
This is exactly why I didn't want to say anything.
Holly is working here.
What if Nora runs into Rebecca?
What if your mother asks questions?
I say we tell her.
"I can't believe I'm hearing this from you, Saul."
I am...
"I am a crystal clear well, please dri..."
I am a crystal clear well...
"-That's beauty, isn't it?"
"-Yes, but we would..."
Mother Nature will outlive us all.
-It's beautiful.
-But we are looking for...
"Yes, yes, a rest."
We have wonderful things here.
"Yes, but we are looking for..."
"It's something, isn't it?"
"Wow, it's like at our home."
"According to the dynamic plan of the landscape development, there should be a hundred years of untouched nature here later."
-Let's continue.
"-Yes, but..."
-Who are you actually looking for?
-A colleague.
"He got lost, We're worried about him."
In our forest nobody can get lost.
"Oh, yeah, in the past horrible things happened here."
"Rabbits ate grass, foxes ate rabbits and bears ate whatever crossed their mind."
But now thank God there is order here.
Look.
"I know a crystal clear well, where the forest is the deepest."
"Dark bracken grows there and in the surroundings, red heather."
"Thank you for your visit, sirs."
We are closing.
"Please, wait."
We've lost our friend here.
"But no one can get lost here, sirs."
-It belongs to the ministry of culture.
- You've always despised the Wu-tang.
And you're afraid that someday we'll overtake you.
You...
So you used your medicine to poison my master.
Nonsense!
You're scared that our power will surpass yours.
"Nonsense, don't flatter yourself."
Our Wu-tang...
Someone is trying to pin the blame on us.
Then where did His Highness get your medicine?
Where is your proof that the medicine is ours?
His Highness said so.
His Highness?
Then why did he lock you up with the crazy women?
Because I'm guilty of killing my master.
Your master threw himself onto your sword.
And now His Highness wants to learn your secrets.
I won't tell him!
Master told me before he died not to let the Tartars have the secrets of Wu-tang.
The Shaolin would never reveal our secrets either.
"You want to see the Wu-tang destroyed, hence your trickery."
Brother!
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Mr. Chao!
Mr. Hong!
"Fung-wu, even if we were to learn your 8-divine sword, she already knows Chin Kang Fist."
Chin Kang Fist?
"Jun-kit, you taught her the Chin Kang Fist to help me, but you still haven't taught me."
You haven't learned it?
Did you teach him?
- I!
A man with your talents...
"My talent is gambling, Pop."
"Hoofing is all right, but there's no future in it."
I want to spread out.
"I think I'm going to miss you, Lucky."
"I know I'm going to miss you, Pop."
"Is he staying with us, Pop?"
"No, he's made up his mind to get married."
How do you like that?
Letting his marriage interfere with our career?
We shouldn't have played his hometown.
It was a bad move.
Bad for us and bad for him.
Local boy makes bad.
"- Father, has he come yet?"
"- No, and it's all very much as I expected."
"Hi, fellows."
- How do I look?
"- Marvelous, colossal, splendid."
Wait a minute.
You're not going like that.
Of course.
"Big church wedding, girl's family very social... whole town there."
"I guess it doesn't really matter, just a hick town."
What doesn't matter?
- Last year's trousers.
- Last year's trousers?
No cuffs.
- No cuffs?
- No cuffs.
Whoever heard of cuffs on these?
Are you serious?
How's your gin?
- How was he?
He has a quality that can only be described as... chrome.
- And?
- He seems to wanna help me.
How can he help you?
He didn't say.
He's got great stories.
I'd love to hang out with him again.
Do we have plans?
- Do we have plans when?
- Whenever.
"Yes, Philip, I'd say sometime in the indeterminate future, we may have plans."
Good shoot today?
Can you just leave me alone?
I have to do this.
You're fucking with other people's money here.
"Money, money, money."
What about my integrity?
"You know, I can think of a few other important writers who also took a firm no-press position."
I just wanna know that you've thought it through thoroughly.
I haven't.
"It's a very impulsive decision, and I'm very pleased with myself for that."
"Philip, this is Josh Fawn."
"Josh, this is Philip, who's being a baby and an asshole."
Ciao.
"Yes, we've met before."
We've done some panels together.
Er...
I remember one of them.
"Phil, Josh is going on a promotional tour for his new book."
That's what responsible authors do.
"Mrs. Quick, no!"
"Mrs. Quick, we've got to get you out of here."
"Now don't get too upset, okay?"
There's got to be a simple explanation.
"It's a bee sting, isn't it?"
Okay.
"I thought I heard buzzing earlier, but I attributed it to my tinnitus."
P.A. ANNOUNCER:
"The next dance is for our King and Queen nominees, and then it's time for everyone to vote."
"Mrs. Quick, don't panic, okay?"
We're going to rush you to the hospital.
The doctors are going to take care of you.
Everything will be fine.
I just need one minute.
Got him.
I knew he couldn't resist that thumbnail- sized Toblerone.
Thank goodness.
Zap him back so we can go home.
Right.
But first a little good-natured torture.
Hilda.
Where am I?
Um... we found you wandering out in the street.
I-I think you may have hit your head.
Do you feel all right?
Do you perhaps feel like you now understand what it's like to be the little guy in constant fear of unfeeling giants?
No.
I feel strong.
"In fact,"
I feel like I could withstand a nuclear holocaust.
I suppose this means you're going to go ahead and build your Everything Emporium now.
What?
What?
Oh!
it's to remind you of who you are.
I love it.
I am gonna put it up on my wall at brown
As soon as I get back from europe. oh!
Come with me.
I chased a guy for years who wasn't that into me
And going to a glorified state school.
My mother married an entertainment lawyer.
so I need to just stop moving
And contemplate the failure of my life.
Well When you're ready to start moving again
- You know I'll be here.
- Yes of course I do.
Humphrey Where's your mind?
I know it sounds crazy
But I actually-
- I kind of miss high school.
I miss blair waldorf and her daily ego demolitions
Nelly Yuki stealing my lunch
Even Chuck Bass who would get so close to talk.
Wow. you miss Chuck Bass.
Well not as much as you probably miss Chuck Bass.
But yeah I uh I think it's safe to say
That the nostalgia's officially begun.
Apparently the upper east side feels the same way about you.
What's up Dan Vanessa?
Shouldn't you be getting the deputy mayorher coffee or something?
Well I think she'd rather I gave her something else.
- Yeah she made a pass at me. - god. is she hot?
Actually yeah she is.
- Me!
Oh.
"Okay, I'm heading out there."
"If you need anything, if there's a crisis, if you have a question-"
"Jack, you're 1 1 feet away."
Don't worry.
I can handle these animals.
- That's what she thinks.
- I heard that!
[ Laughing ] Girl is like a flipping bat.
"- Now go be pretty, okay?"
- Okay.
"Go, go."
"We're fine, really."
[ Sighs ] Waste of time.
Let's get this over with quickly.
- Where do I start?
"- Actually, table eight just sent compliments to the chef."
- [ No Audible Dialogue ]
- Gotta do what I gotta do.
Everyone enjoying themselves tonight?
[Jack Narrating ] Every chef will tell you that he feels out of place... ifhe's not sweating over a hot stove.
But the truth is you can get used to the sweet life out front pretty damn quickly.
I just always had this real need to please people with food.
"I just think it's, like, uh, a gift that I have, as God made me."
"Hey, uh, if your father calls... tell him that I'm working the floor like he asked, okay?"
"-Yeah, you're really taking one for the team."
"-Actually, I'm shooting for two."
I'm just kidding.
I'm kidding.
"No, I'm not."
This table needs a complimentary everything.
I'm well--known round here for it.
I'm famous in the chest.
"Don't half turn the chicks on, right?"
The only snag is if the waistband on your jeans is too tight.
That's what jeans are all about.
"If your jeans aren't tight enough, you might as well be dead, right?"
Can you repeat all that?
I couldn't hear you for the sounds.
"I was just saying, like, you know, I dig all your gear."
-
- You got any blancmange?
-
"- Yeah, I got two of their LPs."
Life's full of excitement when you're engaged!
Where are you going with that?
"The magnificent metal digit is going on the pavement, p--pointing at the shop."
It's the opening salvo in me new advertising c--campaign.
"You spare no expense, do you?"
It's your old ice cream sign!
That's just for openers.
The hard sell comes later.
-
- It's all peeling and rusty.
-
"- Oh, yes."
How is your mother this morning?
-
- She's wandering.
-
"- Oh, is she?"
Perhaps we can get her to wander off completely!
-
And how was your breakfast this morning?
It went really well.
I can tell that's 100% not true.
"Okay, are you two, like, legit fighting?"
"No, it's fine."
It's just...
"Audrey has some unflattering opinions about my dad, that's all."
"No, they're memories, not opinions."
"And, sometimes, maybe people are going through big things that have absolutely nothing to do with you, Emma."
Big shocker!
"At the most, it's identity theft."
"And, even then, what's the real harm?"
"I'm sorry, Mag."
I-I didn't mean to sound dismissive.
It's just... you've seen the reports of all the hijinks since your unfortunate run-in with Ms. Shaw.
That's a pretty damning understatement.
"- Look, we all grew up here."
- And you left.
You both left.
My family left because of that whole Brandon James mess.
"Miguel, with our particular history,"
I think you should investigate.
(SIGHS)
You know what?
You're right.
Just to be safe.
I know a guy in the bureau back in Phoenix.
He can try to trace the activity.
Take a while.
"But, for now, do not tell Emma."
Okay?
We don't need the whole student body talking.
Okay.
"Oh, Dad's here."
I gotta go.
"I love you, Mommy."
[Karen] I love you too.
- Hey.
- You set to go?
Mm-hmm.
Let's go.
"You can call the Romans a lot of things, but stupid isn't one of them."
"Okay, well, not really stupid, but, all right, they built roads, and they had a million armies, but all they did was enslave and conquer people."
- What about their system of law?
"- Oh, great."
"They introduced law to barbarians, but how did the barbarians feel about that?"
"All their art was copied from the Greeks, all their philosophies were stolen from the Greeks."
The gods were stolen from the Greeks.
They just gave them different names.
Think of one thing that they did that was original.
They didn't even invent Christianity.
"If I was a Roman, I would be so ashamed of myself, I couldn't show my face in the Coliseum."
[Lily] Pasta's ready!
"Eli, you have to save me from Dad!"
I'll set the table.
Don't worry.
"Thank you, Jessie."
"We're gonna get through this, whatever happens."
"Rick, whatever happens."
Did she actually cook for us?
That's pretty cool.
- [knock on door] - l got it.
Cook County Sheriff's Department.
We have a warrant to search.
Here you have.
It is it to me before.
How I have left?
I do not understand how you can lower like this.
"Ten, for fortify."
Is it possible to be known who is that girl by whom arms as much trouble?
"Good morning, Mr. Santarelli."
You are friends of him?
"No, we are of the S.L.R. Service Cleaning New born."
"Yes, those that leave bad we threw, them."
What has happen to him?
Notices some sharp pain?
Where?
Here?
In the kidneys?
Where it is?
I pillaged it.
The temperature is normal.
What feels?
"Go, Go."
"Well, Doctor, we go away."
"Yes, we have an appointment in tanatorio."
One has gone to him?
"It was not a real pain, it is an emotional reaction."
It seemed to him that he was bad and he began to complain.
But now it is under my cares.
"A series of analysis will be necessary, so that it is better so that it is better to drain the intestine completely, we are going to begin by a medicinal injection."
-It does damage to me.
-Shut up.
Lady?
there is something for me?
Delay mail?
"Very clever, very careful, and then...a bomb hit the building where he was working and everyone was killed."
We thought...
But he wasn't dead.
He was buried in the rubble under a stairwell.
"He survived, you see... for three days in the dark until they dug him out."
"And there was a girl in there, too."
But she was dead.
- They were trapped.
- For three days?
We sent him to a psychiatrist... because he was...different afterwards.
Still good at his job...
"almost too good, but different."
I often feared what might have happened down there.
"But the psychiatrist said he was fit to work and I needed him, so..."
Where is he now?
(Sighs)
There was a fire.
We found his body.
"His signet ring, his keys."
"No face, of course."
"I chose not to pursue it, not to question it."
I was almost relieved when I heard.
I'll let you have all the paperwork I've got on him.
"There's not much, I'm afraid."
There's been some sort of accident.
(Knock on door)
Hello.
Harry.
"The doctor's seen her, nothing's broken, but the bruising's pretty bad."
She can stay here for now.

But I think you know that deep down inside.
Mighty soldier!
Our mighty States will not tolerate defeat!
"To ensure that, there's something you must get."
"With that, you will have the body of steel."
You want me to get on?
I'll do it.
But...
I don't want you to go on anymore.
Look at the state it's in.
I'll go.
"For you, too."
How could that be?
They blocked us from using Bout Dimension...
So the protection device is still disengaged...
Burning...
NO!

Goddamn it!
You let Black Elk go out without orders?
"Over time, its body won't be able to bear the burden..."
Our mighty States will not tolerate defeat...
Right?
Ahhh...!
What...?
They're here.
"Multiple unidentified objects from outer space, are currently descending at a high speed!"
"They look exactly like the specter pattern, ""Exception."""
Is that related to that monster we fought in Narita?
Wh...
What the hell's going on?
"Hey, you guys aren't gonna fight in here, are you?"
And why not?
I pay half the rent.
We lose our cleaning deposit if any half gets messed up.
"Oh, the cleaning deposit."
What was I thinking?
"Of course, you're right."
- Now what?
- How about the roof?
"Good call, Arthur."
There's a place good always fights evil.
"Well, works for me."
"Frankly, that's why I was so glad to find this great apartment."
You'd be surprised how hard it is to get a place in the city.
"Never mind that most folks are hesitant to rent to a slime-based organism, much less one with intentions of taking over the world."
And human brains too!
Don't forget the brains!
"It is good, this roof."
I am pleased.
- [Squelching]
- Come on.
"Let's get this over with, nose jelly."
"Tick, wait."
"- Hey, no whispering."
"- Tick, keep them busy."
I think I know how to get Thrakkorzog back to his own dimension.
"When I give you the ""high"" sign, try to throw the Mucus Tick into Thrakkorzog."
"A ""high"" sign?"
Are you a great sidekick or what?
Let's get to it.
Break!
Coward.
It's been open to that same page for the last three days.
"Oh, that's the centre page."
It opens there naturally.
- How long for the pancakes?
- Just a few minutes.
Well I'll finish getting dressed.
Mother?
"Mother, I can't wear this coat."
"Yes, you're right, Samantha."
The colour isn't very becoming to you.
"Oh, that's perfect."
Mother.
"I know, I know."
"I don't understand, but I know."
"I will have a mink coat when Darrin can afford it, and not before."
"Well, by the time Darwin can afford a mink, mink will be extinct."
"Now, be honest with yourself, Samantha."
Wouldn't you adore to have that coat?
Well...
Wear it in good health.
Mother.
You take back this coat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
"It's crazy, but I've been looking at that picture of that mink coat for so long, I could've sworn you were just wearing one."
Darrin would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
"I don't know, honey."
L...
I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
I've been doing pretty much the same job for the last three years and what have I accomplished?
"Sweetheart, I think you accomplished a great deal."
Like what?
- Yes.
- I am Tonjura.
I am pleased to meet you.
-It's an honor to meet you.
- We would like to extend our deepest regret.
We cannot help you in this matter.
We are not a violent species.
And not equipped for war.
"I'm sorry, Robert."
- The Arktorians have always been here.
"Silently monitoring human progress, along with several other races."
But now they're all returning home.
-You mean evacuating?
So now we really are alone.
-Yes.
Thousands of years of accumulated human data ends here.
- You could have gone back with them.
Why didn't you?
Or at least given them the Purian.
- They've fulfilled their duties to the council.
This is not one of them.
"And as I stated before, I'm not leaving."
-Is this John?
John Walker?
"- Yes, yes, this is John Walker."
- It's Denise from the motel.
You told me to call if anyone came inquiring.
"Well, there are government agents inside this room as we speak."
"Well, you didn't tell them anything, did you?"
- No.
I didn't.
But these guys have real badges.
The guy was an industry legend.
Oh.
Wow!
You are so going to hit that.
"No, I just think we're going to be great together on the air."
And on the sofa and on the bed and on the coffee table.
"All right, all right."
I'm gonna go up on the roof and stand there by myself for five minutes.
Have fun.
And that's exactly what she did.
She just stood there.
"All right, kids, I'm gonna level with you."
That's not what she did.
Here's what she did.
"All right, all right."
I'm going to go have a cigarette.
BOTH:
What?
!
NARRATOR:
"I promised her I'd never tell you this, but once upon a time, your Aunt Robin did enjoy the occasional cigarette, and occasionally that occasional cigarette... was more than just occasional."
I just left something like this in my apartment.
"Robin, come on, take it to the roof."
We said no smoking in the apartment after you torched the throw rug doing push-ups.
"All right, all right, all right."
Geez.
"Yeah, Robin, I mean, God, not only is that a filthy habit, but also, can I bum one?"
Sure.
What?

"- Dan, what is that projection?"
"- Thank you, Greg."
"CNN is prepared to make the following projection that Virginia, with its 13 electoral votes, is a win for President Meyer."
This election is a tie.
We did it!
We have one more hurdle to overcome.
And we shall overcome.
One more river to cross.
One more mountain to climb.
But I have been to the mountaintop.
Thank you.
- I don't know what to do.
- We don't do anything.
- You do what you have to do.
"- Yeah, I'm getting drunk."
"Hey, Dan, when you get this, can you put in a good word for me with Greg?"
I think that I need to keep my TV work going.
"Okay, you're gonna win."
"And if you don't, I'll kill myself."
"Kent, what happens next?"
You've got to know.
"No, I'm afraid not."
"Some of these House races,"
- they're still too close to call.
- What does that mean?
"Well, presently, we cannot predict the result of the vote in Congress on January 20."
- We're in a kind of purgatory.
- Welcome to my world.
- Can you stop thinking about yourself for one second?
- Honestly.
"No, because I'm going to prison."
Have I mentioned that?
- No!
You will be playing right into her hand.
I'm a good person!
You knew what you were getting into when you married me.
"Okay, but no crawling up her butt."
"No, like, ""Oh, we're just so happy you're here!"""
- I don't sound like that.
"- Dad, did you say something?"
All right.
So.
How was your trip?
"Not easy, as you can imagine."
Anna-Kat and I saw a video of this guy going through security who was caught smuggling a monkey in his underpants.
"It was supposed to be sedated, but it was awake."
- And very angry.
- Mm.
"Well, uh, we're happy you're here."
I...
"Check on the, uh, Thanksgiving."
Just leave it.
"Grandma is known for pretending, so even though she looks hurt, remember the important thing is that she's not hurt."
So no one talk about the monkey bars on Grandma's head.
I love watching your mouth move.
Dude.
"Anna-Kat, you don't need to squeeze your stress ball."
Mom is fine.
We are like E.T. and Elliott.
Whatever happens to one happens to the other.
Oh!
You're like me.
So you get a weird feeling in your tummy whenever you see a mommy that's taller than a daddy.
Totally.
Come on.
- Get your hands off of me!
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!
I'm going.
I'm going.

Can't we just go home?
If I gotta drag you to the doctor at 8 in the morning...

I must look like an idiot.
Wish I could tell you different.
You're the reason we went to the eye doctor in the first place.
"You said, ""Throw me a piece of toast. """
I threw you a piece of toast.
"Two cups of regular coffee, please."
-My treat.
"-Oh, that makes up for everything."
"Pigeons can feed out of my eye socket, but I get a free cup of coffee."
Just the coffee.
Keep the change.
I'm gonna need your help until I get this patch off.
I am absolutely there for you.

There am preparation to you meatballs to have dinner.
Meatballs.
"Thanks, mother."
Thanks.
I will be on time.
You have heard?
My dear mother is preparation meatballs for me to have at dinner.
I also will do them to you when we are married.
It will not be necessary.
She will do.
What?
I have not said it to you?
We wanted give a surprise
She will come to live with us.
It does not seem to you a good idea?
Clearly.
But?
you know?
"I thought that once married, we would be both single."
"Laura, here no."
You already know gossip that she is the doorman.
"We go, hide."
"-Either they come, or they come."
"she will not bother to you minimumly, on the contrary, it will help you, in house does everything."
She is insurmountable.
"Ah, yes?"
What time is it?
Four and the average one.
You want that it takes to house or to the consultation?
"But, how?"
"I have postponed all the visits, we did not have that to happen together afternoon?"
"Yes, I believe it is customary."
I suppose we go on the deck and into the matter comfortably.
I'll get my wrap.

But it's not here now.
"I'm gonna stick my neck out, Kojak."

(LAUGHING) Wow!
How could you?
"Ted, I challenged myself to get laid wearing overalls."
"And if you stand in my way, then you're letting Barney win."
And you don't want that.
That smug son of a bitch will never let us hear the end of it.
"Oh, thank God."
Maggie...
Where do you think you're going?
- To tell that girl I love her.
"- Get in line, bub."
Yeah.
"I'm going to have sex with her, then he's going to tell her he's in love with her, and then you can do whatever you want."
Do we agree on the order?
Mister!
-I probably would have.
-Yeah.
[Door beeps]
ARCHER:
Come in.
"-I didn't mean to wake you, sir."
"-It's all right, I was getting up anyway."
-How are you feeling?
-I've been better.
You sure you had that pistol set to stun?
Captain.
I hope you understand if there'd been any other way....
"You were protecting our mission, Trip."
I would have done the same thing.
"Still, I never thought I'd find myself pointing a weapon at you... no matter what the circumstances."
"Let's put this behind us, okay?"
"Yes, sir."
What's our status?
We just recovered the last of our antimatter reserves.
The hatchlings?
Phlox says there's 19 of them running around down there.
Chances are they'll survive until the next Xindi ship comes along.
It's time we got back on the road.
I want you at your post.
We're going to be pushing the engines pretty hard.
I'll be on the Bridge.
Aren't you supposed to get some rest?
ARCHER:
I've had plenty.
"I'm sorry, sir, but the Doctor was insistent."
Okay.
I guess I don't want another mutiny on my hands.
"The minute they walk out that door, they walk into a dog-eat-dog world."
"It's crawl in front of the big dogs if you want to eat, get a job."
I won't do it.
I won't do it!
"That's why I'm washing windows, scrubbing walls, emptying ashes."
I never had nothing I ever wanted.
Shakespeare did me no more good than Washington did crossing the Delaware.
You didn't help yourself.
"Elsie, I'd like to have you meet Mike Rossi."
Ms. Thornton.
"- Hello, Ms. Thornton."
- Mr. Rossi.
- Welcome to Peyton Place.
- Thank you.
"This is our utility man, Lucas Cross."
"- Hello, Lucas."
- My hand's too dirty.
I'll start on another room.
Does he always drink?
He's disappointed for me.
Loyalty is always more passionate than reason.
I guess that's why I came to see you first.
There was sentiment for making you principal.
"Please don't feel uncomfortable, Mr. Rossi."
My time came too late.
- I hope we can work together.
- Of course we can.
"I suppose you have a lot of new, progressive ideas."
"No, not really."
"I'm rather old-fashioned, as a matter of fact."
I have just two rules:
"First, I want this school to teach the truth as far as we know it."
No.
No.
So...
How you doing?
"Oh, you know, lousy."
"Montezuma's revenge, big time."
"I mean, everything's going through me like crap through a tinhorn."
Better not get too close.
"Well, I'll take my chances."
I guess you heard about what happened down in Juárez?
Terrible.
What do you expect?
Bunch of freaking animals.
It's like Apocalypse Now down there.
It's like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You know, you don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards you send him home."
You know?
"I was, you know..."
"""He's out getting an evidence bag and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture, you know."""
So are you home for good then?
"No, no."
It's...
Playing it by ear.
To be determined.
Think you might wanna talk it through with somebody?
"What, a shrink?"
"No, no, no."
Can't go down that road.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
"look down in pity--"""
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!
Shut up!
She'll never forgive you!
Shut up!
Why this girl?
It doesn't make sense.
Holy water!

Are you tired?
Let's rest before we start again.
-What's ridiculous about it?
"Come on, don't jerk me off."
This is me you're talking to.
"You've caused much suffering yourself, haven't you?"
My wife prays to God.
What kind of God does this shit?
How about Carmine Lupertazzi?
Christopher ever talk about a dinner with him and Tony last July?
"What's the matter, Adriana?"
You and Christopher arguing?
"It's a stressful time, right before a wedding."
A lot of guys get cold feet.
"He's fucking stoned on H all the time, Okay?"
"There, you happy?"
We put you guys on the mailing list for Hazelden.
That rehab shit?
That's where all the brochures are coming from?
From you?
"Convince him he needs help, that he should be in rehab."
"Look at you, with that little face."
"These flat screens, I'll tell you, no glare, high definition."
I was watching On the Waterfront down at Sears.
Karl Malden's nose hairs looked like fucking BX cables.
Voice mail again.
"Chrissy, we're down here waiting for the TVs."
Let me ask you something.
"The other day, T with that picture... he looked like he was going to cry."
Still no word from Ralph.
Where the fuck is this kid?
What you want around here?
-Can you do an eighth of scag?
-$500.
But thank you for the invitation all the same.
Ladies and Gentlemen.
"Henry and I would like to thank you all very much for coming, and Lady Felicia, of course, for all your kindness."
25 years sounds a lot.
"Some of you will know it's not been our easiest year but we've stuck though it, together, like we always have."
"And, well, I think that's the secret of a happy marriage, really."
"So thank you, and enjoy your evening."
What about Edie?
"Red Lion, anyone?"
"Ready to sweep all before you tomorrow, Mrs M?"
Tomorrow?
"Oh, you mean the flower show."
"That's just a bit of fun, isn't it?"
"Now, what can I do for you?"
About George...
You can save your breath.
You clearly put him up to that little stunt.
"Mrs M, you've got it all wrong."
He did come and see me but only because he was feeling nervous.
He'd wanted to ask you out for lunch for a very long time.
"He seems a jolly decent chap, and I think he really likes you."
Was there anything else?
No.
Only that Gerard's Brasserie is quite the place to be at the moment and the Dover sole is really rather good.
"Your Cosmos looks lovely, by the way."
Edie.
Tea's up!
George.
"Mrs McCarthy, good morning."
May I have a word?
"Yes, yes, of course."
Let me just...
We'll find her soon.
I've also looked for her.
"I thought she was in the gap, but she wasn't."
What gap?
The place she goes when she doesn't want to hear anymore.
- What doesn't Emilie want to hear?
- When you argue and stuff.
Let's go downstairs and get a cookie.
Come.
I've packed the basics for him.
We'll wait and see where he wants to sleep.
Any news?
Not yet.
Did Carl or Emilie ever mention a place they call the gap?
No.
Special Branch insist that their concern for the PM and the notebook meant nothing.
We need all the information.
They must have a copy of the numbers.
The head of Special Branch will come in the morning to explain.
- Did Burch say anything to you?
- No.
Any news on the perp?
We don't know how he got your number.
He returned to Zeeland as a stowaway on a train.
We fauna' blood matching his.
- Did no one see anything?
- No.
- But we have the lab results.
"- Hi, don't tum on the heating."
"The preliminary tests of the perp's DNA indicate with 99% certainty, that he's Louise Hjelby's biological father."
I've set things in motion.
"The father's unknown, so dig up more on the mother."
It's remarkable.
Tremendous.
"Look, at long last."
The Temple of Ages!
This statue's extraordinary.
I've never seen anything like it.
I don't think it's a statue.
You're right.
I believe we have discovered
Solon himself.
"He must have been caught in a volcanic eruption, and covered in hot ash."
Like the bodies at Pompeii.
He's hanging on to something here.
It's the platinum book.
"Yes, like the page we found inside the Ark."
"Yes, well I think I'd better hold onto that."
Might just help defray some of my traveling expenses.
Look!
The gods march in rank.
"The riddle says when the planets are aligned, we'll find the Treasure of Atlantis."
Where is it?
The red crystal.
The one in the observatory?
We forgot the second line of the riddle.
"""Hecate races in the heavens."""
The planets alone isn't enough to reveal the treasure.
It takes something more.
Hecate has to appear.
Who the devil's Hecate?
A demon of the night who rides a chariot of fire.
There she is.
A meteor shower.
"Hey, Janice."
-You and your boyfriend got me.
-l don't know what you mean.
"Well, I got a hot flash for you."
You don't got dick.
I'm gonna ace the drug test and take the results...
... andshovethemupyour  chicken-hearted boyfriend's ass.
What did Dee Dee's mother want?
"Look, let's talk in the interview room, all right?"
I hope you're not paying attention to what she says.
According to her...
... DeeDeestillhad her cherry.
A stone junkie.
She still thought her daughter ran around in a convent school uniform.
I wish you didn't leave messages at my house.
Connie's worried.
You were down to work.
We tried reaching you.
What are you gonna do?
"More ""rub Mike's nose in it""?"
"""How could Roberts mess up on procedure?"""
-Procedure?
-l got overinvolved with a snitch.
"It's not a hanging offense, is it, guys?"
"Hey, do I need a PBA rep or a lawyer?"
I thought seven years working together counted for something. lt doesn't.
"In her diary, you threaten her life."
"Said you'd kill her if she calls your wife, which we heard her threaten."
KELLY:
Tell us what happened between you two before she died.
What are you saying?
You think I killed her?
"I don't know, but maybe we should start running."
I always thought your idea of having a combat base was crazy.
"Vila, I won't run."
We have to find out what it is they're doing.
Why the old colonies are being conquered so easily.
Then perhaps we can do something about it.
The five of us?
"Oh, and Trooper Orac here."
We need to know how they are doing it.
"It's possible that the Federation have some new weapon, something we don't know about."
- All the more reason to start running now.
"- Oh, drop it, Vila."
Avon's right.
"If it is something new, how are we going to find out about it?"
There's only one way.
AVON:
We have to go to Helotrix.
(Rustling)
"Our duty target's nice and steady now, sir."
Hasn't moved for an hour.
Then presumably Igin's got back to base.
"All right, prepare for neutron strike."
"All launchers mobile, sir."
Ready launchers 3 and 17.
Fifty-metre bracket pattern.
"- 3 and 17 locked on, now."
- Primary relay open.
Safety lock clear.
Fire.
Countdown.
"Four, three, two."
They must have had some kind of marker on him.
"Oh, it's these jokes Ben Littmeyer gave me at lunch."
"Ben Littmeyer, from the sociology department?"
"Yes, oh he has the best sense of humour."
I finally convinced him to host the fundraiser.
"Well, why didn't you ask me to do it?"
I have a wonderful sense of humour.
"Nina, come in here."
"I have a wonderful sense of humour, don't I?"
Ohhh.
See?
- Oh!
"This is an important fundraiser for Pendleton, and Ben can get those fat cats to cough up some cash."
Well I can make a fat cat cough.
I can even make him vomit.
"Thanks Dick, but Ben already said yes."
You don't think I'm funny?
"Oh Dick, you're loving, and intelligent, and sexy.."
and funny?
- Oh!
I have a class!
I am funny!
I am funny!
I am!
What happened to your coat?
"I don't know what happened to it, so Mrs. Dubcek let me borrow this one."
Sweet woman.
So you lost your coat?
Oh tough break.
"I lost more than a coat, Tommy!"
"I lost a friend, a buddy, a companion, who kept me warm when it was cold and warmer when it was really sort of too hot to be wearing a coat."
"Tommy, look, you're the information officer."
What do you know about this thing they call a sense of humour?
I probably wasn't right for you.
Daring?
What are you talking about?
"If a guy showers you with eternal love, suddenly you're suffocating."
"If he doesn't, it's what you want, isn't it?"
"You're so scared of losing, you never invest yourself in anything."
"Well, except your damn work, of course."
I just wanted to...
"Anna, please."
"Just tell him what he means to you,   or you'll spend the rest of your life thinking love hurts."
- But... how do you know?
"- Good night, Anna."
And good luck.
What if Camilla and Johan had already planned their future?
What if she'd love to have babies and he said he'd never leave her?
In my flat!
Frank was right.
I had to conquer my fear of defeat.
I had to risk the pain.
I had to go back into that flat.
"(footsteps on stairs, heavy breathing from bedroom)"
Johan?
"- Johan, I have to talk to you."
- You see any fucking Johan in here?
Anna!
Christ!
What happened?
"Oh, my God, Anna... (air rock music)"
Had I just blown all chances of ever seeing him again?
"Apparently, Johan had left the flat to go to some boat."
Of course!
The boat!
Right.
"Well, now, the way I got it figured... the girl probably"
Feels a lot of unconscious hostility
Toward that brother of hers.
"I mean, after all, he's the one having a good time."
And she's been shackled with her mom in the funny farm.
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
It's not enough to kill her own brother.
"Ah, maybe yes, when you consider"
That now she's the only one that stands to
Inherit the whole Ramsey estate.
"Otis, I think you're the one that's crazy."
Maybe I am for listening to you.
It just doesn't make any sense.
"Well, anyway."
Wait a minute.
What about that Hester woman?
"I mean, hell, she's the one that's got all the money."
And she's still alive.
Yeah she sure is.
Hester is still alive.
And she's got no kinfolk.
Except that Audrey girl.
You know something?
"Maybe we ought to go after her, talk to Hester Ramsey."
Might give us some background information.
My god.
"That college education wasn't a total waste, was it?"
Why don't you give her a ring?
"Hell, I've been dying to see the inside of that house"
Ever since I was a kid and used to steal
"- He died, Dad."
"Well, he should have spoke up!"
Squeaky wheel!
You're my squeaky wheel.
And you were magnificent.
Sometimes a man's got to do what a man does.
And a man feeds his family!
I'm taking you all to dinner!
- Yeah!
- All right!
"Frank, a restaurant?"
Isn't that a little extravagant right now?
"Oh, we're fine, Sue."
"This might be the adrenaline shot to the heart speaking, but I feel great again!"
"- Ooh, can we eat there?"
"- No, that's a titty bar now, Bill."
Your old man is gonna take you to the fanciest place in town.
"And so, you know, I had nothing better to do,"
"TV was on the fritz, so I figured, yeah, why not?"
I might as well get married.
It's funny when you pretend you hate each other.
Tell us the real story.
- It was such a lovely summer day...
- I'll take this whenever you're ready.
- Thank you.
- Your father looked so handsome.
"Grampa Joe walked me down the aisle and I wore my mother's dress, little Cindy was the flower girl, Monsignor Kreger married us."
- Who?
- He's Father Pat's father.
Long story.
And of course I didn't know then that you three angels were coming.
But I looked at your father
It was just so unoriginal.
Made me feel sorry for him.
My second husband was a pinch more creative.
Cheated on me with my sister but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious.
"So at least some mind games, some intrigue."
"But my last husband, he was a gem."
He was a veritable master at covering his tracks.
"I mean, I pored over his phone records, I intercepted his credit-card bills I had him followed on numerous occasions and never found a single shred of evidence."
It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress.
"But the real master, I have to say, is me."
"Three husbands, countless boyfriends, I haven't been caught yet."
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God."
"- Oh, my God, oh, my God."
I can't...
- Shh.
BEN:
It's over there.
ANNA:
"Oh, my God."
He liked the demo.
I can't believe it.
It's unbelievable.
Did you hear when he said that it was hauntingly beautiful?
"Yeah, I was there."
I was...
"I was there, baby."
Thank you.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
"Dana, I'm working."
I'm still going over some offering statements.
Sloppy.
They must have been delighted that you showed up.
- You next.
- Me?
"Yes, yes, you."
Enlighten us.
Do.
"Um, OK."
I'm Tony Stonem.
I go to college...
I live in...
"I actually said enlighten us, don't bore us, Mr Stonem."
"Speak about yourself, about your motives, your drive, your animus."
"Don't know what animus means, do you?"
- Yes.
I know what it means.
"- Well, I'm relieved."
"You see because at this university, we don't have room for the inarticulate."
"I think I'd better go, then."
Bye.
Good.
"So Tony, you were about to tell us just how extremely clever you are."
- I'm not that clever.
"- Oh, he's clever all right."
Really?
Touching.
Sadly lacking in substance.
"At our university you have to have verve, a sense of charisma - intellectual thrust."
"And that's what we're here to do this afternoon, is find out whether you're a giver."
- Whether you're...
- Willing to sleep with the lecturers?
- I'm sorry?
I've been all over town and I've seen it all day.
I was cooking dinner that night.
I had to start braising the beef and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.
It was Michael's favorite.
I was making ziti with gravy roasted peppers string beans with olive oil.
I had some beautiful cutlets that were cut just right that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.
So I was home for about an hour.
My plan was to start dinner early so I could unload the guns Jimmy didn't want.
Then get the package for Lois to take to Atlanta later that night.
I kept looking out the window and saw that the helicopter was gone.
"Michael, keep an eye on the sauce."
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.
"I asked my brother to watch the sauce, and Karen and I started out."
"Oh, God. I see it."
"-Look, it's right there."
-Damn!
"Yep, that's it."
We gotta get to your mother's.
"See, I told you."
It's funny.
-lt's not the end of the world.
-We're going to your mother's.
Tell your mother not to touch anything outside of the house.
Nothing.
Couldn'tve gone to your mother's house?
You had to come here.
"♪ ""Everything's gonna be all right ♪ ♪ this morning"" ♪"

"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I Iove, that is all."""
"""But I Iove strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
like that dreadful woman writes.
- If you can call her a woman.
- George?
"She makes a great hash of her life, but she's got a good heart."
That's why so many men don't want to let go of her.
George knows how to love... while she loves.
The countess has an extraordinary style.
I'd not have guessed there was a volcano under that ice.
"We can't find anything, citizen."
The viscount has been completely obliterated.
- Good to see you.
- Good evening.

follow me.
What the devil...
"Good God, CIaudette!"
Go back upstairs and change!
- Pooh!
- Ow!
hello!
welcome.
"well, he left the salon at that moment."
CIaudette's decided to dress as a man for some reason.
Do you want a drink?
- No.
"Not a problem if you are, just be harder to join in some of the banter."
"Any part of car mechanics you're interested in, as it goes?"
"To be honest, none of it... as it goes."
"- More interested in bikes, is it?"
"- No, the media."
Or law.
"Look, no offence, but I'm never going to work in a place like this."
- Place like this?
"- You know, a place like this."
"Manual, dirty."
"Not stupid exactly, but not academic by a long chalk!"
"It's not that I'm better than this, it's just that I am much cleverer than you need to be to work here."
Steve here's got a BTEC.
Exactly.
"I suspect the mix-up'll be sorted today, I'll be gone tomorrow."
I see.
You don't mind helping out today then?
"No, course not."
"Just the once, eh?"
"Right, Cholmondley-Warner."
We need some stuff picking up from the suppliers.
Fine.
I'll just get a pen and paper.
Great.
"OK, we need two tins of tartan paint."
Tartan paint times two.
- Spirit level bubbles.
- Bubbles for spirit level.
"- D'you need anything, Wolfie?"
"- Yeah, ask him for a reach around."
- A reach around.
- I thought you didn't do that anymore.
"No, that was the new Seth Cohen."
"I'm back, Ryan."
"Cohen Classic, red, white, and me, come on."
Hang in there.
I won't be gone long.
- Did the light of dawn make any of this a little easier to take?
"- Harder, actually."
- So what are you going to do?
- I'll tell you this.
- I'm not going back to the office.
"I may tolerate Julie as my stepmother, but I will not suffer the indignity of her being"
"- Well, there's a concept."
"- Come on. you and me, a couple of bathrobes and black socks?"
- The thought of that is so...
- Liberating.
- Scary.
- Forget the black socks.
"Barefoot, baby, barefoot."
- I can't be unemployed.
I-I can't even take a vacation for more than a we
"- A vacation with you is no vacation, what with the itineraries and the sightseeing."
- I just...
I can't have worked this hard
I don't know.
Can't quit.
Can't go back there.
"Well, I don't know, either."
What I do know is...
I'm not the one you should be telling this to.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Please let me play till that match.
If it's tennis you can still play in high school.
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
Swing the racket for me to see.
Your Zero-Shiki Drop Shot.
(Zero Degree Drop Shot)
Stop.
Being your therapist I can tell you that this is your limit point.
That move of yours will add on to your injuries.
You must not use the Zero-shiki Drop Shot under any circumstances.
Alright?
Hi.
What's the matter?
Have your injury recovered?
All thanks to you.
Recover well.
Competition is one week away.
Up or down?
Up.
- Up.
- I will serve first then.
Let's have a proper match.
"As the captain, you'll lose face if you don't win."
Give me all you've got.
You sure?
"Echizen, you're strong but if you don't get better, we will not win in the Nationals."
Give me your best shot.
I won't go easy so give me all you've got.
"Give me all you've got and improve yourself, Echizen."
Why did you transfer schools?
Didn't it cross your mind that the Nationals are filled with the best players.
- Even stronger than yourself?
I have even pleaded.
Now I shall use my hands.
Ouch!
"Hey you, now when your boss is getting beaten.."
..you are planning to escape?
"Hey, Iet me go."
"I swear on God, brother you have shown such a nice.."
"..programme, wont you tell me your name?"
Krishna.
I think you are new in Mumbai.
"And you still havent got a place to stay, right?"
You also look hungry.
This means that you are a decent man.
"Brother, all this comes Iaterfirst tell me.."
..what are yourfuture plans?
I mean where will you go?
-Wherever my legs leads me to.
Thats good too.
"Then brother, tell your legs to follow me."
My mansion isjust around the corner.
"No, I dont want to be a burden on anyone."
And when my family threw me out of the house..
..I dont share any relationship with you.
Why dont we share a relationship?
We do have a relationship.
"Look you are poor, I am poor."
"And I swear on God, brother the relation.."
..a poor shares with another poor..
..is greaterthan a brother-brother and father-son relationship.
And the truth is I swear on God..
..you have made a place in my heart.
Come.
We are so overdue for this.
Ah.
"Sun, sand, warm, blue water..."
It's not as warm as you'd think this time of year.
Tony!
I thought I was gonna be stuck all by my lonesome when they announced
"Dad's flight took off late, when what should appear but a Thanksgiving miracle!"
"Agent DiNozzo, I presume?"
The elusive Jake.
It's nice to know Bishop hasn't been catfishing us all year-- I was starting to wonder.
"Well, you can stop wondering, Tony."
"As you can see, Jake is quite real."
Unless he's a hologram that can shake hands.
NSA's actually working on one of those-
- I've seen the prototype.
"Yeah, that'd be pretty fun."
Really?
No.
Ah.
Aha.
Had me for a second.
That's too bad-- 'cause I'd like one of those.
I like him.
He's quick.
"Hey, speaking of quick, how'd you get all the way up here?"
Arrival pickups never get past Customs.
"It's all about the badge, Bish-- you got to know how to flash it."
Oh.
"Oh, my."
The classic Smelly Guy.
Yet another vivid hue in the broad spectrum of airport humanity.
Did he come straight from the gym?
"In fact, there are loads of cool changes you could make now you're in charge, Rambo."
"We could have - I dunno, comfy chairs, working toilets, non-squeak doors..."
"What do you mean, 'in charge'?"
"If you lower the price of grain, people will buy more."
"Whoa, steady on, Professor."
I don't get any of that business-y shit.
I said I'd leave all that to Flavia.
He's just a dickless intern!
Flavia is out of touch.
"She just sits in her office getting her nails done, while the staff get bad backs and blocked-up bogs."
"Sorry, Prof. I promised my dad I wouldn't rock the boat."
I did that at the shipping company and three people drowned.
I should just keep my head down.
Sorry...
Do you own the company?
Big time.
"Right, well, in that case, I will keep my jug still."
Sorry for calling you dickless.
"Yes, congratulations, boss!"
Great throw!
From downtown for five points...
Interception!
Turnover.
Interception?
Since when?
Just now.
He shoots...
He scores!
That's eight-all.
"New ball, please, Prof. Uh-huh, coming up."
We should make it doubles!
Then we'd have someone to pass to and high-five!
So I had to give you some sympathy points.
Can you stand up?
Do you need me to help you up?
I must learn well.
"Someday, I must possess acting skills comparable to this guy's."
"- When I said laughable,"
- Everyone together...
I didn't really mean it's funny.
I meant it's an embarrassment.
Do you understand?
Embarrassment?
Is it as bad as that?
It is.
"To me, it is!"
You're not allowed to leave!
I want you to wear the Love Me Dept uniform with me and be my nice partner.
"Gong Xi, I have run out of other options now, so I'd like to ask you to help me."
See if you can completely undo the knot in Mary's heart.
Don't rehearse anymore!
No one wants to watch such an idiotic show!
"Mary, how can you be so disruptive?"
I also think that the jie jie's response isn't very rational.
Let's see you act it out.
Show us how you'd interpret this Lola who resents her little sister.
Daddy will not forgive me.
Mommy's death was an accident.
It wasn't your fault.

Love is a solo show.
Solo Solo.
"For you, I want to..."
Solo.
Bevan?
"Yes, Bevan."
"Bevan, yes, yes."
"Bevan, your boyfriend Bevan."
Fiance.
Just rooms and rooms full of bleeding saints and fat cherubs.
"There's this room full of these Goya sketches, sort of man's inhumanity stuff."
I could hardly breathe.
Felt a bit the same when I saw Pica's stuff.
Did Goya murder kids too?
No.
And you don't judge artists by the way they live their lives.
"I don't care if he can sing, write, paint and dance all at the same time."
An arsehole's an arsehole.
Isn't it time you went on a diet?
"No, I'm a good weight."
How long have we got this room?
How long does it take to fix cancerous testicles?
Oh.
"Oh, geez, Keith must be pissed."
He never used the bloody things when he had 'em.
Found out what our boy did with his money.
Yeah?
"He paints a masterpiece, sells it at grunge markets for a fiftieth of what it's worth, then wanders around the city handing out wads of cash to homeless people."
Jesus Christ.
We're defending Jesus Christ.
I don't need money.
"That was Denny Lorton, my previous life."
Now I find it an intrusion.
So that's what you were doing in a lane that night?
You were giving Ben Rigby money?
I'd been told about him.
I wrote this song about
An 11-year-old girl who wanted to be a rock star.
"But she also wanted a normal life, so"
She pretended to be somebody else and
"That was great for a little while, but"
She's 17 now and life is even more complicated.
And she just doesn't want to pretend anymore.
Her name is Miley Stewart.
[Audience gasps]
Whoa.
Take that kitty cat flushing a toilet!
[Laughing]
Anyway.
"It's been a long time since I've sung without my friend here, so"
I hope you like it.
"[Singing ""Wherever I Go""] Oh, yeah."
Here we are now.
Everything's about to change.
We face tomorrow as we say goodbye to yesterday.
A chapter ending but the story is only just begun.
A page is turning for everyone.
"So I'm moving on, letting go."
Holding on to tomorrow.
I've always got the memories.
While I'm finding out who I'm gonna be.
We might be apart but I hope you always know.
You'll be with me wherever I go.
Wherever I go.
So excited I can barely even catch my breath.
We have each other to lean on for the road ahead.
This happy ending is the start of all our dreams.
And I know your heart is with me.
I was a friend of his and... that he talked about you a lot.
He wanted me to give something to you too.
What is it?
It's the new Barbie Sunday dress.
- For real?
- Yea.
I think it should fit.
There's something else in there too.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
"Your father was a good guy, April."
He told me how you two got lost in the mall one day and then had ice cream.
Well...
See ya.
Barbie Sunday show cancelled
What are we going to do now ?
I'll think of something.
Cold Pizza And A Warm Puppy
What's funny?
Russ didn't tell you ?
"Tell me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
He didn't tell you about Pete ?
No .
Who is Pete ?
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible because he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
What did he do ?
He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and the sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while, he heard a voice inside that said:"
"I would have preferred him to be guilty, but alive."
This hanging is a horrible story.
It's not our fault.
We should have better monitored him.
"You, especially."
"You're my assistant, right?"
I can not have eyes everywhere.
"So when the judge will be here, be available to him."
With deference.
"Otherwise, you will return to ""La Santé"" jailhouse."
If you knew the trouble I was given to be posted here.
This is an entry permit.
Mr Fandor?
"It is unfortunate that the procurator authorizes a journalist, especially today."
I know you really want to kiss your brother but will you be able to endure the test?
Open the door.
Nibet.
"We lay back Mr Dollon on his bed, Mr judge."
He seems to sleep.
"Damn, the dead has left."
"Listen, let's be serious,"
- you're in the wrong cell.
- But no!
You see that he is not here.
He was here a few minutes ago.
You're fooling us..
He was moved elsewhere.
Impossible.
I'm the only one with keys.
Anyone know where the corpse from cell 12 is?
No one came.
The dead was here.
She was everything to me...
Everything.
Stanley is 22?
Yes.
"We were courting when Peggy found she was expecting, so, yes,"
I did the decent thing.
But that doesn't change anything.
I'd have married her anyway.
"I loved her, always did."
Were you aware of the changes your wife made to her will?
Spencer is a swine.
"I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn't listen to me, and so now..."
Half the hotel.
How do you expect me to go on living when...
Everything I care about has been taken away from me?
Do you cure your own meat at the hotel?
What's that got to do with anything?
Would I be right in thinking that?
I don't know.
Yes.
Margaret was in charge of the kitchen.
Thank you.
"Christopher, I'm afraid I've got some bad news."
"Sir Ernest bannerman, the mp at the white feather, he's managed to pull rank."
"He's made some phone calls, and the long and the short of it is I had to release the lot."
Ok.
They've all gone?
"Yes, they went this morning, except Spencer."
"He's here, and he wants to talk to you."
All right.
"How can I help you, Mr. Spencer?"
"You're holding my assistant, and unless you're going to charge him,"
There's a field drag effect too.
We're having to use a lot of power to maintain our speed and heading.
"Avon, I saw Mandrian with this."
Then he put it back in the bottom of Sara's flight bag.
What is it?
That's what I want you to tell me.
[ALARM]
Look!
Filtration malfunction.
We'd better get down there.
- Dr Kendall wants you.
- Filter plant?
There's been another killing.
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
[ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE]
Tell me what happened.
"I was coming past, and I heard a noise."
So I looked inside.
Mandrian was just as you see him.
"Sonheim was standing over him, with this dagger in his hand."
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him!
Power reserves are almost gone
"In 103 minutes, it will no longer be possible to operate force wall and main drive simultaneously."
Please decide which to close down.
Without main drive we'll never get out of this.
Without the force wall we'll be smashed to pieces!
Have the locators detected the outer edge of the storm yet?
No.Yes!
No.
Maybe.
"Which is it, Vila?"
"All we know is he's got a gun, maybe worse."
Gibbs says he's got a backup unit on the way.
We don't make any moves until they get here.
I'm gonna let McGee know.
I can't believe you do this every day.
"Well, not every day, and not like this."
You sure we're not too conspicuous?
Not if we stand here like we're just talking to each other.
We are talking to each other.
You two with NCIS?
I am.
Special Agent Ellie Bishop.
Special Agent DiNozzo.
And I'm Jake Malloy.
Lieutenant Janet Lewis.
"Now, where is this alleged imposter?"
He just went into the men's room.
Calm and cool.
Secure this whole area.
No one enters until I say.
Not quite the cavalry we were expecting.
"Yeah, well, I expected to be home right now getting my cranberries started, but we can't have everything."
You have your service weapons?
"Oh, not me."
"I'm a-an attorney, with NSA."
"Attorneys stand over there, please."
Be careful.
I will be.
Adorable.
"Okay, now, let's keep our weapons out of sight until we get in there."
Last thing we want to do is panic this crowd.
Can't we just evacuate this terminal?
- How'd you know I'd be at this one?
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.
"You like rooftops over windows... you like angles with the target on your right-hand side, 'cause you're left-handed."
That's right.
I knew I liked you.
Put it on.
"Michael... is this what you really want, huh?"
Helping out civilians with their little problems... trying to get your government job back?
It's pathetic.
You're better than that.
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.
I gotta turn you in.
There'll be questions.
It'll be past lunch before we're done.
Turn me in?
"Sure feels good not to be the gayest guy in the room, for once."
"No, you're still the gayest."
Louis!
Go kiss Eugene!
So funny I forgot to laugh.
Meanwhile... our plan is down the poopster.
- Not necessarily.
"- What are you thinking, Gourishankar?"
"You said Ralph's boss had a guy fired for being a homosex, right?"
We send these photos to Ralph's boss.
He get Ralph fired for being a homosex.
That create an opening with Mick Jagger.
"They fill that opening with their only floater,"
Mr. Rockefeller Butt.
"But wait a second, we can't just out this guy."
Why can't we out a homosex?
"Ooh, but there is a ""Whittle Your Own Banjo"" workshop at 5:00."
I have whittle-to-no interest in that.
"Ooh, it says they have the loosest slots around."
I guess the Darby sisters from my hometown are here.
I did see a bunch of lounge chairs over by the swamp exhibit.
"I guess we could sleep there tonight, and then the next night, well, hopefully we'll be dead."
"Come on, red!"
"Max, no!"
That's all of our money!
No more bets.
"Oh, that is so stupid, and not cute stupid like when you thought Velcro grew in nature."
And red is the winner.
"Well, rootin' tootin'!"
"I always bet on red because my last name's Black, and that's ah-not been a winner."
"Okay, now that we've doubled our money,"
- maybe we should stop.
"- Come on, red!"
- No more bets.
- No!
I didn't even get to touch it before you lost it.
Why do you hate having things?
Red again.
Just call me Al Roker 'cause I'm making it rain.
"Max, we're winning at something."
"Don't just stand there looking pretty, toots."
Order daddy some wings.
"Oh, my God, I look pretty and I get to flag down a waitress."
Waitress!
I'll have a sarsaparilla and some wings for big daddy.
Sophie's calling.
"Pfft, like I'm gonna get it."
"Well, Caroline's not answering."
Why?
Did something happen with SBK?
Nope.
Something happened with Chivonne.
There's a banger.
Lucien.
"He a player, runs some corners."
He got it in his head that Chivonne is gonna be his girlfriend.
And he don't care what she got to say about it.
What do you mean?
Happens sometimes.
"Youngblood sees something he likes, decides it's his."
Doesn't matter that she don't like him.
It don't matter that she just 14.
"One way or another, he gonna get what he wants."
"Now, this boy, Lucien, he keep coming at her, got his boys following her, just making her life hell."
Did she talk to the police?
You mean did she snitch?
No.
"She worried that it's gonna come back on her and her aunt, and it would."
That's why she came to me.
What did she ask you to do?
I wouldn't let her say the words but I know what she need me to do.
And truth is...
I want to do it.
That's my baby girl.
"Anybody mess with her, they deserve what they get."
"Crazy, huh?"
"Everything I've been doing, working with you, working with the police, it was so, eventually,"
I can be a father to her.
Turns out what she really need is a gangster.
I don't blame you for wanting to protect your daughter.
Please.
"Thank you, Sister."
"And you, Mother, for agreeing to see me."
"I'm sorry, but this is a personal matter."
"Don't worry, there are no secrets here."
"And, anyway, Sister Marie has taken a vow of silence, so there is nothing to worry about."
Please speak freely.
I may need your help soon.
"And I apologize if I'm being presumptuous, but... this is a place of God, and..."
Yes?
"If there were any other place my friends could turn, believe me..."
You need us to hide some people who may or may not be in trouble with the authorities?
I'm not sure that they will be free to come.
- A very small number of them.
- Men?
"Yes, but only for a short time."
I'm so sorry.
But I can't.
"Mother, please!"
They'll be recaptured in the woods or killed.
The Germans are very thorough.
Every inch will be searched.
These men will be found.
"When the sisters of the Abbey St. Germain were caught trying to hide refugees, only four Sisters were left alive that night."
Barely.
I'm so sorry.
I will pray for them.
"For you, in this fight."
But I cannot let anything happen to the Sisters in my care.
I understand.
Thank you.
You are very brave.
That's just how life is though.
- A marvelous woman with a marvelous voice and a marvelous song.
Nora and the Pope dancers!
Everything gets to the point where I just say stop.
I'll play along for a little while.
To take advantage of this would be wise.
As long as I'm a part of the game.
"- If I were to leave, I wouldn't know where to go."
"If I order a schnitzel, she says I'm too fat."
I should get myself something vegetarian.
Why is it my mother's business what I eat?
- I don't get involved with her life.
I don't tell her what she should and shouldn't eat.
You also have a mother who's sticking her nose in everything?
... for such a long time.
Shall I leave?
- It couldn't do any harm to have men and money on your side.
"Here, just give her a ten."
She doesn't need money.
What's with you!
?
Why are you taking my money?
What are you doing here?
He shouldn't be giving her money.
She doesn't need money!
"Please, goodbye, and thank you."
Here comes another one.
That was Nora and the Pope dancers!
"Now, ladies and gentlemen..."
"And now, yet another dream comes true."
- It's finally here!
What we've all been waiting for.
I'll get rid of all the weaklings who have spent the last 66 years relying on other countries and other people to take care of things.
Given your outstanding ability to gather information I'm sure you can make any idea a reality.
just say the magic word.
Hey.
You selling?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ok.
That's cool.
"I'm just saying, you know, if you were selling,"
I could maybe do with a teenth.
"You're kidding, right?"
"Dude, I so smell bacon."
What?
What are you talking about?
"Gee, I don't know."
How about over there?
That brown van.
"- That's yours, right?"
- What brown van?
Parked all inconspicuous.
It's a cop van.
Another one right over there.
"""Duke City Flowers""?"
Come on!
Can't you at least be original?
"Dude, I just want to get high."
A flower van.
You know what you should do is a garbage truck.
Seriously.
"And I don't mean to disrespect, but if you put a bunch of cops in the back of a garbage truck, there's no way I'm seriously thinking that there's cops in the back of a garbage truck."
"It's a freebie, yo."
-So he comes again.
-Brought some pastries.
-Is he taking a nap?
-Yeah.
-Is he driving you to drink?
-I can drive myself.
I needed that.
What's the matter?
Spent a long time in the hospital last night.
The shit that goes on down there.
I wasn't expecting visitors.
How about those Mets?
Don't start with me and those Mets.
"You know, I was thinking about you."
-So you're drunk already.
-No.
I was thinking about the way you are.
"How you always have this little smile, like you got your own private joke."
"You don't talk much, do you?"
I wish I knew your secret.
Lose a leg and start making websites.
"That's the whole purpose for people like me, to inspire people like you."
"-Jesus, no offense."
-That's the trouble with you Americans.
You expect nothing bad ever to happen... when the rest of the world expects only bad to happen.
-They're not disappointed.
-That's a fucking grim outlook.
"You have everything, and still you complain."
You lie on couches and bitch to your psychiatrist.
You got too much time to think about yourselves.
Sounds like me all right.
You're not so bad.
It's a distraction for him.
Can you imagine the pressure that he's under?
"Plus, it means that Patty... whatever her name is is going to have to bear more of the burden, which is great."
She's never tried a case.
You've never tried a case.
I didn't go to Laverne Law School.
Wow.
"Look at you, so confident."
- [click]
- Lucy:
Thank you.
So McBride is going to file for a continuance.
It would be malpractice not to.
And I say that we oppose it strongly.
- Are you sure about that?
- Absolutely.
"Every single day that this case drags on,"
"Borns Tech is vulnerable to a decline in stock value, and that makes America vulnerable."
"I mean, letting a nobody like Billy McBride hold up a great corporation with a frivolous and ridiculous lawsuit?"
"It's not just wrong, it endangers everything that matters to our c-c... c-c-c... c-c... [deep inhale] country."
[exhale]
Ahem.
"Lucy, do you need me to fill a prescription for you?"
F-- [chuckle]
I'm fine.
Yeah.
You seem...fine.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I swear.
I'm fine.
Man:
Loads.
- Tell her how much you enjoy the work.
"- Oh, it... it..."
This... this job would...
You were inspired by Florence Nightingale to bring cleanliness to the wards.
"- Oh, God, you know?"
- Don't say God.
She might be religious.
Shit!
- God was better.
- It isn't a complicated job.
"I've done it before, I can do it again."
What more is there to say?
Oh.
I don't think there's...
anything more to say.
Knocked back from wiping up shite.
"Er... well, that was an inside job."
"They'll be forced to advertise for legal reasons, but a cushty number like that?"
"I mean, she'll have a mate lined up."
It'll be fine.
"I'm not quite sure how, exactly, just yet."
"But there is a perfect solution to this, and..."
Oi.
Trust your guardian angel to find it.
They shouldn't let your sort work in a hospital.
Our sort?
Does the FA Cup here make you wear that uniform while he's doing you doggy style?
"You're in enough trouble, young man, without getting pervy."
Trouble?
That's my dad up there.
This is no worse than a baby sucking its mother's tit.
I don't know how long its been since I've seen that.
You're like a miracle worker.
It's all a part of the process.
"But for now, your chest only, okay?"
It feels so good.
Could you maybe...
Not on the first visit.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.
"I know, but--"
What if this is the only erection I ever get?
I may not have another chance.
You will.
I promise.
Please.
"I wouldn't ask, except... it would mean a lot to me."
"I-I'm not a young man anymore, and..."
Please?
I do not understand it when we've gone over and over this time and time again!
I'm so sorry.
I-I--
You risked compromising his entire treatment!
And for what?
I felt he was so distracted by his need.
- I thought that if I just--
- You crossed a line that cannot be crossed.
And if the surrogate doesn't understand the boundaries--
"But I do know the boundaries, and-- and he did end up feeling--"
Do not tell me that it's okay because it worked.
You cannot play fast and loose with my patients that way.
I am sorry.
You're right.
I-I really apologize.
What?
You turned a block full of headlights on.
This should be easy.
Are you serious?
You said I look for ways to slack off.
This I take seriously.
"You have to challenge that brilliant mind of yours, and someone has to fill in for that Foss guy, right?"
"Well, that someone, my friend, will be me."
Really?
Just- make 'em blink.
Hey.
Is it working?
Not really.
Thinking about Amanda drained all the voltage out of him.
Oh.
"Yeah, I heard."
"""We need to talk. """
Sorry she left you hanging.
Typical woman.
"Um, anyway..."
I need to look for my digital projector.
"You giving that away, too?"
"No, I need it for a lecture I'm giving at U.W."
You're giving a lecture?
I mean... you're giving a lecture.
I've been asked to speak at a symposium tomorrow.
Are you getting paid for this thing?
"Because you're supposed to bring home the bacon, Dad, and I eat a lot of bacon."
"For your information, Josh, I have already had a job offer."
This lecture is about showing my expertise... for free.
"Well, I think your expertise is worth more than that."
"Thank you, Kyle."
You didn't call!
- Don't come here and intimidate me!
I waited all day.
Who are you?
How can you stand yourself?
"We tried to contact you several times, but we couldn't find you."
Come on.
You're filthy rich.
You could have hired an army.
It abviously took more than an army to find you.
To find a junkie drinking in India with hookers.
You hid my daughter for 20 years because I cheated once?
"Do you really think that's why, Jacob?"
Because you cheated once?
You're a very small person.
- What are you telling me?
- You're not listening.
- Then tell me.
Tell me!
- Let's all calm down a little.
Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant?
- We'd have figured something out.
- I didn't know until I got back.
I met Jørgen and...
"No, Jacob, I don't owe you anything."
You don't owe...
Aren't we talking about your daughter?
- Shouldn't she know her father?
"- She has a father, a good father."
I don't know what the hell to say.
What you did is so wrong.
"You know that, right?"
I'm home!
Welcome back.
"Good evening, sensei."
Good to see you Tomoko.
came to see me.
"She seemed very lonely, so I invited her to come see the ocean."
Oh.
Did you eat?
Yes.
Then you should take a bath.
"Alright, we'll practice more later."
Take your positions now.
Take a fan.
"You can hear the waves, can't you?"
"Tomoko, the time I've spent as your teacher will fade into the distant past."
"Since I was a child, I think I've been too dependent on the love and good will of others."
I think I got too dependent on the goodness of your heart.
I think that I hurt your chances of being happy and finding someone to marry.
"No, that's not true."
It wasn't a sacrifice.
It was I who was dependent on you and Shinako.
I didn't do anything.
"There's something worrying you, isn't there Tomoko?"
There's something I've been keeping a secret from you two.
What is it?
Do you have some problem?
"If there's something bothering you that you can't tell me about, please talk to Shinako about it."
I'll leave you two alone.
What's going on?
I'm drunk.
Oh.
"Mother, Takehara is over there."
Move out of the way.
You.
"Yes, you."
Get out.
"This is private property, get off it now."
Move!
Who let him in here?
Do you have any idea who that is?
That's Vigol from The Daily Mail.
All he's responsible for is stirring up trouble and writing malicious gossip like that bloody curse story.
Communication with the press is only allowed with The Times.
I will not tolerate any exceptions.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes.
- Where are you going?
"- Home, Howard."
I'm not a schoolboy.
CARNARVON:
Are you looking forward to the opening?
Everything's ready.
I've emptied it all out apart from the two guardian statues.
- I thought they should stay.
- Why not?
"You will cover up our little hole, won't you?"
I wouldn't want Lacau seeing that.
I wish we could get rid of that bloody man.
"But we have to deal with him, we mustn't forget that."
Try a little flattery.
Always works with the froggies.
You know you should never have signed that deal with The Times.
It's only made matters worse.
I thought it was what you wanted.
Let's go home.
"A peaceful, stay-at-home kind of day in a town  very much like your own."
"But then, suddenly, without warning atomic holocaust!"
But how does one survive an atomic attack?
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?
He says his boat ran into a sea monster.
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.
It was a metal meteor.
It ate his boat.
My dad says--
It wasn't any of those.
"What would you know about it, Poindexter?"
Don't make me come over there.
Hands over your head Keep low to the ground
Time to duck and cover The bombs are coming down
Duck and cover
It's about 50 or 60 feet high and it only eats metal.
"Shut up, you little spaz!"
It's been sent by foreigners to take over the country.
We should bomb it to smithereens before it does.
'Cause all the kids who don 't Will cease to be around
Thanks for the scrap.
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this...
... thislargebiteout ofit.
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.
-What could've done this?
-I told you what.
Strange invaders.
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.
Good night.
Lita.
[sighs] [elevator humming] [sobbing]
Lita.
[Sandover's voice] The perfect embezzlement.
It may be said that Rome was not built in a day.
"Well, neither was Fort Knox;"
neither was the treasure of the Incas.
"The undiscoverable acquisition of $201,000, bill by bill, month after month, year after year, is a financial feat worthy of Clem P. Sandover... [jazz playing] [clock ticking]"
- Having trouble?
- Oh no.
I do this for exercise.
It helps my strawberries get ripe.
Anybody home over there?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Why?
"Oh, I'm looking for real estate."
"Well, you can have any of mine, this truck included."
You know this is the second time in three weeks that I've missed the early market?
You know how long I've been asleep in that cab waiting for it to be light enough to fix this thing?
[jazz playing]
[song repeating] [engine revving]
Lita Krail murdered?
She-- she can't be.
She just can't be.
"Beth, why are you so frightened?"
"Last night you told me that you didn't like her, that you didn't trust her."
It's just that I can't believe it.
I'd like to talk to your husband.
He's-- he's gone out already.
I-
- I don't know where.
"Hey, Ken."
- What's up?
- You're getting skinnier on me.
Yeah.
Where's my money?
Your friend was late four hours last week.
And he's late again today.
I see... go have a talk with him.
The talk is happening right now.
You're going nowhere until Clive gets here.
"# Yeah, the kids call him Conejo #"
# 'Cause he was fast on his feet #
# And he was quick with his fists If he had trouble in the streets #
# But when his old man would hit the bottle #
# He'd kick Conejo's ass #
# And with a wounded heart Conejo swore he'd outrun his past #
"# Run, Conejo, run #"
"Never seen no speed limit on this road, Sheriff Kilbaught, so I... so I made a... a modest estimate."
"Never been anything modest about your modesty, Clive."
"This truck don't go a mile over 50, Sheriff."
"Now, you were driving a different truck this morning."
"I've been watching you the last few weeks, driving back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"Now, we both know there ain't nothing in this town worth taking a second look at."
Yeah.
"That against the law now, Sheriff?"
"Okay, come on, out."
Even your mama thinks you're a piece of shit.
You don't belong here.
You got me thinking.
Two trucks...
hauling the same junk in the same day?
"Sir, uh, turns out the camera's broken."
Sometimes the things you think are going to work don't work out at all.
"Son, it's a party-- lighten up."
"Whoa, where you going?"
Where you going?
Where you going?
"- I little wine, if you don't mind."
"- Oh, here's one."
Here you go.
Julian... why don't you show my dad that new sketch you did for me?
"You know, the one in my bedroom."
"Oh, yes, perhaps you can help me name it."
"I'm torn between ""Lame Excuse"" and ""Transparent Distraction."""
"Julian, just give me a second, okay?"
"First of all, I'd like to make a little toast, everybody, okay?"
It seems that some magazine decided that my daughter is a great catch.
"I don't need a magazine to tell me how great she is-- she's beautiful, she's bright--"
I'm damn proud of her.
- Hear hear.
"- Not done, Johnson."
Sh.
He is not done.
"Alex, I just want you to know that I couldn't be more happy if you'd find a nice fellow out there, someone who cares about you half as much as your old man."
He's out there somewhere.
"Hey, I know that ring."
Why do I know that... ring?
What the hell are you doing here?
"Okay, Dad, first--"
I loved your toast.
"Yeah, I heard it through the door."
"Very moving, sir."
Is there something going on between you two?
Johnny's build.
It might be Johnny.
It might not.
No hardware on him?
Wilson had a wristwatch.
Nothing.
He'd been cleaned as though somebody didn't want him identified.
"The only thing was a hunk of melted gold, like a tooth."
Only it's big f or a tooth and it's got some black stuff on it.
Black enamel and gold.
Johnny's senior society pin.
"So, Johnny had taken his last jump."
- What's it look like to you?
- Gold bullet?
Are you kidding?
That's an idea.
The newspaper boys will go f or that.
Kincaid would check with Missing Persons and find out I'd never been there but I wasn't worrying about that.
"I was thinking, now I won't have to say goodbye to Johnny."
I remembered him in Berlin.
The crazy song he always sang.
"I used to say, ""You drive me nuts with it. "" Yeah."
"Why, I used to say to him--"
"Let's just say I remembered Johnny, laughing, tough and lonesome."
Let's just say that.
But I knew all at once I had a job.
They don't give out the Congressional Medal to guys wanted for murder but he was gonna get it.
I was going after whoever tried to gyp him out of it.
Why should anybody kill Johnny?
Because he hadn't shot Chandler and maybe knew who did?
There was a photo in the Gulf City Statesman.
"Louis Ord, a waiter at the Sanctuary Club."
"Well as I am going below, continually below, that girl was laughing because of my touch."
- Interesting.
I dreamed things like this.
- Really.
And what?
"Is shivering even now my back, if I remember him when you touched my navel."
How do you fold that box?
What kind of work is this?
"Did you say something, kind Tót?"
"He said nothing, respectable major lord."
"Only...only...his new habit for him, that holds a piece of meat in his mouth and does not swallow it until clocks."
Well why does not spit it out?
"Spit it out if you cannot swallow it, my sweet good Lajos."
Show me
I think you understand that there is a limit to my patience.
I'm done.
"Oh, my God."
Is packing. he leaves.
What will be with our Gyula?
"You have to go in to it promptly now, you have to ask an apology."
- I do not go.
- But you go in.
Right now.
"- That god is not, that let me go in."
- Lajos!
- Daddy!
- Where are you Lajos?
"- What's up with you, daddy?"
- Leave me alone in peace.
- Think of our son.
"Our only son, my sweet good Lajos."
"The colds, the big Russian colds come."
Most people watch shows that are slightly too clever for them.
BOTH:
False.
You're going false.
What are you guys going to go for?
I...
"I think true because I think most people are watching at home going ""Yeah, cos I was actually going to say that, yeah."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
True.
You think true.
"OK, well I can tell you the answer is true."
APPLAUSE 56% of people think they're smart enough to win a quiz show.
APPLAUSE
My least favourite quiz show is definitely Countdown.
"God, imagine having to play THAT day after day."
LAUGHTER
"So, at the end of that round, it's no points for Rob's team and four points for Aisling's team."
CHEERING
"And The Winner Is, is the name of our final round."
Here's your question.
"People who can do, do you know poached eggs?"
"We can all poach an egg using the little boat, but using the swirling technique..."
"Aw, impossible!"
"Yeah, I try and it always ends up looking like a testicle with a ghost."
LAUGHTER
I made breakfast!
"When I was growing up, we used to be jealous of those rich kids that had, do you know like the motorized little BMW car things that they'd go round the garden in?"
"Oh, yeah."
"And now I can afford one, I can't fit in them."
LAUGHTER
You could get one for your own child.
"Nah, cos then I'd think, ""spoilt brat""."
And I think one of these men either has the coins or knows where they are.
Our deal was for me to find Marquesa.
"Well, I did that."
"These coins, however, present a whole new business opportunity."
So you want to be my partner?
This is the guy Marquesa went after.
That's him coming out of his condo.
I got names and addresses on all of them.
You need me.
Not anymore.
[Snarls]
[Growling]
[Beeps]
"So, Mr. Adams, you must have found something that wasn't good for you."
Adalind?
"Hi, Juliette."
I'm glad you remember me.
Of course I remember you.
"Well, I just wasn't sure if I should come by since things didn't work out with Hank, you know."
"Oh, stop."
I don't take my patients based on their owners' social lives.
"I'm glad you came in, and I'm glad you brought your cat."
"Well, I am relieved to hear that because Majique"
- seems to be pretty sick.
"- Oh, no."
What seems to be the problem with miss Majique?
She's just not herself.
She's sluggish.
She won't eat.
I'm pretty worried.
Do you think it's serious?
"Well, I hope not, but I'm probably going to want to keep her overnight to run some tests."
The midwife was Joanne Braxton.
She stole the dead woman's child?
It's the only birth she attended that fits with Roland's age.
And then she and her husband left the area shortly after.
What about Roland's father?
Is he still alive?
He is.
He was working out of the province at the time of his wife's death.
He never questioned the official report.
My God!
No one knows the baby exists.
No one misses him.
No one mourns him.
"He is yours, Julia."
Is this good news or bad?
What would William say?
He still doesn't know.
Keeping a secret this profound from him would be a betrayal of the trust between us.
But if I tell him...
He will feel duty-bound to return Roland to his father.
So leaving him in blissful ignorance could be the better path.
If you think you can do that.
Sir?
I found a missing persons' report that matches our victim.
- Who is it?
- A Hugo de Jaager.
Left his family home in Peterborough for Toronto a week ago.
Hasn't been heard from since.
- What's all this?
"- Sir, this is his research."
He told his mother before he left he was sure he was going to find her this time.
"- ""Her""?"
I always asked them if they wanted coffee.
"Some of the wives, like Mickey Conway used to curse at them and spit on the floor."
She used to spit on her own floor!
That never made any sense to me.
It was better to be polite and call the lawyer.
"♪ ""Happy birthday to you"" ♪"
We always did everything together and we always were in the same crowd.
"Anniversaries, christenings."
We only went to each other's houses.
The women played cards.
"And when the kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy were always the first at the hospital."
And when we went to the Islands or Vegas for vacation we always went together.
No outsiders ever.
It got to be normal.
It got to where I was even proud that I had the kind of husband that was willing to go out and risk his neck just to get us the little extras.
But I got Mom to watch the babies tomorrow night.
"-Can't do it, Karen."
-Why not?
I just can't do it. I got something lined up.
"Yeah, but tomorrow night's the only night she can do it."
-Pretty please?
"-Karen, I can't do it."
What do you want me to do?
-l got to go.
-Wait a minute.
"I wanted to go shopping, can I get some money?"
How much do you need?
That much.
This much...
Give me a kiss.
See you later.
Oh...all right.
MAN:
Careful!
It looks like there are four of these shrine covers before we get to the sarcophagus.
We still can't really work out how they ever got them in.
Getting them out without damage is proving to be the devil's own job.
Excuse me one moment.
"- So, can we repair this thing?"
"- Well, I'd like to see what Lucas thinks."
What's this?
Oh...
We found those yesterday in the treasury.
Mace thinks they're almost full-term.
The one on the left is a little girl.
You can still make out some of the hair on her scalp.
I think they're the saddest things I've ever found.
HOWARD:
I'm sorry.
(Operatic music playing)
- Mr Adamson.
- Mr Carter.
- You like Verdi?
"- Not particularly, sir."
But I find he's more effective than any guard dog.
The locals like him even less.
A lot of men would be nervous about sleeping overnight in a tomb.
"Yeah, the dead are dead."
I don't bother them and they don't bother me.
"Going well, sir?"
"To be honest, I'm a little disappointed."
"Oh, yes, sir?"
I thought I'd found him.
(Exhales deeply)
It's a no-brainer.
Run!
"Oh, God, no!"
"Okay, man, let's see him."
"Ma'am, had you ever seen him before last night?"
No.
What happened after you heard the sound?
I got the gun from the lock box in my closet.
Do you need the lock box too?
We'll let you know.
I moved toward the sound thinking that it couldn't be Chelsea because Chelsea comes up the stairs in a certain way.
I wasn't even supposed to be home.
"I saw the boy, he turned towards me."
Things like this aren't supposed to happen to people like Chelsea and me.
So how is Chelsea?
"""My mom is so brave, the way she defended our home."
"""She is my role model in all things."
"""I am so proud to be her daughter."
"""I only hope that in the same situation, I would have as much courage."" Thank you."
Chelsea!
Chelsea!
One more!
"Turn around, Chelsea."
Chelsea!
"Mom shoots a burglar, daughter holds a press conference."
I love LA.
"Evening, Counselor."
"Hey, you two got a minute?"
"I got a 314 awaiting a plea, but Morales wants a copy of your report on the Sennett house shooting."
"With all the press, he doesn't want to let it hang."
It's not as simple as it looks.
"The rest of the crew's still out there, and Chelsea Sennett's in too many right places for it to be a coincidence."
"So, anyway..."
It's really great to see you again.
Yeah.
"Yeah, you too."
Then...
You're happy?
Yeah.
"Like you said, It's all good."
"It's just... kinda hard knowing that I'm not even 30, and the greatest thing that will ever happen to me already happened."
"You take care of yourself, okay?"
Am I... the best thing that's ever happened to you?
"Baby, come on."
'Course you are.
- Really?
- Sure.
You're not counting playing in the Super Bowl.
"I mean, come on."
It's the Super Bowl.
But you're definitely number two.
"Oh, wait."
There's that million-dollar check I got for putting my name on that stupid barbeque grill.
That didn't suck.
"So it goes Super Bowl, big check, then you."
Dinner at the White House...
"When I was planning this party, I kept looking at these kids."
"And they're all smiling, and happy, and hopeful, and..."
"I kept thinking, ""How many of these kids are happy today?"""
I would say... all the ones who didn't come to this party.
I'm serious.
There were 28 of us in the class.
"How many of us are already, like, stuck in lousy jobs, or bad marriages?"
How many of us have already made that one big dumb choice we'll never really recover from?
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
- Excuse me?
- London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya.
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
- I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
- We need the information on Latif.
- And fuck you.
"Yeah, in latex, I know."
Shall we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
Dieter's file say that he was a chopper pilot.
"It's a long shot but they might have a bird out here, to extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange."
How unfortunate that you killed him then.
Is it worth a hand job if I didn't?
"Hello, Dieter."
I'm Colonel Grant.
British Military Intelligence.
Don't move.
"Please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you."
It's a very nasty way to go.
It's just insurance.
You were going to kill my men after all.
- No.
"We weren't, we..."
"- Shh, shh, shh, shh."
Now I can choose not to kill you.
So shall we discuss where your transport is?
-Why do you ask?
-Mm.
Might she remember?
"No, she was heavily sedated."
It's serious?
"Yes, I'm afraid it is."
-May I ask...?
-We still don't know.
Watch out for drafts.
A draft in the fall when the house is hot is a magic carpet for bacteria.
"Excuse me, madam."
Anything else?
"No, Karl, we're fine."
Thank you.
"It's all right, Karl."
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion... point one.
"point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
-The servants?
They have visitors?
-Not at all.
"Dominic Palladino, do you remember him?"
"-BE guy, a real juicer."
-He's in AA now.
I thought maybe I'd give him a call.
They can treat this shit nowadays.
Me with the competency hearings.
You with the head shrinkers.
This one in rehab now.
I was so upset when he didn't bring me a present back from Italy.
He got something for A.J. and for Meadow.
"He gave me some vinegar, but I don't think it was meant for me."
"It must've meant something, that he felt bad."
"Carmela, you sound like you're 15 years old."
I say I'm helping him decorate.
I bring A.J. with me.
Now even he smells a rat.
"If Tony suspects one iota, you know what'll happen to Furio."
These guys are living in a different century.
-It didn't stop you.
-Steve at the gym?
I felt so guilty all the time.
The lies and the sneaking.
It took Jackie going in the hospital to get me to stop.
-We haven't slept together yet.
-You're not fucking him?
So this isn't really real.
It is real.
We communicate.
He looks at me like I'm beautiful.
He thinks I'm interesting when I talk.
"Just those few minutes when we see each other, I live for those."
I feel like my life is slipping through my fingers and I will never be happy.
"Police are questioning the victims' acquaintances, and are expanding their investigation."
"Jung Ki-ho, reporting from Nam Mountain."
Sure you didn't do it?
I didn't.
- Then who?
- I don't know.
Are you sure?
"- You did it, didn't you?"
- Don't!
Why would I kill them?
I asked if you took my cellphone.
We will see a lunar eclipse within the next weeks.
The weather bureau reported that this will be the biggest...
This is my food.
Where have you been?
You scared me.
Have something on your mind lately?
I understand that kids your age want to hold on to a secret.
"Your father understands, okay?"
Thanks.
All I want to give you is one advice.
"Whatever you've eaten until now, whether it be raw or boiled, if you want to eat something from now on, you can't lick your chops, I mean, you can't eat it."
- Understand?
- Don't wake me up.
Can you breathe in there?
Where can I hide it this time?
You've worked too hard.
Who's there?
Surprise!
Happy birthday!
"I knew it was your birthday, so I wanted to surprise you."
Was it too surprising?
Shock pulses set!
Shooting now.
It's no good!
There's no response.
Raise the voltage.
But that would endanger the lives of the pilots!
N-No...!
Double...
Burning...
Crash...!
"So, it was the pulse that Romlin sent out that awakened them?"
All data concerning the stimulus points for arousing the pilots have been inputted into me.
Then why didn't you awaken Kuya?
"Well, uh..."
"Oh, Hitomi..."
Job well done...
"Well, I guess it's thanks to you we were able to win today."
I'll let you off the hook today.
Thank you.
Did you really think you could go scot-free?
!
No!
That's unfair!
Can this be allowed to happen?
You know...
Dr. Kazamaki and the Vice-Commander say they know nothing about you.
Uh-oh...!
"You tampered with the call when I made the check, didn't you?"
Uh... er... tampered...?
Isn't it time we all went home...?
I heard they were planning something like that.
"But when the prototype was made, too many problems cropped up, so the project was halted."
"What you did was righteous, but the magistrate will disagree."
Stay away from Ahsan for a while.
But...
"Wherever you go, whatever you do, don't lose the spirit and courage you showed today."
"And someday, you will restore your grandfather's good name and revive this clan."
You will be able to change the world as you so desire.
Father...!
Are we doing the right thing?
Let him go.
Heaven has made him with a purpose I'm sure...
"Forgive me, sir..."
Yi Soon-shin?
That bastard is out to destroy me!
"Yi Soon-shin, that bastard!"
Soon-shin!
Chun-su!
Where are you going alone?
"You're not running away without me, are you?"
Chun-su...
I'm coming with you.
I'm sick of this place.
What am I going to do here in Ahsan without you and without my father?
Soon-shin!
Soon-shin!
Let's stop and rest for a while?
"No, we have to be out of Chun-an before dawn."
But I can't take another step!
We have to go.
I can't!
Let me get a drink of water at least.
"Chun-su, let's get going!"
Hold your horses?
What do you know about a drug called Knipex?
Knipex.
"Ah, it's a dopamine agonist used to treat neurological disorders."
"Stops tremors, that sort of thing."
Wow.
Even I feel bad trying to win a bet against a guy who's sick.
But not that bad.
All right.
"Thanks, Mike."
"Hi, honey."
[Sighs]
I knew I'd find you here.
But you left so quickly last night.
"Well, I was trying to call that health inspector."
Do you know how much money we're losing every day we're closed?
"Well, listen, overseeing Wolfgang Puck's new place, plus Opus,"
"Mystique, all the beverage and food operations..."
"You know, maybe it's just, you know, a little too much."
Is that it?
What?
It's overwhelming.
You're letting things slide.
Slide?
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
That stuff happens.
Happens all the time.
"But the question is, how... how can we fix this?"
I cannot believe you have so little faith in me.
That inspector's just trying to get revenge on me for refusing to go out on a date with him.
"Come on, honey."
That report's a fake.
He made it all up.
"I thought I had lost him, but maybe Malvado can sense me getting closer."
"Wait, he can sense you?"
"He's a Lord, Richard."
He made me.
"So he can get inside your head, like you do to me?"
Worse.
"Well, can he sense other culebras?"
- Can he sense me?
- I don't know.
"I thought I knew what Malvado could do, but I guess I'm not so sure."
"Well, I guess we're gonna have to find out."
[Malvado] Of course.
Why didn't I see it?
"After all these years, only la diosa could come between you."
- [speaks Spanish]
- I don't speak Spanish.
"She's the sweetest kind of poison, the kind you crave."
She's the reason that my uncle is dead.
"True, and yet you, me,"
"Carlos, Richard, we're all fools for her."
No.
"I may be a selfish, backstabbing piece of shit, but I don't dig on your snake princess."
"I do, however, recognize her value."
I want ten million cash and a guarantee that you and your culebra cronies will never bother me or my girl ever again.
How do I know you even have her?
Figured you'd ask. [Whistles]
Give it to me.
[inhales deeply]
Your brother must be furious.
"Oh, I wouldn't worry about him."
He's just whipped.
Don't I know you somehow?
I'm calling the diner for help.
Han...
"Caroline, we don't have a good connection, and not just because we're dueling Scorpios."
Peek-a-boo!
I see you!
Oleg.
"All right, now do it with Barbara."
"Han, we had all of our belongings thrown out of a private plane."
"Caroline, you're cutting out."
"All I heard was ""private plane."" Brag much?"
"No, we need to get to Texas, so can you please put $500 in my PayPal account?"
What?
You have $500?
Did I call you to gloat when I bought this snazzy new vest?
I'm putting you on speaker.
Private plane...
Have... credit card...
We lost her.
Or maybe her butler snatched her phone from her.
"Oh, God."
He hung up.
"Max, can we just go back to that terrible place we call home?"
That mountain lion is wearing my new blouse.
And here she comes!
Keep the tags on if you wanna return it.
I'm calling the credit card company to send us new cards.
They're used to hearing me cry.
"So is the unfortunate family that sat behind us at ""Zootopia."""
"If animals can all get along, so can we."
"Look, once we get our cards, we'll be on our way to Randy in Texas... and what was in this for me again?"
5 1/2 near-death experiences?
"Hi, Visa."
No.
Why is everyone so obsessed with Amy and Stuart?
Whether or not they may be having more pumpkin lattes or intercourse tonight.
"Okay, listen to me."
Playing games is not gonna help get Amy back.
I am not trying to get her back.
"But, out of curiosity, what is a way?"
"All right, honey, let me tell you a story."
"There was a guy I liked, and I never told him how I felt."
"Eventually, he started going out with someone else, and I always regretted it."
Do you see where I'm going with this?
I believe I do.
Mm.
I'm the guy.
You're not the guy.
Are you sure?

I've got a copy!
Have a good trip!

"Im so good looking, I can put a rubber on and still get laid."
"From the look of the sores of your lips, you might want to put 2 on."
I still recall the taste of my tears.
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears.
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore.
Scraping through my head 'till i don't want to sleep... anymore.
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
"I'm down to just to thing, and i'm starting to scare myself."
"You make this all go away, you make this all go away."
I just want something...
I just want something...
I can never have.
You're a real jerk.
You wasted eight fucking aprons on this guy.
What's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.
It was a glorious time.
And wiseguys were all over the place.
It was before Apalachin and before Crazy Joe decidedtotakeon a boss and start a war.
It was when I met the world.
And it was when I first met Jimmy Conway.
but he was already a legend.
He'd walk in the door and everybody who worked the room just went wild.
He'd give a doorman $100 just for opening the door.
He'd give hundreds to the dealers and the guys who ran the games.
The bartender got $100 just for keeping the ice cubes cold.
The Irishman is here to take you Guineas' money.
Want a drink?
Give me a Seven and Seven.
I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
How you doin'?
Thank you.
Keep them coming.
Jimmy was one of the most feared guys in the city.
and doing hits for mob bosses at 16.
Hits never bothered Jimmy.
It was business.
But what Jimmy really loved to do what he really loved to do was steal.
He actually enjoyed it.
Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in movies.
Give me your wallet.
but we know who you are.
He was one of the city's biggest hijackers shrimp and lobsters.
Shrimp and lobsters were best.
I remember that a little bit differently.
Your parents didn't want you hanging out with me when I was pregnant.
Right.
But they came around eventually.
"Of course, I don't think you're their favorite friend."
Madison is.
Madison slept with your boyfriend.
But she didn't get pregnant.
And my parents like her parents.
"My parents like your parents, too."
"I don't think they'd go away on vacation with your parents or anything, but... (SIGHS)"
This sounds negative when all I wanted to do was say
I'm happy for you that Kathy made some friends.
"Now, I have to go meet Madison."
Why can't I go meet Madison?
Uh... 'Cause we're looking for guys?
(SIGHS)
Hi.
"Hey, Grace."
Hi.
"Um, I don't guess that you'd maybe want to do something tonight, would you?"
Tonight?
Yeah.
My mom wants us to try to be friends.
"Oh, yeah, I think my dad wants the same thing. (CHUCKLES)"
"Um, but, I mean, you've never not been my friend and I've never not been your friend."
"We haven't been close, but we haven't not been close."
"Right, yeah."
And I owe it all to you that I have a job at the church nursery.
I'll always be grateful to you for that.
Thank you.
"Although, being grateful is not quite the same as being a friend."
I don't think they allow tourists.
Exactly.
This isn't one of those tourist traps from the guide books.
Hola.
They don't allow talking on the floor.
You'll see why.
The lector kept the workers educated and entertained.
"Nowadays, most factories outside Cuba use iPods, but these guys still use the real thing."
I want to show you the storage room.
It's been around since the '20s.
After you.
- Go ahead.
- I insist.
Simon!
Simon?
We have to go... now.
Here we are again... another end.
When will I see you again?
"I need to go home for a few days, take care of some... loose ends."
But soon.
I got you a gift.
"It's nothing fancy, but it's a little more portable than a steamer trunk."
I love it.
"I finally did open that trunk when we got to London, by the way."
"My imagination had built the contents up so much, I-- my curiosity just got the better of me."
And?
What was inside?
Clothes.
"Not guns, not knives... clothes."
You were protected by your parents' love.
Love makes us do remarkable things.
"Oh, wait."
"I must say, ever since you started having regular intercourse, your mind has lost its keen edge."
You should reflect on that.
"Excuse me, but Einstein had a pretty busy sex life."
"Yes, and he never unified gravity with the other forces."
"If he hadn't been such a hound dog, we'd all have time machines."
Got it.
Bye.
You know I'm right.
I think he's getting worse.
"Oh, my metatarsal are barking."
- You okay?
"- Yeah, yeah."
I'm just breaking in some new shoes.
- Very pretty.
- Thank you.
Did you know that women wear high heels to make the buttocks and breasts more prominent?
Hadn't really thought about it.
Look.
"Uh, sure."
Very... prominent.
"Please, Leonard, don't leer, you have a girlfriend."
- Sorry.
"- So, are you off to dinner with Priya, Howard and Bernadette?"
Yeah.
How did you know?
"I heard it at the mall, when I was shopping with my girlfriends, 'cause, you know, that's kind of my life now."
Have a good night.
Try not to ogle my caboose as I walk away.
"- Hey, you."
- Hi.
"Hey, Raj, will you be joining us for dinner?"
The lonely guy and the two happy couples?
"Oh, no!"
Wilbur.
"Hello, Bob."
We'd better do something fast.
Gretchen thinks there's a man in here.
It's Willy.
Willy?
Willy!
Willy?
Hello.
"Oh, it's the kid!"
"You two know one another, huh?"
"Sure, I'm his part-time uncle."
I bought him his train ticket.
But what's he doin' here?
"He wasn't feeling well last night, so I let him sleep here."
And Gretchen doesn't know he's a little boy.
She was in too big a hurry to spread the word.
I'll bet you that board meeting's goin' on right this minute.
"Well, I felt it was my duty to come to you, the board, and... and give you an insight into the private life of Nancy Collins."
It's the most outrageous conduct I've ever heard of.
"Miss Brendan, you say you actually saw this man in her, uh... drawing room?"
"Oh, yes, Professor Okell."
"And when I confronted her with it, she hit me with a tray."
(MEMBERS EXCLAIMING) This is outrageous.
"No breath of scandal has ever touched the Brendan School for Girls, nor shall it now."
I move that we vote for the dismissal of... (KNOCK AT DOOR)
"Oh, I'm sorry I'm late, Mrs. Brendan, but I had a train to meet."
We were just taking a vote on the dismissal of Nancy Collins.
"Good, I'll vote, no."
You'll what?
Don't you think Nancy should be allowed to testify on her own behalf?
I'm very sorry.
Today is his first day.
He thought that was a stain.
"Damn it, does that make sense?"
"- Hey, you!"
- Yeah?
I'm going to poke your eyes out!
I must've scrubbed too hard.
Let's have a look.
"Now, a family of foxes will finally be shown to the world."
Think about your parents who bore you.
You're right.
Why did they make me like this?
What did they make you into?
I have to die!
I must die!
It's hot!
Granny!
You can't die now!
Not yet!
The Fox Family starts their day by making medicine.
This generous family takes in people abandoned by their loved ones.
"While taking care of them, their day goes by so quickly."
But they are so happy to do it.
Is this what a real family is?
Please give all our family much love and peace.
May their body and spirit be healthy.
Until the sun and moon meet on our 1000th year.
"Oh Jesus, Oh Buddha."
"Damn it, are they foxes or what?"
The city is terrified over the Nam Mountain serial killings.
"Since the victims were prostitutes, the police suspect the same murderer, and have focused their inspection in the Nam Mountain area."
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"Oh, come on, it was just a joke."
A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine...
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
"Then no, uh... no Stiles."
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
I love New York.
"Doing a show here, man."
"You know, 'cause sometimes I do shows in weird places."
"Like, I just came back from Seattle, Washington."
That place is weird.
"'Cause Richard Sherman is there, and I'm scared of that guy, okay?"
"'Cause he's so forceful for no reason, right?"
"""Well, when you put me up against"
"""a sorry receiver like Crabtree, that's what you gonna get!"""
"I said, ""Calm down."
"It's not that serious."""
"Ladies, let me tell you something."
"That's the type of dude, if he say you in a relationship, you's in a relationship."
There's nothing you can do about it.
"He walk right up to you, ""You coming with me."""
"You say, ""Bitch, I guess I'm going with him then."""
"""Fuck it."
"That's my baby now."""
"I'm serious, man."
"Oh, boy, it's so diverse in here."
I love it.
Ten Black people.
Thank y'all for coming.
It's--
"You aware that we are seriously a minority right now, and it's-- And it's cool."
"You know what, 'cause I love white folks."
"You gotta understand, I do."
"You know, 'cause when I first moved to New York,"
I moved into a dangerous neighborhood.
"And when I saw y'all walking around,"
I felt safe.
"'Cause I know when it all come down to it, y'all would get robbed before I will."
I just...
I don't think dinner tonight's a good idea.
"No, it's not a good idea at all."
I'm allergic to cats.
"Can we just, like, put them down until you're ready?"
"No, 'cause then they're likely to run away."
And then where are we?
Stuck with no cats.
Is everything OK?
What is this cat's name?
This little guy is called Prescott.
That was my grandfather's name.
"NARRATOR: 'For the first time in years, Ashley found herself feeling truly alone."
"'Despite being surrounded by people most of every day, 'she was unable to connect to them in a way she considered meaningful 'and found herself passing through their lives, and her own, 'in a state of total isolation."
What size are these shirts?
I don't know.
Small or medium.
Try it on.
I'll give you an ill-fitting discount.
They seem expensive.
Sold to the highest bidder.
- This too.
"- Yeah, why not?"
This?
Throw this in.
"It's not very good, but you can use it as a coaster or something."
No good.
Naw.
Take the jacket too.
Two for one.
Look at that.
"You would date that man, right?"
With the wedding chapel on it.
Would you guys find it!
"I love you, Roger."
"I love you, Babs."

You creep!
Babs!
Coach!
Enough!
"Ah, Magnum."
There you are.
"You realize, of course, you have no chance of winning."
"Well, Buddy's not saying a word."
Catching him with a gun is enough.
The guy's a three-time loser.
You know they're gonna put him away for life... probably 300 years.
"And the money, they still haven't found it?"
Roger didn't exactly give them a pinpoint location.
They're liable to be digging up that place till the next Iron Man race.
He seemed sure it was in the Bougainvillea Priscilla.
They'll find it.
And then we'll get married and go back to Bayonne.
"And I'll open an exercise school, and he'll open a little tropical flower shop."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
And everybody will come out of this pile of bat guano smelling like a rose except me.
"Just think, man, I'm the one that put up the money to sponsor you."
"You forget, Robin Masters made a sizable contribution without expecting any publicity for it."
Robin?
What about me?
"I put up the food, the booze, the potato chips."
"Stop it, all of you."
Tom did his best.
"Alright, see ya."

"If you're thinking of turning this into some kind of witch-hunt,"
We?
He isn't pissed at us.
You're the government agent.
He probably thinks we're all agents.
He believes almost everyone is.
- I'm not with any government agent.
- He's trying to confuse you.
I'm with you.
"Big Brother, right?"
"Newthink, newspeak?"
"Hate is love, war is peace."
He's laughing at you.
- Stop it!
"- No, Ted."
It's okay.
- He doesn't mean anything.
"- Yeah, chill."
I support you.
Screw the government.
Make him sit down.
"All right, how do we remove a microchip that's not there?"
His speech is lucid.
"There's no sign of neologisms, word salad or loosening of associations."
"As long as he can systematize, he'll be able to keep his thinking relatively organized."
Organized enough to see through any game we try to throw at him?
"And if he's convinced it's in his arm, and not in a place like his lower back or his neck..."
An incision means he's going to be watching.
Maybe we can just convince him that he's been looking in the wrong place.
Or we could fake it.
Conceal a chip in the palm.
A little sleight of hand.
"Come on, Reid, what are you talking about?"
"For Foon's sake, don't offend him, OK?"
But that's the fact!
Sorry!
...
Summon the witness.
I was washing rice inside the kitchen.
"When I heard the gun shot, I rushed to the backyard at once."
What did you see?
"I saw Ho Chun lying on the ground, with blood all over his body."
Foon pointed a gun at him and laughed.
"He said, ""Ho Chun, you are dead meat now."""
What's next?
I was afraid and screamed!
Ho Foon got mad and chased after us.
Objection!
What did you say?
What you've just said differs from the statement you gave to the police.
I just want to ask why you amended your statement?
"Objection substained, witness should answer the question."
I worry that Ho Foon will avenge me.
So I didn't tell all the truth.
"I have no question, it's your turn."
"I would like to show the jury the evidence, item number one first."
"Witness, this gun can shoot only one bullet."
"You said you heard the gun shot, so how could he shoot you again?"
He didn't want to kill me with gun.
But by what?
Sword.
Are you kidding me?
Really?
"He chased after me and wanted to kill me with ""capital chopper""."
"He chased after me, and I was so afraid..."
' This is what you did.
That's because...
I was shocked.
I didn't even really get to see anything.
Oh my God!
So... you and this guy...
haven't seen each other yet?
How can you be like that when you guys are getting married in a month?
Is that...
something a kid should be saying right now?
Just go and pack up some more stuff.
Teacher Gil...
You want me to show you?
My body is really rocking right now.
Look.
This...
Isn't a body you can get in a month or two.
-Look.
This guy's abs are like chocolate!
-Don't do it!
It's nice.
I wonder why this guy hasn't shown you his body that he's worked on?
"I thought since he took such good care of it, I thought it was to look good for you..."
Yoon Jae...
Likes to work out because he likes to keep himself busy.
That's right.
"I'm sure at the very least, he was diligent about working out every day for at least 2 hours."
"To be in that shape, do you really have to work out every day for at least 2 hours?"
Unconditionally.
He should've seen you more during those hours.
He must have given you excuses to take those hours to work out.
I guess to this guy...
"Well, your brother's quite a character."
"And your father, he seems, uh, driven."
"Anyway, it's good, Sam."
It's really good.
Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?
I can't.
I have to go into the family business.
Family business?
"Yeah, my dad's a--"
My dad's a mechanic.
So I have to be a mechanic too.
"Do you wanna go into the family business, Sam?"
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well?
"More than anything, no."
"You know I don't wanna, uh, overstep my bounds here but you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do."
"Look, I mean, I know what it's like."
"I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me."
"So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you."
The point is there are maybe three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life.
"And you need to be the one that makes them, not anyone else."
"You seem like a great kid, Sam."
Just live the life you wanna live.
We came back here so you could talk to the teacher?
He's a good guy.
"Well, whatever."
"Go have your Robin Williams, ""Oh, captain, my captain"" moment."
Just make it quick.

[SIGHS]
GIRL:
Just getting to know the city.
Is this a good spot?
"Well, you have to go where the darts are if you're in a darts league."
Big darts game tonight?
Match.
It's called a darts match.
Big darts match tonight?
"You know, the game of darts goes back to the Battle of Agincourt in the 15th century."
The first dartboard was actually the cross section of a tree.
Wow.
You're a real enthusiast.
I kind of like history in general.
I like the perspective on why things happen.
Never been my favorite subject.
"I do love old movies, like ""Casablanca."""
"That's kind of history, right?"
"Ms. Keyes, you are a breath of fresh air."
Call me Saffron.
We're not at work.
"Gary, more vodka shooters before I take your money."
"Your turn, big guy."
"No, no, no, no, no, no, my turn, my turn."
"And, um, when I come back, will you teach me how to shoot a dart?"
"Okay, but are you sure you don't want the reigning champ to teach you?"
Positive.
I imagine Gary knows what he's doing.
"Vodka, vodka, water."
Drink them under the table.
"Okay, okay, okay."
There's a lot of money on that table...
I'm nervous.
"No, no, I got your covered."
That's a biggie.
That's a really big biggie.
"I hope, nobody in this room is, planning anything for my birthday."
"Like what, Bob?"
"Oh, like people jumping out of closets, people jumping up from behind furniture... and, expecting me to be surprised when I'm not surprised."
"Oh, don't be silly, Bob."
"Now we agreed it's just gonna be a nice, quiet dinner with a few close friends."
"Yeah, the... quieter, the better when you're past 40."
Why celebrate?
"I mean, It's all downhill from here."
You're heading into the twilight time.
"You think I oughta cash in my chips, Howard?"
"I don't know, but I'd keep them handy, if I were you."
Okay.
"Here's your dinner, honey."
"Lettuce, cottage cheese, tomato, a slice of melon and some cold chicken."
- I hope it's all on your diet.
- A diet?
"What's wrong, Bob?"
"Oh, nothing."
"Bob just went for his physical today... and he's gotta lose weight, so he's gotta watch his calories for a while."
"Oh, That's bad."
"No, it isn't, Howard."
A lot of people are on diets.
"Oh, no, no."
This is a bad diet.
"I mean, Look at this."
"Cantaloupe and cottage cheese and tomatoes- I mean, it's full of carbohydrates."
"I mean, that's what you should be counting."
"- Well, what do you suggest, Howard?"
- Water.
You should drink water.
It's finished.
The taste is perfect.
Prepare your spoons.
Dig in!
I'll go in first.
He always makes his family status apparent.
"Even so, taking the egg yolk for yourself isn't right!"
"Senior, did you just dig in with the spoon you just ate with?"
Seriously.
I won't eat it.
We are doctors that need to keep our health in check.
How could we share a bowl with a spoon?
So I just starved instead.
"Nothing else is hard, but the fact that warm water doesn't come out and-"
You scared me!
"Honey, I will call again."
"Hey, you..."
Please give me something to eat.
"If I come here,"
I heard you guys give out something to eat.
I couldn't come yesterday.
Talk to me from there.
From there.
You can't go around touching people's clothes with those dirty hands.
Hey!
He vomited while suddenly fainting?
"Yes, he was lacking in nutrients so I gave him an IV bag."
His voice was normal.
It doesn't seem like pneumonia.
But it also doesn't seem like malnutrition is the only cause.
His condition is really bad.
Aches between the liver and stomach?
"Yep, today is your lucky day."
Awesome !
"I mean, wait, what do you mean ?"
"Well, first, we have to get rid of that dorky bow tie."
"Yeah, and an apron is friend to no man."
Surely we can do something with this hair.
"I think I have some nail scissors in my purse, hmm ?"
I can't get anyone on the phone.
"Eh, that's okay, I'll, uh, I'll walk you through it."
Just open up the back door.
"It's easy, don't worry about it."
"Ryan, you're asking me to use tools and exert myself physically."
I think we both know where this is going.
"Yeah, okay, well, uh, start by putting the jack under the frame by the, uh, by the door there."
Yeah.
"The jack is this thing with the handle, right ?"
Yeah.
"Actually, wait."
"First, um... loosen the bolts with that wrench."
All right.
There we go.
Okay.
"All right, you may find this hard to believe, Ryan, but when I was younger, I used to be a bit of a worrier."
You don't say.
"To distract myself from worrying,"
I would sometimes make lists.
Didn't matter what the lists were.
They could be anything...
every cereal
"I've ever eaten, or... uh, the names of every planet mentioned in Star Wars."
Whatever.Anyways...
"You want to make a list, Seth ?"
Because I'm a little kid; that's not fair.
"Okay, okay, fine."
"Okay, give it to me."
Isn't it a little early?
"No, what it is, is..."
A little cowardly.
"What it is, is selfish."
Your timing is impeccable.
I was a minute from making a clean getaway.
Your assistant told me where I could find you.
Sir...
We really need to talk.
So all I have to do to prevent this lunatic
From keeping his promise is step forward
And declare myself a criminal?
"He knows what you did, sir."
"I don't know how he knows, but he knows."
"And I know it, too."
"Look, I would never secon d-guess what you did."
I might have done the same thing.
And I know how much you stand to lose.
"But unless there's something I'm not seeing,"
I don't think you can keep this a secret much longer.
I think you need to start telling people what you did.
And not to give in to him...
But to keep him from doing something
That you would never recover from.
I mean...
If he hurt some girl...
I don't think you could live with that.
"There's a lot you're not seeing, allison."
But I appreciate your concern.
"We are gentleman adventurers on the road to great riches, eh?"
"Come, come, Kali."
My towel.
"Say, Jack."
- Buck's gone again.
"- Yes, I know."
- I heard his lady friend howling last night.
- Oh?
"Well, that's what happens to a fella when he gets in bad company."
Mmm!
Wait a minute.
"According to all you told us, and to all calculations... we should have located the mine two days ago."
"I'm afraid you're bringing out my worst side, Mr. Blake."
"- Yes, I-I know, but-"
- If you're trying to hoodwink us... we are certain to find it out sooner or later... and if such is the case... there is nothing left for us to do but mourn for you.
I swear I'm doing the best I can.
I followed the compass directions exactly.
The burnt tree.!
- The cabin!
That's it!
- My dear Mr. Blake... how can you ever forgive me for doubting your integrity?
You've placed me in a most embarrassing position.
I scarcely know what to say.
One for the master.
And one for the dame.
And one for the little boy who's filing the claim.
"Why, Jack, I never suspected."
The world doesn't understand me.
At heart I'm an artist.
"Oh, I want to write poetry."
I want to compose.
"I want to sing, paint."
"Then just check ,no opinion.,"
"I,m not checking anything."
"You can, if you Iike, but I won,t check just any box."
"This isn,t tic-tac-toe!"
"We,re getting off the point."
"We,re lucky this is on camera, or no one would believe it."
calm down!
Just checking.
"Let,s put 8."
I give up!
This is a loony bin!
"At the risk of being rude,"
"Jean-MicheI, last night you suffered once again from premature ejaculation."
Perhaps.
It happens sometimes.
"But I think you,re being judgmental or trying to annoy me, and that,s out of line."
"Listen, we practically live together, yet we hardly know each other."
"For exampIe, what,s your relationship?"
"I,m not sure how to take that."
"You know everything about us, but we -"
"Listen, Jean-MicheI."
"Let,s say you,re at the post office."
You wait in line.
You buy stamps.
"Do you ask the employee,s name or who they voted for?"
"I,m just saying it might be nice."
"well, what do we put down?"
I get it - another test.
"You,re trying to get us to crack."
- Is this on purpose?
- Where were we?
please answer me:
Because this man's wife had a tumor.
"What you had, Gordon, was a first-class migraine."
- I can write you a prescription.
- That'd be good.
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
"13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes."
"Again our top story, Domain Air flight 9 out of Denver has crashed."
"Sisters, you're about to make urgent use of your rush rotation skills."
We have an unexpected visitor in our mix namely dean Bowman.
"Our mission is to keep him occupied, failure is not an option."
Are you with me?
Good!
Let's move out!
Are you guys coming back?
Incredible!
And then what happened?
- I graduated from highschool.
- Highschool?
That's facinating!
"- And, then what?"
- I went to college.
So... so do you live around here?
"Dean Bowman, can I tell you what a privilege it is to have you at your party?"
What a great tie!
So?
Are you really thinking of joining the Kappa Taus?
I haven't decided yet.
What do you think about it?
You see how much fun we can have.
- I know you love strip clubs.
- Boobs.
You don't think it wouldn't be awkward though?
"- I mean, if we're dating other people."
- Doesn't have to be.
"You should meet Greg, I really think you'd like him."
"Yeah, it'll be a little awkward."
I don't want to change your mind or anything.
I really miss hanging out with you.
Me too.
That's a lot of money.
But not for Danny boy.
Somebody else can marry that teddy bear.
"I'll just take the $50,000 and-- [whistles]-- blow away."
Just thought I'd mention it to see what you had in your mind.
Yeah?
"You, uh..."
"You wouldn't be thinking of running out on me, would you, lover?"
Do I have a choice?
No.
Not unless you want the police in Chicago to know where you are.
"All right, you made me set it up for you."
"Look, Aunt Olivia's going to be wearing the diamonds, not Merle, so with that little piece of information, will you please just get out of here and leave me alone?"
"- And leave Merle alone, too."
- Okay.
Okay.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
- Danny.
How are you going to do it?
The same old way?
"You know, you're too much."
Get out of here and leave me alone!
"Leave Merle alone, too!"
"Danny, how are you going to do it, the same old way?"
"What do you think I am, a sucker?"
But I might tell a partner.
"Oh, forget I asked."
You're blowing a great opportunity.
"With all the contacts you can make with that camera and my talent,"
- we could retire in a year.
- I'm going to retire right after this one.
Then make it a good one.
"""Okay, sounds good,"" and he's gonna go off and do whatever he wants to do."
And you know that.
"So my advice to you is, please, get confirmation on these rumors, and get the truth, and share that truth with Steve."
Because you know and I know that he's not gonna stop until he gets it.
Are you sure it was Sato's men?
I don't know.
It could've been the Triads.
Here's what you need to do.
You need to get yourself out of Hong Kong.
"You got to get to one of Doris's safe houses, okay?"
No.
Kono...
"Look, not without Adam."
You're still a target.
They're not gonna take you off their hit list just because they already have Adam.
"I'm not leaving him, Chin."
"Kono, listen to me!"
What good are you gonna be to Adam if you're dead?
"Look, just get yourself out of Hong Kong, okay?"
Let us worry about getting Adam back.
He gave himself up for me.
He sacrificed himself so I could get away.
We will find him.
I promise.
"Now, please, will you do what I'm asking?"
"Cousin, I love you, but I have to do this."
(sniffles)
STEVE:
"Okay, listen."
HPD canvassed the area where our little car thief found the Impala.
"Unfortunately, there's no traffic cameras down there, so we're never gonna know who dropped it off."
What about you?
"Of course, Madame."
He loves me and I will give him the attention and affection that he needs.
Of course.
"Your Majesty must be tired, after such a long journey."
"Tired, yet reinvigorated."
"When I last saw you, Sire, you seemed..."
Lost?
"Now, I am found."
I want you to organize a banquet for this evening.
Send out invitations.
The entire court will attend.
"A fine idea, Sire."
"But first, tell me news."
All that has happened in my absence.
Hide nothing.
And your husband?
He grows sicker by the day.
The last few weeks are the worst.
It is too late to regret what you have done.
I regret nothing.
"But I will live the rest of my life, a murderer."
No.
You will live the rest of your life as a woman who defended herself.
Go.
The prodigal brother is returned.
"I understand you made a fine monarch, in my absence."
"I did my best but of course, I could not fill your shoes."
"Anyway, I thank you for your efforts."
You drove a good bargain and we now have a foothold in India.
All for the sake of France.
How was the war?
Exhilarating?
All right.
I got you.
Meth.
Right.
"Sorry, that was a little transpositional error."
Nothing a little Wite-Out can't take care of.
"Yeah, and felony quantity."
- Just barely.
"- Yeah, just barely."
The cops are like butchers.
Always got their thumbs on the scales.
But good luck arguing that in court.
Let me get down to brass tacks.
I'm gonna get you a second phone call.
You're gonna call your mommy or your daddy or your parish priest or your Boy Scout leader and they're gonna deliver me a cheque for $4650.
I'm gonna write that down on the back of my business card.
Four-six-five-zero.
Okay?
"And I need that in a cashier's cheque or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
"And make it out to ""Ice Station Zebra Associates."""
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"And after that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"
"What do I look like, your high-school girlfriend?"
"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
Come on.
What do you got?
A lot.
"AUTEC is, like, crazy amazing."
"You've got your Bermuda Triangle, your wormholes, you've got your magnetic field deviations."
Just wish there was a way to contain it all.
You're a mapper.
Oh.
I'm warning you.
You should get out of my head while you still can.
Can you map the bullet back to the shooter?
"Slug that killed Ridgeway, it's 30-caliber, definitely unusual."
The one thing I do know is that it's not military specs.
I'm still trying to track it back to the exact weapon it was fired from.
"Track faster, Abbs."
You know why you're so gruff all the time?
You need more sex.
I'm not answering that.
You just did.
"I am telling you, I saw a bounce in his step."
And Elliott...
"Elliott was sure about Ryan's pupils, as well."
How am I gonna survive Gibbs dating a woman who thinks I'm a game show host?
What does that even mean?
Does she think I'm cheesy?
That I like pencil-thin microphones?
"See, I don't buy it."
Gibbs is a lone wolf.
You have to be observant.
"Next time they come in here, you need to open your eyes and really look."
GIBBS:
"Okay, what are we looking at?"
I'm confident that there's no depravity
That brand-new e.
Braun sheets can't erase.
How many problems does Jenny have to cause
Before you realize she's the problem?
Hey.
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me here.
The library started Did you apply for a documentary internship in Haiti?
Yeah.
The producer just called.
I...
I got the job.
When were you planning on telling me about this?
"This morning,"
"And then you put internships on the ""do not discuss"" list,"
And I panicked.
Why?
Why?
This is not about competing for something.
This is-this is about our relationship.
"But both of those have been so tied up in each other,"
"And this job is a huge deal for me, Dan."
But you can't pretend like you going away for three months
Is not gonna affect us.
I think I didn't wanna face that.
It was just so much easier when we were just friends
And we could talk about things.
"All right, is-is that what you want, then?"
You wanna go back to just friends?
I don't know.
¶
He went to meet Mary.
"All right, let's go check out the Larimar."
"I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it."
"Okay, well, you did at one point."
Mary would never force anyone into this.
Why did you do it in the first place?
I work in the ICU.
I deal with the heaviest shit in the hospital...
"People at their worst, their most desperate."
"Before Mary, there was only so much I could do for them."
"Handing them that pamphlet, it gave them..."
- Comfort.
- Yeah.
Also I want a million dollars.
"Uh, what?"
I have financial goals.
How much do you have so far?
"Oh, come on, I'm not gonna rob you."
It's too much work.
- Not enough.
- Enough for what?
Freedom.
So you're breaking the law for freedom?
"The law is wrong, and it will change."
"Until then, there's no reason that I shouldn't supplement my income."
Then why stop?
I have this vision.
"Me, Mary, and now you, all of us in the woods somewhere, like a camp."
"No, a retreat."
A death retreat.
"People come from all over the world to experience the finest death possible, from the best of the best."
Sounds kind of nice.
You don't know how pleased we are to meet you.
Without you we'd never have come here.
You'll be much more pleased when you learn about the Ministry of Time.
There are hundreds of doors there that lead to all of the past.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
"And the guy in the German hell, covered in shit up to his ears, asks the guy in the Spanish hell how he's doing..."
I don't know what I'm doing telling jokes.
Not knowing what the Nazis are doing with Amelia.
"Continue the joke, I beg you."
The Spaniard says he's living pretty well in the Spanish hell.
"The German, dumbfounded, asks him:"
"""Don't they throw buckets of shit on you?""."
"And the Spaniard says: ""In Spanish hell when there's a bucket, there's no shit, and when there's shit, there's no bucket""."
Well I don't understand.
Fine.
I guess Spain's changed a lot since the 16th century.
"For the worse, as I see it."
It seems that they are here.
Let's go.
Could you shut up for once?
I'm sick of all your blabbering!
What are you doing?
Are you crazy or what?
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
You should fight better.
"I save lives, I don't take them away."
The first life you have to save is your own.
"And now, we will go get Amelia."
Like jumping into a swimming pool.
Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
Leave that magazine here.
Hello?
"Ah, it's you."
Were you expecting someone more exciting?
Where have you been until this late hour?
The store will be closed tomorrow.
Do you want to meet me in the afternoon?
I've something I need to talk to you about.
It's very important.
"OK, have you bought that stuff I asked you to buy?"
What's that?
That stuff.
"Ah, condoms?"
"Yes, I bought them."
"Hey, what are you going to tell me tomorrow?"
"Oh, my wife is coming."
See you.
Your bath's ready.
Don't you have to get up early for a game of golf with your clients?
Early bed?
Yes.
Have you become one of those old men who read these kind of magazines?
You must be kidding.
One of my colleagues at work loves this kind of stuff and he gave me this one saying it was the best.
"Pornography in Japan is totally tasteless, isn't it?"
She's very pretty.
Doesn't she look just like those girls who work in your department store?
We haven't taken a bath together for so long.
Why don't we do that tonight?
"Are you going to wash me, then?"
That girl in the magazine.
That pretty girl. I've seen her.
"Well, unbusy yourself."
I wanna talk to you.
"Actually, I want to show you something."
I thought we'd gotten past the slightly rapey language.
And...
Bring the flower.
"Oh, uh... we can't be in detention together."
I have a restraining order against these tools.
All of these tools?
"No, just us tools."
Fine.
"You two, over there."
I'm gonna kill him.
"No, you're not."
You're going to find out who's controlling him and then you're gonna help save him.
"You were right, let's kill him."
Kanima.
I was under the impression they were no longer dating.
"Me too, but it looks like they are."
And more.
A lot more.
How do you know it's not some other impressionable young girl...
With severely low standards?
Because I know Scott.
And Allison is the only one that he's ever talked about like that.
I just wanna make sure they continue to be safe.
I couldn't agree more.
What if it's Matt?
"I mean, this whole thing comes back to the video, right?"
Danny said that Matt was the one who found the two hours of footage missing.
Exactly!
He's trying to throw suspicion off himself.
"They both put 100 quid in every month, regularly, no withdrawals."
"Yet last Tuesday at 11:00am, one of the comes into the building society and cleans the whole lot out."
We checked her hours with her boss.
"Last Tuesday, Kelly was at work all day."
She didn't even take a lunch break.
Then it must have been Mr Hartson the loving fiance.
Why clean out the account before they even got married?
They had a row Thursday lunchtime.
You got any idea why Tom wanted to clear out their savings account?
Is that what he did?
Did they row a lot?
A bit.
Lately.
Just put it down to pre-wedding nerves.
You thought there was more to it?
"A week ago, Kelly got home to find the bedding had been changed."
"Sheet, duvet, the lot."
Tom reckoned he'd spilled something over it.
"So Kelly thought he'd had company, yeah?"
Tom had never changed the sheets in his life.
I suggested she bring the sheet in.
For a test?
Yeah.
"She did bring the sheet in the day after, but... as far as I know, she chickened out."
I don't think she wanted to know the truth.
Where is the sheet now?
Did she take it back?
No idea.
It was in her locker.
You got it?
Yeah.
They look like the perfect couple.
Would you stop?
!
Why did you come looking for me?
Sarah...
I was fine.
I came because I wanted to understand why this happened.
"This happened because you and mom, you won't let me live my life."
"You think you can make decisions for me for the rest of my life, forever."
"No, Sarah, that's not true."
I want you to decide.
Right.
Decide to go to art school?
Yes.
"Yeah, so even there, you're taking the thing that I love, and you're..."
"You know I'm an adult, right?"
"And so, that means, for the first time, finally, finally, I can make my own decisions."
You can't control me.
I can do what I want!
"And right now, what I want is to get the hell out of here!"
Tom.
"Just, uh..."
just give me a minute.
Thank you... for taking me back there.
I know it was hard.
"Yeah, you know, I always assumed that it was the problems between marjorie and I that were to blame for what happened with Sarah."
And now?
"Well, now I know it was more complicated than that."
We were scared.
"We thought she was just messing around, you know?"
We thought she just didn't wanna grow up.
"When, in fact, that's exactly what she was trying to do."
"She accused you of wanting to make decisions for her, forever."
For $600?
For your daughter?
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved -- not by you, Tim... or your god."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
I do.
Previously on The Americans
What is it that you do there at the church?
We talk.
They get them when they're children.
They indoctrinate them with friendship and songs.
I really like the people at work.
I don't feel right about helping your office with them anymore.
"Not sure it's enough to get her back on Clark's side, so... this is how I fixed it."
"Oh, come on, guys."
Martha's ugly.
We can expose U.S. Forces secretly training contra commanders on American soil.
It looks like the best way onto the camp is septic.
Which truck do you drive?
- Number nine.
- Where are the keys?
Inside the truck.
We can tie him up and gag him.
- What if he gets loose?
- He won't.
What if a hiker comes by and they call the police when we're in the camp?
Fly low.
Understood.
Transform.
Clear the museum of civilians.
Please evacuate in an orderly passion.
These humans did not respond.
"Well, I don't think we should worry too much about them, partner."
We need to move the planters to create a fire block.
But I...
That would destroy the harmonious nature of the plaza's design.
What?
"Nice of you to show up, Dani!"
Could've been here sooner if my ride wasn't stuck in neutral.
Next time I'm walking.
Looks like a short started the fire.
But this should hold for a while.
Cyber wires are too much for these old circuits.
I have to insist the good thing nobody got hurt.
- I didn't tell it to do that.
- I wouldn't complain.
Your robot was still in rescue mode.
"You gave him the directives to save lives, so it did."
"You're welcome, Graham."
- Where are you going?
- I need some space.
Chief said there is a bunker below street level.
Really I get something called...
the cold war.
"Apparently, we're getting some space too."
Wait for me!
I still don't get it.
How did Cade's robot know that...
I don't want to go home alone.
"All right, Johan, grab your passport."
The party's moving.
"All right, all right, I got our drinks."
And look what else I got.
"Michelle, here, works for Ticketron, and penny is currently suing a major airline."
"You guys should have plenty to talk about, because Neal here has bought tickets for an airplane."
What are you doing?
"I am sending you to ""pound town."""
I don't want to go there.
"Ladies, excuse us."
"Before you say anything,"
I'm comfortable with any combination.
"Look, Mark, I'm not in the mood to hook up with a random stranger."
They're not random.
I hand-picked them.
"Look, when you go through a break up, your body stops producing dopamine, and serotonin."
You know what it does not stop producing?
Sperm.
"Let the pain, and the sperm, out."
"Look, there is no pain, okay?"
"I mean, there should be, but there isn't."
I should be devastated.
"But, I'm not, I'm..."
I'm mostly just relieved.
And it's nothing.
That's not nothing.
Nothing is something.
Feeling nothing is what... it's what being a guy is all about.
Go with that.
Okay.
I feel a little ashamed that I feel relieved.
"Uh, sir?"
"Sir, I'm a part of this, too, now."
"I don't want to be, but I am."
If you don't come forward...
"I don't know, I might have to."
"Well, I guess we're each gonna do what we have to do."
"I can say anything to you, right, dad?"
"Well, this is the last thing you need to know,"
The thing you're never gonna get
To help me deal with.
"This thing that's been living inside me,"
"This cloud that I can't get out from under,"
"It's always been there, but it started to get worse"
During my senior year of high school.
Kim and I went to this party.
It was mostly college kids home for their christmas break.
There was a boy there.
His name was william.
"He was a little older, cute, funny."
"I liked him, so I pretended to be older."
He kept giving me drinks.
"I started to feel funny,"
So he asked me if I needed to lie down.
He helped me upstairs.
And the rest?
"Well, you're defending him now;"
you know what he does.
I was barely awake for any of it.
All I knew the next day
Was that something sick had happened to me.
"When I read about your case in the papers,"
"When I realized how many other girls he'd done it to,"
"Oh, no, no, no, no, no."
Not me.
You.
Island Hoppers is going to sponsor you in the Iron Man.
"Oh, no."
No way.
A person's gotta be crazy to enter that event.
Mm-hmm.
That makes you the perfect candidate.
"Besides, look at the difference in our bodies."
"I mean, I'm all shiny, muscle and power."
But you...
you got the legs to win it.
That's right!
And I intend to keep them.
"I mean, think about this, T.C."
"Swimming, running a marathon and then bicycling a hundred miles."
All right.
"What-What-What about all this """" I owe you one, T.C.""?"
When does that get paid?
"Well, that's different."
"I mean, that's entirely different."
Vouchers.
What about vouchers?
"Vouchers for... for gas, vouchers for air time, vouchers for this, vouchers for that."
When are you gonna take care of that?
"I'd do it, T.C. I really would, but, see, I'm on a case with Barbara here."
Ah.
"Now, I've had occasion during the past 24 hours to scrutinize the body in question."
- Mediocre reflexes...
- Mediocre?
Average motor skills...
The telegram arrived in the morning from Gyula's obituary.
Gyuri got confused totally.
Because it occurred to him that a field postcard came to Tót's address in the today's post.
He remembered well.
Gyula wrote it.
Gyuri did not understand it.
He thought that who can write a postcard may not be dead.
"So, not the telegram valid, but the postcard."
Tót family!
Lajos uncle!
Good news!
A half year was not his so good day!
"Do not bellow, you."
The major lord sleeps yet.
Show me.
- The child.
- Let me see.
Dear my parents and Ágika!
I write this postcard on the railway station.
The train of the major lord before with 5 minutes went away.
"Imagine, the a half year was not so good I day."
"I took a bath and drank beer, the major lord was very kind."
"Please, be cordial to major lord, you make big good one with this for me."
Gyula.
"Ow, let there not be something wrong with him only."
From the cold beer caught cold always.
Do not be scared.
He can look after himself.
Drink.
Well onto..the your kind son's health.
"According to the hygiene that ideal one, if somebody is 8 hours sleeps daily."
"But for who he has to work day and night, in is needed let it have him with 5-10 stole minutes."
You lost him?
!
"Forgive us, sir."
You are hired killers for heaven sakes!
How could you let him get away?
"Yi Soon-shin, that weasel slipped away..."
But there's only one place he could've gone.
Who is it?
Who is it?
What happened?
"My lady, we must quickly move him inside!"
Father...
"I do not know what happened, so I brought him here away from the eyes of the others."
You did the smart thing.
Gatekeeper!
"What brings you here at this late hour, Baron?"
"Forgive me, sir."
I have reasons to believe that a thief that broke into my house tonight is hiding in this house.
You've been misinformed.
No one entered my house tonight.
It's possible that he is hiding here without your knowledge.
"I hate to impose, but please allow me to take a look around."
This will be my last and only request.
Very well.
As you wish.
This is my daughter's room.
Please allow us to take a look.
Even the father is careful about entering a maiden's room.
Don't you know the customs of the nobility?
"But sir, I am acting on a testimony of a witness."
I must assume that the thief is in that room if you tell me to leave.
- Come in.
Why say that he kissed the earth on which I walked?
"Kill me, you needed."
I am so tired.

I am a seagull.
I am a seagull.

"No, it's not true."
"I am an actress, you ..."
"Even he is here, si ..."
"But it does nothing,"
"Did not believe him at the theater, is a mockery of my dreams, and I finished to cease to believe it too."
"I have lost the courage, the torments of love, jealousy ... the constant fear for my child."
"I became a petty, insignificant, read like a slut,"
"I did not know that what to do with my hands, nor as being in the scene."
No longer controlling my voice!
Do not know what means this situation.
It's good for me.
Learn to bring your cross.
It preserves your faith.
I have faith ...
- And the suffering.
- This is ridiculous.
A girl so ...
And when I think of my vocation ...
- It is said: the whores ...
- You should ...
Life does not make me more afraid.
Perhaps to die?
"Here is still alive my last Venini, the untouchable, not the only one who has ever touched me!"

"If you're worried about Neil falling in love with someone the way I fell in love with you, that's like worrying about being struck by lightning."
Hey.
I know what he has.
You don't have to worry.
Okay?
Got everything?
Any sign of technology will throw off our theme.
"Yes, I figured that out when I tried to make a phone call."
Details are important.
"Well, it's where the devil lies... in the details."
"- So, we done here?"
- Not quite.
I believe you owe me a document.
The Bastion contract with my forged signature.
Not just yet.
You do like to play hardball.
"You'll get your contract as soon as the party's over,"
"Bastion is in the clear, and we go our separate ways."
"Oh, are we breaking up?"
"If I'd have known, I would have insisted on being your date tonight."
Break up sex is the best kind.
Not for business partners.
"Is that all I am to you, Neil?"
After all this time?
Yes.
- Honey?
- In here.
You look...
Wow.
"Here, let me help you with that."
I'm a little nervous.
Jeremy should be here any minute.
- I hear they're gonna fry Kesser.
- That's what they do with killers.
- I'll see you around.
"- Come on, let's go."
"When I grow up, I'd love to have a pair of shorts like that."
"- How's your wife, Eddie?"

How would you know...

"Eddie's picking on me again, Uncle Nick."
One of these days it's just going to be you and me!
Workers discovered the nude body wrapped in a sheet.
She was identified as Cheryl Putnam of Monessen.
"Miss Putnam, a stewardess, was abducted from her home,   then taken to another location, where she was murdered."
The brutal crime reminds many of the Polish Hillstranglings.
There's no connection other than the victim being a white female.
"The Polish Hill victims were strangled, not shot at close range."
- You picked the wrong house to rob.
- You got nothing worth stealing.
- It's been a long time.
- I could've killed you.
- I wanted to surprise you.
- You did.
Give me a drink.
Why do you live on a houseboat?
You and your old man should've burned this place down.
- How was California?
- Sunny.
Sunny?
You're out there two years and that's all you can tell me?
"""The Simpsons"" are on an hour earlier."
Are you still mad at me?
What I really wanna do is just play basketball.
Basketball?
"I love it, always have."
I never miss a game on TV-- when my Dad isn't making me rehearse.
I'd love to quit singing and dancing forever and just play ball.
"Dude, you should do that."
You should join the basketball team right now.
- I can't.
"- Yes, you can."
What's stopping you?
It's my Dad.
He thinks basketball is for sissies.
"If I don't do what he wants, he beats me."
"No, dude, listen, you need to take a stand and tell your Dad what you want."
Really?
"When you grow up and you're a fourth grader, you'll understand that you have to be tough and direct with your parents."
Go to your Dad and tell him you wanna give up singing and dancing and join the basketball team.
"You know, you're right."
I'm gonna talk to my old man tonight.
Sweet.
"Sit up properly, Bridon."
You know how strict your father is about posture.
"All right, dear, dinner's ready."
"Okay, let's eat!"
"Dad, I need to talk to you about something."
"Ooh, that sounds emotional!"
# What is it son #
# What's on your mind #
"# Whatever it is, you know your Dad has the time #"
"No, Dad, can we just talk?"
# If you can talk it you can sing it #
# You can lay down the rhythm and bring it #
Let's give it another 15 seconds.
"Doyou want to sit down... together sometime, like with coffee or something?"
Yeah.
"Well, if you everfeel too old to drive, just call that number."
I can't hear you!
- Is she of color?
- And do you love me?
No.
But she's a woman.
Even though I am sometimes irritating?
And a little bit selfish!
"Oh, her."
Even when I forget to ask you how your day was?
"Yeah, okay."
Didn't we already show a local person this year?
I don't think she's ready.
Let's go to slides.
I really do love you-
"All right, what we need to ask ourselves... about each one of these is:"
"Could this have been made in any era, or only now?"
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.
"Okay, what does this tell us about digital culture?"
I don't think this tells us anything about digital culture.
I think you're right.
Let me guess.
This one's about AIDS.
"Yeah, it's not really on the theme, right?"
And we already have photography.
"You know, we have those photos and e-mails."
E-mail wouldn't even exist if it weren't for AIDS.
Fear of contamination.
"Okay, let's just focus on the positive, okay?"
- Mm-hmm.
"- I mean, I just got out of a relationship too, we've never been single at the same time, this could be fun."
"- Ah, I don't know."
"- No, it'll be good."
"You guys can go to clubs, and you can do ""special k,"""
"and, um, you can have sex with European backpackers."
"Okay, I haven't been single in a while."
You know what?
You guys are right.
I've got to get out of this apartment.
Take my mind off of him.
"Yes, yes, see?"
"Good, we'll go out tonight."
Yes.
"I mean, I'm already buzzed and wearing spanx."
I think that's the name of Chelsea handler's new book.
"Hmm, yeah."
Whitney is taped in front of a live studio audience.
"Don't lie, staying with me has been pretty awesome, right?"
"Yeah, this couch is surprisingly comfortable."
"Come on, dude, we both know you're not here for the couch."
You're here because your heart just got its ass kicked.
Right in the balls.
"And of all the people that you know, you came to me."
"Well, I didn't want to impose on Alex and Whitney, and..."
Bup bup bup bup bup.
I'm just happy somebody finally recognized
I'm the emotional go-to guy for our group.
I was actually just about to say that I...
Shh.
"Look, I used to be just like you, okay?"
- Won't pick up.
"Kid's pink, sat's fine."
24 gauge going on in the right.
"You want me to take this, Kerry?"
I don't mind.
"What, you think I'm rusty?"
"Superficial head lacs, no step-offs, left frontal-parietal hematoma."
Call CT and let them know we need a head.
Finally calming down.
Or going apnic.
"Come on, baby."
Wake up.
Wake up.
"All right, uh, Inez, miller one and a 4-O."
She needs a tube.
"Kerry, the kid's screaming."
The airway is obviously fine.
She's got a good mechanism for a head injury and she needs a CT.
"So what you're going to subject her to the risks of intubation, just to make it easier for the radiologist?"
- She'll settle down.
Give her some time.
- She doesn't have time.
Agitation could be an early sign of head injury.
Or an appropriate response to a stressful situation.
Babies cry when they're scared.
"Thank you, but this is my patient."
Her mental status is waxing and waning.
She could go apnic in the scanner.
You bag her through it.

Hold on.
You're going to lose your neuro exam if you sedate.
Not the kind of makeup that women use in the street.
Pancake.
Women very often use a brand of makeup that's made up for actors like pancake.
"I, for example, use precisely that product myself."
"Yes, sir."
I know.
Yes.
I'm sure you do by now.
"No, but the point here is something else, sir."
"You see, the lab found traces of four different shades of makeup on that mask."
"And women, you know, they don't usually change shades that much."
"So, in the light of that, sir, I got to thinking."
Where did it lead you to this time?
"A guess, sir."
A professional makeup man?
"Right, sir."
And then to my makeup table.
"Oh, no, sir."
"No, sir."
No.
I only came here to see you.
Honest.
I was just fooling around with the shoes just to pass the time for something to do until you came in.
No.
I didn't look at another thing while I was here.
That means you didn't have to.
You already know something.
Where did you look?
"Guess, sir."
I'll give you three guesses.
The studio wardrobe department.
"You got it in one, sir."
"You can just tell him I was nuts, you know."
Stir-crazy.
Me?
I like a kid with some... with some get-up-and-go to him!
"I like a kid that knows all the answers, all the angles."
"Why, I like a kid that..."
H- how do you get out of here?
"Good luck, Joe."
"Hello, Joe."
I saw you delivering your boy.
Aren't you staying to take him over now?
"You're running out on him, eh?"
Getting big-hearted.
"That touches me, Joe."
I'm going to help you.
Start walking into the alley.
"Well, you've had a nice, long time to think about it, and now it's here, Joe."
Move on.
Now just stand there a minute and I'll give you something else to think about.
"So you're kind of bashful about letting people know he's your boy, are you?"
"Well, I'll do it for you, Joe."
"After I pump you full of this,"
I'm going to drop a little note to every newspaper in town.
Going to tell them about your boy.
Going to tell them what you don't seem so proud of anymore.
That he's Joe Krozac's son.
"All his little pals are going to know it from now on, Joe."
"No, you won't."
"Stay there, Joe, I haven't finished."
"They'll all know it, Joe, everybody."
"Joe Krozac, jr.!"
Joe Krozac... subtitles resynched and adapted by cinephage from the TCM cc

- but you didn't name me.
"- i know, but i still like brandie."
and i love you like you're one of my own.
"'cause family is very important, okay?"
family is all we really got.
"and, harley, my angel."
you know i've always loved you the most.
i'm just kidding.
i love all you guys.
but i love you.
and this is for you.
"- thank you, mama."
- you're welcome.
"- * noel, noel"
- it's just a little something.
"- i love it, mama."
"- oh, don't go bs'ing me, boy."
"it's, uh -- it's supposed to be like when you -- [sighs] when you don't have something, but it's like -- it's like it means something, but it's... help me."
you know what i'm saying?
- a symbol?
- yes!
a symbol!
dang!
wayne must have been teaching you while i was out doing... doing my thing.
"so, that is supposed to remind you of where you've come from, but not where you're going, okay?"
and that's probably me in there with my feet up on the recliner after a hard day at girl curl -- just lazy.
How's your arm?
"(DISTORTED) You think, because you tasted my blood, that you know what I am."
"Well, to be fair, I am standing in your flat."
You don't know what I am.
- And you don't know where I am.
- Where are you?
Everywhere!
I can walk down any street.
I can peer...
"- He's close, less than a mile."
- I can knock on any door.
I am the shape at the window.
I am the hand under the bed.
"So what's the play, Cameron?"
"Cos that's what it is, isn't it?"
It's a play.
With Cameron Pell starring as Mr Punch.
Do you know anything about this city?
"Well, I know that it smells a bit funny when it gets hot."
"This, now, everything, this place, this time, this cretinised culture."
"- We are the richest, most decadent..."
- Less than three minutes.
...people that ever lived.
And still we're dissatisfied.
We have lost our history.
We have lost our myths.

Where were you?
The dining room's over there.
Hello?
Hello?
- What's wrong?
Can't you say a word?
- Sure.
Hello.
- Where are we going?
- Anyplace out of town where we can eat.
- Not to speak of why.
- You're an inquisitive gal.
"There's a place at Flamingo Beach, but it's f ar. I have to be back at 3."
Stand him up.
You're with me until after dark.
"- lt isn't a man, it's my hairdresser."
- That makes it rugged.
- My hair's a mess after last night.
- Then let it down.
Maybe I'll let mine down too.
I can't understand why Martinelli spiked our drinks.
- He thinks you're with that gangster?
- He knows I'm not one of the mob just a guy who sat in on a stud game once in a while.
"- Well, then I don't see why--"
- Women ask too many questions.
- They should just be beautif ul.
- And let the men do the worrying.
"Women ought to come capsule-size, about f our inches high."
"When a man goes out, he puts her in his pocket."
"That way, he knows where she is."
"He gets to his restaurant, he puts her on the table then swaps a few lies with his pals without danger of interruption."
When it comes that time in the evening when he wants her f ull-sized he just waves his hand and there she is.
I got rights.
- I could do something about this shit.
"- Boy, please."
"The only rights that are important are a woman's right to choose, and I choose a life without you."
"Come on, Amber, that's cold, now."
- You wanna know what's cold?
- What?
- The truth.
"- Well, what's the truth?"
( scoffs ) Truth is you old as dirt for a wide receiver.
"I mean, maybe you have a couple of seasons left at best, but after that, who are you, hmm?"
"Just some lonely-ass, busted ex-football player with a couple of bucks."
"- Well, you wanna know the truth I see?"
- Yeah.
"Yeah, what truth you see?"
Tell me.
Hmm?
- I ain't even gonna say it.
"- Yeah, 'cause you're chicken shit."
"Look, 'cause I'm a gentleman, that's why."
'Cause you have nothing on me other than I was stupid enough to sleep with your sorry ass.
"You really going for it today, huh?"
Well done.
"I'm just keeping it real, Rick, just like you taught me."
"So, if you don't mind, I have some packing to do."
"Oh, you know what?"
Can you put this on the truck for me on your way out?
Thank you.
Uh...
"Hey, I'm gonna have the tuna tartare, and can you have 'em throw a fried egg on it?"

MONTENEGRO:
"Not enough to escape, but enough to give him some range of movement."
"If he pushed himself back onto the table, he could raise his upper torso, which made it possible for him to generate a whiplike motion."
And sever his spinal cord.

The man was once a priest.
And suicide is a cardinal sin.
It wasn't a suicide.

"Look, so, um, sorry that I haven't been exactly present."
JESSICA:
"Oh, well, we've all been working hard."
"I haven't been that available, either. (chuckles)"
"No, I'm talking mentally present."
I've been distracted.
"Oh, yeah, it's-- it's about your father."
"No, I-I understand."
You must be worried about what happens when they find him.
I am.
It's not as cut and dry as I thought it was gonna be.
"Well, I'm glad you're seeing that now."
"(exhales forcefully) Look, there's something else that I've been thinking about."
I want you to know that...
He never told me that.
You see?
"You never know, do you?"
"On the other hand,"
Ward Fowler has an alibi.
He was with Mark during the whole time during the murder.
And that alibi is ain'tight.
Is it as ain'tight as Sid Daley's?
"Oh, I think it's more, sir."
"I mean, a girl that you're gonna marry is much more apt to provide an alibi than a gofer."
What do we conclude from this interrogation?
"Ward Fowler denies having a motive, he won't admit to having means,"
and he can prove that he didn't have opportunity.
So that leaves us with Sid Daley.
"That's a great third act line, isn't it?"
"""That leaves us with Sid Daley."""
"Well, I think this has been very helpful, sir."
Thank you very much.
I certainly appreciate it.
Oh.
"One more thing, sir."
We got something else on the gun.
Did I mention that?
"No, you."
Didn't.
"What, Lieutenant?"
A thread sir.
From the parka?
"No, sir."
"We haven't traced the garment from which the thread came from yet, sir."
"Lieutenant, if I were you, I'd get a search warrant for all four people involved."
"Yes, sir."

It belongs to the world of humans.
"In other words, it's yours."
I do not want!
"Well, well."
"Still, you should not forward saying relative and all."
You should show the hierarchy respect.
"Whatever is the idea you get, say first to me."
I will forward that after filtering.
It is a risk to you once we take a reverse.
"Even if it is a risk, I should get all the credit."

'Cause you want to see me fail.

Get supplies for Judah-Fest.
"Yeah, I can do that, with money for both provisions and my services as a nanny/assistant."
Oh.

"Now, your mother will want some of her things."
Ah...a pretty dress to wear.
They're only looking for me.
You don't have to get any more involved than you already are.
"Why, if my precious girl is involved then I'm involved, too."
Do you remember this?
She always used to wear it on special occasions.
You did.
"Bullshit, you could have come to me privately."

"Alex is right, you gave him no choice."
"God damn it, Harvey, that prison is doing shady shit."

You're gonna have to be a little more specific.

The Gagnon Nursery is full of Kings just like it.
Kings just like it?
She loved dogs...
especially coIIies.
They were all named King.
"When the Iast one died in the spring, she didn't replace him."
"She said, she could go anytime, and the family would have enough to care for polo never mind a dog."
So she bought a little plaster negro.
"Her "" little King""."
Poor old lady.
She was totally lost.
She kept asking:
"What do we do, Bertrand?"
We can't call the cops just for that.
I Iooked at him:
"maybe not call the cops... but still, you can't smash everything you find ugly."
"while we were wondering,"
polo decided to taste the nigger.
He does that with strangers.
"He goes up to them, he smells them, and sometimes even licks them."
And how did the kid react?
Of course we all feel weird the first time.
He was no different.
He started smiling.
It was the only time we saw him smile.
She went to get him and said:
"Forgive him, he means no wrong."
It always upset her when it happened.
She would always say the same thing:
"polo, come on, we don't do that."
"You can look at them, you can smell them."
We won't fit the description so easily.
No problem.
Ain't that some shit.
"You going to be able to make it a whole day without me, baby?"

I can't believe she got mixed up in shit like this.
"Hurricane, I'm still unclear how you know this Lila Walker."
"Well, sir, I arrested her for shoplifting once."
She was just a kid in high school.
All she took was some lipstick and...
You know that shit they put on their eyes.
Wasn't worth 10 bucks.
I could tell right off she wasn't bad.
Just sort of high-spirited.
So I decided to try to help her out.
"You know, talk to her."
Then one day she just up and disappeared.
"Somebody said she'd decided to take off for Hollywood, become a movie star."
"Anyway, that was about, oh, five years ago."
That's the last I heard of her till now.
She's come a long way from ripping off lipstick.
I don't believe she killed anybody.
"I mean, that kid in the closet, she opens the door, sees him, then closes the damn door."
That proves she's not a killer.
"Pardon me, Hurricane, but that don't prove shit."
DUD:
I don't think we get to see him enough.
There's a Iot of things said about the mom's spirit and feeling towards it.

"Oh, dear me, how very Victorian of you."
What's wrong with Victorian values?
Are you sure?
I have always been sure!
Good.
"I'm glad you think so, since your entire adult life is about to be erased."
"No parasite without a host, without you, it will have no voice, without the governess, it will have no form."
What...
"What's happening, what's happening, what did you do?"
You've got nothing left to mirror any more.
Goodbye.
What did you...
Did you...
Did you...
Did you really think it would be so easy?
That's not possible.
How is that possible?
Doctor!
They're growing!
The snowmen are growing!
What do we do?
But you were just Dr Simeon.
"You're not real, he dreamed you, how can you still exist?"
Now the dream outlives the dreamer and can never die.
Once I was the puppet.
Now I pull the strings!
I have tried so long to take on human form.
I know.
It seems like it just expanded.
You are not trying to get these back in here.
- You are not getting rid of these pants.
"- We had a deal, mister."
These are not staying.
- You can store those horizontally.
- Goodwill wouldn't even take these.
"They could be pressed, flattened, you can..."
"If you're gonna throw them out, at least check the pockets, all right?"
So you don't throw away some personal items.
I love you so much.
So much.
And I wanna make you happy.
I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy.
Will you marry me?
"Yes, of course I will."
Yes.
Yes.
NEIL:
Thank God.
GIGI:
Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up:
"If a guy punches you, he likes you."
Never try to trim your own bangs.
And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending.
- and your commitment to each other.
GIGI:
"Every movie we see, every story we're told  implores us to wait for it."
The third act twist:
The unexpected declaration of love.
The exception to the rule.
APPLAUSE
You know what?
"You know what, though?"
"If you want to have teeth like Rob's, that's how hard you gotta work out."
You know Nigeria turned him down to be part of their Olympics in 2008?
"I love the idea of him going back having, like, his Pretty Woman moment and going,"
"""You guys work on commission?"
Big mistake.
"HUGE mistake."""
"Jessica, have you ever watched a fight?"
"I did watch the fight, yeah..."
What did you do?
..in the most conventional way.
I was in the Walkabout in Newquay on a hen do.
"I've never really watched it before, but I got quite into it."
"I was quite scared and horny, if I'm honest."
It's something very primal going on.
"Rob, you were..."
You made this documentary about the fight.
Or just pre the fight.
And you got to spar with a former middleweight champion.
Oh...
If only there were a clip of that(!
)
So...
"Can I just say, he's an ex-world champion, and I'm not!"
I don't think you needed to say that.
"When you watch it, just remember Rob is not a professional boxer."
Have a little look.
Aw...
Hands up!
You need waking up!
"I should have died, but you..."
"You didn't want to be alone, and that's what all this boils down to."
You can't stand the thought of being alone.
All right.
I'll give you this much.
You are certainly willing to do the sacrificing as long as you're not the one being hurt.
"All right, you want to be honest?"
"If the situation were reversed and I was dying, you'd do the same thing."
"No, Dean."
I wouldn't.
Same circumstances...
I wouldn't.
I'm gonna get to bed.
"== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man"
Previously on-- Power Rangers...
And now...
A new era is about to begin.
It's a shame you will not be here to see it coming.
"Knight power, energize! [pink] Robo Knight!"
You cannot stop our invasion of Earth from happening.
Fire! Your highness...
It has been an honor to serve you.
What?
"If I were you, I would go into hiding."
The armada will be here any minute.
"Your brother, the prince, won't recognize you, and may mistake you for an enemy."
"Even though I couldn't do it myself,"
I take comfort knowing that you will be destroyed soon.
Watch out! Argus.
Levira.
Our invasion went well.
Not really.
I'm sort of all right as I am.
"Please, Will."
"What does that mean? ""Please"" what?"
Look at yourself.
You're 38 and you've never had a job or a relationship that lasted longer than two months.
I wouldn't exactly say you were okay.
"I mean, I would say you were a disaster."
"I mean, what is the point of your life?"
Bloody hell.
You're right.
There's probably no point to my life but thank you for bringing it up.
The reason we wanted you to come here today was we wanted to ask you how would you like to be Imogene's godfather?
Seriously?
Seriously.
"Listen, I'm really, really touched."
But you must be joking.
I couldn't possibly think of a worse godfather for Imogene.
You know me.
I'll drop her at her christening.
"I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her."
"I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice."
"We know, I just thought you had hidden depths."
No.
No.
You've always had that wrong.
I really am this shallow.
Here we are.
"You know you don't have to walk me to school anymore now, Mum."
I know the way now.
But what if I like walking you to school?
Right.
And I'm actually the oldest.
It's pretty safe to say that Jill's obsession with aging and getting married in due time started back in Catholic school and specifically our first communion.
We got to walk down the isle like mini brides to be.
Comparing prettiest dresses...
and fanciest bows.
This is where Jill got programmed to plan for the next time... she would walk down the aisle...
dressed in white.
You are getting married
A little toy here or there never hurt anyone.
Plus it comes with a carrying case.
Oh!
That is such an inappropriate gift.
What you're saying you don't masturbate?
No personally I don't masturbate.
I find it to be a little bit... un-holy.
Wouldn't you agree?
Jillian thank you I love this!
Dale have you talked to JP?
No.
I mean he called twice but...
"Hey, I heard you saw Zach."
Oh yeah.
I saw his video on TV the other day he looks so good.
Did you guys make plans to hang out?
No we just caught up for a second.
He was with a girlfriend.
Hmmm...
Ok what is up?
What?
You look like either have to pee or you're about to explode with gossip.
Do I?
- Which is it?
He appeared before me first time I presided over the moot court at Yale.
You could say Peter and I are joined at the hip.
"Thanks, Peter."
Please have a seat.
"Thank you for seeing me, Judge Stern."
And how can I help you?
Tino Zapatti.
What about him?
How did he get off with probation?
I can only sentence in accordance with the conviction.
He was convicted of criminal possession of the fourth degree.
They found a kilo in his car.
Is it your intention to try the case again?
Not at all.
But I read the rap sheet.
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge and you're sitting here rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, Captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry...
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
"Please, you know this is the last thing I wanted to do."
Then get the hell out of Internal Affairs and get yourself an honest job.
"Andres did not agree, but I insisted."
I had to know.
what madness!
"In any case, it has helped, I am now covinced it was not his imagination, he was telling the truth."
It seems his madness is contagious.
"We will soon know if its truly madness, Ricardo."
Tomorrow we will dive again.
I do not want to have a single doubt.
I will go along.
What your are doing makes no sense.
Go on holiday and forget about all this.
You would like to see me in an insane asylum.
I am not insane.
"And if you have come for that, you could have spared yourself the trip."
You are wasting our time.
Is it that you don't realize that you're risking angelica's life?
So...
That's what it is?
I hope nothing happens to her.
I doubt you will overcome this madness anytime soon.
Can you tell me why you tossed the tank and the harpoon?
"Protection, in case..."
In case of necessity.
I understand.
Andres...
"God Dammit, I don't like this."
"Here, take this."
"What is it that you are doing, Andres?"
I have to help Angelica.
Don't move.
"And you, drop that gun."
"Once again we meet,eh."
-Like what?
Speaking in a language she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
"Look, your daughter doesn't say she's a demon."
She says she's the devil himself.
If you've seen as many psychotics as I have you'd realize that's the same thing as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte.
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.
I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind.
Tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good.
You tell me that!
Did Regan know a priest was coming over?
-No.
-Did you know my mother died recently?
"-Yes, I did."
I'm very sorry.
-No.
Is Regan aware of it?
Not at all.
Why do you ask?
It's not important.
Good night.
Hello?
"- Here, take it and just don't...."
"No cell members, no lab, no dispersal devices."
We're still looking for escape tunnels.
Call us.
We're running out of time.
The attack's supposed to take place in less than 24 hours.
So getting Jind Allah to talk is our only chance of finding them.
- Time I confronted him with the truth.
- What are you going to do?
Show him my hand.
I'm going to give you the respect of telling you what just happened.
A team of agents raided an omega cell location.
"Actually, both of them."
Our men are in place in Annandale as we speak.
You gain nothing by remaining silent.
Jihad is forever.
Something's wrong.
His hands.
"Gideon, something's wrong."
This guy seemed relieved by what you just told him.
Excuse me.
- What's the problem?
- Get everybody out of there.
- Now!
Now!
Now!
- Everybody out.
It's a trap.
Now!
I said out!
Go!
How did a terror cell get its hands on anthrax without a single lab reporting a security breach?
Would we know if a foreign lab had a breach?
I'm not sure.
Some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule extracted from the urine of cows.
I like cows.
That's not the point.
It was its own point.
Go on.
I'm a scientist.
My ability to think is my bread and butter.
"I'm afraid if I take this, I might lose that special, unique something that makes me so successful in my field."
"Rajesh, I've had the privilege of working alongside you for many years."
My recommendation is that you gobble these up like Tic Tacs.
"Okay, I'm still trying to work this out."
How did Penny meet an astronaut?
I don't know.
The regular way people meet astronauts.
Most of those guys live in Texas.
"Obviously, this one doesn't."
Okay.
Leonard lives here.
Priya's from India.
"People meet, Howard."
God!
Fine.
"You've met lots of astronauts, and I've never grilled you about that."
I'd thank you to extend me the same courtesy.
I'm not grilling you;
I was just curious.
I still can't get over the fact that she got a big movie part.
"Not that I care what my ex-girlfriend's up to, 'cause I don't."
"Maybe that's where she met the astronaut, all right?"
I'm sorry.
What would an astronaut be doing working on a movie?
We heard that you would spare our lives if we surrendered.
Please take us in.
I heard that you are Manwol pirates.
Is that true?
Yes.
Do you know the whereabouts of Yum Moon?
"I saw him in Yongeum, but I haven't seen him since."
How can we trust you?
"It's the head of Yong-su, the leader of the Manwol pirates."
"He refused our plea to surrender, and tried to go under the command of Head Chief Yum Moon."
It is a head.
We will take you in.
But you will not be freed until the remaining pirates are wiped out.
- Do you accept those terms?
"- Yes, sir."
We will attack Chunghae now.
We must kill Jang Bogo and his security officers to avenge the master's death.
Go to battle!
To battle!
ANGELS IN FAST MOTION
I'm a pusher frau from Jutland.
I'm having my period.
"It gives me a stomach-ache, and I feel nauseous."
I've got 1800 grams of hashish taped to my body   and then this happens...!
Asger had said there'd be no police.
He promised me there'd be no police.
It never went wrong before.
First I take the train to Copenhagen and then on to Christiania to get the stuff from our dealer.
- How are things in Jutland?
- Okay.
And here?
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course at my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"- Spider, right?"
- Not the nickname I heard.
We're done.
"I'm gonna go and stay with my sister, now."
"I assume we never meet again, which is a tragedy I'll just have to live with."
Here are the keys to the flat.
- We're not finished yet.
"- We had an agreement, Lenny."
I think you overestimated your ability to insist on deal breakers.
- You gave me an undertaking.
- To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"- Send me back to prison, then, please."
- We can do that.
- Then do it.
"- Only this time, it's for life."
I'll make sure of it.
- You were never gonna set me free.
"- Don't be so ungrateful, John."
I've even authorised your mobile to make outgoing calls.
"This is freedom, isn't it?"
"Oh, mate."
You're not gonna believe this.
I've cracked it with one of them Colombian chicks.
Big beautiful brown eyes.
"Mate, I have got a strong feeling that before long, Manuela - that's her name - she's gonna be down here dancing on the end of my bed."
Chill out.
Hospitals simply are going insane.
We've already reached the limit.
Maybe you should give up.
"A comatose patient is also a person, right?"
There are people who have woken up after 17 years!
What if my father wakes up?
"Just because of money, you decided to give up on my father?"
I already said I would pay the money.
Please carry out the stent surgery.
Hurry.
Please save my father.
Go ahead with the surgery.
Everything is settled.
I've already paid for the surgery.
"Here, your hand phone."
Wait a moment!
You... why did you help me?
I didn't help you.
I just don't want to hear that someone died because of me.
Thank you very much.
I'll pay you back the money.
Please give me your bank account number.
There's no need.
That money is only chewing gum money to me.
I'll just think of it as a donation to the poor.
It's just a small donation I gave you.
I...
"Seriously, I mean you can't compare the absence of a father with chewing gum!"
"And you can't classify us as ""poor people""."
I still owe you a debt.
Thank you!
I will surely pay you back.
"Well, you're right."
I'm invisible.
"That night, the only person in worse shape than Robin... was her fiancé."
"Ted, I'm desperate."
"Earlier today, I saw that wrist cuff, and I got a partial for Marshall."
Did you bang that girl yet?
Don't get your hopes or anything else up.
I tried to connect with her... but everything just comes back to her weird fetish about how old I am.
"Well, just go simple."
Does she like TV?
No.
But I'll watch 60 Minutes with you as loud and as long as you want.
- Sports?
- No.
But I bet you look super hot playing shuffleboard... just slathered in Bengay.
"- Well, does she like books?"
- No.
- But I bet you do.
- Mm-hmm.
I bet you have a big...
thick... pair of bifocals.
She doesn't have daddy issues.
She has granddaddy issues.
I'm ending it.
"Ted, I beg of you."
Don't quit on a body that won't quit.
"Ooh, ooh, that'll go sweet on a bumper sticker."
That's going in the journal.
- Did you steal my dream journal?
- No!
Now get back in there before all your teeth fall out... and you're naked in front of Shaker Heights High School in a play you never rehearsed for.
Bastard!
- We're to be going.
Heaven knows when we shall be back.
Why do you suppose he turned up in an Arab outfit and wearing make-up?
What's more important:
why was he killed?
I bet he was a spy or something.
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?
I'll tell you later.
- (Siren Wailing)
- What is it?
l-l just feel kinda funny.
Why should he pick me out to tell?
After what we said about him last night.
"When we get in with the inspector, I'll do my best to cut the red tape."
- Fine.
Fine.
- l'm going to stretch a bit.
I'm afraid the questions will go till doomsday if you admit you knew him.
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.
"They're a cynical lot, these French."
They might refuse to believe that.
"Well, they've got to believe it."
Look at it from their point of view.
"They saw this poor fellow whispering to you, and then they saw you write something down."
Are you gonna show them what you wrote?
(Phone Ringing)
(Speaking French)
"Thank you, Mr Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary."
"Won't you come inside, madame, monsieur?"
Do me the kindness to wait.
I should have benched Grimes on the bin-Khalid raid.
"Rebecca, he was messed up before the mission, okay?"
He started talking crazy about this conspiracy and that conspiracy - I just...
"I should have reported it, brought it to you, but I covered for him, I just..."
I tried to get his head straight.
We all missed it.
"Now my men are dead, because of Grimes."
"And now he has the list, and, uh... if any more people get killed..."
You can't put this on yourself.
Are you going to help me or not?
"Even if I do, how do you expect to get into the station?"
In the back of a patrol car.
You're gonna let them arrest you?
"Look, I'm a black man standing on the corner at 3rd and Decatur."
"Trust me, it won't be that hard."
"Just be ready to take care of the security cameras, okay?"
I'll call you when I'm inside.
Carter?
Drop the bag.
Where the hell you going?
- Just walking.
- Yeah?
How about you walk over there and put your hands on the wall?
"Whoa, whoa, Paul, Paul, come on, easy."
Pat him down.
"Hey, come on, you're gonna break his arm."
I said pat him down.
"Whoa, oh, oh, oh, easy, all right?"
"His gun, get it and kick it over here."
- Hurry up.
- All right.
All right.
They're like d--dustbin lorries.
He goes round picking up every bit of rubbish he can lay his lobes on!
They're a lot nicer ears than many I've had to see to.
"Now, listen."
"As the person you're supposed to be engaged to,"
I don't much like this comparison of some of the things you've had to see to!
And I can well understand why!
"""And I can well understand why."""
"Granville, now listen."
Stand there.
"The minute Nurse Gladys Emanuel goes into her house, you're out again on the street."
"Oh, dear."
"Look, she's been caught by Mrs Pendlebury."
"Oh, dear!"
"She's a very peculiar sh--shape, is Mrs Pendlebury."
Can't be very convenient for Mr Pendlebury.
He often comes in here quite late of an evening for his six--pack of ale with a desperate look in his eye.
"She'll be there for half an hour, you mark my words."
"Ah, good."
A reprieve!
At last I've had a reprieve.
-
"- Not for long, Granville."
-
"- Oh, 'eck!"
Do I have to go out there?
They'll only laugh at me.
I know they'll only laugh.
"Come on, chin up!"
"You come from proud stock, lad."
"Waterloo, the B--Battle of Britain, the Glorious Double Gloucesters!"
"We are a stubborn race, when the chips are down."
"Left or right, Sir?"
Left.
"Your left or my left, Sir?"
"But sir I came thought here, there are two doors... shall I go through here or there?"
Where is he?
"Brother, Buy a underwear."
I don't want it.
"Buy a underwear, It's awesome."
"I said, I don't want it."
"Buy it, once you wear it you'll become superman."
"Wear it and fly, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and fight, it won't rip off."
"Wear it and climb Kutub Minar, it won't rip off."
Jump off the Kutub Minar your everything will be ripped off but the underwear will stay the same.
This is the guarantee of Laxminarayan.
But your voice will rip my brain off for sure.
Should I write it down?
I already have one.
You have one!
Then you should wear it.
How do you know that I'm not wearing underwear?
You know about my nature.
And this is Laxminarayan Three.
I can tell the topic of letter by looking at the envelope.
I can tell the size of the son by looking at the father.
Wow.
He's been selling undergarments since he didn't even wear undergarment.
He's made a undergarments factory.
Bulbul loungewear.
What is this?
Who are these slim girls?
"Dad, they are our brand models."
When Ronny went to jail?
"Before that, when we were out on his boat."
In the storm?
That was fun?
That sucked.
"No, it didn't."
You thought it was exciting.
I wasn't excited.
I was hysterical.
There's a huge difference between hysteria and excitement.
Are we ever gonna have a relationship?
We're having a relationship.
"Here we are, having it."
Ian's got a room at the Chateau.
We'll stay there...
-...you can have the place to yourself.
-You should stay.
"Alex is still looking for an apartment, and we need something permanent so just stay."
Why don't you ask her?
Maybe she wants to be alone in the interim.
I'm sure Alex wants you to stay.
"I mean, she can't stay away from you as it is."
He's gonna give her a frontal lobe.
"No, no, he'll just give her Thorazine and then lock her up."
I think she wants to be locked up.
"Yeah, exactly."
Make your analysis at first  with three general patterns of emotional response.
Rage is the response to the primary stimulus of thwarting.
-Should I be embarrassed for us?
-I am.
I really am.
You gonna have another?
I don't really have an appetite right now.
I met some people there.
At Ojai.
Like Sarah.
"Mom, do you remember that Christmas, when I was eight and I had my tonsils taken out?"
"And then after the surgery, your friend Bill came by to visit."
And he gave me that doll with the long red hair.
Did Bill really think that a doll could make up for abandoning me?
"What was it, a ""sorry for being a deadbeat dad"" gift?"
No.
Please.
Let me explain.
There's an explanation for why you lied to me for 20 years?
You said that Bill was your friend and left out the part about him being your boyfriend for two decades and my father!
Honey.
"Oh, God."
It is complicated.
"It seems pretty simple to me, Mom."
You were willing to be sloppy seconds for some rich jerk with a wife and kids.
My dad didn't want to fess up to a bastard child with his mistress because he didn't want to risk his Norman Rockwell life.
No.
"I know that you're angry, but you need to hear me through."
Why?
It's too late to do anything about it.
He's dead!
"- Yes, but... but you..."
- How much of it is mine?
What?
The money that William Walker left you.
How much of it is mine?
I put two million dollars in a trust in your name.
And it will be yours when you're 25.
He never mentioned trouble at work.
- You think there could be a connection?
- Could be.
"You hear ""A.T.F. investigation,"" it raises flags."
"Well, I wish I could be more helpful."
Sorry.
You should just focus on getting your son back.It's the best way to deal with it.
"Evelyn, I think you're stronger than you realize."
Then maybe I should have just stuck with it.
"You know, what would have happened if- if I had have pretended that everything was all right?"
"But I didn't want my family to be a lie- not forJasper, not for me."
You're doing the best thing.
Believe me.
I know a little something about this.
"I've stayed, and I've left, and sometimes leaving is what you have to do."
"Must be lonely, what you do."
- I couldn't live that way.
- In my line of work...
I can't allow myself to get too close.
What if you met someone?
There's a spark.
Would you ignore it?
Could you?
"I would, uh... concentrate on getting the job done."
I gotta head over to Doug's.
I'll call you as soon as I know anything.
Okay.
"What's taking so long, Sam?"
You losing your touch?
I didn't know Doug would have a nine-pin dimple lock.
"You know, the new kind- the kind I haven't practiced on."
"Okay, my fingers are bleeding now."
and contusion on the arm.
"Look, this is an arm... the contusion, commonly called a bruise, is this big."
"So, in my opinion, she suffered a violent blow."
"Maybe she fell, I don't know."
Is it possible that she got into a fight?
She didn't say?
No she didn't talk about that.
"Mind you, she told me that... at some point she got up, she went to the window... and that's when she saw... the lady in question, on the ground."
"She would have also seen a young black man running, running..."
Did she say anything else?
I'm trying to see...
It's not my field...
"No, that's about it."
"Then, another blackout."
Any idea as to when we could interrogate her?
Not before 3 days.
3 days?
"3 full days, if not more."
Maybe you can get ahead with your investigation.
There might be other leads...
"Yes, thank you."
We'II follow other leads.
"- Thank you, doctor."
- alright.
"unfortunately, I must go to the clinic, but if you need me for anything..."
- Don't hesitate.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
"well, we'II take care of you guys."
alright... where do we do this?
"We could go in there, there are doors."
We'II get back to you shortly.
- He wouldn't have been pleased.
- Of course not.
He didn't like revolutions.
"Still, he was like a brother to me."
"We always liked the same women, but never the same politicians."
At least you don't take after anyone in your family.
That was excellent.
My compliments!
The worst is over.
"One more day, and who knows what would have happened."
I think you'll be able to get up again in a week's time.
"Give him some more morphine in an hour, but be careful with the dose."
Wait a minute.
Can't I do that myself?
Don't be silly.
I've been working in hospitals for 20 years.
I've seen worse things.
"Thanks, Pablito."
I don't believe it!
You should know you can't smoke in a hospital.
I'll go and relieve Getullio now.
I don't think there'll be any trouble here for a while.
You deserve a drink.
"Don't worry, it's not Communion wine."
Cheers.
"It's strong, isn't it?"
The Campesinos distil it illegally.
- Aren't priests banned from drinking this?
"- Yes, but some do worse things."
- When will this insanity be over?
- When we've succeeded.
"I'm really not opposed to your revolution, Mariá, but what makes me sad is that you use the same violence as them."
Wise guy!
"- Hey, wait!"
- You talkin' to me?
Hold on a minute.
What's your big hurry?
- What do you want?
- Nuthin'.
Just got a question.
"Now, then... where are you going?"
To work.
Work's hard to find these days.
I know some work for a guy with your muscles.
I don't use muscle anymore.
I use... my kisser!
"Step right up, ladies and gentlemen."
Come closer.
Why do rich men on the west side wear ties but workers don't?
"Step right up, folks."
"You too, young lady with your husband, and you minors too."
Why don't workers wear ties?
Because they can't tie 'em!
"So he buys a tie holder but it's poor quality, and he can't tie his tie!"
That's cheating the customer!
That's a swindle!
That makes people resentful and pushes Germany even deeper into misery than it already is!
"Come closer, folks."
You storm troopers are kindly invited to join the festivities too.
Step in closer so I can save my voice.
I didn't insure it.
I couldn't make the first payment.
Buy my handy little ready-made gadget here.
You'll save time and money.
- Right.
- Grant would have slapped your face.
- He did once.
"Listen, it's fine that this is funny and, Mr. Vice President, I couldn't care less."
- But what about the campaign?
- What about it?
- President just got past an honesty issue.
- He's not past it.
- If it becomes public...
- That's a big assumption.
"No, it's not."
I think that issue is probably worth further discussion but we're done talking about the ticket.
The president wants the vice president to remain the vice president and he wrote down his one and only reason.
"""Because I could die."""
"Well, of course, he's right, sir."
It doesn't solve the problem of the electoral math.
I don't know what the field will look like after Labor Day.
"It'll be shaken up, but right now the math's tough."
"And I know you all think he's a punch line, and I know why."
But I disagree.
They're sure running the right guy against us.
Am I the only one who thinks a giant sumo wrestler and a hockey goal might get the job done?
I don't know.
I'm open to new ideas.
-Oh!
"Hey, Rach!"
-Hi.
-Happy Valentine's Day!
-You too!
How's living at Ross'?
"It's good, except he makes us watch the Discovery Channel all day long."
Stay here!
I'll be right back.
Are you not feeling well?
- I'm just waiting for someone.
Thanks a lot.
- Excuse me please...
Did you get her rid of her so soon?
Who am I supposed to have gotten rid of?
I've been sleeping here!
This caring is touching!
Did you not see Hassenreuter's costumes down below?
"I figured that I'd stay guard here, so that nothing is stolen."
And then you open up a chest without any authorization and take its contents out?
Should I sleep on the mattress?
"No, Bruno, that you shouldn't do!"
You need a soft pillow for your conscience to let you sleep.
Do you also sleep in your nightdress?
You piece of crap!
"If it weren't for your sister,"
I'd break every bone in your body!
You're not worthy of her blind adoration...
Here!
You can return the rags of those dames with whom you've been sinning!
"If you would at least admit to it, but no..."
You're a coward and you lie...
Lie...
"Whoever lies, steals and whoever steals..."
"No, I'll mess up the baptism..."
You hang yourself alone.
Old fool!
Now then...
Father of the child?
"You know, jim, i'm just crazy enough to go with you, but how are we going to get back across that line?"
"You-all know, folks, i'm on my way to savannah, georgia, to join my regiment, and i'm giving my good english friend here, sir nicholas boyd, safe conduct."
"Ah, yes, of course."
"And i'm buying cotton for dear old england, eh, what?"
You sure is.
"You sure is making me mighty nervous, you sure is."
You-all's price is right with me.
I'll take your whole doggone crop.
"I say, fraser, you better move all this cotton onto the dock immediately and make some bally room for the 200 bales coming in in the morning."
"Perkins, go up to the stonington railroad, tell them to run 20 freight cars onto our dock before 3:00."
We're gonna put a lot of money in the bank today for jim and nick.
Do you smell it?
What?
New england.
We're home again.
Jim!
Nick!
"Oh, hello, nick!"
Luke!
"Oh, jim."
"Gee, you haven't changed a bit."
Neither have you.
"My, you're a sight for sore eyes."
Our general manager.
"Gee, jim, i'm so happy."
"I can't wait, i've got a bet on with jim."
Tell me-what were the total profits on all that cotton we shipped up here?
"$821,000.46 in gold."
821 thou?
"Why, that's 100,000 more than we expected."
How did you do it?
Luke- you're the eighth wonder of the world.
But I've come for the singing - my teacher put me down on the list.
Baker.
You're an hour late.
Am I?
Bakers get up early.
Baker's the one with the music teacher's recommendation.
"So you wouldn't make a very good baker, would you?"
Do you have an excuse?
"Oh, he will have."
Sinners always do.
Judas had an excuse when he betrayed our Lord.
That sniper on Vimy Ridge had an excuse when he shot my leg off.
"All right, Kirkby, keep it Methodist."
Let's give him five minutes.
"Stand by the piano, please, Baker."
Face this way and really sing out.
Do you know your note?
"It's a B, Miss."
# I want to make you proud I want my song to let you see
# Who I can be when I belong
"# I'll give you all I have, I'll never swerve"
# I'll be the boy that you deserve
# See who I am A boy with a heart
# A boy saying please won't you choose me
# Breathe on my dreams don't blow them apart
# Turn me away and you'll lose me.
# He wants to make you proud he wants to shine
# He wants to hear you say that boy is mine
# We know your love is there just in disguise
# He needs to see it in your eyes
"# Look who I am, a boy with a heart"
# A boy saying please won't you choose me
"Yeah, let's go."
"[Man] In John 10:10, Jesus tells us..."
"""I came so that everyone would have life and have it in its fullest."""
"So, since God planned for us to have peace and happiness in this life right now... why are so many of us... hurting and angry inside?"
It's because we refuse to believe in God's unconditional love for us.
God created us in his image for one reason only... so that we could know him personally and have a joy-filled life.
That's it.
There's no catch.
There's no hidden agenda.
The Lord sacrificed His only Son for us... paying the penalty for our sins so that we might know true contentment.
"It sounds too good to be true, but it isn't."
God's provided the way.
We must make the choice.
[Chattering]
Oh.
Excuse me.
Paige!
"Hi, sweetheart."
Wow.
You look so beautiful.
You must be Paige's parents.
Such an honor to meet you.
Your daughter has been such a blessing to us.
She's a blessing to us too.
- Paige says you work in travel.
- Yeah.
"Well, we take a mission trip every year."
We should talk.
- Mmm.
"- Yeah, we..."
"Yeah, we should."
We'd love it if Paige could join us on one of our trips... see all the good her generous donations are doing.
"I saved a child, but failed in my delivery."
God's ways are hard for us to penetrate.
"Benvolio, you can come no further."
Now take this letter early in the morn and see you deliver it to my lord and father.
"Farewell, Benvolio."
Let us say good night.
No.
But... but why descend into this bed of death?
"Partly, I must behold my lady's face."
"Chiefly, I'd return this precious ring to her fair hand which gave it me."
And now be gone.
"I go, and do not seek to question you."
By which you show your love.
"Goodbye, dear friend."
"Banished Romeo Montague, who murdered Juliet's cousin, noble Tybalt... causing her the grief that took her to the grave."
And now he comes to desecrate the dead.
Leave them to heaven and attend to me.
"We needs must fight, for you are bound to die."
The very reason why you find me here.
"I am Count Paris, and I here defend the grave of she who should have been my bride."
"Oh, good, gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man."
Put not another sin upon my head by urging me to fury.
"Oh, fly hence."
"Be gone, survive."
What?
Should I buy this proof of your concern?
Or is a Montague afraid to fight?
"May God bless you, Paris."
Friar!
Friar Laurence!
- Friar Laurence!
- Who's there?
- Ha!
Ha!
I'd hardy call fertilizer bomb-making equipment.
"No, no, no, no, the fertilizer's outside."
I put the bomb-making stuff in the community room closet for authenticity.
"Wait, wait, wait, what other bomb-making stuff?"
"A lot of electronics, gasoline, nails, combustible hairspray."
- It's in the community room?
"- Yes, in the closet."
In the closet?
"No, Baber, no."
"No, no, no."
"You realize if someone catches wind of this,"
"You could actually be in serious trouble, right?"
"Ah, I can take it!"
"I'm very tough, I'd survive Gitmo."
Tough?
You're afraid of the moon!
I don't like the way it looks at me.
Ugh.
"You do know that Gitmo's not taking new prisoners, right?"
You'd wind up somewhere much worse like the moon.
"- OK, I'll be good."
- Yeah.
"Now, let's go."
Let's get that stuff in your van and you can return it to the store.
[ dove cooing ]
"This place is a real steal, guys."
"But like I said, I shouldn't be showing it to you, the place is set for demolition."
Are you telling me this used to be an old schoolhouse?
Who would want to demolish this?
It's amazing!
- So we sit here and wait?
"- For once, she's right, Mike."
We gotta do somethin'.
"We're gonna hand him over to the U.S. Attorney, get him into Witness Protection."
- Won't she still come afteryou?
- We'll deal with that later.
"Sam, I need you to call the U.S. Attorney."
Tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
- I'm on it.
"- And, uh... somebodyneeds to go to mymom... see that she's safe, make her house secure."
- Think she's cooked dinneryet?
"- I'm sure she'll heat somethin' up foryou, Sam."
"Well, then I'm on that too."
Fi...
I need you to prep an armed escort.
Doug.
I need you... to stay away from the windows.
You say this is just a precaution?
"Oh, yeah."
It's nothin' to worry about.
"Um, say, um, this is a little embarrassing, but, uh... me and my lady friend, uh, had a falling out, and... well, Mike thought maybe itwould be okay ifl, uh, crashed here forthe night."
"Sam, I'm not an idiot."
You want to tell mewhat's goin' on?
"Well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats."
- Against me?
- Not specifically.
"Well, I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical type thing... so it's nothing to worry about, but Mike wanted me to stay here and giveyou some... you know, self-defense pointers in case I had to leave."
You gonna leave this here with me when you go?
Okay.
"Be careful, okay?"
'Cause that's loaded.
Yeah.
She won't say a thing.
It's like she's thinking really hard about something.
We think...
We think that Maria doesn't remember a thing.
- What do you mean?
- She won't talk about it.
"We tell her about things like you and your house, but all she says is I don't remember."
Foguinho thinks she doesn't want to remember.
"If you ask me, she simply can't."
What did she say when you told her it was time to live with me?
She said she wants to stay in the circus forever.
I see.
"We explained that this is not possible, 'cause she is too little to work by herself like that."
She didn't like it one bit.
"I'm no educated woman like you, Mrs. Maria Cecflia, but I'm very candid and say what's on my mind."
It's a crying shame that Maria can't stay with us.
"You're her grandma, and you have the right but I think she'd be happier with us."
The magic rope trick requires great concentration.
- Are you concentrating?
- Yes!
My assistant Maria will give me a hand for the magic rope trick.
"Maria, pull very hard."
- Are you very concentrated?
- Yes!
"Let go, Maria."
"Foguinho, we're late."
There's a show tonight.
Thank you.
- Bye-bye.
"- Bye, kids."
Is it time already?
"Show us another trick, Foguinho!"
I don't know.
I could teach you your abc's.
In that case I might be a willing pupil.
Are you one of those rich refugees coming here looking for more money?
And sympathy.
"Well, I 'm not in the sympathy market yet but I guess we're both in the money market."
What're you gonna do in America?
"Oh, maybe I'll steal a little."
What do you do?
"I float, I drift."
I look...
"That's the man, officer."
What's the trouble?
You were on the ship that just came in?
"I'm awfully sorry about this, but my wallet was taken out of my pocket while I was getting my baggage."
Would you care to search me?
With your permission.
That's not my wallet.
Clementi Sabourin.
Is that your name?
Yes.
Is that what people do to each other in America?
Everybody frisking everybody else?
I'm awfully sorry.
"Tell me, uh... did you have very much money in that wallet?"
"I had about five hundred in currency, a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars..."
Of course I can have that stopped at the bank.
But there was a very important document.
"Well, I'm sorry you couldn't find it."
And so am I.
"This man does not have your wallet, sir."
We'll have to go back to the pier.
"Becky, give me a minute, will you?"
"Trevor, you know better than to come here."
"Yeah, I know."
I'm sorry.
We talked about this.
"Yeah, I know, Clark, but, please, I really have to talk to you."
- Not here.
Not now.
- But it's important.
"I'll come by as soon as I can, but get the hell out of here, and don't ever come back."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, ok."
That's much better.
That's much better.
Now you have to turn these both around.
This signature.
And then bring it...
Get everyone in there.
There are approximately two hours between Ramon's abduction here and his escape here.
He crossed the train tracks here.
"Now, given the time and distance parameters, there's no way the unsub could have ventured outside this radius."
"Ok, he said the train was close, and he heard laughter and loud music."
I looked at points of interest next to the train tracks and there really isn't much.
"There's a warehouse, a taco stand that would have been closed, and a bar called the Drunken Dog."
Why stop there?
He need a drink?
He doesn't seem like the drinking type.
He's not impulsive or sloppy enough.
"I live to serve you, sir."
"Garcia, what can you tell us about a bar called the Drunken Dog?"
"Ooh, I like it already."
Let's see.
"Uh, it's been around 30 years."
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Fandor!
Open up!
"Of course, the wires have been cut."
What has happened?
You're in such a mess!
It is impossible for Fantomas to leave this room.
I have the same opinion.
Who are you?
"Inspector Juve, police."
I thought you were dead!
"I was such a bore in the next world with my stories of Fantômas, that they sent me back to Earth."
You feel better?
"Okay, okay."
I tried to help.
And someone hit me on the head.
So it's you who entered first?
Obviously since my room is the closest to yours.
Why do you say that Fantômas has not come out of this room?
He was able to leave by the window.
The glass is broken.
And his mask is hooked.
I can assure you that Fantômas did not escape through this window.
Why try to deny the obvious?
The evidence?
"You know, sir, that you're in the fourth floor, that there is no ledge or balcony, that unless proven otherwise, nobody saw Fantomas fly."
He only smashed the glass to give the change and delude us.
If not by the window so how did he get out?
"In any case, not by the door either."
"If they ain't got your back, and you find you somebody else, 'cause it--"
She--she done been up there.
Look.
I'm saying--I'm gonna show you how she ain't have my back.
"I'm gonna tell you, okay?"
"We're in the Bahamas, people."
Physically how she didn't have my back.
We're in the Bahamas.
"Now, I'm doing something I shouldn't be doing, swimming."
I said I shouldn't be doing it.
I didn't say I couldn't do it.
I said I shouldn't have been doing it.
"I was in the water, swimming."
I swam all the way out to where the buoys were.
"I was just swimming like, ""A-ha-ha, a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha."""
"I looked in the water, and I seen this big brown thick thing with fins and teeth coming towards my pinky toe."
"Oh, it was a shark."
I kid you not.
"And I was trying to get her attention, because when you're in a relationship and you're in danger, you're supposed to have safety signals amongst one another that you can read, right?"
"So I went just like this, ""Unh, unh, unh."""
"That means, ""Bitch, get the lifeguard."""
That's what that means.
"But she ain't understand it, right?"
So she's on the shore thinking I'm swimming fast for her benefit.
"So she's like, ""Whoo, yes!"
"Baby, go faster!"""
"Whoo!"""
"That's how she sounds, I swear to God."
"""Whoo!"""
"I got back to the shore, I was like,"
"""Excuse me, did you not realize."
"""I almost got killed by a shark?"
What happened?
Nothing.
-What happened?
-l just got scared.
Got the keys?
"What happened, Karen?"
"I just got scared, Henry. lt's okay."
Are you all right?
-Yeah.
If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
So your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
The people who have cared for you all of your life.
And they always seem to come when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
I got there 15 minutes early and Jimmy was already there.
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
"On the surface, everything was supposed to be fine."
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat him out to save my neck.
"I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the fuckin' phone."
"Now you understand, huh?"
It's going to be okay.
I think you got a good chance of beating the case.
"Well, you know that kid from the city we were talking about?"
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
Serve them!
I knew it was a fish from the beginning!
Thank you.
- Here.
"- Don't let anyone see, alright?"
"- Here, take it."
- We only got it today.
That's absurd!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go!
Bastard!
Jean Louis!
My mother told me I'd find you in Capri.
So what are you doing in this corner of the world?
It's my duty to come here for the revolution.
"Ah, yes, I had forgotten about Count Marx."
And I had forgotten how deep your cynicism runs.
Yours and that of your entire generation.
"Come Jean Louis, you wouldn't be a student of Marx... if his blood wasn't much bluer than yours."
And where is it written that you have to be a proletariat in order to fight for justice?
You don't understand the youth of today... you can't imagine how different they are.
You wouldn't recognize the world that will come out of this world.
The imperialists and their lackeys will be defeated.
"Hey, Malaparte, Jimmy sends word that he can't come."
He was supposed to bring me a medic.
Did something happen?
"No, no."
He won't be able to come
He wants you to cover for him.
We have to go.
Ciao.
Now Oscar should be given for your performance.
I need to look at face of Vasu and my son once.
Open the box.
- Sir please..
I said open the box..
- Can't bear seeing this.
Open it..
Open it!
Deepak!
How was the shock?
Have you enjoyed or not?
Are you the Police guy?
"- What is this agony, sir?"
"Did you think about killing madam who gave you a great life, her son and my sister?"
It is wrong.
It is very wrong..
- Meaning..
You fool!
How can I let all this happen when I am there?
Sorry sir!
How can I hold your collar?
I would make you hit and run on the streets.
"I will exuviate your blood, bastard!"
You had shown only dual characters so many years.
I showed you dual role.
Not understand?
It was me who hit on your businesses as the Police officer.
It was me who exposed your flashback to madam by joining as the PA.
Your son has died for the sins you committed.
"After knowing about you, I thought you were a villain."
I now came to know that you are not even that.
I hate myself for being the wife to a fellow like you all these years.
- I'm not in the militia.
- What's going on here?
- Keep out of this.
"No, don't do that."
"In my hospital, we don't usually leave the injured lying on the floor."
- Put him back on the drip.
"- Today, he's been lucky."
But I won't always be here to keep our men back.
"It's my job to help people, regardless of their political camp."
Does that mean you don't distinguish between victims and executioners?
He needs an operation now.
Do you have an operating theatre?
"Yes, but we don't have a doctor any more."
If you could assist me...
I can.
I studied medicine.
Our friend Benítez obviously isn't losing any time.
Right.
They'll soon be able to get supplies from the north again.
He's a cunning old fox.
I wonder how they managed to finish the bridge so quickly.
We must blow that thing up.
Look at that.
"Hey, that lorry was part of the ammunition transport."
"- Yes, we couldn't be more lucky."
- There'll be some fireworks!
All we need to do is attach the explosives.
"Hey, leave that bag here and go and meet Emiliano."
Stop!
Get out of the car!
"Come on, hurry!"
Listen.
They're supposed to surrender?
How can they waste their time on such nonsense?
- Carrasco will never surrender.
- I read it.
Why did you lie?
Because I'm convinced that it isn't true.
I'm not sure if I should believe it or not.
I no longer know what he's capable of.
- What makes you think he didn't do it?
"- It's too terrible, too incomprehensible."
I don't believe that he is a man who would cause such a catastrophe by mistake.
- Are you implying that?
- Yes.
Silveira.
Not even a bastard like Silveira is capable of something like this.
Why would they make Carrasco a martyr by killing him?
"No, Mariá."
This is just what they needed.
A stab right into the people's heart.
Very good.
"In a few days, you won't feel any more pain."
It barely hurts now.
Thanks.
- A total triumph.
- You didn't manage to arrest him.
How can you call it a triumph?
It makes me sick to look at this burnt plane.
- It could have been me.
- So you know you've been lucky this time.
- One more impertinence...
- You've been lucky.
Who knows how many more times you will be?
A girls' orchestra.
"She missed the tram, I caught up with her, officer, uniform.. she fell for it."
I greeted her and said:
I don't mind... wait... I said:
I don't mind escorting you even if it's several kilometres on foot.
Who wouldn't fall for that?
So I escorted her.
"Vinohrady, Streleck¨¢ 12... 23."
He's burbling on!
You missed the tram.
"I did, because it was... lt wasn't yet the Protectorate, but it was already looking gloomy."
I was impressed by the fact that she didn't want it:
Do you mind!
I have always been a protector of frail women.
"I was more frail than I am now, there's no arguing about that."
And she said to me:
"Slovaks have always impressed me, but not ones who go to pubs."
I said:
"D'you mind, I'm bored here."
"Where are those moments, the time I was young."
Then came the day when a dream died.
When a night moth stretched out its wings
A night moth in love means love's lost and in vain.
It flies into the darkness.
Love's both a joy and a pain.
I'm so worried about Mi?
ka.
What did you say?
That I'm worried about our Mi?
ka.
"I trust her, but I don't want her to experience some disappointment."
"She's going away for two months, to a new environment."
Finally.
"Lucy, I'm home."
- How did you find this place?
"- Oh, you didn't know?"
Richie gets chatty in car rides.
"First him, now my Uncle Eddie?"
What the fuck is it with you?
Why do you keep messing with my family?
I think they call it destiny.
Then I guess you had this coming.
- What the hell's this?
- Are you kidding me?
- I will fucking kill you!
"- Hey, guys."
Hey!
Goddamn it!
Knock it off!
Get over there!
Get over there!
"First one to move, I swear to God I'll knock you on your ass."
You...
"You guys are unbelievable, you know that?"
I've been lookin' for a job like this for years.
"And you two punks show up outta nowhere and run roughshod all over it with all this ""get outta my sandbox"" bullshit?"
You know what you're like?
You're like... those lab rats.
"You know, the lab rats that push the button for the candy, they just keep pushin' again and again."
They don't give a shit about anybody or anything!
"This job is my swan song, my masterpiece."
"And once I pull this off,"
"I can sit around in my soft pants and watch my stories, think about that perfect caper that we  that we pulled off."
"So Seth, you either stand behind me, or you get the hell out of my way."
You are not my mother.
And you are not my child.
"You know, since we're talking, with mouths -- not really an opportunity that comes along very often --"
"I just want to say, you know, you have never been very reliable."
And you have?
You didn't always take me where I wanted to go.
"No, but I always took you where you needed to go."
You did.
"Look at us, talking!"
"Wouldn't it be amazing, if we could always talk, even when you're stuck inside the box?"
You know I'm not constructed that way.
I exist across all space and time and you talk and run around and bring home strays.
I do really feel like they're soulmates.
"They're best friends, they're siblings, they're family."
They can't live without each other.
You can't have one without the other.
"In the top 3 saddest moments of ""Doctor Who"""
was when the TARDIS had to go back to being a TARDIS.
She just wanted to say
"""Hello."""
I'm alive.
"""Alive"" isn't sad."
It's sad when it's over.
"I'll always be here, but this is when we talked and, now, even that has come to an end."
There's something
I didn't get to say to you.
Goodbye.
No.
I just wanted to say hello.
"Hello, Doctor."
Doctor.
"It's so very, very nice to meet you."
"My dear citizens, we are living in difficult times."
"Once again, our people's enemies have shown their true, cruel, bloody colours."
Their cowardly terrorist attacks only hit those they claim to be fighting for.
If their true aim was political change in this country...
- Pass the ball to me.
"- Come on, children, we must go."
Hurry up.
Come on.
"Run, run, run."
Get into the car.
"Come on, hurry up."
"Doctor, are you really going to leave us?"
The guerrilleros will be here soon.
They're killers.
Haven't you heard the news?
- I don't want to be here when they come.
- They don't fight doctors and priests.
These people don't know what a conscience or a God is.
All they know is violence.
"If they come, they'll destroy this town."
The militia would be just as bad.
- I don't feel like dying.
- You can't shirk your responsibilities.
- You can't let the hospital down.
"- Padre, listen to me."
"I get paid for my medical services, not for heroism."
Why should I stay?
Just to cure a few sick people?
You stay.
Perhaps you'll be canonised one day.
But I...
"I need my hat, not a halo."
When he thought there was a shirt under it.
I totally remember that.
"Rafi thought there was a shirt under my shirt when we were rehearsing and lifted up my hoody, and there wasn't a shirt under my shirt."
"I have to say, though, they don't..."
"Should I have to say, in a scene, that you should not pull up a girl's shirt?"
Don't pull up Kat's shirt in this one.
"I mean, am I supposed to say that in every scene?"
"I made it seem like it was Pete's fault, but it wasn't."
At least I was wearing a brassiere.
- Rafi was hoping to catch a glimpse.
"- No, I don't think he was."
- Rafi blamed it on his character.
"- Can I, like, reveal a secret?"
He was in character.
"This is embarrassing, but I wanna say it because you guys are here."
"After that happened, I re-created my crouch in my trailer pulled up my shirt to see what I look like."
Re-created your what?
"I was, like, ""I need do some crunches."""
"- Oh, my gosh."
- You are so much.
"- Oh, no."
- That's what you do in your trailer?
That's what I...
"I know, it was really insecure of me."
"I like this part, Ari."
"We should talk about this stunt, Ari."
"- Oh, God, is this the...?"
- I didn't not...
"- Well, I accidentally hit it once."
- You hit your head once.
- But there was padding on the door.
- Should we talk about where this is?
How can I help you?
Okay.
Meet me at the station.
Desmond Bennett wants to make a statement.
Probably wants to make a deal.
Can't wait to wipe that smug British grin off his face.
Cool.
I'll wait for forensics.
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, and then I'll go arrest our girl."
All right.
My patients...
"Morgan Lewis, Ethan Grant, Troy Dixon."
What's this?
That's a video statement.
Each patient has one.
Is physical evidence really a good idea?
We decided we needed an insurance policy.
"In case we ever got caught, we have a legal contract and statement that proves the patient gave consent."
You think this is gonna hold up in court?
I hope I never have to find out.
How do we find our patients?
They come to us.
"Well, we're gonna have to do something about that, maybe hire some death dealers."
I'm not soliciting death.
You should be.
What else?
Now we practice injections.
Hold your arm out.
You're a funny girl.
"Relax, it's saline."
"I think you misunderstand the nature of our relationship here, Mary."
Maybe the phone call hadn't worked.
But it had.
All I had to do was wait.
He was right on schedule.
"I was thinking, ""Go ahead."
"Beat it to your big beach home. """
This is the same gag you pulled on me.
It's even the same corpse.
Only thing missing is a sledgehammer highball and a pair of snake-eyes dice.
There was one joker.
What if he'd left a goon to watch his office?
"Here I was again, back to the scene of the TNT highball with the pretty girl camouflaging the safe."
Martinelli left in a hurry.
He hadn't turned the radio off.
"Not that I don't like music, but I work better in silence."
"I'm crazy about you, sweetheart, but move over."
"She moved over, Father."
The safe was wide open.
Martinelli really had hauled freight in a hurry.
"After my trouble to get Martinelli out, this would be dandy."
"I kept thinking, ""lt had to be here somewhere. """
"Up to now, everything had gone like grief."
He had the letter.
He'd been working on it.
But he hadn't gotten very far with his homework.
He was doing research on that letter but good.
The Leising Book of Codes.
Here was the real merchandise.
I recognized Johnny's writing.
Martinelli!
Martinelli!
"Then, suddenly, I got a whiff of jasmine."
He was crying.
"Very, very upset."
He wanted to go home.
To his mommy.
And I wanted to send him home.
But I knew I couldn't.
Then I told him I would take him.
"I put him in my car, started driving."
He kind of cheered up.
But of course I wasn't taking him home.
I was taking him... somewhere else.
- You're lying.
- Am I?
"Who else is lying about that day, Mark?"
Are you?
Are your friends?
Jesse was crying when I found him.
"Who made him cry, huh?"
The DNA tie-in with the missing kid is potentially huge.
For now this cannot get out.
We dig away until we know exactly what we are dealing with.
Don't want journalists banging on my door.
Danny.
The murder victim is yet to be ID-ed.
But we are tracing her mobile as it's possible the killer might have taken it with him.
Next.
"Now given the reputation of the murder location and the manner of her dress, we're working on the possibility that she was accepting payment for sex."
"So it could be a disgruntled client, partner of someone."
Or drug-related.
Every hooker I've encountered has been an addict.
We all know how many hookers Mickey's encountered.
"Yeah, it's very funny."
***
"Something with, uh, a lot of saturated fats in, please."
And yes to any questions about making it larger.
Alright?
Eating off the bonnet of your car.
Yeah.
"Cause you don't want the smell to get in the fabrics, do you?"
"Yeah, that's why I'm doing it."
Nothing to do with not wanting my family to know anything.
"Well, I can't take it back to the surgery cause Mary doesn't allow it."
"But you're the boss, right?"
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
So you allow Mary not to allow it.
It's policy.
Mary is very good with policy.
"We all dream of a world where you can eat burgers at work, and wear aftershave on days when it isn't your birthday."
"But work's never going to be like that, is it?"
"Yes, very used to dealing with large purchasing budgets."
And what do you think you can bring to the surgery personally?
If anything at all.
"Well I've had a look around, and it works."
It's fine.
Yes?
But no offense...
What do you mean?
"I mean first off the waiting room,"
I mean would it kill us to get a couple of plasmas in there?
I hardly think a doctor's waiting room...
"I'm sorry, I'm talking to the doctor."
No.
"No, it wouldn't kill us."
No.
Where's your mother?
I'm traveling all alone.
And you started wandering around the train and now you don't know where you're supposed to be?
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no!"
"I mean, I..."
"I do know where I'm supposed to be, in the day coach, but I don't like it there very much."
"I don't feel so good, right here."
I bet I know your problem.
You do?
Mmm-hmm.
"They gave you money to buy your dinner, and instead of that you bought some ice cream, and some candy and maybe some soda pop?"
"Yeah, and some marshmallows, and some cotton candy, and popcorn and cigarettes."
Cigarettes?
"Oh, I mean can-candy cigarettes, chocolate."
Oh!
Why don't you sleep here?
Here?
I'm sure your mother would want you looked after.
I'll call the conductor.
"Oh, no, don't do that."
Why?
"Oh, well, he doesn't like me, see, and... and he's not a nice man because we were talkin' about trains, and I told him I had 13 cars in my set,"
"and he only has 11, and he's jealous and nasty, he is."
"All right, then."
I'll ring for the porter.
"Oh, no."
"If you press that buzzer, I'll be killed!"
What an imagination!
"Well, don't you see?"
The porter and the conductor are in cahoots against me.
"Secondly, she prefers the term"
"""Adult Film Thespian."""
"And thirdly, I had a very good conversation with her, and hopefully, she's gonna stop doing..."
"Hundreds of men, women and objects?"
She doesn't do objects.
"She has a standard contract, and she doesn't do objects."
"She doesn't do animals, and she doesn't do water sports."
Although I don't really know what that is.
I think that's...
doing it on a jet ski?
"Oh, boy."
Yep.
Why would anyone want to do that on a jet ski?
"Okay, so what?"
- Were you able to talk her out of it?
- I think so.
Although she did most of the talking.
"If it wasn't for you, I never would have gotten to where I am today."
Thank you.
"You made me fall in love with math, Aaron."
"And with those skills, I've learned to invest my money, run my own website, and create a healthy and diversified portfolio."
That's cool.
That is really cool.
"You know, I think that I'm just curious if-if maybe you're interested in expanding."
"Oh, I totally do!"
I'm gonna start my own reality show where I take other porn stars out to dinner.
It's called Stuffing Liza Blue's Face.
Wow.
Great title.
God.
"You know, I love how encouraging you are."
That's why I've always had such a big crush on you.
"Oh, doctor!"
Doctor.
Good to see you.
How is our Gyung Joon?
Ah yes...
I see...
That he hasn't regained his consciousness yet.
"They say his body is all fine, so why isn't he waking up?"
"You don't think he's going to stay in that state like that, right?"
They say there's nothing wrong...
So I'm sure he'll wake up.
They say that people can stay in a state like that for several years.
Then what do we do about him?
Do we have to keep on taking care of him?
Doctor...
"That won't happen, right?"
"If by any chance, that happens, what are you going to do?"
Doctor.
We don't have the relationship where we have to take responsibility for him.
We're just relatives who have been left in charge for the time being.
The hospital shouldn't be asking us what should be done with him in the future.
-Honey!
-What?
Doctor...
"Then, goodbye."
"Ugh, this boy..."
Isn't there somewhere in America where we can send him off to just in case?
Who would take care of him?
"Since he grew up there, there has to be someone he was close to!"
It's because there was no such person that he came to Korea!
What should we do with his belongings?
-Gyung Joon...
Okay.
I'll get corroboration from another source.
Thank you.
"All right, Dad, what did we do wrong this time?"
Nothing. I just... I have something I have to tell you guys.
is somebody sick?
"No, sweetie, it's nothing like that."
"Something has happened at work, or because of work, and I don't know that it's bad yet."
"It's too soon to tell, but it might be bad."
- You're going broke?
"- No, but I suppose it could happen."
- There's an investigation of Atlantor.
- By the police?
"Sort of, yeah."
It's called a grand jury.
- [Eli] That's serious.
- [Jessie] Do you get arrested?
"No, honey."
"No, no."
It's not like that.
[Jessie] Then what's wrong?
"Well, I'm not exactly sure, and that's part of the problem."
"There are some people who could be arrested,"
- l guess.
- But not you.
"Well, there's nothing they would arrest me for."
We should not worry about this before anything...
You're saying you could be arrested?
"Well, anything's possible, E, but, no, I really don't think that that's what this is about."
"Jess, honey, listen, listen to me."
"I do not think anything bad is going to happen, okay?"
"I can't guarantee you that, and I'm sorry."
"What is important for a journalist, is to keep readers in suspense, so they'll want to buy the newspaper."
At the expense of the truth?
I never wrote anything false.
I just give enough elements so the reader can imagine what he wants.
"I'm losing my mind, you know."
Elizabeth our only chance to clarify this story is to remain united.
I ask you to do that for your brother.
And for me.
We're going to choose the cake.
Okay.
Which one?
This one.
What is it?
Who is there?
"The injection, quick!"
Pick up the list.
It is on the desktop.
Here it is.
You're lucky.
"If you had not saved me from the guillotine in the past,"
I would have strangled you.
To leave this list lying about...
Fortunately the police didn't find it.
I did not realize when you had asked me to pick it up.
It is you who have written it on this desktop.
I thought that you had taken it.
This is a misunderstanding.
The incident is closed.
It remains to know whether the girl has seen it.
The sheet was returned.
"Yes, but you never know."
"And when in doubt, I do not abstain."
"If I go there, I got to shop around."
I'm too lazy to choose.
"You can go out, just to hang out."
It's fun.
"What do you mean, ""go out just to hang out?"""
Go out just to hang out you know?
I don't get it.
What are you saying?
Sometimes I think you are messing with me.
I'm not messing with you.
Why would I do that?
What do you find entertaining?
Hmm...
Thinking of new projects.
Hey that is work.
No.
Work is when someone hires us to do something.
This is thinking of stuff to do on our own.
Then how about sports?
Sports?
I like to play badminton but I have no one to play with.
You don't meet up with your friends at all?
I meet them sometimes at funerals and weddings.
"But I can't really invite anyone out, since my schedule always changes."
Do you have a girlfriend?
Dang!
This has anything to do with my rash?
Seriously.
"Some people think there is no link, but a patient's lifestyle has an effect on their disease."
"And if I don't, what is your medical opinion on having one or not?"
It actually depends on the person.
"Some people have one and it's good, but for some, it's bad."
Dalton.
"Hi, it's Megan."
"Oh, hi, how are ya?"
How's it going?
"Oh, it's goin' fine."
"Our lab boys picked up a bloody footprint in the, uh, meat packing plant."
"They, uh, matched it with a size 10 hunting boot, manufactured by a firm in Maine."
He only sells mail order.
"Well, you think he's from Maine?"
"Well, our computer checked their records with all sale of that size with army records, and we finally have us some suspects."
Why do you think he was in the army?
"Well, uh, one of the ghoul's girlfriends picked out the m-16 machine gun as a weapon the ex..."
"Uh, the exterminator used when he broke up their party."
About the only way you can get one is stealing it from the army.
You think you're gonna catch him?
"Oh, we'll-we'll catch him, all right."
But it's gonna take some doing.
"The computer gave us 2,000 suspects."
Now it's gonna take a lot of knocking on a lot of doors.
What are you doing right now?
"Uh, well, I'm a just going over some lab reports and just lookin' for clues."
Do you want to take a break?
Yeah.
"Well, there's a good jazz concert at battery park."
"All right, I, uh..."
I can be there in about thirty minutes.
Good.
"Okay, see you there."
"Ladies and gentlemen, Stan guest."
[Applause]
[Music playing]
Megan?
So you're accusing us of corporate espionage and murder.
That's absurd.
John Cutler was gunned down in a secluded cabin managed by your company.
You gonna tell me that was a coincidence?
Yes.
If that's what actually happened.
"What do you mean, ""if it happened""?"
I was there.
I saw it happen.
"Well, I'm sorry, but I haven't heard anything about a murder at one of our properties, so... you must be mistaken."
There's been no mistake.
You guys killed Cutler and then you covered it up.
Show me some proof.
(door buzzes)
Well... ask and you shall receive.
BENNER:
What's this?
CHIN:
That's a lab report.
"See, we just matched up the tire tracks found at the scene to a van registered to your company."
How's that for proof?
STEVE:
So why don't you tell me what happened with Cutler.
Did he up his price and it piss you off?
Maybe you thought he'd been compromised.
What happened?
What happened?
!
(sighs)
"Yes, Cutler was spying for us."
"Yes, we scrubbed the crime scene."
"But we didn't kill him, come on."
Are Claire and Alex natural?
"He wants me, Mother!"
I'm sure he wants you.
He wants you to cook and clean for him!
- He found you through an ad.
"- I already know, Mom."
Sorry.
"It's not your average proposal, but let's face it."
They're not standing in line for me.
And we like each other!
Then say yes!
I can live alone.
"If you think such a marriage is normal, then go ahead."
Why do you do that?
Why do you make it sound so pathetic?
You had a life.
A husband who adored you.
Can't I have some of that?
"I'm getting older, too."
Why can't you be happy for me?
"But you can't, can you?"
You're scared to death of being alone.
And you're jealous.
Jealous because a man wants me.
A good-looking man.
How ridiculous!
"Well, you know something, Mom?"
A man does.
"Today, Gregory Larkin and Rose Morgan have exchanged rings and agreed to recognize each other as equals."
They shall seek a life of kindness and understanding.
The ceremony of marriage is a means of establishing a home.
"And as you have exchanged vows before witnesses, by the authority vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife."
And you won't get thirsty either.
"Oh, good."
That way I can slosh my way through my twilight years.
[Gurgling]
Bob?
I hope I went peacefully
"Sorry, Emily."
I didn't know you were awake.
Bob?
What are you doing?
"Oh, I... couldn't go to sleep, sol thought I'd weigh myself."
"- Well, how much did you lose?"
- I'm afraid I'm like the stock market.
I'm up an eighth.
"Emily, this diet isn't working."
"Well, Bob, you've gotta give it a chance."
You've only been on it five hours.
"Emily, I gai-I gained an eighth of a pound in five hours."
"Well, that's all the water you've been drinking."
I can't understand it.
"I never had a problem with weight... and then all of a sudden, I weigh 10 pounds more than I did on our wedding night."
You weighed yourself on our wedding night?
I had nothing else to do.
You were in the bathroom for 45 minutes.
How could she fly off the bed like that?
Pathological states can induce abnormal strength accelerated motor performance.
For example say a 90-pound woman sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck runs out and lifts the wheels a half a foot up off the ground.
You've heard the story.
Same thing here.
"Same principle, I mean."
So what's wrong with her?
We still think that the temporal lobe--
"Oh, I don't know, Nate."
We can't just leave her in the grizzled hands of a predator.
"- Well, we can't take her either."
- Why not?
Because that would be abducting her.
"I know, but she's just a child, Nate."
"Mm-hmm, and that's called child abduction, which is a crime, unlike what they're doing."
So you're just gonna side with him?
I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do!
"You think you're saving her from beautiful life as wife of rich doctor, followed by even better life as widow of rich doctor with no heirs?"
"Well, there has to be more to marriage than money."
- You think she gold digger?
"- No, I think you gold digger."
Look at you with your bracelets and that ring.
That ring.
I need you to tell me what he said.
I want you to leave now.
"Please, Mr Lee!"
I'm his mother!
Get out!
You coward!
"Mrs McCarthy, what a lovely hat."
It makes you look like royalty.
If only!
Mrs McCarthy... have you heard of a new restaurant in Cheltenham called
Gerard's Brasserie?
I was wondering if you'd care to join me there tomorrow lunchtime.
"Well, I have a WI meeting."
The speaker runs a cattery in Painswick.
"Well, surely the WI can do without you for one day."
"No, I don't think I will."
Why don't you tell her about Tulsa?
- Max...
"- No, tell her, Sal."
- She needs to know.
- What?
What happened in Tulsa?
"It was almost ten years ago, I guess."
We'd just started working for the Doctor.
"It was a... a long game... a real-estate scam... and about the hottest summer you can imagine, so I went to the movies a lot."
"And this guy was... sitting a few seats from me one night, and he offered me some Junior Mints."
His name was Martin.
And he was... just about the sweetest guy I ever met.
We just seem to fit.
"You know, sometimes you get a taste of real life, and it seems pretty all right."
"You start daydreaming, you know... about getting out for good."
So what happened?
"Well, let's just say the Doctor sent me a message... a little reminder that anybody not in the life, not like us, is a liability."
"And if you care about those people, you know... you have to be careful."
"And sweet Max... was there to put me back together, weren't you, Maxie?"
"Anything for you, Sal."
You know that.
"All right, I get it."
But this guy at the coffee shop... he's a nobody.
You don't have to worry.
"Really, I'm on it."
Want something?
Yeah.
"I'll have a Manhattan, please."
Keep the change.
I need a little favor.
You know what?
Put it on our tab.
"The mathematical world is completely rational, uncomplicated by sex."
"You think too much, hon."
Don't you want to know how big my tits are?
No!
I just want to share my life with someone.
- Someone I'm not sexually attracted to.
- What?
"How can two people come together for what's a lasting and substantial, mutual respect, genuine affection, in a world that's run by ad agencies selling great sex?"
"Take out your own ad, I guess."
- An ad?
- Mmm-hmm.
Look at me.
I'm a grown woman wearing a prom dress.
You are not.
You look adorable.
Adorable?
I look like an over-the-hill Barbie doll.
"It doesn't fit right, it's too tight."
Too many Sno Balls.
Why didn't you pick out something looser in my color?
Because maids of honor don't wear black.
It would help if you fixed yourself up a little bit.
- Why don't you wear some make-up?
- I am wearing make-up.
Let's go.
And your hair looks good today.
"I like it, the curls work."
Why don't you get a perm?
I tried that once.
I looked like Shirley Temple on crack.
Where the hell is she?
I'm gonna kill her!
Soon-shin...
I'm sorry to cause you concern once again.
Don't be silly.
We heard everything from outside.
I can' let you go alone.
I will round up the members of Deung-ryong and we will go together.
No!
"What do you mean, Master?"
Why are you stoping us?
"If we send him alone, there is no telling what they might do."
That's a cross Soon-shin alone must bear.
"I cannot obey you, Master."
I refuse to let him go alone!
Are you going to turn Deung-ryong institute into a martyrs' den?
Master...
"Kyun, Master is right."
Soon-shin!
What are you doing here?
Are you out of your mind?
You wish to make a deal?
That's right.
"If I don't return by 7:00 pm, your journal will be turned over to the Court of Equity."
Fool.
How are you going to prove that journal is mine.
You can't bring me down that easily.
"No, I can't prove anything."
"Even if I could, I'm sure your connections in the Courts of Equity will make that proof disappear."
If you now that why would be so foolish?
But if copies of that journal are delivered to Attendant Ju and Prime
"Minister Yoon, what then?"
"Along with a note saying that the original has been delivered to the Court of Equity as well, of course."
What?
Us becoming friends.
Kai...
"I came back here to have a normal life, not to screw up yours."
"No, you came back to undo a regret."
At first.
And then I realized that I can do a lot more than that.
I can rewrite my whole existence.
"No, you can't."
"I can, and I was, until you showed up."
"You know, getting in the middle, between you and Ethan, that was the old me, and I won't go down that road again."
And I'm not asking you to.
"We shoulda stuck to coffee and small talk, like I said."
I think that you're overreacting.
Really?
Yeah.
You think you can just say that... that you feel something for me and it doesn't change anything?
"Well, not if we don't let it."
Just do yourself a favor and stay away from me.
Kai...
I'm serious.
I'm done--
"With this whole screwed up situation, this friendship... or whatever the hell it is."
It's over.
"Relationships-- they feel so permanent, so solid."
"So why, are we always surprised to find out that, like everything else, they are not immune to change?"

Come on.!
"He's lookin'great, huh?"
I don't know.
Did he seem a trifle tense to you?
"Higgins, let's go.!"
"Well, just take all day, Higgy baby."
"Maybe beauty knows no pain, but I knew I did."
I figured the only way I could get through the day was to put my body on automatic pilot... and concentrate on something else.
The trouble was all I could think about was Roger.
"If Gold Teeth was right, he wasn't in a hell of a lot of trouble... not with the feds anyway."
"He'd stolen money, but he'd stolen it from a thief."
"If Roger turned it in before the statute of limitations on the crime ran out next week, he'd probably get a reward."
Hurry up.
They're due here any minute.
"All right, all right."
Which brought me to Barbara.
Why didn't he meet her at the airport?
"Did he have cold feet about marrying her, or... couldn't he show up because he knew someone was following her?"
"But if he knew, why didn't he just take the money and run?"
Call her in a couple of weeks from Tahiti or wherever?
Now remember the drill.
"T.C., you towel him dry, Right."
Get him into the running shorts.
Running shorts.
"Okay, Rick, shoes and socks."
Shoes and socks.
And don't forget the foot powder.
Foot powder.
I myself have exactly...
four ounces of glucose.
I'll get it.
I already did.
How about i call you big cutie?
"Like, big cutie, have some more treats."
- Thank you.
"- Hey, tom."
Sheila brought us rice crispy treats.
The guys are giving me a little fire fighter tutorial.
Damian wants to drive the rig when he gets on the job.
"Why don't you graduate first before you start picking out a goddamn locker, ok, punk."
"Come on, tommy, he's gonna graduate."
"Yeah, his instructor says that he's already top of the class so far."
"What are you, 3 weeks in?"
Stretching hose and doing physical training.
Got some guy that used to look up to your old man helping you put on your bunker gear every day.
"Wait till they stick your narrow ass in the smokehouse, ok, or you're roasting at 1,500 degrees in the goddamn flashover stimulator."
Then we'll see how big your balls are.
"Hey, asshole."
"I'm sorry, big cutie."
"Listen, why don't you back off my son."
"Because this ain't goddamn summer camp, ok, sweetie."
"And if I'm not mistaken, chief, isn't there a rule against social calls in the firehouse?"
"Don't be a stickler, tommy."
"Here, have a treat."
No thanks.
"Ok, duty calls."
"- Hey, can I ride along?"
- No.
"Oh, come on, chief, let the kid ride."
It'll be good for him.
- Only if his mother says it's ok.
"- Uh, it's ok."
"You stay clear of the action, ok?"
I've got to find some way to make money.
Why doesn't he just retire and let me run the business?
There's not a chance of that.
The business is his whole life and he's still in his prime.
Except for his absent-mindedness about appointments.
"You know,"
I think you've got something.
What do you mean?
The old boy is losing his grip.
He doesn't know what he's doing.
"When you can't remember business matters, it's time to retire."
John's got a memory like a file cabinet.
He never forgot anything in his life.
"Ellen thinks he forgot about my appointment, doesn't she?"
You know very well you never had an appointment.
I know it.
But does John?
Don't you get it?
He prides himself on his memory.
"If we can convince him that he is getting forgetful, then we'll be able to..."
"Oh, no!"
He'd be a nervous wreck in no time.
"Oh, what a horrible thought."
It was only an idea.
I think it's a wonderful horrible idea.
Something I can do?
Something you should've done three weeks ago.
Why haven't the contracts been sent to the Craddock people?
Just waiting for you to sign them.
What are you talking about?
I signed them a month ago.
"I'm sorry, John."
Bittu would have died and the other kid would have gone to jail.
This is the same thing that'll happen to Boss and Shiv.
I don't understand.
Boss will kill Shiv and will be executed for that.
But boss is our man!
I don't even trust my father.
"This an old habit of mine - first clear the garbage, then clear the record."
Why are you outside?
From today your outgoing and the phone's incoming are both out.
Go into your room and shut the door
And you can watch t.v
Untill I call you out...marriage must take place
Now go?
Ayushman boss arrive
Were is your boss?
My work is to release water.
Boss so much of power Your plant grew
This is what you call Power plant
So you are Ayushman Takur?
Arrange a meeting in the 5-star lobby.
Sir how can I assist you?
Will you kill Shiv in jail?
What are you saying Takur?
I know your story.
You clear garbage and then clean your record.
If I kill him in your jail won't you be investigated or not?
The media already has footage of you and that boy.
Why provoke more attention?
So what can we do boss
Kill Shiv not in jail but outside.
Superb!
"What do you say, Ayushman?"
"Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
- Good.
"- No, that's not good."
That's terrible.
"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can work in some witness protection.
"No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
"I'm gonna set your nephew straight, get him singing like a canary all's right with the world."
Ten thousand dollars.
"Ten thousand, cash to you."
I'm not saying to throw the case.
Just no talking to the DEA.
Are you saying what I think you're saying?
Yes.
What's it going to be?
"What, dude wouldn't take a bribe?"
That dude in there?
Saul Goodman we're talking about?
"Yeah. ""Morally outraged, "" he said."
Threatened to call the police.
"- Wait, and Badger is gonna spill?"
- Like the Exxon Valdez.
"So, what do we do about it?"
"Hey, Francesca, how about I follow you home?"
You have beautiful legs.
Thank you.
"I'm a bit too tall, aren't I?"
"No, you're perfect."
You look great.
"No, I'm too tall."
I wish I could cut them short.
"Come on, don't do that."
"Director Kim, guess you got to work on your script now."
I guess so.
What is it about this time?
I only have the title.
"""About Miracles."""
Does it sound too scholarly?
"""About Miracles,"" I see."
"- ""About Miracles."""
- Miracle?
What kind of miracle?
A man travels to a foreign beach and stays at a hotel.
And in his room he plays Mozart on his CD player.
Then he leaves his room and hears the same music on the lift.
"He walks out of the hotel, then takes a turn at the corner, and on the street is a clown."
He's doing his mime to the exact same music.
It's an incredible coincidence.
But this man doesn't think it's a mere coincidence.
He wonders why he heard the same music three times.
"And he concludes that if he can find the reason why this happened, he can unravel a secret to the world."
And he's obsessed with that thought.
So he starts tracking hints.
For ten years.
"First, he begins with info about the clown, the women he met, his preferences, everything."
Down to the speaker's brand in the hotel elevator.
Hood rat.
Huh.
"Oh, my God, you don't even know what are animals and what aren't."
"Okay, can we please just focus on the fact that in that moment we just made a pretty good team?"
"Well, yeah, I don't know, I didn't do much."
"Well, that's what a team is."
"You're not supposed to have the same strengths, you know."
You're supposed to trade off.
"Like, with the squirrel, I was strong, and with the mugger, you basically hung out with him and played Wii."
"You know, I'd like to see how brave you'd be if the little squirrel pulled out a tiny gun and asked you for your wallet."
"If the squirrel pulled out a tiny gun and asked for my wallet, we would be millionaires."
"Okay, in a hundred-meter sprint,"
I am beating you every time.
"In high school my nickname was ""fast Whitney."""
"Look, I'm sure that's true, but I'm talking about physical speed, all right?"
I'm pretty sure that I'm faster than you.
"Okay, you do a lot of things fast, but running is not one of them."
"All right, look, we're not having this discussion right now, all right?"
"Men are faster than women, end of story, good night."
- Really?
- Really.
"All right, on your marks, get set..."

You're an incredible mom to that bunny.
I guess I have changed.
You've evolved.
"And over the last 950 days we've been dating... and, yes, I've counted, and yes, I counted the Zach era, because, really, who were we kidding?"
...I've watched you grow into this incredible woman.
And that is who I love.
"Thanks, Cohen."
What's wrong?
I met GEORGE.
I'll kill him.
This guy came by from GEORGE to recruit me.
He heard about my work with the sea otters and invited me to travel across the country and talk to college kids about voting next November.
What about Brown?
"I'd have to defer a year, live on a bus."
Sounds like a great gig.
I don't know that we could see each other.
So you have to choose between me and GEORGE.
That's the thing-- I don't know that I have to.
"I do believe that you are my destiny, I do, Seth."
But I just don't know that you're my only destiny.
Here.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Mm-hmm.
I picked couples through time.
"Oh, and where are we?"
I was hoping that someday we could go in the middle.
So can I tell you what Bullit's surprise is?
I can't hold it any longer.
Sure.
His plane is sitting on the tarmac gassed up and ready to take you anywhere in the world.
"Mom, you're going to be spending Valentine's Day anywhere in the world that you want to go."
"I mean, that's pretty amazing."
I'm not.
You're perfectly justified to hate him.
I'm saying he's really gone back for me.
He's always been a good friend to me.
That's funny 'cause I thought I was your friend.
"Look, our friendship has always been outside the Greek system."
"You always said, you're not gonna let our houses get in the way of us being friends."
So let's not lose that.
I see you later.
Hey heavy Poo!
You're here to give the dean his morning foot massage.
"You know, I don't think I've ever seen you in the sunlight before noon."
You're getting troubles with the law again?
100 hours of community service.
I consider myself lucky though.
"Could have been a lot worst, I was the only one who got busted."
"And by the way, you're a total dushbag."
Why's that?
Because you raided out our party.
I knew it was someone on the Greek task force
You're the only one I know with personal vendetta.
"Still, pretty low."
even for you.
Now you'll think twice before trying to pouch one of your pledges.
He came to us.
I don't know why I'm bothering explaining myself to you.
Take care.
Bing.
- What did you call me?
- You heard.
"Just to let you know, there will be retribution."
Bring it.
How many kills you have made?
You really didn't know that i am Bhai (brother)
How would i know?
Then why you were waiting for me in the restaurant?
That's my restaurant.
I have been inform that you are coming there so i bought my beg there.
So Bhai(brother) call you and send me to kill you.
What?
Your boss is bhai (brother)?
Yeah... you know it was my first murder.
"For this bounty, mother have paid lot of bounty in Mandir."
She went to Sidhivinayak every Tuesday by walking.
"For ""my son get one change to murder."""
"After that much ganpati, i got one chance."
"I though by one murder, i could steel my life."
"Then i will marry to daughter of Chora Khujli, and make my life."
But... because of me every thing gone wrong.
Kill me.
Laxmi kill me.
"What are you saying, you don't have to worry."
"I am here, from today i will stand before you if any bullet comes to you what?"
You will fight with you boss for me?
Now i will show Bhai(brother) what is Bhaigiri(gangster)
Leaving... your just call wife's ring.
"Not nessescery... i will come back soon, i will wait."
Bhai (brother) you are here?
Open grave and hidden new can be seen from far away.
Work has done?
You were right bhai (brother)
My loose motion has stopped Bhai.
"Here is you stuff, your diamonds."
"See, have you seen Chota Khujli."
"What does Harry have to say this morning, my dear?"
"I said, what does Harry say this morning?"
"Oh, nothing much."
I'll wager my gout hurts him more than it does me.
Does he send any news I can hear?
"Oh, he just says that he walked through the East End recently."
"""I have never seen such deplorable housing conditions."
"Surely the city fathers should find the funds to..."""
"Well, then he just goes on to say about the housing conditions."
They must be pretty dreadful.
He's quite right.
They're disgraceful.
I was saying at the club before I left.
"Now, there's a problem Harry could get his teeth into."
He's just the man to...
"Here, here, my dear."
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I suppose I'm just not very interested in housing conditions at the moment.
You mean because a man doesn't cover the pages with sentiment?
Nonsense.
"A woman must learn to read between the lines, my dear."
"Yes, I like the tone of that letter."
"And what's more, my dear, I think my gout is getting very much better."
"- Oh, hello, Marcia."
- Are you here alone?
"Yes, yes."
I just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.
"Not me, nor you either."
We ain't got time.
"Get dressed, we're going out."
Away!
Away with that audacious lady!
"Antigonus, I charged thee that she should not come about me."
Canst not rule her?
"Good my liege, I me from your good queen."
- Good queen!
"- The good queen, for she is good"
Hath brought you forth a daughter.
- Here 'tis.
- A mankind witch.
"Hen with her out o' door, give her the bastard, thou dotardl"
"Take't up, I say, give't to thy crone."
"He dreads his wife, this brat is none of mine."
"It is yours and so like you, 'tis the worse."
I'll ha' thee burnt!
I care not!
"Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this."
My child?
Away with ill
"Go, take it to the fire."
Beseech your highness
On our knees we beg that you do change this purpose
"Which being so horrible, so bloody, must lead on to some foul issue."
Be it.
Let it live.
What will you adventure to save this brat's life?
- Anything. my lord.
- Mark you perform it.
We enjoin thee that thou carry
This female bastard hen and that thou bear it
To some remote and desert place quite out
Of our dominions and that there thou leave it to its own protection.
Amy Solwey.
- John.
- Thought you were still in prison.
- I got out three months ago.
- How?
Compassionate release.
"I had the transplant, but rejected the kidney."
Guess the state didn't want to pay my hospital bill.
- How did you find me?
- NTCC list says you're next in line.
"- For once, the sicker I am, the better."
- How sick?
End stage renal failure.
"And now, heart damage."
So any day now.
As soon as some perfectly healthy person with my blood type is murdered or has a terrible accident.
Kind of hard to pray for.
Waiting's got to be rough.
Better than the alternative.
You ever think of going on the black mart?
You gonna bust me if I say yes?
People say it's wrong to sell a kidney.
"But then, how come they pay everyone else?"
The transplant team.
The NTCC.
The hospitals.
The people who make the rules aren't dying.
Why did you come here?
"Because you have type-A blood, and we find a guy who died after selling his kidney on the black market."
Also type-A.
I don't need his kidney.
I'm at the top of the transplant list.
I'm proud to say that we've grown yet again.
We have three new guests.
"For the new ones, first off a few words..."
"This is a hotel, but at the same time we offer a lot of space... a lot of free space."
Kind of a community...
Sort of an organism.
A place where everyone can come and contribute with their life experience  above all this is a place that doesn't obey the rules of the market nor that of greed.
Our first guest is Emilia.
Well I'm a photographer  and I like to sing.
Then tell us what you like to sing.
German songs  chansons  opera  everything.
I also like to sing Schubert.
What else should I say about myself?
I have a tumor the size of an egg.
Right in here  and sometimes it gives me a headache.
"Yes well, I like to sing."
We know each other from before.
Emilia was in the hospital a long time as well.
Too long.
And... she's a good writer!
Thank you.
"Yes, I'm Josephine Reiter and I want to make something about Franz  and your community."
That's why there's a camera.
- A film!
About you Franz!
- For television.
Let her continue!
I thought it would be helpful if something about you was shown.
Does anyone need help here?
I don't need any help.
I don't either.
I don't need anyone.
He wears a wire.
I think it's really unprofessional of you to come to a counseling session high.
Don't go.
Please.
I can't trust you anymore.
I guess I'd say that.
Is this your mom's?
The best thing to do when your mom's a drug dealer is to just pretend it's not happening.
"The first time I did this, I was 16, with my mother."
"Your mother didn't die of cancer, did she?"
I really thought I knew you.
"Sid Thomas-Haye, gunshot wound to the upper thigh."
Did you have anything to do with that guy's disappearance?
Yes.
I'll take him from here.
"Come on, Grady."
It's too late.
"- Oh, God."
- Ugh!
Poor Sid.
"We are going to get caught, and I cannot get caught."
"Remember yesterday, when I told you to leave me and my family alone?"
I meant it.
I want answers about my son.
"What he needed was someone to say, ""Keep fighting."""
"Instead, he found someone that said, ""You can give up."""
"Well, look who it is, the Angel of Death."
I want a new partner.
Do you think our past dictates our future?
"Everything that's happened in our lives has brought us to this moment here, you asking me to help you kill people."
"That would be the past dictating the present, and no, I think we have more control than that."
How much do people pay?
"I was like, ""I don't know."
"We're probably gonna want water in ten years."""
"I want to live for today like everybody else, but I gotta live for tomorrow a little bit."
You know what I mean?
Look down the road.
"Look down the Fury Road, you guys."
Did anybody see that documentary?
Anybody see that?
"""I thought it was a film."" Did you?"
"""O.J. hated water."
"He hated water."""
"We'd go out, and I'd be like, ""O.J."
"Need some water."""
I will say this.
I don't do impressions 'cause I'm shitty at 'em.
"But I promise you, this one is pretty close."
It's pretty close.
"When you finally watch that documentary, you're, ""Oh, my God."
It's a shame that guy killed himself.
"He could have made money doing voices."""
You know what?
O.J.
I don't like how some people react when glass breaks.
Have you seen these people?
What if this was my whole show?
"""Have you guys seen these people?"""
"Glass breaks, they're like, ""Nobody touch it!"""
Shut the fuck up.
This is nobody's first broken glass rodeo.
"Nobody's running over like, ""Here, let me scoop up a lot of the shards with my bare forearms."
Put all the pieces in my mouth till I find a trash can at some point.
"No, put the shards of glass into my mouth."""
"On the first day of each month, we always did that."
"I've come this far, at least give me some porridge."
You really don't know the etiquette?
Where did your mother go?
"All right, I will find food to eat by myself."
I'm very hungry.
Is there ramen?
What are you doing?
Why are you looking through others belongings?
It's here.
Do you want to eat as well?
Shall I cook for two?
Looks delicious.
This kimchi is like art work!
Don't spill it.
That way the tablecloth must be replaced.
You should have thrown it away earlier.
It's already become like this.
Just buy a new one.
This tablecloth is the only one in the world.
My mother sewed the table cloth to fit the table my father made.
Then ask her to sew another one.
Is collecting red stickers your hobby?
"Here, there, almost everywhere."
Why did you tear it down?
"That... you really don't know, so that's why you ask me?"
"If I knew, why would I ask you?"
You should also know that my dad... has been in the hospital for ten years.
"My mom was there as well, and died because of the accident."
The bank said they would take household appliances.
That's why they stuck it there.
But now I have a job to pay off the debt.
- Thank you... for letting me sleep the night in jail.
"It was the most vile, most inhuman night of my life."
"Well, coming from the guy who married Julie Cooper, that's saying something."
"So, aside from coming up with your hilarious one-liners, what's our next move?"
My next move is to meet with the partners.
Make sure they agree to my taking you on as a client.
- Why wouldn't they?
- You're not exactly the ideal client.
"- What... rich, powerful?"
- Guilty.
- You missed the turn.
- I'm not taking you to the office.
Kirsten is meeting us at the house.
- I have a business to run.
- Who are you kidding?
"We both know, with the exception of the underhanded stuff, Kirsten does everything anyway."
Step down.
Put Kirsten in charge.
That's your next move.
Excuse me.
"- I'm new, um... is it all right to park here?"
"- Sure, if you're not embarrassed."
"- Ryan, what would you like?"
- You buying?
"No, but I'm letting you order first."
"I may be selfless, but I'm still pretty stingy."
"- Well, in that case,uh, let's see."
"Can I have a... what, what do you got?"
- Large coffee.
I just didn't want to keep him waiting.
That'd be selfish.
"Iced coffee for me,please."
You risk everything if you don't act now.
If you want the vatican's righteous support
"For anything you do, for the rest of your life,"
You will claim England now.
"If you want France as an ally,"
You will claim England now.
"If you want to take England, you will need"
The next king of France by your side.
And you will wed
One of my sons tonight.
I will take my life in my own hands.
And I will not be bullied by you.
"Lady kenna requests a visit, your majesty."
No.
She requests that I inform you that she's naked under her robe.
Send her in.
It's nice to see you're still on your feet.
What does that mean?
I watched you
"Take it lying down for weeks now,"
From all the women in your life.
You don't like being bossed around
"By a girl, do you?"
Is this meant to arouse?
I was wrong to blame and demand things of you.
"I should have blamed you, absolutely."
I also should have offered you more of what you'd like
For what I'd like.
You're offering me sex for a husband?
I could get sex anywhere.
Not from me.
How little it would take for you
It is possible.
A lot that would need to change for that to happen.
Are we still going to Ike's for Thanksgiving?
What are we bringing?
Really?
Yeah.
You know what?
Why don't you stay at your own apartment tonight?
"My apartment is sad and has improper heating, which you know because we're standing in it right now."
So you don't want to be trapped by academia.
There are some people over there who I wish I could still call my colleagues.
They didn't want this life for themselves.
I told this to our boy here.
"You know, you have to be very careful."
Don't believe too strongly the structures they put in front of you.
This is good advice.
"For you more so than him, though."
Excuse me.
(WHISTLES QUIETLY)
You seem ill equipped to deal with someone like that.
We began by hating one another.
I think we're coming back down the other side now.
That's a very potent image.
You should write it down and use it.
"I came up with it on the silent, excruciating drive over here."
I'm glad you approve.
"Oh, I do, indeed."
I should go check on her.
Excuse me.
I think you're being rude to Ike.
I'm glad his feelings are so important.
I think I need to leave.
"No, it's not possible."
George is gonna kill me and so is Jim Jarmusch.
"Well, they can't both kill you."
Just call the dad and ask for it.
He will shoot me.
She's only 16 years old...
"Well, nearly 17."
Nearly 17.
"- You didn't sodomize her, did you?"
- No.
That's too bad.
You gotta be careful.
A lot of things fall under sodomy.
I wonder if kissing is sodomy.
Don't say that.
I need to get this screenplay.
I'm supposed to call Jarmusch and tell him what I think.
Ignore it.
Don't answer your phone.
That's what I would do.
But I don't want it to blow over.
I want this.
I can't work on my novel.
I need this job.
You let me know.
"Because what happened to me was, talking to you before, kind of stirred me up a little bit."
"Yeah, it did."
"And I realised that, you know, my opinions aren't generally taken into consideration."
"That's because in my line of activity, the attributes of loyalty are so much more important than your attributes of opinions."
"Cos, a bodyguard..."
What does a bodyguard do?
"He's gotta stay close to his subject at all times, all the time, and you're wondering what am I doing here right now, right?"
But rather than boring you with my résumé...
I'd rather answer your questions on specific issues of foreign policy.
"I suppose I could ask you, Mr. Crenshaw, how you'd feel in the same situation."
Why would I answer that for you?
Sorry.
It's simply a privacy issue.
"Look, I won't address issues of sexuality in a hearing room... or on national television or anywhere else for that matter."
- Where's the control room for America Live?
I'm so proud of you.
I've been boasting to the forest fairies I'm marrying a devil who works and they're so envious they stopped talking to me.
"If you wanna get married, find somebody else."
I'm too busy for such tomfoolery.
Who?
There's no other young spook around!
"That one, that one at the mansion, marry the Duke, he's a fine spook."
The one from Netolice?
"No, wait..."
"Jean, bring me a window, I want to look in the garden."
Now you know?
"Come quickly, sit down."
Now watch!
"There we are, your Grace."
A fine red wine.
Delicious.
I can't see!
The mirror!
It's gone!
But there's plenty more where that came from.
Jean.
You licked off the cream!
"Your Grace, how can you..."
This is yummy.
I didn't see you.
"You know, an interesting thing happened to me yesterday."
I found a Syrian spy at a restaurant in downtown Miami.
Wow.
"That must be some catch, huh?"
"Actually, it was more like a consolation prize."
I had heard somewhere that your son might be there.
Really?
Well...guess you can't believe everything you hear.
"Let's stop pretending, shall we?"
Next time you see your son -- and we both know there will be a next time -- you tell him I'm coming for him.
"And if you keep helping him, I'm coming for you, too."
So...
How soon can we leave?
"Well, that depends."
"Schmidt, if you can't do this --"
"I can do it, all right?"
Of course I can do it.
But the terms of the arrangement may have changed.
No.
The deal was we get rid of Jabbar in exchange for an all-expenses-paid trip to wherever we want to go.
Your words.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was before I knew that your plan involved
Jabbar stealing everything I have left.
So you guys may have to foot some of the bill.
How much?
Depends on where you want to go.
Depends on how many of you want to go.
"I mean, I-I-I-it's you two, uh, it's black George Clooney, guy with the chin..."
Right -- the four of us.
That is one thing that has gone right today.
"My name is Michael, and I'm here to help you."
"- Everything all right in there, Michael?"
- What is she doing?
She'll wait for us to make a move and pick us off when we do.
I need a screwdriver.
Shouldn't we call the park rangers?
"Unless the park rangers have been issued body armor... and high-caliber weapons, we're on our own here."
She must have disabled my gun when we stopped for gas.
Remove the trigger bar spring from a SIG Sauer P228... and you've got a nine-millimeter semiautomatic doorstop.
"I don't know what you think you're playing at, but this is not a game you can win."
"Doug, I need a paper clip."
Got one?
I don't have a paper clip.
"Well, do you have something like a paper clip,a thin piece of metal-"
Wait.
Never mind.
Kill him yourself if you want.
- We need to wrap this thing up.
- Oh.
Fiona.
- You fix it?
- Hardly.
I might get one shot off.
- You got one chance to shoot her?
- I'm not gonna shoot her.
- Wait.
- Is she leaving?
I seriously doubt that.
You have any duct tape?
Hold that there.
"When I say ""now,"" you're gonna open that door."
And you always wear the most beautiful vintage dresses that remind me of my abuelita.
"And I have a girlfriend, but if I didn't, I would want to sleep with you."
Thank you.
"How you doing, Pop?"
Doing all right in there?
I don't know.
"Obviously not doing too good, I guess."
"Oh, I brought the racing form."
I thought you might like to know the results from Arlington.
"Um, so tit-for-tat won in the sixth."
I'm skipping the early races 'cause you said that those were all for the amateurs.
"Nothing but nags running, right, Dad?"
Painted lady took the seventh.
"Won 24 bucks, that's sweet."
I got to think that you would've put some money on her 'cause you always liked the ladies.
Hungry heart only paid out 4 bucks in the eighth.
Probably 'cause it's a favorite.
"Who bets on a favorite, huh?"
What fun is that?
"Uh, that's all I got."
I'll bring more results tomorrow.
There's a big stakes race.
I figure you'd have blown a shitload of money on that.
I don't know what else to say.
Kinda weird talking to someone if you don't even know if they can even hear you.
You know?
"I'm just gonna sit here for a bit, and I don't think I'm probably gonna say anything at all, cool?"
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I didn't mean to intrude.
I'll come back in a bit.
Thanks.
"Decaf, right?"
"Yes, we loved each other so much, do you know why we split up?"
"No need to know reason for split up, there's good feeling in what you said now."
Let it continue.
You must hear why we split up.
Leave it.
"No, please listen to me."
"After hearing whatever you said,"
"I don't know if it's true or false,"
"I liked your character in it, I love you."
He gave a reverse twist.
"You were right sir, a Chennai jeweller made two such pieces, records show it was sold to two people."
Who are they?
What are their details?
"One buyer was our DGP, another buyer was a girl."
Shop has a photo of hers.
Girl?
They don't have other details but have a delivery address.
Go there immediately and find who is she.
He hasn't called even once after going there.
Can't he work here?
Why does he have to go to Malaysia?
"You always criticized when he leftjobs, now he's working sincerely, let him do it."
Is Swathi at home?
Swathi?
Nobody lives here with that name.
This girl.
Who is she?
They give this address only.
"We are living here for the past 7 years, not only here, I've not seen her in this area also."
Why did you say you don't know her?
She rejected my son.
She had promised to be with him always.
"Since I'm going to church again, it's the same church that sponsors the nursery where you work, it's just..."
"It's really difficult to make friends because people are totally prejudiced against Christians, so I just thought maybe we could be friends."
But we're already friends.
"Great, let's hang out, let's do something tonight."
"Grace, I have a baby."
I have John.
"And by the time the church nursery closes and I get him home and I bathe him and feed him and put him to bed and do my homework, it's, like, 11:00 and I have a husband, so..."
I don't really have time to hang out with you or with any of my other friends.
What if I came over and I help you with John and we did our homework together?
And that would free you up for more friend time.
"Well, it's just that Ricky is in the apartment trying to study at the same time."
"Then I'll bring Jack, too."
"I mean, maybe the four of us can be friends."
"Thanks, Amy."
That's a great idea.
(DIALING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
"Hey, what's up?"
Everything okay?
Grace wants to come over with Jack tonight.
For what?
"Just to hang out, be friends."
What?
My dad and Grace's mom want Grace and me to be friends.
What does that have to do with Jack and me?
"Well, Jack is Grace's boyfriend and you're my husband, so..."
So what?
"So, got roped into doing this tonight and I'd like you to go along with it."
"Hey, Ricky!"
Are you coming in for a coffee?
"Yeah, I'll be right there."
Okay.
"If you're helping him in any way, that constitutes a federal crime."
"I'm aware, and I'd like to help you, Ms. Riley."
Anything I can do to get my son through this alive.
"I, uh, wonder if, um, I could ask a favor of you."
I'd like you to sign this.
It affirms that you'll be cooperating fully with our investigation.
"And if you violate this agreement in any way, you're looking at life in prison."
Do you have a pen?
Thank you.
There you go.
Thank you.
"Well, that's all I need for today."
"And, uh, please -- do call if you hear anything."
Excuse me.
Who are they?
Oh.
Don't mind them.
They're just checking to see if your phone lines are working properly.
"For your protection, of course."
Of course.
Oh.
"We checked the inside of the house, as well."
Just making sure there's no place for anyone to hide.
"Thanks for your time, Mrs. Westen."
"No, no, thank you."
Bitch.
How long is it gonna take for Jabbar's guys to get here?
I-I just -
- I don't understand why I have to be here.
"I mean, can't -- well, what if I wait outside --"
"I already explained this, okay?"
Jabbar's guys need to think that they caught you by surprise while you were working Mike over.
They said your father could be released.
"We compared out destinies, like young girls comparing dresses."
Now she was going to be reunited with a saint.
"A martyr, beautiful... noble."
"Her gift was living, and she got theater instead."
My gift was theater.
Instead I got snarled up in life...
So it goes.
She went back.
She died of love.
I waited here for a visa that's never issued to dissidents' sister-in-laws.
And I became as bad at acting as I am in life.
"""It's like the sky in the country""."
"It's the Atlantic, the wind from the ocean."
You know we have seagulls here in Paris?
"That's what I'm doing at the moment, The Seagull."
"Well, the play."
My daughter plays the lead.
"Nowadays, after two cheap porno films, you can even become a member of the Academy."
She arranged for me to have a part in the play.
Do you know it?
Not really.
Sea birds don't fly to Hungary.
And what kind of bird are you?
What do you do in Hungary?
I was told to work with my hands.
My head still hurts.
A bird of different feather.
"I'm sorry, you make me feel uneasy."
Nestor?
To the theater!
"The bird touches down on the mud, leaves his mark, more beautiful than his flight, than his life."
How else did I know which hotel you'd be in?
Which amoeba scratching his crutch not a million miles away might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world and tell Lenny you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them, Calum?"
You miserable little snitch.
I got used to having your big cheery smile around.
- Didn't want to see you leave.
- What do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning
- I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"As long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So can you can get us into the house?
I might just be up to it.
Sweet.
Ooh!
That's the front door.
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow, OK?"
"Oh, I'm awfully sorry to disturb you."
- That's all right.
- I've broken down just along the road and wouldn't you know it but the bloody mobile...!
Would you mind if I borrowed your phone to call the AA?
Erm...
You'll have to tell me where I am.
- Of course.
Come inside.
- Thank you.
You're an absolute angel.
"Say, uh, hey, Billy, look up there."
See that building up there?
That's where your mother and I went to high school.
"[woman] Do you see it, Billy?"
"Remember, I told you those stories?"
Yeah.
"Hey, well my dad's a professor at Princeton."
"Oh, yeah, great."
"Well, he's not exactly a full professor."
"[woman] Anyway, I really wanted to go to New york."
"And then after I was there a while,"
"I don't know, I kind of wanted to come home again."
"Even when I went to New York to visit you, I missed it."
"It's not that I didn't have a good time, but, uh, this is really home."
[woman] I know exactly what you mean.
"Like, do you remem-- well, you probably don't remember when I won that silly contest, Miss, um-- oh, what was the-- miss Orange Blossom?"
"Yeah, um, Orange Growers Association."
How did you remember the name of that contest?
"Listen, I took your picture for the paper, remember?"
"As a matter of fact, that's when I started to fall in love with you."
"You look terrific, Billy."
"Yeah, a real cowboy."
"Right, mom?"
"Very funny, get in the car."
You're hard to please.
"Try to be nice to him, Billy."
"Okay, I'll try."
That's my pal.
Here you go.
"We're going into gold mine country, full of claim jumpers."
You're going to need that.
"That's the same kind of gun that William H. Bonney, better known as Billy the Kid, used in 1875 when he shot it out with the James Boys."
"Apparently, you can't say he's got a vagina."
Ohh!
"Fine, I'll just take the whole thing out."
"Hey, you've got to tell that NBC page to take it down a notch."
"Who, Kenneth?"
He just embarrassed me in front of a whole tour group.
I'll talk to him.
What is this?
"Well, you know how I hate it when people cheat or break rules?"
"Yes, I do."
"Well, I just spent 150 bucks on wieners."
Attaboy.
"Chumley, the beverage situation around here is reprehensible."
"Oh, good morning, sunshine."
"Surely, our massive conglomerate parent company could spring for a samovar of coffee."
"Yeah, or, like, a big coffee dispenser."
That's what a samovar is.
"Are there other black nerds, or is it just you and Urkel?"
"Uh, Cerie, do you want to go get some coffee?"
"No, thank you."
No?
"Hey, Josh, I need to change your Michael Jackson thing."
Didn't you tell me you had a Jay Leno impression?
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out."
"[High-pitched voice] So, President Bush is in the news again."
"No, Jay Leno."
"The host of ""The Tonight Show."""
[Normal voice] That's what I was doing.
"[High-pitched voice] So, my wife Mavis and I like to go shopping for old cars, you know?"
"No, no, like Jay Leno."
"[High-pitched voice] Like, ""Hey, here are the headlines."""
[High-pitched voice] Have you ever noticed when you eat a lot of cheese...
- That's the husband.
Get Psych down here.
- Can my wife go home now?
- Not yet.
"What, you moved Judy out of the trauma room."
I thought that meant she was good to go.
We needed to clear the room.
"We have to rule out a cardiac contusion, so we need to monitor her heart some more to make sure it's not bruised."
For how long?
I'm not sure.
It could be a while.
Mr. Anderson... does Judy drink alcohol?
No.
"I mean, she has a glass of wine now and then."
Why?
What about drugs?
What's this all about?
"Just routine questions for her chart to avoid any drug interaction, that sort of thing."
Have you noticed any change in her mood lately?
Like what?
She seem depressed?
Any loss of appetite or trouble sleeping?
"You're kidding, right?"
We have a three- month-old baby.
"When Gracie doesn't sleep, none of us do."
"Look, the sooner I can get them both home, the sooner they can start getting better."
I don't want to send her home until I'm sure there's no danger.
"No, of course, you're right."
Thank you.
"Dr. Kovac, could you help me clear some beds?"
I thought I was.
"Well, maybe if we work together."
"Now, you might be a couple of pounds overweight... but at least... we know where it is."
Are you..
Are you saying I'm fat?
Fat?
No.
Let's just say you're a little short for your weight.
"I mean, I think you're in pretty good shape for a 49-year-old man."
I'm 41.
"Bob, your chart says... 49."
"Well, I'm definitely 41, at least I will be this Thursday."
Then why does your chart say 49?
"Oh, That's a one."
My ones look like nines.
"Listen, Bob."
Now that I know you're eight years younger... you're also about eight pounds too heavy.
"Now I don't want to frighten you, but it's just possible... that every pound overweight could mean a year off your life."
"Well, it doesn't frighten me because..."
I hadn't made any special plans for those last eight years anyway.
"Oh, good."
"Miss Burke, get Dr. Hartley a copy of that-"
- High-protein diet?
- High-protein diet.
"Here you go, Dr. Hartley."
"Bob, you are gonna like this diet."
"It's sensible, easy to follow, and you don't have to turn anything purple."
Good.
As long as it's easy to follow.
Now look.
Get yourself a good medical scale.
Weigh yourself twice a day and keep a chart of it.
Carry this counter wherever you go.
Keep track of your daily intake of cholesterol and fats.
- Why?
"Oh, I don't know."
I-
I've had sort of a strange premonition.
"I don't know exactly how to explain it, but-"
"Explanations belong 5,000 miles away."
I only have one question... and I only want one answer.
You know the answer.
I don't want to know the answer.
I want to have the answer.
"It just struck me, Mr. Blake."
"Now my back please, Kali."
"I say, Mr. Blake, it's just struck me that so far..."
I've taken this entire matter on trust.
I believed your story and put up the money for this outfit.
"I still believe your story, but I think it's time... you gave me a little more positive proof."
"You should show us the map, Mr. Blake."
When I asked you in Dawson City to help finance me...
I told you I knew the location of a very rich mine.
I still know where that mine is.
I'm taking you there.
"But the map, Mr. Blake-"
Why do you continually refuse to show us the map?
I see.
"Well, what's to prevent our taking it away from you?"
The possibility that such a map may not exist- except in my memory.
Violence will do you no good.
You've come this far... and now there's nothing you can do but go all the way.
You'll gain nothing... by killing me.
"Now, now."
Who talked of killing?
"We're not pirates, my dear man."
"Slade, you dragged me into this, yeah?"
And I want things done properly.
This girl has been attacked.
And that to me requires the police.
"Listen, if we call the police then we lose that trust."
And if we lose that trust then we have nothing.
"No police, no."
So what are you gonna about it ?
How did the meeting with Marosi go?
"Yeah, it was wonderful."
"Listen mate, can you get into work?"
I'm still here.
Why ?
OK good.
So I'm gonna send you a photo of a girl.
Have you had a girl reported missing recently looks who like this ?
She's got a really distinctive birth mark below her eye.
What's this about ?
"- I can't tell you that yet, mate."
- Let me just get this straight.
So I'm in the middle of a murder investigation and I'm dead on my feet.
"And you want me to talk to Missing Persons and God knows what, risking my career for God knows why."
And you expect me to do this just because we're friends?
"Yep, pretty much mate, yeah-"
I'll call you if I find anything.
"Hey, any luck tracing the dead woman through the phone networks?"
"Nada, zip, nichts."
"Yeah, a simple ""no"" is fine."
No.
"Is there any news, mate?"
"Yeah, her name is Gemma Morgan."
She's officially a missing person.
What?
!
Fleming:
Thank you for that.
I take it you didn't find anything.
"No sign of it, I'm afraid."
"But she might, of course, have panicked and got rid of it."
"Well, I doubt it."
"It's too valuable, and taking the letter in the first place was too much of a risk."
"I'm surprised Spencer hasn't, um-- let's go in here--hasn't mentioned it to you."
"He still trusts you, doesn't he?"
"Well, he's told me he's got it."
He's just not saying what he's done with it.
He likes to play these things close to his chest.
"Well, it's certainly not in the hotel."
We'll just have to keep looking.
"So, what about the shooting?"
You think Margaret Ellis was the target?
Do you?
"Well, there was nobody in the room who had any reason to kill her..."
"Except Arthur Ellis, perhaps."
He didn't have it in him.
The son?
Perhaps.
He could have opened the door.
But how would he have been able to see to take aim?
"I'll tell you one thing, though."
I happen to know for a fact that Mrs. Ellis changed her will hours before she died.
"She added a codicil leaving half her money, and that includes half the hotel, to the Friday club."
All for the cause.
"Spencer persuaded her, do you think?"
He's good at that sort of thing.
"If you don't run, you spoil our fun!"
"I offer up this contract, to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps in the atmosphere!"
Is he using that magic to accelerate?
"I offer up this contract, to bear the spirit beast of light which sleeps in the atmosphere!"
Are you okay?
"Yes, but you... that magic..."
You should know it.
"I didn't want to use it, though."
Damn it.
So that was...
You!
Why do you use our magic?
He couldn't be!
An Alpha Stigma bearer?
The eyes said to bring forth disaster!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash..."
Stop!
Don't use magic!
"I offer up this contract, to unleash the magic beast which dances through the skies!"
"If you'd used that power sooner, everyone might not be dead right now!"
"We only faced three of them, so we made it out alive."
"Besides, it's been seven years since I've used this power..."
You gave us an interesting spectacle there.
"How rare to see an Alpha Stigma, monster."
Cower more!
"Amuse me, monster."
"You have an Alpha Stigma, right?"
Show me something nice.
"Do you get it yet, monster?"
Those two are the only ones left.
We killed the rest.
All of them.
This is not how the Nazis started!
Exactly like this.
Honkytonk Man!
It's...
Don't keep saying it - we heard you the first time.
It's a genuine film.
"I expect a text from you tomorrow, from all of you, in fact, just going,"
"""I'm sorry."
"I got home, I looked it up."
It's a really good film
"""and it was very sad at the end."
"He coughs up blood."""
I don't think it was probably released here.
It was!
"I don't want to start a beef with Brian May, and that's a sentence I've never said before, but the badger is Ireland's most dangerous wild animal in terms of attacks."
I am listening.
I'm just looking up Honkytonk Man.
"Oh, come off it!"
You'd have to go out of your way to find the badger and then poke it with something.
"OK, this is what I've heard."
"There's a time of year when the badger mates and during that time, if you walk onto their turf, then they will come..."
Turf?
"Yeah, they will..."
Literally.
Badgers in Harlem.
That was a good film.
"Now, that one I saw."
Clint was brilliant in that.
So the badger has a locked jaw.
"If you're walking through the woods and...so the badger, ""Oi oi!"
"This could be a mate rival!"""
So the badger comes and attacks you because it thinks you're going to shag the other badger?
Jesus... can I just have a few minutes?
We wanna know who you are.
"We'll find out, you know."
Sooner or later.
You could save us some legwork by communicating with us now.
Are you a Satanist?
You in some kind of cult?
"Coz if there are others involved, we'll find them too, believe me."
What's the matter?
Is that it?
Is there someone you wanna tell me about?
I'm sorry.
The Nurse at reception downstairs is on the phone.
She wants to talk to you.
Says it's urgent.
I'm coming
I'll be right back.
yeah
His daughter?
When was this -- is she still here...?
"did she leave any information, a phone number...?"
What do you mean a little girl?
How little...?
"Jesus, Mary, and Joseph..."
"There is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might."
"Our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal."
The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past...
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
"Eat some now, save some for later..."
Now and Later... the really tasty treat...
Now and Later... the flavor can't be beat..
Look at all those pieces
"You mean, tricycles don't really fall out of her arms?"
"Uh, no."
Oh my god!
Of course they don't!
"I mean, just think how flabby her arms would have to be for a tricycle to be up in there, and for so many years."
"And she didn't even notice it, not even when she took a shower."
That's hysterical.
I get it.
I get the joke!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
This should be fun.
"Um, I'd like to welcome you all here tonight."
"Before we go any further,"
"I think that we should all acknowledge the sensational job, that my esteemed colleague, Dr. Mary Albright has done in organizing this truly worthwhile event."
Dr. Albright.
Don't you love Dr. Albright?
I know I do.
"Now, I know many of you are wondering, what's with her long sleeves?"
"Well, I'll tell you."
It's to cover up her flabby arms.
"She shook them the other day, and the dead sea scrolls fell out."
"She's, uh.. she's quite old also, you see."
"But you know, as sweet and wonderful, as Dr. Albright is, she can also be somewhat domineering, power-hungry and hostile, and I think I finally figured out why."
"Dr. Albright, while you may not have a man's genitalia, at least you have his razor stubble."
"Oh, oh, oh!"
Oh!
And there's Nina.
Nina is Dr. Albright's assistant.
"Nina, stand up, stand up."
"Come on, stand up."
"Show everybody how you put the ""Ass"""
I can see why you don't do this face to face.
It can be very awkward.
Hi.
And then you'd say...
"""Hi."
"How was your day?"""
"Oh, me?"
"I had a really weird day, actually."
And now I'm here... alone in my apartment.
You're probably in your big house... with your family...
and your dog.
And probably your dog has a family too.
You're probably all gathered around the fire singing carols... even though it isn't Christmas.
Just for fun.
"You will never, ever see this... because you'll never watch this far on the tape."
"You'll probably never even watch the tape, will you?"
I could do anything right now.
"If you are watching this... then just call this number, okay?"
"Just call this number, the number you see on your screen... and say ""macaroni. """
Okay?
That's all you have to do.
"Just ""macaroni""and hang up."
No questions asked.
I thought we'd have breakfast for dinner.
And then maybe sometime we'll have dinner for breakfast.
Just to mix things up a little.
But there's still ice cream for dessert.
It's fine with me if you guys want to continue this silent treatment.
It's like a Zen retreat for me.
- Can I see it?
- I didn't use the book.
I made it up.
"With a bite mark from the victim, I'd fold too."
Here we go.
We don't concede anything at this point.
"My client needs to sleep, gather his thoughts."
We'll talk after the arraignment.
Defendant's ordered to surrender his passport.
Bail is set at $1 million.
Next case.
I hope your client's rested and ready to talk.
Nothing to talk about.
It's amazing what a good night's sleep can do.
I guess the jail house grub made him think twice about getting a plea.
Gloves and a pillbox hat?
Looks like she's going to an afternoon tea.
I'm looking for the elevators.
"Yeah, they're back there."
Mind if we talk to you for a minute?
I don't think Philip's lawyers would want me talking to you.
"Well, did he tell you about the evidence that we have against Mr. Reinhardt?"
The bite on his neck from Laura.
I know about it.
She bit him when he flirted with her in the wardrobe racks.
- He told you this?
- Laura did.
The last time she came to my dressing room.
And why didn't you tell us that?
"At the time, it wasn't important."
Your part-time boyfriend hits on your daughter.
You don't think that's important?
Philip is harmless.
I told Laura she should be flattered.
"And now, if you would excuse me,"
He lives above his head a little.
I am reminded of Louis the Whatever's finance minister:
De-something.
He built this chateau.
Nicole and I saw it when we went to Paris.
"It even outshone Versailles, where the king lived."
"In the end, Louis clapped him in irons."
"Look, Tony."
"All I can promise you is, I will look into it."
"I understand you got to try to feel out your old man so he don't give you 'a mazz'.... you know, for sticking your nose in."
I haven't been afraid of my father for quite some time.
Fair enough.
"But, Carmine, bear in mind, he came onto my turf."
He tried to recruit my mulignon.
"And worse, he roughed up my appraiser."
If the proper response is not forthcoming in a business-like time frame... my next move will not be further conversation.
I get it.
You should know that my next call will be to Johnny Sack... to let him know that we talked.
He shouldn't feel blind-sided.
Hello?
I'm here for the masoner job.
Me no speak the English.
Mi dispiace.
-There ain't no bear back there.
-Fellas!
"Well, the way I feel right now, I'd like to meet a bear."
What would you do if you did meet him?
That bear would have just as much chance as this pork chop.
Where you boys all going?
It ain't over.
Somebody's going to get something they ain't expecting.
"If we're the only beings that are conscious of this universe, us looking up and appreciating it is a very good thing, right?"
Are we the only ones?
"If so, yes."
I'm almost certain we're the only ones.
"So if we're not conscious of it, it's meaningless, isn't it?"
Yes.
"If we occasionally look into space and think about it, then the universe will not be lonely."
You're so beautiful.
Thank you.
But I've been repeating this ever since I was very young.
It's just some words of nostalgia.
- Am I being too honest?
- It's alright.
"This may sound simplistic, but the really real thing that I have absolute faith in is the stars."
Stars?
"I don't quite understand, but you must explain it to me later."
Thanks for listening.
- Aren't you cold?
- Cold?
Hold on.
- Yes?
- Where the hell are you?
Are you with Director Kim?
"Yeah, we're taking a walk on the beach."
This late?
"It's so dark, you can't see a thing."
Where are you?
And why did you leave me behind?
We're just taking a walk.
You took so long in the bathroom.
That's why we left without you.
- Come join us.
"And I'm sorry, but I-I can't back out now."
Okay.
So you're just gonna live your life keeping secrets again?
- This isn't like that.
- How is it not like that?
You're keeping this from Harvey.
And Harvey kept things from Jessica.
Look at how that turned out.
"I tell Harvey now, and it's the same as if he catches me."
"The case gets tossed, and all of the people we're trying to help keep getting abused."
It's the same as before.
"No, Rachel, this is not the same as when I was a fraud."
And I'll tell you something else...
"I used to have trouble sleeping at night, but I sleep like a baby now because I am helping these people."
"I'm sorry, but that's the word that I'm keeping."
Good morning.
Hey.
Did you sleep well?
"If you consider eight hours of bliss sleeping well, then, yes, I slept very well."
But now I have to go.
- Wait.
"- Harvey, I have patients."
"I know, but..."
I wanted to get your opinion on something.
What have you done this time?
I haven't told Donna we're seeing each other yet.
Why not?
"Come on, you know my history with her."
We're working together.
I just promoted her.
"That's more an excuse than a reason, isn't it?"
I don't want to create a problem when there isn't one.
Mrs. hall!
Go on to your basket now.
"Oh, I'm disgusted with you."
Go on.
Mrs. hall!
"- I heard you the first time, Mr. farnon."
How did he get out?
I've asked you to keep the gate shut.
"Aye, you have."
- He nearly ended up under the wheels of my car.
"While the hole stays in fence, dogs will stray-- the hole?"
!
- So either you or Mr. Tristan must mend it.
"Till then, you've got nothing you can complain about, have you?"
Tristan...
You almost left it too late.
"Stick that round his neck, would you, please?"
He was running with that bunch at far field.
I had no idea it had gotten to this state.
"Wooden tongue, is it?"
"Yes, that's right-- actinobacillosis, to be absolutely accurate."
"It you don't catch it in time, the tongue hardens, and they starve to death."
"Can you do aught for him, you reckon?"
"Mmm, fortunately."
"There's a new treatment, Mr. Abbot-- sodium iodide."
It's a vast improvement on the old system-- painting the tongue with iodine.
Hello.
What do you want?
"Come to keep an eye on things, haven't you, lass?"
It's vital you get some nourishment into him.
Milk or gruel will do until the injection starts to work.
"If he'll drink it, that'll do him the most good."
Excuse me?
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
I want to know what your intentions are.
Excuse me?
- ln regards to Rick Sammler.
"- Well, I like him as a friend."
Are you capable of being serious?
"Karen, this is a sealed investigation."
You think I could answer a question like that?
We know he had nothing to do with conspiring to suborn judges or anyone.
You know him that well?
I want to know he's not going to be indicted.
That's not up to me.
It's up to 1 6 people who will make that decision.
- Whom you will influence.
- lf they're not prejudiced or idiots.
- Whom you will influence.
"- Karen, I... I don't want to say how much I actually like you, so I won't, but... I'm sorry."
I believe in what I do just as you believe in what you do.
"I swore an oath, which I spent a lot of years upholding, and I cannot stop now, and I wouldn't ask you to, either."
And I would completely understand if you were to walk away with those right now.
"Go home, chief."
"[Amanda] Oh, hi."
How are you?
"Well, you know, he's back there."
"My name is Ozymandias, King of kings."
"Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair."
"I'm sorry, Rick."
Truly sorry.
"And that's a word I don't say very often, believe me."
"What are you sorry for, Miles?"
It took 1 0 days.
I didn't ask questions.
Should I have?
"You know, I was once a boy scout myself."
We brought concrete from Indiana.
I don't remember a sales tax.
"Was there one, or was it made to dematerialize?"
How come the union allowed us to use 50 mechanics when their contract stipulated 1 00 on a job this size?
Why would I know any of this?
Wasn't all this your job?
I didn't make these things happen.
Somebody else did.
I've tried not to ask who.
- So you don't know?
- What are you saying to me?
A lawyer once told me you can't be convicted of perjury for something you didn't say.
What are you talking about perjury?
What is going on?
I have to tell the truth about what I know.
And so you shall.
And that's it?
"You have nothing more to say, nothing to warn me about, nothing to help me to know what to expect?"
"They really could have come up with a more attractive plaza to represent our city, don't you think?"
Rick.
"Where you're standing right now used to be a mountain range, and before that, an ocean."
Keep that in mind.
All things pass away.
[sighs]
- What are you doing here?
"- Hey, Dad."
- You're supposed to be in school.
- l ditched.
"- Yeah, I was in there yesterday."
- You were in there yesterday?
It's the DEA building.
"Yeah, why were you in there?"
"I was by there, yesterday."
I drove by.
I know the building.
Thanks for this.
Rene says the building we followed the guy into is where the DEA has offices.
"So he's working for them, or working with them, or using their facilities."
"- Somehow, he's connected."
- Looks that way.
- How do you know he's DEA?
"- I don't know, that's the point."
"He was seen going into the DEA building, so he's got a relationship of some kind."
"Come on, you've got to help me out."
"All right, I'll look in to it."
"I had a conversation with Dante, planted the idea of him partnering with Phan's crew."
- He's thinking about it.
- Good.
We have another problem.
"We gotta deal with this DEA agent, or whoever he is, who's looking to kidnap Reardon."
We need Reardon here and able to play.
I don't wanna make that call.
Let me see if I can work some back channels.
"I can poke around, see if the DEA cares about this guy, or what his game is."
It's Julianna.
"I am allowed to talk to my lawyer in private, I think."
I am in the immigration jail.
They say I am in violation of my visa and they are asking about working for the escort service.
- Can you help me?
- All right.
"Well, he's coming to work with me, so I guess that's the plan, if that's still the plan."
Up to you.
There are a few things around here that need repairing.
"All right, kids, go get your things for school."
I'll be at the car.
- Michael.
- I call front seat!
Come on!
"My turn, Jared!"
You got it yesterday!
"Now, you're released into my custody until this case is solved, Michael, so if I let you stay, you do understand you can't leave."
"Yeah, of course, I'll do whatever you want."
That's the least I owe you.
"And, listen, I'm, uh,"
I'm sorry again for putting you through this.
"After today, this is all behind us and you can get back to focusing on your repair shop."
You find a space?
Got a few I'm looking at.
"I'm gonna pay you back every dime, you know-- with interest."
And free repairs for life.
"Hey, tell your man Gibbs I'll miss him."
You lay off Special Agent Gibbs.
This hasn't been easy on him either.
"Eh, I don't like the way he looks at me."
He looks at everybody like that.
"Where is he, Leon?"
"According to my morning brief, you recovered a knife from the suspect."
It came back negative;
it's not our weapon.
Then what next?
Could Michael be a flight risk?
He's at my house with his sister.
"In a few seconds, staying conscious won't even be chemically possible."
Mr. Stancati.
I take it you're not a morning person?
Coffee?
No thanks.
That last drink had quite the kick.
Yes.
"Yes, indeed."
"Well, why don't you get dressed and join us outside?"
"Sorry for the, uh, the strip search."
"Trust me, it's nothing personal."
All weapons and recording devices will be returned to you once you leave the island.
"Surely, you'd let a lady have her watch."
"Ah, not when it's housing a G.P.S. Transponder, no."
"Play with me again, and I will have you shot."
You don't know where we are because I don't want you to know.
We have business.
Let's do it.
Time to see the merchandise.
It's about a 5-minute walk.
"Uh, watch out for snakes..."
And each other.
Radar detected a speedboat leaving the ship last night.
"Guys, if bosley's been taken off-board, he could be anywhere."
It's a big ocean out there.
"Charlie, we're hoping you can narrow things down for us."
"Luckily, I can."
I had my contact target the search to a few key nearby islands.
Most of them are owned by the requisite movie stars and corporate titans.
This one is the odd man out.
It belongs to Carlton Finch.
"With a name like that, he's got to be bad news."
There's a couple of odd things about it.
Neither the parka nor the ski mask have any markings on them.
"No way to trace them and they were cut to ribbons, anyway."
"You certainly lock yourself in here, sir."
"And very smart to do it, too."
"Oh, here we go."
"No, that doesn't work either."
You think he mutilated the disguise because he was afraid someone might recognize it?
"Exactly, sir."
"Boy, do you and I think the same way."
It's amazing.
Isn't it?
"I wonder, sir."
"Is there a trick to unlocking this door, sir?"
I can't seem to manage it.
Everybody has trouble with this.
"Thank you very much, sir."
"Oh, did I mention the mask?"
That it was slashed?
No.
That it had makeup on it.
"The lab turned it up, sir."
Where would he find a mask that had makeup on it?
That's a very good question.
I believe you know the answer.
"I believe I do, sir."
We could be looking for a woman.
Precisely.
"We've assumed all along it was a man, but it's possible we were wrong."
Particularly in the light of this.
"Oh, I'm relieved to hear you say that, sir."
I thought you were going to say it was impossible because of Tony.
Must be bypassing the filters.
I must find the filter system.
"That'll cut off the flow, it was coming through the ventilators."
Filters.
See what you can do for those two.
Avon.
Have you found anything?
Take a look.
"He's the fourth one I've found, all of them unconscious."
It's Sonovapour.
Yes.
I know.
We found a couple.
It must be coming from the filters.
"Yes, well that should be this way."
It's over here.
Here it is.
Not a very expert job.
Just stuck the tubing into the primary feed.
"It's effective, though."
Look at the gauge.
The cylinder is almost empty.
"Once it was empty, the filter system would have cycled the gas out of the atmosphere."
At which point everybody would just wake up.
On the face of it a seemingly pointless exercise.
So wake them up and ask them what it's all about.
"Increase the oxygen supply, it will speed recovery."
He's dead.
Very.
Someone was very thorough.
All this damage has jammed the main controls on a circular flight pattern.
Can it be repaired?
"I tell you, I will not fall for you!"
You deserve to be put behind bars.
You deserve to die in jail!
You are too bad!
"I tell you, you jinx!"
Serve you right!
Quiet
"Your Honour,"
I've proved that his motive is doubtful...
"Your Honour, the accused's look doesn't make sense with killing."
"By the way, the..."
Wait!
"You should wait, by the way..."
Listen to me first.
"Even he wanted to kill Chun, he would go some place else."
It's senseless to kill in the place where he is working.
What do you think the cause of Chun's death?
"I don't know, you'd better think!"
"Maybe, Ho Chun wanted to rape Foon."
But he failed.
So he committed suicide and made Foon be the scapegoat.
"Chan Mon-gut, this is the British court, not the poor court of you Chinese."
I don't know what you are doing here.
You don't know anything about law.
Please go back to study more.
"Even you don't think of your own reputation, you'd think of the face of your fellow people."
Sorry...
He always mentions the United Kingdom.
It seems he's forgotten that Hong Kong was leased to the UK.
They have to return it one day!
"Damn it, how dare he be that cocky in our territory!"
?
- Hey.
"- Hey, Madam Senator."
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.
I wish you'd heard the speech.
That line you gave me about...
"""If we can put a man on the moon, then why can't we put all men on the moon?"""
It was perfect.
It really broke the ice.
"- Great audience for that, huh?"
"- Yeah, it was great."
What's goin' on?
"Uh... well, it looks like Runyon or somebody close to him... has been running a little private investigation... looking for stuff that the Feds wouldn't even touch."
"- It's, um..."
- Yeah?
What is it?
What...
- He doesn't know anything about it.
- You're asking me to step down?
I'm asking you to do what's in the best interest of the party... and this president.
"Well, I'm sorry."
"I can't do it, not over this."
He's not going to allow me or himself... to get shot down over what would've been a private sexual encounter.
"- Some swan song for the old man, huh?"
- It's fuckin' awful.
The senator got a little wild when she was 19.
What is the big deal?
Let me explain the big deal to you.
The people of this nation can stomach quite a bit.
But one thing they can't stomach is the image of a vice president with a mouthful of cock.
You don't have to use...
Look.
"- Oh, thank you, Dr. Jekyll."
- Thank you.
"- Good night, Mrs. Higgins."
"Good night, doctor."
Good night.
"- Hello, Dr. Jekyll."
How are you?
"- Good evening, Mr. Weller."
"Just in time, sir."
Just locking up.
Wait half a moment until I fix this thing over here I'll walk up to the east gate with you.
"Wonderful nights we're having, sir."
"And don't you believe about this here comet and the ""world coming to an end"" business."
"If you ask me, it don't amount to a row of beans."
"Newspaper talk, that's what I calls it."
Don't you believe it.
Step down to Lloyd's and take out an insurance policy and it won't cost you more than it did last week when there was no talk of a comet or the world running into one.
"Those fellows know what they're talking about, sir."
You take that from me.
"Mr. Weller, here's a point."
"If you had a balloon that carried a man to Mars and the pilot you picked suddenly disappeared, would you get in the balloon yourself and cast off?"
A balloon?
"Well, that's a good one, sir."
I think you got me there.
I don't know though.
"If I had a balloon that would take me there and back, mind you, I don't know that I wouldn't have a go at it."
Might get me away from me mother-in-law for a while.
"How's that for an answer, Dr. Jekyll?"
"Fair enough, Mr. Weller."
Fair enough.
Yes?
What?
You still itching for more?
Some guys never learn.
Here's some ice off the roof.
"Beat it, you little stooge."
"Go on, tell the crumb where he stands."
I called a meeting of the barracks chiefs this morning.
I thought I could get you transferred into another barracks.
But it turns out that nobody likes you any more than we do.
"So you're stuck with me, huh?"
Maybe the Russian broads would take him.
"Not with that kisser, not anymore."
"You got off lucky last night, Sefton."
One more move and you'll wake up with your throat cut.
"You listening, Sefton?"
"Yeah, I still got one good ear."
"Now, you listen to me."
There are two guys in this barracks that know I didn't do it.
Me and the guy that did do it.
And it could be any one of you.
"You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price or the Animal, or Blondie, or even Joey."
"And he'd better watch out, the guy that left me holding the stick."
If there's gonna be any throats cut in this barrack--
"Out, out!"
Everybody at attention for the Geneva man!
"As you were, gentlemen."
Please.
Here we have a typical barrack.
It houses 75 men.
"Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally."
Naturally.
It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
"As for the blankets, you will notice they're very warm."
One second!
What are you doing here?
"We're tutoring them, it's all completely legal!"
Where... did the previous tenants go?
I came here two weeks ago.
And I don't know the previous tenants.
"Oh, Tae Ho!"
Why are you coming out of that room?
Did you get them mixed up?
What are you talking about?
That room was just storage space for our equipment.
Since we had a lot of communications equipment...
"And because the rent was so expensive we sent the equipment to the head office, and let the room go up for rent."
How does that make any sense?
"There were two men, and this woman, both of whom you work with, in that room!"
The two men!
Where are they?
We didn't come here to play.
We are here because of a murder!
And I know you ordered them to do all of this!
You?
So this is how you're going to be?
- Jung In!
- Yes?
Have you ever been to room 866?
No.
"See, Tae Ho?"
What reason would we have to hire two more male employees?
When all we have to do is gather the agents whenever they showed up!
I know your job is to trick people.
"But try to do it in moderation, okay?"
"I'm telling you that I saw them, very clearly, with my own eyes."
"As soon as he got pinched, he ratted everybody out."
I know where he is.
He's hiding out.
Know what I'm sayin'?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
"No, not at all."
"That way they got nothing, uh?"
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go down to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
"Wherever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again I don't wanna go any place that's cold."
You don't have a choice.
"Ed, come on."
Whoever fucking controls it just no place cold.
Do that for me.
"He's bronchial, that's why."
If he's legitimately bronchial we may take that into consideration.
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
"You mean to tell me if something happens to my parents and they get sick, I can't see them?"
Maybe something could be worked out if they're sick.
"If there's extraordinary circumstances-- l can't do this. I can't do this, Henry."
I can't leave my parents.
"Karen, I told you before."

What the hell's the difference?
"The difference is it's a good case, and somebody else can still take it."

"Harvey, if this is about earlier today,"
I want to thank you for backing me.
"It is about earlier today, Alex, but I'm not here for you to thank me."
What are you talking about?
"I got to thinking about what Mike said, and he was right."
"You could've done what you did quietly, but you didn't."
Harvey...
Do you have a nice place to write?
"I mean, that's important."
"You'll find that, if you haven't already."

You can trust me on this.
I'm not sorry if this kills any of your illusions about anything.
"But,uh, won't the police say--"
"Hey,the rat's the one destroying evidence,not me."
We're not sure that it is evidence.
It may not be the knife she used.
"If it is the knife, we are going with self-Defense."
So we are not going to deny that she killed him with it.
"Of course,the cops could still charge us with evidence tampering."
"Well,that's no problem."
We'll just defend ourselves.
"We're tntg,right?"
"""We don't lose."""
"They really didn't go over this part in law school,mr."
Graves.
It's okay.
The defense lawyers
Have as much right to gather evidence as prosecutors.
Most defense lawyers are just too lazy or scared to do it.
"Plus,if we waited for the cops to find evidence,"
We'd never win our cases.
Come on.
Let's just hope it was self-Defense.
"'Cause if it wasn't, we just found the evidence"
That's gonna convict our client.
Good work.
Come on.

You got more and more beautiful since I last saw you.
How do you do that?
What is your secret?
It's youth.
And she's clever too.
I haven't seen you forever.
"Mom, can I stay for a bit?"
"Yeah, if it's okay with Nicole."
"I'm gonna put you to work if you're gonna stay, so get changed, and there's an extra pair of gloves by the door."
Okay.
"Don't dig too deep, okay?"
Why?
Is this where you're hiding all the bodies?
Kind of.
Remember when Mom had that problem with the morning glories?
"Yeah, she was obsessed."
"I mean, they're beautiful, but she said there was too much of them, too much beauty."
Yeah.
"If you don't control them, they end up taking over the whole garden, strangling all the other plants."

"If anything ever happened to me, you'd take care of them, right?"
"Normally I'm not usually happy to see to see a dead man but I'm happy, I really am."

"Your Honour, my client's future rests on the testimony of this man and this man only."
I'll allow it.
"But no fishing expeditions, Mr Greene."
Your Honour.
"Mr Shrimpton, you said you know my client."
I've seen him around.
Did he ever give you money?
Yeah.
"Yeah, once he did."
"He helped a lot of homeless people, didn't he?"
"He used to come around, paint us, give out cash."
"In fact, he gave away thousands of dollars, didn't he?"
Fair bit.
"It was you who led my client to the lane that night, wasn't it?"
He said he wanted to paint him.
"Because you told Denny, and I quote,"
'Benny's an effing little Adonis.'
"Yeah, I don't remember me exact words."
Had you had oral sex yourself with Ben Rigby that evening?
"Come on, Mr Shrimpton."
Maybe a brief but therapeutic tryst up a back lane?
"Yeah, but, you know, just a quick one."
Take comfort.
Premature ejaculation's not on trial here.
"Listen, pal, I seen that sick bastard there whack that poor little kiddie."
And yet you did nothing to stop him.
"Went and got help, didn't I?"
Maybe you went and got an alibi.
"See, I'm at a bit of a loss, Mr Shrimpton."
"You say my client kills the boy he's gone to give money to and then instead of bolting, he drags his body 30m down a lane, and then hangs around for 15 minutes."
Why would he do that?
Especially you after you get your cut.
"What, I'm not entitled?"
I assume all the risk.
It's business.
You know how many bodies I see come through my hospital mortuary each week?
/ No.
Accident victims.
"Kids with healthy, beautiful transplantable organs at their loved ones won't sign a consent to donate."
That's their choice.
You wouldn't be saying that if it was your mother.
"Or your wife, or your child that were dying."
"You know, you'd be begging for my phone number."
"Well, your number's up."
Feds will be putting you away for ten years easy.
"But give us the transplant surgeon, and we'll see to it that you're home by Christmas."
"Oh, man."
"You guys didn't hear a word I said, did you?"
This guy thinks he's the second coming.
"Well, he's got a point."
- Are you an organ donor?
- Yup.
I thought Jews had to be buried with all their body parts.
I figure the Big guy will give me a pass if I leave a piece of myself to help someone else.
- What about you?
- I told Kathy I wanna.
Did you check off that little box on your license?
- No.
- Why?
- I don't know.
- I know why.
You're afraid to face your own mortality.
"- Well, who isn't?"
If it were some female's handkerchief you would have traced it within a minute.
Look at this!
Uncle will be very happy!
Uncle is very fortunate!
When the rascal Kania doesn't find the dyes his face will be worth a look.
"In fact, Kania's face will be worth a look when he doesn't even find this godown!"
Are you sprinkling rosewater in some marriage or petrol?
- Hurry up. I'm very hungry.
- This petrol is very much like you.
"In appearance, it's as cold as water."
One can never know that it must have so much fire within.
"Looking at you, who would know that all the girls of Mumbai are stuffed up in your little heart!"
Don't you speak like this!
"As it is, where are the girls in Mumbai these days?"
All of them have become Putlibai's!
What are you doing?
- How fast can you run?
- l see...
You want to enter into a race with me?
Not with you but with this fire!
- You want to race with death?
- Life becomes joyful when one runs holding the fingers of death.
What do you say?
Fire is very menacing.
"As soon as it touches petrol, it shoots out like a bullet."
We are no less.
You are a flame.
And I am fire!
What do you say?
- Let's do it.
- Shall we?
Run!
"While you, mister... you have been cooped up at sea, eating nothing but broth and dry biscuits."
"Aye, but I still have the beating of a savage in me."
Especially when they cost me so much!
I do not think so.
You can't defeat us all.
Last blood for me as well.
You haven't shed it yet.
Now who's on their back?
What the hell's going on?
Get your scurvy arses back down below.
You have to go now.
Go!
Keep your gun on them all.

He fell overboard.
He'll do well to survive with that wound he has.
Then good riddance.
"Well, at least they're stuck here a while longer while they fix our ship."
I don't think atkins and his men will travel too far into the jungle anymore.
"Today, the battle may have been lost, but the war is far from over."
"Have faith, my friend."
We will get you home.
Come.
"The reason Lian is able to treat Gong Xi seriously is she completely focuses on her acting, such that no one can tell her foot is in fact injured."
"Before the guest leaves, I can't collapse."
Gong Xi...
Gong Xi!
"Please give me another opportunity, let me have another try."
Please.
You gave me 100 points?
Despite having no talent you nevertheless go all-out.
Okay.
Mr. Deline.
"You, you and you."
You work pretty fast.
"Well, opportunity knocked, I answered."
Apparently.
"This ghost thing is big, Ed."
"Bookings have skyrocketed, up to a year in advance."
Really?
Yeah.
I guess there's no accounting for taste or judgment.
"Well, that reminds me, I wanna talk to you about Monica's haunted suite."
Listen to me.
"If you mention the ghost one more time like it exists, one of us is crazy and I'm not."
I'm talking about our bottom line.
I've gotten literally hundreds of calls from people wanting to rent the suite.
"Now if the Burkes don't want it, and we buy back Monica's suite and we rent it out..."
Hold it.
It's just...
"No, no, no, no."
I've already run the numbers.
"Even if we pay the Burkes top dollar, we'll still turn a profit within a few months."
We'll make a killing.
We'll make a killing?
"Oh, bad choice of words."
"I've thought about what you proposed, Mr. Burke, Mrs. Burke."
"And since you no longer want the suite,"
"I'm willing to let you out of the deal and, uh, refund your entire purchase price."
"Oh, so now that the place is famous, you want it back."
"Mr. Deline, I am not a fool."
I understand how valuable that suite's become to you.
I was downstairs.
You never said ...um...
the show is not gonna be ready today.
"If we would have known that we wouldn't be ready tomorrow, we wouldn't be playing tomorrow."
I'm slightly irritable beyond slightly... if we don't play tomorrow I'll be really really mad.
Nothing could have been left to fucking bullshit...
"Now, I've wasted all day in doing this, you know,"
I'll probably be up all night with you guys.
In terms of general looks.
Let me just...
do you have a pen on you?
That song should be super-moody...
Help Me I am In Hell should be... you're just watching a light show.
Let's just do this.
We'll start trying to get this to happen.
Tomorrow at noon we'll see where we are.
"You know, maybe everything's done, perfect in time, cool, by this afternoon..."
It's because we have the framework that works.
Here is the other challenge that we never done before.
"Normally the set is orchestrated, started out, come back up..."
"Ok, wait!"
"Ok, wait up!"
We'll be right there!
We're gonna do a little sideburn?
Am I good?
You good.
Check it out.
Hey Trent!
Awesome dude!
You fucking pigs
Fuck you
"Step right up, march, push."
"Crawl right up on your knees, please, greed, feed."
"That must put the total around 500,000 yen."
"I think that would be about right, but I'll check."
"No, need to do that."
Just deposit it for me.
I'll do it.
"When Japan lost the war, it lost its spiritual beauty."
Yagi says that Freedom has been haunting Japan for quite some time.
"Does the curse of that old ghost cause your troubles, too?"
Yagi is really worried that the jobs and kimono will run out.
There isn't much left.
"I'm even going to sell the ""Hana."""
"Namiko, let's make a clean break with the lies of our twenties."
How?
Leave.
Leave and do what?
Come live with me.
Why didn't you say that twenty years ago?
"I thought a woman's happiness was in marriage, so I held back."
But it's still true that a woman's happiness is in marriage.
We've been seeing each other as friends for twenty years.
We can't live this lie any longer.
"For Yagi's sake, for your children's sake, please."
Leave him.
For twenty years I've lived for my daughter.
I wanted her to be a ballerina.
"That is my great, unfulfilled wish, but it's only been an excuse to live."
It didn't make me happy.
My wife left me with a child.
I want you to be the mother of my child.
I don't want to hear that.
You don't know what I'm going through now.
Stay in your position after your pirouette.
Staying together would be stranger.
You of all people should understand that.
What do you mean?
"The man on your cell phone wallpaper isn't this detective here, is it?"
"So cops have affairs, too!"
You had an affair with Ikezawa.
"No, I didn't."
Then why run away with him?
We both knew we were drawn to each other.
"He was an apprentice chef, and I was the chef's wife."
We honestly didn't have a physical relationship.
"When my husband got drunk, he used to get violent and hit me."
The restaurant itself... was renovated from a restaurant that my father had operated.
I was the owner.
My father put in all the money.
My husband had a complex about it.
He would drink and then hit me...
Ikezawa sympathized with me.
He always offered some kind words to me.
But he stole your proceeds.
I suggested we take the money and run.
That makes you an accomplice.
"That's right, I'm just as guilty as he is."
"She won't talk, she wins as long as she keeps silent for 20 hours."
"That's it, I'm taking her in."
Stand up.
I'm taking you no matter what.
Fine.
"But first I need to go to the restroom, okay?"
"Please, pick up!"
"Yasuo, get out of there, hurry!"
A cop came here as a customer and I got caught.
But all right tell me something you've done in the last four years.
That's the least bit out of the ordinary.
"Other than that bizarre ""Stanford whoo"" thing."
Are you kidding me?
The last four years of my life have been anything but ordinary.
Wonderful.
How?
I can't tell you.
Then I can't reconsider your application.
"But if I could tell you You'd be all ""nuh-uh."""
"And I'd be like ""yuh-huh."""
"And you'd be like ""no way""."
"I'd be like ""yeah way""."
"Wait, please."
I never even got a cookie.
[Singing] If you're wondering what she'll do.
Now that her plans have fallen through.
And you know she's got a real strong will.
And she's got lots more show to fill.
"Now she's going, going back to Malibu."
We kinda thought we'd be singing too.
Instead we're stuck in her chorus line.
[Chuckles]
'Cause your agent's not as good as mine.
"Wait, wait, if Miley leaves, we have no ride."
Hey Miley how far away are you?
I'm turning into the driveway and I'll be in in a second.
Hey I know you're disappointed so I'm making your favorite dinner.
Mac and cheese and bacon!
That's your favorite dad.
"You know the way she's feeling, that probably wouldn't have made any difference anyway."
This way at least one of us will be happy.
I don't know.
I don't know.
They're probably not gonna pick me.
"Don't give up hope, Riley."
You never know.
"Hey, what's Connor doin'?"
Connor.
What's goin' on?
"Everything's fine, I'm just gonna go around to the back."
"Hey, player, I have one for you."
"So, a cop shows up to a crime scene, and a citizen shows up and says, officer, officer, quick, there is a hundred minorities and a plumber that really need your help, and um..."
"And the cop says, oh no, we should help the plumber, and the citizen says, see, cops never care about the minorities."
"Wait, is that right?"
Okay.
"A citizen runs up to a cop and says a hundred minorities and a plumber need your help, the cop says, why the plumber?"
"Then the citizen says, see, the cops never ask about the minorities."
Damn it.
"He just forgot all the important parts, right."
"Fucking cops hate minorities, man."
"Dude, I got pulled over for tinted windows once."
Hate the po po.
I'm in hell.
What are you doing?
Just being safe.
There's no one in the house.
You sure about that?
"I mean, you never know."
"No, our whole job depends on being sure."
You should always know.
How long did you monitor the owner's pattern?
"I know the plans say he won't be back for a few weeks, but how long did you monitor his routine?"
"Like, two-"
"You know, your old man, he loved them horses."
He absolutely loved them and you know that.
What is wrong with you?
Right now he's flipped around in that grave of his.
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, boy."
"Matt, I think something that we can actually agree on is that we need to keep these horses healthy."
Because it's part of your deal as a permit holder.
- Correct.
- So it is in your best interest to make sure the horses are in good shape.
What're you saying?
"I'm just saying that maybe Ty, with his vet experience, should monitor the horses' condition while they're in your care, and I can help."
No.
They don't need to be monitored.
They're fine.
You don't know that.
"They're wild, right?"
So they could have any number of diseases.
Diseases that could spread to other stock.
To healthy stock.
"Come on, Matt."
What're you afraid of?
- Yeah!
- Let 'em check out the horses.
Fine.
Monitor the horses.
"But that's it, you hear me?"
"She said she loved me, Jeffie, and... she said I was just like my mom and she gave me all these pictures and stuff and..."
Okay.
"Well, can I call you once you're done work?"
Okay.
I'll let you know what it happens.
Okay.
She's got more confidence in me than I have in my...
"Larry, you stopped and spoke to her?"
We chatted a while.
You chatted a while.
Yes.
"Larry, I resign from the Waterhouse account."
You...
You resign?
What are you talking about?
I will not accept any job that my wife got for me.
You got this job because you're the best man for it.
That's not the point.
Any success I make I'm going to make on my own or not at all.
Samantha.
"Now, you listen to me."
I have had it with your magic and spells.
Now be quiet.
I'm not finished yet.
"I've had it up to here with all your witchcraft turning me into a werewolf, into a chimpanzee!"
"I'm not through yet, Sam."
"Just to prove that I have had it, I am going to blow this account."
Do you hear me?
I'm gonna blow the account!
What do you think of that?
Is this 555-7328?
"Look, I'll have to make this fast."
Mr. Waterhouse is outside.
"Before you meet him, I want to brief you..."
- I don't need any briefing.
"- Darrin, Waterhouse is a very conservative man."
He's been making thumbtacks since 1888 and he doesn't go for this modern hoopla.
I don't know why he decided to change agencies and come with us but take a tip from me and play it sincere and conservative.
I found out why
Bin-Khalid's people wanted the strongbox.
Inside there was a flash drive containing a list of sleeper cells that bin-Khalid set up here along with all the codes to trigger their attacks.
"It looked like 15, maybe 20 cells but I didn't have the list for very long."
He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.
I am still waiting to find out what that is.
Do you believe he'd really do that?
"He's angry, and he's unstable."
I do.
We'll keep looking for him here.
Let us know if he makes contact.
"Yeah, I am heading over to 13th."
Keep looking for Grimes.
I'm going to talk to Keith.
"Rebecca, what the hell's going on?"
Have you lost your mind?
"- Keith, listen to me."
"- No, let me out of here, now!"
I can't do that.
Not until I know if I can trust you.
Trust me?
Because I'm the one who's acted completely out of bounds?
The ranger squad that killed bin-Khalid
Was attacked this morning.
Four of them were murdered and their families.
What are...
"The rangers were living under new identities that only three people had access to - the directors of CIA, NSA... and you."
And you think I gave them up?
No.
I don't.
But I have to be sure.
"I want to clear you, but I need your help."
But we'll fight on.
"That's what Mr. Churchill says, and I believe him."
"I think you must be insane, father, if you believe what these people say."
They're sick.
And they don't know a thing.
[Door slams]
"These notes are very good, very thorough, milner."
"Thank you, sir."
I'm afraid they don't tell us the one thing that we need to know-- who fired the shots.
Or why they were fired in the dark.
And if Spencer was the actual target...
That's very likely.
Why wait for an after-dinner meeting when everyone's around?
Easier and less risky to wait until he's left or leaving the hotel or even gone up to his room and shoot him while he's asleep.
"Yes, I know."
I wondered about that.
Why wait for the exact moment when the lights go out?
Because you can't be seen.
"Well, you can't see either."
How do you know you're getting the right target?
You spoke to woolton?
"Yes, it was his gun, but I don't believe for a second he fired it."
"And it was thrown away, wasn't it?"
He'd have taken it with him.
"How about David Lane, sir?"
"He could have taken the gun, made his way through the hotel."
Maybe the lights went out just as he was about to fire.
"They were all in the room, the room was blacked out, the door was closed."
Stanley was sitting right outside.
Then he'd have seen him.
Exactly.
What about Stanley Ellis?
"Death that has killed my daughter, ties my tongue and drains my eyes and will not let me grieve."
"Oh, child."
My soul more than my child.
Dead are you now.
Alack.
"My child is dead... and with my child, all my joys are buried."
"Oh, come, sir, for shame."
"And think of her poor soul, freed now from care and safe in heaven's bliss."
Give up your grief and bring sweet-smelling flowers to lay upon her corpse with gentle tears.
"Then take her to church, where she may sleep among her kin for all eternity."
The plans we made for joyful celebration must turn instead to mark our sorrowing woe.
Our merry hymns to sullen dirges change.
"Sir, madam, make ready for our march, to take this lovely child to her grave."
We cannot know why it is heaven's will.
But we must trust in him who orders all.
Stop!
"I beseech you, sir."
In heaven's name.
"Say now, are you a holy man of God?"
"I am a novice, but I serve God, yes."
Have you made study in the art of herbs?
- I have.
- My son is sick.
I have an errand to perform in Mantua.
- By when?
- Before tonight.
Mantua is but two leagues away.
I'll take you there myself.
Then show me your child.
"Will there be anything else, sir?"
"No, thank you, Jack."
- Cousin.
You were so funny last night.
- Ohh.
I was wondering if you could help us out?
Oh I'd be delighted to share my... comedic expertise.
We who are clowns are known for our generosity.
Maybe you can help us settle an argument we were having.
Shoot.
What's funnier?
This... or this?
Or... is two at once funny?
How about... this?
Is this funny?
I think... this.
You are so right!
That is funny!
Thank you so much for helping us.
I'm glad I could be of service.
"Now if you'll excuse me,"
I have a class to teach.
"You know, it's a remarkable feeling to be able to make someone else laugh."
"It's almost as if you have the power to get inside their brain, and tickle it."
I can do that with a chopstick.
"Imagine how different war would be, if instead of trying to kill each other, people just showed up armed with jokes."
"But you could still have guns, right?"
"Because, you know, eventually you'd stop laughing, and want to get on with the killing."
You know what I found out?
Humour's subjective.
What do you mean?
"Well, I thought the fact that no one was laughing at you at the comedy club was hysterical."
"Oh, I loved that."
No no.
"No, that wasn't funny."
"Ok, dad."
Right away.
My dad is really angry with me.
I have to get going now.
"Before you go, you were saying something?"
I was wondering if they'd removed the pool problems from the course outline.
You look beautiful.
"Actually, if you leave your hair loose... and put on some make up, you are a beautiful girl."
What's Ozgur doing?
"He's clinging on to his lessons, studying like crazy."
Mert is failing.
Do you know why I'm saying that Mert's failing?
Because he's not studying.
"I swear to God, I am studying."
You see me studying.
He's lying.
"It's not enough to study, Mr. Mert."
We do.
But having to study for school and selection exam both is very difficult.
What are we going to do then?
We should at least find a solution for the school.
"I thought everything would be okay if I came to school, but this is worse."
"Actually, you know what?"
We should just steal the test papers... and get it over with.
What did you say?
"I didn't say anything, dude."
This is it man!
This is the first time you have ever said something sensible.
"So, are you suggesting that we should steal the papers?"
Are you crazy?
"Actually, I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time... but I wasn't sure if I should or not."
I love it when you talk like this.
My mother also wanted to prepare everything for me.
"You pay, you come... I don't know why you come."
A waste of time every week.
You don't do anything here.
Why don't you practise?
Such a distance... a waste of time.
When I wanted to take piano lessons:
No I won't allow that!
"It was a question of whether I would go to the conservatory, or go on to study something else."
Dad said:
No!
"That was after the First World War, when Russian aristocrats were playing in bars."
He didn't want to allow that.
He didn't believe I'd be a pianist.
While everyone else said I could make a career.
And what's the result?
"You're an ordinary teacher, just scraping a living."
Now I'm happy I'm a teacher.
I like doing it. I enjoy it.
"But before I got to it, the things I had to give up..."
During the Protectorate I used to play in an orchestra.
I counted on going to study after the war.
My dream was some embassy.
I wanted to see the world.
And that was all I could afford.
The Protectorate put a stop to that.
"At grammar school the girls used to tell me, what are you worrying about!"
You'll make a career as an actress.
"For example, Ji?"
"¨ª Krej¨¨¨ªk, who went into films, said:"
One day I'll make a feature film.
You'll play the second main role.
What are the windows at the back?
What's that?
I think those are dressing rooms.
"If these are the dressing rooms, these other windows are at the front."
That's gotta be the apartment where Reardon sleeps.
Could be.
This is good.
You still need some of my guys?
"No, I got a few of my own crew up here, now."
I'll be in touch when I need you.
You know this man?
That's Gordon Evans.
He's a president at my bank.
And this man?
No.
"George Browne, President of the Blackmire Group."
Evans tells me we're gonna be washing money for him.
So I understand.
I'm gonna want records of those transactions.
- Should be able to get those.
- I have another question.
"You're still getting out of the weed business, right?"
"- I'm trying hard, yeah."
- We've concerns about how that might affect the level of violence in the trade.
"Well, we'd like to see a smooth transition happen here."
We can't afford to see a whole new crop of players move in and set up shop.
We just... don't have the resources to stay on top of it.
Are you trying to tell me who I should sell to?
I'd like to have some input.
What works for you?
"Well, if you sold to Dante and the Vietnamese, 50-50... probably keep things more or less stabilised."
"Probably, but I don't know if that's gonna work."
STEVE:
"Oh, of cour..."
"I'm sorry, right."
So somebody else killed him and you covered it up?
That doesn't make any sense.
It's the truth.
Is it?
We didn't want anyone connecting Cutler back to us.
"So, yes, we covered it up."
"Look, Cutler was feeding us good intel."
There was... there was no reason to kill him.
"In fact, we tried to save him."
What?
What are you talking about?
He called us for help right after he'd been shot.
"And-and I can prove that, too."
We had a burner phone that we kept in touch with him...
We know about the phone.
What happened next?
We sent a medic.
"But by the time he got there,"
Cutler had been dead for a while.
"After that, we were just, you know, worried about controlling the situation."
Damage control.
"Well, maybe you ought to start worrying about your legal defense, because right now you're looking at obstruction of justice and accessory after the fact."
Okay.
"Yeah, you got me dead to rights."
But... maybe... we could help each other out.
How do you figure?
"Well, what if I were to say that, um... in the course of cleaning the crime scene, my people... may have gathered evidence."
Evidence that could help you catch whoever killed Cutler.
(sighs) What a mess.
"It's a funny thing to sell your soul for, a new Beamer."
"Yeah, cars have never really done it for me."
"Well, what has?"
"Apart from your work, of course."
My work's enough.
And now you have a new toy.
One that you gave the full VIP treatment to.
You gave me the impression he was very important.
We could've hauled him in at the hotel.
I know that.
- Do you mind if I ask why?
- He'd been in prison for five years.
That's very charitable of you.
And aren't you always telling me that the stick is a weapon for the short term?
I'm glad somebody listens to me.
Best hope he doesn't fall for you.
He's more likely to try and kill me.
And why should you care?
Glittering in a place where a heart should be.
Go and make a drink.
Why are we watching this geezer?
Because Lenny hasn't decided what to do with him yet.
Neighbours used to have loads of them in the garden.
"Fishing rods, little ones."
Sitting on mushrooms.
Mum said it lowered the tone.
Gnomes.
I don't like gnomes.
"Also, I don't like fire-eaters."
I don't like dried fruit of any kind.
And I don't like those big mental dogs that come running at you in parks.
"You wouldn't just let a lion or crocodile run loose in Regent's Park, would you?"
"You know, I didn't even think about her."
"God, what if...?"
I wonder if she even knows.
"Not exactly a normal couple night out, huh?"
It was surprisingly normal considering how blindsided you were.
You want something to drink?
"Yes, please."
I think I have to just sit.
And not move.
"If I do, who knows what else is going to come along and rip my life apart."
- You're right.
- Thank you.
Let's not move.
It's too big a risk.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Why do anything?
"Well, eventually I'm going to have to get up."
"The thing is, everybody keeps telling me that I have this sister."
I don't know what the hell that means.
"I mean, when I think of Sarah, I don't think of her DNA."
I think about how we grew up together in the same house with the same weird family.
"And how we, you know, shared our diaries and our shampoos."
But am I supposed to have those same feelings
- for a woman that I never even met?
- I don't think anybody expects that.
"Well, and then there's my dad."
I've been grieving for a father that I don't even know.
And I was just starting to get all... happy.
I wouldn't let this destroy that.
You hold on to what's good.
To what makes you happy.
You make me happy.
25 miles west of nome.
Off sledge island...
"- hey, zeke, you copy?"
"- Yes, I copy."
I'm gonna crawl down The hose here.
"After narrowly Escaping the bends,"
"Zeke tenhoff is Down under once again,"
This time in shallower waters.
It would be really encouraging.
Just to see one little Micro flyspeck of gold.
It's been a while Since I've seen one.
But the team is still Coming up empty handed.
I don't want to think Of what's gonna happen.
If we don't succeed In making money at all.
This is really Our very last chance.
To make a future for ourselves.
What is this place?
Good god.
"I can see some rocks down here,"
A lot of big old boulders.
"Well, um, I mean I think we Just have to keep looking, man."
"Well, um, looks like there's Some pockets of gravel."
In between some of these rocks I haven't tried dredging on.
Where is the gold?
I miss gold so much.
I didn't realize how Emotionally Dependent I am on gold.
Kind of does look like It might be bedrock.
So it's a bunch of boulders On top of bedrock.
"If there's gold here, We're just gonna have to."
Keep hunting around Everywhere to find it.
"You know, I think I just want to lift up."
"One of these boulders and see Maybe underneath the boulder,"
Named her Fen for the record.
Check for yourself.
And she's happy where she is.
I very much doubt that.
There's no force the way I handle her.
She's content as long as she gets fed.
So no law broken.
See for yourself.
I've nothing to hide.
Do you know this man?
Never clapped eyes on him.
I had to stop myself from throttling the man who keeps her.
I had neither the ability to arrest him or to rescue her.
She is his legal property.
That's appalling!
"A man is allowed to exhibit a young girl in a cage, and there's nothing I can do about it."
(Julia sighing)
What of our victim's body?
"His wounds were mostly superficial, the most pronounced being facial lacerations."
"He was gouged, likely by claws or nails."
And this.
A deep bite on his right hand.
The wounds were made with pointed incisor teeth.
So likely an animal attack then?
That would have been my conclusion if not for the stab wound in his upper back.
"The thrust was a downward motion, but not a fatal blow."
- Then how did he die?
- He bled to death.
"If he hadn't been trapped, he may have survived."
What time would he have been stabbed?
I couldn't say.
I only know that he died between 2 and 4 in the morning.
I'll hit at 11:00.
"When the diamonds get here, you check out."
- And don't let anyone see you.
"- What do you think I am, an amateur?"
"No, lover."
You're just a reluctant old pro trying to make a comeback.
So keep your fingers crossed.
[knock on door]
"Come in, Paul."
"Well, working kind of late, aren't you?"
Yeah.
"Well, hallelujah."
I just thought you peasants might like a touch of glamour in your drab lives.
I'm impressed.
What kind of a singing job do you do tonight?
Thanks a lot.
I happen to be going to a very posh birthday party.
Protecting the family jewels?
"No, a wealthy niece."
Her aunt thinks her young man is a fortune hunter.
- Is he?
"- Well, he's poor."
"Anyway, the girl's 21 today, so Auntie had to let the guy come to the party."
"She's just afraid that later on, when things get jumping, the two kids might try and run off together."
"If the girl's of age, how are you supposed to stop it?"
"Well, I do know he was married in Texas once, so if I have to, I can try and run a bluff on that."
Wasn't he divorced?
So far I haven't been able to establish it-- either way.
"Will if the bluff fails, you should try charming her yourself."
I must say you do look dashing.
"Oh, you finally got around to admitting it."
"Good night, Perry."
Dana!
We just found out we lost our qualifying slot.
"We don't qualify, we don't race."
"Believe me, guys, I'm working on it, okay?"
The racing committee assumed we weren't racing because of what happened to Jared.
"If we don't race, we don't get points."
"Look, I know this is a hard time for you, but..."
"Don't worry, I'm on it!"
"Harrison, Cal, these are federal agents."
They're investigating the crash.
Investigating what?
I thought it was an accident.
"Yeah, we're not so sure."
"Go, get ready."
I'll get us a slot.
"Sorry, I gotta get back to work, guys."
Whoa.
"No, not until you tell us what you and Jared's father are hiding."
We know Jared was stabbed.
"We know he had over $100,000 of stolen money in his garage, and we know there's no way that you didn't know something about this."
"And this does not look good for Jared right now, Dana."
"If you care about him, you'll help us."
I wish I could.
"If you're scared for some reason, we can protect you."
"But if we find out you're withholding anything, we have to arrest you."
I have to go.
Please.
(cell phone beeps)
That must be one hell of a secret.
Yeah.
A text from Sebastian.
It says that Christopher wanted him to tell us that Jared was definitely murdered.
She'll bounce back.
It's not like she hasn't had any practice.
That's true.
"And even if you do quit, it's not gonna help her any."
She's still off the play.
"Oh, that's good."
I gotta write that one down.
(Opens drawer)
"You know, if you really think about it, if I'm in the play... (Pen clicks)"
Then Sue's in the play.
"Yeah, don't go with that one."
"...and then I heard the door, and then I came here."
Brick's grandparents and special people day--
Any of that ring a bell?
"Oh, well, I-I don't think that was, uh, that was actually a firm commitment."
(Scoffs) Nothing's ever a firm commitment with you.
This is what you do.
You didn't even bother to show up at my wedding.
"(Chuckles) Well, who has a wedding on a weekend?"
Everyone on Earth.
"You know, Brick was really counting on you, and... (Sighs) You know what?"
Forget it.
"I'm not gonna even bother explaining it to you, 'cause you're never gonna get it."
Hey.
Thought you could use a snack.
Now is grandma dead?
"She's fine, but speaking of grandma, well, you know, that reminds me of a funny story."
"When I was little, your grandma and I decided it would be fun to get matching mother-daughter dresses, so we went shopping all over town looking for the right ones, and finally, we found the perfect dress,"
"but they only had one, and it fit grandma, but it didn't fit me."
Ohh.
"Anyway, grandma got the dress, and I was so happy."
She bought the dress?
Frank Gallo left a message for you a few minutes ago.
- What did he say?
"- He said you and Mike better not be trying to screw him over again, or you're gonna regret it."
"Harvey, what's he talking about?"
"I don't know, but I'm sure as hell gonna find out."
♪♪
What the hell are you doing with Frank Gallo?
Harvey...
Don't pretend like you don't know.
He just left me a message asking me to make sure that you don't fu... him over.
"I told you, I'm working on a Brooklyn Housing Authority case."
Gallo is from Brooklyn.
He knows people.
And don't tell me he's making you pay for his information.
"Yes, he is, and I'm gonna pay him."
"Mike, odds are he doesn't know jack shit and he's just using you to get money."
"No, I looked into it, all right?"
What he told me checks out.
He's on the right side of this thing.
You're telling me he's all of a sudden Mother Teresa?
- This guy tried to kill you!
- I know that.
"Look, I'm not saying he's a saint."
I'm saying that I know what I'm doing.
Don't you get it?
A guy like Gallo finds people to get revenge on.
"He thinks about it and thinks about it, and the only way to survive that is to stay out of his mind and let him find someone else."
"Maybe you're right, but I already promised him something for his information, and if I back out of that now,"
I'm gonna end up on the top of his list.
Does Rachel know about this?
♪♪
- No.
"All right, I'll be right there."
What is it?
A blue vest.
Thenit's time to go.
What happened?
He was wearing military boots like the Mokra.
It was a trap.
A trap?
And you saw it?
My clever girl.
We'll be all right.
We have each other.
Thas all we'll need.
Is not that simple.
We can't just walk into the prison without weapons.
Maybe we'll have to try a different strategy.
We don't have to ask your friend any more questions if you give us the answers.
"I told you, I don't..."
I'm sorry.
I guess I...
I always assumed that Vulcans didn't feel pain like the rest of us;
that you were able to block it out somehow until I heard...
Was that you I heard?
Vulcans are capable of suppressing certain levels of physical pain.
"Beyond that, we must simply endure the experience."
How can you say that so calmly?
You must feel some anger at what they did to you... some desire to fight back.
"Under the circumstances, physical resistance is ineffective."
We are...fighting back by refusing to give them any information.
Get down there!
Three more hours.
There's nothing going on around here.
"The point is, we have cut off their troops communications, and we've put our own troops on the ground."
"So as soon as the centurions retrieve the Eye, you can take out Galactica."
"Okay, here's the deal."
We're out of options.
"The cylons have got us pinned on this rock, and our only way out of here is to hold this place until Galactica can send a rescue party."
"So I've divided you into two teams, okay ?"
Team one is gonna be distributing ammunition throughout the camp.
Team two is gonna be making homemade tylium mines.
"I know that's not glamorous work, but we gonna need the extra firepower in case the cylons decide to take a shot at us."
"Look, I know some of you are scared."
"And that's okay, 'cause"
I'm scared too.
"But if we keep our heads, and we do our jobs, we can do this."
We can all get out of here in one piece.
And Berley has a list of your names and your assignments.
Make sure you get with her.
See you outside.
That was good.
Honest.
You'd make a good officer.
"An officer, huh ?"
Like you.
"Someone who swears an oath, and knows how to keep it ?"
I'm not really sure
- what you think is going on...
"- Don't insult me, okay ?"
I'm not stupid.
I know my wife.
I know how she is.
We been married for a year and a half.
"What, do you think you're the first ?"
I chose to marry Kara.
"Same as you, admiring the bikinis."
"Well, I doubt you would have come to Quito just for that."
I also doubt you came for the same.
"You know that wherever there are beautiful women, I shall be there."
I'll buy you a drink.
Lets.
"And, tell me, Inspector, how did your ...."
You where saying?
"No, I have a prior engagement, I will see you later."
Did you have any problems?
"No, everything is rolling along, Ms. Bristol."
"Except for one thing, that girl, I have seen her somewhere else."
Which one?
The red head.
A member of the International Service?
"I do not know, but it is something we must find out."
"There is no time for that, there is but one solution."
"There is, we must not take any risks."
"Truly, I am having the best of luck."
This is my first night off.
What did you say your name was?
I didn't say.
"Well, it does not matter, a name is not that important."
It seems you do not like to waste any time.
Of course not.
Then what are you doing here?
you will accompish nothing here.
"Well, It will have to be enough to just admire the view."
I tought you would have been more daring.
"You are right, I am actually quite shy."
"Tell me, are you still free tonight?"
Of course!
Who's got to come here.
He only wants to go to bed with you.
"Nobody, nobody fucks at the club, everybody's gay."
It's you who thinks about fucking all the time.
"Your vocabulary is punctuated to two words ""Shit"" and ""Fuck""."
What do you say I should say making love instead of fucking?
So what do you think?
Is that better professor?
I think you look like a hooker.
And you act like a hooker.
You'll end up in a hospital with some horrible sexual disease.
"You don't understand, so I look like a hooker?"
So what?
You like it...
I know that you like it.
So why should I live these lies?
The way you want me to dress and behave is as a sweet housewife slave of her husband's will.
A hooker at least is independant ...nobody's victim.
"It's the only fair that I warn them, this pussy has teeth."
You're my best student.
I invested a lot of time in you.
What do you say?
We've spent most possible time in bed.
"You know, Adrian has turned you into a real mean bitch."
Every body says so.
Try to be nice.
What do you think?
Do you like this professor?
I think you look better in jeans that in a turtleneck.
"Yes, professor."
May I help you?
Yes...what side of the building do your windows face?
He was just leaving.
"Do you ever make a decision that at the time seems sound, but quickly reveals itself to be empty?"
"Good-bye, Philip."
I don't like you.
He's kind of an asshole.
What a strange feeling.
"So off... it's like my head is a car, but I can't drive fast because there's too much traffic."
"So instead I'm just moving very, very slowly."
"It's so hard, what I do."
"I mean, it's not at all, and that is the joke, right?"
"- (SIGHS) God, this is so boring."
- A big joke.
Ashley's so bored right now.
Just go back where you came from.
"I'm getting angry at myself, do you understand?"
Because it doesn't even upset me to see you like this.
I want you to leave and leave me alone.
"I don't know why you are here, but I'm not interested, so don't tell me."
"God, do you remember there was a time when we just..."
"We wanted to go to sleep together and wake up together, every day, indefinitely."
Now I don't even give a shit if I ever see you again.
"I want you to leave, and just don't come back and stop hurting me."
I got asked to write a short story about photography.
By who?
"Oh, God, you'd be so mad if I told you."
Isn't that what you want?
I don't know what you want me to say.
You used to be so exciting.
Now you're just pitiful.
"(CLICKS TONGUE) I'm afraid you've seen the last of me for a long, long time."
(ASHLEY CHUCKLES)
(DOOR CLOSES)
She would get very frustrated.
"Anne, you know, lives two blocks from my home."
I see.
And Harriet too would call.
"Yes, and Harriet would call."
"- And so, what would you do?"
"- I mean, he would be, like, MIA."
And sometimes I didn't know where he was or what he was doing.
"But he'd just say, ""I'm not in the office,"
"""so tell them such and such,"
"""or tell them you don't know where I am."
"So, you know, whatever."
"He would tell me what to do, and I just did it."
"So you... you remember, then, the day that Lou left for India the last time?"
"Oh, yes, yes."
You were here to see Lou off with your mother.
Yeah.
How did you know that?
"Well, I was in the office with you, because we couldn't push him out the door."
I came to the office because
I knew he wouldn't...
he'd miss his plane.
And he did the same thing.
He changed his clothes in the room where the Xerox machine was and came walking out all disheveled and left money... foreign currency from another country... all over the place.
And you and your mother literally had to push him into the taxicab.
"And once he got in the cab, then I could go home."
My own memory of that night is somewhat different.
He was working on the model for the Capital of Bangladesh.
We left him at the office at around 10:00.
He waved down to me from the top of the stairs.
The last thing I saw of him was his hand.
"""Dearest boy o' mine,"
"Then Doug turned on him, and I wasn't gonna let that happen."
- I'm sure you made the right decision.
- He took him.
"He just picked him up early at school one day, and he disappeared."
Did you call the police?
Yeah.
Every day.
"But technically, we're still married, and he is Jasper's father... so without a custody order, they can't do anything."
"Oh, please."
I cannot wait for the courts to sort this out.
Do you have any idea where he might have taken him?
None.
"I have no idea, 'cause I've hardly spoken to him in months."
Do you have pictures?
Yeah.
That's Jasper.
Please.
Lucy said you could find him.
"I need to know that he's okay, and I want him back."
I'm gonna find him.
One of the things you learn in training... is to avoid situations that cut too close.
If you had a rough childhood... a situation with an abusive father and a vulnerable kid is gonna make you angry.
"That can be motivating, but it can also be dangerous."
"Well, she's a looker."
What's the story?
- Husband ran off with her kid.
"- You all right, Mike?"
I'm gonna find this guy.
Facts are the hallmark of a good false identity.
It's harder to create history than it is to alter it.
"Plus, the more truth to your lie... the easier it is to remember."
"I don't see you for weeks,and you start going through the closets?"
People from the production crew are really harsh too.
"Even if she is a temporary worker, it shouldn't be like, ""We're about to take a chance to have you fired."""
Look at just what they are doing!
How come those people are so cruel?
"No matter how weak or fragile, you can't just treat a person recklessly."
I will be talking until here.
I'm sorry for blabbering.
Call the director.
"If it's not PD No Eul, I won't shoot a cut be it a documentary or what."
If they don't want the representative actor of the agency then they should put back PD No Eul to her usual place.
"Ahjussi, eat one."
"Okay, I'll stop."
Proposal cancelled.
You should just tell me that you don't want me to be your wife.
Why are you drinking strong soju when you can't even handle alcohol well.
Hey... 'it's not like that No Eul.'
'Why would I reject such a lovely like No Eul?
'
'I just like it so much that I don't know what to do right now.'
You're not saying those.
You still won't say it.
I don't really like it as well!
♬  Just one last night here  ♬
♬  Remembering what we gave up  ♬
♬  This golden love  ♬
"♬  Oh, we were destined  ♬"
He won't even come after me.
He is not that great at all.
Why is he stubborn?
"Ah, this is so embarrassing!"
"Rejected from my job, and rejected from my proposal, nothing went well."
That's because I am the third party!
The uncle.
That was your guy?
"No offence, but I don't take bribes from strangers, you know?"
Better safe than sorry.
That's my motto.
- But I'll take your money!
Sure!
"- No, that offer has expired, yo."
It was kind of low anyways.
"But okay, okay, I'll take it."
"Just tell me what you need, all right?"
I'm easy.
I'm gonna keep a happy thought and assume this is just a negotiating tactic.
"All right, listen to me very carefully."
You are going to give Badger Mayhew the best legal representation ever.
But no deals with the DEA.
All right?
Badger will not identify anyone to anybody.
"If he does, you're dead."
Why don't you just kill Badger?
"I mean, follow me, but if a mosquito is buzzing around you and it bites you on the ass, you don't go gunning for the attorney."
You go grab a fly swatter.
"I mean, so to speak."
"I mean, all due respect, but do I have to spell this out for you?"
"- We're not killing Badger, yo!"
"- Then you got real problems, okay."
Because the DEA will come down on your boy like a proverbial ton of bricks.
"I don't think I'm going out on a limb here but, hey, he's not gonna like prison."
He's gonna sing like Celine Dion regardless of what you do to me.
Mr. Mayhew?
I recognise your cough.
"Take that mask off, you know."
You're on.
May the best lawyer win.
I still can't believe he got fired.
"I mean, the whole time I was covering for him,"
I never thought Larissa would actually... do it.
What is it you're not saying?
Why can't you just admit it?
Admit what?
You knew Bennet was on shaky ground.
What'd you think was gonna happen when you took his story?
That she'd yell at him or something?
"And I'm sorry, but Bennet was never actually going to that party, which means he would have been fired anyway."
I just seized an opportunity.
Anyone would have.
No.
A lot of people wouldn't.
I wouldn't.
"Come on, Carrie."
Admit it.
You went for the jugular.
"You wanted something so bad, you didn't care someone else might get hurt in the process."
It's not that simple.
I didn't mean for Bennet to get hurt.
But he did.
I don't expect you to understand.
You never had to claw your way to get something.
"But if I'm going to be a writer,"
I'm gonna have to work my butt off
- and fight for it.
"- Oh, come on."
"It's not like you're some poor, struggling artist."
You're an intern at a magazine who lives with her father and doesn't have to worry about money or a roof over her head.
Even with a family.
Now I'm just filling in time.
"What have you got, Jack?"
A medal in a drawer.
I should think hard before you hold your hand up for the sacrificial lamb.
You know where I live.
"Always keep your door locked, George."
People get mugged this way.
"Jack, you know I'm not allowed to talk to you."
I don't want to be landed in it.
"Well, neither did I, did I?"
"But I am, right up to my neck."
I didn't ask to work with them.
"No, but I'm bloody glad you are."
"Come on, what's green mean, green, green...."
Sheridan's adamant that he wasn't at the hotel that day.
He was at home with the wife.
A very handy missus for alibis.
So how was Superintendent Bailey?
"Well, I'd like to be able to say that she's every sort of cow under the sun, but unfortunately I think she's quite a good copper."
"Now that Mrs. Sheridan gave quite a good performance as a woman scorned, and she's his only alibi."
She was dodgy once you'd better check the hotel.
I have.
I've been on the phone.
The manager clearly knew
"Mrs. Barr, and Sheridan by sight."
"The description of the man she was with that day is a bit hazy, but it wasn't Sheridan."
What about the bill?
"I've got it here somewhere, I think."
Here we are.
"It's for a meal, and a double room for the night, he thinks they left by six that evening."
"Oh well, thank you very much George, well done."
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.
If you're part of a crew nobody ever tells you they're going to kill you.
It doesn't happen that way.
There aren't any arguments or curses like in the movies.
Your murderers come with smiles.
They come as your friends.
People who cared for you all your life.
They always seem to come in the time when you're weakest and most in need of their help.
So I met Jimmy in a crowded place we both knew.
"I got there 15 minutes early, and Jimmy was already there."
He took the booth near the window so he could see everyone who drove up to the restaurant.
He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.
He was jumpy.
He hadn't touched a thing.
"On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine."
We were supposed to be discussing my case.
But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.
"I been telling you your whole life, don't talk on the fucking phone."
Now you understand?
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.
You know that kid from the city we were talking about?
You know?
The kid turned out to be a rat.
"As soon as he got pinched, he ratted on everybody."
I know where he is.
He's hiding now.
Know what I'm saying?
Would you have a problem going with Anthony to take care of that?
"No, not at all."
That way they got nothing.
Then you'll see a smaller passageway.
"Captain, what are you doing?"
There's one more person I have to find.
Guards!
"After all that time I spent looking for you, all I had to do was wait here."
Shields down to 23 percent.
We've got to get out of their weapons range.
Scan one more time for the away team.
There's no sign of them.
Prepare to break orbit.
Wait!
Set a course bearing 219 mark 47.
"Where are you taking us, Mr. Kim?"
There's a large electrical storm over the northern magnetic pole.
Is giving our sensors some trouble.
It should do the same for theirs.
- A blind spot.
- Exactly.
"If we maintain our position directly above the storm, their sensor net may not be able to keep an accurate lock on our position."
How long do you think this'll work?
The storm's already dissipating.
A few more minutes?
I'll take every second I can get.
"I must say I'm impressed, Caylem."
You never made it this far before.
"Every so often, he goes on one of his missions... to rescue his wife."
She's been dead for 12 years.
Lies.
Lies...
lies!
Sometimes...he gets all the way up to the front gate.
We send him on his way and allow him to serve as a reminder of just how futile it is to challenge us.
"But you said, that you will get from me and sale it with 5°/° commision oh God, i was talking about the design which you were about to show me."
Which design?
The red one.
That's car's photo.
Then why you are showing inside space from outside?
"That means you are not the Laxmi N., who was coming to get car?"
"No... so you thought, that i am other Laxmi Narayan."
"You did this to me, what have you done... if you are not that Laxmi Narayan, then where is he?"
"That would be him, but this is i am."
"Sir, your Son is here who?"
Your Father.
That not my dad.
He is yours...
"Sir, you are not his Father?"
"I am not even married, how could i have son?"
"And now i think, i wont marry ever."
"Sir, everyone has there own taste."
We have one more Laxmi Narayan in spare.
Let me show...
"Sir, i have told you there is one more Laxmi Narayan in this hotel."
"And now even Manager has confirm too, i you will let me go?"
"Sir... shut up, i am stuck here and you want to leave?"
Just listen to me... now what has done is done.
Now listen to me... you... now you have to but the car.
Its worth is 1000000/- you can give 900000/-.
900000/-?
Madam i look stupid from face but i am not.
Why i buy the car?
"You know, in 5 days if i didn't pay the bank installments."
"Then they will my showroom, and just because of that i... otherwise i am not that type of girl."
"I am also not that type of person, do i look like Khurana's?"
"I have the reputation too, you can ask anyone at Chandni Chok if my Son find out that in hotel in one room... with one girl... shame... shame..."
"Nowhere at all, gunfighter."
You done killed yourself a set of perfectly good saddlebags that cost me eight Yankee dollars in gold.
And if you didn't kill my last pint of... of water between me and the angels.
Where did you ever learn to shoot?
"In a better school than you did, fortunately."
"I don't usually miss, friend."
"Neither do I, and I better straighten you out on one thing."
I am no friend of yours.
Here.
Just here.
"That'll be dry, too."
"Worth one, but it's gonna be dry, too."
I gotta admire you for finding them at all.
You must have some Apache blood in you.
"That Silmser, he was from my own part of west Texas."
I liked the man.
I'll bet you did.
I bet you cried when you staked him out on the ground.
Here.
"Well, Tyree..."
I just don't have the inclination or the breath to offer you the water a second time.
"Friend, I could say I don't want any."
"I could say that I don't want any because if I'd have shot straight,"
I wouldn't have these...
these chains on my wrist.
Or your company.
"Just my own pleasant solitude to die in, huh?"
I could say that.
"Or I could say that... that I don't want it, because I'm too proud to be given something that, in reality,"
I'm gonna take!
You have a bad disposition... and a big mouth.
"Like I told you, I am no friend of yours."
Carson and fuckin' Carson.
"So, if any of you want to go over to Teddy's and help rearrange deck chairs for ten dollars and a sandwich, you know where the fucking door is."
Money is your fucking enemy.
"The desire for money, I get it."
"Who doesn't want something tangible for all their hard work, huh?"
"But you don't get paid until the job is done, period."
"That desire, that hunger, that's what keeps you fuckers awake!"
And raw enough to still feel the pain that delivered you to my doorstep in the first place!
"When I was a little kid, we raised chickens, hmm?"
And chicks break out of their shells.
That's what gives them their strength.
"If someone helps them, they die."
"You may think you're doing them a favor, but that struggle, that is how they survive."
"Now, that's a fucking analogy."
Fuck off.
Y'all know where I stand now.
You decide where you fucking stand.
Goldie.
You got a second?
"Oh, I am through begging you to give a shit."
[lighter clicks] [footsteps leaving] [dance music playing]
"Hey, any chance you can help me with that rewrite tonight?"
"Oh, shit."
Um...
"I can't, I...gotta fucking work at the deli."
You're a tough guy to nail down.
What's good for you?
It's just one sketch.
Um... [hums]
"I don't know, let me-- I'll just--"
I'll--I'll look at my schedule and I'll get back to you.
"You're not gonna help me, are you?"
That's not a very friendly greeting after I broke my back getting here.
"Hi, Joey."
"Say, there's a blizzard blowing up, big one."
Got a drink?
I'm froze.
"You're nowhere near froze, with all you've got in you already."
I see the Navy hasn't cured you of drinking.
Cure me!
"Honey, the Navy's taught me tricks you never heared of."
"Sure made a lot of changes around here, ain't you?"
"You bet we have, Lucas."
"And for a start, you can pick up your things and go."
Ain't nobody gonna tell me what I can't do in my own house.
- This isn't your house anymore.
- I don't care.
"This is still my place, and don't forget it."
Did you just come back here to make trouble?
"- You heard about Ma, didn't you?"
"- Yep, heard about her."
"Hey, Joey, here's a quarter."
"Run along now, huh?"
"Come on, pick it up."
"- Pick it up, Joey."
"- Lucas, you leave him alone."
"Oh, honey... ."
"No, don't start a fight."
Me and you got to know each other a little too well for that.
"Say, I didn't think you could improve, but you sure have."
"It ain't like I was your real pa, you know."
"- You dirty, filthy animal!"
"- You're still a little wildcat, ain't you!"
"As we worship together this Easter morning and more, as we pray to him who died and rose again that we might have life and have it more abundantly let us remember especially those who have gone from this country and town to live and die in far-off places for a like purpose."
You can hitch a ride down at the air base in one of them B-29s on the way to Mitchell Field in New York.
Forget about it.
Those reunions are for the birds.
"-But Sarge, you got to go."
"-What, what, b-but Sarge, but what, what?"
"I'm a master sergeant, and I got to go like a master sergeant."
"That means a suite at the Waldorf, maybe pick up the tab for those meatballs."
Where am I going to get the money-- sell a tank?
"Hey, Bilko, I got another breakdown."
Another breakdown?
You can't move without me.
"Look, if you can't get me a truck that works, get me a mule."
I'll do better than that;
I'll put a harness on you.
Get out of here.
"He don't want to go to that reunion, does he?"
"Not much, he don't."
"Man, wouldn't he like to walk in on them guys flashing them six stripes of his, huh?"
"With that room at the Waldorf, huh?"
"Show he's still the top guy in the outfit, huh?"
What a night that would be.
"Listen, Hensh, I got an idea."
"There's money in this platoon, only it went underground."
We're going to dig it up.
Give me that picture.
"Look, you go tell the other top kicks in the outfit what we need."
-On the double.
-Yo.
"All right, boys, I want to talk to you right here, on the double, let's go, everyone..."
Look at that picture again.
Look at all that hair.
"And every hair that's gone is from worrying about you guys, this whole platoon."
"It was a bit dicey there for a minute, but then they gave me a shot."
Now I'm pumped!
"Okay, Nick."
Let's see what this baby can do.
I'm way ahead of you.
"Okay, you're at nine centimeters."
"Hey, when European guys measure their penis, do they get to use centimeters?"
'Cause that would sound a lot more impressive.
"Hey, let's go easy on the penis talk down there."
"The point is, you're not quite there yet."
This is not quite there?
!
"I know this sounds hard to believe, but I think the baby has a knife!"
"Well, it is a rough neighborhood."
"Now, listen to me, baby."
What's the rush?
"The next time you're going to be anywhere near one of those things is after the bar closes, and all the good-looking guys have already gone home."
"My son is going to be very handsome, and he will be taking ladies home early and often, but he won't try anything, because that's just the kind of guy he is."
Guess who's here?
Yay!
Yay!
Where's Zack?
He and Nick left before us.
I thought he'd be here.
"I am aware that you're anxious, but I do not have a spotless driving record by accident."
It's just five more blocks.
And that is statistically when most accidents occur.
I really think Zack should be here because this thing's kicking my ass from the inside out.
"Doctor, what should we do?"
Hold her.
Talk to her.
Tell her something to distract her.
Yes.
Then you will be familiar with informationals.
"We sandwich them between the support and the main features for the public to be informed, don't have time to escape."
What to do in an air-raid?
Get under-cover at once.
Don't stand staring at the sky.
Take cover at once!
"You will find a page of script equates to a minute of screen time, or roughly 80 yards or celluloid, or... the word of directors who didn't squander the film stock as if it were lavatory paper."
"Speaking of which, ""ladies"" is last door on the left."
I wouldn't risk the other facilities if I were you.
I thought it was a Secretarial post.
For God sake!
Keep that to yourself.
This way!
This way!
This way!
What did they say!
?
The War Artist Committee?
They find my interpretations all together too brutal and dis-spirited.
You're so much better than the all the rest of them.
"All the rest of them, managed to put food on the table."
"Ellis, I had a meeting today."
About a new job.
They offered it to me. £2 a week.
You know Perry wants you to work for him.
I told him only I'm allowed to blame you.
You are me for my perspective.
No.
"They are puttin' him, cause they want you there."
Right.
I've to get to the warden's fast.
"Yeah, and I said to him, ""Come to our house, you'll see he's nice."
"""Our address..."""
And I gave him our address.
"So, I don't know if that had anything to do with it."
LAUGHTER
"Then, after that, Scotland Yard said, ""You have to take precautions now"
"""and when you leave the house,"
"""you have to look under your car to check for bombs."""
"And my dad's like, ""OK, I'm a writer, I totally know what a bomb..."""
"Unless it's round, with TNT written on it."
It's fizzing.
"So, before school, we'd all look under the car like this and my dad's going, ""I'm not a mechanic."
"""I have no idea what it's meant to look like."
"""Get in, get in."
"We'll see what happens."""
"And he'd turn the engine on, we'd be like..."
"""No, we're all right, yeah, we're cool."
"We're going to school."""
He got you in the car and then tried it.
"Yeah, yeah."
And he didn't take on any other precaution.
"After that, I thought my dad would pack up writing and go and work in a chip shop, but he never did."
So does he still get death threats?
Is he still getting...?
Only from my mother.
LAUGHTER
Matthew.
Hello.
Can you tell me about not going to see Morrissey?
Why is it significant that you didn't go to see Morrissey?
"Well, because my wife turned 30 this year, and I thought, as a nice birthday treat, we would go and see Morrissey - it's her favourite singer - in concert."
"So, we booked a holiday to Brooklyn, cos that's where he was playing."
"Bye, marcus."
Oh lord...
Thank you for my granddaughter.
"Oh please,"
Let her make a fresh start
And let it stick this time.
This whole family needs a fresh start.
And send my silly daughter home to her husband.
"Lord, if i'd have had one like him,"
I wouldn't have had to raise my girls alone.
"Well, monica, it's time for your evaluation."
"You know jack, of course, and this is mr."
Charles.
And we're just gonna evaluate you today.
"I know this can be scary, but please just try to relax."
We all want you to be able to leave the center.
We do.
We just want to be sure you can do that without coming back here.
Our main concern is where you'll be staying
If your mother won't let you back into her house.
"Well, my dad said that i could stay at his house."
He said i'm...
I'm welcome there.
"Well, that's great."
That's wonderful.
"But he travels a lot, so who's gonna be there to monitor you,"
Make sure you don't get back with the same people and end up here again?
"Yeah, that just doesn't seem too stable to me."
"I would like to hear of a better plan, for your protection."
We're just not sure that you're ready
For that much freedom yet.
I'll be fine.
So let's find it.
There was another one...
Sammy park... an overdose two years ago.
The kid was 15. here on a full scholarship.
Physics.
"Carl, the admissions director?"
He's got solid alibis.
"Yeah, he's hiding something."
And you know that how?
Five decades in uniform is how I know.
Same way I knew that you busted my car window playing ball even though you said you didn't.
I didn't bust it playing ball.
I hit it with a bat.
How the hell did you put a bat through a window playing ball?
When you do it on purpose.
[Inhales sharply] This physics prodigy... he was seeing the school therapist.
Maybe he said something in session that will help us.
You hit my Chevy on purpose.
You made Mom cry.
"If you've got a problem with a man, you go to him."
You don't take a bat to his car.
I was 8 years old.
I knew you lied about that window.
"Well, it looks like you two are in the right place."
"Exceptional people like Sammy... they're hard on themselves to begin with, and when you push them to see how far that genius can go, the stress here can be unbearable."
But he sought out treatment.
"Well, we're understaffed."
"At most, I saw him once a week."
"I mean, it wasn't enough."
"Emotionally, he was like a child."
Did he ever mention any of those names in that file there?
Did he ever mention a Kevin Whitfield?
It's real important that you let Burke guide you in court.
And you be as closed-mouthed as you can around that prosecuting attorney.
- Who is he?
- His name's Walter Stoll.
He is effective.
They say he's running for office again... and this trial will be kind of a showground for him.
"If he convicts you, he'll be a big hero."
He needs to hang you to get elected.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You could have been riding right through this two-bit town.
- People been trying to kill me all my life.
- I've got to tell you something.
I knew the Association wanted to get rid of you... because they told me.
But I just didn't know what to do.
They...
"I didn't know nothing about... the Nolt boy... or how it happened, but..."
Who the hell could have done such a thing?
But I know one thing.
You never killed that kid.
I figure folks would have to do something about me sooner or later... the frontier closed and all.
I never knew anybody that knew anything but just killing and getting killed.
"After a while, it's all you know."
"Now listen, if it all goes wrong in there for me..."
"I know you're my friend, John... and I know that you care about me."
"Now sit down, and I'll whip your ass at checkers."
Good day.
"That's fine, Tom."
"Tom, you can step up to the counsel's table here."
"Earl, back over here."
You boys split up.
The Honorable Judge Scott.
This court is now in session.
I want you to go out there and talk to them.
"I want you all to come up with something to clear this place out, okay?"
"Say something exploded, say anything you want."
"Just keep the world away from me till the FBI gets here, okay?"
"Hey, don't be stupid."
A lot of people are gonna get killed.
You can go now.
"What are you doing, Ray?"
What do you think you're gonna get done?
We live in a world that's out of our control.
You should know that better than anyone.
"I mean, things happen, right?"
"What is that, God's will?"
The hell with that.
We all feel that way sometimes--
"Spare me the couch, Dr Penzler."
I'm not a crazy person.
"I mean, things really happen to me, and I'm sick and tired of nobody believing me but you fruit loops."
What am I gonna do?
"Okay, so it's very simple."
The government is gonna come clean on national TV.
"They're gonna tell the world this is all real, and then no one... no one will ever think I'm crazy again."
Answer your question?
We do exactly what he wants.
"We clear the area, evacuate the building, keep the students and faculty safe."
"By then, the FBI will be here, and then it will all be their problem."
- Start setting up the barricades.
- Right away.
Something frightened you.
That's why you came here?
I don't really know what happened.
There were some people.
It's need-to-know.
Initiate the video conference Special Agent Gibbs requested.
Have you figured out why somebody would unbury a body?
That's need-to-know.
"You can't pull that one with me, Jethro."
I'm your boss.
"Iraq standing by, ma'am."
I got your e-mail concerning Lance Corporal Finn.
I assume you've been over his SRB.
"Yeah, we have, Skipper."
We'd like to know what's not on the record.
Finn wasn't one of my stronger Marines.
Wasn't surprised he went UA.
He have any enemies in the company?
He was well-liked.
Played poker.
What can you buy it for down there?
12 cents.
Thanks.
"Well, i'm sure glad to get out of that land of cotton."
"Come on, boys, let's go."
"No, wait a minute."
I'm thinking about that cotton.
We're suckers for running away from a fortune.
"All the cotton mills are up north, but they haven't got any cotton."
"Why, we could get all the cotton we want for 12 cents a pound and smuggle it through."
"In that way, we'd be helping the south by buying it and helping the north by selling it."
And helping ourselves to $1.88 for every pound we can lay our hands on.
Wait a minute-i ain't going back down south there for no $1.88.
"You're going up north, luke."
You're going to drive to boston as fast as you can get there and open up an office.
"Nick and me are going back to dixie, and we're gonna ship you all the cotton we can lay our hands on."
How about you?
I've just looked it over.
That's enough for me.
What's up my young bull?
What?
"If things don't go well as planned, have your immediate family... and I have my tribe, in Urfa, waiting for us."
"Oh, get out of here."
You have Candan's phone number.
You're just kidding us talking about tribes and all.
Why don't you go after women your own age just like all the other people?
I'll say this knowing Gamze won't be offended.
Our generation sucks.
How do you know.
Did you try?
"I have a bachelor dad, that's how."
"Talking about fathers, we have been using your house like a cell..."
I hope that we're not being disgraceful.
Not at all!
"I was talking about something else, here."
"There's food in the oven, Uluc."
You can warm it up and eat it.
Having a child means having problems.
But I still love him...
Candan is a totally different woman.
"I know that the answer key of the selection exam and a treble clef don't... mean the same thing to you guys, but knowing about music will make you think... systematically and will help you heal your soul."
"Sometimes, I feel like she's lecturing only me."
How did that happen?
She doesn't even know you exist.
Fine.
That's what you think.
I have her number though.
I'll now take private lessons from her.
May your enemies become unwell.
I have only one ailment.
Of telling lies.
"Mother, why did you send me false news?"
Ask yourself. lt has been so many days since I last met you.
You know how my work is.
What kind of work is this?
I will go and meet your boss.
And ask him why he makes my son work so much!
But he compensates with the money too!
To hell with such money.
"For name's sake, I have two sons."
But none of them is close to me.
One son is at the police academy.
I wonder what kind of a training he is undergoing?
He doesn't telephone for weeks altogether.
What?
He doesn't even telephone?
I will go straight to Pune and take him to task.
You don't have to do that!
As if you are always close to me!
"I might pass away, living all alone to myself."
And both of you would not even have time for the last rites.
Mother...you know that I left home for the sake of our livelihood.
"If I hadn't left home, Avi wouldn't have got what was his due and the new life."
I know.
Avi has got his due.
But what about your due?
You even gave him what was due to you.
I won't let him make merry all his life.
"I am waiting for the day when he returns from the Academy as a police officer, and start earning."
But when will you return home?

Amy:
"Previously on ""Heartland""..."
I've been feeding these horses for years and never got that close to 'em.
"Well, that's Amy for you."
You-you've got no legal right to stop me from seeing my niece!
"But it is our house, and we do have the legal right to tell you to get the hell outta here."
"I'm pushing for that cull to happen, and when it does, those damn horses are gonna be the first to go."
"- Okay, let's get 'em outta here."
- What the hell are you doing?
!
I told you not to fight me on this!
Keep 'em moving!
I'm with the child protection society.
And alcohol.
"All right, thanks, dude."
"All right, so HPD checked all the locations that Holm was surveilling, no sign of Addison."
"Okay, so this guy, he abducts Addison for a specific reason, but it's not 'cause she's young and pretty."
No.
It's because she's got something that she's hiding and this guy wants to expose her.
"Exactly, that's what he does, he prowls the Internet looking for victims who have dark secrets and then he forces them to confess 'cause... what, he's a vigilante with a god complex."
"No, this guy's face is all over the news."
"Okay, and that is why he didn't take her to any of those spots, right?"
"I mean, he's smart, he knows we'd be on 'em."
"He's smart, he's also a psychopath."
I'm not looking forward to seeing what this guy does now that his back's against the wall.
Please.
I don't want to die.
I'm not the one who's a murderer.
KONO:
This link was just posted to Addison's profile page.
It's a Web stream.
It's about to go live.
Toast?
I'm on it.
My name is Addison Wells.
"As most of you know, I was kidnapped last night."
But what you don't know is the reason why.
"For years now, Toast, talk to me."
I've been keeping a secret.
He's got the feed on a five-second relay.
It's being bounced off proxy servers all over the world.
"run from it, put it behind me, Well, can you trace it?"
but I wrong.
I could if I had a few hours.
I moved to Hawaii...
And who says there has to be one?
"There doesn't have to be one, but..."
"Harvey, first of all, you may be underestimating her."
"I mean, Donna's a big girl."
Paula...
"And second of all, if I'm wrong and you're not underestimating her, then... you're only gonna cause both of you a lot more trouble down the road when she finds out."
"'Cause, Harvey, she is gonna find out."
So you're telling me to tell her?
You already know what you need to do.
You just asked me because sometimes we need to hear it from someone else.
♪♪
♪♪
They didn't tell me you brought a sidekick.
"Frank, this is Oliver Grady."
He's the one that's trying the case.
Good for him.
I still don't know what you're doing back here.
I already told you everything I know.
Not everything.
It's time you gave us the name of your source.
Uh-uh.
"The deal is that money goes into my daughter's account, then you get the name."
What the hell is this?
It's a down payment.
Down payment?
I don't think so.
I want the whole thing.
"And if you think we're giving you half a million without a name, then you're out of your mind."
"Then we are at what they call an impasse, because I'm not giving you that name without that money."
And there isn't gonna be any money if the judge dismisses this case.
What the hell is he talking about?
He's talking about the fact that the other side filed a motion to dismiss this thing.
The show unquestionably will be a tremendous success.
"I know you expect it, but what if it isn't?"
"Well, I didn't mean any harm."
I didn't know you were interested in him.
I'm not interested in him.
But why do you do such things?
"But, my dear, I was just trying to earn a small pittance."
At somebody else's expense.
"Well, I've done the wrong thing again I suppose."
I know I haven't been much of a father to my little girl.
More or less of a reprobate I guess.
"No tragics, father, please."
"Oh, I'm an old rascal, and it's a fact."
I've been a burden to you all your life.
But it isn't to late to right matters.
I shall square everything with one magnificent gesture.
"'Though it means putting my head in the pillar, eh.'"
I shall do it.
"Father, what are you talking about?"
I'll marry the duchess.
You're not going into that duchess routine again.
"- This time, I mean it."
- She's a very nice woman.
"A little kittenish perhaps, but you'd be lucky to get her."
"But then, you wouldn't marry anyone you think too much of your freedom."
No man should ever marry a woman unless he can't do without her.
And I can do without the duchess.
So that's out.
"Well, one thing remains."
"From now on, I shall stand on my own feet."

"- $500 a day, plus expenses."
What a sweet girl.
Do you think she uses a forklift to g her hair that high?
"Before you start, Lexia's my friend."
"After Ian died, she was totally there for me."
"She doesn't really strike me as the warm, fuzzy type."
You just don't know her.
Lexia is guarded when dealing with mundanes.
Mundanes?
"You know, normals, outsiders."
You mean me.
This is why you should let me work the case with you.
"Coreen, I don't even know if there is a case."
"And if there is, ever since I got these, half of my cases are a horror show."
I don't want to drag you into it.
Excuse me?
I almost became a demon bride twice.
I had my mouth stolen by a voodoo queen.
I can handle anything that they throw at us.
"Oh, I'm sure we'll read that in the book of famous last words."
The first thing you need to do is find out about the dead guy.
I bet he's chalk full of clues.
Did you just say 'chalk full of clues'?
"I'm in, right?"
"I mean, Vicki, this is going to be so much fun."
"I don't know if I agree with your definition of fun,"
- but all right you can help.
- Yes!
"Coreen, be still, no one likes a perky Goth."
Gene Hansen is proving to be a bit of a conundrum.
We know he was last seen alive at around 4 o'clock in the morning.
But his physical condition belies that estimate.
I'm scared of the risk involved.
"Moreover, it's a TV program..."
What's the risk?
You are a cop investigating a case.
"As a TV channel, we will support you."
If everything falls in place...
We will get the content.
"And you... will get the respect and dignity from the public, that is missing at the police station."
Only you have come here.
What about the rest of the crew?
"Initially, I will read the case thoroughly."
I'll then deeply investigate it.
The crew will then arrive.
"Perumal, make a note in Sir's credit list."
Didn't the victim have any sort of ID or visiting card on him?
"Had it been there, you wouldn't have had to come here."
This is a tourist spot.
Was the victim a tourist?
Was he on an official trip?
Or he was just trespassing?
Was it a death by accident?
Or did it he commit suicide?
I have no clue.
No local person was able to identify him.
One thing is for sure.
You are real serious about this case now.
You seem to trust me.
I'll solve this case just for that.
Madam.
Take this.
'Catch if he drinks' app has been installed in it.
"If your husband drinks alcohol in a local wine shop, or anywhere else, the app will send you a text."
"I found the joker, commodore, i found it!"
What is it?
"This injunction prevents his issuing stock, but he's issuing convertible bonds and turning them into stock."
And that's what you're buying.
What?
Give me my hat!
I'm going to put the supreme court to work.
Here's another $1 million worth of stock.
"Luke, take these over to vanderbilt's brokers."
"They'll give you a bank order for them, and bring back the cash."
I don't like this job.
First man i ever seen that's afraid of carrying money.
Whoever heard of a walking bank?
I should be surrounded by steel bars and a cannon.
"Well, they might jack you for a little money, but no crook in the world has nerve enough to tackle you for a million."
There's 3 of them right in this room.
Here comes another load of it.
Let me see that!
Get back!
Get on back here!
Get back!
"Another day, another $1 million."
All the drawers are full of the stuff now- what are you going to do with that batch?
Put it in the pickle case.
"Oh-so you don't trust me, huh?"
"Oh, i trust your honesty, but not your memory."
"Excuse me, uncle daniel."
"Listen, boss, the people know that i ain't carrying eggs in that satchel."
Take a look at this.
We're going to surround our money with an army.
Says here you're a colonel in the militia.
That's right.
That's what inspired me to get it.
Really?
"No, I'm making that up."
"No matter how you dress that up, you're still pooing in a little cupboard, aren't you?"
The poo in the RV is what motivated me to sell the RV.
True story.
"First day of filming Storage Hunters, right, very first day, back in the States, I'm all excited, wake up early, my wife and I..."
We were living in the RV at the time.
We drive the RV to our TV show.
"Rare that you're living in a van and you have a TV show, and getting out of the parking lot, it gets wedged between two poles, stuck."
I had to go find someone to cut the pole down.
That took a while.
Then we get to the set and they decide it would be great to film inside.
One of the cameramen bumped the stove.
We left.
We didn't realise he'd bumped the stove and turned the gas on.
The RV filled up with gas.
"I come back to change my clothes, I smell the gas."
Luckily the heater hadn't kicked on.
"Opened all the doors, shut the stove off, right?"
Thank God
- I saved it from blowing up.
"I extend the bedroom out, cos you do with these extensions, where you hit a button and it goes out, right?"
"Go in, get my clothes out of the closet."
"It's cool, right?"
"I change my clothes, I go back, we do some more filming."
"That afternoon, after about 10 hours of filming, we get in our car, three-hour ride home."
On the freeway everyone is honking at me.
"I'm just giving them, ""It's big, it's slow"
- I get it.
"Go round!"""
That's not why they were honking.
Is the list of receivers ready?
Ready sir.
I must distribute these funds.
Ensure win the election.
They must make me the next CM.
Something is happening.
"Whatever you do with this money, it'll be wonders only."
"Already had enough of wonders happening, you forced us to take all our money to abroad, a local Indian took it away, we had our balls crushed."
Take it sportively son.
"Didn't I tell you, I'll know all your movements."
Just half an hour to strike noon!
Will you do it on time as you promised?
I want to see it happen.
Come.
"Going to steal with a police officer, that's really a great kick!"
Are you still confident of stealing money?
What exactly is your plan?
Would I tell you?
Can you become a friend by sitting next to me?
"No, you're a police officer and I'm a thief."
"There are 300 police men in the office, you can't even step in there."
"If you dare to go, one round of fire is enough to shred your body."
"I'll go to loo and come, it's very urgent."
"Trust me, if you've any doubt, come with me."
Go.
Is my new get up nice?
Only you know my real face.
"Others mustn't know it, that's why."
"I've a doubt, I think you're taking revenge on me for that girl."
You're important to me not that girl.
"Okay, it's time, let's go."
What are you looking at?
- it doesn't mean she can't be as ruthless as the rest of us.
- Governor?
You ever stabbed a man in the navel?
You?
Me?
"No, I haven't."
"Stab a man in the navel, and that's all she wrote."
"Bleeding is so swift and severe, it wouldn't matter if Jesus put His healing hand on the wound... the bastard is dead."
We have to gut the bitch in the belly.
"We all have to understand, we're going to obliterate her life... but it will get you the vice presidency."
"- Hey, Dog!"
"- Lewis, how you doin'?"
"Wow, that's a plate of food!"
You didn't have to dress up for me.
I had to accompany the senator to the Gridiron Lunch.
"If John Q. Public could see the money that the knuckleheads that run this country... spend on these lunches, there would be a second revolution."
"I'm telling you, there is some money spent on these stupid lunches."
- What is this?
- It's the reason you're here.
You can't let anybody know where you got this from.
"If Runyon found out I gave this to you... he'd fire me, and I don't want him as an enemy."
That's Lainey Hanson getting gang-banged.
Looks like something out of Hustler.
That's her for sure.
I know it's hard to tell with her...
"her face in someone's crotch... but that's her, man."
Why are you showing me this?
I will not be party to an ambush.
"Why are you showing me this, Ted?"
Okay.
I want out of Runyon's office.
And I thought maybe you could get me on staff...
Everything ok?
-Can you feel it?
"The fresh air, birds singing, the ocean, the bushes down there."
"-This is good for you, it is so nice out here."
"-It's nice in the city too, right Gustaf?"
-It really isn't.
Just imagine the amount of time you'll have to fix the house now that you're single.
"-Don't worry about the house right now, it'll work itself out"
"He's not single, they haven't separated yet."
"You're just on a little break, right?"
"-But still, break is fake."
"-The fact is it's routine, slow and steady."
"Just like you like it, dad."
-Can I talk to you real quick?
-It's like a dream.
It doesn't get any better than this.
- But that first time.
"- That first... well, that first... I think it's lasted till now."
Just the objects have probably changed.
But I'm still as keen.
"We have a new student, who I should like to welcome and I hope she will enjoy being with us to the end of the school year."
"Well, go to the blackboard."
Sit down!
Sit next to Marcel!
"He's calling her, isn't he?"
"Marcel, why did you want me to sit next to you?"
"I thought, I have to explain, when something comes up... I say something, so I sit alone, so we have a chance to laugh..."
Why do they laugh at you?
"I'm known for my remarks, they make everyone laugh."
I've heard you broke a plate and bumped into a cook.
"They were pushing, the plate fell and the cook ran for the deputy head."
I quickly picked up the bits...
"At the hospital when I was half naked, she hugged me and was all like ""Yoon Jae, I thought you were dead!"" and stuff."
That was because I didn't have a chance.
I didn't even get to see it clearly.
Oh my god!
"So you and Yoon Jae weren't even close enough to have seen each other and stuff, huh?"
The wedding is a month away and you still haven't done anything.
Is that something a kid should be saying?
Go get the other things you need.
Teacher Gil.
Do you want me to show you?
This ahjussi's body is great.
Take a look.
This physique can't be achieved in one or two months.
"Look, there are even chocolate abs!"
Stop it!
"Ohh, that's strange."
Why didn't this person show you his worked-out body?
"It was so well-made, I thought it was to show you."
Yoon Jae is really energetic so he likes to work out.
That's right!
He needs to be really energetic and work on it at least 2 hours a day to get this body!
"If it's like that, then do you really have to set aside 2 hours a day just to exercise?"
Without a doubt.
"During that time, he could have met you."
He claims to be busy at work but can find the time to exercise.
It seems like he likes his abs better than you.
"He always said he was busy, but I guess he had time for exercise."
"So, whenever he said he was busy and out of time, was it all just an excuse?"
Did he just not want to meet me?
What do you mean he didn't want to meet you?
That day he was going to come meet you!
"He said he was meeting you to tell you something, too!"
"For stealing a pornographic book and I'd confessed to her that I'd never been with anyone and she said, ""You've got two options."""
"And I don't know why, it was an American voice, she went,"
"""You can either go before a judge or this."""
How many years did that serve you for?
We had a good eight-month relationship.
"Right, so one night, I'm in a bit of a rush and I'd kind of got myself geared up and I'd already put myself through the judicial system."
I'd already met my lawyer.
I was really thorough.
"I really like to flesh the story out, so I'd met my lawyer."
They told me that she was going to give evidence.
"She'd come in the cell, she'd talk to me."
It would happen.
"On this one, you're going, right, just get ready for the..."
"So I'm...trousers down and I'm ready to sort of go,"
"""I'm a bad person."
"I deserve everything I get."""
I put my hand in and pull it out...
The magazine.
Yeah.
What would I be...?
"No, hey!"
"When I pull out, in the meantime, what I didn't know was that my dad had caught on to me running the taps slow and taking a long time to have a bath."
So I'm lying there on the bathroom floor with my penis in my hand and I pull out a Catholic newsletter.
He'd swapped it.
"Just as I'm at the point of no return,"
I pull out a picture of Our Lady.
"You can imagine the kind of ""Argh!"""
What scenario did you have to invent for this?
She's a super lawyer from the DS.
You could tell it wasn't really Our Lady.
It was...
"Everybody comes into that age, you know what I mean?"
You guys get it.
You guys are hip.
You're cool.
You get it.
"I'm one of those people that doesn't believe in global warming, but I'm pretty sure Noah's ark was a true story."
"Where the guy was warning everybody about the insane change in the weather, and everyone's like, ""Shut the fuck up, Noah."
Quit hogging' all the wood so you can go off and fuck those animals.
"Well, that's what it looks like."
"That's what it looks like to us, dude."
Looks like you're building some kind of sex ship out there.
"If that's not the case, you need to come down to the pub, and you need to give a speech, 'cause people are talking, dude."
People are fuckin' talkin'.
We don't know you.
We don't know you.
"People are chatting', dude."
You're like a thousand.
"No one else is a thousand."""
"On the topic of guns, not everyone here likes guns."
Not everyone here hates guns.
Maybe some guns shouldn't be available.
"But what we do know for a fact is that right now, all of the guns are currently available."
And some people are collecting guns.
"And some people are picking flowers, hoping it all goes away one day."
"I assure you, it is not going to go away."
"You've been led to believe at some point, it's gonna be us versus them."
"We just don't know who ""them"" is."
"But in reality, it's gonna be red versus blue, and it's gonna be a fuckin' bloodbath."
So while guns are currently available... consider having a few around.
"You know, for when the shit hits the fan."
"You don't want people barging in in your house and you're like, ""I got a ton of steak knives!"""
"I told my wife, ""I think we should get a gun."""
"She was like, ""Why do we need a gun?"""
5 more!
GO!

"Well done boys, yes!"
"Okay, let's get moving boys, get moving."
Move move move

"Okay let's go both hands, both hands, go"
"Louis - ""Oh, my legs."
"My back!"""
"Well done lads, heads up."
"Breathe, open the lungs"
"Here we go, let's start to clean it up."
Make sure the blades are buried.
Ready?
Go.

Yes sir?
When did you meet Ji-hwan?
Um...
It was during 2nd grade... over ten years already!
"Dal-rae, Can I ask you a favor?"
"Yes, of course."
Actually...
I thought of a novel seeing you and Ji-hwan
And?
Stories of you two may be helpful.
They're not that interesting.
"So why don't start? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;When he was young Ji-hwan was often ignored.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;He's now a rascal but then a quiet kid who'd fight a lot&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;so other kids avoided him a lot.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;As your teacher, I want to know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;more about my loving students.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"

Did you see them?
The drawings all over.
You have runny nose.
"Here, wipe it off."
"Keep it, or throw it away."
Thanks.
Got something for you too.
It's not coming out...
Oh god.
Smells awful.
"Uninteresting, right?"
This is a great topic.
Became friends while removing scribbles.
But... who could that been?
Scribbling high up like that...
"-You scared us... 929 01:16:20,547 --&amp;gt; 01:16:22,697 I was scared too."
"930 01:16:31,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:34,800 Dad, please just a second."
"931 01:16:34,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:38,148 How are the preparations going?"
"932 01:16:38,148 --&amp;gt; 01:16:42,831 Don't ask from me something I can't do Mert 933 01:16:42,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:47,500 Dad, please don't send Yaman like this."
"If you love me, let him stay here a night more please!"
"934 01:16:47,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:50,900 You will come without being late, right?"
"935 01:16:50,900 --&amp;gt; 01:16:56,500 Your guest can come too, please!"
"By the way, I am Mira."
Hello!

"938 01:17:02,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:07,600 Is that so?"
Very pleased to meet you.- Me too.
"939 01:17:07,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:13,500 What a beautiful name you have, just like you... 940 01:17:13,600 --&amp;gt; 01:17:15,273 Thank you.- Mira!"
"941 01:17:15,300 --&amp;gt; 01:17:19,100 Come on Safari, sweet."
"Err he escaped again 942 01:17:19,200 --&amp;gt; 01:17:23,400 I came to see where were you but... 943 01:17:23,500 --&amp;gt; 01:17:27,500 I see that the problem still continues here ."
"944 01:17:30,504 --&amp;gt; 01:17:37,199 No, the problem isn't continuing."
To the contrary we're celebrating that we returned from a mistake dear Sude.
"945 01:17:39,800 --&amp;gt; 01:17:45,900 Don't worry, we will be at the fair together with our guests a little after"
"946 01:17:48,100 --&amp;gt; 01:17:49,516 What fair?"
"947 01:17:49,516 --&amp;gt; 01:17:54,980 The foundation where my wife's dad is president is celebrating his 80th anniversary."
"948 01:17:54,980 --&amp;gt; 01:17:57,890 and tonight there is an aid night."
Everyone will be there.

-We will talk with you later!

"957 01:18:33,700 --&amp;gt; 01:18:36,334 Mr. Selim ,really we need to leave."
"958 01:18:36,334 --&amp;gt; 01:18:39,800 But look, if you go like this it will be like escaping as guilty, 959 01:18:39,915 --&amp;gt; 01:18:44,962 but if we go there as a whole family, all of us they will understand that all accuses are lies, 960 01:18:45,000 --&amp;gt; 01:18:48,100 and those who were up to something behind your back will be up a gum tree(surprised)."
"961 01:18:50,588 --&amp;gt; 01:18:55,066 If I were you I wouldn't let Mert down.- I love you."

"Okay, I worked for Pioneer"
"Hybrid International, out of Adair, illinois."
I worked under plant breeder Dr. Mark Hoffback.
And I reported to Bruce Edson.
He's a senior research associate for Pioneer.
And my project was related with nitrogen-use efficiency corn hybrids.
"The field that I worked with was flooded out not once, not twice, but three times."
And if you there today there is only soybeans that high.
"In other words, we had to contact other research stations around the Midwest and go"
[Text on screen:
"Josh, student intern]: to their nitrogen-use efficiency plots and collect our data."
"So I went to Marion, Iowa; Princeton, illinois; and Johnston, Iowa, which is Pioneer's world headquarters."
And I collected my data from their locations.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
So what would you say is the most exciting thing about your internship this summer?
Josh:
"The most exciting thing was to work with very smart, intelligent people that know a lot about the maize or the corn crop."
"And most of all, their passion about it."
They really
like what they do.
And it made me like what I do.
Learning from those people is worth more than the paycheck every week.
"Or most importantly meeting those people for down the road future references, for possibly a job after graduation."
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
Thanks a lot for talking with us.
Beth Seaton:

So two years ago today
"February 11, 2006 my partner, Juan Montealegre died in Miami"
"For those who were listening to Yeast Radio at the time will recall the entire ordeal and the memorial service is on Yeast Radio in complete unedited form if you go to somewhere around February 15th or 14th, 2006 the funeral was on February 14th, 2006"
"I want to show you something, though which is the point of this video"
"This is Juan's death certificate now I've crossed out the parts that I don't want to show because they are, you know, irrelevant, relatives, Social Security, that kind of thing and I've highlighted things I want to show you"
"Now, keep in mind that first of all, if you've listened to Yeast Radio you'll know that I was"
Juan's sole caretaker when he was sick and I had to deal care of all matters of significance and I was his partner and we were planning to come here to Chicago on Feburary 1st 2006 and he died shortly after that
"Needless to say, he was unable to come up here"
I say that just as evidence of our partnership together.
Plus we had already had a business - started a business together - a hair salon
So here is what I want to show you.
Its new administrative authority is being hailed by many as a model for greater grassroots democracy in China.
I am an Accounting major.
I am a Nursing major.
Civil Engineering.
Biology.
I study Communications.
Psychology.
I study Marine Biology.
Pharmacy.
I'm a Communications major.
Education.
"I'm a Sophomore, and I'm a Bio major."
I want to be an Archaeologist.
There's a very broad range of disciplines and fields of study that are offered here.
Over eighty different majors to choose from.
I am studying Medical Laboratory Sciences.
I want to be an event planner.
I'm and Education major.
Criminal Justice.
I think employers now are looking for people who are well rounded and who are thinking globally.
They're one of the only schools that has an I.E.P. program.
It stands for the International Engineering Program.
It's a great opportunity to be able to go overseas.
I'm studying abroad next year.
The classes are awesome.
The faculty is excellent.
I love all of my professors.
It's pretty easy for the professors to keep in touch with the students.
Of course we make ourselves accessible.
"If you have a question, you can always contact them through mechanisms like the online learning system ""sakai"", through emails, through chat."
They really care about their students which is great.
"Feride ,If you can stayand give you support."
"No need for that ,Turgut ."
I Will do the in your caseMrs.
Judge?
What a fate !
"Mr. Erda , please the defendant should not speakwithout permission!"
Let's start with the procedure .
With your permission .
Do you want to say somethingin defense of your client ?
Ma'am .
"Judge , defendantaddress is known ."
"Accepts all chargesand admits that he forged official documentsand is fully prepared accessed all hearings,for that matter please defendant Mahir Kara wos brought to trial,but not in a prison."
"Mr. Erdal against the accused Mahir Kare was not only raised the accusation for false identity you will judge him, because of fraud too."
He was also chargedthat is included in the job of weapons smuggling .
Mr. Mahir stoletruck full of bullets!
But I ..
Mr. Mahir !were you that nighton the scene?
Mrs. Judge did read fileI gave you .
Prosecutor Turgut was trying to set me upand cover up his dirty work .
"If you continue with these accusations ,I will raise charges against youfor false accusations and humiliation of the Court"
and you will have to dealthe third case.
Is there any eyewitnesseswho sawthe scene that night ?
"Then someone accused Bulent Tyrjaki ,Your brother in law , and a case full of bulletswas found in his shop ."
It's a trap !
"And you can have a dossierand your brother in law too ,filled with charge!"
"All fabricated lies, ma'am."
Judge !
"We reject all allegationsand declare that we are not guilty ,Mrs. Judge ."
I thought you came to meand said that you werethere that night ? is that correct ?
Have you beenon the sceneor not ?
"Yeah , I was , but .."
I wasfor a good cause .
available today in US English and they're coming pretty soon in many other languages.
I hope you enjoy that.
Let's talk about another Cloud Computing Application; this is one of my favorite demonstrations.
"It's called Google Translate, which Eric called summation earlier."
"So the Google Translate App that's available today from Google Apps in the Android Market, allows you to type or even speak a phrase in one language, and then have it immediately translated and even spoken back to you in one of 50 other languages."
So that's pretty cool and you can try it out.
But what I want to do today is I actually want to show you a preview of a feature that we've been working on for a little while--it won't be out for a few months--it's called Conversation Mode in Google Translate.
"And for that, I'm going to invite my colleague Kyle over back on stage to help me out."
"Please keep in mind this is experimental, so it may or may not work perfectly."
"Nice to see you, Kyle. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
Were going to be in Germany in a second. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Hold on, it says French. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:"
We're in Germany. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"So--I know, yes, so Kyle, I'm a tourist and you're a salesman at a local shoe store here in Berlin."
"So we're going to start conversation mode here, and you'll notice that I have a button in English and you have a button in German."
"So, our conversation would probably go something like this."
Do you have these shoes in size 41? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try that again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Try it again. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Which cable? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; What color? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Black or Brown would be fine. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; We have black and brown. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Can you give me a discount if I take both? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
[SPEAKlNG IN FORElGN LANGUAGE] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Twenty percent. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
Sold. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KYLE:
"That's a deal, that's a deal. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
Vielen Dank. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
That--this really is history because for 50 years people have talked about being able to do what you just demoed. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
[INDlSTlNCT].
A function allows us to do that.
Expressions and statements don't do that because they just get done at 1 time when they're executed.
Functions allow us to package up computation that we want to do later.
"Hi,Lee"
"Sup,Vovan"
"Lee ,you're one eyed Pterodactyl"
And I was riding on you
And you're an goat
"So, what do you want from me"
I ...
I insulted you
And you should be upset
And I beat you!
LOL
I'm bad!
I came to one simple conclusion
Insults are only hints who is the offender and not much more
"Well, suppose if you analyze what Volodya said about me"
First.
I'm one eyed Pterodactyl...
"First of all.It's a obvious lie,and inconsistencies"
And as a our friend suggests us
I have two eyes and I'm a human
"Second of all,my system of values does not see anything wrong with one eyed Pterodactyls and even if it saw something wrong with it"
I I know anyway that I'm not a Pterodactyl
I think
It also refers to Volodya allegedly riding on me
Did not happen and that I'm am an goat
"I'm not a goat ,and there nothing wrong with goats"
"Put in Volodya sentence harsher words, witch you will not hear on our show"
But you can hear everyday in the neighborhood and nothing will change
"Insults are fantasy, fears and complexes of the offender all and nothing more"
So that's the picture for a two by two system.
"And if the right-hand side B happened to be twelve seven,"
then of course the correct solution would be one two.
Okay.
"So let me come back next time to a systematic way,"
"using elimination, to find the solution, if there is one,"
"to a system of any size and find out -- because if elimination fails,"
find out when there isn't a solution.
"Okay, thanks."

The Master-Slave dialectic sets out the origen of history.
How did history begin?
Perhaps no one ever asked himself this but the beginning of history is the beginning of human relations
"For Hegel, history began when two wills clashed, two desiring wills"
First let's differentiate between the human will and the animal will
The human will seeks other wills.
To wit: the will of one man seeks the will of another
That is: he desires that the other recognize him ...that he recognize him as the superior. ..that he submits.
So that I seek the will of the other.
I want the other to recognize me and submit to me.
And I'm going to constitute myself when this happens
The relationship that is going to be established between the other and myself
But at first the man seeks wills.
The animal seeks things and the things that it seeks it usually eats.
It desires natural things.
But man doesn't seek natural things
The consciousness is desire.
"Monsieur, c'est dommage"
"We met earlier tonight at the party, Dali, si?"
Yes
Dali!

Dali!
Thank you

You like the shape of the rhinoceros?
The rhinoceros?
"Uhh, I havent really thought about it"
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
"One more stupid love song I'll be sick [blah, pause]"
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone
"Baby it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two?"
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of it
One more stupid love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone...
Gimme a sip of vodka!
Gimme vodka!
Saturday night and there's vodka on the table
"Krycha drinks with us, Zuzia drinks too"
Zuzia looks at me smiling wide
We're drinking vodka hard!!!
"So here it is, when it's saturday"
From the evening we pour vodka and then eat pickles
"Both - Martin Luther King, a baptist pastor -"
"- and Ku Klux Klan, movement led by white people, protestants in the USA. -"
"And so, you will find the catholic church, with a moral, well, it is a conservative society."
"Like, the prohibition of marriage to the priest."
To forbid the use of condoms.
"And you might find too the episcopal church, in the USA, the anglican church in the USA, that allows gays pastors."
They live in union with those pastors.
There are specific denominations for homosexuals.
Like a contemporary church in Rio.
A few brothers here have heard of that church.
There is the metropolitan church too.
Those are communities to the homosexuals.
You might find people with totally different opinions.
There is no way you can join them.
As an example:
Obama and Bush.
Both are christians.
Obama was a member of the United Church of Christ.
A tradicional denomination in the USA.
I don't know if until today.
"Spiritualistic, catholics, protestants, mormons, Yehovah-witnesses, all of them declares themselves christians."
And there are many other groups!
"But...Well, everybody seems to be christian, huh?"
"So, depending on what christian is, in the head of a person,"
Jesus really doesn't want christians.
What christian means?
What the word christian is?
"If you search for the origin of that word, it arises in the city of Antioch."
"Before that, the church of Jerusalem, the church of Judea, was serving the Lord."
Then came the persecution.
"They had to flee and establish in Antioch, Syria."
"And there, it was the first time the disciples were called ""christians""."
"There are so many different countries, I don't know, where should I go?"
He said Italy?
"Never go there, it's no good."
The Italians are as false as the Chinese.
"Everything depends on sympathy, if you sing well or not doesn't count."
The teacher sais about France:
"France is super, everybody wants to go there."
"Paris is an excellent city, but when your no genius, you don't have a chance to get in there."
Then he gave me a good advice:
Germany is the best.
Why is Germany so good?
In Germany there are theatres everywhere.
Also in the small towns.
Therefore you build your career from place to place with endurance and passion.
In the end you can stand on the big stage in Bayreuth.
"And in Germany, the teacher said, there is an important difference:"
In Germany the north is more liberal than the south.
Therefore I wanted to go to Berlin.
I then asked everybody who is concerned with Somalia for advice.
"Wolrd Hunger Aid, journalists in Africa, UN, foreign ministry, everyone said the same: don't go there, it's too dangerous."
"But then I found out, that noone I spoke with was in Somalia in the last years."
Everything I found out was only hearsay.
"Entrance examination in Berlin, the next is Bee Chang from Taiwan, with an aria by Rossini:"
Semiramide.
Semiramide by Rossini.
This is really very beautiful.
Wonderful.
But I think you really can't sing Rossini this way.
"This was the sentence that the professors in Berlin said to Bee, when they rejected her."
This european way of singing turned into a legend for Bee.
She later sang a concert in a church in Germany and found out: there's also something about the architecture.
My voice sounded just as the voices on the european CDs that I was always listening to in Taiwan.
"Separated regions fight about borderlines, are reigned by different clans."
Some of them seek independence.
One could claim that the breakup of the state is related to the destruction of the National Theater.
Most of you will know the movie Black Hawk Down by Ridley Scott.
In one scene the US-pilots are flying over Mogadishu.
Their mission is to destroy the arsenal in the National Theater.
Ever since the theater has no roof.
"Only these metal bars are left as you see here,"
"And everybody is sitting under the open sky, as in ancient greek theaters."
Liu Xenfang is standing behind me.
"He is from Hongkong, about 55 years old,"
And he worked as a young man at the construction site of the National Theater in Somalia.
"When I'm standing in this picture, I always think:"
Please give the Peace Nobel Prize to this human being!
I showed him the picture once and told him what I think.
"Lui, Peace Nobel Prize?"
"He laughed at me and said, the only Chinese that got the Peace Nobel Prize, was a provocation of the West."
Liu how are the real human rights conditions in China?
"Well, China is ok, much more stable, than other countries."
"But, Liu, stability and human rights have no bearing on each other."
"Well, I think it has."
"Liu, China is the state with the most executions."
"You know, in some occasions, politics must kill the people."
"China is such a big country, it's hard to establish discipline, but you need it."
"When the construction of the theater was finished, Liu stayed in Africa."
"Now he runs a shop here in Nairobi, where he sells lots of different things."
"Plastic bags, clothes, mobile phones, akkus, shoes and so forth."
"There is one bestseller, which is this: a multi-band radio."
With slack joint.
"This is Ahmed, a friend of mine, from Somalia."
"He was born in Bonn, Germany, maybe he is not somali."
We studied together in Berlin.
I'm gravely concerned that it might become public works project involving concessions.
We don't have the luxury to spare a single second considering the financial condition of the Japanese government.
We must figure out how we really do the decontamination work.
"What on earth is the Diet doing, when 70,000 people are forced out of their homes and wandering?"
That's all.

I've come to set the record straight
I've come to set the record straight
From scientific propagation of the species
"To poets and philosophers, your Baudelaires and Nietzsches"
I've come to set the record straight
I've come to set the record straight

Well this isn't hieroglyphics
If you want to know sincerely
"Listen up, I'll tell you clearly"
What I like about you is...
Candace:
"So, you were saying...?"
Jeremy:
"Oh, yeah:"
I've come to set the record straight
I see you still don't get it
But you really shouldn't sweat it
I'll say one more time with feeling
Here's the reason you're appealing
What I like about you is...
What I like about you is...
What I like about you is...
I wanted to take a year of your life to give back to a positive cause in a real world setting.
"Pennycress is a winter annual, and the seeds contain a very high oil percent."
"This crop is easily grown and harvested, with minimal affect on soybean production."
"And Terry concluded that if pennycress was planted in all soybean fields, off season, at 1,000 pounds per acre yield, it could produce about 3.8 billion gallons of additional bio-diesel."
And the remaining meal can also be used as an organic fertilizer and natural weed killer for
"low-acreage, high-value crops."
It's also a source of monomer for bio-based plastics.
Beth Seaton:
Hi Hannah.
Tell me a little bit about your internship this summer with Dr. Phippen.
I understand you were working on his US Department of Agriculture grant?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I got to work at the University of illinois at Urbana-Champaign"
[Text on screen:
"Hannah, UlUC] with small grains."
So wheat and oats.
And I got to do a lot of data collection on trying to find the best variety of wheat and oats.
And lots of work out the field.
Beth Seaton:
So are you a student at the University of illinois?
Hannah:
"Yeah, I'll be transferring there in the fall."
So I'll be a junior in the fall.
Beth Seaton:
That's great.
So what kind of advice would you give to anybody who is considering this sort of agricultural internship?
Hannah:
"I would say, definitely go for it."
"Because, I didn't know anything before"
I started it.
I got to learn a lot about different crops and
I got to get some hands-on experience before I started in the fall.

Dealing with an eye injury is probably one of the most scary things for people to deal with.
"Often people don't like touching the eyes, don't like seeing any problems with them."
Even things like watching people put contact lenses in the eye can feel quite bad.
"Also, one of the senses you'd least like to lose is your sight."
So somebody with any eye injury is gonna be very very scared.
Now you can damage your eye through different things.
"Maybe just a bit of dirt or grime in the eye, maybe a scratch, maybe an impaled object into the eye."
"Also got chemicals, and things like this can all do damage."
"All right, both teams did a good job."
"Paul, Lee, go ahead and finish up your campsite."

"I know it's been a long day, but don't get too comfortable because we've got some guests coming tonight."
Children:
"We are Cub Scouts, tried and true."
We...
NARRATOR:
Think I hear them coming.
Children: ...are Cub Scouts tougher than you.
I don't want to be involved in this anymore.
"Believe me, I wouldn't ask you this if there was any other solution."
"How could you believe that this is the only solution, Yasar?"
Enough...
Stop reminding Mustafa of Narin anymore.
Isn't everybody trying to make Mustafa forget her and get out of the hospital?
"If my brother forgets Narin, he will also forget himself."
"I thought like you, I wanted him to forget Narin..."
"But, he is my brother."
"When we take Narin out of him, we see that there is nothing left."
"And, you will see it as well."
You will understand.
It is true that we gave Mustafa Bulut high dosage medicine.
But this can't be the only reason for him shutting himself off and not remembering anybody.
He refuses to eat and take a test.
"In fact, he is aware of everything."
What he went through and being here affect his situation as well.
"For every patient in this kind of situation, there is a circumstance that initiates the healing period."
A constant that attaches him to the life.
- What can it be?
- It can be anything.
"Something he hid in the deepest corner of his mind, something he didn't share with anybody,"
Something that he would never give up even though he could give up on everything else
An object...
A memory...
A person...
We honorably succeeded in every war within 10 years.
"In 10 years, we created 15 million young people at every age..."

I will go!
Injured Jun officer volunteered to take the captain's place in the plan.
"The captain was unable to stop him, and with the words ""Please look after my son"", Jun ran to the enemies will it get better if I sleep?"
It is frightening to go to sleep
Endless darkness.
Dawn that never comes
Will it get better if I sleep?
It is frightening to sleep
Endless darkness.
Dawn that never comes
"With the death of Jun officer, the captain feels agony from the fact that wars require sacrifices"
Are you kidding?

Hi!
Today I am going to talk about how to create this effect; this infinite white background.
If you saw the Apple commercials;
"Some Pokémon in the anime are just MONSTROUS, such as Dragonite and Tentacruel who are roughly the size of a BUlLDlNG!"
"While these Pokémon are clearly meant to give the idea that some of these monsters have the potential to become massive, it is interesting that, on the flipside, most of Game Freak's official sizes are much smaller than what you'd expect."
Let's get back to Charizard.
"In the anime, Ash's Charizard is actually a runt compared to others, but he's still big enough to give Ash a lift with plenty of space."
"But in the games, Charizard stands at just 5 foot 7 inches and just under 200 pounds."
"At 10 years old, Ash Ketchum is probably around 4 foot 3 inches, 70 pounds."
So I can believe that Charizard is still flyable at the average size of a child.
"But, a big adult like me?"
We wouldn't be flying anywhere.
The simple fact that Charizard and I can step on a scale and weigh the same is just it's just weird. . .I weigh a Charizard.
It just doesn't sound right.
But Charizard isn't the only Pokemon with a size you wouldn't expect.
Let's take a look at some of my favorites.
Nidoking and Nidoqueen are both a little over 4 feet tall.
"By the time you hit your teenage years, you'll probably already be taller than them."
Yeah. . .
"When you start picturing them like this, they're just not nearly as cool."
"And speaking of Pokémon much smaller than you think,"
"Rosalia, who's usually pictured to be around a couple feet tall, is just one."
Yeah.
It's just tiny.
It does look hilarious in colosseum though.
"Also, I get that Joltik is a bug but- 4 inches?"
He'd fit in the palm of your hand!
"At a size that small, it's pretty unbelievable that he'd ever be able to battle with well, ANYTHlNG else."
"Also joining Joltik is the recently announced, 6th generation Pokémon, Flabébé."
"Not only does it tie for the smallest size at 4 inches, but also the lightest weight too at 0.2 pounds."
"With Pokémon this small, what do you even need pokeballs for?"
"But when you look at Dunsparse, what do you think?"
I usually picture a little snake.
Just look at the guy in
Mystery Dungeon.
They are anti-White.
They are NOT against racism.
They are against the continued existence of all White people and only White people.

"All right, so on Monday, we spoke with Shirley Phelps-Roper about allegations that the internet gathering known as Anonymous had issued a threat, and Westboro Baptist Church responded to that threat."
"Well, today we have everybody here, we have Shirley Phelps-Roper from the Westboro Baptist Church."
"We have a source within Anonymous, the internet gathering known as Anonymous, here."
So let's start at the very beginning.
"Anonymous, can you please tell us, did any active Anonymous members or participants, sources, issue a threat to the Westboro Baptist Church?"
"-No, there was no talk of it."
"The press release was... -Well, how could you know this?"
I was wondering...
"-Well, hold on, Shirley, let's get him to explain... -They're anonymous!"
I'm just saying.
-Let's have him explain.
"-Well, Shirley, with most operations, we have planning, we have execution, we have discussion of it."
"This press release came out of nowhere, and it doesn't seem like the writing style we'd make."
"Nobody that usually writes press releases stood up and said hey, we wrote this."
"The operation came out of nowhere, and you guys responded really too fast."
It was all a bit suspicious.
"-Oh, yikes!"
It was several days before we responded.
"-So Shirley, let's..."
let's take it one at a time.
"How did you originally hear of the threat, Shirley?"
By many emails.
"We received many emails, and then, how else?"
"Oh, also in some print publications."
"Twitter, Twitter was talking about it."
"Oh, and Twitter was sending us links to it, also."
"OK, so Anonymous, can you state... do you, what is your belief?"
Do you believe that the Westboro Baptist Church concocted this letter?
I read in my neurology book... ...and there was only one similar disease.
I realized this might be a totally new disease.
I was so scared.
I was scared to death.
Your first thought is that you might get infected yourself.
"You examine sick people, thinking only of yourself."
I had to take a deep breath and tell myself that this was my job.
I examined 30 people and it was an epidemic.
When I got home I sent Agneta and the kids away.
They went to friends' houses and those of us who had met the patients stayed in our house.
After two weeks we were sure that the disease was only in the country.
It was a combination of malnutrition and toxicity - nothing contagious.
Those were two scary weeks.
"Konzo was caused by cassava roots, the only food that survived drought."
"The root contains toxic cyanide, which takes time to remove."
But people were too hungry.
They ate it immediately and were paralyzed.
My scientific articles are in the two bottom drawers...
The disease was called konzo and turned into a research project with a hundred published articles.
"In Sweden, Hans Rosling was bothered by the worldview he met."
Particularly about Africa.
"When your worldview differs so much from reality, facts are interesting."
"If you think Indian women have six or seven children and you learn the average is 2.7, that's interesting."
There have been huge changes.
Child mortality in Egypt is fairly well documented.
25 years ago 20% of children in Egypt died before age five.
Today it's 4%.
From 20 to 4.
A dramatic improvement.
Child health in Egypt has improved faster than it ever did here.
But no one knows that.
Do our news report on the fantastic improvement in child health in Egypt?
"Yeah, that's the way I do it, [laughter] it seems to work fairly reliably."
[Coordinator]
"Um, there's a, hang ...There's another question from the phone."
Go ahead.
[indecipherable question]
[Coordinator]
So let me start with that.
"So if you're in a meeting and you're taking notes, ... and you either have voice over off and your headphones on...okay continue with the question."
[Teleconference caller]
That's my question.
[Coordinator]
"That, So your question is, ""When you're in a meeting taking notes, which option do you use""?"
"Or, do you need voice over off when you have your headphones on?"
Do you guys understand the question?
[Panelist]
You definitely need voice over on.
Voice over will work fine with head phones.
[lower tone]
I think that's what she was asking?
[Coordinator]
So Is your quest....is the answer you have voice over on when you have headphones on the answer to your question?
long pause.....[teleconference caller]
"Uh...Yeah, I guess it is."
[undecipherable conversation between two teleconference callers]
You would have to wear your headset otherwise [undecipherable]
[Coordinator]
"If I understand the question correctly, as a Skype user, ah, in setting up whether or not you're going to use the computer's built-in microphone and speaker ah, that is an option that needs to be selected."
"If you're going to use a headset, look forward to the option of listening through the computer speaker the headset speaker, and speaking into the mic."
Does that answer your question?
[Teleconference caller]
Yes.
[Phone coordinator]
"And, we could see this with a poll, or we could see this with tech."
"We had a lot of benefits in the United States, because of George Bush."
George Bush was great for us.
Right now we have so many creative people which we could hear here because we had George Bush.
"In November, 2007,"
"I was in Australia, in Sydney."
"So was George Bush, and he said, ""I'm so glad to be in Austria""."
(Laughter)
"Because, after seven years in power, he didn't know the difference between Austria and Australia."
"Then, he was opening a conference."
"He thought, ""Vienna, Austria"", opening this OPEC Conference."
"But it was not the OPEC Conference, it was the APEC Conference,"
The Asian-Pacific Conference.
"When this is your president,"
- we have some potential as well - we don't wait for the government anymore.
That's why we have seen huge innovations in the United States.
"Now, with Mr. Obama, everybody sits back and relaxes, and waits for what the president is doing."
"But before that, we had George Bush, and so we knew it is up to us."
We didn't wait for the government anymore.
"So, in a certain way, George Bush was beneficial."
"But only in certain ways, definitely."
We need to reinvent our products.
Everything we see in front of us is not designed.
"We talk about colors in Brazil, but all the colors that you see are hazardous waste. even the flip-flops that we saw are hazardous waste."
35 million flip-flops go into the ocean every year; 35 million.
"There's more seals, more whales, more turtles, more dolphins, killed by flip-flops, than by anything else,"
Because the animals eat the plastic.
There are 12 million tons of plastic going into the oceans.
Nothing is designed to go into biological systems; nothing is designed to go into the biosphere.
We feel so bad that we are here that we are romanticizing nature.
"People talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"But there is no ""Mother Earth""."

"Karim, we have no other choice"
- He used to memorize 2-4 pages a day..
"- but in the last portion of the Quran, he started memorizing.."
- .. 8pages a day!
-Masha'Allah
- and obviously he doesn't leave this institute?  - yes ofcourse.
"MashAllah Tabarak AlRahaman, Who encouraged him to memorize the Quran?"
"- No one encouraged him, he had personal desire to memorize the Quran."
"-MashAllah, as we know the one who memorizes the Quran must always be reviewing what he has memorized."
- How many pages does he review a day?
- He reviews 4 Chapters a day!
-MashAllah!
I ask Allah to bless him.
Chechnya
I have a small request..
Now that you have planned to memorize the Quran and started working on it...
Make sure you Do not Despair!
I know with this great Quran journey.. you will be facing many hardship and obstacles..
These obstacles should never let you stop what you are doing
"It should not let you say ""that's it.."
"Im going to stop memorizing the Quran"""
I have honestly met many people who have memorized upto 3 chapters and as soon as they faced a small obstacle.. they decided to stop memorizing the Quran!
Trust me when I say:
This is indeed from the Shaytaan.
"the honey, we know its sweet but we also know it was produced by the sharp needle on the bee! and just like the Quran, it is so great!"
Believe me..
"I have met many disabled people, they face so much hardship while memorizing the Quran but.."
They knew the great blessings behind memorizing the Quran.. so they did complete Memorizing the Quran with all these hardships and obstacles that you don't even face or will face [Since you are in good health] and if you have sincerely focused on this..Allah will ease every step you take because you want to memorize the book of Allah
Allah says:
"""And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways."""
Allah will make it easy way for you but make sure you do not despair!
The Old Grozny Institute - Chechnya
We had an ultimate visit to one the special institute here in Russia
On my left hand I had an old tape recorder.
"In it, Jimmy hendrix played his e-guitar against the Vietnam war."
Then she wanted me to imrpovise with my voice.
She wanted me to see pictures from wars with my inner eye.
She wanted me to apologise for mankind.
It goes like this.
In my hand I was holding a gong and I hit it during singing.
In the end a long broad red cloth came down.
"When Ahmed brought the myrrh to Germany, the next steps are the following."
These lumps are of no use in this way.
In a plant in Hamburg these are destilled to take out the essence from it.
"We can easily imitate that, because we don't need it super-clean."
"I put some of the myrrh into this fountain, turn it on, and the essence is generated."
This product is made in Taiwan.
"And it reminds me of my homeland, because the rocks in our landscapes look similar."
"And the sound from the water is really convenient, because in the hot summer, you only want to flee to the mountains to cool down."
The most beautiful in Taiwan is the east coast at the Pacific.
"When you have time, go there, make a biking tour."
"It is very nice, noone around, you hear the waves."
Myrrh gets credited with the power to balance body and soul.
I wanted to try and answer some questions with this project.
The first was: what are the difficulties with the product myrrh?
"I did my last performance together with a japaneese DJ, Hito, and a composer from Hongkong, Kimho."
It was about things that only we understand.
My second question was:
"When a person grows up away from his homeland, and later goes back there, how is this?"
"Hito dee-yays with her orange kimono, Berlin-style minimal."
Forth question:
"When I work with Somalis as a German, what should I know?"
"I danced a taiwaneese dance hit, that everybody dances there."
"Primary school children, housewives, workers at the chinese new year party,"
Even the gods with their big masks dance it at festivals on the streets.
-Should've known I'm a wild pitcher.
"-(announcer) Whatever you do, don't look back."
-Who is locking all these doors?
-Ah!

-(announcer) Kool Killer.
-Oh yeah!

Baby basket
Today we're going to make a gift basket for a baby.
"We're going to make it look original, elegant and with an artisan touch."
I've used a basket which you can find in any shopping centre or home interiors store.
"I've chosen the wicker one but it could also be white, or whatever colour you want, or which matches best."
To decorate it I've used a few bows made from quilted fabric.
"I have made the rest of the material for the basket with this quilted fabric, but if you go to the shops and you've chosen a blanket or some fabric which you like, try and get it all to match, so if you buy a few satin bows then you can decorate it using the same colours."
"In my case, because I have got it made to measure, they've made me these bows which look great."
"For the base, since I want the things to show at the top and not end up with everything sitting in the bottom and not looking pretty, we can put a base of tissue paper, which is the paper which we use for patterns or for children's handicraft, and I'm going to scrunch it up to make a base."
This tissue paper is very lightweight so we have to scrunch it up.
Now I've got the base on which to arrange all the items.
"I've bought a blanket, a towel, a bib a coat hanger which we have personalised, and a teddy bear which matches the other items."
Since it's a personal gift and I wanted something more artisanal
"I've made a personalised picture on a piece of cloth, in a thick frame, which looks very good, and I've decorated the edge with the same pattern as the rest of the drawing."
"I'm going to put the picture here, and then I'll put in the blanket, the hanger, the towel, and the bear on this side."
"To finish the wrapping you can buy some celophane like this, wrap it all up towards the top, and put on a big bow to finish it."
So that's the baby's gift basket.
I hope that you like it and that you have fun making it.
Until next time!
"vừa thời điểm bắt đầu chỉ có bóng tối và sau đó, bang tạo ra sự mở rộng không giới hạn của mọi hiện tượng như thời gian, không gian hãy nhìn xa hơn những gì chúng ta có thể tưởng tượng vượt qua cả sự tồn tại của chúng ta ở nơi mà chúng ta gọi là vũ trụ có thể có 1 thế giới khác ngoài kia"
Scientists were studying sharks off the coast of Florida using an acoustic tracking system.
"In the shallow bay, a locator signal every 15 minutes tracked their movements."
"Then one day, the sharks just disappeared."
And no one knew why.
"At the time, people had bigger problems."
A category four storm was bearing down on the Gulf Coast.
[thunder]
"Analyzing the data, scientists discovered sharks detected the drop in barometric pressure preceding the storm."
They bolted from their shallow nursery to the safety of deeper waters.
"Twelve hours later,"
Hurricane Charlie ripped across Florida.
"When the storm was over, the sharks returned."
"Reef sharks kick off the Survivor countdown because, thanks to incredible senses, they dodge disaster."
"Other animals are not so lucky-- battling adversity for days, months, or years."
One fifth of the Earth's surface is desert.
Baking hot.
Bone dry.
To survive here takes a special kind of animal... and special humans to catch them.
"In the Outback of Australia, these guys are hunting the next survivor sprinting into number 9-- the camel."
"Introduced in the 19th century, camels thrived in the arid land."
Now they're pests.
Rounded up and sent back to the Middle East.
Try running through a desert without water or shade... and you'd be dead in a day.
Camels barely break a sweat.
Camels can go eight days without water.
One secret for survival is on their back.
Camels store fat--not water-- in their hump.
It's a portable pantry.
"By burning all the fat in its hump, a camel can survive without food for up to a month."
"When a camel finds water, it soaks it up like a sponge."
A thirsty animal chugs 30 gallons in 13 minutes.
"Try that at home, and your blood cells would burst."
There was one huge possibility created by the emergence of money as a system of mutual trust.
A possibility that would revolutionize world history.
It was the idea that you could rely on people to borrow money from you and pay it back at some future date.
"That's why the root of credit is ""credo"""
"...then, a man who says he has absolutely no sexual desire at all is taking you inside the world of asexuals."
And the ladies are digging into some soulful dishes and finding out the secrets of southern revival cooking.
All that and the hot topics you want to hear coming up on The View.
"[music playing, audience applauds ]"
"Hello, everyone and welcome to The View."
"Well, it may seem like sex is everywhere these days, but it's not on the mind of David Jay."
He says he has absolutely no sexual desire whatsoever.
He's here to tell us about living as an asexal and why there are a lot more people like him than you think.
"Please welcome the founder of asexuality.org,"
David Jay.
David:
Thank you.
Elisabeth:
"We're gonna be,"
"I just want to let parents know at home, we're gonna be talking about some mature material here."
"So, if there are kids in the room, you may want to have them go somewhere else for a little bit."
"Um, we're going to give you a second to do that."
Star:
"She's the mother, she made sure of that."
[laughter]
Elisabeth:
Exactly.
Elisabeth:
"Um, you actually define yourself as an asexual."
You have an organization.
You're pretty much the spokesperson for asexuality.
"You have this organization with, what?"
"6,000 members?"
"Sir, if you saw someone eating insects... ...on a street corner, would you say that that person is mentally ill?"
"- Probably, yes."
- So can you say with confidence... ...that the behavior you saw in your daughter's bedroom... ...could not be the behavior of someone suffering from psychosis?
I don't know.
She never had any problems like that before.
It just didn't feel that way to me or to Father Moore.
"- And you trusted him, right?"
- Yes.
He is our parish priest.
Fair enough.
"And after that night, would you say that you... ...put your daughter entirely in Father Moore's care?"
Yes.
We had done all we could.
We said she was in his hands now... ...body and soul.
Thank you.
"No further questions, Your Honor."
"Thank you, Mr. Rose."
You may step down.
The defense calls Dr. Sadira Adani.
I am currently a professor of anthropology and psychiatry... ...at Northwestern University.
Where did you receive your education?
"At Yale, and then at Cambridge."
And what is your specific area of expertise?
I study the spiritual experiences of people in various cultures... ...and the physiological and psychological changes... ...they undergo during these experiences.
Would it be accurate to say that you specialize in the study of possession?
Yes.
"""Possession"" is one term for a basic human experience... ...reported by a great number of people all around the world."
"In my fieldwork, I've seen many people who experienced... ...a sense of being invaded by an entity from the supernatural realm."
Why do you think Emily was invaded?
Why did this possession happen to her?
Based on my study of the case file... ...I believe that Emily Rose was a hypersensitive.
"A person with an unusual connection... ...to what Carlos Castaneda called ""the separate reality."""
"Katrina is not my girlfriend, alright?"
And I doubt she gave you the stinkeye!
That's just the way her face looks.
"You know, that's just her face!"
I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.
"Hey, you big puffy version of junebug!"
Where have you been?
What's up?
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level.
You need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever!
The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are!
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.
No...I mean I'm already pregnant.
So what other kind of shenanigans can I get into?
"The answer is reject, and you can see it easily from the data shown here."
79.74 is the mean.
This is the 95% confidence interval--less than a kilogram.
"The reason why it's so small is because we have so many data samples, really interesting."
"As a result, we don't even come close to 73."
"So, if all the guesses that you guys voiced online were actual measurements using the actual scale of Sebastian, and this is what I told you and the question really was H0."
Is Sebastian telling the truth or is he lying?
"The, using statistical techniques, you should conclude he's lying."
This is somewhat contrived.
"This is the only data point, and everything else is just guesses."
But I hope you had fun using actual data that you students derived in answering this question.
The pupil asked:
"""To dissolve in Being or to dissolve in Non-Being - isn't this the same?"""
And the teacher said:
"""I DON'T KNOW!"""
To the pupil's birthday party some guests have come the guests were his classmates: two girls and three boys
"The food was: three pieces of bisсuit cake and 7 bottles of ""BAlKAL"" mineral water"
"One girl eat two pieces of the biscuit cake and drank 1.5 bottle of w.ww.... ater ""BAlKAL"" and... biloowwwssss...... and drank 1.5 bottles of BAlKAL water and on of the three boys drank, on bet, all the rest of the water and told that HE COULD HAVE DRUNK EVEN MORE!"
And I would encourage you to read critically not just like a consumer.
Finally.
I hope this class motivates you to learn.
Learning is a very powerful thing in life.
"And I, I, I'll talk about it a little bit later more in depth."
"But when you learn more, learn Finance."
"And the reason is, if you know Finance, you pretty much know most of anything you want to know in life."
And I'm kind of serious about it.
"[laugh], You know that's, that's the funny part."
"So objectives, why you want to do, think about it."
And I hope you're convinced that this is something that you really need to learn.
What are the prerequisites?
"I've been receiving emails about, prerequisites."
"This is a question that we always get, here in life classes, and this is very tough for me."
"Because fundamentally, it could be everything in life, or nothing."
"Some prerequisites could be nothing, or everything."
Why am I saying that?
"It's because if you're go into the detail of development of Finance, the first thing that's the basis of Finance is Economics."
And Economics is actually called the mother discipline of Finance.
It has borrowed mostly from that discipline.
"So,"
I would encourage you to know that.
"Behavioral Science is also becoming important over time, but economics remains the basic paradigm."
Accounting.
"I must admit, Accounting, though I know some of it, is kind of boring."
"And, but it's a"
language.
"I mean, it's like, if you didn't understand me because I'm speaking"
"English, there would be a problem."
"Similarly, if you don't understand accounting, you cannot understand what's going on."
"And because it's imperfect, like every other language, you really have to know it."
"I promise you, I will give you hints of what to do when we do accounting, because we can't do all of it."
I'll test you on the final to see whether you really understood that.
So now the sound is 4 times larger than when I cover one up.
I'll cover the other one up.
It's down by a factor of 4.
[tone]
I can cover this one up and then you hear nothing of course.
[tone]
"Now I will move this one [tone] to the location [tone] where there is destructive interference, [tone] which should be about half of 15.6 centimeters."
[tone]
Maybe you have good ears but I hear nothing anymore.
"Now I go through it and find the maximum, which is about 15.6 centimeters."
[tone]
Here it is.
[tone]
"And the other side, [tone] here's the maximum at center, so here should be a minimum, there it is, and I go to the other side, there should be a maximum."
[tone]
And there it is.
[tone]
"So what I have shown you today is I've shown you the interference pattern of sound, of water, of red laser light, of radar, and at the very least I hope I've convinced you as"
Young convinced the world in 1801 that light are waves.
And that means that Huygens was right and Newton was wrong.
Now that should perhaps not surprise you because Huygens was Dutch.
"But now, just to show you how complicated these learning problems can be, here's a story that is the flip side of Lauren's."
"Across the country in New York City there is a young girl whose social success has been masking a painful learning problem, a problem that because it exists in the inner city, might have been written off as something other than the neurological disconnect that it really is."
11-year-old Sara Lee Harris has always had lots of friends.
"Some of my friends are Amber, Roshida, Shana, Akima, Kimmy."
Sarah Lee is the youngest of four children.
"Her mom has one simple goal for her children, a good solid education."
My oldest daughter when she graduated from high school she went to Queensborough
College.
My son graduated from high school.
The twins graduate this year.
And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.
"OK, I'm still in ""Poetics,"" in Aristotle, and I'm thinking -- out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head that I haven't heard since my classics professor in college drilled them there."
And they are anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.
"Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis."
"It's what our network does; it's what ""Dirty Jobs"" is."
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.
Great.
"The other word, peripeteia, that's the moment in the great tragedies, you know --"
"Euripides and Sophocles -- the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with is his mother."
OK.
That's peripety or peripeteia.
And this metaphor in my head --
I got anagnorisis and peripetia on my chin.
(Laughter)
"I got to tell you, it's such a great device though."
"When you start to look for peripetia, you find it everywhere."
"I mean, Bruce Willis in ""The Sixth Sense,"" right?"
"Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people, and then, boom -- ""Oh, I'm dead"" -- peripetia."
You know?
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.
"Neo in ""The Matrix,"" you know?"
"""Oh, I'm living in a computer program"" -- that's weird."
"These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations; and I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs, I have them all the time, but that one -- that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for."
"And, as I stood there,"
looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled -- but it looked OK.
"Looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on, and I just was struck by if I'm wrong about that and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way, what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?"
"Because, look, I'm not a social anthropologist but I have a friend who is."
And I talk to him.
(Laughter)
"And he says, ""Hey Mike."
"So we shipped our 0.7, and I think it was when we got to 0.8 with Firefox which it would have been on May or June of 2004, that we finally understood we had a chance."
Like a real chance.
Because 0.8 of Firefox was far enough along that people started noticing it.
And the number of people using Firefox started to grow.
Pretty soon there were more people using Firefox 8 than had ever used the Mozilla suite.
"Something like a million, or two or three million."
And the other way that I knew that we were on the right track was Tim O'Reilly called us up.
I mean I know Tim forever because I've been in the open source world for a number of years but this time he called up to say
"""Hey, we're hearing a lot about Firefox."
"Can we come down and talk to you?"""
"Tim O'Reilly's greater skill is he has a phenomenal nose for what's new, what's coming and what technology is gonna be interesting."
So there were a lot of clues.
"Then, the summer of 2004 was a long summer."
"Because in between 0.9 and 1.0 was five or six months, that's when the extension system was built and I think I've been the most nervous I've ever been in that phase."
I remember speaking and I could not...
"I was on a panel but I walked across the stage constantly,"
"I was sick to my stomach because we knew this was our big bet, we could see the stuff was happening but there was that pressure that you have to ship the product."
"So the final phases of Firefox, getting the first version out, were the start page and we..."
Before Firefox the start page had been a typical open source project:
"""Hi!"
Wanna help?
Here is Bugzilla.
Don't like Bugzilla?
Here's Despot.
You don't like that?
"Here's the link for Tinderbox."""
So when we made the commitment to ship a consumer product we realised that doesn't help most people.
[Question]
"Unlike Bugzilla, which is smooth and lovely..."
"That shows you our standards, right?"
"So this was again an immense emotional intense, like knocked-down drag-out fight."
What to do?
"Yes, the wounds lasted for some time."
And did you attach any supernatural significance to these wounds?
I believe they were stigmata.
"By that, you mean supernatural injuries... ...that correspond to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ?"
Yes.
"Stigmata are a sign, a mark indicating one is touched by God."
"After that night, why do you think Emily refused another exorcism?"
I believe she'd accepted her fate.
Is there anything else you'd like to say about Emily?
No.
The defense rests.
Father Moore attaches divine significance... ...to the wounds on Emily's hands and feet.
Why?
Because he sees them as confirmation of what he wants to believe.
"That Emily was a saint, touched by the hand of God."
I'm afraid the truth is far less inspiring.
"Because the truth is, by the time these miraculous wounds appeared... ...Emily had already shown a tendency to injure herself... ...and simply did so again on one of the barbed-wire fences... ...surrounding the Rose family farm."
Father Moore's beliefs are based on archaic and irrational superstition.
Emily suffered because she was sick... ...not because she was a saint.
I'm a man of faith.
And I am also a man of facts.
"And in here, facts are what must matter."
And these are the facts of this case:
"Emily Rose had epilepsy, which caused psychosis."
"And, given time, medicine would have cured her."
But it didn't.
Why?
"Because Father Richard Moore convinced Emily... ...that she wasn't ill, that she didn't need medicine."
And in the weeks leading up to her death... ...when she was clearly in need of medical treatment... ...he failed to have her hospitalized.
So... ...the defense has given us an extraordinary... ...creative explanation for the events that led to this.
"Ladies and gentlemen, don't you believe it."
"Because the fact is, it wasn't the devil that did this to Emily Rose."
Any might that you might think that my city as the ideal city.
It is not.
You would be a straight jacket for future generations.
They will make all the cities.
Do you understand?
No final frontiers.
That is the message.
"Well, i got all these ideas from the human body."
"When you get an infection on your toes, there is no community."
That sends a command to the brain.
"And the brain says, oh, i am going to do a two month study."
But at that time your infection is up to your knee.
The antibody go right away.
So every organ of the body is taking care of it.
That is how the Earth is operated.
"Nature's way, not Fresco's way."
Will check.
"""There is one outstandingly important fact regarding spaceship earth."
"And that is that no instruction book came with it."" (R. Buckminster Fuller)"
"- Hi Fiorela, tell me what do you do and why do you blog?"
"- Well, I have two kinds of blogs."
"One has personal content, ""Bitácoras de Fiori Álvarez"" where I tell all kinds of stories, short stories that cross my mind at that moment, some of them are my own experiences, another are my friend's experiences, and things that necessarily need to be repeated, in some way."
"The other blog, has more academic content"
They are brief summaries of what I read.
I study Political Science.
"So, you will find a lot about Sociology, Political Sciences."
"International Relations, etc."
"Basically what I want in the first one is to have a place to vent in the second one, I seek to share knowledge because not to many people have access to a certain kind of books or they don't easily understand them."
"-Besides your blogs, in what other places are you in internet?"
"- Well, I follow some blogs, starting for Ivan Lazo's blogs"
I follow Lucifer Achocada ... ... well different kind of contents there are different things that I read..
"Most of them are about politics, because of my career. the second is related to short stories and simple writings, just to distract my mind for a while."
Hi there.
Look on this.
Thank you.
Saying that power plants are the number one cause of global warming is like saying that humans are the number one cause of global warming.
"Power plants don't emit energy, don't create energy for the purposes of just creating energy for the sake of it."
"They create it for industries, and one of the industries that uses the most energy is factory farming."
"In the US, the meat industry uses about one third of all the fossil fuels that we generate."
"Headquarters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, in short PETA."
They have almost 2 million members and are active worldwide.
I love this one as well.
- Oh yes. - This is a very famous one.
We've got this.
I suspect that for Al Gore and for a lot of other people it's just too inconvenient of a truth.
"Gore was a politician and is beholden to a lot of industry people, in many different industries."
Probably in the meat industry too.
"And while he certainly has done admirable work, its disheartening to say the least that he has continued to ignore the fact that the meat he's eating every night for dinner is the number one cause of global warming."
I'm Alicia Silverstone and I'm a vegetarian.
There is nothing in the world that has changed me as much as this.
I feel so much better and have so much more energy.
It's so amazing.
There is a prominent environmental group in the US called Environmental Defence.
"And they recently wrote on their website that if every American replaced chicken with vegetarian foods for just one meal per week, it would be the equivalent in carbon dioxide of taking about 500,000 cars off the US roads."
"Here in the United States, big is beautiful."
That applies to the cars and definitely to the steaks.
The average American eats 124 kilos of meat a year.
44 more kilos than the average Dutchman.
"At night, at the hotel, I watch a classic about American factory farming."

"Here you go, Leo."
"Psst, Leo!"
Who are you?
How did you know my name?
"Now, we can have it into full screen and it will show me what's happening at a 720 pixel."
Look how great that
looks on your TV screen.
This is YouTube.
It's pretty amazing.
All right.
We're going
to go pause this again.
"Now, YouTube has actually launched a new product called YouTube Leanback that's actually defaulted for the Google or for the big screen experience."
"Not specifically for Google TV, but for any large screen that you're viewing YouTube on."
"Now, YouTube Leanback automatically defaults video into full screen."
"It also has very intuitive controls so that you can search, pause, play, rewind all the videos one by one."
"So you see here I can just navigate right, play any video I want to, I can even browse down and search by category."
"And again, it controls, are large and very intuitive."
"So, with Google TV, all of these can become a reality in your television."
But this is not just about video and it's not just about YouTube.
"From here, I can go anywhere on the web."
What about FarmVille?
"Now, did you know that the last I checked, 10% of Americans are playing FarmVille every single day?"
"I don't know what the statistic is for Germans, but that boggles my mind."
Okay.
"So, online games are pretty fun."
What about music?
"Now, there's so many online music streaming sites these days, what if you could play music from your TV?"
"Your TV if often connected to the best speakers in your house, so why shouldn't your music be coming out of those speakers?"
What about photos?
A lot of people these days are uploading their photos to places like
"Picasa, Flickr, Facebook, and a lot of these sites actually have a very interesting feature called slideshow mode."
"Now, again, what's more compelling, a 10-inch digital photo viewer sitting on your coffee table or a 50-inch TV sitting in your living room?"
It's the best and brightest screen in your house.
"This is the screen that you should be displaying all of your photos on, and now you can."
Okay.
Always getting the short end of the stick.
Herding is a really good and interesting alternative to foraging and agriculture.
"You domesticate some animals, and then you take them on the road with you."
The advantages of herding are obvious.
First: you get to be a cowboy.
"Also, animals provide meat and milk, but they also help out with shelter, because they can provide with wool and leather."
"The downside is that you have to move around a lot, because your herd always needs new grass, which makes it harder to build cities."
Unless you are the Mongols.
"By the way, for the next 14 weeks, you will frequently hear generalization followed by"
"""Unless you are the Mongols"""
"But anyway, one of the main reasons herding only caught on certain parts of the world is that there aren't that many animals that lend themselves to domestication."
"Like, you have sheep, goats, caddle, pigs, horses, camels, donkeys, reindeer, water buffalo, yaks, all of which have something in common: they aren't native to the Americas."
The only half-way useful herding animal native to the Americas is the llama.
"No, not that llama."
Two Ls.
"Yes, that llama."
Most animals just don't work for domestication.
"Like, hippos are large, which means they provide lots of meat."
But unfortunately they like to eat people.
Zebras are too ornery; grizzlies have wild hearts that can't be broken.
"Elephants are awesome, but they take way too long to breed."
"Which reminds me, it's time for the open letter."
Elegant.
But first let's see what the secret compartment has for me today.
"Oh, it's another double cheeseburger."
Thanks secret compartment.
"Just kidding, I don't thank you for this."
An open letter to elephants.
"Hey, elephants."
"You are so cute, and smart, and awesome."
Why you gotta be pregnant for 22 months?
That's crazy.
Win Phippen:
"On a more sophisticated scale, the corn and soybean production has been around for a while."
And there are several plant breeders in the country that have actually been working on this.
But they are simply trying to improve production practices.
"And so they could be, simply, improving the hybrids for insect resistance, or disease resistance."
Every year new diseases come along.
Soybean Asian Rust is one that came back a few years ago.
All of our current varities didn't have Soybean Asian Rust resistance in it.
"And so now they are looking back to the old wild populations to see if they can find that resistance and find some old lines, and cross it into today's hybrid line."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
And why it is that Western is well positioned to be doing this sort or research?
Win Phippen:
We're in the perfect location.
"We're ideally suited, in the middle of the Midwest."
"We're right in the center of a lot of graduate-level programs, where students can go on and get master's degrees, and PhDs in plant breeding."
"And, most of the seed-breeding companies are located right here in the Midwest."
And so our students come in with a good agricultural background.
And now they can get...
"This grant adds a new minor here in the department, in the School of Ag."
Beth Seaton:
So you have a new minor in plant breeding?
Win Phippen:
A new minor in plant breeding.
So that offers two new courses.
One is in traditional plant breeding...
And this is where we simply cross plants with each other.
And it offers the new bio-technology plant breeding.
"And this is, you've probably heard about genetically engineering plants."
This is here we can introduce DNA from other sources into plants to give it some unique traits.
And this is where we can have plants resistant to herbicides and insects and things like that.
Beth Seaton:
Hockenheim.
It was while test driving and I was always a proponent of hassling people.
That's what we were talking about.
This hierarchy...
"Mansell, Prost, Senna, Berger wanted to put us in our places, which I could never accept."
One example was the test driving in Hockenheim.
I was during a qualifying simulation.
"Ayrton already finished his turn, actually, but suddenly he wanted to come in again."
"He saw that I was straight behind him and even though he had Honda power he drove the curves very slowly, but I could not overtake in a curve, so I tried on the straight but he pushed the throttle and was gone again."
I could not keep up with my Ford engine.
"He did that to me twice in different moments, but then there was a third situation."
"But this time, I was the one ahead and of course I made now the same play as he did."
But he could not stand that and told me afterwards that this is not a correct behaviour.
So that were the first conflicts with the established ones.
I remember that Berger once said:
"""This guy is so eager."
Totally overambitious.
"Actually we don't like him!"""
Did you feel that you got kind of ignored by those drivers?
I felt the opposing wind from them.
"There was an interesting situation, I think in the first or second year"
"Gerhard (Berger) had a flat tire, drove on the side, could not go fast anymore."
I tried to overtake and he totally cut in on me.
This was an act to show me that I should be aware when and whom I overtake
Years later we went home from Monza in the same car...
I already made my first championship and we had an honest conversation.
He said:
"""Well friend, at that time we had the feeling that we must run rings around you."""
You were considered as unapproachable at that time...
What do you think about it?
Quite the contrary!
"Of course I was stubborn, ambitious and focused, but I always tried to be fair"
The team travels a lot and their on the road for quite sometime how do the students keep up with their school work?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's difficult and I think golf is probably as challenging as any of the sports.
Because you know when we play on the road the first day is typically a 36 hole round.
That's 10 hours of being on the golf course your completely wiped out.
And it's tough to keep up you but know they have the computers they...they stay with them and they work on projects together a lot of times their in class together.
So they can try and help each other out as far as assignments and tests and things like that so you know typically
I've had good students on the team and this year is no exception.
We have great kids that work hard and they do their best in the classroom.
[Nick Spinozzi]
This Friday the team goes on the road to compete in the Pinehurst Intercollegiate Tournament.
What do you expect to come out?
Do you expect to come out with a victory?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well that's a very difficult field.
I mean there's I think 3 Bit Ten Schools there.
UNC Wilmington's ranked 52 a lot of good mid-major schools are there.
And so you know I think that we have our work cut out for us in terms of winning the tournament.
"But, you know our schedules very demanding and I think that pays off for us in the...in the Summit League at the end."
So you know I expect us to...to continue to improve
I'm not going to put any predictions on how we finish.
"But, obviously Pinehurst is a great place to be the golf course is a great challenge for us."
The kids will really get a great experience out of being at Pinehurst.
[Nick Spinozzi]
How much of an advantage would you say the team has when it competes in the Beu Mussatto Invitational?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I think playing on home course is a big advantage.
Because the golf course is very challenging it's got some holes on it you really need to play a few times and get some experience on it.
The greens are very challenging difficult a lot of slope so it is a big advantage.
Althought we have some very difficult schools coming.
Oakland in our conference is doing very well this year.
Wisconsin Greenbay has a great team.
"We just got an announcement, for those on the phone, about a film Jurassic Park is being played, I guess somewhere in this building, I don't know."
"But , um, the nice thing is, if the developer has written the application properly, and it works well with voice over, any edit box you get to, you can turn Quick Navigation off and you have this whole facility of being able to move by line, character, word, cut, copy and paste."
If you hold down Option and hit left and right arrow you'll move by word.
"You can do Command X to cut text, Command C to copy, Command V to paste--just like Control X, C, and V will do it in Windows."
It's really wonderful.
"So, yeah, any edit box is going to work."
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav again?
[coordinator]
"Um, sorry, question from the phone, would you repeat the question?"
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn on QuickNav?
[panelist]
I didn't hear the question.
[coordinator]
We can't hear the question.
It's something to do with quick nav.
[teleconference caller]
How do you turn it off and on?
[coordinator]
How do you turn QuickNav off and on?
[panelist]
Great question.
"On the keyboard, you hold the left and right... ok, you hit the left and right arrow keys together. ..."
"It just said ""quick nav on."""
"And I'm going to hit them together again, [software speaks]"
"""Quick nav off."""
It's a toggle.
"And the great thing about that is you can turn Quick Nav on, quickly move to the edit box, then turn Quick Nav off and, just, start, you know, typing away."
"Or If the edit box isn't selected, and you want to edit, you can actually, if you move to with Quick Nav ... if you press the up and down arrow keys at the same time to go into the edit box, it will automatically turn Quick Nav off for you."
Good point.
[Other panelist]
But what about a kid who wasn't identified early or who wasn't targeted for medication therapy or one on one attention?
"This is the story of a teenager who slipped through the cracks, an object lesson in missed signals."
"On the edges of Boston in this neighborhood known as Hyde Park, many families are scratching to make a living."
"One family, the Dunnings, is raising four kids here."
Adam is their second son.
"He was just a good little kid, very well liked."
"Always, neighbors and teachers, and CCD teachers, and coaches would always tell me, what a well mannered son you have."
His mother realized early on that Adam had a problem.
Adam and I would read together every night.
And he couldn't identify words that he should have been familiar with.
"When he started second grade, I knew that there was a building block that was kind of beginning to crumble."
"The school teachers kept saying he's just lazy, you know."
And his personality carried him through.
"Adams a good kid he's just, you know, we'll worry about him"
later.
"Finally, by the fifth grade, Adam's problems in school were obvious to his teachers."
He was given a battery of tests.
But school officials assured the
Dunnings their son was average and would do just fine.
"I think the problem with the initial testing was that when you do an IQ test, you've got 12 sub tests."
And half of them are language based and half of them or not.
So you end up getting scores that get added together.
And Adam's scores added together come up as average.
"But Adam, struggling with even the most basic reading, writing, and spelling tasks had the feeling he wasn't even average."
"I felt embarrassed at some times, like when I couldn't pronounce words and then other kids would pronounce the word for me."
"Say hurry up, you don't know how to read."
I got comments like that all the time.
By now his parents began to really worry about Adam.
They asked the school for more tests.
And by the end of seventh grade the school had a bombshell for the
Dunnings.
They told us that Adam was reading on a third grade level.
"So in the comments please tell me that you go right now, find fashion designers on Linkedln, on Facebook, and you turn them into your happy clients."
Alright?
"If you think there is still any piece of the puzzle missing, then let me know that one in the comments as well, I will answer."
"Besides that, click on +1, click on ""like"" and then stop the video and go get your assignment."
Alright.
I wish you good light!
[Wes]
"So I'm very happy to be here at Mozilla with Brendan Eich, the CTO of Mozilla, and the designer of JavaScript."
So u could tell us how that language came to be.
[Brendan]
Sure.
So I can say more about how I got ready to make JavaScript.
It was when I wrote Netscape.
"I didn't have much time to do that, and I had to have the skills already."
And I've been just seated writing programming language implementations for my entire carreer.
When I got into Computer Science it was for Physics.
First studying theory of formal languages and automata theory.
"Regular languages, regular expressions."
This was the early 80ties and I loved the cleverness of the theory and rather direct way of implementing theories as algorithms.
"So you can make a parser or a lexer , semi-automatically or automatically."
"It was strange to me, and it was useful too."
I think every practicer in programs should take some time to invent a language at some point.
"There's often a need you have that no typical language is perfect for, or you have some leasure time and you can use that."
It's educational and can often solve your problem in a better way than any other language.
"And so, I encourage that."
"I did that myself and there is something that helped me to get ready to write JavaScript because when I got into Netscape and the heat of the moment was there, with Java looming."
Questions about if we needed two languages: a scripting language versus a big language as Java.
I had to go fast.
I had to have all sort... in my muscles I had to have some practice already on the way.
[Wes]
So in this class we will learn a lot of the things he have just mentioned. in various points.
"Regular Expressions,"
That appeal attracts people all over the world.
Economic growth in Asia is due to millions of families wanting to give their children a better life.
"The TV series ""Home to the Village"" shows the cruelty of urbanization."
It's not fun to move from a rural community to a tenement house.
In China rice growers get silicosis working in stone processing plants.
"Becoming an industrial worker is not a beautiful thing, you'll agree."
We build dams that flood valleys.
But what is the alternative?
"It's living in the countryside and having six kids, of whom two die."
"The population doubles in a generation, there's war and misery."
But the path of development that's available is not pretty.
And of course we have the impending climate threat.
The US ambassador made a statement in a Swedish national paper that:
"""The climate issue cannot be solved without regulating India and China."""
Scandalous!
He's crazy.
"China emits 3 tons of CO2 per capita, the US 21 tons."
He shouldn't talk until the US cuts emissions to 10 tons per capita.
The United States needs to halve its energy consumption.
Where does your great dedication come from?
It's really fun to work with what I do.
My interest in the world developed into curiosity as to why this shouldn't work.
Why is Malaysia free from malaria?
"Why does Singapore, a tropical marsh on the equator have the world's best health?"
They did welfare investments.
"They had children's health centers, got rid of drugs..."
They created good social development.
People tend to say I paint the world in excessively rosy colors.
But I don't.
Ten million children die each year in the world.
But you have to see the improvements even if huge problems remain.
You have to see the risk of climate change and still say that not many people are dying of it yet.
The algae are more efficient. &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well you're getting at it.
"They are more efficient, but they're more efficient in a particular sense that makes a big difference to rates."
Okay?
This is the difference--this is a still photo and this is a movie.
Okay?
So there's--that's the difference.
It's a difference in rate.
Yes?
Student:
Algae reproduce a lot faster.
Prof:
"That's basically it, yes."
"A single celled alga can probably have two generations per day and-- at least one per day--and maybe even in a warm estuary three per day, whereas a grass is probably going to be lucky to get through two or three generations per season."
Okay?
So there's a difference of perhaps a hundredfold in the rate.
"And the things that are eating them have a much, much longer lifespan."
"So down here what's going on is that the algae, there are not so many of them, but they're cranking over like crazy, and they're getting harvested"
like crazy by all of the planktivores in the ocean.
"So the krill, the copepods, everything that eats algae, is grazing them, and that's keeping the algae at a fairly low level."
They're a long away from their own carrying capacity.
They're in exponential growth rate almost all the time.
"So they're booming along, and it doesn't take so much standing crop to maintain a lot more biomass because they are turning over and reproducing and multiplying so quickly."
So that is why you see this dramatic shift.
"Okay, so that's a bit of the overall description of the world's ecosystems."
Now let's take a look at cycles of matter.
Okay?
"The main compartments are oceans, fresh water,"
"land and atmosphere, and they are exchanging materials all the time."
You're already familiar with the upwelling patterns;
I've mentioned that when I was discussing the Coriolis force.
Elisabeth:
"Then he's in a bit of a pickle, isn't he?"
Joy:
Let's leave his pickly out of this.
[laughter]
David:
"I've been fortunate enough that the people I've been in relationships with have been respectful and also we talk about it, we communicate if you openly communicate about what's going on then it gives a space to work it out."
That's what's important.
Elisabeth:
Thank you for being as candid as you have been today.
I know a lot of people feel the same way you feel.
"All right, thanks to David Jay."
"If you want to learn more about asexuality,"
David will be seen in an upcoming segment on 20/20.
We'll be right back.
"Well, when we took that break, Brian, you mentioned that you had some special guests once, that you met the..."
We were with the 130 at the time
"We were supporting the Antarctic ... and the astronauts, the navy was the recover for them, like the mercury astronauts, primarily."
"But the Air Force, we train crews and we were all over the world, and I ended up ... in which I'd been to a couple of times."
"We covered between South America and Africa and then we had them in Singapore, we had them in..."
I'd been to Greenland a couple times and I didn't want to go to Antarctica.
"I had a choice of either going with the astronaut recovery or that, so I volunteered, and we..."
"There was another guy, too, who did most of..."
"And then, at the last minute, we'd bring in the guys that would take the other airplanes."
So I was down to... in Florida for probably a month.
And we take the
Air Force paramedics out.
We take a dummy capsule a couple hundred miles out.
We'd go find it and dress these guys - put their scuba gear and stuff on them - and they'd jump out and then I'd sit in the tailgate of the back of the truck of the one-thirty.
With the flotation collar that went around it.
"Too small, little one man or two man rafts"
"There'd be tools, and a medical kit, and food and stuff."
But rats have incredible survival skills.
They can chew through cinder blocks... squeeze through spaces the size of a quarter... survive a fall of 50 feet... swim over a mile... and tread water for three days.
"One pair can potentially produce 15,000 descendants a year!"
Rats don't have many friends... possibly because they go where we go.
Rats are bad for the health.
"In the last 1,000 years, diseases carried by rats have killed more people than all of the world's wars and revolutions combined."
And there's every chance rats will survive
long after we've been wiped off the face of the planet.
Nuclear holocaust.
But rats can survive.
Eniwetok Atoll.
A string of tiny islands in the Pacific Ocean.
It was a tropical paradise for rats.
Until the U.S. military arrived.
"Between 1946 and 1958, 40 nuclear bombs were detonated on Eniwetok Atoll."
The largest explosion carved a mile-wide crater in the coral reef.
MAN:
It is now 30 seconds to zero time.
Put on goggles or turn away.
"Minus ten seconds, niner, eight, seven, six, fiver, four, three, two, one, T zero."
NARRATOR:
The destructive power of the test was roughly 800 times larger than the explosion in Hiroshima.
It seemed the island was wiped clean of life...
but not of rats.
"Shielded from the blast inside cable tunnels or under concrete, they emerged into the apocalypse."
"Two years later, scientists found the rat population had not only survived... but thrived."
They'd scavenged food on the beach and supplemented their diet with a little cannibalism.
"The rats appear healthy, normal animals."
But nobody's quite sure what mutations may have been caused by exposure to so much radiation.
All life needs water.
Southern Africa is ravaged by droughts.
Most fish die.
There's an old wood bridge.
"If the guild is truly active again, they'll get their orders there."
My lady.
Did you find out?
The Queen sent her away?
"Yes, and without the King knowing."
Yet something's not right.
"If she's feeling poorly, why have no medicines been sent to her pavilion?"
So she leaves on medical grounds but doesn't tell the King?
"Yungsun, get the whole story."
"Lady Jo, send word to the Viceroy that I want to see him today."
Your Grace.
"Well, Dong Yi, why did you REALLY leave?"

In this video I'd like to talk about the power of creating and comparing alternatives.
And to do that I'm going to share some research that Steven Dow did as a postdoctoral scholar with me at Stanford University.
"When you're designing, does it make more sense to go for quality and try to come up with the best possible design?"
Or does it make more sense to go for quantity first as a path to try and learn and understand?
"There's a story that Bayles and Orland tell about an art teacher who divides the class in half, and he tells one half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded exclusively on the quality of the very best thing that you make."""
"He tells the other half of the class,"
"""You're going to be graded on the quantity of things that you make."
"Doesn't matter how good it is; all that matters is how much that you make."""
"And what this teacher found was that while the quantity group was busily churning our piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the quality group sat around theorizing, and at the end of the day they had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and piles of dead clay."
So this gives us some intuition that rapidly producing many alternatives has a lot of value.
"And to explore this further, Steven and I had people create egg drop devices."
"Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi."
"Goodbye, Martin Luther King."
"Hello, gangs from this neighborhood killing gangs from that neighborhood."
Hello governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can't even afford to give them food.
Hello civilization.

Look what we've ...
look what they've done.

"Mainstream art, cinema, has been used across the world to talk about social issues."
"A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti, which suddenly spawned thousands of young people wanting to volunteer for social change."
"In Venezuela, one of the most popular soap operas has a heroine called Crystal."
"And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer, 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done."
"And of course, ""The Vagina Monologues"" we know about."
"And there are stand-up comics who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues."
"So, why is it, that if we think that we all agree that we need a better world, we need a more just world, why is it that we are not using the one language that has consistently showed us that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?"
"What I need to say to the planners of the world, the governments, the strategists is, ""You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake."
"It needs to be the yeast."""
"Because, any future planning, if 2048 is when we want to get there, unless the arts are put with the scientists, with the economists, with all those who prepare for the future, badly, we're not going to get there."
"And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen."
"So, what is it that we require?"
What is it that we need?
"We need to break down our vision of what planners are, of what the correct way of a path is."
"And to say all these years of trying to make a better world, and we have failed."
There are more people being raped.
There are more wars.
There are more people dying of simple things.
"So, something has got to give."
And that is what I want.
Can I have my last audio track please?

I asked people to join us on the board and it slowly started to grow.
I started to advertise and it s started to grow more.
I have had many parents and community members say they learned alot and that makes me happy and excited.
"I""m exicted to see how much it has grown,but it still needs more ""sun""(attention)and more water(love)."
I want your help.
We need money-it's honest.
We need money.
"But,I""m not going to ask you for alot."
I 'm just asking you to give $10.
"If everyone would donate $10,together we can raise alot of money."
"We can raise $5,000."
What will we do with that money?Go shopping?NO:) We will be able to give 8 children 8 weeks of free therapy.
We have hooked up with frendo a new company.
There is no processing fee.

Thank you.
Taking just a few seconds to cool freshly laid eggs could add weeks to thier shelf life according to a Purdue University study.
The rapid cooling process uses liquid carbon dioxide to stabilize the protein in eggs thus extending their shelf life.
You can cool eggs many different ways.
"Traditional cooling of eggs, which would be the eggs you would find in the grocery store those are typically just cooled under ambient conditions where the eggs are put into a carton, they're about 105°F. and then they cool over time."
It takes about 10-14 days for those eggs to cool to refrigeration temperature.
The egg cooling system that we've developed here based on using carbon dioxide as a liquid that we can spray and create a cold snow.
This snow is about -107°C.
(negative).
This snow can be circulated around the eggs and we're able to then rapidly cool eggs.
Instead of taking 10-14 days we can do it in the range of seconds of treatment time.
Eggs cooled under current methods lose the AA grade in about six weeks.
Keener's study shows that this rapid cooling process can significantly increase this time period.
"So typically your eggs at the grocery store, those are traditionally cooled where they are just allowed to cool under ambient conditions."
The shelf life on those eggs is usually 4-6 weeks.
We won't stand for tyranny!

In this session we値l be talking about Renaissance and the landscape that incorporated the time roughly from the 14th to the 17th century.
We値l be talking about Italy and the Italian philosophies and different design styles and how they set a pattern for the rest of northern Europe which became known as the Northern Renaissance.
The Renaissance was a cultural movement.
It began in Italy in the late Middle Ages and then spread to the rest of Europe.
The ideas from the Renaissance have disseminated from around the 15th century across Europe.
"It was really this resurgence in classicism and it was a time of development of linear perspective, artists and rendering techniques, realistic type paintings and gradual educational reform."
The tortoise and the hare are racing to see who can run 100 feet in the shortest amount of time.
"You're better off with a nine-to-five job."""
80% of the people fail within the first year.
"Go back home."" That's what they told me."
Announcer:
"Stephen disregarded those discouraging words and when he once again found himself in the vice-president's office, he acted on his intuition."
Stephen:
"I looked at him in the eye and I said, ""Sir, if you don't hire me,"""
"""you'll never know what I can do for this firm."""
Announcer:
"Stephen got the job, but with one final condition."
"Stephen: he said, ""We'll train you for three months, we'll give you a little salary."""
"""At the end of three months, you have to take a 250 question examination."
"If you fail by one point, YOU'RE OUT!"""
Announcer:
"Stephen passed that exam and over the next four years he achieved national recognition,"""
"""earning a six figure salary as his personal sales increased by over 1,700%."""
"But there was something more, a broader goal and purpose for his life which came to him with instant clarity on a vacation trip to the ocean."
Stephen:
"I had to get away for a while, remember I was a stock broker at the time, and I had to get away."
"It was a lot of pressure, I just needed a little bit of sun and a little bit of water, and a little bit of sand."
"I needed a little bit of a tan, too (laughter)."
"So I went away, and there I was on the beach, and it was a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous day."
I was reading a book and then it happened.
Out of the clear blue my eyes flew open.
It was a revelation.
I just knew that my life purpose was to become a speaker and an author.
Announcer:
"Since that decisive moment on that beach, Stephen has shared his inspiring story through the medium of television and radio as an author and has spoken to hundreds of organizations of all ages, all across America and has never looked back, except to remember the people who helped to encourage him along the way."
People like his fifth grade teacher.
Stephen: ...and then Mrs. Jordan made a grand entrance into my life.
She was a larger-than- life woman with salt and pepper hair and eyes that I swore twinkled.
"Have you ever had someone in your life that you wanted to be so much a part of, people who are that powerful?"
Net short term effect on the state's budget?
Zero or worse.
It is not about the budget.
It is really not.
"It is not about the budget in Wisconsin, it is not about the budget in Florida, it's not about the budget in Ohio, it is not about the budget in Michigan."
"But what Michiganders know, and what Michiganders have been trying to get the rest of the country to pay attention to, is that what these Republicans are doing in the states, is not just 'not about the budget'."
It's about something way worse than that.
Stay with me for a moment here.
There is more to this.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
This is our house.
Kill the bill.
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Kill the bill!
Why are these people in Michigan so loud?
Why are these people in Michigan so mad?
"Not just because they haven't won yet, like the protesters in Wisconsin have, it's because Michigan Republicans are telling them, that they are about to lose their right to elect local government."
The governor's just going to take care of that from now on.
"See, the governor knows best."
"This whole democracy thing, turns out, it's very inefficient."
And haven't you heard?
There's a crisis.
"Big government conservatism gets really, really, really astonishingly big."
That's next.
"The Michigan House has already passed, and the Michigan Senate is about to pass a bill that sounds like it is out of a dystopian leftist novel from the future."
"If you think that Republican governors around the country are using fiscal crisis as a pretext, to do stuff they wouldn't otherwise want to do, this is something I don't think I every would have believed Republicans even wanted to do."
But this is what they're proposing.
"This hasn't really gotten much national attention, but please just check this out."
"Governor Rick Snyder's budget in Michigan is expected to cut aid to cities and towns, so much, that a lot of cities and towns in Michigan are expected to be in dire financial straights."
"Exactly, so there's just nothing there."
"These guys are grass finishing, they go literally from here..."
In fact 12 of these are going to go to slaughter tomorrow.
"So they go directly from here, right to the abattoir."
What do you do in the winter?
Cause obviously the pasture isn't available in the winter.
At least in most of the continental US.
"Yeah, what happens is, with this grazing management, we're able to stockpile grass, just by not allowing them to graze late in the season, into the winter."
"The average farm in our area feeds hay 120 days a winter, we feed hay only 40 days a winter."
"We've greatly reduce the amount of hay we have to feed, which is less hay we have to make,"
less hay we have to feed.
How do you do that?
"By controlling the grazing with moving the animals everyday to a new paddock, and allowing rest periods to deny access to certain pastures late in the season so that it just stands on the stalk going into the winter."
It's OK to eat that fresh.
"Absolutely, even when it frosts, and it turns brown it's still better than hay."
So that's what we do going into the winter.
"You are able to cut it down to two thirds, the amount of hay that they require?"
"Yes, yes."
And this is something that most typical beef producers could do if they chose to.
Everyone of them.
Relatively easily.
From Florida to...
"What's interesting is, it doesn't have anything to do with latitude, because the average farmer in Florida feeds hay for 120 days a year."
"In illinois, 120 days a year."
"In Saskatchewan, 120 days a year."
It's part of the job description.
Cattle farmer: feed hay 120 days a year.
"If you can manage the grazing so that you can get that hay out, it greatly affects your bottom line because that's all mechanically harvested, stored..."
"When they're in the hay feeding season, whatever the time that is, is it necessary to supplement with grains or anything like that?"
That's what many beef raisers will tell you.
"And vigorously so, and deny that there's any other way that is possible or practical."
I wonder if you could address that?
"Pale skin shows through, where the intensely itchy animal's rubbed off 80% of its hair."
"These ghosts are sick, starving, and fatally anemic."
But the ticks live on.
Females remain dormant in the ground for weeks.
"In Africa, some species survive without food for much, much longer."
"In harsh environments, big mammals are few and far between."
So a tick finds a shady tree and heads underground to wait... and wait.
Ticks are ultimate survivors because they can sit waiting for a blood meal for ten years!
"We've seen ten of nature's toughest animals-- battling adversity for days, months, and years."
"But only the tick can survive without food for a decade, which is why it's number 1!"
even as I put it in my last incarnation:
"""Everybody's got something to lose except for me and my monkey"""
Hi!
How can we survive without overusing nature's resources?
It's of vital importance here to maintain a balance.
"This is what we examine in this unit, focusing on fishing-- trying to find the best strategy that serves both humans and nature."
"On the way there, we encounter some fundamental concepts of differential equations and in the larger fleet of simulation."

"Once again, I am so sorry."
That one doesn't know front from back.
"It would have been nice to have your son join us, as well."
"No, not at all."
He isn't my son at all.
"Since they couldn't pay me, I had no money to move,"
"I had to always go on foot, sometimes covering large distances."
Then I had two options:
Or I ate ...
Or paying service.
More often than not I ate!
"Therefore, the Ministry is not a choice, but it is something that is interlaced with your destiny and discover gradually that you grow up with God."
You can not escape.
"Then, I dedicated myself, and many more."
"I sweated, I cried, I gave blood for this Ministry."
"I asked for help, several times I've been betrayed, because well ... they are seen as a small anonymous preacher."
And then ...who wants to stand on the side of a poor failed?
"But in the end, you realize that from the evidence there is so much more and you don't stop, I can say that Gap was my life in these 12 years."
"It was what God used to form my character, and if I were to go back, confront all that I faced ...be called a beggar, a dreamer,"
"I'd never done anything, that I was a poor dumb because I was moving away from those ministries that would give me a lot."
I would do it all again.
Without thinking twice.
"Because I was granted the honour and grace to see lives reclamation, preparing Ministers fans who are not afraid of nothing, not even death."
"Then, Gap has been a passionate dedication of my heart."
Q:
Gap doesn't give you any financial support?
A:
No.
Q: are you working now?
"A: look, seeing the need that have the Gap, I always preferred full-time work.For this I've tried so far work .... but Gap does not remunerarmi, and I will soon find a job according to my education."
"The fact is that we always need a hand, this resource is our needs: we need more people possible, capable and with a real call. to help us."
"There are many cases of suicide in universities: people who have a desperate need, and what I need is not being able to do more."
It's always a drama to fail to muster enough people to do more.
"Q: you're invited to preach in other countries, travel a lot?"
A:
I've never traveled in my life.
"I preached a lot in Fortaleza, and I helped in the formation of leaders in these 10 years as a mentor."
Thirteenth year back at Western and I coached a couple years right out of college so it's nice to be hear in Macomb and at Western.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you were the team was picked to finish 8th in the Summit League
Pre-Season Polling.
You think the team will exceed these early expectations with such a young roster?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well it's kind of hard to tell you know the...the ranking system is based on the Fall results and you know we have a very young team very inexperienced team to start the year and I think that we'll play much bettter this Spring just having known who's going to be playing and a little more experience under our belts.
So I look forward to the competition
I'm not sure about exceeding expectations but were obviously are going to do our best.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now the team finished 10th tied with 11 place with Boise State in the Pat Hicks Thunderbird Invitational how do you think the team did there?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well you know it's the first...first term of the year we've been playing in February now for I think this is our 8th year and you never know what to expect there.
But we really had some bright...bright spots in that tournament.
Andrew Godfrey played very well.
Kurt Slattery who's a transfer this semester he played very well too.
And some of the young guys did fine.
Konrad Deka had 72 in the last round.
So we had some bright spots the finish wasn't as high as what we'd hoped but we try not to take those things into consideration to highly at this point in the year.
[Nick Spinozzi]
Now you have know returning seniors on the team.
In your coaching career have you had to deal with anything like that before with such a young roster that doesn't get to play that hasn't played that much?
[Coach Mel Blasi]
Well I don't I think it's more than just no seniors on the team.
We lost a lot of experience too.
So a lot of the players that we have this is their first collegiate experience.
It's different to not have seniors is one thing.
But to be going into the season knowing that you really didn't have anybody that have played the golf courses.
That really wasn't us to playing at the Division One level.
Those things are you know there's no substitute for experience.
I expect us to be a lot better just because of those things.
[Nick Spinozzi]
We are reaching out to friends and  communities who are doing the same.
This is not new.
"It's a really broad area, it covers a lot."
I do not think we could cover it all in 6 days.
I think you know.
What is special here is that we are face-to-face.
"We get to hear from a real living being and from our heart,  not on a website or something."
You'll have time also afterwards  to approach our wonderful friends.
So this is the living Dharma as they will speak from their experience.
The panel is a way of reaching out and connecting and collaborating with others.
"We are doing similar things, bringing and helping education,  improving the purpose of education and creating techniques  and methods to help teachers, students as well as their parents and the whole overall."
So we can just start with the classrooms and it will touch everything.
"That is the core  of our teacher's teachings, interbeing."
"When you touch one student, one teacher, naturally you will have to deal  with all the other issues."
So we have here today our panel  that represents a very diverse area and they will share  their personal journey and how they have come  to the point here.
"Without any further ado,  I introduce brother Richard here, a wonderful friend in our community."
He will be introducing each member.
Richard Brady is also  a retired math teacher and he has inspired many people.
Having him to come up here is a gift.
I met his student  who came to Plum Village.
After many years he came and  we asked him:
"""Why are you here?"""
"He said; ""I used to take a class."
"My math teacher is Richard Brady."""
"So you can see, just one student's experience in a class, how later on in life,  he confronted suffering and he remembered the teaching and came to learn more about the practice."
There are many stories like that  but I won't hold up the panel here.
Thank you for being with us.
(Richard Brady) Thank you brother.
It is my honor to introduce some old and new friends to you.
It is a privilege to hear from them this afternoon.
"Each will speak for  about 8 minutes, not very long, but we want to leave some time  for questions and answers at the end."
"So, just focus on them and if there is any questions that come up afterwards, be ready to ask them."
He's lazy.
And they gave kind of behavioral descriptions to something that wasn't behavioral at all.
"To be told over and over again, you're not quite cutting the mustard, it breaks down your self esteem."
And you have to go somewhere else to get your self esteem built up.
And kids get into trouble.
And they go looking for things that are more exciting than being told every day that you're dumb.
I think there's a huge payback for not providing kids with what they need.
"Just as the experts could have predicted, Adam turned to drugs and alcohol."
"When I drink, it's just to forget about everything."
"If I'm really having a tough time, I can't take this anymore, I just have to go drink some beers to let it all just get away."
There's been a lot of evidence of drug use.
"Continuously money being stolen, no matter where it was."
"We're kind of guilty of overlooking it, thinking, well, you know, so he needs some money."
"But when he gets into the thousands, you know, we've let it go too far."
And it got there.
"Then, one night, the phone call every parent dreads."
We get a phone call from the state police.
I thought he's getting ready to tell us that somebody been killed.
"I thought about, how do you plan a funeral for a kid who doesn't seem to want to be part of your family anymore, doesn't want to be a kid?"
Adam was safe but in deep trouble.
The police claimed that he had crashed a stolen car.
"The next morning, Terry took his 15-year-old son to the psychiatric ward at Boston Medical Center and had him committed."
I've had my son hospitalized to give him some attention.
"I mean, he could have been killed that night."
And he was out that night because he skipped school that day and didn't want to come home.
So he was out that night.
"I mean, how many more chances does he have?"
"After years of academic failure, Adam's slow, downward spiral was turning into every parent's nightmare, a teenager too far gone to rescue."
His parents will soon be confronted by that terrible prospect.
"But right now, the story of another young boy sending alarming signals that he is headed for trouble."
"His parents, desperate for help, can feel him slipping away."
"10-year-old Nathan Suggs lives in rural Bear Creek, North Carolina where he"
And it is really helpful for me as a teacher.
"I read once somewhere, that we make more decisions  during the course of our work day than any other professions  except surgeons."
No wonder we are so exhausted  at the end of the day.
"So, taking that time for me  with my students at the start of the classes  is tremendously helpful."
I also do deep relaxation with them.
"I actually only want to do it  once every two weeks because of training, we have so much  that we need to go through, but they put together a petition  that said ""We want deep relaxation at least once a week""."
"Beginning anew is another practice  that you are going to learn about, and I use that to mediate conflict and  also I use it with my students when I want one-on-one conference with them."
"So, we have a clean slate with each other and also own up for any unskillfulness I've had."
That is the authenticity piece.
"Naming, when you yourself  as a teacher have been unskillful,"
I think it is really powerful.
"The practice of loving kindness, often times, I also start the class with that."
"I'm really happy... (Bell) to be here and hear more questions about integrating practice into classroom, you can feel free to find me anytime."
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Meena."
"Our third speaker is Michele Chaban,  also from the University of Toronto."
"She is co-founder and co-director of the Inter-professional Applied  Mindfulness Meditation Certificate, which has five different strands,  it is a very large program."
She is the one who got it going.
"Michele, why don't you share with us?"
"(Michele Chaban) Good afternoon everybody, I'd like to begin with offering a blessing to you, for those of you who are teachers formally and for the rest of us  who teach informally."
May you be well.
May you be healthy.
May you be whole everyday.
May you be happy.
May you be supported  from within and above you.
"And may you continue  with your good work, because together we will change the world."
I am so pleased to be here  with you today.
"I guess we have been asked to speak  a little bit about ourselves,so here I go."
I used to be a model for Elizabeth Art  in Canada and it was a wonderful life.
"And one day, a drunk-driver ran into me  and took my legs and my arms away from me."
"And in years that ensued,  I lost my ability to talk and walk."
I kept my mind andI lost my body.
And science didn't have the resources to be able to help heal me and I waited.
"Look, I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not, but do you realize you've shot in every state?"
"You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing, you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry."
"You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"""
"I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye, dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers."
"I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day."
"""And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively, it might be time to think about it."
"Because, dude, you know, four years."""
"You know, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin, thoughts are bouncing around."
"And, after that shoot, Dirty Jobs really didn't change, in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally."
"And now, when I talk about the show,"
I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.
"I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things I got wrong, some of the other notions of work that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct, and they're not."
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.
"As a group, they're the happiest people I know."
"And I don't want to start whistling ""Look for the Union Label,"" and all that happy worker crap."
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people who do unthinkable work.
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work.
I swear to God --
I did it with them.
They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.
And I see it over and over and over again.
So I started to wonder what would happen if we challenged some of these sacred cows.
Follow your passion -- we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?
Probably the worst advice I ever got.
(Laughter)
"You know, follow your dreams and go broke, right?"
"I mean, that's all I heard growing up."
"I didn't know what to do with my life, but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out."
"I can give you 30 examples, right now --"
"Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos and feeds them them to his swine."
Why?
"I have a speech prepared, but..."
I don't know if it's for the toast.
I didn't know I was gonna lead the toast.
[laughter]
Be prepared next time!
[laughter]
Bring your walking legs.
[laughter mixed with gasps]
Okay.
Now this is something uhh...
"I didn't know I was gonna give a speech today, but"
"I happen to type at 30,000 words per minute, so... in the time that I was up there I quickly whipped something up for you, Bayley and Megan."
"I promise you, it will be the most touching thing you've ever heard in your entire life."
[laughter]
More touching than the vows?
Yes.
[laughter]
Fornication such as this...!
Wait... [hesitant laughter]
"For an occasion such as this, it is very important to recognize the people that put their time and effort into making this a reality."
"So thank you... me, for working to make sure that this thing went off with out a hitch... power issues aside."
I wasn't a part of that.
"And thank you, me, for almost making it right on time for the rehersal."
"And thank you, me, most of all for taking time away from myself to recognize the efforts of the little people - Megan, this isn't a dig at you, don't worry, those are coming later, but instead I mean all the people that weren't me and still gave their (less important) time and energy to... decorating..."
"This means to clap, monkeys."
[applause and laughter] feeding us all... [applause]
"and finally, thanks to you for having me here, which lets face it, was  the most important thing to happen today."
"Now, as many of you already know, my name is David Sprague."
"And, as many of you have felt strangely compelled to point out, some of you doing so cruelly within ear shot of the groom, I am the best man here today."
"Don't get me wrong, I understand that I am great, but come on people; this is supposed to be Bayley's special day."
"He has had to hear just how great I am every single day since well before he even met me, so can we please just give him one day free of constant reminders that I am better than him?"
"For those of you that haven't been to a wedding, this is normally the part of the best man speech where I would point out that the groom is actually the best man here because the bride is marrying him instead of the person titled ""best man"", me."
"When x is equal to 0, why is equal to 0."
So the y intercept is 0.
So we know that this has a form y is equal to mx where m is a slope.
Let's figure out the slope.
Slope is equal to change in y for a given change in x or change in y over change in x.
"So when we increase x by 1, how much are we increase-- or decrease y by?"
Well then y increases by 2.
"So we could say that equals y changes by 2, by plus 2 when x changes by plus 1."
"So we get the slope is equal to 2, so the equation of this"
line is y is equal to 2x.
Which is choice B.
Next problem.
Which point lies on the line defined by 3x plus 6y is equal to 2?
Well the best thing to do is just probably to substitute these numbers in for x and y and see which one works.
"Changes to Rumble, Urgot, Cho'Gath, and the Tribunal, covered in this episode of the Patch Preview."
"Welcome, summoners."
"I'm Phreak and I'm here with Morello, Lead Champion Designer."
Together we'll be discussing some gameplay changes coming into the next update for League of Legends.
"While this video does not cover every single change, it will explain the thought process behind some of our decisions."
Rumble seemingly came out of nowhere and was suddenly an overpowered champion.
"In this patch, we'll be lowering the damage amplification from being in the Danger Zone as well as reducing the damage of Flamespitter."
"What's the story here, Morello?"
"We over-buffed Rumble in the Jayce patch, but no one really saw that change because we didn't do any other balance changes with that patch."
Basically we did a bug-fix that made Flamespitter more reliable so you'd get full damage out of the spell more often.
The damage on Flamespitter was extremely high and was balanced for when it was broken.
We're bringing the damage value to something that's much more reasonable for the way it behaves now.
"We really like the Danger Zone gameplay, but we had to re-evaluate the numbers on it."
"You'll still feel good for using Danger Zone effectively, but not 30% stronger good."
Last patch we gave Urgot a whole slew of nerfs aimed at his ability ranges and damages.
"This patch, we're reverting the damage change on Acid Hunter, meaning its base damage is going back up and the attack damage ratio is going back down."
Why are we reverting this change?
Our goal when balancing champions to let them shine in their own special niche.
The film begins as a proper horror film with this mysterious ghostly ship coming through the mists.
"And the score cycles through all of it's motifs; there is a suspense score, and there is a mysterious music track."
"And then, The extra-diagetic music goes away and we start to listen to what's on the set of this dock."
And that's where things start to get interesting.
So let's watch and listen to how Robson and Lewton set up sound at the beginning of Ghost Ship.
[music]
It's the beginning of our score.
[music]
And now we hear the harpsichord and the blind man off screen.
What we see are these knives.
So that violent motif is set up right away.
And there's a distance between what we see and what we hear. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [music]
"Me, give me some time to blow the man down. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Good luck. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Thank you, sir."
"Being a sailor, you'll need luck."
"A young sailor, too. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Now so, the blind man cannot see, but he hears very well."
Speaker:[inaudible] &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And he seems to speak the truth.
"He knows that a hero is an officer by the sound of his bag, that will come in a moment."
"And he also knows that this is a bad ship. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; You've got a blind man's tricks for telling what men are like, but ships [inaudible]. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; So, it begins with this foreboding of a man who cannot see but hears, and as our hero walks up the plank listen."
"Blow the Man Down, the song reappears."
Now Blow the Man Down is an interesting song.
It's a song about beating a sailor who's been insubordinate and it's also a song about ships on rough seas.
There's a song of great foreboding and terror.
"And yet it's introduced gently here as though it's just a man singing about a, a quaint song about going out to sea."
"Now, things get even stranger and more interesting when we are introduced to Finn."
So listen to how the music works at this moment.
Speaker:[music]
I'm the third officer.
Where can I find the Captain? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; There's our knife again.
Gestures with the knife.
"Now watch when we cut around, and listen to the music."
[music]
"Hear that as that smoke comes in, we get the mysterium theme."
He's probably not going to be real happy with you.
"So, you know, just, keep, keep that kind of thing in mind."
"You're dealing with, with people's emotions."
"Another thing another aspect of, for consideration, with respect to risk acceptance is benchmarking."
"So, there's got to be, a, an explicit acknowledgement by top management with respect to what, what level of risk the organization is willing to accept."
"Now, you guys all work for organizations with, with a, with a few exceptions for which this sort of thing should be happening."
How many of you are aware of what management has specified as being the risk tolerance of your organization?
Not even one?
[LAUGH]
Okay.
"So, I mean, that's, that's kind of scary."
That's kind of scary.
"Cuz if you don't know what the risk tolerance is, how can you put a framework in place, that's going to achieve managements expectations?"
"You're shooting in the dark, right?"
"And you know, you're not going to fix it over night, but just something to, to be aware of."
[INAUDlBLE]
They have no tolerance.
"They, they were all went through it out."
"A fool proof, a fool proof system."
Towards somewhere else.
Sorry.
[INAUDlBLE]
"Somewhere, somewhere else, I'm serious."
They work somewhere else.
What has been mandated Yeah.
"Because that's what where, that."
Before you cannot possibly accomplish.
"No, but they announced it publicly."
You can't fail.
"How much did they announced that can't fail, control?"
"Yeah. , I mean, you know, realistically, you're probably, you know, it's easy for me to say, you know, go work somewhere else."
"But, if you think about the fact that everything about your job, both the tangible and intangible rewards can ultimately be tied to how well you achieve management's objectives."
- And where else can you be found on the Internet?
Twitter? facebook?
"- Well, my Facebook account already died, but"
"I am always on Twitter. @FioreAlvarez, you find me there all the time."
"- Do you have some anecdote in your blogger - twitter experience, that you could highlight?"
"- Well, something really funny always happens to us because to every event we go, we devirtualize with the people."
"And it is really funny, because you are talking for 20-30 min. with a person, and suddenly you say, Hi I am Fiori Alvarez and the person gets surprised - ""really? so nice!"
"I follow you""."
"So, the relationship becomes so personal that you end up being a friend of a lot of people but, real friends, real solid friendships, as in 2.0 as in ????"
- Thank you Fiorela
"Now, given all this I will now draw a number of pie charts."
I want you to select the one that most closely resembles the distribution over here.
"Just for clarity, party A is depicted in red and party B in blue."
Please select exactly one of those pie charts.
"Basically, there are four methods for conducting a risk analysis."
"And, some of them come out of various guidelines."
ISO has this 13335 standard.
I don't know how many of you are you familiar with that one.
"You know, the one you hear a most about is, you know, 17799 which has now evolved into 27001."
"But, 13335 is guidelines for management of IT security."
"And, these four options that I'm going to talk about are, are, are out of that standard."
And the first one is called the baseline approach.
"And, what the baseline approach does is have you apply a set of controls to achieve some baseline level of protection for all systems."
"And, oftentimes, it's called a gap analysis."
"So, and I'll show, actually, I think it's the very next slide."
"I'll, I'll show you."
I was going to draw a picture.
"But I'll,"
I'll just show you the picture on the next slide.
It should look a lot better than the one I would draw.
"And the list of controls, as you would guess, given that"
ISO promulgated the guidelines for management by security is in the ISO 27001.
"And near the ha nd, the garage is going to be low ends contracted."
"So, the garage is going to be even narrower than it really is."
"So, in the ladder frame we obtain the following picture and the two seem to be in conflict."
"In the picture on the left, the"
ladder is in the garage.
"In the picture on the right, there is no way the ladder could be in the garage cuz the garage is even shorter than its rest length which is as it is shorter than a ladder as we see at the top."
"You can make the puzzle sharper by saying, imagine that at the instant over here on the frame on the left where the ladder is inside the garage, I closed both doors."
What happens then?
Now
I have a ladder in the garage.
"Well, now it's not ambiguous."
The doors are closed.
"So, let's resolve this issue. there is, as always no real paradox."
There's only confusion.
"And the confusion, as I said, is always to do with simultaneity."
"And,"
I'll solve this problem twice.
"The first time, algebraically, using Lorentz"
Transformation.
"And then, I'll demonstrate, graphically how this solution works and along the way, play with space time diagrams, and what we can or cannot read off of them."
But I want to convince you that Lorentz Transformations are useful.
"So, to use Lorentz Transformations, what we do is, we have to be very careful that we're not talking about wishy-washy things, we want to be very specific about what are the things we're talking about."
"And the things we talk about are events, things that happened."
"And they happened a particular place, at a particular time."
"So what are the things we know? in order to use coordinates, I'm going to set up my usual space time diagram if you want, or my coordinates."
I'm going to have the black coordinates presenting the garage because
I'm thinking of the garage as at rest.
And the latter is moving to the right and its coordinates as seen by the garage are t prime and x prime.
I have to pick an origin for each of these.
"So I will pick the left end of the garage, remember the"
ladder is moving to the right.
So the left end of the garage is going to be the origin for coordinates on the garage.
"He was, I think, a great friend to students across the campus."
NARRATOR:
"Although Ed retired in 1991, he and his wife Dory remained close to the university."
"He and Dory are longtime season ticket holders for Matador Athletics, and are loyal supporters of the library and the arts."
Ed was named Honorary Lifetime Director of the Alumni Association and was instrumental in helping the association create and enhance its support for current students through its legacy and first generation scholarship programs.
"In 2000 Ed was presented with the university's inaugural Emeriti Merit Award, which the Alumni Association renamed in 2008 as the Dean Edmund Peckham Award, to honor Ed's impact on five decades of student life at Cal State Northridge."
ANTHONY:
I think I go back 43 years with Ed.
That's a long time.
I don't think I'm gonna go through with anybody else for 43 more years of my life.
(Music Plays)
Let's see if we can take the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x power.
"And you might say, hold on a second."
We know how to take the derivative of e to the x.
But what about a base like 2?
We don't know what to do with 2.
And the key here is to rewrite 2 to the x so that we essentially have it as e to some power.
And the key there is to rewrite 2.
So how can we rewrite 2 so it is e to some power?
"Well, let's think about what e to the natural log of 2 power is."
The natural log of 2 is the power that I would have to raise e to to get to 2.
"So if we actually raise e to that power, we are going to get to 2."
"So what we could do, instead of writing 2 to the x, we could rewrite this as e."
"We could rewrite 2 as e to the natural log of 2, and then raise that to the x power."
So this is the x power in yellow.
And so let's do that right over here.
"So instead of taking the derivative with respect to x of 2 to the x, let's say, let's just take the derivative with respect to x of the exact same expression rewritten, of e to the natural log of 2 raised to the x power."
"Let me put this x in that same color, dx."
"Now we know from our exponent properties if we raise something to some power, and then raise that to another power, we can take the product of the two powers."
Let me rewrite this just to remember.
"If I have a to b, and then I raise that to the c power, this is the exact same thing as a to the b times c power."
Still today the number one  cash crop in the world.
"And it's the best crop for keeping indigenous people in the jungle, so that we don't cut down our sacred forests."
"Every time you choose to buy chocolate, organic chocolate, and or,  what I prefer -- raw chocolate, you are voting with your money  to save the rain forest, and it is a vote that counts."
It's the best vote you can have.
It grows in a little pod.
What an interesting looking plant.
It grows right off the trunk.
The fruit does.
And inside -- there's the flower.
This is the glory of chocolate.
Look at the different colors there.
Inside we see this.
"These are the cacao nuts,  or the beans, or the nut that all chocolate is made out of inside."
And around each nut is a white pulp.
"And that pulp was traditionally  in Amazonia and Central America where chocolate is from,  was only eaten by women."
But men ate the nut on the inside.
This is what that pulp looks like.
That's what we call 'The best day ever'.
"When you have that much chocolate,  real chocolate, original chocolate, raw chocolate, the fruit than nut,  the pulp, everything, but you gotta watch out,  because all the creatures in the forest eat it."
"And in fact, it is known that if you have a forest with 140 species of different birds then when you put a cacao orchard in, and you put it right into the jungle; no trees are taken out,  nothing is cut down."
"You take your little baby cacao plants or ""chocolate trees"", you put them right in the forest, and that will attract at least  40 more species of birds."
Birds love to hang out in chocolate trees.
"It comes back to this; the coin of the realm, the great cacao bean."
The secret inside.
We had an amazing discovery early on.
"In that, that cacao bean, the thing  that all chocolate is made out of, is the highest antioxidant food in the world."
This was a discovery.
This was not known ten years ago.
It is known now.
"Chocolate contains 15 times  the amount of antioxidants as wild blueberries, 20 times the antioxidants  as what's in green tea, 30 times the antioxidants as red wine."
"All of those pigments of color,  that are captured, that beautiful purple color that's the antioxidants;  it's actually the color."
And the brown of chocolate  is the polyphenols that protect yourselves and actually  protect you from aging.
Sometimes it is cheaper to buy five little packets of something than to buy one that includes five in the bigger one.
"And like I said, you don't think that that is the way it is going to be, but sometimes buying smaller times the number you need is more cost-effective than buying larger."
"And, if you go to looking you will see that they are doing that more and more now."
Okay?
So something to watch out for.
Then your chapter talks a little bit about warranties and you need to make sure and read those.
I'll tell you we don't buy a whole lot of warranties.
"Usually vehicles, products"
last as long as whatever warranty they are going to sell you.
"So, or whatever warranty comes free."
Usually it is going to make it that far.
I have found that computers is one exception.
We have bought warranties on computers.
When you use them you take them in.
"You know you are at college, you don't have your computer for a couple of months, I don't know."
"As cheap as things get, you just have to weigh the cost of buying a warranty and look at what all it is going to cover."
"Now, the next thing it talks about, it talks about researched based buying."
So many times instead of researching something we just go out and buy it.
"We decide, Oh, I would like to have a new TV !"
"Okay, let's go buy one."
"No, you need to do some research based buying."
Now four phases.
First the
Pre-shopping Activity.
There are things you do before you ever get there.
"Secondly, Evaluating The Alternatives Phase."
Then the Selection and Purchase Phase.
And then the Post-purchase Activities.
And there is a great deal of information given on all four of these different steps.
But phase I. If you will look on page 194 as you are gathering information there on the left you see key websites for consumer product information.
These are places you can go to learn about a product.
And these are from organizations that don't sell advertisements.
The same count rate.
"It doesn't sound like a very interesting experiment, but at that time he was working with a person named Geiger, a post-doc named Geiger."
The same Geiger as the Geiger counter.
And Geiger wasn't too happy about the results of these experiments.
"And in addition,"
Geiger had this undergraduate student hanging around the lab.
This undergraduate named Marsden.
And Marsden was really excited about doing science.
He just hung around there.
He really wanted to do something.
"And Geiger was, jeez, what am I going to do with this guy?"
"Geiger goes to Rutherford and says I've got Marsden here, he really wants to do something, what should I do with him?"
"And Rutherford said well, okay, let's have him build a detector that can swing around that gold sample."
"Let's have him build a detector that will rotate around such that the detector can be positioned this way, so that we can look for any alpha particles that might be backscattered, backscattered meaning scattered back in the direction from which they came."
"And Geiger said ah-ha, this will keep this guy busy and not in my hair."
No problem.
"So he goes down to Marsden,"
Marsden is all excited to build this detector.
"He builds the detector and gets Geiger, okay, we're ready to go."
Let's try this.
And so they put the radium bromide there in this arrangement.
"They're sitting there at the detector and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, particles at the detector."
"And they go, oh, well, that must just be a general background."
"So what they do then is they take this gold foil away, so that presumably all the particles are going in that direction and they listen and they hear nothing."
And they put the gold foil back.
"And they listen and they hear tick, tick, tick, etc., 20 alpha particles per minute."
"And they then pick another foil, platinum foil, basically the same result."
"They go up to Rutherford, they get him down in the laboratory."
"Rutherford's looking over their shoulder, tick, tick, tick, etc."
"Hey, there are some alpha particles coming off."
Not many.
So I guess the books get stacked that way.
"And they labeled this right here, this dimension is x."
"And they're saying, will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia fit upright in the book rack shown above?"
So essentially I'm going to put the first 10 in there.
"So the first statement they say, is that x is equal to 50 centimeters."
"Well, that doesn't help me because I don't know how big the first 10 volumes of the encyclopedia are."
"If each of them are, at least the first 10 are,"
"less than 5 centimeters each or on average less than 5 centimeters, then maybe I could fit them."
But one by itself doesn't help me.
Two:
12 of the volumes have an average thickness of 5 centimeters.
"Well, that doesn't help me either because remember, they're saying will the first 10 volumes of a 20 volume encyclopedia?"
"Maybe the 12 that have an average thickness of 5 centimeters, maybe those are the volumes 8 through 20 and maybe volumes 1 through 7 have an average thickness of 50 centimeters each or 5 million centimeters each."
So even both of these conditions combined don't help me know if I can definitely fit the first 10 volumes of the 20 volume encyclopedia.
So that is E.
Both statements together are still not sufficient.
Problem 39.
A circular tub--
"OK, so they've drawn this circular-looking tub."
So the top looks like that.
And then there's two sides.
Let's me see how well I can construct what they've drawn.
And the bottom looks something like that.
"And then they shade in a little area, a strip of this, like that."
And they say a circular tub has a painted band has a band painted around its circumference as show above.
So this is the painted band around its circumference.
What is the surface area of the painted band?
And they tell us that the height of the painted band is x.
"So in order to essentially know the surface area, you'd have to know the height, which is x, times the circumference of the circle,"
Right? which would be the length.
"So if you knew the height times circumference of the circle, you'd be able to know the surface area."
"So they tell us, the first statement, x is equal to 0.5, whatever, meters."
"Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he is one rich pig farmer, and he is good for the environment, and he spends his days doing this incredible service, and he smells like hell, but God bless him."
He's making a great living.
"You ask him, ""Did you follow your passion here?"" and he'd laugh at you."
"The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm and turned it down, outside of Vegas."
He didn't follow his passion.
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going and he went the other way.
And I hear that story over and over.
"Matt Froind, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut, who woke up one day and realized the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk, if he could use it to make these biodegradable flower pots."
"Now, he's selling them to Walmart."
Follow his passion?
The guy's -- come on.
"So I started to look at passion,"
"I started to look at efficiency versus effectiveness -- as Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction."
"I started to look at teamwork and determination, and basically all those platitudes they call ""successories"" that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now."
That stuff -- it's suddenly all been turned on its head.
Safety -- safety first?
"Going back to, you know, OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society: what if OSHA got it wrong?"
"I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say -- but what if it's really safety third?"
Right?
(Laughter)
"No, I mean really."
"What I mean to say is I value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that I'm working with, but the ones who really get it done, they're not out there talking about safety first."
"They know that other things come first -- the business of doing the work comes first, the business of getting it done."
"And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea, I was on a crab boat with the ""Deadliest Catch"" guys -- which I also work on -- in the first season."
We're about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:
"50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?"
"Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen, and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down."
"So, I'm 40 feet off the deck, which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know, and it's doing this in the ocean."
Unspeakably dangerous.
"I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse and I say, with some level of incredulity,"
"""Captain, OSHA."""
"And he says, ""OSHA?"
"Yes, if you're trying to do like a full blown formatter, then you actually do need to worry about the position."
"- The point of the Wonder Helpers, by the way, is that formatters you can only...well, from the binding, from binding, you can only use them on components that expose a formatter finding."
Wonder Helpers you can use on any binding.
- That's nice.
- I don't think I've used those.
- You should because you steal them.
- I will.
"- Right, right."
You can have multiple...
- They can be extended into something else.
- I usually just chain the formatter instances.
- No instances.
- We won't go there.
"OK, so, moving on to our final topic, I think we're, are we out of time Pascal, or Keep going.?"
"Deployment, trying to get through here quickly."
There's really not much to say about deployment that hasn't been said in other places.
"Manage dependencies, plan for change."
It's going to happen.
"Web Object extensions directory sounded like a great idea when it first came out, jammed all kinds of jars in there."
It was wonderful.
Then I needed to update one app in the server and I couldn't update the other apps and it was terrible.
"For deployment, my advice is just delete everything in that directory."
It's just a dependency nightmare waiting to happen.
"Instead, if you need it, if you need jar files, put them in a framework, use the framework in your application."
Framework goes into your subversion repository wherever your repository is.
Manage the dependencies like that.
"In fact, I'll go one further and say,"
"""You should embed all frameworks."""
"All frameworks, I include the Web Objects ones as well because that way you can deploy applications using different versions of Web Objects, different versions of the jars on the same server."
You don't have to worry about conflicts.
"And Yeah, people are going to say,"
"""Oh, it's going to be bigger."
(robotic voice) How do you feel?
(robotic voice) How do you feel?
I do not understand the question
What is it Spock?
I do not understand the question Mother
You are half human.
The computer knows that.
The question is irrelevant.
Spock...
"The retraining of your mind has been in the Vulcan way, so you may not understand feelings."
"But as my son, you have them."
They will surface.
"As you wish, since you deem them of value."
But I cannot wait here to find them.
Where must you go?
To Earth.
To offer testimony.
You do this -- for friendship?
"I do this because I was there,"
Spock.
Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one?
I would accept that as an axiom.
"Then you stand here alive because of a mistake made by your flawed, feeling, human friends."
They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the one
-you- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
"They do, indeed."
"Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and it's Wednesday, time for some YouTube tips and advice and this week I want to talk about the new YouTube trailer option that we had to add to our new one channel design that had rolled out like a couple of weeks ago."
"I've actually already talked about this on the ReelSEO channel which you can click right here and go watch that, but I want to take it a little bit further this time, because what I said there is some things that I have observed about what makes channel trailers work well and what kind of doesn't, just based on the limited, you know, interaction I seen with them across several channels that have already implemented it."
And now YouTube's coming out with some best practices that they are seeing as well and actually almost everything I said in that original video is also what YouTube is saying so I feel a little bit proud of myself about that.
But let's look at what they say and then I have another tip to add to the end that I think is very vital and crucial that they don't include.
"But first of all, the first thing they say is to have a very clear call to action to subscribe."
"If you did capture them, which we did occasionally, you could use it until it runs out."
"But without a code sheet, you would have to break the code."
And you would have to do that with mathematics.
-What was the key?
What was wrong with Enigma?
What was its weakness?
DR. JAMES GRlME:
Let's have a look at what the flaw is in the Enigma machine.
"So the Germans thought it was unbreakable, but there is a flaw."
If I press a letter K--
"For this quiz, your goal is to define a procedure."
We'll call it abbaize.
"This is very useful if you need to come up with names, and what it does is take 2 strings as its inputs and outputs a string that is the first input, followed by 2 repetitions of the second input, followed by the first input."
"As an example, if we called abbaize, passing in the string 'a' and the string 'b'-- single character strings-- what we should get as a result is the string 'abba'."
"If we called abbaize, passing in the string 'dog' and the string 'cat', what we should get is the string 'dogcatcatdog', and there aren't any spaces between the strings."
They're just all pasted together.
"Ermira, you have led the session many times, what would you say about it?"
This is the last chance you have as a trainer to do teaching practice actually.
"And it's your last chance to make sure that all the participants have understood correctly the importance that children should have to make this working groups alone or in pairs or working as a group of five or more, depending on the number of children they have."
"But in the same time, it's the last chance for them as well, for the participants, to make sure that they can prove to themselves that they can do it and can demonstrate they can use this techniques."
Then let's plan together.
Do you agree to plan together to see what kind of supplies we can make for work?
The following incident is a reenactment.
Professional actors will depict different characters in each episode.
"(BEEP, BEEP, BEEP, BEEP)"
"ME, ME, ME"
It's my day off.
I can't reach it.
Ugh.
(And there was another drive-by shooting today...)
"Blah, blah, blah!"
Get to the weather already.
"And you can see that in 2000s that 1.3 percent or yeah, 1.3 percent gap basically doubled to 2.5 percent gap in the next decade."
Health care cost mushroomed.
"Now, this is a somewhat complicated slide but I just talked to you about the fact that o ver four decades, we've have this big growth."
Basically 2.4 percent above the growth in the GDP in health care.
Taking more and more and more of the GDP into health care arena.
This is projected by the Congressional Budget Office into the future.
It's not all health care spending.
It's just federal health care spending which is predominantly what?
Medicare but also have a big portion of Medicaid.
And this is to see what happens if there is no excess cost quote.
"That means, if healthcare cost which I haven't done in 40 years equal GDP."
That solid line here is what happens over basically the next 25 years if health care cost do not rise any faster than the growth of GDP and what do you see?
Just interpret the graph.
What do you see?
It's still growing right?
"This is a percentage GDP, Medicare and the Federal portion here is about five percent and you can see, it goes over eight%, 8-1/25 in 25 years."
"This in the GDP, if it doesn't exceed GDP."
"If it exceed GDP by two percent which is slightly less and what has been doing in the last 40 years, you can see it balloons past ten, eleven%."
"And if it has slowing growth down to 1.7 percent points, okay?"
You can see that it still goes over ten%.
"So, the federal budget contribution to health care is extremely."
"Dependent on how much healthcare grows above GDP but even if it doesn't grow above GDP, it's going to be bigger and bigger drag on the federal budget, okay?"
"This is one reason people who are budget [inaudible], who worry about the healthcare, worry about the federal budget."
The predominant worry is not social security but healthcare.
"We're going to do a few international comparisons so that you could get a feel for how our healthcare spending compares to the rest and well, as [inaudible] percent, how mush more does the US spend on healthcare than the number two country in the world?"
"32%, say 30 percent were third higher."
"32%, say, 50 percent of quarter, say, 40%."
"Before we get there, who is the next highest country in the world?"
"It's Norway, that's right."
They are number two.
"And they spent we spent rough, they, we're at 50 percent higher than what they spend."
Look at this graph.
"I had two speedlights in the background, one just hanging under the ceiling, attached to a ceiling lamp."
The other one standing on the floor.
"Both shooting into the background, exposing the background so that it's white."
The mannequin standing in the middle in front of it.
The main light coming from left and right.
It's exactly the same setup left and right.
It's a white shoot through umbrella at roughly a height of 1.60 meter.
"Both speedlights, left and right, are on 1/4th, and because I don't want to have a harsh contrast, (there should be nothing in the shadows),"
I also have a fill light right above the camera.
"It's also going through an umbrella, filling in whatever shadows there could be."
"The camera is just on standard settings 1/200s, f/11 for nice sharpness, ISO 200 for good quality."
And that's pretty much it.
"The white balance is set to ""flash"" however, don't trust the white balance."
"I mean, if you do catalogue photos you really really need to have an accurate white balance."
"So shoot with a grey card, ideally even shoot with a color calibration target"
like the color checker passport or something.
"But at least you need a neutral gray target like a gray card, or I used this gray cube and that helps for having exactly the correct white balance."
You really need that.
Alright.
What other tips to I have for you?
"Before you put the clothes onto the mannequin, iron them!"
Use a steam iron.
"It is so much easier to iron clothes, iron out the folds in the clothes with a steam iron than it is to iron them out in photoshop later on."
So do it upfront.
Another thing:
"When you are shooting trousers, put the mannequin up onto a stool."
"That way you don't shoot so much ground, the paper that you have on the ground or whatever floor there is, you are shooting the trousers against the white backdrop."
Just like you shoot the jumpers or the sweaters or whatever you have.
That's already it.
I mean it is really simple.
It's that simple.
"So if you haven't done such a shoot, now you don't have any excuse anymore."
"They, I'm sure you know, their paper has improved as a result of this."
"Right, right."
"So you know, that, that does not hurt."
"It's everybody's instinct, I think to at first be a little defensive when you get your review back."
Yeah.
Because you have to go back and.
Yeah.
Tweak the language a little bit.
"Right, right."
"To make sure your, you know polite."
"That's a good tip, yeah."
And can you give us some words of encouragement for young scientists who might have submitted their first paper and actually got an outright rejection?
"Can you, what are some words of encouragement?"
"Well, I would just say, fix it and if it's totally rejected by that journal, their not asking for resubmission, fix it."
"Try to respond to the reviewers comments that you feel are justified, and submit it elsewhere, and persist."
"I've had my, as an author, I've had to submit papers to as many as four journals til the, finally got accepted."
So I think persistence is important.
Don't take the rejection personally.
"It's hard not to, and I sometimes do, but you realize that some reviewers may not be very competent, may not really understand what you're doing."
This will often happen if you've submit[ted].
Epidemiologic paper and it gets reviewed by a clinician who does not really understand.
Um-hm.
Principles of epidemiology.
"They'll feel that if you write a paper about stroke if, if every case was not reviewed by a neurologist then it's not a valid paper."
Right.
"So or, or maybe they're competent but just had a bad day and, and didn't really pay close attention to what you wrote and miss some passages that really would have answered their questions."
"So just realize that reviewers are human, just like you just like authors and, And."
That's just the way the system works.
"Yeah, yeah."
It's not perfect.
And then talking about the system a little bit.
"You know, what changes do you anticipate are gonna occur in the publication process?"
"God was throwing thunderbolts down like Zeus in the cartoons, but churches, they built churches on hills as shining beacons."
"And, as such, they attracted lightning bolts."
"And when these churches were hit by lightning, it often destroyed them, and a lot of bellringers got killed from that lighning."
"And the clergy, who were doing their best to suck up to god were at a loss to explain how this was going on."
What was happening here?
Why did god dislike them so much?
"So, based on his understanding of electricity, Ben Franklin, who was a deist, solved the problem with his lightning rod, and his lightning redirection system in 1749."
"And, today, all churches, lo and behold, have lightning rods."
"Yet, they claim god is still protecting them."
I find that amusing.
What about rainbows?
"Well, in Genesis 9:11, we have god talking to Noah."
This is right after the flood.
"And god says, 'And I will my covenant with you."
Neither shall flesh be cut anymore by the waters of the flood.
"Neither shall there be flood to destroy the earth.' And god said,"
"'This is a token of my covenant, which I make between me and you and every"
living creature that is with you for perpetual generations.
"I do set my bow on the cloud, and it shall be forever a token of the covenant between me and the earth.'"
"So, according to the bible, rainbows are a remembrance of god's promise not to kill everything on the planet again."
-Promise not to kill again with a flood.
He can kill it again in other ways.
- Okay.
"And you can contrast this rather silly kindof creepy story with the Feynman lectures on physics, where Richard Feynman explained how and why rainbows appear the way they do."
"And he worked out the angles and the diffraction of the light and all this good stuff, and there's no psychopathic connotations and there's a lot of beauty."
And that's what science has done instead.
"So, materials science."
"So, say you're god and you wanted to communicate a message to humanity."
"And if you wanted to write something on a slate or a tablet, and you wanted it to last for centuries, you might use sapphire-coated titanium."
That might be a good choice for a writing surface to send a message.
-I'm down with that.
"The thing is I'm pretty sure if I'm a god, and"
One last thing about prerequisites.
Algebra and Statistics are other formal subject matters that we need and I think even this for everything.
"With so much data available on anything under the sun, knowing Algebra and Statistics is very important, and I hope my treatment of the s ubject matter will motivate you to learn a lot more."
Rather than seeing it as a hurdle to understanding things.
So these are the formal things you could think about.
But don't worry about it.
"As I said, if you have curiousity and a bad attitude."
"And a bad attitude is one which says, you know, give me anything."
"I'll, I'll handle it."
"If you have that attitude, you will do very well in this class, and you'll learn a ton."
"Not just in this class, in life."
"And so, bring that attitude, and we'll be fine."
"Now, I'll talk about something that's very important and it's called Pedagogy."
How do I conduct the class?
"This class, because of the value of Finance being both theory, framework, and practical, is all driven by problem solving."
"I will always force you to do problems, because that's how you learn."
What does that mean?
Everything I introduce in class will not be preceded by a formula.
"Finance is a lot of Algebra, a"
lot of formulas but I will always tell you why we are doing something not what it's all about.
"Why is far more important in life than the what, the what you can"
Google right?
"So if you can Google and get what I'm providing you in the class, I'm not providing you much."
"So because Finance is applied, we'll emphasize problem solving, and everything will be introduced with an example."
"However, I want you to recognize that you have to do most of the work."
"I'm a coach, you have to do the work."
"I hope I'm a good coach and I motivate you and give you the main issues you need to worry about, right?"
"In life, there are not that many issues, four or five."
One is love.
"The rest is, kinda follows a little bit."
Number two is financing my book.
"But anyway, so you'll be doing assignments every week and I encourage you whether they're called quizzes or not, quizzes or assignment, do them."
"At this time though, the end results are dark in the viewport."
"Unlike Mental Mill, 3ds Max does not have a ""Brightness"" shader."
"Instead, you use the Gamma/Gain shader from the mental ray maps rollout."
You need to insert that node by dragging &amp;amp; dropping it on the connection  between the Phong illumination Node and the Map to Conversion node.
You can then adjust the Gamma/Gain parameters to suit your liking.
"If you wish, create a similar shader tree for the eyes,  using the supplied bitmaps."
"As you can see, building metaSL shader trees in 3ds Max  is a simple process."
It is not as elaborate as Mental Mill but does provide you  with the basic tools to build simple shader trees.
"If you are interested in Mental Mill, you can view the How-To movie  entitled:"
How to Use Mental Mill.
I do want to test this question we're all interested in:
Does extinction have to be forever?
I'm focused on two projects I want to tell you about.
One is the Thylacine Project.
"The other one is the Lazarus Project, and that's focused on the gastric-brooding frog."
"And it would be a fair question to ask, why have we focused on these two animals?"
"Well, point number one, each of them represents a unique family of its own."
We've lost a whole family.
That's a big chunk of the global genome gone.
I'd like it back.
The second reason is that we killed these things.
"In the case of the thylacine, regrettably, we shot every one that we saw."
We slaughtered them.
"In the case of the gastric-brooding frog, we may have ""fungicided"" it to death."
"There's a dreadful fungus that's moving through the world that's called the chytrid fungus, and it's nailing frogs all over the world."
"We think that's probably what got this frog, and humans are spreading this fungus."
"And this introduces a very important ethical point, and I think you will have heard this many times when this topic comes up."
"What I think is important is that, if it's clear that we exterminated these species, then I think we not only have a moral obligation to see what we can do about it, but I think we've got a moral imperative to try to do something, if we can."
OK.
Let me talk to you about the Lazarus Project.
It's a frog.
"And you think, frog."
For example:
Negative two fifths X equals ten.
In this lesson you will learn to solve linear equations by using the multiplicative inverse.
Let's review.
The equation is similar to a scale.
Both sides of the scale have to be equal in order for the scale to balance.
The properties of equality say that
"I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide the same number  to each side of an equation and it will be true."
"So, to solve the equation X plus two is equal to five,"
I will subtract two from both sides of the equation.
This will still keep the equation equal.
This leaves me with X is equal to three.
"It looks like three is the solution for this equation, but we won't know if it's really a solution until we try it."
"So, let's replace three for X."
"So, in our equation we have X plus two equals five."
"When we replace three for X, we get three plus two equals five."
"Five is equal to five, so three is the solution."
A common mistake that is made when solving equations is not performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.
The multiplicative inverse of a number is the reciprocal of the number.
"So, if I have a number, seventeen-fifths, its inverse is the reciprocal, which would be five-seventeenths."
"When you multiply these two numbers together, you get one."
"So, the multiplicative inverse of the number, times the number, gives you one."
What is the solution of four-thirds X equals four?
"We're going to solve this equation by multiplying  both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of four thirds, which is three-fourths."
"Now, don't forget that three-fourths time four-thirds doesn't cancel out, but it multiplies out to be one."
"So, I'm left with X is equal to twelve over four, or X is equal to three."
"Now, remember, in order for it to be a solution we have to make sure that we place it back in the original equation and it's true."
"So, to check my answer:"
I have four-thirds X equals four.
I'm going to substitute three in for X.
And I get four is equal to four.
"So, three is the solution for this equation."
"What happened was not just people passed them on and surprising numbers viewed them, the tone of response we got back astonished us."
"People laughed, people cried, people were inspired, people tell their friends."
"This word again, passion."
"We saw the passion and that was a clue, that was something bigger here."
"So, we made a decision in 2007 that TED really officially was no longer a conference."
TED was going to be this.
[Slide reads:]
We engineered the web site to be built around spreading free talks to the world.
"And to our astonishment and delight, TED community far from being upset that we were giving away the crown jewels, shared this on, it was a thrilling to see."
"So, where is this going?"
"In 2009, we've seen the continuation of this process."
"Just letting TED go free to the world, we had this Open Translation Project, which has been thrilling seeing literally hundreds of translators take TED, bring those talks to their own communities."
"And, now, this TEDx program, spreading the live events to the world."
Where is it heading?
"Well, the truth is I don't know."
"I think it's an incredible fact, an incredible discovery really that millions of people around the world are wanting knowledge."
"You know, they want this re-discovery of wonder."
They want the sense of possibility.
And they actually want to be part of shaping the future.
That's a surprise and that's thrilling in its own right.
"But, even more thrilling is this."
"TED is part of much bigger revolution in, I'd say, global education that's made possible by the web."
"It's an amazing fact that people like this can become a new type of global icon, that the role of teacher in our world is about to become sexy, wonderful, you know, I mean,  and it should have always been, right?"
But that hasn't been for the last few years.
Teachers can reach people across the world.
That is amazing.
"And I... if you ask what my dream was, I think the way I would answer it, would be to look at this picture here."
These are kids photographed in the village in Pakistan not far from where I was born.
Their parents would have been born about the same time as me.
"Unlike me, I had an education and got to live an amazing life, they didn't have that chance."
They lived a life griding out a living in tough conditions.
"They're beautiful children,  may have a different chance."
It comes and goes.
"Like this many thing else, comes and goes."
"Like I was saying, just recently, you see the thoughts , they're random."
They're not sequential.
They're not really.. they're random.
"Like I was saying you were thinking, somehow meditating on just being self and then suddenly there is sort of like pizza or something come then after this sort of like 'aha, you know, go shopping in this place' and then 'ha, e-mail to somebody', you know, it's like just coming up like this."
But this kind of thought for you is more seasonal.
"It comes about, because there is something that is grown around this thought, that seems"
like it is intensely got some kind of nectar promise in it.
"But now, you're aware this now."
Because the fruit of this attachment or activity is that you're not happy about it.
You're not happy with it.
You're not happy with it.
Nobody is happy with it.
"Because you've the power to dream , but you don't have the power to make your dream come true."
Whatever we might think.
"If you've the power to decide what should appear in your life, Ok?"
"You're the architect and designer, everything that happens to you."
"Then, you , with that, all of you will be clear about who you're or something, if this is what you want."
Or you wouldn't include anything that is uncomfortable as an experience.
You will go all for chocolates flavored moments.
"So, something is, life takes that away from you."
You don't have this power.
"You may dream, but the purpose of life, is not to fulfill or to satisfy your projections."
"So, that is a wisdom in this and a maturity to learn to let go of that."
That these dreams they're depleting of your energy.
And brings in the state of confusion.
"So, what I'm pointing you to, is only the space of the awareness within which the story of , this kind of romance, and what this kind of images come and then another image come also, and it passes."
Something else comes.
Momentary attention passes.
"Innumerable thoughts , waves of , tsumani of thoughts come and they don't stick because you've no interest."
"But, some come and they stick."
Uh huh.
"And it doesn't look bad on the phone, we still, we still probably, we're still gonna add a um, MPS piece, and try to get involved, to be more responsive probably the next day."
"But uh, yeah the night that some of these people that were on our team that, that are really."
"You know the staff from the responsive design and the nine sixty, you know that Mh-hm And all those kinds of things, you know, we don't have a lot of information, I would think and a lot of information that is going to come and that kind of that and that would be really helpful What's the next, what's the direction of the website?"
"It'd be kind of nice if you guys had something about it, a little discussion could start, th e future of the web and things like that."
"Yeah, we are definitely focusing much more on that in the coming year."
"We want to do a lot more, we have a user experience fundamentals course coming out, content strategy."
"We're looking at doing usability testing, a lot more."
Fundamental information that will help as you approach your project.
"Whether it's a redesign or a new, a new site."
"And um, we've really focused on tools in the past."
How do I use Flash to do what I'm trying to do?
But I think that um.
"An area that we really want to look at is, now that you are in conjunction with tools, it's, it's just as important to understand why you are doing what you're doing."
"And to, to make the best decisions for your site and, and your membership, or your viewership."
"Right, mm-hm. , That is very interesting."
"And especially because the way, technology is being consumed, has so fundamentally changed, with mobile devices."
People are actually having these conversations now.
"You know, people are talking about responsive design, or they're talking about, uh, user experience."
"And it, it wasn't, much of a conversation a year ago."
"And, um, I think that people really, are."
"Are looking for this type of information, and it sounds like this would be beneficial for, for your project as well."
"Yea, particularly right now cuz I think that everybody I think is going to be redesigning their web right now."
Trying to get moving towards.
See the social media kind of stuff.
Right.
Yeah.
How do we integrate social media effectively.
How do we.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then we, and then we."
"So, watch out for that kind of thing, especially the multiple people have looked at the draft and edited the draft, references tend to get lost in the shuffle."
So here's an example of the first kind of thing I was talking about.
"So you, some authors give a reference to back up a statement."
You go to the original reference and it just doesn't back up the statement.
So here's an example.
"I'm going to pick on a particular example from something I was reading lately but again, These authors are by no means the only ones who do this."
"This is very, very common."
"So, I read the sentence."
These data are particularly disturbing as the UVC emission is even larger than ambient sunlight on a mountain.
"Now, I was writing about this for the lay public and so I thought, well great, here"
I've got a comparison that anybody can understand.
"The amount of UVC, if you're exposed to sunlight on a mountain."
"Well, that's a great way to put this in my piece."
So I wanted to get more information about this.
"I thought that was an interesting and cute fact, a good fact to use for a piece for the lay public."
"And I also had a question, because when they say it's larger than ambient sunlight on the mountain, they didn't give any time frame."
"So, is it larger than the amount that you'd get in one minute?"
Is it larger than the amount that you'd get in an hour?
So there was no reference right there.
So I needed to go back to the original references to get more information.
"And again, I, I'm doing this often for various reasons like, like we've been writing something for the lay public and I see an interesting statistic or fact that"
I wanna trace back.
Alright.
"So, to go to reference thirteen, Well, it's, it's you know, a URL."
"It's, it's a website link and it was broken."
"So, the, the link doesn't work."
"I get, you know, an error message."
It does bring me to a site.
So I search on that site and there's no relevant information about UVC emissions on a mountain on that site that I can find.
Maybe I didn't do a great search.
"So maybe, you know, the URL, link got broken, you know, between the time the authors wrotethe paper and, the time it was sent, it was published."
"Could have happened, But anyway, it's a problem because again,"
"Of course, we need it for ATP, we need it to build the phosphate sugar backbone of DNA, and we need it for energy transmission and so forth; all life needs it for that."
But it is really pretty scarce in the crust.
So it is usually limiting.
"Now if you just go out there and you pour a bunch of phosphate into the landscape, this is what you get."
Okay?
"You get lakes filled with algal blooms, and that is showing you the dramatic response of-- the algal population and plant population in lakes is showing you that phosphorous really is the limiting factor."
"So phosphate fertilizer is very important in agro-ecosystems, and phosphate fertilizer gets washed into lakes and fish die."
Why do fish die in an eutrophic lake that has a lot of algae in it?
What's killing them?
Yes?
Student:
"Because when the algae becomes decomposed, those &amp;gt; will take a lot of it and change it into nitrogen. &amp;gt;"
Prof:
"Well you've got it right about anoxia, but you got the mechanism wrong."
"By the way, the bottom of a eutrophic lake is anoxic and the process you described is going on there."
But the algae don't have to die to do that.
Student: &amp;gt;
Prof:
Well the algae certainly are taking the sunlight out of the top of the water.
But when does the oxygen disappear from the lake?
"I remember the bad joke about the astronaut who was not so bright, who said, ""Ah, we are going to take our new spacecraft and we are going to"
"land on the sun."""
"And he was asked, ""How are you ever going to"
"land on the sun?"""
"And he said, ""Don't worry, we are going at night."""
It happens at night.
At night the algae are all there.
"They're not making oxygen because there's no photons coming in, but they still have to breathe themselves, and they just suck all the oxygen out of the water and the fish are asphyxiated."
They don't have to die to do it.
They're just naturally living their lives as normal healthy algae and they suck the oxygen out of the water at night.
"Okay, so some take-home points on ecosystems."
"Movement of matter and energy around the planet is really important, and there are some really interesting large-scale issues."
You might not know it at the time but I call them growing pains.
"Your heart is growing when it's crying, when it's hurt"
"- it's part of things, so allow it to be."
"Be with it and you'll find out why it was there for you, what it's teaching was."
When somebody dies it tells you the value of life.
When you break up with someone you love it tells you how valuable relationships are.
When you get disappointed it tells you just how your expectations were far far too unreal.
"When somebody dies, it shows that your time here is not that long, so I must make better use of it."
"All of these so-called negative experiences they're all teachers, so we should never reject them."
Allow them to come intro our heart.
Make good kamma with the bad kamma you're experiencing now.
That way we grow and those positive emotions become stronger and stronger inside of us.
"We become beacons to the world, people who don't get afraid, don't get angry, who don't have grief."
"But have lots of kindness, lots of joy, huge amounts of peace."
Positive emotions grow at the expense of the negative ones.
They grow and grow and grow.
This is actually the path.
What a wonderful thing it is to cherish and nurture these beautiful positive emotions of life.
"Understand where they come from, nurture them, grow them, the negative ones become less and less a part of your repertoire."
"You don't get angry, you get very kind."
"You don't get depressed, you just get wonderfully inspired."
"You don't get so fault-finding, you'd be grateful in the smallest of things, even in..."
"I shouldn't say that, I was going to say a small John Howard."
The smallest of things.. [laughter].
"I shouldn't give him a hard time, he's not a bad guy."
And that way we can have a happier
"life and we can understand the role of emotions in life, how to deal with them, how embrace them, how to generate the positive ones and have a happy time."
"So may you all have a happy time by developing the positive emotions, understanding the negative ones, and understanding how this all works."
"So that's the talk for this evening, thank you very much for listening."

Ajahn Brahm:
"A high school reunion brings some 50 former students to Riceville, Iowa."
"Eleven of them--some with their spouses and children--arrive early for a special reunion with their former third-grade teacher, Jane Elliott."
This presentation is delivered by the Stanford Center for Professional
Development.
Hey there!
"Oh, we're back."
We're back and now we're getting down and dirty.
"We'll do more pointers, and link"
"list, and implementations."
It's actually going to be like our life for the next week and half.
"There's just even more implementation, trying to think about how those things work on the backside."
So
I will do another alternate implementation of the stack today.
So we did one based on vector and we're going to do one based on a link list.
"And then I'm going to do a cube based on link list, as well, to kind of just mix and match a little bit."
"And then, we're still at the end of the case study, which the material is covered in Chapter 9."
I probably won't get thorough all of that today.
"What we don't finish today we'll be talking about on Friday, and then we'll go on to start talking about map implementation and look at binary search trees."
How many people started [inaudible]?
How many of you got somewhere feeling good?
Not just yet.
"One thing I will tell you is that there are two implementations you're working on and I listed them in the order of the one that the material we've seen the most, right."
We've talked about link list more than we have talked about things that are tree and heat based.
So I listed that one first.
"But, in fact, actually, in terms of difficulty of coding,"
"I think, the second one is little bit more attractable than the first."
So there's no reason you can't do them in either order if it feels good to you to start on the second one before you come back to the first one.
"Or just trade off between working on them if one of them is giving you fits just look at the other one to clear your head, so just a thought about how to approach it."
Okay.
So I am going to do some coding.
I'm going to come back to my slides in a little bit here.
Anyone interested?
Couple of you?
Yeah.
"So, Greywater, it's from sinks, showers and washing machines."
So its water that's a little bit dirty but it's not too dirty to other plants.
"It's never from toilets and it's not from washing diapers, so it doesn't have thicker matter in it."
"It's not like the toilets, which would be not safe to reuse."
"Kitchen sinks, it depends on what state you"
live in if it's considered Greywater or not.
"In California, kitchen sinks are not allowed to be--we're not allowed to reuse that water legally."
So I want to break Greywater into three ways.
The first one is for outdoor use.
"This is just taking the Greywater, sending it outside."
"You're taking a shower, it's going out just directly and irrigating your plants."
So that's the simplest way to use it.
It's low tech.
We try not to have pumps or filters or things that require maintenance and mechanical devices.
"The second way is also for outdoor use, but this is a little different."
"It's taking Greywater and sending it through a drip irrigation system, which is a lot more complicated because Greywater has hair in it, has lint, it has little, you know, chunks of things."
It's a little gunky.
"And so, if you want to send that to drip irrigation, you're going have to really filter it and get all the particles out."
"And so, then you just have a much more complex system."
So it's a really different way to use the water.
And then the third way is indoor use.
"And so that's for non-potable uses, such as toilet flushing, and possibly laundry washing."
And it's also a lot more complicated to get greywater back inside because it has to be filtered and disinfected and it's pumped and it's connected to the domestic water supply.
And it's really just a whole other level of system.
It's also not really allowed under the new code in any practical way and so it's definitely a good resource for bigger scale projects like commercial buildings.
"For residential, it's usually not very appropriate."
"And so, when you're thinking about any type of Greywater System, the soaps and the products you use really matter because now that water is going to your plants."
So there's a couple of things you want to avoid.
You want to avoid any salt compound.
A lapse can lead to a relapse ... but it doesn't have to.
Use what you learned from your slip-up to fine-tune your quit plan and commit again to being smoke-free.
"Remember why you quit, and keep on quitting."

WARREN:
"Hi, I'm Charles Warren."
I'm a User Experience Designer on mobile and welcome.
Thanks for coming.
"I want to introduce Laura Allen, who for many years has been a champion of Greywater out of Oakland."
She was the founder of Greywater Guerillas.
"You may be aware that it used to not be strictly legal to use Greywater for irrigations, so she led a lot of the work to cut those policy changes and things done."
We're very happy to have her.
And Greg Bullock is a contractor and installer who build these systems.
He's going to talk about some of the ways you can go about and thinking through whether a Greywater system makes sense for you.
And I think they've got us--they're going to lay down the gauntlet for us Googlers.
"So, without further ado, take it away Laura and Greg and thank you so much for being here. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Thanks for having me.
I'm Laura.
"I'm a co-founder of Greywater Guerilla's, now known as Greywater Action."
"Before we start talking about Greywater, I want to think about--first thing, think about water for a sec."
So I have a couple of cups of water over here and I want you to--so the first one represents a country.
It's totally full; it's got 156 gallons of water in it.
"Anyone want to guess what country what might use this amount per day, as per capita use? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; The U.S.? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:"
"Yeah, the United States."
"This other cup, this represents a continent now and this is representing about 88 gallons per person per day."
"So it's just residential use: cooking, drinking, watering their landscape, not agriculture, not industry."
Anyone want to guess what continent might use this much? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Europe. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
Yep.
Europe.
The main factor determining your success will be your marketing skills.
Will the Liftago service work from day one of the launch?
"Yes, indeed."
Our Liftago Team will take care of that.
What we expect from you - the marketers - is to help us spread our business across the globe.
No passenger can order a taxi without taxi drivers using our app.
"And likewise, no Liftago driver can receive an order without passengers."
That's why we share half of our taxi ride revenue with you.
"You are the only ones with enough power, resources, and motivation to share the apps with drivers and passengers."
What is the key to success?
"Support your community, talk to taxi drivers and passengers, and share your experience and knowledge."
Create a group of skilled taxi drivers who will join your community and attract many new Liftago passengers every day.
And now I'd like to ask Ondrej from our Liftago team to show you our app.
"Hello, let's have a look at what our apps will look like."
We've been developing two of them: the Liftago Taxi app for passengers and the Liftago Driver app for drivers.
Both of them are compatible with iPhone and Android devices.
All versions will be availabe in local languages upon launching.
Let's take a look at the ordering process from the passenger's point of view.
"Now imagine that I'm a potential passenger sitting in a café, finishing my coffee and waiting for the bill."
I'm launching the Liftago Taxi app and I immediately see there are 3 available taxis around.
I click on the taxi icon and the app gets me the best taxi according to my preset preferences.
"But since I know where I'm going, I'd rather insert my destination address."
I switch to the list of taxi drivers and I can see that there is one I have hired before and whom I was happy with.
I can see the fare and I take a look at the rough estimate for the total price of the ride.
"It's acceptable for me, so I place an order."
"Now I'm waiting for the driver to confirm the order, which he does quickly!"
I can see he's just around the corner.
Now I'm just waiting for him to tell me he's here.
"I can see him on the map, and in the meantime, I pay my bill."
He's arrived!
I'm leaving the restaurant and my taxi is waiting outside.
The driver greets me and has indicated I'm on board.
It's beautiful from every standpoint if you're a health economist.
You keep healthcare cost down and you get revenue and wages up.
"Now, some."
"Nasty, bleeding heart liberals say, you're taxing people."
True but their wages are also going up so their take home pay guess what?
It's going up.
You don't collect taxes unless their wages are going up.
It's a beautiful thing to tax people more.
"It means that earning more, okay?"
"This is the law stand point, those of us who are being inclined to the economic way of thinking, this is a beautiful thing."
"So, you're right."
You take.
All three existing condition but there is still another problem which is age.
What do we know about age?
"You guys are healthy, I'm getting sick, right."
I'm getting older and the older you are the more likely you are to get sick.
Your body just runs down.
"Things begin to fall apart, you need replacement parts, right?"
"So, the [inaudible] was more likely to hit more people except there is protection, alright."
One protection is.
"In cases each year index with inflation, okay?"
"We have a higher threat of level for the entire individuals, 55 and older, high risk professions, [inaudible] objective, firefighter, excellent."
"Unions and high risks so, you know, this is democracy."
You cater to every special interest.
You decide this [inaudible] arrangements with all sorts of exceptions and [inaudible] because you want to keep the center.
Companies with higher health cost stood to age or gender or their work.
Get exceptions.
"So, we've tried to take into account many of these potential problems."
"And by the way, in the exchange, there's a limit to how much you can [inaudible] because of older people, three to one ratio."
"The, the funny raise a point here."
"Notice this, what's beautiful about that first doc?"
It's inflation adjusted but why is that such a beautiful [inaudible] health care economist like prices.
The limit as delta t approaches 0 of r of s t plus delta t minus r of s and t.
"In this situation we're holding the s, you can imagine, in constant."
"We're finding its change in t, all of that over delta t."
And the same thing falls out.
"This is equal to the partial of x with respect to ti plus y with respect to tj, plus z with respect to tk."
"Same exact thing, you just kind of swap the s's and the t's."
"And by that same logic, you'd have the same result but in terms of t."
"If you do this pseudo mathy thing that I did up here, then you would get the partial of r with respect to t times a super small change in t. dt, our t differential, you could imagine, is equal to r of st plus dt minus r of s and t."
So let's box these two guys away.
"And in the next video, we're going to actually visualize what these mean."
"And sometimes, when you kind of do a bunch of like, silly math"
"like this, you're always like, all right, what is this all about?"
"Remember, all I did is I said, what does it mean to take the derivative of this with respect to s or t?"
"Played around with it a little bit, I got this result."
"These 2 are going to be very valuable for us, I think, in getting the intuition for why surface integrals"
look the way they do.
"So in problem 44, once again we have the exact same setup that we had in problems 42 and 43."
But now they're asking us the number of A in T sub p such that the determinant of A is not divisible by p.
"Well, we've already done some work in problem 43 in figuring out some set of the members that are divisible by p."
"So why don't we just figure out the total number of members of T sub p, and then subtract the total members whose determinants are divisible by p, and then we'll get this answer right over here."
So what's the total members in T sub p?
"Well, for a, I have p possible choices, right?"
"If I'm picking between-- up to p minus 1, but I'm including 0, there's actually p possible choices."
"So I have p possible choices for a, p possible choices for b by the same logic, and p possible choices for c."
So I have p to the third possibilities.
So there are a total of p to the third members in T sub p.
"Now, what did the last problem tell us?"
This was number 43.
It told us the members-- maybe I should write it this way.
"The number of members, numbers of A's, such that the trace of A-- this was the language I used in the last video or the last problem-- such that the trace of A not divisible by p, but the determinant of A is."
And we got the answer as p minus 1 squared.
"It's a strong contingency to natural chemicals, more toxic chemicals are natural chemicals."
Which mother would give cancer to her child?
"When we are romanticizing nature, we are putting us down, because the mother is good, so the child is bad."
"So, there is no ""Mother Earth""."
"We can learn from nature; it's a partnership, it's learning, it's being proud of our own qualities as well."
Our natural lifetime expectancy is 30 years.
"When we get older, it's our creativity, it's our civilization, it's our science, it's our industry, it's our medicine."
"So, we don't need to talk about ""Mother Earth""."
"A mother would not have a girl losing her leg, just by biting."
No.
"So, there is no reason to romanticize nature, because when we romanticize nature, we always feel guilty."
"And out of guilt, we are not creative,"
"Out of guilt, you cannot develop new things."
"So, it's about becoming native to this planet."
Why do we delegate being native to the Yanomamis?
We are the native people of this planet.
Why do we delegate being in harmony with nature to Aborigines?
We are the aborigines of the planet.
We are the natives of this planet.
"If we don't learn to become natives to this planet, then, we will destroy each other."
"For example, we talk about overpopulation, you could see the curve of overpopulation."
The weight of ants; it's about to four times more than of all human beings.
"And because ants don't make waste; because ants live only three to six months, because ants never take elevators, they are equal to 30 billion people in their calories consumption."
"So, we are not too many, we are just stupid, we make waste."
"Even when we think about ""zero waste"", we think about waste."
"It's the same thing, when I tells you, ""Don't think about the pink crocodile!"""
We think about the pink crocodile.
But nature doesn't think about waste.
Nature only makes stuff for biological cycles.
So we can learn from nature.
But we do not just live.
"We like washing machines, we like computers."
For the most part we have acting out kids altogether.
"But, he, academically he does very, very well when he wants to do it."
"I don't know, some days I can go into school, sit down, not say a word, do everything."
"And everyone will say, wish we could have Adam like this all day without his hat on, without him talking, doing all his work, asking for more work."
And other days it's like Adam comes in and starts goofing off.
So real high school turned out to be another missed opportunity.
He's a fragile guy right now.
"You know, I want him to be successful."
"But when you don't give a student what they need, the potential for really falling apart and giving up is so high that you really have to factor that in."
It's a possibility.
A year later the school has expelled Adam for poor behavior.
"Once again, adrift,"
Adam has held a variety of odd jobs.
And his mother fears he is back on drugs and alcohol.
"When I was a little kid I dreamed of going to college, going to school."
But I haven't finished high school so I can't go to college.
Now I have no high school diploma so I just work full time.
It's like what else do I have?
Nothing.
I see kids every single day that are like Adam.
And sometimes I can get to them.
And sometimes I can help them.
And sometimes they slip by.
But there's no reason that Adam needed to slip by.
We had Adam.
We had a hold on Adam.
"What Adam needed, the experts say, was the hardest thing to get, early recognition of his problems and a consistent plan for dealing with them."
In some states the size of prisons are predicted on the basis of third grade and fourth grade literacy rates.
"So it does portend an alienation from society, in a sense."
"And it's for those reasons, these downstream consequences of loss of self esteem, poor academic development, limited vocabulary and other cognitive developments, difficulties with social relations, difficulties getting and holding jobs, and getting in trouble with the law that we consider reading problems to not only to be an educational issue but a public health issue and a public health concern as well."
Now Adam's parents are left with what they had at the very beginning but only that they still have hope.
You change your dreams.
Is there indifference or is there passion?
Passion is the measure of a media business that has valued for the long term.
"You can get away with selling ads for a while for example to large numbers of casual people, but they pretty well will knew, passion is how you build a community, how something takes on a life of its own."
"And, what I saw at TED was not only what the 800 people there -- you know, really influential people!"
But they had a level of attention that was way off the charts.
"I mean, they were there for 4 days."
They were focused.
They were engaged.
They used words like  'this is the highlight of my year'.
"I mean, this was a media thing that just exhibited extraordinary passion."
"So, I thought"
TED is amazing.
"And I also thought, Wow, it's an incredibly potent media asset, if you like, in the making."
"There's something really, really amazing here."
"So, I started to dream about whether there might be some way I could play a bigger role."
"And you know, to cut a long and complicated and occasionally painful story short, 2001, a foundation that I had set up found itself as the proud owner of TED and I got to run it, and I was terrified."
"First of all, business I'd been building had been smacked hard by the dot-com bust."
I'd had to lay off a thousand people off the workforce.
I knew that it was time for me too to leave.
I felt like an abject failure.
"If I failed at TED as well, there would be nowhere to hide."
It also didn't help that I knew nothing about the conference business.
(Laughter)
"Or, that I had none of Richard Wurman -- who had been the sole owner --"
I had nothing of his huge stage presence.
"So, the goal number one was ""Don't screw it up."""
(Laughter)
"And, I worked really hard to figure out, what was it about TED so special?"
"""Don't touch that."
"Only tweaks."""
"Some of the early tweaks included professionalizing the logistics of TED, courtesy of these two amazing Canadian twins, the McCartney sisters, who put on events with attention to detail that I hadn't seen before."
"And then as far as the program was concerned, it was just continue this process, make it -- continue the process of broadening it out, you know, bring in more people, brought in more scientists, more out-of-the-box thinkers, more non-Americans, more women."
They have a form of language.
[high pitched ape sound by man.]
And they use more complex tools than anyone realized.
"By looking at the differences and similarities between apes and us, we may find the secret ingredient that makes apes apes and humans human."
We take it for granted but self-recognition is a fundamental building block of human society.
We exist as individuals.
Each with our own unique features.
Scientists believe self-recognition is essential for our survival.
We can live in large groups because we recognize similar features to our own in others.
We can tell friend from foe.
But is self-recognition uniquely human?
Show a monkey a mirror and it thinks it's another monkey - it attacks.
But how will our closer relatives the great apes react when faced with their own image?
This 3 year old chimpanzee has never seen a mirror before.
He's not sure what to make of it.
Erect fur is usually a sign of fear or anger.
But his fear is soon replaced by curiosity.
"When chimps see themselves in mirrors the first time, they naturally assume it's another chimp."
The way a human being who's never seen themselves before does.
And begin to play with mirror image.
"Soon, this chimp will know it is looking at itself."
"Just like these older chimps, they know exactly what mirrors do."
This chimp appears to know that that's her tongue and those are her teeth.
Chimpanzees seem to have a concept of the bodily self that allows them to look into a mirror and say that image is equivalent to this body.
But how can we prove that humans and chimpanzees really identify the figure in the mirror as themselves.
Psychologists have a well-known test for this.
"It's called the ""mark test."""
A researcher marks a child's cheek.
The child then looks in the mirror.
He moves his hand up to the mark.
He recognizes himself.
"By the age of 2, half of all children tested can recognize themselves."
"All I was doing was paying off the interest on the debt I had, which was £30,000."
"I was basically rocking around the clock, really."
My standard of living wasn't good at all.
I didn't go out and the amount of money that I had for food was £40 for the month.
I came to a time when I thought enough was enough and at the time I was working in a hospital.
I started going to the chapel there and that's where I then found a book called 'Word for Today'.
I read that book and at the back of it it had a salvation prayer.
I read that salvation prayer and I gave my life to God.
I put my heart and soul in a letter and I sent it off to the address that was at the back of that book.
I got a phone call from somebody called Pastor Sheila.
She invited me to the church and she counselled me and I told her about my debt problems and she gave me some information for Christians Against Poverty.
"At that stage I was so relieved because of the fact that I knew then that I would get support, and the burden just lifted."
"Any letters, any correspondance that I had with my creditors,"
"I just directed them to Christians Against Poverty, which was a relief, basically; it just took away the stress."
"As a consequence to becoming a CAP client, I also now support people who are also in debt."
"I've learned how to budget, my standard of living has improved because I'm able to go out and socialise, which I couldn't do before."
The fellowship with the people at church is crucial as well because they also offered support.
"When you are going through debt you sort of withdraw and you don't socialise because of the lack of money, but once the stress has been taken away you're able to talk about it and testify about how good God is and how stressless you are."
"The home stretch, we're on problem 18."
And this diagram actually looks like something that this little tool I'm using is well-suited to draw.
"Let me try-- I'll draw the one in the back first, so I can do different colors and everything."
"So I'll do the one in the back in yellow, and it looks something like this."
"Goes like this, then it switches over like that."
"And then I'll draw the next one, this orange color, and it looks something-- no, I'll do it in a more drastic color."
So it does something like this.
"It goes like this, crosses over, dips down, then it goes over again."
"And then finally, this last one, and it looks something like this."
"Crosses over and it goes like that, very pretty."
Now let me switch to a smaller-- OK.
"Why don't we do white, I never write in white."
In the figure above--so they say this is the start.
And this is step 1.
But it's done over that theme of blow the man down which is about violence and the threat of squalls and storms at sea.
"And the fact that, that carries from the deck onto the drawing of the line on the map."
Where that X is placed.
"Is a, is a very strong sense of, of foreboding."
"Something will go wrong, and then it brings us to the ship at night."
Now this scene is a straightforward exhibition scene.
It's interesting because the guy serving coffee seems to be really angry at the world.
But watch what happens after it's done.
Back to the ship at night.
"Now interesting, we don't need any voice over, all we need is the face of Finn, the sound of the wind, and the mysterium theme to come back to give us this feeling that something is a mess that all is not happy and easy on the surface, and that there are very, very deep and wrong things going on."
"And this is the, the secret of alludent film, that the atmosphere is always there undercutting even the easy placid moments."
You can never get rid of the monsters.
The monster or the monsteress.
"Now the sinister texture of sound all pays off in the climax of the film, which is quite troubling and disturbing, but beautifully, beautifully done."
"Now, the climax begins with something that we might expect, an orchestral score showing Stone's madness."
[music]
"And his voice over, we're finally getting subjective access to his character's psychology and now we all know this man is completely cracked."
"It's going to climax when he's going to go back to that sign that we saw in the very first scene where he met his junior officer and no longer can face this, we see the madness in the strictness of his authority here."
[music]
"Right, now that's the climax of the score for the moment."
It's going to drift down now.
And as he pulls that sabre off of his wall.
We've been wondering what would happen to that.
We cut away a little bit of exposition as the good guys.
We guess they're good guys.
They don't anything in the end.
They're wondering about the telegram and get this.
[music]
"Billy Radd, again starting his calypso."
[music]
"And it was quite a jaunty, happy number as we see."
[music]
"The onus is on you to educate me deeply about this thing that I'm not even interested in."" There's no way to overcome that kind of requirement, nobody can win that argument."
But it turns out that usually that reasoning is wrong.
I've heard that argument about why we shouldn't have to worry about closure.
I've heard it about why we shouldn't use recursion.
I've heard it about why punch cards are better than timesharing.
"You can go all the way back to 'it's better for us to be programming with digits, I don't understand why we need compilers'."
It's been going on from the beginning.
"That's why software development is so slow, because basically we have to wait for a generation to die off before we can get critical mass on the next good idea."
[laughter]
This is Grace again.
See the 'courtesy' badge?
I had to pay $200 to get the rights to use this picture.
"It was actually $100 but I wanted lifetime rights, so I can use it from now on."
"I'm going to use it a lot, anytime I can."
[laughter]
"I've used it twice tonight, so that's $100 per view."
"I'm getting it down, I'm getting it down."
"We've gone a long way since Grace created the discipline of software engineering, but we still have a very long way to go."
I think we're not as far along as we should be at this point.
"I think we're mainly not farther along because of that 'waa, I don't want to have to learn anything' problem."
"You are not those guys, and that's why you're here tonight to hear me rant about this."
"I appreciate that, and I think that shows a lot of value for you."
"The big surprise for me in this is we're about to take maybe the most important step we've ever taken in terms of the technology of the web, and JavaScript is leading the way."
Who would ever have imagined that?
"JavaScript is now being the technology leader, it's not just the thing that we tolerate."
Wow.
"But there we are, that's where we're going."
"Goodnight Grace, wherever you are."
"And goodnight, thank you very much."
[applause]
"I don't see very much now, I used to go quite often to see dance, and theatre shows and cinema and so on"
"I've got two small children now so I don't go and see very much but what we have seen in the last few years has really been around stuff for children that they'll enjoy free, open air things, maybe at the Southbank or something or theatre shows that are for children."
Dooby-doooby-doo Doo-doo-doo-di-da
"Hey there, it's Kati again."
Thanks for coming back to check out my videos.
"Today I'd like to talk about a tip, that I give to all of my client's I even have to give it to myself repeatedly to remind myself about this."
"And this has to do with people suffering from anxiety, stress, depression."
"You name it, this is something that we should all constantly evaluate in our lives."
"And that is, not spending time with people who are bad for us."
Okay well that sounds really easy.
People who we hate probably don't hang out with.
People who are really mean to us we probably don't hang out with.
"But if you really think about it, there are probably people in your life, that I call ""toxic"" friends."
Especially when we're talking about eating disorder people.
"We go into inpatient, we're there with maybe six to ten other girls, some of which want to get better, like you, working hard to pull through, and it's really difficult, and they're there to help support you."
"Those are great friends to have around and that's what I'm hoping to cultivate in this website, is a big support system of people rooting for us, right, to do better not to do worse."
"But there's always a few people in those treatment programs, who kind of make a life of being in treatment."
"They don't really want to get better, and they kind of pull the rest of us down."
"They even put up websites and things to help ""promote"" anorexia and"
"""promote"" sickness."
Why would you do that?
These are people that can hinder you're recovery.
"And I know it's hard to let people go, and I'm not saying that you have to tell your friends, or call them up and say,"
"""hey you know what?"
"I was watching this video and I'm not friends with you anymore. 'click'."""
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying limit your interaction with people like this.
"Because I guarantee, if you evaluate it after."
"Like, Let's say you go have coffee with this friend who is ""toxic""."
"Afterwards, you probably feel worse about yourself, you're probably counting calories, more than you normally do, you skipped a snack,"
"""not on purpose"", but kind of on purpose, because they're in your head."
"They're making bad comments about you, about themselves, about what's going on."
And those people just aren't healthy.
"So that's my tip that I give to everybody, whose suffering from anything."
"Your life would be better if you could work a little less, if you didn't have to work so hard, if you could get home a little earlier, if you could retire a little faster, if you could punch out a little sooner -- it's all in there, over and over, again and again."
Washington?
I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place that affect the bottom line reality of the available jobs because I don't really know.
I just know that that's a front in this war.
"And right here guys, Silicon Valley,"
I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?
How many people have their Blackberries?
We're plugged in; we're connected.
I would never suggest for a second that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.
"Good grief, not to this crowd."
(Laughter)
But I would suggest that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.
"And nobody celebrates imitation the way ""Dirty Jobs"" guys know it has to be done."
"Your iPhone without those people making the same interface, the same circuitry, the same board, over and over?"
All of that?
That's what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it.
"So, we've got this new toolbox, you know."
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.
They look like the stuff we walk around with.
And so the collective effect of all of that has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.
"And I realized, probably too late in this game --"
"I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things -- but we're going to do as many as we can."
"And to me the most important thing to know and to really come face to face with, is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things, not just the testicles on my chin."
I got a lot wrong.
"So, we're thinking -- by we, I mean me -- that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work, manual labor, skilled labor."
Somebody needs to be out there talking about the forgotten benefits.
"I'm talking about grandfather stuff, the stuff a lot us probably grew up with but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little."
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.
The infrastructure is a huge deal.
"This war on work, that I suppose exists, has casualties"
like any other war.
The infrastructure's the first one; declining trade-school enrollments are the second one.
The fact that scientists quantitative is a huge theme in the course.
We'll be focusing on operational definitions in the next couple of weeks.
You'll get to practice that later on in the course.
And organize skepticism is another big thing.
This'll really be a focus in week three.
But we'll start thinking about it now.
Welcome back.
We were in the midst of figuring out the Laplace transform of sine of at when I was running out of time.
This was the definition of the Laplace transform of sine of at.
I said that also equals y.
"This is going to be useful for us, since we're going to be doing integration by parts twice."
"So I did integration by parts once, then I did integration by parts twice."
"I said, you know, don't worry about the boundaries of the integral right now."
Let's just worry about the indefinite integral.
And then after we solve for y-- let's just say y is the indefinite version of this-- then we can evaluate the boundaries.
"And we got to this point, and we made the realization, after doing two integration by parts and being very careful not to hopefully make any careless mistakes, we realized, wow, this is our original y."
"If I put the boundaries here, that's the same thing as the"
"Laplace transform of sine of at, right?"
That's our original y.
"So now-- and I'll switch colors just avoid monotony-- this is equal to, actually, let me just-- this is y."
Right?
That was our original definition.
So let's add a squared over sine squared y to both sides of this.
"So this is equal to y plus-- I'm just adding this whole term to both sides of this equation-- plus a squared over s squared y is equal to-- so this term is now gone, so it's equal to this stuff."
And let's see if we can simplify this.
So let's factor out an e to the minus st.
"Actually, let's factor out a negative e to the minus st."
"So it's minus e to the minus st, times sine of-- well, let me just write 1 over s, sine of at, minus 1 over s squared, cosine of at."
I really hope I haven't made any careless mistakes.
"And so this, we can add the coefficient."
"So we get 1 plus a squared, over s squared, times y."
But that's cheating.
And it hurts your throat.
"So there's things you can't do, and these limitations on the human voice have always really annoyed me, because beatbox is the best way of getting musical ideas out of your head and into the world, but they're sketches at best, which is what's annoyed me."
"If only, if only there was a way for these ideas to come out unimpeded by the restrictions which my body gives it."
"So I've been working with these guys, and we've made a machine."
"We've made a system which is basically a live production machine, a real-time music production machine, and it enables me to, using nothing but my voice, create music in real time as I hear it in my head unimpeded by any physical restrictions that my body might place on me."
And I'm going to show you what it can do.
"And before I start making noises with it, and using it to manipulate my voice,"
I want to reiterate that everything that you're about to hear is being made by my voice.
"This system has -- thank you, beautiful assistant -- this system has no sounds in it itself until I start putting sounds in it, so there's no prerecorded samples of any kind."
"So once this thing really gets going, and it really starts to mangle the audio I'm putting into it, it becomes not obvious that it is the human voice, but it is, so I'm going to take you through it bit by bit and start nice and simple."
So the polyphony problem:
I've only got one voice.
How do I get around the problem of really wanting to have as many different voices going on at the same time.
The simplest way to do it is something like this.
(Beatboxing)
By dancing.
It's like this.
(Music)
Thanks.
(Applause)
So that's probably the easiest way.
"But if you want to do something a little bit more immediate, something that you can't achieve with live looping, there's other ways to layer your voice up."
"There's things like pitch-shifting, which are awesome, and I'm going to show you now what that sounds like."
"So I'm going to start another beat for you, like this."
(Beatboxing)
"There's always got to be a bit of a dance at the start, because it's just fun, so you can clap along if you want."
You don't have to.
It's fine.
Check it out.
I'm going to lay down a bass sound now.
(Music)
"Now, of course, over time we worked harder and had more machines, so overall output in US economy grew much faster than 2.4% a year."
It grew more like 7-10% a year over that period.
"Yet, the point is that a lot of that we can get for free, essentially, without any harder work or any more capital."
"However, starting in 1973 until the early 1990s, productivity growth fell dramatically to 1% per year."
That is literally we lost 1 1/2% per year of stuff we were getting before.
"We were getting 2 1/2% a year up to '73, all of a sudden it's down to 1%."
That's 1 1/2% a year less stuff we can get unless we work harder to make up for it.
Why did this happen?
"Well, we don't exactly know, but there's two good candidates."
"We know the two candidates, we just don't know the right proportions."
One is that we have less capital in our society because savings fell.
The amount of savings US households do fell dramatically.
And the US has a very low savings rate.
The US savings rate over this period averaged about 3%.
"That is, every dollar we earned we saved about 3% as a society."
"Compared to countries like Japan, where it's more like 20%."
Every dollar they earn they save about 20%.
Now why does that matter?
"Well, we'll talk about this later in the course, but essentially the amount we save determines the amount of capital we have in society."
"Because essentially, where do firms get the money to build machines?"
They get it by borrowing from households who save.
And the
"less we save, the less money there is that firms could invest in building machines."
And we'll talk about that at length later in the semester.
"But the bottom line is, the more we save as a country, the more money we have available, the more firms can take that money and build machines that improve our standard of living."
"And that saving fell a lot, and that's one reason."
And the other reason is that productivity fell for reasons we don't quite understand.
"We know that productivity slowed down, but we don't quite understand why that is."
"But then in the 1990s, productivity shot up again."
"So productivity went back up towards our historic levels, from 1% back up to over 2% a year."
Why is that?
"Well, it's unclear, but we think it's basically the IT revolution."
So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.
And here you can see the body actor.
"And then this is what we called the ""dead head,"" no reference to Jerry Garcia."
And then here's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance.
"And then, again, the final shot."
It was a long process.
(Applause)
"The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this, because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides."
We had to create a lighting system.
"So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that Benjamin had to appear so that we could put Ben's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors in the real world."
We also had to create an eye system.
"We found the old adage, you know,"
"""The eyes are the window to the soul,"" absolutely true."
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
"And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity, and feel his intent coming through the eyes, then we would succeed."
So we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years.
We also had to create a mouth system.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had to age the teeth over time.
We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He was very popular.
Skin displacement: another big deal.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
"He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home around other old people, so he had to look exactly the same as the others."
"So, lots of work on skin deformation, you can see in some of these cases it works, in some cases it looks bad."
"This is a very, very, very early test in our process."
"So, effectively we created a digital puppet that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face."
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance.
"There was something that we encountered, though, that we ended up calling ""the digital Botox effect."""
"So, as things went through this process,"
Strong force.
All right.
"The weak and the strong forces here, these are intranuclear forces within the nucleus."
That's what keeps the protons and neutrons and the quarks together.
"For the most part, the weak and the strong force don't have an effect in chemistry, with the exception for beta decay, for some radioactive elements."
"That's where you need to think about, in particular, the weak force."
"Gravity also -- Well, gravity actually has no known consequence for chemistry."
"It doesn't mean that there isn't one, but it has no known consequence for chemistry."
"All of chemistry is tied up in this force, the electromagnetic force."
"Now, what I am going to do is I am going to simplify it just a little bit and just call this the Coulomb force."
And why I am going to do that is going to be a little more obvious when you get to 8.02.
But I am going to call it the Coulomb interaction.
And we know what the Coulomb force law looks like.
The Coulomb force law is the following.
"Say I have a positive charge, which is my nucleus."
I am going to call that force plus e.
"And at some distance R, R is the distance now, between that nucleus and the negatively charged particle, which is my electron."
I can describe the force of attraction between this electron in the nucleus by the following expression.
"That force, which is a function of the distance between the two charges, is just the magnitude of the charge on the negatively charged particle times the magnitude on the positively charged particle over 4 pi epsilon nought r squared."
"Now, I am going to treat this force, just for simplicity purposes right now, as a scalar."
"I am not going to talk about the direction, but because this is a force between a positive and negative charge, this is an attractive force."
This epsilon down here is the permittivity of the vacuum.
It is in there for doing our unit conversion correctly.
That is all I will say about it.
Maybe you will talk a little bit more about it in 8.02.
"And then, finally, here is the r squared."
That is the important part.
That is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.
And what I want you to notice here-- I don't need the screen down yet.
Hello.
She just switched it?
"Oh, all right."
People fixed this with something called Time Division Multiplexing and there are
"lots of different algorithms for how to do this but the idea is that the computer is so fast it can jump, it can spend some time on one thread, jump to the second, jump to the third, and then come back to the fourth and as the user we don't see the difference."
"That said, eh, yeah."
And this multithreading has been around for decades too because we can do this.
"Okay, so there are some issues with using parallel programing."
In parallel programing when you write parallel programing you run into a lot more troubles than just writing serial code.
What kinds of troubles?
"Well first thing, you have to think how to divide the problem up so that you can run it in parallel because some, some problems aren't as easy."
"It's called embarrassingly parallelized, like I said the list of 100 that you just send 50 this way and send 50 the other way."
Some problems just aren't that easy to parallelize.
Some problems can't be parallelized.
"And then you have to, there's time to hand out work to different workers."
"Eh, what does this mean?"
"We want, need to send the data around between the different cores."
"All the workers, each computer doesn't always work as fast."
Especially when you work in cluster and cloud computing.
"Each computer, some computers die, some computers are slower, some computers fail."
It happens.
You have to deal with it.
"Eh, there may be contention for shared resources."
"If you try to use the list you can't be changing it all the time because you might get problems, and we'll talk about that in five minutes."
Workers could be overwriting each others answers.
That's the idea.
"You have to wait for the last, slowest worker to come back."
And this is the weakest link.
And there's time to put the data together after you've done all the parallel parts.
"Specifically, in lab this week we're going to have a compitition."
"Ooo, fun."
We're going to see how fast you guys can sort a shuffled deck of cards.
We'll have a classwide compitition and you'll actually tackle all these problems.
"So let's say, time to hand out small work"" units"" to workers, you have to maybe pass out cards between each other."
Some of you sort slower than others and we'll see how it works.
"No way."""
"So Les did a finer study, and he found out it came out about 9,000."
"Using different microsatellites gave the different results, but the mean of all these studies is about 5,000, which I personally don't believe."
"But then, I am a skeptic."
"But even if you toss a few numbers around, you're probably talking an effective population of about 20,000 animals."
Do you remember how many they killed off Achill in the 70s and the 50s?
"So what it tells us, actually, is that there's actually a risk of extinction of this species because its population is so small."
"In fact, of those 20,000, 8,000 were thought to be females."
"There's only 8,000 basking shark females in the world?"
I don't know.
I don't believe it.
The problem with this is they were constrained with samples.
They didn't get enough samples to really explore the genetics in enough detail.
"So, where do you get samples from for your genetic analysis?"
"Well, one obvious source is dead sharks -- dead sharks, washed up."
"We might get two or three dead sharks washed up in Ireland a year, if we're kind of lucky."
Another source would be fisheries' bycatch.
We were getting quite a few caught in surface drift nets.
"That's banned now, and that'll be good news for the sharks."
"And some are caught in nets, in trawls."
"This is a shark that was actually landed in Howth just before Christmas -- illegally, because you're not allowed to do that under EU law -- and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak."
"They even put a recipe up on the wall, until they were told it was illegal."
They actually did get a fine for that.
"So if you look at all those studies I showed you, the total number of samples worldwide is 86, at present."
"So it's very important work, and they can ask some really good questions, and tell us about population size and subpopulations and structure, but they're constrained by lack of samples."
"When we were out tagging our sharks -- this is how we tagged them on the front of a RlB, get in there fast -- occasionally, the sharks do react."
"On one occasion, when we were up in Malin Head in Donegal, the shark smacked the side of the boat with his tail, more, I think, in startle to the fact that a boat came near it, rather than the tag going in."
And that was fine.
We got wet.
No problem.
"And then when myself and Emmett got back to Malin Head, to the pier,"
I noticed some black slime on the front of the boat.
"So what we're going to look at is a real simplification kind of taking that problem, kind of distilling it down to its essences and looking at just six operations that are kind of at the core of any text editor about moving the cursor forward and backwards with these commands."
Jumping to the front and the back of the entire buffer and then inserting and deleting in relative to the cursor within that buffer.
And we're going to do this with an extremely old school interface that's actually command base.
It's like VI comes back from the dead for those of you who have ever heard of such things as VI and E Max.
"And so we're going to look at this because there's actually a lot of ways you can approach that, that take advantage of some of the things that we've already built like the vector, and stacking queue, and the link list."
And sort of think about what kind of options play out well.
What I'm going to show you first off is just what the tool looks like so you can really feel schooled in the old way of doing things.
"So I insert the characters A, B, C, D, E, F, G into the editor."
And then I can use the command B to backup.
"I can use the command J to jump to the beginning, E to jump to the end, and so F and B,"
"B moving me backwards, F moving me forwards, and then once I'm at a place, let's say I jump to the end, I can insert Z, Z,"
"Y, X here at the beginning and it'll slide things over, and then I can delete characters shuffling things down."
So that's what we've got.
"Imagine now, it's like building"
Microsoft Word on top of this.
"There's a lot of stuff that goes, you know, between here and there. but it does give you an idea that the kind of core data requirements every word processor needs some tool like this some abstraction underneath it to manage the character data."
Okay.
Where do we start?
Where do we start?
Anyone want to propose an implementation.
What's the easiest thing to do?
[Inaudible].
In a way.
Something like that.
"You know, and if you think Array, then you should immediately think after it, no, I don't want to deal with Array, I want a vector."
I'd like a vector.
Vector please.
Right.
"So I'm going to show you what the interface looks like, here, that we have a buffer in these six operations."
"We're going to think about what the private part looks like, and we say, what about vector."
"Vector handles big, you know, chunky things indexed by slots."
That might be a good idea.
"I'm going to print out each word that's in small_words applied to ""The quick brown fox."""
I'm just sort of eyeballing it.
"""The"" and ""fox"" are at most 3 letters, so I hope to see these 2 in the answer, but ""quick"" and ""brown"" are too big to make the final cut, and that's exactly what we got out."
Recall that our goal was to enumerate all the strings in a grammar.
That was our super slow approach to check and see if HTML or JavaScript was valid.
"Well, unsurprisingly, these generators are the trick we're going to use to enumerate a lot of strings in a concise manner."
"All right, let's go through the possible answers together."
We're definitely going to match 1368 because it's in the language of this regular expression.
It's 4 copies of 0-9 together.
"By default, the value of the token, that is, when it comes into us, it's just the string 1368."
"But we're going to convert it to an integer using this cast or conversion here, so at the end of the day, it's going to be 1368."
It's not going to be the string 1368 because we have this special conversion.
It's not going to be the string 1 because the maximal munch rule means that we're not going to match just one.
We match all 4 digits.
"Similarly, it's not going to be the integer 1 because we match 1368."
It's also not going to be the empty string.
"We definitely match 1368, and 1368 is a good number to match."
That's the approximate year when the Ming Dynasty started.
"They featured a strong central government in China, but perhaps they're best known because most of the Great Wall that we can see was either built or repaired during the Ming Dynasty."
This is my Great Wall sketch.
"You can tell it's the Great Wall because it's got a label that says ""Great Wall."""
"Cranial nerves IX and X, which are the Glossopharyngeal and Vagus nerves, mediate the sensory and motor functions of the palate, pharynx, and larynx."
Practitioner:
I'd like to take a look at the back of your throat.
Can you open your mouth?
[fades]
"To test these nerves, ask the patient to say,"
"""Aaaah,"" or yawn as you observe the soft palate and the uvula."
"The soft palate should rise promptly and symmetrically, and the uvula should remain midline."
"Next, test the gag reflex, one side at a time."
"Using a tongue blade, touch one side of the pharynx, then the other."
"You should see a prompt rise of the palate, and other signs of gagging."
How did we do code review?
How did you earn your authority?
There was nothing quite like it before.
When we started the foundation we remade ourselves over again.
"We were, as I said, a small number of people, we made a bet on a new product that was Firefox."
We didn't have a product to ship at that time.
"And Asa with our community involvement continued to ship the Mozilla suite for fifteen months, as the only product we had in the marketplace until Firefox was ready."
"We made that bet, which is a scary bet."
"Imagine not to have a browser,"
I mean we didn't have a person working on the product we were shipping.
But we did that because we knew that Firefox was our opportunity to make a commercial product.
Our first five or six years of life taught us that technology alone will not change the industry the way we want to.
Technology alone does not change people's lives the way we want to do that.
Our opportunity with the browser is to have a product that touches people.
Yeah.
[Question]
Yeah.
So that's where I'm trying to get to.
"That technology alone is not enough, that raw power of technology is not enough, that if you really want to touch people, not us, not power users, not developers but if you want to touch consumers and change their lives, you have to be utterly committed to that."
You can't build the features that you want just because you want them.
You can't tell people:
"""Oh, you should behave this way, you should want to be this way."""
You have to build the product that is elegant and beautiful and powerful under the covers but that people love.
That was the first thing.
That is a big change.
Many open source projects never make that change.
I started calling it the tyranny of the product.
If you are serious about wanting to touch hundreds of millions of people you have to be committed to those hundreds of millions of people.
"You can't just think they're stupid, or they don't understand."
You have to really be committed to making their lives better.
So that's what Firefox do.
"So we didn't rewrite all these switches, and all the preferences the way our first product had."
"*The FBI with the help of local police agencies, systematically fed false accusations and fake news articles to the press *"
*accusing me and other activists of crimes we did not commit. *
"*Although in my case the charges were eventually dropped, or I was eventually acquitted, *"
"*the national and local police agencies created a situation where based on their false accusations against me, *"
*any police officer could shoot me on sight. *
*It was not until the Freedom of Information Act was passed in the mid-70's *
*that we began to see the scope of the United States governments' persecution of political activists.*
"*At this point, I think that it is important to make one thing very clear. *"
*I have advocated and I still advocate revolutionary changes in the structure and in the principles that govern the United States *
"*I advocate self determination for my people, and for all oppressed people inside the United States. *"
"*I advocate an end to capitalist exploitation, *"

"*I was taken to a local hospital where I was threatened, beaten and tortured. *"
*In 1977 I was convicted in a trial that can only be described as a legal lynching.*
*In 1979 I was able to escape with the aid of some of my fellow comrades. *
"*I saw this as a necessary step, not only because I was innocent of the charges against me, *"
*but because I knew that in the racist legal system in the United States I would receive no justice. *
*I was also afraid that I would be murdered in prison. *

Let's do one more.
I think that's all I have time for.
Let's do minus one ninth minus one over four.
Well the least common multiple of nine and four is thirty-six.
So that's equal to thirty-six.
So what's negative one ninth where we change the denominator from nine to thirty-six?
"Well, we multiply nine times four to get thirty-six."
We have to multiply the numerator times four as well.
"So we have negative one, so it becomes negative four."
Then minus one over thirty-six.
"Well to go from four to thirty-six, we have to multiply this fraction by nine, or we have to multiply the denominator by nine, so you also have to multiply the numerator by nine."
One times nine is nine.
"So this equals minus four minus nine over thirty-six, which equals minus thirteen over thirty-six."
I think that's all I have time for right now.
And I'll probably add a couple more modules.
But I think that right now that you might be ready to do the adding and subtracting module.
Have fun.
Now we are ready to begin talking about actual program optimizations and we begin with local optimizations.
"Local optimization is the simplest form of program optimization because it focuses on optimizing just a single basic block, so just one basic block and, in particular, there is no need worry about complicated control flow, we are not going to be looking at the entire method or procedure body."
Let's dive right in and take a look at a couple of simple local optimizations.
"If x is an integer valued variable And from here on, we'll assume that x has type-ins."
So let me just write that down.
We're going to assume that x has type-ins in all of our examples on this slide.
"Then the statement x=x+0, well that doesn't change the value of x."
Zero is the additive identity for +.
We're just going to assign x the value it currently has.
And so this statement is actually useless.
It can just be deleted from the program.
"Similarly, for x=x*1."
"Multiplying by one will not change the value of X, and so that statement can also be removed."
And in this case these are great optimizations because we actually save an entire instruction.
"Now, some statements can't be deleted, but they can be simplified."
What kind of.
What are some tips can you give people who are in that stage of the publication process?
"Well first of all although acceptance of the revision is not, is not guaranteed that we will see so in the letter."
Yeah.
"I think he should take that as, as encouraging."
Yeah.
In fact that had got has that first reviewing stage is really a good sign and you should work hard to.
Improve the paper so it will get accepted.
Yeah.
"And The First of all, either whatever the you know, first of all, list each comment that the reviewers make, and respond to that."
"It makes it much easier as an editor to, to, to be able to see that the author took into account every comment that e, that, that both reviewers, or as many reviewers were involved, made."
"And the editor will often make comments too, and list them, and respond to each one separately."
"And Either, whatever the comment says."
"Either fix it, fix what the problem is."
"Or explain why you, you don't think that, that criticism is, is valid or important."
Explain why you don't want to fix it.
"And make, you know, give a good argument for that."
Show And also please show the editor where you made the changes in the manuscript.
They'll.
"You know if someone says I just change th-, the method section to reflect this."
"That's sort of hard for us to find wh-, what exactly you did, so, either highlight the change, list the changes in, when you respond to the comments, either highlight them in the manuscript and say, you know, say where they occur, highlight them, or use track changes supply in addition to the, The version where you get rid of the track changes also provide the version that has track changes, so that the editor can see exactly what you did."
Yeah.
"Or sometimes, sometimes a paper will be sent out for further, review, further peer review."
"Sometimes the peer reviewers have really strong concerns, and I as an editor will say, will send it back to them and say did, did the author really satisfy your concerns about this?"
And be polite.
[laugh].
"Yeah, don't like he just said that."
"You know, that, that, oh, this, this reviewers stupid."
You know.
[laugh].
But he didn't really.
"We just say, oh, we thank the reviewers for their constructive criticisms."
But the rest of them I just make on the fly because they usually don't have any data in them.
- Also Wonder Helper functions.
- Wonder Helper functions?
- Nice.
Just a couple of quick examples on how to write very simple formatters.
This one here just takes an NSArray and puts it with a bunch of page breaks between it.
"You can easily deal with a little WORepetition and a string, but then you've got another component with a WORepetition and String or you've got part of your component that is less reusable than it could be because it's inside of it."
"That ""return buffer.append"" in the format command is the entire implementation of the formatter, and it's not particularly difficult."
We're not going to bother parsing this so I just throw an exception.
"But, those are the only two methods you actually have to implement to make a formatter."
"If you're doing output only, it can be as simple as one line long."
A little bit more complex example.
This one here converts between separators in a string.
"I'm working on a system now as a bunch of legacy stuff, and some things are comma separated and some things are tab separated."
I use a formatter to move things back and forth.
"You can also do the same thing if you've got a string of text that somebody's typed in a text box and you want to format it out in HTML to keep the page breaks, it'll do that."
"If you've got a bunch of HTML like from an XML file or something and you want to convert it back into a paragraph, it'll do that."
"Again, there's really only two lines in it that do anything."
"The format one just does, just calls a replace along the string from the internal to the external."
The parsing just changes it backwards.
That's all you need to do.
"The only thing special, if you notice the first line in the parsed object, it was position set indexed string length."
You just have to set it to something.
"If you leave it at zero, Java will throw an exception for you."
"Just set it at something, keep Java happy."
There you go.
"Formats and parses, there's only really two lines of code."
"If you start using them, you'll find all kinds of places you can use them."
I like them a lot.
No comments?
- Position set index can be or even important if you're chaining format is to give one inside the other because you don't know where you're starting and ending in the paths for the next one.
"- Yes, but usually I try to keep them fairly simple."
"Cauliflower, when you get it, comes with this green stuff around and it's kind of hard to get in to."
"So, what I do is just peel back some of these leaves - get my knife in there and once you get a few pieces out, it gets easier."
"So, just pull those out."
"Once you slice one of them, you want to make sure to take one out because it will dry out."
"And since I slice this top off here, I want to take those as well, and the rest of it you can put back in its plastic bag and save."
"It is better if you can use the whole thing at once, but this is lunch for Phil and I, the entire cauliflower would be a bit much."
This is going to get dry out a little bit but just do the best you can.
I'm going to put it back into the plastic bag that it came in and pop it back in the fridge.
"So, you want to wash up your cauliflower, just make sure that there's not dirt or anything like that on it."
"One of the things that I really love with this kitchen is the first place that Phil and I had been that doesn't have a microwave, which is awesome because we don't use microwave and it kind of gets in the way of the use of space in the cupboards."
"The last place we lived in we used the microwave for storage actually, but cupboards are much more efficient, so we were excited about that."
"Alright, so get your cauliflower cut up and"
I'm going to cut it into bite size pieces.
"At his point, is you want to, you can steam this or boil it."
"I'm just going to have it raw because we're having it for lunch and lunch is when I like to get raw vegetables because it's the warmest part of your day and the most active and most able to handle those cooling raw foods, especially in winter time in Ottawa - it's pretty cold here."
"Alright, so there is Phil's bowl, he always eats more than me - he's a guy and bigger than I am."
I'm just going to pour some of the sauce over the top.
"You can use as much or as little as you like - that's look pretty good, some on mine."
Here you go my lovely simple garlic herb sauce recipe over cauliflower.
You can have a few chopped onions or some parsley on top there if you a garnish - it's very easy to make if you have a bean dip already made.

Hi there.
"I'm Tucker Balch, and this is Computational Investing, Part one."
"I hope you're doing great. this module is about information and the efficient market hypothesis and we're going to begin taking a look at something called event studies. objectives for this module we're going to look at what are the most common sources of information that you can leverage for investing. learn how information relates to company value and we're going to look at the three versions of the efficient markets hypothesis that are important and the, the, the effect of what we're doing here. and finally in this module we'll look at event studies, how they work and talk about the next assignment for you involving event studies. okay. now, nearly all quantitative-based investing is based on some kind of arbitraged model."
"And, and in, in particular, what we are looking at is an arbitrage between what the price of the equity is on the market and what we believe its, its true value is. so I'm going to draw a blue line here and let's, let's presume that that's the true underlying value of the, of the equity."
"How we, how we get that true value, that's a different topic, but let's assume somehow we know what it is."
"The, the arbitrage comes about when we well, we, we presume that the price on the market should be very close to that true value."
And if it diverges significantly that's an opportunity to either buy or sell the stock on the presumption that it's going to return back to its true value.
"So, if the quoted market price is significantly below the true value, that's a buying opportunity."
And we know the price is going to revert back to the true price or if it's significantly above the true value that's a shorting opportunity.
"And we presume that it's going to go back down to that true value. now another important thing to remember is let me save that real quick. another important thing to remember is that we're always talking here about, about market, market relative in the new image here, okay we're, we're looking for market relat ive value, you know, and, and in particular let me let me draw a line here where the, the, you know, the, the, the price of the market and by, by that I mean S and P 500 varies over time. we're looking for a value relative to that."
You can see that it actually doesn't technically take us to the error.
It takes us to the line after.
Sometimes these kinds of tools will get you close and then you'll have to figure it out from there.
"So, the problem is right here: you see that local user ID colon -1 doesn't have a comma after it, it just ends and since it was expecting a comma, well Javascript inserts a semicolon, and that causes issues."
So let's go ahead and fix that one.
Okay.
"So if we insert that comma there, and then reload the page, we get our next syntax error at line 103 and the error here is that functions expect parenthesis after them where the perameters are."
Even if it doesn't take any perameters it still expects parenthesis here.
Let's go ahead and add those in.
And again reload the page.
And we get to our next error.
And this one is way down on line 207.
"Now this is maybe a little bit harder to see, but the problem is right here, ""this:currentTick"" should have a dot, as see down here, rather than a colon, since we use dots to access member methods and variables."
"Okay, so now that we've fixed this here, and then reload, we get to another error on 318."
"And here we can see on line 318 that we have a comma here, where normally we would use a colon to specify a member method."
"So, if we fix that and then reload the page, we can see that we don't have any syntax errors left."
"And, those are the only ones that we put in."
"So, you can see that it was a lot easier to go through the developer tools and fix these things as necessary, as it pointed it out to us, rather than trying to walk through the code line-by-line manually."
"So, I hope that shows how useful it is to have the proper tools on hand."
...
"I've kept my eyes open and seen that a new time is coming and that something is happening to the people, that has never happened before."
And you see people walking around like you've never seen before.
"That's because all that was at the bottom, is now rising."
"And where there were one individual and another individual, there is now the mass, the mass- man."
"And one will stick together, and not go home to oneself any more."
"I can guarantee you that you'll get food while you're waiting, and that you'll get through this, safe and sound."
For now we are on the threshold of the land that belongs to us.
I don't fight anymore!
Take the chance!
"To the left, asshole!"
Get in behind Fatzer
Forwards!
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
I'll roll that for you now.
This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
"And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor."
And it worked.
And it gave the studio great relief.
"After many years of starts and stops on this project, and making that tough decision, they finally decided to greenlight the movie."
"And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us, to say the movie was a go,"
I actually threw up.
(Laughter)
"You know, this is some tough stuff."
"So we started to have early team meetings, and we got everybody together, and it was really more like therapy in the beginning, convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this."
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
"And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem."
(Laughter)
So we had a big problem: we didn't know how we were going to do this.
But we did know one thing.
"Being from the visual effects industry, we, with David, believed that we now had enough time, enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money."
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
"So, when you're faced with something like that, of course you've got to break it down."
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that.
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
We needed to make Brad look a lot older -- needed to age him 45 years or so.
"And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies, his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen."
"And we also needed to create a character that could hold up under, really, all conditions."
"He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight, at nighttime, under candlelight, he had to hold an extreme close-up, he had to deliver dialogue, he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat, he had to be able to take a bath, to cry, he even had to throw up."
"Not all at the same time -- but he had to, you know, do all of those things."
And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.
We did about 325 shots.
Programs can block.
It's not sensitive to blockage the way that event loops are.
"In fact, it loves to block."
The whole reason they have threads is so that they can block.
"Execution will continue as long as any thread is not blocked, and if you have multiple cores and if they're not blocking each other, they can all go forward and that's a good thing."
Maybe your program will go faster if you're lucky.
There are some cons.
One is that you need to allocate stack memory per thread.
"That was once a big deal; it's not a big deal now, memory's so cheap and abundant."
"A real concern, though, is if two threads are using the same memory, a race may occur, which is even worse than saying a race will occur."
I'll show you what I mean by that in a moment.
"There are more cons, but before we do that..."
"For years, people have been saying 'why can't we have threads in JavaScript?', so let me show you what happens when you have threads in JavaScript."
"Here we've got two one line programs which are each going to run as a thread, both at the same time, and they are both sharing access to my_array."
Each is going to append one element to my_array.
There are several possible outcomes of this.
One of them is that we get an array containing a and b.
Another is that we get an array containing b and a.
"This is not the race I'm talking about, although you do have this non-determinism, and that's considered good."
Let me show you what's considered bad.
"One possible outcome is we get just a or just b, even though both successfully completed their rights."
How is that possible?
Anybody have a question as to how this went wrong?
Let me show you what went wrong.
One way you can look at appending something to an array is to break it down into several more primitive instructions.
"When you do that first statement, you're doing the equivalent of the last four statements."
Everybody see how that works?
OK.
"Now, when you have threads, they're both doing similar stuff and they can shuffle the order of the execution of the stuff in any way that they want."
"They might do it always the same way, or they might occasionally do it a different way."
The way they'll usually do it is they'll work fine when you do it in development and do it in a really bad way when you're in production.
[laughter]
"So, when you trade it in they actually instead of you getting money for that car, you owe more for the new car you are buying and if you keep doing that eventually you will be really, really upside down."
"So really, really watch that."
It is better if you do finance it to finance it for two years or three years because you are probably going to keep it and at the end of that two or three years it is probably going to be worth more than what you owe on it if you decide to trade it in.
"We pay cash, so, I don't know a lot about that."
"But also, if you do that at the end of those three years you are going to have your car paid off instead of never getting a car paid off."
Okay?
And I know when we were younger we couldn't do that.
We couldn't pay cash for a car.
We had to go in you know and finance a car.
"But, we never financed it for five or six years like they are allowing you to do now."
Let's go on and look at page 200.
I want to really call your attention to this because you are going to use this on a project that you are going to do at the end of the semester for me.
"But, if you look on page 200, Automobile Operation Costs."
"That is something you have to consider and along with the information they have there, I want you to understand gas costs."
It is the annual mileage divided by the miles per gallon times the average cost of gasoline.
"So, you have to take, this is how much I drive this car annually and then I divide it by how many miles per gallon it gets and then I take that and multiply it times the average gas rate for that year."
And then that will tell you about how much money you are spending for gas cost.
"The cost per mile, take that total cost and divide by the number of miles that you have driven the car that year."
Okay?
It talks about maintenance.
You have to take that into consideration when you are thinking about how much a car costs.
"And then the next thing that your book goes into talking about, Resolving Consumer Complaints."
And I want you to read this.
There is a lot of information in here.
So many people just
let people run all over them and you shouldn't do that.
You have rights as a consumer.
And this chapter talks about those rights all the way up to the point of finally just taking some legal action.
And I know we live in a society of everyone sues everyone.
You know when you spill a cup of coffee and you sue the people who give it to you as if you didn't know that the cup of coffee was going to be hot!
Well then there is a problem.
Now it is one thing if someone from that business spills the coffee on you.
Thought it would be useful to have a problem session.
Let's see if we can work the following problem.
"So our problem says, suppose we have a source, right here."
"And just one millimeter away, we have a sink, right there."
"What is the potential that results, form this source and sink?"
"At this point up here, A."
And what is the potential that results from this source and sink at this point b.
"If you notice this diagram is not to scale, it gives you the idea that the separation along the x axis between the source and sink is small only one unit."
And both the source and sync are a long ways a way from either field point a or field point b because field point a and b are ten units away on the z axis.
"So if we take these segments, in turn we can say look this problem is done readily enough but the fact that we have a equation that gives us the potential to a source and sink combination, We compute 5p as I0 over four pi sigma R etc."
And if we specialize that to our particular situation we'd say that means that pi over A is equal to I zero over four pi sigma.
"One over R, minus one over R prime."
"If we go over to our diagram and we say, how much is r and how much is r prime?"
"Well, r is the distance to the source."
"R is the distance from field point a, where we're computing the potential, to the source."
That's distance r.
R prime is the distance from the field point A to the sink.
"Now if you look at these, this problem you would say hm."
R and R prime are just about the same.
Cuz A is a long way from the source and a
long way from the sank.
"So surely the answer here is zero, or if not zero, inconsequential."
"It seems like that would be the case, but it's just not true."
"The difference between R and R-prime may be small, but there is a difference."
"And because there's a difference, this term, one over R, minus one over R-prime is definitely not equal to zero."
"I'll write that up here, too, just for emphasis."
That term is not equal to zero.
"And as a result, when you compute phi A."
"It will have, a definite number value."
I'll leave it up to you to complete the calculation.
"If we now move on and look at the second part, the b part of the, of the problem session question, it's the same question, except it just asks for a different field point."
Now we're asking for b rather than a.
So I have order n operations at each level in the tree.
And then how many levels deep am I?
"Well, that's the divide, right?"
So how many levels do I have?
"Log n, because at each stage I'm cutting the problem in half."
So I start off with n then it's n over two n over four n over eight.
"So I have n operations log n times, there we go, n log n."
"Took us a long time to get there, but it's a nice algorithm to have."
Let me generalize this slightly.
"When we get a problem, a standard tool to try and attack it with is to say, is there some way to break this problem down into simpler, I shouldn't say simpler, smaller versions of the same problem."
"If I can do that, it's a good candidate for divide and conquer."
And then the things I have to ask is how much of a division do I want to do?
"The obvious one is to divide it in half, but there may be cases where there are different divisions you want to have take place."
The second question I want to ask is what's the base case?
When do I get down to a problem that's small enough that it's basically trivial to solve?
Here it was lists of size one.
I could have stopped at lists of size two right.
That's an easy comparison.
"Do one comparison and return one of two possible orders on it, but I need to decide that."
And the third thing I need to decide is how do I combine?
"You know, point out to you in the binary search case, combination was trivial."
The answer to the final search was just the answer all the way up.
"Here, a little more work, and that's why I'll come back to that idea."
"If I'm basically just squeezing jello, that is, I'm trying to make the problem simpler, but the combination turns out to be really complex, I've not gained anything."
"So things that are good candidates for divide and conquer are problems where it's easy to figure out how to divide down, and the combination is of"
little complexity.
"It would be nice if it was less than linear, but linear is nice because then I'm going to get that n log in kind of behavior."
"And if you ask the TAs in recitation tomorrow, they'll tell you that you see a lot of n log n algorithms in computer science."
"It's a very common class of algorithms, and it's very useful one to have."
"Now, one of the questions we could still ask is, right, we've got binary search, which has got this nice log behavior."
"If we can sort things, you know, we get this n log n behavior, and we got a n log n behavior overall."
But can we actually do better in terms of searching.
"And, so lets figure out what happened at event number one."
So let's say that the twin on earth measured a time T1.
"And therefore twin on the, the twin that was traveling measured a time T prime one."
Now where did this event occurred.
"Well this event occurred at the position. x1 which is equal to vt1 because the twin was moving with speed v, but it also occurred at position x prime one."
And we know what x prime one is.
"X prime one is zero because in his own frame, the moving twin was addressed and therefore we could now set, the point is that we can now compute the invariant interval between here and here in the two different frames and set it to be the same."
"So, that tells us, and again"
"I'm not gonna maintain all of the colors, that c squared, t1 squared minus x1 squared."
Has to be equal to'c' squared't1' prime squared minus'x1' prime squared.
"But we know some things, we know'x1' prime is zero, we know that'x1' is'vt1'."
"So, c squared t1 squared minus v squared, t1 squared is c squared t1 prime squared and we do the usual calculation and we find that t1 prime is t1 times the square root."
Of one minus V squared over C squared.
"Or, written otherwise, t1 is t1 prime / by the square root of one - v^2 over c^2."
"So that, what we are saying is that this event appears to the stationary twin to have, happened at a later time than it appears to the moving twin."
Why do I know it's a later time?
Because I'm dividing by a number smaller than one.
"Well, yeah, you say, of course."
"But on the other hand, I can draw this line."
"And say that is true, but that's because I am measuring the time at event one."
I can invent an event number two here.
"Which is simultaneous with the, the, the moving twins decision to return and that event number two clearly occurs at a time."
Earlier than T one.
And if I compute I will find that in fact T two.
Is exactly't1' prime times you can compute this.
It's again these two happened at the same value of't' prime but one happened at the'x' equals zero and one happened at'x' prime equals zero.
"And the symmetry between these is of course the usual understanding that we have the stationary twin sees time dilation, sees the moving twin's clock running slow and the moving twin sees the stationary twin's clock running slow ."
So.
The twin whose coordinates are black thinks that his brother is aging slowly.
The twin whose coordinates are blue thinks his brother is aging slowly.
"So how is it that upon, but on the other hand, it is clear that since from at this point t1 is less, is clearly more than t1 prime and since this is t1 prime is how much the moving twin aged, t1 is how much the stationary twin aged."
"Since the same thing is now repeated on their return, it's clear that if this is true, then 2t1 = 2t1 prime / that and upon their return the stationary twin will be older."
But if you spill it on yourself you should know that it is going to burn and it is going to be hot!
It is coffee.
As a matter of fact I bet you would be angry if your coffee wasn't hot!
"I don't know, I don't drink it."
I imagine you would be.
Haha.
"So, I am not talking about that kind of litigation, but I am talking about you deserve the product that you were promised."
And this chapter does a good job of giving you some information on that so make sure you read all about that.
"As I look at the end of the chapter, once again, make sure you go through the chapter summary."
"There are the Key Terms, make sure you understand those."
There is some self-test problems.
There are no formulas this week in here so that is good.
But the same end of chapter information as always.
"So, I hope that with major purchases in your future that this chapter has really helped you."
And I hope the next time you buy a car you will take into consideration some of the things I have shared with you and some of the things that you read in your book.
"So, happy shopping!"
Let's review a little bit of everything we learned so far and hopefully it'll make everything fit together a little bit better.
Then we'll do a bunch of calculations with real numbers and I think it'll really hit the point home.
"So, first of all if we're dealing with a-- let me actually write down, let me make some columns."
"So if we're dealing with-- let's see, we could call it the concept and then we'll call it whether we're dealing with a population or a sample."
So the first statistical concept we came up with was the notion of the mean or the central tendency and we learned of that was one way to measure the average or central tendency of a data set.
The other ways were the median and the mode.
"But the mean tends to show up a lot more, especially when we start talking about variances and, as we'll do in this video, the standard deviation."
But the mean of a population we learned-- we use the greek
letter Mu-- is equal to the sum of each of the data points in the population.
That's an i.
Let me make sure it looks like an I.
So you're going to sum up each of those data points.
You're going to start with the first one and you're going to go to the nth one.
We're assuming that there are n data points in the population.
And then you divide by the total number that you have.
In fact there is research on CEOs.
"CEOs tend to be tall and attractive, and that's just not fair is it?"
But that's just status; that's having an effect on decisions that are made in cooperations.
Age.
Sometimes we don't look with as much respect on people who are older or younger.
We see them as immature or maybe out of date.
"And so these are some status variables that affect groups, and hopefully, that isn't going to be a factor that prevents those variables from people from contributing in an equal way."
"Now, we're going to talk about attained status next."
Ascribed status is somethings you bring into the room.
When you come into that meeting you bring it with you.
"You have your clothes on; you have your job, your economic status."
"It's all already in your past, but attained status is different."
It's something you build.
It's something you actually develop in the group itself once the meetings start.
"So we're going to call this more of a internal type of status that maybe you do some really neat things for the group, and you help them solve problem."
"Everybody's proud of you, and you're a hero in your group."
"You've done some amazing stuff, and so now you have high attained status."
"People almost want to start listening to your ideas because you were the one who worked through the last situation, successfully."
"Or maybe of low status because you had this idea, and the group went with it, and it didn't work very well."
And now we've got to go back and fix that a little bit.
"Well, you've lost some status; you're credibility is a little lower now."
"So, that's what we call attained status."
We'll be paying attention to that in this course.
The third thing we're going to look at is power.
And I think if you're in the work place you know that you have to be able to use power in a healthy way.
So we're going to talk about some of these types of power.
"And when we look at this type of power, we have things like legitimate power."
"Now, legitimate power is power that you're given by being chosen, and you actually have, you've been given the assignment to be in charge of a group."
Another one of these is what we call referent power.
"Now, I want to you to pay special attention to referent power."
Put an asterisk next to that one.
"That is actually the ideal form of power, if you can have referent power and use referent power."
The people just run the machines.
So it's much more efficient to have to do it through more machines and less through more workers in automobile production.
"So in that case you could have a steeper expansion path, where basically the marginal product of labor is falling relative to the marginal product of capital, so you want to increase the ratio of capital to labor over time."
"The bottom line is as firms produce more, they may hold constant or may change the ratio of their inputs, but they'll clearly use more inputs."
"They're going to use more inputs, but the mix of the inputs they'll use will change with their production levels."
"So the question we have to ask is, well, what's going to determine their production level?"
Where does q come from?
I'll have to leave that as a teaser for next time.
"Let me just say where q comes from, is q is going to come from market competition."
We're going to get q--
"I'm not done, I have one more thing to cover."
But we're going to get q from market competition.
Now there is one other thing I want to cover though related to costs.
"Which is an important concept that we have to have in the back of our mind, which when we come back, we think about competition."
Which is fixed versus sunk cost.
"Fixed-- my wife always thought I was saying some costs, I'm not."
I'm saying sunk costs.
Fixed versus sunk costs.
Fixed versus sunk costs.
Sunk costs are costs which are fixed even in the long-run.
"Fixed costs are costs which are fixed in the short-run, and variable in the long-run, so capital."
Sunk costs are costs which are fixed in the long-run.
"That is, they're foregone once you produce."
"The minute you produce one unit, those sunk costs are gone forever, and they cannot be changed even in the long-run."
"In other words, importantly, they cannot be changed by how much you produce."
"So in the long-run, you can change the cost of capital by building bigger or smaller plants, producing more or less."
But some costs cannot be changed.
So what's a classic example?
"Well, the classic example for example would be medical education, or any professional education."
"Once you've gone to med school and done all your grueling years of staying up all night, you've paid those costs."
"They're now paid for, and it doesn't matter if you see three patients the rest of your life or three million patients the rest of your life, you've already paid those costs."
Think of that as the capital of a doctor's office.
"You could see that in the next page, figure 9-3."
Imagine that wages went up.
"So imagine now wages, instead of being $5 an hour, are $7.50 an hour."
"They pass a new minimum wage, and wages go up to $7.50 an hour."
What does that do?
"Well, that steepens the isocost."
"Your trade-off is now you're going to get fewer workers for every machine you give up, or more machines for every worker you give up."
"And so at the same isoquant, that's going to shift you to using less labor and more capital."
"By the same logic as before, you're going to use less labor and more capital, because you're going to see this shift in relative prices."
This figure shows why the minimum wage leads to unemployment.
We talked about it last time.
"We did in a graph, we just said supply and demand and showed you."
But actually this is the underlying mechanics of how minimum wage leads to unemployment.
"Because the minimum wage, by change, is relative input prices."
"If the only way you could produce things was with labor, there wouldn't be much unemployment for a minimum wage because basically you wouldn't have anything else you could do."
You'd still have to hire the workers.
"But, in fact, that's not the only way to produce things."
You can substitute to capital.
"As a minimum wage goes up, firms will substitute towards capital, and that's why the minimum wage will lead to unemployment."
So this is sort of the underlying mechanics of how that happens.
"All right, now armed with that-- so basically when we did consumer theory we were done here."
"We basically said, look, we now know you have a budget constraint, you have indifference curves, you're fine with their tangent, you're done."
"The reason firms are one step harder is you don't have a budget constraint. q is not given to you, q is ultimately decided by you."
You the firm are going to decide on little q.
"With our example for consumers, your parents gave you $96, you had no choice."
"Well here the firm isn't given little q, it's going to decide little q."
What that means is we're not done yet.
"There's one extra step we need to do with firms, which is figure out where little q comes from."
"So to do that, we're going to have to then say well, how does a firm think about the set of choices of little q?"
And how does it think about how it changes production as
little q changes?
"So to see that, go to figure 9-4a."
"Which is that when you stop the front end of the garage, of the ladder, you also stop the"
left end of the ladder.
"Remember, that at this point the right end of the ladder smashes into a wall, and it stops."
"Now, what is going to happen is the back end of the ladder just lik e our slinky, when I dropped it has not yet heard that the front end of the ladder has crashed into something."
The left end of the ladder continues to come at speed v until somebody tells it.
What tells it?
"Well, a sound wave, of course will be propagating down this ladder as the front end of it crumples, propagating back to tell the back end of the ladder, wait, there is an extra force, we need to stop."
How fast does the sound wave travel?
"Well that depends on what the ladder is made of, but I know a limit."
"The sound wave will not travel back to the ladder in it's own frame, or in any other frame that's happily an invariant faster then the speed of light."
"So at this event when the front end of the ladder crashes into the door, you can imagine a sound wave propagating back up the ladder to the left, trying to tell the left end to stop."
"So, how fast can this signal propagate?"
"Well, this is the fastest it can propagate."
"The fastest that the rear end of the ladder can hear, but the front has stopped, is the speed of"
light.
"So I've drawn a light speed, 45 degree propagation of the signal from the back of the ladder, from the front of the ladder to the back telling it to stop."
"And if this were the case. you notice that by the time this light being reaches the back end of the ladder, back end of the ladder is well within the garage because even in the ladder frame, we are now talking about a positive time."
Right?
"And so, time has"
"The, the, remember, the left end of the ladder entered the garage here."
"By now, the left end of the ladder is well in the garage."
If you stop the front end of the
"ladder, the back end would keep coming."
"You would not, be able to stop it until it was in the garage."
"Now, what happens at the moment."
To the actual ladder when the soundwave) propagates and reaches the back.
Well the energies involved are such that most ladders would probably blow themselves up to smithereenes or crumble to atoms.
But in any event by the time the rear end of the ladder appears that the front end has stopped.
And ma ybe we have a very powerful ladder and it's elastic and it springs back out and re-expands by the time all that and crashes into the garage door.
"But the time, by the time all of that, any of that happens the ladder is well within the garage."
And so the fact that you managed to close the doors.
"Is not an interruption when you close the doors. at this event, the ladder, had, the"
There are a couple of opportunities for algebraic simplifications.
"So, we can replace the squaring up here, by a multiply."
"And down here we had a multiply by two, which we can replace by a left shift of one."
Next we can observe that we have some copies and constants.
So we have a constant assignment to b and a copy assignment to c And those can be propagated forward to the uses of b and c.
"Once we've done that, we can do constant folding."
"So here, the assignment to e, The opera-, the arguments to the shift are all constants, And so that can be replaced by an assignment, that e gets the value six."
Next we could observe that we have a common sub expression that we could eliminate that both a and d have the value x times x.
So the assignment to d could be replaced by a copy that d now gets the value of a.
Now we have two opportunities again for copying constant propagation the assignment to D and the assignment to E can be propagated forward.
And finally we can do a bunch of dead code elimination.
"So, assuming that, none of these values, B, C, D, or E is used anyplace else in the program, all four of these statements can be deleted."
And this is where we actually get some real performance improvement.
"So here we actually are now saving entire instructions, and that's the best kind of savings that we can have And so we wind up with this as our final form."
So notice that a is assigned the value x*x.
"F is then assigned, the value a+a, And then g is assigned the value six*f."
"Now, this is not quite as fast as it could be, alright?"
There's actually one more algebraic optimization that could be done.
"We can notice here that f is actually=to two*a,"
And then we could do some rearrangement here to discover that g=12*f.
"Sorry, sorry twelve x a."
"Alright, And then this statement assignment to F might become dead code, and we could delete it from the program."
"I think some compilers would actually find this, but I believe that even current state of the art compilers, many of them, would not discover this last rearrangement to the program."
My name's Raquel Ruvalcaba and I work with the Department of Environment and we're recycling oil for o ur community today.
"""Thank you."" When they recycling it we can actually go into a refinery and they c an reuse it again."
"""Aqui no mas."" They do the oil changes themselves anyway, so now they know where to take it back to, and what to do with it."
"""A lot of people don't change their own oil cuz they think it's a headache."
"I do, always have."
"""I change motor oil often."" ""And I don't throw it down the sewers either, like other people used to do."" ome people do."
"""It's safe for the environment and also you can reuse it."" ""So bring it here, and if you have a whole bunch of toxics you want to get rid of just call that number, they'll collect it at your home."" ""It's a waste to throw it all away when you can reuse it again."
"It still has life in it, all i t has is just dirt."
It just needs to be filtered out and it can be used for other products.
So if we multiply this matrix times-- let's call this vector x.
"This is x1, x2, all the way down to xn, what is this going to be equal to?"
So this is vector x right here.
"So if I multiply matrix I, my identity matrix, I sub n, and"
"I multiply it times my vector x, where x is a member of Rn, has n components, what am I going to get?"
"Well, I'm going to get 1 times x1 plus 0 times x2 plus 0 times x3 plus 0 times x4, all of that."
"So essentially, I'm going to have-- you can kind of view it as this row dotted with the vector."
So the only nonzero term is going to be the 1 times the x1.
"So it's going to be x1-- sorry, let me do it like this."
So you're going to get another vector in Rn like that.
"And so the first term is that row essentially being dotted with that column, and so you just get x1."
"And then the next entry is going to be this row, or you could view it as the transpose of this row dotted with that column, so 0 times x1 plus 1 times x2 plus 0 times everything else."
"So the only nonzero term is the 1 times x2, so you get an x2 there."
"And then you keep doing thatt, and what are you going to get?"
You're going to get an x3 because the only nonzero term here is the third one and you're going to go all the way down until you get an xn.
But what is this thing equal to?
This is just equal to x.
"So the neat thing about this identity matrix that we've created is that when you multiply it times any vector, you got the vector again."
The identity matrix times any vector in Rn-- it's only defined for vectors in Rn-- is equal to that vector again.
"And actually, the columns of the identity matrix have a special-- I guess the set of columns has a special name."
"So if we call this first column e1 and this second column e2 and the third column e3 and we go all the way to en, these vectors, these column vectors here, the set of these-- so let's say e1, e2, all the way to en-- this is called the standard basis for Rn."
So why is it called that?
"Well, the word basis is there, so two things must be true."
These things must span Rn and they must be linearly independent.
It's pretty obvious from inspection they're linearly independent.
"If this guy has a 1 here and no one else has a 1 there, there's no way you can construct that 1 with some combination of the rest of the guys."
And you can make that same argument for each of the ones in each of the components.
So it's clearly linearly independent.
"And then to see that you can span, that you can construct any vector with a linear combination of these guys, you just really have to-- you know, whatever vector you want to construct, if you want to construct x1-- let me put it this way."
If you want to construct this vector-- let me write it this way.
Let me pick a different one.
"Let's say you want to construct the vector a1, a2, a3 all the way down to an."
Now these assumptions are captured in a table I have on my document camera.
"What I have here are five firms, just calling them A,B,C,D, and, and E. Each of these five firms is emitting five units of pollution."
And each has a different call structure in the eliminating or the abating of the units of pollution.
"For example firm A, incurs a cost of $100 dollars. incurs a marginal cost of $100 to eliminate the first unit of pollution."
"Then it incurs $200 for the second, $400 for the third, $800 and $1600 for the fifth."
B. Has a higher cost structure.
"B, incurs $200 in cost to abate the first unit."
"It's $600, $1800, $5400, and, and so on."
I hope you get.
"Now, let's suppose the government comes in and regulates this environment, this geographical location and it tells produces that they can not emit more than two units of pollution."
"Well, that means that each fund is basically given."
"Two rights, two pollute there is a standard equal to the to the stash a line firms must incur the cause of the clean up for all units of pollution prior to this a dash line.Now this means,that firm A must clean up three units which is one hundred plus two hundred plus four hundred which is $700."
"Firm B must incur these three costs or 200+600, that's 800 and $2600."
Firm C incurs these costs which add up to $1200.
"And firm D, that's 2000, $3000."
And firm
"E, well that's $6000 there."
"Firm E is a very high cost pollution abater, cost firm"
E a great deal.
"In this table what I have done is taken, transfered the costs at each firm is going to have to Per, to abate the, the required three units of pollution."
"And the total cost is $13,500."
In contrast to requiring each firm to clean up three units of pollution.
"What the government might do is simply, say that there are ten pollution rights."
"And, firms can bid for these pollution rights."
"In order to emit a unit of pollution, they must bid for these, these rights. say, made, made out in, in tickets or licenses."
"And if they do, we know that, they're going to bid based on their cost structure."
"We go back to our, our table."
"Well lets suppose that the cost of a ticket is only $50, that is the initial price at the auction is only $50."
Well how many units of these pollution rights is A going to want?
"Well A would prefer to pay $50 for a pollution right, then to incur even the, The cost, the low cost of even abating the first unit of pollution, so A is gonna want five tickets, and of course if A wants five tickets at fifty buck, B is gonna want to buy five tickets."
It's cheaper to buy the pollution rates than to incur all of these costs.
"Well, you can imagine that as you go through this table that all five firms are gonna want five tickets."
"Let's say that I place some textbooks on top of this table, or box, just to make the drawing simpler."
Let's say I place a box there.
"Let's say the box weighs 10 kilograms, which would be about 100 Newtons."
So let's say it weighs about 100 Newtons.
"So what I want to figure out, what I need to figure out, is how much weight is being put onto each of the legs of the table?"
"And this might not have even been obviously a moment problem, but you'll see in a second it really is."
So how do we know that?
"Well, both of these legs are supporting the table, right?"
"Whatever the table is exerting downwards, the leg is exerting upwards, so that's the amount of force that each of the legs are holding."
"So what we do is we pick-- so let's just pick this leg, just because I'm picking it arbitrarily."
"Let's pick this leg, and let's pick an arbitrary axis of rotation."
"Well, let's pick this is as our axis of rotation."
Why do I pick that as the axis of rotation?
Because think of it this way.
"If this leg started pushing more than it needed to, the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction."
"Or the other way, if this leg started to weaken and started to buckle and couldn't hold its force, the table would rotate down this way, and it would rotate around the other"
"leg, assuming that the other leg doesn't fail."
We're assuming that this leg is just going to do its job and it's not going to move one way or the other.
"But this leg, that's why we're thinking about it that way."
"If it was too weak, the whole table would rotate in the clockwise direction, and if it was somehow exerting extra force, which we know a leg can't, but let's say if it was a spring or something like that, then the whole table would rotate in the counterclockwise direction."
"So once we set that up, we can actually set this up as a moment problem."
So what is the force of the leg?
"So the whole table is exerting some type of-- if this leg wasn't here, the whole table would have a net clockwise moment, right?"
The whole table would tilt down and fall down like that.
So the leg must be exerting a counterclockwise moment in order to keep it stationary.
So the leg must be exerting a force upward right here.
"The force of the leg, right?"
We know that.
We know that from basic physics.
There's some force coming down here and the leg is doing an equal opposite force upwards.
So what is that force of that leg?
And one thing I should have told you is all of the distances.
It's just part of life.
"It's just your reality at this moment, don't take it personally, as an affront to your arrogant idea of who you think you are."
"When you accept it, you start to undermine it."
"It's a wonderful thing to know that when you're at peace with fear, fear dissipates."
"When you're not angry at anger, the anger just loses its power source, it just dissipates."
"When you're just at peace or accept the grief, the grief doesn't last very long."
It's when we try and control these things and get rid of them that we're actually feeding them.
So we let go of this controller.
"We're kind to our emotions, even our negative emotions."
"So when you have, you know a negative emotion, you're disappointed, you're fed up, look at those emotions like beings in this world, be compassionate to the beings which exist in your mental landscape."
"And we should never be cruel, we should be gentle to ourselves and allow these things to be.."
"Because too often we do violence to our emotional world, and because we do violence to our emotional world, it's against the gentleness of this second factor of the eightfold path."
"Because we do violence to that world - ""I shouldn't be afraid!"
I shouldn't be grieving!
"I shouldn't be angry!"" you can see that that makes more negative emotions for your future."
Basically we call this the Law of Kamma.
The emotions you have now have been generated by what you've done in the past.
But they're there - you can't undo the past.
"You're stuck with this, the results of your past kamma."
"I don't mean past life - I mean what you've been doing today, it's created this moment you're feeling now."
But now what are we going to do about this.
"It's the kamma we do in the moment which is most important and if we face this moment, maybe a moment of grief, it may be a moment of fear, it may be a moment of sadness, a moment of anger, we can face this moment and say ""This is a result of past kamma, what am I doing about this now?"
I'm going to make good kamma with this feeling.
I'm going to let go of trying to control it.
I'm going to be kind to it.
I'm going to be gentle with it.
I'm going to respect it.
Allowing it like every other being in this universe to be - they have a reason to be here.
"I'm going to allow them to be and accept them and be at peace with them."""
"When you can make peace and be kind to the emotions you're experiencing in the moment, a wonderful thing happens - the emotional pain loses its sting, and the tightness of that emotional knot starts to unravel."
"Whether it's a broken heart, or whether it's grief over the loss of a child, when you really let it be, we call it healing."
We call it sort-of fixing up the problem.
Present value for an annuity.
"And remember, annuities, the amount of the annuity when you write could be called C. But when you go to a calculator or a spreadsheet we will call it PMT because that's what it, they call it, right?"
Makes sense.
Okay.
"I would like you to stare at this problem and I know you have the ability to pause and so on, but I'd like to pause with you and what I'm going to do, for every example, and if"
"I don't, you should do this, is I'm going to read out the problem for you and we'll talk about it a little bit."
"And then I would really encourage you to try to do the problem, I'll do it with you but I would encourage you to kind of think actively and be participating in it because I can't, you know, I can't see whether you're doing it or not but I hope you do."
"Okay, so what will be the value of your portfolio?"
What is the portfolio?
"Portfolio and, that's a lingo in Finance."
"Portfolio means whatever your investment is, wherever you have put your money."
"So, the word portfolio is used generically because you'll, you'll, you'll see later, it's a hangover from the fact that life has risk."
"And if life has risk and you do not like risk, which most people don't, you tend to not put all your eggs in one basket."
"So, the fact that you hold a basket of different things is called a portfolio."
"Okay, I'm."
"I try to emphasize words which are I take for granted because, you know, I mean, if you're new to Finance, which most of you probably are, you need to understand why certain language is used in, in very commonly."
"At retirement, if you deposit $10,000 every year in a pension fund."
"Now, if you are really young, say, you are fifteen and taking this class which I hope some of you are, don't worry too much about retirement, you know, have some fun."
"You're in high school, you haven't even be gun earning hopefully, just having fun."
"So, but this is something that you will do at some point, most people do."
"So, what I would recommend is just think of it as an intellectual problem but actually it's a very rare problem."
"So, what will be the value pf your portfolio over time and you deposit $10,000 every year in a pension fund?"
What is a pension fund?
"Pension fund is a place or an account which hopefully has multiple assets, if you're risk averse."
"Multiple kinds of investments, a bond, a stock, and we'll talk about those."
"You put $10,000 every year, why 10,000 fixed amount?"
"Well, nothing is forcing you to put 10,000 every year."
"It can be 11,000 one year, 9,000 the other."
"But oddly enough, to make life simple perhaps, many people tend to put away a certain amount of money every year for things they need in the future."
"So, the notion of a pension fund is at some point I'm going to retire and I need some money."
"So, you put away 10,000 every year."
"You plan to retire in about 40 years, and expect to earn eight percent on your portfolio."
I'm going to try and get back out what was front most.
Okay.
"So queue is FlFO, first in first out, and waiting in line, whoever's been in the queue longest is the first one to come out, very fair handling of things."
And so if were to think about this in terms of let's go straight across the
linked list.
We just got our head around the link list with the stack.
Let's see if there's a link list for the queue provide the same kind of easy access to the things we need to do the work.
"So it seems like the two strategies that we looked at for stack are probably the same two to look at for this one, right, which we go in the front ways orders."
I mean the front of the queue accessible in there and reversing our way down to the tail or the other way around.
Right.
"I mean, the tail of the queue up here in the front"
leading the way to the head of the queue.
"So this is head - I'll call it front of queue, and this is back, this is the back and that's the front."
Okay.
So that will be GA that will be GB.
"But first off, ask yourself, where does the queue do its work?"
Does it do it at the front or does it do it at the back?
It does it at both.
"But when you're end queuing, right, you're manipulating the back of the queue, adding something to the tail end of the line."
"When you are de queuing, you're adding something to the front of the queue."
"So like unlike the stack where both the actions were happening in the same place, and that kind of unified your thinking about where to allow for that, you know, easy access to the top, the one thing the stack cared about, but the bottom of the stack, right, was, you know, buried and it didn't matter."
The queue actually needs accesses to both.
"So that sort of sounds like that both these strategies, right, have the potential to be trouble for us."
"Because it's like in the link list form, right, you know the idea that access to the head is easy, access to the tail that is a little bit more tricky."
"Now, I said we could add a tail pointer."
"And maybe that's actually going to be part of the answer to this, right, but as it is, with no head pointers in here, that adding an item to A would involve traversing that queue to find the end to put a new one on."
"Similarly, if indeed, the inverse operation is going to be our trouble, which is de queuing, we have to kind of walk its way down to find the last element in the link list ordering, which is [inaudible] queue."
So what say we add a tail pointer in both cases?
"So we have a head that points to here and a tail that points to there, it's"
like that will make our problem a little bit easier to deal with.
So
let me look at B first.
"So the new path is just the SVW Path, okay?"
So [inaudible] we computed the shortest path from S to W in this graph.
So now we proceed to the final iteration of Dijkstra's algorithm.
We know what vertex we're going to bring into X. It's gonna be the vertex T. That's the only one left.
But we still have to compute by which edge we discover T and bring it into the set X. So we have to compute the [inaudible] score for each of the two crossing arcs...
VT and WT.
"And in this final iteration the score for the arc (V, T) is unchanged."
"So this is still gonna be the a value of its tail, one, plus the length of the arc, six."
So the score here is still seven.
"And now, for the first time, WT is a crossing edge of the frontier, and when we compute its score, it's the a value of its tail W, which is three, plus the length of this arc, which is three, so we get a rescore of six."
"So by Dijkstra's greedy criterion, we pick the edge wt instead of the edge VT, and of course, that doesn't matter who gets brought into X, but it does matter how we compute the A and B values for T."
So in the final iration.
"We compute AT to be the Dijkstra greedy score of the edge that we picked, which is the edge, WT and the score was six."
So we compute the shortest path distance from S to T to be six.
And then what is the path itself?
"Well, we inherit the shortest path from the tail of the arc that we used to discover T. So that's the shortest path to W, which we previously computes as being the path through V. And then we append the edge we used to discover T, so we append the edge, WT."
"So the shortest path from S to T, we're going to compute as the zig-zag path."
"S. Goes to V, goes to T, Sorry, Goes to W, goes to T. And then now indeed X is all the vertices."
We've computed it for everything.
This is our final output.
"The contents of the, especially the A array, this, the final output."
Shortest path distances from S to all of the four possible destinations.
"And if you go back and compare this to the example you went through to the quiz, you will see at least on this example, indeed."
"Dijkstra's algorithm corrects pa, the shortest path distances."
"Now, I've said it before and I'll say it again."
"If someone shows you their algorithm works just on some example, especia lly a pretty simple four note example, you should not jump to the conclusion that this algorithm always works."
"Sometimes the algorithms work fine on small examples, but break down once you go to more interesting complicated examples."
"So I definitely owe you a proof that Dijkstra's algorithm works not only in this network, but in any network."
"And actually, it doesn't work in any network."
It's only gonna work in any network with non-negative edge lengths.
"So to help you appreciate that, Let's conclude this video with a nonexample showing what goes wrong in Dijkstra's algorithm when you have networks with negative edge lengths."
"So before I actually give you a, a real non example let me just answer preliminary question which you might have and should be have very good question if it something that's occurred to you."
"Let's explore our second strategy for graph search, namely depth-first search."
"And again, like with breadth-first search, I'll open by just reminding you what the depth-first search is good for."
And we'll trace through it in a particular example and then we'll tell you what the actual code is.
"So if breath first search is the cautious and tentative exploration strategy, then depth first search or DFS for short is its more aggressive cousin."
So the plan is to explore aggressively and only backtrack when necessary.
And this is very much the strategy one often uses when trying to solve a maze.
"To explain what I mean, let me show you how this would work in the same running example we used when we discussed breath first search."
So here if we invoke depth first search from the node number S.
"Here's what's gonna happen, so obviously we start at S and obviously there's two places where we can go next."
"We can go to A or, or to B, and depth-first search is underdetermined like breath-first search, we can pick either one."
"So like with the breath-first search example, let's go to A first."
So A will be the second one that we explore.
"But now unlike breadth-first search where we automatically went to node B next, since that was the other layer one node, here the only rule is that we have to go next to one of A's immediate neighbors."
"So we might go to B but we're not going to B because it's one of the neighbors of S, we go because it's one of the neighbors of A, and actually to make sure the difference is clear, let's assume that we aggressively pursue deeper and we go from A to C. And now the depth-first search strategy is, again, just to pursue deeper."
"So, you go to one of C's immediate neighbors."
"So, maybe we go to E next."
"So, E is going to be the fourth one visited."
"Now, from E there's only one neighbor, not counting the one that we came in on."
"So, from E we go to D. And D is the fifth one we see, now from D we have a choice, we can either go to B or we can go to C. So let's suppose we go to C from D. Well then we get to a node number three, where we've been before, okay?"
And as usual we're going to keep track of where we've already been.
"So at this point we have to backtrack from C back to D, we retreat to D. Now there's still another outgoing edge from D to explore, namely the one to B. And so what happens is, we actually wind up wrapping all the way around this outer cycle."
And we hit B sixth.
"And now, of course, anywhere we try to explore, we see somewhere we've already been, so from B we try to go to S, but we've been there, so we retreat to B, we try, we can try to go to A, but we've been there, so we retreat to B. Now we've explored all of the options out of B. So we have to retreat from B, we have to go back to D. Now from"
"D we've explored both B and C, so we have to retreat back to E. E we've explored the only outgoing mark D, so we have to retreat to C. C we retreat to A. From A, we actually haven't yet looked along this arc."
But that just sends to B where we've been before.
"So then we retreat back to A. Finally, we retreat back to S and S, even at S there's still an extra edge to explore."
"At S we say, oh we haven't tried this S-B edge yet but, of course, when we look across, we get to B where we've been before and then we backtrack to S. Then we've looked at every edge once and so we stop."
That's how depth-first search works.
You just pursue your path.
You go to an immediate neighbor as long as you can until you hit somewhere you've been before and then you retreat.
"Now, why do we need another search strategy?"
Breadth first search was pretty cool.
And initially X is going to be just the source vertex itself.
So now we enter them in while loop.
"And so remember, in the while loop, we say, well, let's scan all of the edges whose tail is in the vertices we've already looked at."
"Whose tail is in X, and whose head is outside of X. Now in this first iteration, there are two such edges."
"There's the edge SV, and the edge SW."
So how do we know which of these two to use.
Well we evaluate Dijkstra's greedy criterion.
You guys remember what that is.
"Dijkstra's greedy score for a given edge VW That's crossing the frontier, is just the previously computed shortest path distance for the A tail of the arc plus the length of the arc itself."
"So at this point SV has a greedy score of zero plus one, which is one, and the arc S comma W has a greedy score of zero plus four, which is four."
"So obviously SV is going to be the shorter of those two, so we use the edge SV, this is playing the role of V star W star on the previous slide, and the algorithm them suggests we should add V to our set X, so we suck in V, and our new X consists of S and V. [sound]."
"And it also tells us how to compute the shortest path distance and the shortest path from S to V, namely in the A array, we just write down what was the greedy, the Dijkstra's greedy score for this particular edge, and that was zero plus one, or one."
"It also tells us how to compute the shortest path for v, namely we just inherit the shortest path to the tail of the arc, which, in this case, was the empty path from S to itself, and then we tack on the end, we append the arc we used to get here, the arc S to V."
So now we go to the next iteration of the while loop.
So with our new set [inaudible] consisting of S and v. Now again we wanna look at all edges which are crossing the fr ontier.
Edges that have tail in X and head outside x.
And know we see there is three such crossing edges.
"There is SW there is VW and there is VT all of those have the tail in X and the head outside of X, so we need to compute"
"Dijkstra's greedy score for each of those three and then pick the minimum, so let's go from bottom to top, so first of all we can look at the arc SVSW, excuse me."
"And the greedy score here is the shortest path distance for the tail, so it's zero, plus the length of the arc, which is four."
So here we get a four in this iteration.
"Then, if we do this crossbar edge, this VW edge, the Dijkstra greedy score is the a value, or the shortest path distance value of the tail, and we computed that last iteration."
The a of V value is one.
"We add to that the length of the arc, which in this case is two."
"So this edge three, [inaudible] this edge VW has a score of three."
"Finally there's the arc VT, and here, we're gonna add one, which is the shortest path distance of the tail of the arc, plus the edge length which is six."
So that has the worst score.
"So since the edge VW has the smallest score, that's the one that guides how we supplement X, and how we compute the shortest path distances in the shortest path for the newly acquired vertex W. So the changes are, first of all, we enlarge X. So X is now everything but T. And then how do we compute things for W?"
"Well the shortest path, so our entry in A array is just going to be Dijkstra's [inaudible] greedy score in the previous set of rations so that was one plus two so that's going to be equal to three."
"And then what is the shortest path, how do we fill up the array B?"
Well we inherit the shortest path to the tail of the arc.
Which in this case is the arc SV and then we append the arc that we used to choose this new vertex W so that's the arc VW.

Pygmy peoples
"Pygmy is a word that describes several ethnic groups with unusually short people. According to anthropologists, pygmies can be any group where adult men are less than tall on average. The best known pygmies are the Aka, Efé and Mbuti of central Africa. There are also pygmies in Australia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil. The Negritos of Southeast Asia are also called pygmies."
"The word ""pygmy"" is sometimes thought to be pejorative (an insult). It is, however, the only word that is used to call ""all"" African Midgets."
"The word Bayaka is sometimes used in the Central African Republic to refer to all local Pygmies. In the Congo Basin, pygmies are called the Kongo word Bambenga."
Name.
"The name ""pygmy"" comes from the Greek word (""pygmaios""). This word was derived from (came from) the word which is the length between a person's elbow and knuckles. The Latin word (pl. ""pygmaei"") came from this older Greek word."
"The word was first used in Greek mythology by the poet Homer. He wrote about a tribe of dwarfs called ""Pygmies"" who lived in India and Ethiopia."
Origins.
"There are a number of theories to explain why pygmies are so short. It has been proved that their height is hereditary, and is passed on from parents to children. It may have evolved because of the low ultraviolet light found in rainforests, where many pygmies live. This would mean that the pygmies would make less vitamin D in their skin. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, which is important for bones to grow. Since the pygmies would get less calcium, they would have smaller bones and skeletons."
There are other explanations for why pygmies are so short. Some explanations are:
Some research shows that the genes for the growth hormone receptor and growth hormone are found much less in pygmies than in related tribes. These genes are important for humans to grow tall.
Africa.
"Pygmies can be found in Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zambia. Most of these groups are partly hunter-gatherers. They get food from the environment and trade it with nearby farmers. From the farmers they get crops and tools. There are about 250,000-600,000 Pygmies living in the Congo rainforest."
"While designing clothes inspired by ""Alice in Wonderland"" for her Abbey Dawn line, Lavigne told Disney executives she could write a song for the film's soundtrack.

Flag of Utah
The Flag of the State of Utah was adopted in 1913 and has the Seal of Utah encircled in a golden circle on a background of dark navy blue.
"In 1912, the Sons and Daughters of Utah Pioneers ordered a custom made copy of the newly adopted state flag to be showed off to the battleship USS Utah, which was commissioned on August 31, 1911. When the flag came, the group found out that the coat of arms on the flag was in full color instead of white, and the manufacturer had added a gold ring around the shield. Rather than have the flag remade, the Utah legislature changed the law to match the battleship flag, and the flag was showed off to the USS Utah."
"A bald eagle, the national bird of the United States represents the safety of America. The arrows in the talons of the eagle represent courage in war. The sego lily, the Utah state flower, represents peace. The state motto ""industry"" represents progress, hard work, and community as does the emblem of the beehive, which is also a traditional Mormon symbol. Crossed Union flags show Utah's support and commitment to the United States. The name, Utah, appears underneath the beehive. The date 1847 represents the year Brigham Young led the first Mormons into the state. The year listed below that, 1896, represents the year that Utah was admitted to the Union. The gold circle around the state seal represents eternal order. The shield underneath the bald eagle represents common defense (military)."
"The design of the seal was adopted in 1850 by the Territory of Utah and changed by the artist ""Harry Edwards"" when Utah became a state in 1896."

MAC address
"Computers that use a computer network or internet network need to be identified. For this reason, many network connection types, like Ethernet or Wi-Fi, use unique addresses to identify the network card, a part of a computer, to access the network. These addresses are usually called the Media Access Control address or MAC address."
"Each computer is given a MAC address by its computer maker. The way for giving MAC addresses to computers, created by Xerox, is used. MAC addresses have 48-bits (how many 1s or 0s it has in it). As each of the twelve entries can have 16 possible values (0 through 9 and A through F), there are 1612 or 248 (or 281,474,976,710,656) possible MAC addresses. MAC addresses identify many things, such as the type of device being used."
A MAC address is used by the network to send and receive data (computer information) to the right place almost like mail being sent and received from a home mail address. The MAC address is like door number or street number.

Anna Freud
Anna Freud (3 December 1895 – 9 October 1982) was the sixth and last child of Sigmund Freud and his wife Martha Bernays Freud.
She was born in Vienna. She followed the path of her father and contributed to the field of psychoanalysis.
"With Melanie Klein, she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology. As her father put it, child analysis had received a powerful impetus through ""the work of Frau Melanie Klein and of my daughter, Anna Freud"". Her work emphasized the importance of the ego and its ability to be trained socially."
Key moments in life.
"After a somewhat troubled childhood, Anna was psychoanalysed by her father. When her analysis was completed in 1922, she became a psychoanalyist herself. She taught at the Vienna Psychoanalytic Training Institute on the technique of child analysis. From 1925 until 1934, she was the Secretary of the International Psychoanalytical Association. She continued child analysis and seminars and conferences on the subject."
"After the Anschluss in 1938 the Freuds fled Vienna and came to London. Freud himself was dying of cancer, so Anna ran the household. Anna had a professional disagreement with Melanie Klein, who had come to London much earlier, and was already established as a child psychologist. A series of 'controversial discussions' were held by the British Psychoanalytical Society. The discussions were about the training and the ideas of both parties. Eventually agreement was reached that both 'schools' should co-exist inside the Society. The Society now has three training divisions: Kleinian, Freudian and Independent."
"During the war, Freud studied the effect of deprivation of parental care on children. She set up a centre for young war victims, called ""The Hampstead War Nursery"". Here the children got foster care, with mothers"
encouraged to visit as often as possible.
"In 1947, Freud and Kate Friedlaender established the Hampstead Child Therapy Courses. Five years later, a children's clinic was added. Freud started lecturing on child psychology."
"From the 1950s until the end of her life Freud travelled regularly to the United States to lecture, teach and visit friends. During the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children. At Yale Law School, she taught seminars on crime and the family."
Freud died in London on 9 October 1982. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and her ashes placed in a marble shelf next to her parents' ancient Greek funeral urn. Her lifelong friend Dorothy Burlingham and several other members of the Freud family also rest there.
Personal life.

Album artwork.
"According to Vic Fuentes, ""the theme to the album artwork is 'jumping off of the ground that is breaking beneath you'. The idea is to inspire hope amongst the chaos that may be happening around you. If the ground was breaking beneath your feet, your first reaction may be to run and jump to safety, and it's that moment where you are suspended in the air that I am focusing on. A still frame where you're not sure if the person is falling or flying. It's about freeing yourself from the things that are breaking or falling apart in your life, and inspiring a sense of hope from the desperation""."

"The album has been received rather well by critics. Alternative Press rated the album 4/5 stars saying ""Collide with the Sky is PTV's best work to date"".

Early life.
Backpacking (wilderness)
"Backpacking is hiking in the outdoors with a backpack full of all your food, clothing, water, and shelter. Usually, backpackers hike in groups to stay safer. They must think to bring first aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, food and other camping supplies."
"Backpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared."
"When following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all waste and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world."

Places of interest.
Some interesting places in Mâcon are:
"It also has been known as both a classic and a masterpiece, and has received a Special Edition 60th Anniversary Disney DVD on October 23, 2001, exatly 60 years after its first release. That release featured a sneak peek of a direct-to-video sequel called Dumbo II. The preview showed a lot of sketches and storyboard ideas. The main story has to do with Dumbo and his new friends getting separated from the rest of the circus as they wonder into the big city. Dumbo's new friends are Claude and Lolly the twin bears who leave chaos everywhere they go, Dot the curious zebra, Godfrey the hippo who is older and wants to do things for himself, and Penny the adventurous ostrich. Timothy returns as well. The story was supposed to be as if the first Dumbo ended and this one started the next day. The project seems to have been canceled,as no further announcements have been made since, plus the fact that The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning, Tinker Bell, and its sequels, were to be the last projests for DisneyToon Studios."
The crow characters in the movie are often seen as African-American stereotypes.
"The leader crow voiced by Cliff Edwards was originally named ""Jim Crow"" for script purposes. The other crows are all voiced by African-American actors and singers, all members of the Hall Johnson Choir: Nick Stewart, James Baskett, Jim Carmichael and Hall Johnson. The late famous duo of African-American dancers Freddie and Eugene Jackson were invited and hired by Disney to work as live-action reference and models for the animators of the characters, like the chief-animator and Disney Legend Ward Kimball, improvising dances and movements then used in the iconic musical sequence ""When I See An Elephant Fly"". Despite suggestions of racism by writers like Richard Schickel, many historians, critics, writers, pundits and personalities such as John Grant, Leonard Maltin, John Canemaker, Floyd Norman, Eric Goldberg, Alex Wainer, Michael Wilmington, Whoopi Goldberg and Neal Gabler reject these claims. For instance, the crows are noted as forming the majority of the characters in the movie who are empathetic and sympathetic to Dumbo's plight (the others are Timothy Q. Mouse and Mrs Jumbo), they are free spirits who serve nobody, and intelligent characters aware of the power of self-confidence and of what means being ostracized and marginalized, unlike the Stepin Fetchit stereotype common at that time and in the previous decade. Furthermore, their song ""When I See An Elephant Fly"" is more orientated to mocking Timothy Mouse than Dumbo's large ears."
Media and marketing.
Dumbo's Circus.
"""Dumbo's Circus"" was a live-action puppet television programme for preschool audiences that aired on The Disney Channel in the 1980s. Unlike in the movie, Dumbo spoke on the show. Each character would perform a special act, which ranged from dancing and singing to telling knock knock jokes."
Theme parks.
"Dumbo the Flying Elephant is a popular ride that appears in Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, Disneyland, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park (Paris), and Hong Kong Disneyland."
Video games.
"Dumbo appears as a hero in the game Kingdom Hearts. Sora, the main character, flies on him and Dumbo splashes enemies with water from his trunk."
Bertolt Brecht
(born ;* 10. February 1898 in Augsburg; † 14. August 1956 in Berlin) was a German poet and dramatist.
Life.
"Brecht went to school in Augsburg, where his father was the director of a paper factory."
He completed his degree in 1917.
"Afterwards he studied sciences, medicine and literature at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich. He had to take a break in his studies because he had to join the army."
"In the 1920s, Brecht went to Berlin and became a part of the cultural scene. He met his second wife Helene Weigel in Berlin and married her, after divorcing his first wife. It was with his second wife that Brecht had another son."
In Berlin he met a lot of artists and intellectuals of the Weimar Republic.
"His works became very critical about the capitalistic society (e.g. ""Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny"" (1930)). Many of his friends were communists, but he never joined the KPD."
"His most famous work was from that time, the ""Dreigroschenoper""."
In 1933 the Nazis prohibited playing some of his works and arrested some of his friends.
"After the Reichstag fire, he travelled from Germany to Prague, Vienna, Switzerland and Denmark."
"For the next five years he lived in Denmark. In 1938 he wrote ""Das Leben des Galilei"" (The Life of Galilei) about Galileo Galilei, who was hunted by the Holy Inquisition because he wanted to tell the scientific truth."
When Germany occupied Denmark he had to flee once again.
"He went to Sweden, then to Finland and finally to Moscow in the Soviet Union."
Even under Stalin he was not safe. He therefore flew through China to the United States.
He lived and worked in California and translated a lot of text.
"In 1947, in the McCarthy era, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigated him, because they suspected him of being a communist."
He gave a statement and said that he had never been a member of the communist party.
He then flew back to Switzerland - the only place he could go to at the time.
"In 1948 he was allowed to return to Berlin, East Berlin."
Outstation (Aboriginal community)
"In Australia, the outstation movement is the movement of Australian Aboriginal people from large towns to much smaller communities, called outstations. It is mostly seen in the Northern Territory and amongst the people of the Western Desert."
"Before the 20th century, most Aboriginal families lived by themselves or in groups of 20–30 people. They were nomadic (moving from place to place), hunting and foraging across the deserts. As Euro-Australians started to build roads, towns and farms on Aboriginal lands, the native people were forced out. They had to move off their lands into towns or missions. There, the government would give them food, water and clothes."
"This way of life did not suit them. In the towns, there were many conflicts between different ethnic groups, people became addicted to alcohol, and many of them died from foreign diseases. Many groups were also far away from their traditional homelands, which were important to them and their spirituality. From the 1970s, many families started to move away from the towns. They returned to the places they grew up, and set up smaller communities."
"One of the main reasons behind the movement is for Aboriginal people to get back autonomy and self-sufficiency. The communities manage themselves, as nomadic groups (or ""tribe"") did many years before. Hunting and foraging – getting their own food, and food for everybody – is still important."
Santa Catalina rattlesnake
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake (""Crotalus catalinensis""), also known as the """"Santa Catalina Island Rattlesnake"", is a species of venomous Pit viper found only on Santa Catalina Island in the Gulf of California. There are currently no subspecies recognized."
Description.
"The Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is a small and slender species of rattlesnake. It can grow up to the length of 73.1 centimeters (28.8 in), and is known for being one of the few rattlesnakes which don't have a rattle on the end of their tail. Some Santa Catalina Rattlesnakes are light cream in color with reddish-brown blotches down their back, while some are ash gray with dark gray blotches on them."
Behavior.
"While other rattlesnakes of the genus ""Crotalus"""" are mainly terrestrial (live on land), the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's small size makes it very good climber. In July, the hottest month on Santa Catalina Island, the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake is found on branches of bushes and trees so they can escape the heat on the ground."
Feeding.
"Since the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake lives mainly in trees, scientist first thought this rattlesnake eats birds, but scientist have now found out that around 70% of the Santa Catalina Rattlesnake's diet is made up of small mammals like the Santa Catalina Deer Mouse, and around 30% is made up of lizards like the Santa Catalina Desert Iguana and the Santa Catalina Side-blotched lizard."
Claire McCaskill
"Claire Conner McCaskill (born July 24, 1953) is an American politician. She was the United States Senator from Missouri from 2007 to 2019. She is a member of the U.S. Democratic Party. She was the first woman from Missouri elected to the United States Senate. Before being elected to United States Senate McCaskill was the Missouri State Auditor from 1999 to 2007. She was born in Rolla, and she went to school at the University of Missouri."
McCaskill lost to Josh Hawley by nearly 9% in her re-election bid in 2018.
Arlene Dahl
"Arlene Carol Dahl (August 11, 1925 – November 29, 2021) was an American actress. She was a former MGM contract star. Dahl became famous in the 1950s. She was born in Minneapolis and starred in many movies. She was the mother of actor Lorenzo Lamas."
"Dahl died on November 29, 2021 at her home in New York City, aged 96."
Didache
"The Didache (pronounced """"did"" ah kay"") or The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles is an early Christian hand book. It was written in the first or early second century AD."
"It gives information about Christian ethics, rituals such as baptism and Eucharist, and Church organization."
Youth Riding a Rooster (Epiktetos)
Youth Riding a Rooster is a red-figure plate painted by Epiktetos about 520–510 BC. Its diameter measures 7 3/8 in. (18.7 cm). The plate is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It shows a boy riding a rooster. It was a rare subject among ancient artists. It probably references homosexual relations between older men and youths. It also references the practice among Greek males of giving a rooster as a love gift.
"The vase scholar Sir John Beazley wrote in 1918 in ""Attic Red-Figured Vases in American Museums"" (p. 18): ""The best of [Epiktetos] is in his plates. You cannot draw better, you can only draw differently. Epiktetos' people are all lightness and fairy grace, as if they belonged to a world where passion and pain were unknown, to those 'woods of Athens' where Oberon reigned in the days before 'the middle summer's spring'""."
"The plate was discovered in Vulci in 1828. Twenty years later it became the possession of the second marquess of Northampton. On July 2, 1980, his great-great-grandson, the seventh marquess, sold it with other pottery at Christie's in London."
"""Funeral Oration"" was recorded by Thucydides in book two of his ""History of the Peloponnesian War"". Thucydides records the speech as if every word in the record was what Pericles said. However, people agree he did, at least, correct or change the speeches a little. Thucydides says in his ""History"" that the speeches are not completely the same as what was really said, but written to show the main ideas of what was said. It is quite certain that Pericles delivered a speech at the end of the first year of the war. However, people are not sure how much Thucydides' record is the same as Pericles' actual speech."
"The Funeral Oration is important because the speech was different from usual Athenian funeral speeches. David Cartwright describes it as ""a eulogy (description) of Athens itself..."". The speech is about what great things Athens did, delivered to encourage the people."
Gettysburg Address and Pericles' funeral oration.
American Civil War scholar Garry Wills calls Abraham Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address the modern parallel to Pericles' Funeral Oration.
Gorgoneion
"In Ancient Greece, the Gorgoneion () was originally a magic pendant showing the Gorgon's head. (The use of magic against evil, or bad luck is generally called Apotropaism)."
"The gorgoneion was linked with the gods Zeus and Athena; both are said to have worn it as a pendant. It was also popular as a royal symbol, worn on shields and capes. These can be seen on the Alexander Mosaic and the Gonzaga Cameo."
Evolution.
"Homer wrote about the Gorgon on four occasions, but only about the head, as if the creature had no body. Jane Ellen Harrison notes that ""Medusa is a head and nothing more...a mask."" The body was added many years later. Up to the 5th century BC, the head was shown as being very ugly, with her tongue sticking out, boar tusks, puffy cheeks, her eyeballs staring straight ahead and the snakes twisting all around her."
"The direct frontal stare was highly unusual in ancient Greek art. In some cases a beard, (probably representing streaks of blood) was added to her chin, making her appear as a wild and sexual god, like Dionysus."
"Gorgoneia painted on the shields of warriors on mid-5th century Greek vases are not as ugly, strange or frightening. By that time, the Gorgon had lost her tusks and the snakes were rather stylized. The Hellenistic marble known as the Medusa Rondanini shows how the Gorgon changed over time into a beautiful woman."
Usage.
"Gorgoneia are first seen in Greek art at the beginning of the 8th century BC. One of the earliest is on a coin found during an archaeological dig at Parium. Other early 8th-century examples were found at Tiryns. There is a similar image from the Knossos palace, dating from the 15th century BC. Marija Gimbutas even argues that ""the Gorgon extends back to at least 6000 BC, as a ceramic mask from the Sesklo culture illustrates""."
"In the 6th century BC, gorgoneia of a basic type of ""lion mask"" were found all over Greek temples, especially in and around Corinth. Pedimental gorgoneia were common in Sicily; probably the earliest one is in the Temple of Apollo in Syracuse. Around 500 BC, they stopped being used to decorate monumental buildings, but were still shown on parts of the roof tiles (antefix) of smaller buildings throughout the next century."
"As well as temples, the Gorgon image can be found on dress, dishes, weapons, and coins across the Mediterranean region from Etruria to the Black Sea coast. The Gorgon coins were made in 37 cities, making her image on coins second only to some of the main Greek gods. On mosaic floors, the gorgoneion was usually near the door, as if guarding it. On Attic kilns, a gorgoneion over the kiln door protected from accidents."
"The Gorgon image remained popular even in Christian times, especially in the Byzantine Empire, including Kievan Rus (now the Ukraine). The image was used in Western Europe by the Italian Renaissance artists. In the 20th century, the gorgoneion was used by Gianni Versace as a logo for his fashion company."
Origin.
"Gimbutas says the gorgoneia are part of the Mother Goddess cult linked to ""dynamic life energy"". She said the gorgoneion is a typical European image. Jane Ellen Harrison, on the other hand, claims that many primitive cultures use similar ritual masks. These are meant to scare the owner from doing something wrong, or, as she terms it, to make an ugly face at him."

"A co-factor (or cofactor) is a chemical compound which is not a protein, but is attached to a protein. The compound is needed for the protein's biological activity. In most cases, the protein will be an enzyme, and the cofactor will help the enzyme work. If so, the cofactors are also called coenzymes."
"Cofactors which are complex organic molecules are often called coenzymes. If connected by a covalent bond they are a ""prosthetic group"". But if they are just temporarily connected then the cofactor is a ""cosubstrate""."
"Some enzymes need several cofactors. Organic cofactors are often vitamins, or made from vitamins. Metallic ions are often cofactors, but many cofactors have both inorganic and organic parts."
Connective tissue
"Connective tissue is a fibrous tissue. It is one of the four traditional classes of tissues (the others being epithelial, muscle, and nervous tissue)."
"Connective tissue (CT) is found throughout the body. It has 3 main components; cells, fibres, and extracellular matrix."
"Connective tissue makes up a variety of physical structures including, tendons, blood, cartilage, bone, adipose tissue, and lymphatic tissue. CT is classified into three subtypes: embryonic CT, proper CT, and special CT."
"Collagen is the main protein of connective tissue in animals and the most abundant protein in mammals, making up about 25% of the total protein content."
Collagen
"Collagen is a group of naturally occurring proteins. In nature, it is found exclusively in animals, especially in the flesh and connective tissues of mammals."
"It is the main component of connective tissue, and is the most abundant protein in mammals. It makes up about 25% to 35% of the whole-body protein content."
"Collagen, in the form of elongated fibrils, is mostly found in fibrous tissues such as tendon, ligament and skin, and is also abundant in cornea, cartilage, bone, blood vessels, the gut, and intervertebral discs."
"Collagen makes up 1% to 2% of muscle tissue, and accounts for 6% of the weight of strong, tendinous muscles."
"Gelatin, which is used in the food industry, is collagen that has been irreversibly hydrolyzed."
Hurricane Ginger
"Hurricane Ginger is the second longest-lasting Atlantic hurricane on record. It started September 6, 1971 and lasted until October 5. The storm struck eastern North Carolina on September 30, causing $10 million in damage. Peak winds were 110 miles per hour during Ginger's life."

Punishment
"Punishment is when something is done to a person (or animal) that they do not like. It may be because they broke a rule. There are many kinds of punishment, from a death penalty for very bad crimes, to things that parents may do to punish children, like spanking them or taking away their toys. People are often sent to prison as punishment for a crime."
Punishment can be seen as good in society to prevent people from doing bad things. It can also be seen as cruel and unnecessary. It can also be seen to do more harm than good.

Blue whale
"The blue whale (""Balaenoptera musculus"") is a marine mammal of the suborder of baleen whales (called Mysticeti). They grow to be about 30 meters long. The biggest blue whale found was 190 tons and measured 98 feet long. Larger specimens have been measured at 110 feet, but never weighed. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs."
"The blue whale eats mostly very tiny creatures, like krill. These inch-long, shrimp-like crustacean swim in swarms. In the Antarctic summer, there are so many of these krill that they turn the waters orange. A blue whale can eat eight to ten tons of krill every day."
"The blue whale's body is long and slender. It can be various shades of bluish-grey above and somewhat lighter underneath. There are at least three distinct subspecies: ""B. m. musculus"" of the North Atlantic and North Pacific, ""B. m. intermedia"" of the Southern Ocean and ""B. m. brevicauda"" (also known as the pygmy blue whale) found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean. ""B. m. indica"", found in the Indian Ocean, may be another subspecies. As with other baleen whales, its diet consists almost exclusively of small krill."
"Blue whales were once abundant around the world. In the nineteenth century, they were hunted almost to extinction by whalers. They were finally protected by the international community in 1966. A 2002 report estimated there were 5,000 to 12,000 blue whales worldwide, located in at least five groups. More recent research into the Pygmy subspecies suggests this may be an underestimate. Before whaling, the largest population was in the Antarctic, numbering approximately 239,000 (range 202,000 to 311,000). There remain only much smaller (around 2,000) concentrations in each of the eastern North Pacific, Antarctic, and Indian Ocean groups. There are two more groups in the North Atlantic, and at least two in the Southern Hemisphere. The North Atlantic group of Blue Whales can be seen in the Saguenay-St. Lawrence Marine Park near Tadoussac QC, Canada."
Cetacea
"The order Cetacea are marine mammals that live in oceans, seas and even a few rivers around the world. Whales, dolphins and porpoises are part of this group. These common names refer to size: whales are the largest, porpoises the smallest. How and what they eat is a better guide to their relationships. The study of cetaceans is called cetology."
"Cetaceans are ocean creatures without toes, but are classified in the related order Cetartiodactyla because their ancestors were even toed ungulates."
Scottish Gaelic language
"Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig, pronounced ""Gah-lick"") is a Celtic language. It is commonly called just Scots Gaelic in Scottish English. It is a sister language of Irish Gaelic and Manx Gaelic; all three are Goidelic languages. These are related to the Welsh language, Cornish language and the Breton language (these three are Brittonic or Brythonic languages)."
History.
"In past times, the Scottish Gaelic was spoken across all of Scotland except for the Northern Islands (Orkney and Shetland). In the later part of the Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland began to speak Scottish English and looked down on the Scottish Gaelic. After the union of England and Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic was snubbed and looked down on even more, and Scottish English took over."
Today.
"Scottish Gaelic today is basically spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Scottish Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group, but there is some regional variation."
"A census in the United Kingdom in 2001 showed that a total of 58,652 (1.2% of the Scottish population aged over three years old) in Scotland could then speak some amount of Scottish Gaelic. Only the Western Isles have more people who can speak the Scottish Gaelic than not (61% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic). The place in Scotland with the largest percentage of speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis, where, 74.7% of the people there speak Scottish Gaelic."
"Children in Scotland do not have to learn Scottish Gaelic in schools, but it is becoming a more popular subject as Scottish Gaelic is an important part of their Scottish culture."
"Scottish Gaelic is also used overseas. It is estimated that 1,000–2,000 in Nova Scotia, Canada, can speak some Scottish Gaelic."
Scottish language
Scottish language can mean:
West Germanic languages
"The West Germanic Languages are a branch of Germanic languages first spoken in Central Europe and the British Isles. The branch has three parts: the North Sea Germanic languages, the Weser-Rhine Germanic languages, and the Elbe Germanic languages. The most spoken languages in the branch are English, German, and Dutch."
Description.
"Both the largest viper, and the smallest viper in the world belong in this group. The largest viper, the Gaboon Viper, grows up to the length of 2 meters, while the smallest viper, the Namaqua Dwarf Adder, grows up to the length of only 28 cm. All African Adders have wide, triangular heads, a large, rounded snout, and small eyes."
Where they live.
"The African Adders are found in Africa, and the southern Arabian Peninsula."
Behavior.
"African Adders are terrestrial (meaning they live and are found on the ground), and ambush their prey. They are slow, and sluggish, but they can bite their prey or enemy with amazing speed. African Adders are known for when being disturbed inflating their body, and hissing loudly. All African Adders are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. They eat small rodents like mice and rats, birds, amphibians like frogs and toads, other snakes"
Computer-generated imagery
"Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is using computer graphics, especially in movies. These images are used for special effects, simulation, and commercials, amongst others. Sometimes the technology is used to produce a static background, which is then merged into the image; at other times it is used to produce animations in 2D or 3D. In its broadest sense, a computer- generated image (CGI) can be defined as any image that is created with the use of a computer- based processor or program. Because computers are widely used, both in image generating and in image processing, these images are pervasive- from billboard advertisements to film productions and photography."
Benjamin Morrell
"Benjamin Morrell, (July 5, 1795 – 1839) was an American sea captain, navigator and explorer."

Where they live.
"The McMahon's Viper is found in the desert regions of Balochistan, near the borders of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan."
Behavior.
"The McMahon's Viper is said to be nocturnal, but some say it is crepuscular, meaning it is active during the early morning or late evening. It is able to sidewind on loose sand, and sometimes climbs into bushes. It is a aggressive snake, hissing very loudly when disturbed or annoyed, and sometimes it raising its head of the ground and starts striking aggressively. It is able to sink into the sand by moving in a rocking motion. When it sinks into the sand it leaves its eyes and snout sticking out of the sand."

Megaron
"The megaron (, , plural ""megara"") is the rectangular great hall in Mycenaean and ancient Greek palace architecture. The hall was: 1) surrounded by four columns, 2) had an open portico with two columns in the front, and 3) had a central, open hearth venting through an oculus, or opening, in the roof."
"The megaron also had the throne-room of the ""wanax"", or Mycenaean Greek ruler, whose throne was in the main room with the central hearth. Similar architecture is found in the Near East but the open portico supported by columns is particular to the Aegean region. Megara are sometimes called ""long-rooms"" because of their rectangular shape and the position of their entrances. There were often many rooms around the central megaron, such as archive rooms, offices, oil-press rooms, workshops, potteries, shrines, corridors, armories, and rooms storing wine, oil and wheat."
"The megaron was used for sacrifices, royal events, and court meetings."
Structure.
"Halls in the shape of rectangles were a defining theme of Greek architecture. The Mycenaean megaron originated from the ""megaroid"", or large hall-centered rectangular building, of Greece dating back to the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age. Also, it was the architectural forerunner to ancient Greek temples. The megaron's structural layout included a columned entrance, a ""pronaos"", a central ""naos"" (or ""cella""), and one of many roof types (i.e., pitched, flat, barrel). The roof was supported by wooden beams. The floor was made of patterned concrete and covered in carpet. The walls were built with bricks of mud, and were decorated with frescoes. There were metal doors often having two-leaved wood decorations. Footbaths were also used in the megaron as mentioned in Homer's ""Odyssey"" where Odysseus's feet were washed by Eurycleia. The dimensions involving a larger length than width are similar structurally to the early temples of the Dorian Greeks."
Examples.
"A famous megaron is in the king's large reception hall in the Bronze Age palace of Tiryns where the main room had a raised throne placed against the right wall and a central hearth bordered by four Minoan-style wooden columns supporting the roof. The Cretan elements in the megaron of Tiryns were adopted by the Mycenaean Greeks from Minoan palace architecture. Frescoes from Pylos show people eating and drinking, which were important activities in Greek culture. Artistic images of bulls, a common animal motif in Mycenaean vase painting, appear on Greek megaron frescoes such as the one in the Pylos megaron where a bull is shown at the center of a Mycenaean procession. Other famous megara include the ones at the Mycenaean palaces of Thebes and Mycenae. Different Greek cultures had their own megara where, for example, the Greeks of the mainland separated their central megaron from the other rooms whereas the Greeks of Crete did not do this."

"""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"", also sung as ""Buddy, Can You Spare a Dime?"", is one of the best-known American songs of the Great Depression. Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. ""Yip"" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"" was part of the 1932 musical ""New Americana;"" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era."
Summary.
"The song asks why the men who built the nation – built the railroads, built the skyscrapers – who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines."
Musical structure.
"The song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word ""time"" in the line ""Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,"" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger – repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly """"Brother,"" can you spare a dime?"" is replaced with the aggressive """"Buddy,"" can you spare a dime?"""
Update.
"During the bad times in the 1970s, the ""New York Times"" asked Harburg to update ""Brother"" for a new age, and he responded with:"

Autonomic dysreflexia
"Autonomic dysreflexia (AD), also called autonomic hyperreflexia, is a medical emergency."
Who Gets Autonomic Dysreflexia?
"AD usually happens in people with spinal cord injuries that have caused damage above the sixth thoracic vertebra (T6, which is about at the same level of the armpits). However, AD sometimes happens in people with spinal damage as low as their tenth thoracic vertebra (T10, which is about a few inches above the level of the belly button)."
AD can also happen in people with diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).
Symptoms.
Acute AD causes many symptoms. Some are very dangerous. These symptoms include:
What Causes Autonomic Dysreflexia?
Acute AD happens when the involuntary nervous system gets overexcited. The body's fight or flight response kicks in very strongly.
"Scientists think this happens because of afferent nerves. Afferent nerves are supposed to sense things (like touch) and send messages back to the brain and spinal cord so the brain can decide how to react. Scientists think that afferent nerves below the spinal cord injury cause blood pressure to get and stay high, by causing the blood vessels to get smaller. This is part of the fight or flight response."

The required three-quarters of the states ratified the amendment and the Seventeenth Amendment became official on April 8, 1913."
Clauses.
Clause 1.
"The people of the United States are to elect two Senators from each state, for six years. Each Senator will have one vote in the Senate. There are 100 Senators and 100 votes. ""The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures"" means that anyone who can vote in a state election in their state, may also vote for a Senator. In the archaic language of the Constitution this was written in such a way to allow for states having different qualifications for persons eligible to vote for their Senator."
Clause 2.

Clause 3.
"This is a simple addition to prevent the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment from interrupting the election or term of any Senator chosen before the amendment was passed. The United States Senate elections, 1914 were the first nationwide popular elections for Senators."

In this method, two pieces of paper are pasted to each side of the aluminum foil. Many people like origami because there is almost always paper. Copy paper, napkins, wallpaper, index cards, and even paper money can be used to make interesting and unique models."
Tools.
"Many paperfolders prefer to use a flat surface to fold models on, but others, like the Japanese, fold in the air. Traditional paperfolders believe that only the hands should be used when folding, but many modern folders use other tools when folding. Tweezers and paper clips can be used to make very small folds. Some folders use rulers or other flat tools to make sharper creases in the models."
Types.
New types of origami have been made because more people are making origami models.
Pureland.

Polyhedron
"A polyhedron (one polyhedron, many ""polyhedra"", or ""polyhedrons"") is a geometrical shape. It is a 3D shape with flat faces, and straight edges. Each face is a polygon surrounded by edges. Usually it is defined by the number of faces, or edges."
Two types of polyhedron are convex and concave. The line connecting any two points of a convex polyhedron is inside the polyhedron. The line connecting two points of a concave polyhedron may go outside the polyhedron.
"Mathematicians do not agree on what makes a polyhedron. They do agree that there are five Platonic solids, which are regular polyhedra. On a regular polyhedron, all faces are the same and all vertices are the same."
Naming.
"Usually, polyhedra are named by the number of faces they have. The first polyhedra are the tetrahedron, which is made of four triangles, pentahedron (five faces, can look like a four-sided pyramid), hexahedron (six faces, a cube if it is regular), heptahedron (seven faces) and octahedron (eight faces). Prisms, pyramids and other shapes can also be named according to how many faces they have."
Pentagon
"A pentagon is a polygon with five edges. It is defined by five points, which are all on a plane. If all the edges have the same length and the angles at the corners are all 108°, the pentagon is called ""regular"". If the pentagon intersects itself, it is called a pentagram."
"Pentagons also occur in nature: Fruits of the Okra are pentangular. The flowers of Ipomoea are pentagular. In chemistry, many Cyclic compounds are pentangles: Cyclopentane and Furan are examples for this. In architecture, many bastions are pentangular: Bourtange, in the Netherlands has been completely restored, and is a pentangle. The Citadel of Lille, Nyenschantz, near St. Petersburg, or the Citadel of Pamplona are . The Villa Farnese is a palace in the form of a pentagon, so is the castle of Nowy Wiśnicz. The Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk near Žďár nad Sázavou also uses a pentangular design."

Most of the territory is made of desert flatlands. The largest city is Laâyoune. More than half the population live there. The territory has a population estimated at just more than 500,000."
"Western Sahara has been on the United Nations list of non-self-governing territories since the 1960s when it was a Spanish colony. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario Front, with its Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) government, both claim control over the territory."
"Since 1975, most of the territory has been part of Morocco. In 1973, some Sahrawis claimed the Moroccans and Mauritanians were occupying their land and started a movement. The movement turned violent, and the United Nations brokered a ceasefire in 1991. Many Polisario members and their families became refugees in camps in Algeria. The rest of Western Sahara is controlled by the Polisario/SADR, backed by Algeria. Many important countries have pressed both parties to agree to a peaceful solution. Both Morocco and Polisario have tried to get recognition from other countries. Polisario has won formal recognition for SADR from 81 states, and was extended membership in the African Union, while Morocco has won recognition for its position from the Arab League. In both instances, recognitions have over the past two decades been extended and withdrawn according to changing international trends."
"Some countries (such as the United States) recognizes Morocco's sovereignty on Western Sahara, others claim that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic are the legitimate government in Western Sahara. Most nations remain neutral on the subject. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was made by the Polisario Front an armed militia fighting under Sahrawi nationalism."
Tunis
"Tunis (, ""Tūnis"") is the capital city of Tunisia. As of 2004, 728,463 people lived in the city. About 1.6 million live in the metropolitan area."
Mozambique
"Mozambique, officially the Republic of Mozambique, is a country in southeastern Africa. Its capital is Maputo. There are about 31 million people. In 1975, Mozambique became independent from Portugal. (National Day on 25th June, 1975) The country was named Moçambique by the Portuguese after the Island of Mozambique which was the capital of Portuguese Africa. After independence from Portugal it became the People's Republic of Mozambique. There was a big civil war from 1977 to 1992."
"Mozambique has many natural resources. Portugal, Spain, and Belgium are among the country's most important partners. It is the second poorest country in the world. They have the world's lowest life expectancy. In 2012, large natural gas reserves were found in Mozambique. The revenues from the reserves might dramatically change the economy."
"The only official language of Mozambique is Portuguese. About half the people speak it as a second language and very few as a first language. Languages widely spoken natively include Swahili, Makhuwa, and Sena. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity. There are also Muslim and African traditional religious minorities."
"Mozambique is a member of the African Union, Commonwealth of Nations, the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, the Latin Union, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and Southern African Development Community."
Geography and climate.
"At , Mozambique is the world's 35th-largest country. It is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest."
"The country is divided into two regions by the Zambezi River. To the north of the Zambezi River, the narrow coastline moves inland to hills and low plateaus. Further west are rugged highlands, which include the Niassa highlands, Namuli or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, Tete highlands and the Makonde plateau, covered with miombo woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and Lebombo mountains in the deep south."
"The country has five main rivers and several smaller ones. The largest and most important is the Zambezi. The country has four notable lakes: Lake Niassa (or Malawi), Lake Chiuta, Lake Cahora Bassa and Lake Shirwa, all in the north."
Climate.
Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons. The wet season is from October to March and the dry season from April to September. Conditions vary depending on altitude. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and is less in the north and south. Yearly precipitation changes from depending on the region. Cyclones are common during the wet season. Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from in July to in February.

This is a list of cities and towns with the most people. It is based on the most recent census done for each city or town.
"The next day, November 2 is celebrated as All Souls' Day, souls in Purgatory are especially remembered. Both days are considered important and they are integrated with each other."
The older name is All Hallows or Hallowmas
"All Saints is also a Christian formula involving all the faithful saints and martyrs, known and unknown."
Customs.
"In Portugal, Spain and Mexico, ""ofrendas"" (offerings) are made on this day. In Spain, the play ""Don Juan Tenorio"" is traditionally performed. In Spain, Portugal, Italy and France, people bring flowers to the graves of dead relatives. In Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia, Lithuania, Croatia, Austria and Germany, the tradition is to light candles and visit the graves of deceased relatives. In the Philippines, the day is spent visiting the graves of deceased relatives, where they offer prayers, lay flowers, and light candles, often in a picnic-like atmosphere. In English speaking countries the festival is traditionally celebrated with the hymn ""For All the Saints"" by William Walsham How. The most familiar tune for this hymn is ""Sine Nomine"" by Ralph Vaughan Williams."
The festival was retained after the Reformation in the calendar of the Church of England and in many Lutheran churches.
Ishy Bilady
"""Ishy Bilady"" (, ; ""Long Live My Country"") is the national anthem (a song that represents the country) of the seven United Arab Emirates. The tune was written in the year 1971 without words to sing. Then, in the year 1986 Arif Al Sheikh Abdullah Al Hassan Sahab came up with words for the song. The song is dedicated to the UAE. In the song, the people praise their country by stating that ""the unity of the Emirates has lived"" and ""the United Arab Emirates has lived to be the nation, whose religion is Islam and whose guide is the Quran"" the people also vow to forever work hard and sincerely for the country. The people also state that they ""supply their country with their body, blood and souls."" The song is a representation of love and submission of the Emirati people to country. It music was composed by Mohammed Abdul Wahab."

Origami
"Origami is a traditional Japanese art of paper folding. It uses many techniques and various objects can be created. The object is made of origami paper, which is specially made for folding and staying in shape. Many dictionaries and television shows suggest that origami is only paper cranes, waterbombs, and paper planes, but many new models and creatures have been made because new folding techniques have allowed this."
"When the Japanese first folded origami, they used only one piece of paper. A different kind of origami called ""modular origami"" uses many small pieces that are the same, which are combined to form one large model. Also, many mathematical shapes can be made with origami."
History.
"The beginnings of origami are not clear. Paperfolding started in China in the 1st or 2nd century. It finally came to Japan in the 6th century. Instead of making models that looked exactly like things, the first origami models only looked similar to things. People often folded models and gave them to other people for good luck. For example, Shinto nobles celebrated weddings with sake in glasses decorated with origami butterflies, which gave good luck to the bride and groom."
"There were also independent paperfolding traditions in other countries, like Germany and Spain. The earliest evidence of paperfolding in Europe is a picture of a boat in 1490. There was also a paper box from 1440. Finally, in 1845, ""Kan no mado"" was written, and it was the first book of origami models."
"Recently, people have become more interested in origami. In 1954, Japanese paperfolder Akira Yoshizawa created rules to explain how to fold origami models. His instructions on paperfolding are now used in all countries."
Paper.
"Peter Engel, who is a well-known paperfolder, says ""the best paper [for origami] is thin and crisp and absolutely square."" Pre-cut origami paper is sold in many colors, sizes, and patterns. Duo paper, or paper with different colors on each side, is used by paperfolders because it makes areas of different color on the finished model. There are also special papers, like textured, metallic, and patterned."
"Nash was born on June 13, 1928, in Bluefield, West Virginia. He studied at Princeton University and at Carnegie Institute of Technology."
Career.
"The winner of a Westinghouse scholarship, he attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he received both his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in 1948. From Pittsburgh he went to Princeton University where he worked on his equilibrium theory. He received a Ph.D. in 1950 with a dissertation on non-cooperative games. The thesis, which was written under the supervision of Albert W. Tucker, contained the definition and properties of what would later be called the Nash equilibrium. His studies on this subject led to three articles:"
Nash also did important work in the area of manifolds (complex spatial structures):
"This work led to ""Nash embedding theorem"": ""Two real algebraic manifolds are equivalent if and only if they are analytically homeomorphic."""
Personal life.
"He is best known in popular culture as the subject of the Hollywood movie, ""A Beautiful Mind"", about his mathematical genius and his struggles with schizophrenia, with which he was diagnosed."
"Nash married Alicia Lopez-Harrison de Lardé in 1957. They had one son. Nash had a first son out of wedlock to Elenor Stier.. In 1963, the couple divorced. They later remarried in 2001. Nash lived in West Windsor Township, New Jersey for a long time."
Death.
"On May 23, 2015, Nash and his wife Alicia were killed in a car accident near Monroe Township, New Jersey. A taxi that they were riding in was struck by another vehicle and the pair was ejected from the taxi. Nash was 86 years old."

Calisthenics
"Calisthenics is a series of exercises used to develop strength, power and balance or a repeated rhythmical exercise that uses the weight of the body as resistance or the systematic exercises for attaining strength-gracefulness or the practice of calisthenic exercises."
"The name calisthenics is Greek in origin, a combination of the words 'beauty' and 'strength'."
"Calisthenics is recommended for general good health, light exercises designed to promote general physical fitness."
Muteness
"Muteness means not being able to speak. A person that cannot speak is called a mute. A mute keeps the ability to hear the speech of others. If not, the person would be a deaf mute."
"Muteness is a type of speech disorder. A person who chooses not to speak is said to be ""silent"" rather than mute. Slang for this (British English) is ""keeping mum""."
"Originally, the common word dumb or ""dumbness"" used to mean ""unable to speak"". Unfortunately this was taken over to mean """"unwilling"" to speak"" or ""unintelligent"". So people prefer ""muteness"". ""Dumb"" is a much commoner word, and might be used if it would not be misunderstood."
Cause (eteliology).
"In general, someone who is mute may be mute for one of several different reasons: genetics, psychological, or trauma."
"For children, a lack of speech may be developmental, neurological, psychological, or due to a physical disability or a communication disorder."
"Adults who previously had speech and then became unable to speak: this may be due to disease, injury, damage or surgery affecting areas of the brain needed for speech. Loss of speech in adults may occur, but rarely, for psychological reasons. Damage (however caused) to the parts of the brain needed for speech is called aphasia."
Action.
"Treatment or management of muteness depends on what has caused the absence of speech. A speech assessment may decide cause and treatment. Treatment of absence of speech is possible in a variety of cases. If the absence of speech is a permanent condition, a range of communication devices are available to help communication."
Speech-generating devices help people with speech deficiencies.

"Columbine, Colorado"
"Columbine is a census-designated place (CDP) in Arapahoe and Jefferson counties in the U.S. state of Colorado. Located mostly in Jefferson County, it lies west of the Denver suburb of Littleton. As of the 2010 census, the CDP had a population of 24,280."
"In 1999, Columbine was the site of the Columbine High School massacre."
"Lakewood, Colorado"
"Lakewood is a city in Colorado, the United States. It was founded in 1889."
Its population ranks fifth of all the Colorado cities. It ranks 172nd (in population) out of all the cities in the United States.
"In 2010, the population was 142,980."
"According to the United States Census in 2010, the city population was 142,980. Lakewood is to the west of Denver, Colorado's capital. It is one of the key cities of the Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area and a major city of the Front Range Urban Corridor."
History.
"This urban and suburban community was started in 1889 by Charles Welch and W.A.H. Loveland; who platted a 13-block area along Colfax Avenue west of Denver in eastern Jefferson County. Loveland used to be the president of the Colorado Central Railroad and lived in Golden. After retiring, he moved to the new area known as Lakewood."
"Up until 1969, this area known as Lakewood didn't have a city government. Instead, they relied on water districts, fire districts, and the government of Jefferson County. This area known as Lakewood was more of a community and had been around for 80 years. Police protection was provided to them by the Jefferson County Sheriff and volunteers from fire districts."
"In 1969, the City of Lakewood was legally turned into Jefferson City. Not too long after, they held an election. They decided to change the city's name to Lakewood because the majority disliked ""Jefferson City,"" and believes it would be confused with existing communities in Colorado and Missouri. At this time, the population was already over 90,000."
"Lakewood never had a traditional downtown area. West Colfax Avenue served the metropolitan area as U.S. Route 40 and the main route that joined Denver with the Rocky Mountains. Colfax from Harlan west to Kipling and beyond had mostly commercial establishments. Originally, in Lakewood, there was only the Jewish Conspumtive Relief Society (JCRS) for tuberculosis patients, a small, frame Methodist Church, and telephone exchange. However, by the 1950s, grocery and drug stores, gas stations, restaurants and taverns, several motels, branch banks, a movie theater, a roller rink, a bowling alley, and used car lots could be found as well. Several shopping centers with multiple businesses also developed."
"In 2011, Lakewood was named an All-America City for the first time."
Geography.
"Lakewood is located at at an elevation of . It is located in the middle of U.S. Route 6 and Colorado State Highway 121 in central Colorado,positioned immediately west of Denver and north-northwest of Colorado Springs."
"Lakewood lies in the Colorado Piedmont on the western edge of the Great Plains, just east of the Front Range of the southern Rocky Mountains. Green Mountain, a mesa tall, is located in the far west-central part of the city."
"Lakewood is located in the watershed of the South Platte River. Several small tributaries of the river flow east through it. From north to south, this includes Lakewood Gulch, Weir Gulch, Sanderson Gulch, and Bear Creek. Two tributaries of Lakewood Gulch, Dry Gulch and McIntyre Gulch, flow east through the northern part of the city. Turkey Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek, flows northeast through the far southwestern part of the city. In addition, Lena Gulch, a tributary of Clear Creek to the north, flows east then north through the extreme northwestern part of the city."
"Several small lakes and reservoirs are in Lakewood. The Soda Lakes lie in the far southwestern part of the city. East of them lies Bear Creek Lake, a reservoir fed by Bear Creek and Turkey Creek. Clustered near each other in central Lakewood are Main Reservoir, East Reservoir, Smith Reservoir, Kendrick Lake, and Cottonwood Lake. Northeast of them lies Kountze Lake. In the northwestern part of the city, Lena Gulch both feeds and drains Maple Grove Reservoir. In the far southern part of the city lies Bowles Reservoir No. 1 and, just outside the city limits to the reservoir's northeast, Marston Lake."
"According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . Of which are land and (2.7%) are covered by water."
"As a suburb of Denver, Lakewood is part of both the greater Denver metropolitan area and the Front Range Urban Corridor. It borders other communities on all sides, including Wheat Ridge to the north, Edgewater to the northeast, Denver to the east and southeast, Dakota Ridge to the south, Morrison to the southwest, and Golden, West Pleasant View, East Pleasant View, and Applewood to the northwest."
Climate.
"Lakewood experiences a semiarid climate (Köppen ""BSk"") with winters tha fluctuate between mild to cold and snowy while summers are warm to hot, with great temperature differences (about 30°F) between day and night year round. Precipitation happens mostly in the spring and summer."
Demographics.
"As of the 2010 census, 142,980 people, 61,986 households, and 35,882 families lived in the city. The population density was 3,334.4 people per square mile (1,286.9/km). Its 65,758 housing units averaged 1,533.5 per square mile (591.9/km). The racial makeup of the city was 82.9% White, 3.1% Asian, 1.6% Black, 1.4% American Indian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 7.7% from other races, and 3.3% from two or more races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race were 22.0% of the population."
"Out of the 61,986 households, 26.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 41.1% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a male householder with no wife present, 11.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 42.1% were not families. About 33.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 10.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.27, and the average family size was 2.92."
"When looking at the population by age, it was 20.8% under the age of 18, 9.6% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 28.0% from 45 to 64, and 14.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The average age was 39.2 years. The population divided by gender was 48.9% male and 51.1% female."

About 9.1% of families and 11.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 20.3% of those under age 18 and 6.1% of those age 65 or over."
Economy.
"In Russia, which became the Soviet Union after the 1917 Revolution, composers were not allowed to be experimental. It was difficult for them because they had to please the politicians who told them that their music should reflect “Socialist realism” (meaning the workers’ struggle against capitalism). The great tradition of writing symphonies continued with Sergei Prokofiev (who spent some time in exile) and Shostakovich (who remained in the Soviet Union)."
"The Hungarian composer Béla Bartók developed a modern style influenced by folk music from his country and other East European countries. His music is often quite neoclassical, for example the famous ""Concerto for Orchestra""."
Avant garde experiments.
"In the mid-20th century a group of composers known as the “Darmstadt School” (because they often met in Darmstadt) continued to write music which was based on serialism. This included Pierre Boulez and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Many of them, including both Boulez and Stockhausen, also experimented with electronic music. The term Avant Garde is often used to describe their music. It means that it expands the limits, or pushes ahead into new ground (literally the “front guard”, a military analogy). Other American composers were experimental, e.g. Charles Ives and John Cage who is famous for using a “prepared piano” (a piano which makes strange sounds because strange objects are put inside it)."
Jazz influence.
"In America jazz was a big influence on classical composers. George Gershwin’s music is halfway between jazz and classical. Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein used jazz elements in their music. In Europe many composer used ideas from jazz, e.g. Maurice Ravel and Kurt Weill."
Minimalism.
"Around the 1960s some composers thought that a lot of music was getting too complicated. Music of the avant garde school such as Edgard Varèse, Elliott Carter, Milton Babbitt was becoming too difficult for people to understand. People found it too mathematical and intellectual. They wanted music with feeling and emotion. A group of composers developed a style called Minimalism which uses music based around a simple idea which repeats itself again and again but gradually changes. Steve Reich, Philip Glass, Terry Riley, John Cage and to some extent John Adams all used minimalist techniques. It was a reaction against music that had become too complicated."
Other paths based on tradition.
"While all these different schools of thought were coming and going there were still some composers who managed to keep to a more traditional path and find new ways to use tonality in their music. The greatest figure in British music was Benjamin Britten who was an eclectic composer (i.e. he took ideas from many different people). Two other great composers were Michael Tippett and William Walton, who each developed their own style. In America there were composers such as Samuel Barber, Roy Harris and Alan Hovhaness. In Germany Paul Hindemith was one of the most important composers. Like Kurt Weill, he often wrote music which had a political purpose, but Weill's music is more jazz-inspired."
"Some contemporary composers (alive today) write music which is deeply religious. These include John Tavener and Arvo Pärt. John Rutter and Bob Chilcott, who write music for choirs which sounds fresh and attractive to new audiences. Other composers have found various ways of creating their own style, e.g. the Scottish composers James MacMillan and Judith Weir and the Master of the Queen's Music: Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. In Russia Sofia Gubaidulina and Galina Ustvolskaya are important voices in the search for new music."
Cuxhaven
"Cuxhaven ( , ; ) is an independent town and seat of Cuxhaven, in Lower Saxony, Germany. The town includes the northernmost point of Lower Saxony. It is on the shore of the North Sea at the mouth of the Elbe River. Cuxhaven has a footprint of (east–west) by (north–south).

Haifa Wehbe
"Haifa Wehbe (, born March 10, 1972) is a female Lebanese singer, actress, model, and jewelry designer who is known in the Arab world. Wehbe was born in a rural town in South Lebanon and currently lives in Beirut. She started her music career with her debut album ""Huwa az-Zaman"" (, ""It is Time"")."
Early life and career.

"Her second 2005 album was ""Baddi 'Ayš"" (, ""I Want to Live""). Her second songs was ""Ana Haifa"" (""I am Haifa"")."
She also appeared in Pepsi ad with French footballer Thierry Henry.
Dynamics (music)
"In music, the dynamics in the piece is the variation in loudness between notes or phrases."
"In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that “piano”, as a dynamic level, is pronounced the Italian way (“pi-AH-no”)."
"Use more than two ps or fs to show that the music is very, very quiet, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five ps or fs, though only up to three are normally found in sheet music."
"Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured exactly. Exactly how loud mp should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another."
Vasily Chuikov
"Vasily Chuykov (February 12, 1900 – March 18, 1982) was a medieval fish."
"During World War II he was commanding the 62nd army, with which he was especially outstanding himself in the Battle of Stalingrad."
"He was twice Hero of the Soviet Union (1944, 1945)."
He was made Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1955.
Power Purchasing Agreement
"A Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) is a legal contract between a electricity provider and a land owner. The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines."
Schools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.
"Power Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 – 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider."
Power Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies. The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases.
Some of the electricity providers who offer PPAs are:
Pioneer plaque
The Pioneer plaques were a pair of plaques that were launched into deep space on Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11. The same image is on both plaques. The image is made up of many parts.
There is a drawing of a nude human female and a nude human male.
There is a diagram of the change in spin of the electron of a hydrogen particle. This diagram is meant to set up a universal unit of length and a universal unit of time for the rest of the image.
"There is a crude map of our solar system showing a spacecraft leaving the third planet, Earth. There have been negative reactions about the arrow showing the trajectory of the spacescraft. Alien species may not understand the human concept of a line and arrow."
"There is pattern of lines that looks like a star burst design. This is a map. There are 15 lines. 14 of the lines have a long binary number engraved along it. The binary numbers are distances. The distances are not in meters or kilometers, but in the universal unit of distance given by the hydrogen particle diagram. The 14 lines give the distance from the sun to 14 pulsars. The 15th line gives the distance from the sun to the center of the galaxy."
Clube Atlético Mineiro
"Clube Atlético Mineiro is a Brazilian football club. Atletico Mineiro was founded in 1908 in the city of Belo Horizonte, where the team plays. The team has ""Galo"" (rooster) as its mascot, for this reason the club is also known simply as Galo."
"Atletico Mineiro is one of the most traditional football clubs in Brazil, being the first champion of the modern version of the Brazilian Football Championhsip. The most important achievement of the club was the Copa Libertadores de America in 2013, which is regarded as the most important tournament in South America."
"In the last five years, Atletico Mineiro is probably passing through the most victorious period in its history, since in the last five years the team has played five out of the nine Copa Libertadores editions the team has ever disputed."

Bee Gees
"The Bee Gees were a British–Australian pop group. For most of its history, the band consisted of three brothers all of whom were born on the Isle of Man, a British Crown Dependency. The brothers, Barry Gibb (born 1 September 1946), and twins Maurice Gibb (22 December 1949 – 12 January 2003) and Robin Gibb (22 December 1949 – 20 May 2012), started singing at a young age when living in Manchester. In the late 1960s, the band briefly expanded to include Australian born Vince Melouney and Colin Petersen. When the band reformed after splitting in 1969, Australian born Geoff Bridgford briefly became a member. The Bee Gees existed for almost 40 years They are most famous for their album, ""Saturday Night Fever"", the soundtrack for the movie of the same name. They stopped performing after Maurice died. The two other brothers reunited as a duo in 2009. In 2012 Robin died. They had a younger brother, Andy Gibb (1958–1988), who was also a singer."
Group history.
"The Gibb brothers were born on the Isle of Man, then lived in Manchester, England, before moving to Australia in 1958. It was in Australia that the Bee Gees' band was formed. In January 1967, the Gibb brothers returned to England where their band the Bee Gees started to become internationally famous. In 1967, Colin Petersen and Vince Melouney joined the band but by the end the decade both had left and the brothers themselves had briefly gone their separate ways, only to reform in 1970. Between 1970 and 1972, Geoff Bridgford was a member of the Bee Gees. In 1975, the brothers relocated to the United States."

"The Improverts are an improvised comedy group based in Edinburgh, Scotland. They are a part of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company. Their home is the Bedlam Theatre. It has been their home since they were created 18 years ago. The group is similar to ""Who's Line is it Anyway?"", Comedy Store Players, and Keith Johnstone in that they use short improvised games."
They have taken part in the Edinburgh Fringe Festival almost every year since they were formed. Also they have played every Friday night during the school year (as their main audience is Edinburgh University students).
"Because they are always in Bedlam Theatre, the theatre technicians improvise the sounds, music and lights along with the scenes the performers are doing. The sounds can be loud and annoying at times. The technicians show off their very big iTunes library of songs and sound effects. British 80's children's programmes' themes are a favourite of theirs."
"Past players have gone on to many different things. They have created an improv group in London, joined the Stand Players' ""Who's Lunch is it anyway"" free improv show at Edinburgh's The Stand comedy venue and become successful stand up comedians. Some have starred in British sitcoms, television dramas, movies and popular children's programmes"
Taipei 101
"Taipei 101 () is 101-floor building in Taipei, Republic of China (Taiwan). In 2004, it replaced the Willis Tower (which used to be called the Sears Tower) as the tallest completed building in the world. However, in 2010, it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai."
Taipei 101 holds records for:
"Taipei 101 does not hold the record for tallest building from ground to pinnacle. The Sears Tower has two television antennas on top of it, making its height from the ground to the top of the taller antenna 527 m (1,729 ft)."
Effect on Taipei's economy.
"Taipei 101 is the recognized symbol of Taipei city, it brings a lot of tourists every day. The location of Taipei 101 is at the southern end of the Xinyi District, the newest area of Taipei city. Besides the tower, the base of the building houses includes a multi-level shopping mall, food court, various restaurants and stores, and an global grocery store. Every New Year's Eve, Taipei 101 is host to an impressive fireworks display that attracts people from all over Taiwan and other neighboring countries like Japan and Singapore to the area."
Observatory Information.
"The Taipei 101 Observatory is open every day from 9AM to 10PM. The observatory is spread over 4 floors where visitors can enjoy the fantastic scenery and learn about the engineering marvel that is Taipei 101, the tallest green building in the world. Visitors can buy the tickets on the 5F Taipei 101 Mall, the general ticket costs NT$500 per each and the student ticket (with valid ID) costs NT$450 per each, all children (under 115 cm) are free.

Inside the building, on the 91F, is a small theater showcasing films about the building and the annual New Year fireworks display. The 91st floor is only open on days with good weather conditions."
Survive ways from earthquake and typhoons.
"The second degree is a tear of a ligament, which is usually followed by pain or swelling."
The third degree is a complete rupture.
Signs and symptoms.
The typical signs and symptoms associated with a sprain are the main signs of inflammation:
Joints involved.
"Although any joint can experience a sprain, some of the more common include:"
Prevention.
"Sprains can best be prevented by proper use of safety equipment (wrist, ankle guards), warm-ups and cool-downs (including stretching), being aware of your surroundings and maintaining strength and flexibility. Physical conditioning is the best way to avoid or lessen the degree of sprains."
Second Sino-Japanese War
"The Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 to September 3, 1945) was a major war fought between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan. It became part of World War II when Japan entered that war. Part of the Sino-Japanese war was fought in northern Burma and northeastern India. The war ended when Japan surrendered after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It started in 1937 43 years after the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894 lead by Emperor Meiji who was the father of Emperor Taishō and the Grandfather of Hirohito ."
Invasion of China.
The Second Sino-Japanese War began when Japan invaded China in 1931. Japan used the Mukden Incident as an excuse to invade China. The invasion grew into a full-scale war after the Marco-Polo Bridge Incident. Japanese officers said that a Japanese soldier got lost and they were allowed to find him in Beiping.
Japan invaded China for a few reasons:
"While the Imperial Japanese Army was trying to take over China, the KMT (the Nationalist Government under Chiang Kai-Shek) and the CCP (Chinese Communist Party under Mao Zedong) cooperated a little to try to fight off Japan together. This was called the ""Chinese United Front"". However, for the most part, they continued to fight each other as well."
Japanese occupation of China.
"In 1931, the Imperial Japanese Army began to occupy China, starting in the northeast (Manchuria), where they created a puppet state called Manchukuo. In 1937, they occupied Beiping (now called Beijing), and then Nanjing. For six weeks in Nanjing, the army committed the Nanjing Massacre. During this massacre, Japanese soldiers killed between 40,000 and 300,000 Chinese people, and raped at least 20,000 women and girls."
"After six weeks, the Japanese Army left Nanjing. It finally occupied the industrial cities in southern China. Chiang moved his capital city from Nanjing to Chongqing, and began a tactic of ""using space to trade for time."" He was able to spread Japanese soldiers out too thin. This means they were covering too much space with too few soldiers. This made them harder to fight, and made it easier for partisans to fight back in occupied China."
"Many soldiers died on both sides at this time. However, in 1940, the Japanese Army stopped being able to move farther into China and take more land. 1940 also marked the point where China began to be able to fight back, instead of Japan continuing to take over the country."
End of the war 1941-1945.
"After Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in the United States on December 7, 1941, the Second Sino-Japanese War became part of World War II. It became a part of the area of fighting called the China-Burma-India theatre. The entrance of the United States into the war in Asia meant that the Chinese military forces started receiving lend-lease supplies from the British and Americans over the Burma Road. This helped the Chinese fight back and get much-needed modern weapons."
"The Second Sino-Japanese War had damaged Japan. It had not been able to win the war against China quickly. Instead, Japan's military had already been fighting China for four years. This made it much more difficult for Japan to keep fighting (now in the Pacific against the Allied forces). This may have been one reason why Japan eventually lost the war."
"In China, the war had some important effects. It made more people support the Chinese Communist Party. It also made Chiang's Republic fall apart more quickly, in 1949."
Ligament
"In anatomy, the word ligament usually means the fibrous tissue that joins bones to other bones or cartilages."
"A ligament is a short band of tough fibrous connective tissue made of long, stringy collagen fibres. Ligaments join bones to other bones to form a joint. They do ""not"" connect muscles to bones; that is the function of tendons. Some ligaments limit the amount of movement in a joint, or stop certain movements altogether."
"Ligaments are only slightly elastic; when under tension, they gradually lengthen. This is one reason why dislocated joints must be set as quickly as possible: if the ligaments lengthen too much, then the joint will be weakened. Athletes, gymnasts, dancers, and martial artists perform stretching exercises to lengthen their ligaments, making their joints more supple."
"The result of a broken ligament can be instability of the joint. Not all broken ligaments need surgery, but if surgery is needed to stabilise the joint, the broken ligament can be joined."
Powiat
"A county (Polish: ""powiat"", pronounced ""povyat""; plural, ""powiaty"") is the Polish second-level unit of administration, equivalent to a county, district or prefecture in other countries. A county is part of a larger unit called a ""voivodship"" (in Polish, ""województwo"". One would call it in English ""province"")."
"The Baluchistan States Union existed between 3 October 1952 and 14 October 1955 in modern southwest Pakistan. It was formed by the states of Kalat, Kharan, Las Bela and Makran with the capital at the town of Kalat. The area of the Union was roughly the western half of the modern province of Balochistan. The Union was separate from the Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan which comprised areas to the northeast of the Union. The Union did not include the enclave of Gwadar City which was part of the Sultanate of Oman. The four state rulers continued in office but some matters became the responsibility of the Council of Rulers."
Baluchistan (Chief Commissioner's Province)
The Chief Commissioners Province of Baluchistan was a former province of British India. It was in the northern parts of the modern Pakistani province of Balochistan.
Interwar period
"The interwar period was a time in history from 9 November 1918 to 1 September 1939, between the two world wars, World War I and World War II."
"The period began with many changes internationally. The League of Nations was created, which was made to bring peace to the world, but did not prevent problems with Nazi Germany, which soon left the League. Also occurred was the growing threat of Japan, which invaded China. Soon the Soviet Union and Italy had begun to rise as international powers. All of that happened in the 21 years and soon triggered World War II."
Modernism
"Modernism was a cultural movement of the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It changed art, literature, music, architecture and drama."
"Modernism rejected tradition. It was interested in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that science and technology could change the world for the better. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory."
Art.
"Modern art replaced classical art. It included abstract art, cubism, pop art, minimalism, and Dadaism. It affected sculpture quite strongly, though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works. Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors."
"Typical modernist painters were Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky and Mondrian."
Music.
"Composers such as Stravinsky, George Antheil and Schoenberg are modernists. Stravinsky's ""The Rite of Spring"" (""Le Sacre du Printemps"") is a landmark work."
Dance.
"Ballets such as ""The Rite of Spring"" and ""Les Noces"" (""The Wedding"") mark the arrival of modernism into this traditional dance form. Modern dance outside of ballet started with Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller and Ruth St. Denis."
Literature.
"James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" is the classic example of modernism in the novel. ""Ulysses"" (1922) has been called ""a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement"". Franz Kafka's ""The Metamorphosis"" (1915), ""The Trial"" (1925) and T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Waste Land"" (1922) are also prime examples. Looking back, it is clear that: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"" (1866) had a great influence on other writers."
"The arrival of magic realism is part of modernism. The novels and short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov such as ""Diabolidad"" and ""The Master and Margarita"" are examples."
Architecture.
"Modernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius the founder of Bauhaus, and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier's famous remark ""A building is a machine for living in"" shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century. The skyscraper, such as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956–1958), became the archetypal modernist building."
Criticism.
"A criticism of the modern movement is that it does not value tradition, and goes in for change for the sake of change. What modernists want most is freedom of expression, or, perhaps, freedom of experimentation. This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things. In modernist literature, an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books."
"These experiments were not random. They drew on the ideas of their day: mass media, science and technology, Marxism, Freudian psychology, and so on. There was a general search for new materials, new methods and new ideas. There was often a rejection of elitism, and a love of populism and popular culture."
Another criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism. Certainly many modernists were also socialists. In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past. This also explains their rejection of tradition.
Victorian era
The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was a time of Queen Victoria's rule from 1837 to 1901. This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A well educated middle class ruled the country and the British Empire. Other countries also prospered but Britain became the greatest great power.
"The Industrial Revolution continued to increase productivity and prosperity, especially in the middle and later parts of Victoria's reign. Making iron and steel was a basic industry. The furnaces were fired with coal. Shipbuilding was a major industry. Canals and steam railways connected all parts of the country, and British steamships connected the world. Cotton and wool were made into cloth and exported. Ceramics were also a major industry."
"Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990 Prague has become one of Europe's most popular tourist places. It has buildings dating from the 13th century to the present day. The castle looks very important on the hillside. Charles Bridge is now closed to traffic so that pedestrians can walk across the bridge and buy souvenirs from the stalls. There are many museums, palaces and theatres. Tourists often go to the Old Town Square in the centre of Prague. There are lots of buildings there from different periods of history. The statue of Jan Hus stands high above the square. There is a famous Astronomical Clock on the wall of the Old Town Hall. There are museums dedicated to famous people including Smetana, Dvořák and Franz Kafka. The Estates Theatre is one of Europe’s oldest theaters. It was built in the 1780s and Mozart conducted the first performance of his opera ""Don Giovanni"" there."
Prague is on the list of World Heritage Sites.
Economics.
"Prague has been important in the economy of what is now the Czech Republic since the region developed industry in the 19th century. Textiles and machinery are made and exported to many countries. Food, electronics and chemicals are produced. Nearly half the people who work are women."
"Prague is becoming a city where many international companies have their headquarters. Since the late 1990s, Prague has become a popular filming location for international productions and Hollywood motion pictures."
There are no ghettos in Prague.
Colleges and universities.
"The city contains several universities and colleges including the oldest university in Central and Eastern Europe: the Charles University, founded in 1348."
Transport.
"Prague has three metro lines, 20 tram lines, and buses that connect to the suburbs. There is also a funicular rail link to the top of the Petřín Hill and a chairlift at Prague Zoo. All these services have a common ticketing system."
"Prague metro is one of the best in Europe for quality and speed. It has got 3 lines (A, B, and C), 65 kilometers and 61 stations."
Trains from Prague connect to major cities in neighbouring countries.
"There is a modern airport, Václav Havel airport Prague, used by many airlines including Czech Airlines."
Sport.
"Prague has many parks and gardens, including a park for culture, sports and entertainments which is named after Julius Fučík, a resistance leader of World War II. It has three stadiums, the largest of which, Spartakiádní stadion, holds 250,000 people. They have a good Soccer team and play many sports."
Wallet
"A wallet is a small flat container, mostly of leather or fabric, that a person uses to hold cash, credit cards, identification cards, etc. Most men usually keep their wallets in their pockets, while women usually keep them in larger bags called purses."
"Wallets, particularly in Europe, where larger coins are prevalent, contain also a coin purse compartments. Some wallets have built-in clasps or bands to keep them closed."
"As European banknotes, such as Euros and Pounds, are typically larger than American banknotes in size, they do not fit in some smaller American wallets."
"A cryptocurrency wallet is a device, program, or service that stores public and/or private keys for cryptocurrency transactions. In addition to this basic function, a cryptocurrency wallet most often also offers provides encryption and/or the use of a digital signature. Any crypto wallet is a combination of a private key and a public address. There are the following options for crypto wallets: hardware, desktop, paper, mobile, web wallets."
Memory card
"A memory card is a form of flash memory that is used in a range of electronic devices such as a digital camera or video game console. The memory card stores data, images, music, saved games or other computer files."
"Flash memory devices like this contain no moving parts so they are not easily damaged. This means that they are ideal for use in portable devices such as MP3 players, digital cameras, mobile phones etc."
"The amount of data memory cards can store depends on the ""capacity"" of the card. Currently (in 2017) the largest memory cards can store 1 terabyte of data. As the technology improves, larger capacity cards are expected."
"There are many different types of memory cards, for example MultiMediaCard or CompactFlash, but the majority are SD cards or MicroSD."
Computer printer
"A computer printer is a piece of hardware for a computer. It allows a user to print items on paper, such as letters and pictures. Usually a printer prints under the control of a computer. Many can also work as a photocopier or with a digital camera to print directly without using a computer."
Types of printers.
"Today, the following types of printers are in regular use:"
Certifications and sales.
"In February 2008, RIAA reduced the certification-award-levels for Oro y De Platino to Gold=50,000 and Platinum=100,000."
Ones (album)
"Ones is a greatest hits album by Selena. The album included an unreleased ballad song. The album sold over 500,000 copies in the United States."
Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front
JKLF seeks independence of Jammu and Kashmir state from both India and Pakistan.
"The JKLF claims that they are not Islamist, but are nationalist, and opposes the emergence of the territories into either Pakistan or India but rather wants the region of Kashmir to separate from the three countries and become independent."
"In 1982 branches were established in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, Pakistan and in 1987 in Indian-administered Kashmir (Jammu and Kashmir)."
Mirador de la Flor
"Mirador de la Flor () is a life-sized statue that is in Corpus Christi, Texas. The statue is a memorial to American singer Selena. The statue was ordered by the Mayor of Corpus Christi as a tourist attraction in 1997. Hundreds of fans visit the statue weekly from all over the world. The statue faces Corpus Christi bay, where the gun that killed Selena was thrown. A second life-sized statue of Selena was made in Mexico in March 2011."
Marie Joséphine of Savoy
"Marie Joséphine of Savoy (Maria Giuseppina Luigia; 2 September 1753 – 13 November 1810) was the wife of the future Louis XVIII of France. She was a princess of Savoy by birth, became the titular Queen consort, and was known by her title: Her Royal Highness, Countess of Provence (""comtesse de Provence"")."
Family.
"She was born at the Royal Palace of Turin on 2 September 1753 and was the third child and second daughter of Victor Amadeus and his wife the Spanish Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain. At the time of her birth her grandfather, Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, was the King of Sardinia."
Marriage.
"Maria Giuseppina was engaged to the French Prince Louis Stanislas of France. He was known as the Count of Provence. They were married on 16 April 1771 ""by proxy"" in the Turin. They were married in person on 14 May 1771 at the Palace of Versailles. A luxurious ball followed the wedding on 20 May. She was considered to be ugly. Louis Stanislas hated his wife. We know today that these rumors were created by those who supported Marie Antoinette as a rivalry soon emerged after the youngest brother 'comte d'Artois', married the Comtesse's sister, thereby bringing yet another Savoyard princess to Versailles and creating an Italian party at court."
"In France she was known as Marie Joséphine de Savoie. She had a high rank at court as her husband was a grandson of the reiging king. She was a cousin of the ill-fated ""Princess of Lamballe"" who was instrumental in the arrangement of the marriage. At the death of her husband’s grandfather Louis XV in 1774, her brother-in-law succeeded as Louis XVI. She became pregnant in 1774 and 1781, but both pregnancies ended in miscarriage. In 1791 Marie Joséphine went to Germany. During the period of exile, the Count and Countess fought constantly. Some historians have suggested Marie Joséphine's possible lesbian relationship with a lady-in-waiting as the primary cause for discord between the couple."
"Marie Joséphine died of an edema at Hartwell House, English residence of the exiled French royal family. Marie Joséphine was laid to rest in the Lady Chapel of Westminster Abbey. Her body was removed a year later on Louis's orders and buried in the Kingdom of Sardinia; today in Cagliari Cathedral."
Islam in Palestine
"Islam is the religion of the majority of the Palestinian population residing in the Palestinian territories, with Muslims comprising 75% of the population of the West Bank, and 99% of the population of the Gaza Strip."
"Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. The ""Haram al Sharif"" (Temple Mount) of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to Jannah (paradise); there is no mention of Jerusalem in the Koran, however."
This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque. Muslims are sensitive to and mindful of the circumstance that two mosques along with the rest of East Jerusalem are claimed and illegally occupied by the state of Israel.
Specific impulse
"Specific impulse (often shortened to ""I""sp) is a way to describe how well a rocket performs. It is also used to describe how well a jet engine performs. It can be used to compare rockets of different sizes. It is a way to know how much force a given engine makes for each bit of fuel. To do this, one needs to know how much fuel is in the engine. A high specific impulse means that a rocket needs less fuel to perform as well. If the specific impulse is lower, it means that the rocket needs more fuel to perform as well."
"Specific impulse is a useful value to compare rocket or jet engines. It is used much like ""miles per gallon"" or ""litres per 100 kilometres"" is used to compare cars. An engine with a higher specific impulse uses fuel better. This means that the same amount of fuel lets the rocket go faster after all fuel is depleted."
"A rocket engine with a higher specific impulse doesn't mean it's 'more powerful'. That is, it will not make the rocket accelerate harder. In fact, the designs for engines with the highest specific impulse, like ion engines, are the 'weakest' of all types of engines. They accelerate the rocket slowly but steadily over a long period of time using only a tiny amount of fuel. In a race between two rockets with the same amount of fuel and two different engines the one with the more powerful engine will take an early lead, but when it burns down all its fuel, the rocket with higher specific impulse will still have some fuel left and will continue to accelerate. Eventually it will overtake its counterpart and will win the race if the distance is big enough for it to use its long-term advantage."
Leader.
"The Government is led by the Prime Minister, who chooses the other Ministers. The Prime Minister and the other most powerful Ministers belong to a group known as the Cabinet, who are the most important decision makers in the Government. These ministers are all members of Parliament (MPs). Laws are made by MPs voting in Parliament, which is called 'legislative authority'. These laws make what is called primary legislation."
"The Prime Minister now is Rishi Sunak, the present leader of the Conservative Party. Liz Truss, the former leader, was only Prime Minister for a short time and had succeeded Boris Johnson, who had been Prime Minister from 2019 until his resignation in 2022."
Election.
"The government is chosen by the people indirectly. The people of the United Kingdom vote in a general election, appointing representatives to the Parliament, at least once every five years. The monarch must select as Prime Minister the person who is likely to have the support of Parliament. By convention, that is normally the leader of the party that has the most MPs in the House of Commons. The Prime Minister leads the government and exercises executive power on behalf of the monarch, in accordance with the laws set by Parliament, including appointing Ministers to the executive branches of government."
"Under the British constitution, laws are made or unmade by Parliament. The policy and administration of the laws is done by the direction of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. This is called executive authority. The monarch is obliged to follow the advice of the government and has not refused to do so since the 17th century. The Cabinet members advise the monarch as part of a group called Privy Council. They also use their power directly as leaders of the Government departments."
The British kind of government is sometimes called parliamentary government.
Local governments.
"There are separate governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each responsible to their own local parliament. These parliaments have certain limits decided by the main parliament in Westminster. There is no separate English Parliament."
Margaux Hemingway
"Margot Louise Hemingway (February 16, 1954-July 1, 1996), later called Margaux Hemingway, was an American actress and fashion model. She was born in Portland, Oregon. She was the sister of Mariel Hemingway. On July 1, 1996, the day before the anniversary of her grandfather Ernest Hemingway's own suicide, Margaux killed herself: she overdosed with a drug called phenobarbital. She was found dead inside her apartment in Santa Monica, California."
Styx (moon)
"Styx (formerly known as S/2012 (134340) 1 and informally as P5) is a small moon of the dwarf planet Pluto. It was discovered on June 26, 2012, using the Hubble Space Telescope. It is the fifth moon of Pluto discovered so far. The others are Charon, discovered in 1978, Nix and Hydra, which were discovered in 2005, and Kerberos, discovered in 2011."
Discovery.
"The moon was discovered using nine sets of images taken between 26 June and 9 July 2012 by Wide Field Camera 3 of the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA announced the discovery on 11 July 2012. The images were taken as part of a Hubble survey searching for potential hazards for the New Horizons mission. The New Horizons space probe is going to Pluto at the moment and will arrive in July 2015. The discovery of the moon has made scientists worried about the mission. Pluto may have more bodies, such as dust or rings, orbiting it which cannot be found. These bodies could damage the New Horizons probe. The current plan for New Horizons is that it will pass just inside the orbit of Charon. But this could change if scientists think that the space probe will be damaged."
Physical properties.
"The moon is 10 to 25 km across. Because of its small size, it is likely to be irregular in shape. The moon is very faint, about one one-hundred-thousandth as bright as Pluto. The moon is likely to be made of water ice."
Orbital properties.
"Styx orbits the centre of mass of Pluto and Charon at a distance of around 42,000 km. This is in between the orbits of Charon and Nix. The orbital path of the moon is very nearly circular, like the other moons of Pluto. The moon orbits in the same orbital plane as the other moons. The moon takes around 20 days to orbit Pluto."
Origin.
The moon system around Pluto may exist because of a collision of Pluto with a large Kuiper belt body a very long time ago. Pluto’s moons may have formed from the scattered pieces of rock left behind after the collision.
The Doon School
"The Doon School (informally ""Doon School"" or ""Doon"") is a boys-only private boarding school in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India. The school was founded by Satish Ranjan Das, a Calcutta lawyer. Doon's first headmaster was Arthur E. Foot, a former science master at Eton College. The present headmaster is Peter McLaughlin, who has occupied the post since 2009 and is the ninth headmaster of the school."
"The school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Doon pupils take the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education in tenth grade and are thereafter offered two strands for the final two years: International Baccalaureate (IB) or Indian School Certificate (ISC). The school began offering the IB curriculum only in 2006, before which all pupils had to sit the ISC examinations in twelfth grade."
"Doon has consistently been ranked among the best residential schools of India by media such as ""The Times of India"" and ""Outlook"". Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including President Pratibha Patil, to become coeducational. Former students of the school are commonly known as ""Doscos"". Although the total number of Doscos is relatively small (estimated at 5,000 since the school's founding), they include some of India's most prominent politicians, government officials and business leaders. The best known alumnus is former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi."
Maria Muldaur
"Maria Muldaur (born in New York City, September 12, 1943) is an American singer and songwriter. Her birth name was Maria Grazia Rosa Domenica D'Amato. She is a folk-blues singer who contributed to the revival of American folk music in the early 1960s and recorded the 1974 hit song ""Midnight at the Oasis""."
"It also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which means ""fun"" (""lollig"" means ""funny""). In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say ""utter nonsense"" in Welsh, they would say ""rwtsh lol"". LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging."
Toronto
Toronto is the capital city of the province of Ontario in Canada. It is also the largest city in both Ontario and Canada. It is found on the north-west side of Lake Ontario.
"The City of Toronto itself has a population of almost 3 million people. Even more people live in the regions around it. All together, the Greater Toronto Area is home to over 6 million people. This makes it the biggest metropolitan area in Canada."
History.
"Toronto was created in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe as the capital of what was then called ""Upper Canada"". At the time it was called the ""Town of York"" after the Duke of York. The name was changed to Toronto in 1834. With the Canadian Confederation in 1867, it became the capital of the newly created province of Ontario. Toronto was one of two cities (along with Montreal in Quebec) that wanted to be the capital of Canada. Queen Victoria decided that Ottawa should be the national capital because it was located between the two."
"As the 19th century moved on, the city began to grow. This was mainly because of immigration, where people from all over the world left their home and moved to Canada. Many of the immigrants were Irish people. They brought their Catholic faith with them when they left Ireland because of the Irish Potato Famine."
"During World War I and World War II, Toronto was used to train members of the Canadian Army. After the wars, even more immigrants came to the city. The population was becoming so big that the Government of Ontario decided to create Metropolitan Toronto in 1954, combining a number of local municipalities. These were Old Toronto, York, East York, North York, Etobicoke, and Scarborough."
"By 1981, Toronto had more people than Montreal even though it was created after Montreal. Because of that, the Ontario government decided to make Toronto a ""megacity"" in 1998. The first mayor of Toronto was Mel Lastman. As Toronto moved into the 21st century, it became host to a number of worldwide events. These included World Youth Day in 2002, WorldPride in 2014, and the 2015 Pan American Games."
"On April 23, 2018 a white van collided with numerous pedestrians killing nine and injuring sixteen others at Yonge Street."
Climate.
"Toronto has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification: ""Dfa"")."
Things to see and do.
"Toronto has a humid continental climate (""Dfa"" in the Köppen climate classification). This is because although the city is next to Lake Ontario, the lake is not big enough to keep its temperature mild."
"As the biggest city in Canada and one of the biggest in all of North America, Toronto is a popular destination for tourists. It is where you can find the CN Tower, which is the tallest free-standing (not supported) structure in the Americas and one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. There are some other buildings, including the City Hall and the Rogers Centre, that are well known for their design style. There are many skyscrapers, because many large banks of Canada and other companies have their main offices in Toronto, and the Toronto Stock Exchange which is the biggest stock market in Canada."
"Because Toronto is the capital of Ontario, it is where the provincial government meets. Visitors can see how the province is run by visiting the legislature in Queen's Park. There are museums, including the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, the Ontario Science Centre, the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the headquarters of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the suburbs of the city is the Toronto Zoo and Canada's Wonderland. Many visitors also like to go to Niagara Falls, just an hour's drive away from Toronto."
"Toronto is full of places to visit, eat, shop, and enjoy. In the downtown area are shopping centres, including the Eaton Centre, St. Lawrence Market, and the Distillery District. There are several theatres, many which are run by the Mirvish family. The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, opened in June 2006, is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Across the harbor are the Toronto Islands, the best known of which is Centre Island."
"Toronto has many sports teams. Some of them belong to the most commonly-followed leagues in North America. They include the Toronto Maple Leafs in ice hockey (NHL) and the Toronto Raptors in basketball (NBA), both of which play in the Air Canada Centre. The nearby Rogers Centre is where the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team plays. BMO Field in Exhibition Place is home to the Toronto Argonauts in Canadian football and Toronto F.C., a soccer club."
"Toronto is a very multicultural city. Different people from around the world have moved to Toronto to live since the 20th century. There is a Chinatown, Little Italy, Little Tokyo, Greektown, Little Portugal, and other places where different cultures are kept alive. These people hold festivals where they share their culture with others. Among the most popular is the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), which happens every year in August."
Transport.
"Like many cities around the world, Toronto has an airport, Toronto Pearson International Airport. There are flights to many places in Canada and the rest of the world. The airport is just northwest of the city centre. Since 2015, there has been a train service, the Union Pearson Express. It goes from the airport to Downtown in less than half an hour."
"Toronto's main public transportation system is operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). The main part of its public transport network is the Toronto subway system. That system includes three heavy-rail rapid transit lines spanning the city, including the U-shaped Line 1 and east–west Line 2. A light metro line also exists, exclusively serving the eastern district of Scarborough. A discussion is underway to replace it with a heavy-rail line. The TTC also operates an extensive network of buses and streetcars. The streetcars serve the downtown core. The buses provide service to many parts of the city not served by the sparse subway network."
"The Government of Ontario also operates a commuter rail and bus transit system called GO Transit in the Greater Toronto Area. GO Transit carries over 250,000 passengers every weekday (2013) and 57 million annually. Most of them travel to or from Union Station. GO Transit is implementing RER (Regional Express Rail) into its system."

It was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. ""Kingdom Hearts III"" is the first game in the series to be released on a Microsoft platform as it was only released on both Sony and Nintendo systems."
Development.
"After years of rumors and speculation, the game was confirmed to be in development at E3 2013. Director Tetsuya Nomura said that the game will finish the ""Xehanort Saga"" but that it would not be the final game in the series."
"In a June 2013 interview with ""Famitsu"", Nomura discussed the visuals that were seen in the teaser trailer. He said that they tried to remember that the ""Kingdom Hearts characters were originally paintbrush art from Disney productions, a texture that was one of our original aims, and that it was time to return to that. So [chief creative director Takeshi] Nozue went through a series of tests, and the results are the visuals that we refer to in the team as the Kingdom Shader. It may look like a pretty drastic change, but I see it as a rich evolution of everything we've shown you up to now."" In September 2013, producer Shinji Hashimoto said that since both ""Kingdom Hearts III"" and ""Final Fantasy XV"" are being directed by Nomura, there would be a big gap between the release of the two games, ""as [they] want each game to be perfect in terms of quality."" Hashimoto repeated Nomura's statements about the game's announcement at E3 2013, and said that ""the company thought it was about time it addressed speculation about the long-awaited conclusion to the trilogy."" In October 2013, Teruzane Utada, the father of singer Hikaru Utada, said that Hikaru would once again be involved in the theme song, as she did with ""Kingdom Hearts"" and ""Kingdom Hearts II"". He later stated that it is still undecided on their involvement. In January 2014, actor Haley Joel Osment, the English voice of Sora in the series, said that he was in talks with the development team after the announcement and said that since dialogue was one of the last parts of the process, he believed he would not begin recording until mid-2014 at the earliest."
Controversy.
"After the announcement of SQUARE ENIX that there would be no French Spanish and German voice (present in the 1 and 2) European fans launched the movement # EUDubbingForKH3 which aims to change his opinion SE and he includes (real) German and Spanish French voice through petition, letter etc."
Watchman
"Watchmen were groups of men who discouraged crime and enforced the law. They were usually authorised by the state or government. Watchmen have existed in many places around the world throughout history. Today, the job of law enforcement has generally been taken over by organised police."
An early reference to a watch can be found in the Bible. Ezekiel says that it was the watchmen's duty to sound the alarm to warn the people that they were under attack (Ezekiel 33:1-6). The Roman Empire turned the role of a watchman into a profession. The Vigiles was the city watch in Rome. It was the city's police force.
"In England, the Ordinance of 1233 required the appointment of watchmen. The Assize of Arms of 1252 and the Statute of Winchester of 1285 are considered among the earliest examples of a police in England. The Assize of Arms required that constables be appointed to call men to fight when the town was under attack. It also required them to stop disturbances of the peace, and to take criminals to the sheriff. By 1415, a watch was appointed to the Parliament of England. King Henry VII appointed a watch for his house, the Tower of London, in 1485. These watchmen became known as the Beefeaters."
SpaceShipOne
"SpaceShipOne is a vehicle built to travel to the lower limits of outer space. It completed the first manned private spaceflight in 2004. That same year, it won the US$10 million Ansari X Prize and has not flown since winning. It was carried high into the air by a specially designed plane named ""White Knight"". Both vehicles were built and flown by Mojave Aerospace Ventures. This was a joint project between Paul Allen and Scaled Composites, Burt Rutan's flying machine company. Allen provided the money to build and fly SpaceShipOne, about US$25 million."
"Rutan has said that ideas about the project began as early as 1994. The full-time work towards the 2004 accomplishments took about three years. The vehicle first flew faster than the speed of sound on December 17, 2003. This date was also the one-hundredth anniversary of the Wright Brothers' historic first powered flight. SpaceShipOne's first official spaceflight, was piloted by Mike Melvill. A few days before that flight, the Mojave Air and Space Port was the first commercial spaceport licensed in the United States. A few hours after that flight, Melvill became the first licensed U.S. commercial astronaut. The overall project name was ""Tier One"". It has evolved into Tier 1b with a goal of taking a new, but similar ship's first paying passengers into space within the next few years."
"Usual prizes will be small amount of money, simple reward like pen or cup, or entry in to competition to win something."
Details.
"Web-based survey have come a long way, from 1980s where first email surveys were conducted to 1990s when initial web-based surveys were introduced. There were almost $500 million spent on web-based surveys in 2002, and According to Inside Research this number climbed up to about $960 million in 2004."
"But despite the advances in survey research, there are still many short comings and problems, such as declining response rates, limited online data bases, mistrust about survey uses (true research versus selling), survey length, issues concerning privacy and security, internet surveys being looked at as spam by some etc."
"Most of Online Surveys that are real will not pay cash, but instead give vouchers or prizes."
"Online or Internet surveys are very useful for many companies. People get rewarded for answering questions about a product, a company or any questions that will help the company to work better."
"Many companies pay people to take a survey, but some are for free."
"In era of digital surveys there is many fraud cases where user will be not paid after completing one. Some ways of avoiding fraud sites is to check them on MyWot, review sites or by simply checking their reviews on forums."
It is getting more popular to fill surveys to get access to website or valuable content.
"Another popular form of surveys that has recently emerged are daily surveys. Daily survey panels allow their members to participate in surveys everyday. The user is taken through a router where they can keep trying to qualify until a survey is found that matches their demographics. Daily surveys pay less than most paid surveys, but the opportunity to qualify is much greater and payouts are usually cash instead of prizes."
"Businesses spend $18.7 billion worldwide on market research, as reported by CASRO."

Article Three of the United States Constitution
"Article Three of the United States Constitution creates the judicial branch of the United States government. It creates the Supreme Court of the United States, and allows the United States Congress to create less powerful federal courts. It also sets out the powers that these courts have."
Section 1: Federal courts.
"Section 1 of Article Three starts out by creating the Supreme Court one court that will be more powerful than any other court in the country. It also gives Congress the power to create ""inferior"" (less powerful) federal courts."
It allows judges in these courts to get a regular salary for their work. Section 1 protects the judges by saying that their salaries will not be decreased while they are in office (working as a federal judge).
Tenure.
"Section 1 says that judges ""shall hold their Offices [keep their jobs] during good Behavior."" This is meant to protect federal judges, and also to make sure that the federal judiciary is independent."
"Before it won its independence in the American Revolutionary War, America was a colony of the British Empire. The Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution just four years after the War ended. They still remembered what the courts in the American colonies were like. As Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, Britain's King George III ""made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries."""
"This meant that the judges could not be independent or impartial. If they made a decision that King George did not like, they could be fired, or not paid. Judges who wanted to keep their jobs made decisions based on what King George would want, not based on what the law said. If judges are cannot be independent, or do not follow they law, courts are not fair, and there is no way for regular people to get justice."
"The Constitution makes sure that this will not happen to United States federal judges. By saying judges ""shall hold their Offices during good Behavior,"" Section 1 is basically allowing judges to keep their jobs for the rest of their lives. In , the Constitution does say that Congress can take away a judge's job but only after being convicted in a trial, and only for ""Treason, Bribery, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors."" (This is what Section 1 means by behavior that is not ""good."") In other words, the Constitution makes sure that all judges will lose their jobs for making even the slightest unpopular decision. This denies judges the freedom to be independent, and to make the decisions that they think are fair, and makes them choose between right and reelection."
Number of courts.
"Article III clearly allows only one Supreme Court. However, it does not say how many Supreme Court Justices (judges) there should be. Congress solved this problem in 1948 by passing a law. The law says that the Supreme Court will have 9 Justices, including one Chief Justice."
"In both Section 1 and in , the Constitution gives Congress the right to create courts that are ""inferior"" to the Supreme Court. However, the Constitution does not say how many ""inferior"" courts there should be, or how they should be set up. It leaves those decisions to Congress. Congress decided to create two different kinds of ""inferior"" courts (also called ""lower courts""). In the Judiciary Act of 1789, they created:"
"Section 2: Judicial power, jurisdiction, and trial by jury."
Clause 1: Cases and controversies.
"Clause 1 of Section 2 explains the powers the federal court has, and the limits of those powers."
"Clause 1 gives the federal courts the power to hear and judge actual ""cases and controversies"" only. For example, they cannot hear a case about a situation that might come up in the future."
Clause 2: Original and appellate jurisdiction.
"When Clause 2 talks about ""jurisdiction,"" it is talking about who has the power to hear a case."
Original jurisdiction.
"""Original jurisdiction"" is the power to hear a case first, before any other court. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in:"
Appellate jurisdiction.
"In all the other cases mentioned in Clause 2, the Supreme Court has ""appellate jurisdiction."" That means another court has the power to hear the case first. If somebody appeals that court's decision, the Supreme Court can take the case on appeal. Clause 2 gives the Supreme Court the power to hear appeals on:"
Air Supply
"Air Supply is a pop music singing group. They formed in Melbourne, Australia in 1976."
"The current members are Russell Hitchcock (born June 15, 1949 in Melbourne) and Graham Russell (born June 1, 1950 in Nottingham, England). In 1981 they got with their song ""The One That You Love"" a number one hit in the United States. They had their most popular times during the early 1980s."
Sex Pistols
"The Sex Pistols were the first popular punk group in Britain and one of the first bands to come from the rising U.K. punk scene of the late 1970s. They were only together for about 3 years, from late 1975 to early 1978, and they were known for their rowdy behaviour more than their music. The music they made gave many new artists a big influence on their music, mostly in the alternative music and punk scenes such as California punk rock group Green Day."
"The band members were Johnny Rotten (vocals), Paul Cook (drums), Steve Jones (guitar) and Glen Matlock (bass). Sid Vicious later replaced Matlock on bass in February 1977 but died 2 years later. They recorded only one studio album, called ""Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols"" during the summer of 1977. One of their most famous songs is ""Anarchy In The UK"". Another one of their most famous songs is ""God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)"", which was banned by the BBC for it's contents. They split up after a show at Winterland on January 14th, 1978, with Rotten saying ""You ever get the feelin' you're bein' cheated?"""

"The Kennedy Center honored Davis in 1987. She died of breast cancer in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France."
Gunpowder Plot
"The Gunpowder Conspiracy of 1605 was a plan to assassinate King James I of England and VI of Scotland. Other names for the plot are The Powder Treason or The Gunpowder Plot. A group of Catholics wanted to blow up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening of Parliament on 5 November 1605. This would have killed the king, and most of the Protestant aristocracy."
"The conspirators also planned to kidnap the royal children, and lead a popular revolt in the Midlands."
Origins.
"Robert Catesby led the planning of the conspiracy, which started in May 1604. The people who helped him were either rich Catholics, or gentry families who had a lot of influence. Catesby may have come up with the plot when he saw that there was little hope that Great Britain would become more tolerant to Roman Catholics, under King James I. Many Catholics were disappointed about the situation. It is more likely though that Catesby simply wanted to give the Catholics in England a chance: The plot was to be the first step of a rebellion. Afterwards, James' nine-year-old daughter (Princess Elizabeth) could be put in as a Catholic head of state."
"Other plotters were Thomas Winter (also spelled Wintour), Robert Winter, John Wright, Christopher Wright, Robert Keyes, Thomas Percy (also spelled Percye), John Grant, Ambrose Rokewood, Sir Everard Digby, Francis Tresham and Thomas Bates (Catesby's servant). The explosives were prepared by Guy ""Guido"" Fawkes, a man with 10 years military experience. Fawkes had fought with the Spanish against the Dutch in the Spanish Netherlands."
"The main Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet was said to know the details of the plot. Oswald Tesimond, a fellow Jesuit had told him. Robert Catesby confessed them to Tesimond, and gave him the permission to tell Garnet. Although he was convicted, there has since been some debate over how much Garnet really knew. As the details of the plot were known through confession, Garnet was not allowed to reveal them to the authorities. He did not think it was a good idea. Nevertheless, the plot went ahead. Garnet's opposition to it did not save him from being hanged, drawn and quartered for treason in 1606, though."
Planning.
"In the 17th century, the Palace of Westminster was made of many buildings, spread over a large area. They were grouped around the medieval chambers, chapels, and halls of the old royal palace. This palace housed both Parliament and the various law courts. The palace was also easier to access than it is today. Merchants, lawyers, and other people lived and worked on the palace grounds."
"As a member of the King's Bodyguard, Percy was able to lease rooms next to the House of Lords, in May 1604. The plotters' original idea was to dig their way under the foundations of the Lords chamber to put the gunpowder there. The main idea was to kill James, but many other important targets would be present, including most of the Protestant nobility and senior bishops of the Church of England. Guy Fawkes, as ""John Johnson"", was put in charge of this building, where he posed as Percy's servant. Catesby's house in Lambeth was used to store the gunpowder with the tools for digging."
"However, the Black Plague came back to London in the summer of 1604 and proved to be particularly severe. For this reason, the opening of Parliament was changed to 1605. By Christmas Eve, the miners had still not reached the buildings of Parliament, and just as they restarted work early in 1605, they learned that the opening of Parliament had been further postponed to 3 October. The plotters then took the opportunity to row the gunpowder up the Thames from Catesby's house in Lambeth, to hide it in their new rented house: they had learned (by chance) that a coal merchant named Ellen Bright had vacated a ground-floor undercroft directly beneath the House of Lords chamber. Presented with this golden opportunity, Percy immediately took pains to secure the lease. He created the story that his wife would join him in London and that he would need the extra storage space."
"Fawkes assisted in filling the room with gunpowder, which was hidden beneath a wood store under the House of Lords building, in a cellar leased from John Whynniard. By March 1605, they had filled the undercroft underneath the House of Lords with 36 barrels of gunpowder, hidden under a store of winter fuel. Had all 36 barrels been successfully ignited, the explosion could easily have reduced many of the buildings in the Old Palace of Westminster complex to rubble, and would have blown out windows in the surrounding area of about a one kilometre radius."
"The conspirators left London in May, and went to their homes or to different areas of the country, because being seen together would arouse suspicion. They arranged to meet again in September; however, the opening of Parliament was again postponed."
Zuni
"The Zuni, also called Zuñi or Ashiwi are a Native American tribe. They live near the Zuni River. This river flows into the Little Colorado River, in western New Mexico, United States."
"They are famous for their language, which is not like other Pueblo or Native American languages. It is a language isolate."
Fallacy
"A fallacy is an incorrect argument in logic and rhetoric. It gives a result which is not valid or lacks soundness. In mathematics, a fallacy can occur when the reasoning violates the condition of its applicability. Fallacies are either formal fallacies or informal fallacies."
Formal fallacies.
A formal fallacy is an error in logic. This shows in the argument's form. All formal fallacies are types of non sequiturs (the conclusion does not follow from the premises).
"Even if the conclusion of an argument is correct, it is not supported by the logic given."
Informal fallacies.
Informal fallacies are arguments that are fallacious for reasons other than structural flaws. They usually need examination of the argument's content. Some examples of informal fallacies include:
Faulty generalizations.
"Faulty generalizations are made when one reaches a conclusion from weak premises. Unlike fallacies of relevance, in fallacies of defective induction, the premises are related to the conclusions—yet only weakly buttress the conclusions. A faulty generalization is thus produced."
Red herring fallacies.
"A red herring fallacy is an error in logic where a proposition is, or is intended to be, misleading in order to make irrelevant or false inferences. In the general case any logical inference based on fake arguments, intended to replace the lack of real arguments or to replace implicitly the subject of the discussion."
"Red herring – argument given in response to another argument, which is irrelevant and draws attention away from the subject of argument."

Myanmar
Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia. Its full name is the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. It used to be called Burma. Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia that is not an island. It is also part of South Asia.
"It is bordered by China on the north, Laos on the east, Thailand on the southeast, Bangladesh on the west, and India on the northwest, with the Andaman Sea to the south, and the Bay of Bengal to the southwest. There are over of coastline."
Government.
"The country was ruled by a military junta led by General Ne Win from 1962 to 1988. Its political system today stays under the tight control of its military government. In 1991, Senior General Than Shwe began ruling the country. In 2011 Thein Sein was elected as a first president of the civilian government. In 2016 Htin Kyaw became the second elected civilian leader. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is prevented from becoming president by the constitution of Myanmar, will act as an advisor to Kyaw."
"In March 2018, Win Myint became the country's tenth and current President."
Origin and history of the name.
"In 1989, the military junta officially changed the English version of its name from ""Burma"" to ""Myanmar"". It also made a new name in English for places in the country, such as its former capital city, from ""Rangoon"" to Yangon. The official name of the country in the Burmese language, ""Myanmar"" did not change, however. The renaming was controversial, seen by some as linguistically bad. Accepting the name change in the English-speaking world has been slow, with many people still using the name ""Burma"" to refer to the country. Major news organizations like the BBC still call it Burma. Some question the military junta's authority to ""officially"" change the name in English in the first place. Aung San Suu Kyi, however, calls the country Myanmar now."

"Myanmar had a strong kingdom in ancient times, but the nation was taken over by the British in the 1800s. It was occupied by the Empire of Japan in the 1940s. Myanmar became independent in 1948 as the Union of Burma, and had a democratic government at first. However, in 1962, a coup d'état brought the military into power, where it has been ever since. The founder of modern Myanmar, Aung San was assassinated months before independence. His daughter Aung San Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest many times for leading the democracy movement."
"In 1991, the military junta agreed to democratic elections, which were won by the National League for Democracy, and should have made Aung San Suu Kyi the Prime Minister. However, the dictatorship ignored the results of the elections and continued ruling. In November 2005, the military government stated that the national capital would be moved from Yangon to a location near Pyinmana, which was renamed Naypyidaw in March 2006."
Entrepôt.
"An entrepôt is a port, city, or trading post where goods may be imported, stored or sold. These cities grew because of the growth of long-distance trade."
European Union
The European Union (abbreviation: EU) is a confederation of 27 member countries in Europe established by the Maastricht Treaty in 1992-1993. The EU grew out of the European Economic Community (EEC) which was established by the Treaties of Rome in 1957. It has created a common economic area with Europe-wide laws allowing the citizens of EU countries to move and trade in other EU countries almost the same as they do on their own. Nineteen of these countries also share the same type of money: the euro.
"The name of Europe comes from the Latin Europa, which in turn derives from the Greek Εὐρώπη, from εὐρύς eurys ""wide"" and ὤψ ops ""face""."
"The Treaty of Lisbon is the most recent treaty that says how the Union is run. Every member state signed to say that they each agreed with what it says. Most importantly, it says which jobs (’powers’) the Union should do for the members and which jobs they should do themselves. The members decide how the Union should act by voting for or against proposals."
"The objective of the EU is to bring its member states closer together with respect of human rights and democracy. It does this with common rules about fair trading with each other, common agreements about law enforcement, a common style of passport, and other agreements. Most members share a common currency (the euro) and most allow people to travel from one country to another without having to show a passport. It does this with common rules about fair trading with each other, common agreements about law enforcement, and other agreements. It has a common style for (its) passports."
History.
"After World War II, the countries in Europe wanted to live peacefully together and help one another's economies. Instead of fighting each other for coal and steel, the first member countries (West) Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg created one European Coal and Steel Community in 1952."
"In 1957 in the Italian city of Rome, the member countries signed another treaty and made the European Economic Community. Now it was a community for coal, steel and for trade. Later it changed the name to the European Community."
"In 1993, with the ""Treaty of Maastricht"" it changed its name to the European Union. Now the member countries work together not only in politics and economy (coal, steel and trade), but also in money, justice (laws), and foreign affairs. With the Schengen Agreement, 22 member countries of the EU opened their borders to each other, so people can now travel from one country to the other without a passport or identity card. Many of the countries of the EU also share a currency, which is called the euro. 10 new countries became members of the EU in 2004, 2 more became members in 2007, and 1 more in 2013. In 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Today there are 27 member countries altogether."
Free movement.
"A person who is a citizen of the European Union can live and work in any of the 27 member states without needing a work permit or visa. For example, a French person can move to Greece to work there, or just to live there, and he or she does not need permission from an authority in Greece."
"In the same way, products made in one member country can be sold in any other member country without any special permissions or extra taxes. For this reason, the members agree rules on product safety - they want to know that a product made in another country will be as safe as it would be if it had been made in their own."
Main institutions.
Institutions of the European Union
Council of the European Union.
"The Council of the European Union is the main decision-making group. The cabinet ministers of the member countries meet (Ministers for Foreign affairs, for Agriculture, for Justice, etc...) and discuss issues that are important to them."
"Before the Treaty of Lisbon (written in 2007, implemented in 2008) each member state takes a turn at being President of the council for six months. For example, from January 2007 until July 2007, Germany held the presidency. The six months before that, Finland held the presidency. Now the President of the European Union chairs the council summits. The President of the council is the organiser and manager and is voted into office for a duration of two and a half years. He or she does not have the power to make decisions about the European Union like the President of the United States does for that country."
"Member countries with a large population (Germany, France, United Kingdom, etc.) have more votes than countries with small populations (Luxembourg, Malta, etc.) but a decision cannot be made if enough countries vote against the decision."
"Twice a year, the heads of government (Prime Ministers) and/or the heads of state (Presidents) meet to talk about the main issues and make decisions on different issues. This meeting is different and not as formal. It is known as a European Council."
European Commission.
"The European Commission runs the day-to-day running of the EU and writes laws, like a government. Laws written by the commission are discussed and changed by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union."
"The commission has one President and 27 Commissioners, selected by the European Council. The Commission President is appointed by the European Council with the approval of the European Parliament."
"The commission operates like a cabinet government. There is one Commissioner per member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state."
European Parliament.
"The Parliament has a total of 705 members (called Members of the European Parliament, or MEP). They are elected in their countries every five years by the citizens of the European Union member countries. The Parliament can approve, reject or change proposed laws. It can also sack the European Commission. In that case, the entire commission would have to give up their jobs."
Politics.
There are many discussions in the EU about how it should develop and change in the future.
The main reasons why European countries came together are political and economic:
Member States.
Fountain Hills
"Fountain Hills is a town in the Maricopa County of Arizona. It is close to Phoenix and Scottsdale. Fountain Hills has the 4th largest fountain in the world, which goes off every hour for 15 minutes. The general entertainment consists in the local high school sporting events."
Yu-Gi-Oh! (trading card game)
"The ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" Trading Card Game is a Japanese-American card game developed and published by Konami. It is based on the fictional game of ""Duel Monsters"", which is the main story for the anime series ""Yu-Gi-Oh!"". It is played around the world, but mostly in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia. It was first sold to the public in 1999. In 2009 it broke the world record for most trading cards sold."
"""Yu-Gi-Oh!"" is a trading card game in which players draw cards from separate decks and take turns playing cards. The game is like a battle, and the cards have different uses to help the player win the battle. There is one deck of cards for each player. Each deck contains 40 to 60 cards. Each player also has an optional ""extra deck"" of up to 15 cards that are used in certain situations. There is also a 15-card ""side deck"", which allows players to modify their deck between games. Players are only allowed three of the same card per deck and side deck. Each player starts with a certain number of ""Life Points"". To win the game, a player has to reduce their opponent's Life Points to zero. This is usually achieved by using ""monster"" cards to attack the monster cards of the opponent or damage the opponent's life points. The other two card types are ""spells"" and ""traps"". There are many, many types of spells and traps. For example, these cards' effects may eliminate an opponent's card, counter the effects of an opponent's card, or retrieve a specific card from one's own deck, to name just a few. Most monster cards also have extra abilities of their own."
Weston-on-Trent
Weston-on-Trent is a village and parish in Derbyshire. It is to the north of the River Trent. At the 2004 census there were about 800 people in the village aged sixteen to seventy-four years.
"In 1009 Æþelræd Unræd (King Ethelred the Unready) signed a document which agreed the size of Weston. The document shows that Weston owned the crossings of the River Trent. These crossings were for one of the roads going up or down England. The land was at Weston upon Trent and at Morley, Smalley, Ingleby, Crich and Kidsley. This land was given to Morcar, the King's chief minister. Morcar could decide a person's life or death without the King."
Kalmykia
"Republic of Kalmykia (, Kalmyk: ) the subject of the Russian Federation, is a part of Southern federal district. It is formed on November, 4th, 1920."
Capital — Elista.
"Borders in the south on Stavropol Territory, in the southeast — with Republic Dagestan, in the north — with the Volgograd region, in the northeast — with the Astrakhan region, in the west — with the Rostov region."
Geographical position.
"The republic Kalmykia places in the extreme southeast of the European part of Russia. Extent of territory from the north on the south — 448 km, from the West on the east — 423 km."
"The region is possessed in zones of steppes, semi-deserts and deserts and takes territory with a total area of 75,9 thousand in km ² that there is more than territory of such states in the Western Europe as Belgium, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The republic is in the southeast of the European part of the Russian Federation. Its co-ordinates constitute 44°50 ' and 40°10 ' east longitude both 41°40 ' and 47°35 ' northern width."
"Three prirodno-economic zones are conditionally allocated for territories of Kalmykia: western, central and east. The western zone covers territories of Gorodovikovsky and Jashaltinsky areas, the central zone — territories of Maloderbetovsky, Sarpinsky, Ketchenerovsky, Virgin, Prijutnensky and Iki-Burulsky areas, east — territories October, Justinsky, Jashkulsky, Chernozemelsky, Lagansky * Dolbansky and Limansky areas. Most favourable on it is soil-environmental conditions the western zone is."
Rather large specific territory of east zone are the so-called Black earths.
"From the south the territory of Kalmykia is limited by Kumo-Manychskoj a hollow and the rivers Manych and Kuma, in a southeast part is washed by Caspian sea, in the northeast on an insignificant plot the republic border approaches to the river Volga, and in the northwest the Ergeninsky height is possessed. Within republic territory northern part of Near-Caspian lowland is called Sarpinsky lowland, and in its southern part there are Black earths. Dominating type of a relief of the republic, the large part of its territory, plains are taking."
Minerals.
"There are stocks of hydrocarbons, the basic reconnoitered and maintained — Iki-Burulsky and Ermolinsky nonassociated gas fields. Deposits concern to near-Caspian gas-oil provinces."
Climate.
"Republic climate sharply continental — summer hot and very dry, winter is snowless, sometimes with the big colds. Continentality of a climate essentially amplifies from the West on the east. Average temperatures of January on all republic the negative: from −7 °C …-9 °C in southern and its southwest part to −10 °C … −12 °C in the north, the minimum temperature of January: −35 °C … −37 °C. The lowest temperatures sometimes reach −35 °C and more low in northern areas. Feature of a climate is significant duration of solar light which constitutes 2180–2250 hours (182–186 days) per a year. Duration of the warm period constitutes 240–275 days. Average temperatures of July constitute +23,5 °C … +25,5 °C. The absolute maximum of temperature in hot reaches year +40 °C … +44 °C."
"Air rise in temperature is observed from the north on the south and the southeast of territory of republic. During the winter period there is thaw, in separate days — blizzards, and sometimes formed ice aggrieves to agriculture, causing an icing of herbage of pastures and winter crops."
"Specific feature of territory of republic are droughts and dry winds: happen to 120 суховейных days in the summer. The region is the most droughty in the south of the European part of Russia. The annual amount of precipitation constitutes 210–340 mm. On conditions влагообеспеченности in republic four basic agroclimatic areas are allocated: very dry, dry, very droughty, droughty."
"Thanks to prevalence of zones of strong winds the region has significant wind energy resources, realised only at a rate of 3-5 million kvt·h/year on Kalmyk Wind Electrostation."
Nature.
In republic territory live about 60 species of mammals. On reservoirs of Kalmykia nest about 130 kinds of birds and more than 50 kinds meet during seasonal migrations. 20 kinds of reptiles and 3 kinds of the amphibious. Within republic 23 kinds of the birds brought in the Red book of the Russian Federation are noted.
Number of population of a saiga fluctuates from 270 thousand to 400 thousand goals
"Slug is a general term for a gastropod mollusc which has no shell, or just a small internal shell."
"Slugs belong to several different families which also include snails with shells. Snails are gastropods with a coiled shell large enough for the animal to pull back inside. The families of land slugs are not very closely related, despite looking similar. The shell-less slug type is an example of convergent evolution, and so the category ""slug"" is not a taxonomic category."
"The name ""slug"" is used for air-breathing land slugs, while the marine forms are usually known as sea slugs. Land gastropods with a shell that is too small to hide the body are sometimes called ""semislugs""."
Body parts and behaviour.
"Like land snails, most slugs have four 'feelers' or ""tentacles"" on their head. The upper two (the ""optical tentacles"") see light and have eyespots at the ends, while the lower two (the ""sensory tentacles"") are used for smelling. The tentacles are retractable, and can regrow if lost."
"On top of the slug, behind the head, is a body part called the ""mantle,"" and under this are the genital opening and anus. On one side (almost always the right side) of the mantle is a breathing hole, which is easy to see when open, but difficult to see when closed. Inside the mantle in some species is a very small, flat shell."
"The bottom of a snail is called a ""foot"". Like other snails, a slug moves by rhythmic waves of muscle contraction on the bottom of its foot. At the same time, it secretes a layer of mucus on which it travels, which helps prevent damage to the foot. Around the edge of the foot is the 'foot fringe'."
"Some slug species hibernate underground during the winter in places with cold winters, but in other species, the adults die in the autumn."
Ruwer
Ruwer could mean:
Ruwer (municipality)
"Ruwer is a municipality (a convention community called ""Verbandsgemeinde"" Ruwer) on the River Ruwer. The administrative offices are in the town of Waldrach, and it should not be confused with the nearby town of Ruwer, which is for administrative purposes a part of the city of Trier."
Gunpowder
"Gunpowder (or gun powder) is a mix of chemical substances (75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal and 10% sulfur). It is used primarily in firearms, burns very quickly, and creates gases. Those gases use up more space than the gunpowder they come from, so they push outward. If the gunpowder is in a small space, the gases will push on the walls of the space, building up pressure. In a gun, the pressure pushes against a bullet, causing it to fly out at high speeds. If the pressure became too high, it could destroy the gun barrel."
"Gunpowder was invented by the Chinese. The first references of black powder, the original form of gunpowder, date to the 9th century. According to legend, Chinese alchemists were looking for a formula to create the elixir of life, or the mythical potion that causes whoever drinks it to become immortal, when they accidentally created gunpowder. Because the powder was highly flammable, or burned very easily, they decided to call it ""fire medicine"" (Simplified Chinese: 火药 / Traditional Chinese: 火藥). The Chinese soon weaponized the substance, or made weapons out of it. In later centuries they made many weapons using gunpowder, including rockets, bombs, flamethrowers, and land mines, before making cannons and guns. The oldest weapon that uses gunpowder dates back to a bronze handheld cannon made in northeastern China in 1288. The first mention in Europe was in the 13th century when Roger Bacon described the formula of black powder. Gunpowder was extremely valuable to the Chinese civilization, in fact so valuable that sometimes it was traded for gold."
Mayor
"A mayor is a person who is in charge of the administration of a city. Some mayors are elected by the people who live in that city. For other cities, a central government body may choose the mayor. Some large cities have a Lord Mayor."
In federal countries like Germany the mayor can also be head of the government of a city state. The Mayor of Hamburg runs the government just like the Minister President of Bavaria runs the Bavarian government. In some big cities such as Tokyo the Mayor is a Governor.
"In many countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, the mayor is not in charge of the daily functions of a city or town. That job is done by a Town Clerk or Chief Executive, who is appointed to a full-time paid job. The mayor works part-time, usually without payment, and represents the city at events and civic functions."
Churning of the Ocean
"Churning of the Ocean is a mythical story of Hinduism and Hindu mythology. It is described in many Hindu scriptures, especially in the Mahabharata and the Puranas. The story tells about the churning of the ocean by the gods and the demons. From this churning of the ocean, several things came out of the ocean. Some of them were:"
The Hindu scriptures and the Hindu mythology tell that all the above things came out of the ocean for the good of human beings.
Martha Washington
"Martha Dandridge Custis Washington (June 2, 1731 – May 2, 1802) was the wife of George Washington, the first President of the United States. Although people only started using the term decades after her death, Martha Washington is considered to be the first First Lady of the United States."
Early life.
"She was born on June 2, 1731, at Chestnut Grove Plantation near Williamsburg, Virginia. Her parents were John Dandridge, an immigrant from England, and his wife Frances Jones. Her education consisted of the womanly arts such as needlework and playing musical instruments. Later in life, she would learn to manage a plantation."
"The Sega 32X was an attempt to top the graphics of the Super Nintendo in the 90's. Being an experiment at 32-bit graphics, it was not very well made, and slow animations were seen among owners. The 32X later died, but Sega didn't stop there. Later, they made CD32X games, which required both the 32X and CD."
Sega Saturn 1994-2000.
"Sega Saturn was released on November 22/10, 1997/1999 in Japan/France. It was the first Sega video game console with 3D graphics. Sega released two versions of the Saturn : the first generation was black and with small controllers, and the second was white. One of its most popular games was Sonic R."
Sega Dreamcast 1998-2001.
"Sega Dreamcast (; originally called ""Dural,"" and ""Katana"") is the last machine made by Sega that can play video games. It was sold before the PlayStation 2, GameCube, or Xbox came out. However, not many people bought it after the PlayStation 2 was released, so in the end Sega decided to stop making them."

Notes
Primary school
"A primary school, elementary school or grade school is a school for children between the ages of about five and eleven. It comes after preschool. When children finish learning at primary school, they go to secondary school."
"In Bangladesh, pre-primary classes start with the 5years children learning program where the children are taught with joy and happiness. Students from ages six to eleven, they finish learning from primary school and prepared for secondary."
"In the United Kingdom, a primary school usually comprises a nursery and the first seven years of a child's full-time learning. In Australia and the United States, primary school begins with kindergarten. It lasts for six years, usually until the fifth or sixth grade. In the U.S., ""elementary school"" is a more common term for public primary schools. ""Primary school"" is often used in private or independent schools. (In private or independent schools the government does not give the schools money.)"
"In India, ""Primary Education"" means the 'Nursery', the 'Kindergarten' and four years of regular schooling thereafter. Admission to Nursery classes is for children above two years so that the age is 6+ when entering Class I. Children are taught language (mother tongue and English) reading/writing skills, basic arithmetic and quite a good amount of general information about the country, people, statesmen, great people, flora &amp; animals. However, this is true only for schools in the urban areas. Rural schools do not have Nursery or Kindergarten; they admit straight at Class I when the child is six. Further, the rural schools use the mother tongue as medium of instruction, not resorting to English in any way. Primary education is free in government schools. Moreover, rural primary schools offer free mid-day meals to children (the government pays for it) so that the drop out rate comes down. States of West Bengal, Maharashtra, Manipur, Nagaland and Kerala have done very good work in this way of spreading primary education."
"In Singapore, primary school refers to those students who are normally between the ages of 7 to 12. Primary School is classified as P1 to P6 for Primary 1 to Primary 6 respectively. At the end of P6, students sit for a national level Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE) which is used for placement into Secondary School. Prior to Primary School, pupils attend Kindergarten School for 2 years."
"In Germany, the primary school is called ""Grundschule"" and is normally from first grade to fourth grade so it is usually for children who are between six and ten years old. In some eastern states, for example in Berlin, the Primary School is for children up to age 12. In most German states the children start learning English in third grade on a very low level, they learn how to count and the names of the colors and other easy things. But because of that low level a German child who has finished Primary School is normally not able to form correct English sentences. In Primary School the children are prepared for the secondary education. Primary School students attend three main subjects: Math, German and General Knowledge (""Sachkunde""). In General Knowledge the children learn about nature, about their own body, how to ride a bicycle safely and something about the city they live in and of course about Germany. Beside those main subjects the children attend subjects like arts, music and Physical Education."
Restaurant
"A restaurant (sometimes known as a diner) is a place where cooked food is sold to the public, and where people sit down to eat it. It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal."
"Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have the same name and serve the same food. McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut are examples of chain restaurants that are all over the world. These restaurants serve fast food, that is, inexpensive food, prepared and served quickly. At some, you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called drive-throughs."
There are also chain restaurants that serve slightly more expensive food. They are called fast casual restaurants. Applebee's and Perkins are examples of this type of chain restaurant.
"Haute cuisine or 'fine dining' is found in a guide, such as the ""Michelin Guide"", the most famous restaurant guide in the world. Their 3-star rosettes are given only to restaurants with the highest standards of cooking and service. Interestingly, the Guide gives more 3-stars to Tokyo and Kyoto than to Paris, London and New York together. Traditionally, the restaurants of top hotels such as the Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo or the Hôtel Ritz Paris were the main places recognized for fine dining. Today, most Michelin Guide restaurants are separate establishments."
Ancient history.
"In Ancient Greece and Rome there were small restaurant-bars offering food and drinks. They were called ""thermopolia"" (singular ""thermopolium""). Many dwellings did not have kitchens, and eating out was an important part of socializing."
"In Pompeii, 158 ""thermopolia"" with service counters have been found. They were along the main road of the town and round the public spaces."
Skimmed milk
"Skimmed milk (United Kingdom), or skim milk (United States of America) is made when all the cream (also called ""milkfat"") is removed from whole milk. Sometimes, only half the cream is removed, resulting in semi-skimmed milk instead."
"Skimmed milk is more popular in the United States than Britain. It contains less fat than whole milk, some nutritionists and doctors recommend it for people who are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight."
In the UK milk is marketed and labelled as follows:
In the USA milk is marketed primarily by fat content and available in these varieties:
Low-fat milk
has sufficient milk fat removed to bring the levels between 0.5-2 %
"Software came on ROM cartridges. It has a membrane keyboard, 2 KiB of RAM and 0.5 KiB of color RAM (1024 × 4 bits). A television is used as a display. The Commodore 64 has the same chipset, 6510 CPU and SID sound chip, and has a compatibility mode, which was often used for ""freezer"" cartridges, such as the Action Replay, to easily allow control of the running program. Tape drives (for storage) worked, but not disk drives, printers or modems due to not having the right serial and user ports."
Business.
"It was going to cost about 200 USD. It had better graphics and sound, but Commodore's own VIC-20 was much more popular. It was costing about the same and with much more expandability and software titles. It also had a better keyboard."

Plot.
"Gopal, Madhav, Lucky, Laxman and Laxman 2 are orphans in an orphanage in Ooty managed by businessman Jamnadas. Gopal is afraid of ghosts. Lucky is mute and Laxman has a speech impediment. The boys find a baby girl and take her in, naming her Khushi. They care for her and are also aware of librarian Anna's ability to see ghosts and spirits. One day, when Madhav pranks and scares the timid Gopal in an empty bungalow, a fight ensues between the boys. Gopal gets punished, which prompts Gopal and Laxman to leave the orphanage, and soon, Madhav, Lucky and Laxman also do the same. Khushi is later adopted by the loving Colonel Chauhan and his wife."
Years later.
"Some years later, Gopal and Laxman work with Babli Bhai and Madhav, Lucky and Laxman work with Vasooli Bhai. The group reunites after learning about Jamnadas' demise. Returning to the orphanage after 25 years, they meet Col. Chauhan, Anna and Pappi, another orphan from the orphanage who has frequent memory loss. They meet a girl who they think is the bungalow's caretaker, Damini and learn about Khushi's demise. At an event after Jamnadas' funeral, businessman Vasu Reddy reveals the orphanage would be demolished and moved elsewhere in plans to make his own building. When the group leaves the orphanage and returns, a ghost possesses Laxman and speak in Nana Patekar's voice which scares Gopal. Next, the ghost possesses Madhav and prompts Vasooli to give them a task, indirectly bringing the three back to Ooty. A scared Gopal calls Anna, who reveals that there is a spirit in their house and suggests him and Laxman to move to Col. Chauhan's house. Upon reaching Ooty, the two groups start fighting each other out of anger. The three try to scare Gopal into leaving the house, but Gopal gets possessed and beats Lucky and Laxman badly. Later, Vasu Reddy assigns Madhav, Lucky and Laxman to burn down the house. But things go awry when Lucky gets possessed by the spirit and starts talking, which scares the group. The two groups then decide to leave, but Anna and Damini convince them to stay for the birthday celebration, and the group makes amends. The four find that Gopal has fallen in love with Damini and force him to confess his feelings. Pappi arrives and reveals that the girl they assumed to be Damini is actually Khushi, who is dead, while the real Damini is Pappi's girlfriend. The boys get terrified and try to escape the house along with Pappi, Babli Bhai and Vasooli Bhai after Damini confesses it herself. Anna arrives and stops them and explains to them that the ghost is none other than their childhood friend Khushi."
Flashback.
"A flashback narrated by Khushi explains how her boyfriend, Nikhil Surana, a young businessman and Jamnadas' nephew, killed him in order to obtain the orphanage in his name and demolish it for the construction of a site. Upon confronting him and threatening to go to the police, Khushi was strangled to death by Nikhil. With the help of Vasu Reddy, he managed to prove the killings to be accidents. However, Khushi's spirit came for help to Anna, who was surprised that the boys could see Khushi and eventually brought them to the house to help get justice for Khushi."
Back to the present.
"Back to the present, Gopal thrashes the goons sent by Vasu Reddy while the rest of the boys, who wanted to stay away from the matter, get emotionally convinced to stay. They convince Gopal to stop chasing the goons and later almost manage to scare Vasu into confessing the truth, but Nikhil arrives before they can and reveals there's no evidence to prove him guilty. This leads to a fight, during which Khushi attacks and nearly kills Nikhil but is calmed down by Anna, and Vasu convinces Nikhil to confess. With the orphanage saved, Khushi's spirit departs to heaven after bidding goodbye to the boys and Anna."
Sequel.
"On November 7, 2021, Rohit announced that the fifth film of Golmaal series will be called Phir Golmaal. He also announced on that same day that it will be about Gopal, Madhav, Laxman, Lucky, and their new friend, who is named Vicky solving a case of them being accused of a murder as they keep on getting into trouble while solving it."
Phir Golmaal
"Phir Golmaal () is an upcoming Indian Hindi-language comedy movie that is the sequel to Golmaal Again. It will release in December 2023. It stars Ajay Devgn, Kareena Kapoor, Arshad Warsi, and Sharman Joshi.

These languages were spread around the world in the Colonial Era. English is now spoken by around 400 million people natively.
Branches.
There are three branches of West Germanic languages:
Germanic languages
"The Germanic languages are a group of Indo-European languages. They came from one language, Proto-Germanic, which was first spoken in Scandinavia in the Iron Age. Today, the Germanic languages are spoken by around 515 million people as a first language. English is the most spoken Germanic language, with 360-400 million native speakers."
"The Germanic languages are the East Germanic languages (all extinct), the North Germanic languages, and the West Germanic languages."
"When Proto-Germanic split from Proto-Indo-European, one of the main changes in the sounds in the language was Grimm’s law."
Punjabi
Punjabi might mean:
Killer whale
"Killer whales, or Orcas (""Orcinus orca"") are the largest dolphins. They have black skin with white patches. They are found in all the world's oceans, from the cold of the Arctic to the tropical seas. They live in pods, which are family groups."
Lifestyle.
"Like all toothed whales, they are carnivores. Killer whales are apex predators and they hunt in family groups called 'pods'. Members of the pod work together to surround their prey. Killer whales eat many different kinds of prey, such as small sharks, seals, sea lions, dolphins, whales, penguins, seagulls, squid, octopuses, stingrays, crabs and sea turtles. In 1997, the first known killer whale attack on great white sharks was documented off the coast of San Francisco. There are several different types of ""Orca"", each of which has different living and prey habits. They do not interbreed and seems to be subspecies or even separate species. Their behaviour and hunting techniques also differ."
"Killer whales are the largest living members of the dolphin family. Males (called ""bulls"") typically range from 6 to 8 metres long and weigh in excess of 6 tonnes. Females (""cows"") are smaller, generally ranging from 5 to 7m and weighing about 3 to 4 t. The largest male killer whale on record was 9.8 metres, weighing over 10 tonnes, while the largest female was 8.5m, weighing 7.5 t. A baby killer whale is called a ""calf"". Calves at birth weigh about and are about long. The killer whale's large size and strength make it among the fastest marine mammals, able to reach speeds in excess of ."
Intelligence.
"Killer whales have the second-heaviest brains among marine mammals. They can be trained in captivity and are often described as intelligent, although defining and measuring ""intelligence"" is difficult in a species whose life is very different from ours."
"Killer whales imitate others, and seem to deliberately teach skills to their young. This is most strikingly seen when killer whales deliberately beach themselves to catch seals. Off Península Valdés, adults sometimes pull seals off the shoreline and then release them again near juvenile whales, allowing the younger whales to practice the difficult capture technique on the now-weakened prey. Off the Crozet Islands, mothers push their calves onto the beach, waiting to pull the youngster back if needed. Some orcas have discovered that flipping sharks upside down can paralyze them."
"People who have interacted closely with killer whales offer numerous anecdotes demonstrating the whales' curiosity, playfulness, and ability to solve problems. For example, Alaskan killer whales have not only learned how to steal fish from longlines, but have overcome a variety of techniques designed to stop them, such as the use of unbaited lines as decoys. Once, fishermen placed their boats several miles apart, taking turns retrieving small amounts of their catch, in the hope that the whales would not have enough time to move between boats to steal fish as it was being retrieved. A researcher described what happened next:"
"In other anecdotes, researchers describe incidents in which wild killer whales playfully tease humans by repeatedly moving objects that the humans are trying to reach, or suddenly start to toss around a chunk of ice after a human throws a snowball."
The killer whale's use of dialects and the passing of other learned behaviours from generation to generation have been described as a form of culture.
The dorsal fin.
"The dorsal fin of the orca can extend up to six feet above its body. That's taller than most grown men. And because a killer whale swims close to the surface, the dorsal fin can often be seen gliding through the surface of the water. This causes some people to mistake killer whale for sharks. In captivity, dorsal fins often collapse for many reasons, but in the wild, dorsal fin collapse happens in less than one percent of wild orcas."
Temperament.
"Female killer whales are often tamed and can be trained to do tricks for audiences in marine shows, like in . Sometimes, killer whales have even starred in movies, such as the movie titled ""Free Willy"". Orcas can be dangerous, and have been known to kill their attendants on rare occasions. Some marine parks now require trainers to stay outside the pool when they work with orcas. Unlike wild killer whales, captive killer whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, some of which have been fatal."
"There is a population which lives near Spain and Portugal and which has specialized on attacking sailboats. They do not attack powerboats. This behaviour is mystery, as the whales cannot use glassfibre as a food. Most likely the whales practice attacking large sharks and whales, as the underside of a sailing boat resembles a large whale or a shark. They have damaged several boats, but so far none has sunk and no humans have died on their attacks."
Pac-Man
"Pac-Man is an arcade video game that was made by Namco and designed by Toru Iwatani. It was released in 1980, and became very popular in the history of games."
"In ""Pac-Man"", the player makes a Pac-Man, a yellow disc, move around a maze. The ghosts are Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. The goal is to eat every yellow pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters. For extra points, fruits that appear can also be eaten. When Pac-Man eats a big pellet, the ghosts turn blue for a short period of time and can be eaten. The time that the ghosts are blue generally decreases from one stage to the next. Beginning at stage 19, the ghosts do not turn blue at all when a power pellet is eaten. Even though the game has 256 stages, the last level can not be finished due to a problem with the creation of the game."
Plot.
"After killing GLaDOS and escaping Aperture Science Laboratories, Chell, the protagonist of ""Portal"", is taken back to the labs and placed in suspended animation for many years. While she sleeps, the laboratories become more and more run down, because no one is there to take care of them. Once she wakes up, a small, dim-witted robot, known as a core, named Wheatley tries to help her escape the building. In the process, he accidentally reactivates GLaDOS, who, still angry with Chell for killing her, forces Chell to perform tests similar to the ones she performed in ""Portal""."
"While Chell solves the puzzles and GLaDOS repairs the building, Wheatley works behind the scenes to free Chell. Once he does, they try to sabotage GLaDOS's weapons, including her turrets and neurotoxin. In a confrontation with GLaDOS, Chell presses a button that removes GLaDOS from controlling the laboratory and puts Wheatley in her place. In anger, GLaDOS reveals that Wheatley is an intelligence-dampening sphere, created by scientists to distract GLaDOS from evil by distracting her with a constant stream of stupid ideas. Wheatley is outraged and becomes power-mad. He puts GLaDOS's AI into a potato and turns on Chell, sending them both deep underground to an abandoned part of the facility."
"Chell and GLaDOS end up in the ruins of Aperture Science Laboratories, started in the 1950s. While exploring the area, recorded messages by Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson and his secretary Caroline tell the history of the company and explain the many dangerous tests performed there. As Chell moves further up in the labs, time moves forward as well, into the 1970s. Cave reveals that the company is bankrupt and must use homeless people as test subjects rather than the astronauts and Olympic athletes they had used before. Here Chell reunites with GLaDOS, whom she places on her portal gun and carries with her."
"As they move forward, GLaDOS begins to repeat things that Caroline says and becomes confused. When they move into part of the lab that was used during the 1980s, a message from Cave says he has gotten cancer from working with moon dust and he is dying. After a rant about the unfairness of life, he says that he wants Caroline to run the company after he dies. GLaDOS comes up with a plan to destroy Wheatley once they find him."
"Chell and GLaDOS make it to the Enrichment Center near the surface and find Wheatley. GLaDOS attempts to short-circuit him by telling him a paradox. Unfortunately, Wheatley is not smart enough to understand it and the plan fails. Wheatley has discovered his new body gives him a feeling of euphoria when a subject solves a test. He tried to make cubes with legs to solve puzzles, but they were not good at it. Instead, he forces Chell to solve puzzles. As she solves more tests, Wheatley's feelings of euphoria become weaker, so he builds more and more complicated tests by smashing together test chambers that GLaDOS built."
"When Wheatley cannot get the result he wants from the tests, he decides to kill Chell and GLaDOS. They escape and eventually find him, leading to the final fight. GLaDOS helps Chell attach broken personality cores to Wheatley to weaken him and she tries to press the button that switched GLaDOS and Wheatley in the first place. When she is unable to, she shoots a portal on the floor below Wheatley and another on the moon, which can be seen through a hole in the roof. Wheatley is pulled from GLaDOS's body and released into space. Chell is almost pulled out too, but GLaDOS saves her and closes the portals."
"After saving Chell, GLaDOS speaks kindly to her, explaining that when she was created, she was given part of Caroline's personality. She thanks Chell for helping her find where Caroline's personality is in her ""brain"", then deletes it. Returning to her former self, GLaDOS tells Chell that she is too difficult to kill so she will stop trying and release her instead. Chell is sent to the surface by an elevator while the turrets sing opera. Once she makes it out, the Companion Cube is thrown at her, and she is free to go. As the credits roll, GLaDOS sings the song ""Want You Gone""."
Thriller (genre)
"A thriller is a genre found in literature, movies and television. It uses suspense, where the audience is made to wonder what is going to happen next. Thrillers often have a horror or crime theme. Some examples of thriller movies are ""Psycho"", ""Silence of the Lambs"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", ""Argo"" and ""The Birds""."
Over the Limit (2011)
"Over the Limit (2011) is a future professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event to be made by WWE, which will happen on May 22, 2011 at the KeyArena in Seattle, Washington. It will be the second Over the Limit event."
Background.
Raw matches.
"The main event for the Raw side of the PPV was determined on the May 9 edition of Raw. The Miz, Alberto Del Rio and Rey Mysterio faced off in a triple threat match where the winner would face John Cena for the WWE Championship at Over the Limit. The Miz won the match by rolling up Mysterio. After the match was over, as had been announced, Cena come out to announce what type of match he had chosen. He tole the Miz, if he wants his title back, it's simple, you only ""have to make me say two words"", thus he announced the match would be an ""I Quit"" match."
"Also on Raw, carrying over from their WrestleMania and Extreme Rules matches, Jerry Lawler challenged Michael Cole to one final match at Over the Limit, where if he lost he would personally induct Cole in to the WWE Hall of Fame and give him his Hall of Fame ring. Cole initially said no and started bragging about his Mothers Day with his mother the day before in front of Lawler, whose mother died in February. This prompted King to try and attack Cole who was in his ""Cole Mine"" (a Plexiglas box meant to protect Cole from Lawler). As King went to attack, he was attacked from behind by Cole's mentor Jack Swagger. A little later in the show, Lawler came back out and attacked Cole through the holes cut in the ""Cole Mine"" by yanking Cole's head repeatedly against the plexiglas by his tie. After he was saved, Swagger accepted the match against Lawler on behalf of Cole, much to Cole's displeasure."
Balkan Wars
The Balkan Wars were a series of wars fought in the Balkan Peninsula in 1912 (First Balkan War) and 1913 (Second Balkan War).
"The First Balkan War was fought by Greece, Serbia, Montenegro and Bulgaria (the Balkan League) against the Ottoman Empire. The main objective of the Balkan League was to annex the European territories of the Ottoman Empire, because large numbers of the people of the Balkan League lived under Ottoman rule. The war was a success and the Ottoman Empire lost almost its entire European territories."
"The Second Balkan War was fought by Greece, Serbia, the Ottoman Empire and Romania against Bulgaria. Because Bulgaria felt that Greece and Serbia got more lands than they deserved, Bulgaria declared war on Greece and Serbia, which repelled the attacks. The Ottoman Empire and Romania declared war on Bulgaria, because they wanted to gain Bulgarian territories, and by the end of the Second Balkan War Bulgaria had lost almost all its gains from the First Balkan War."
"The Balkan Wars resulted in huge casualties. The Bulgarians lost around 65,000 men, the Greeks 9,500, the Montenegrins, 3,000, and the Serbs at least 36,000. The Ottomans lost as many as 125,000 dead. In addition, tens of thousands of civilians died from disease and other causes."
"After the Treaty of Istanbul in 1913, a population exchange was made by the Ottoman Empire with the Kingdom of Bulgaria, 9714 Muslim's (Turks and Xoraxane Roma) from Haskovo in North Thrace, was expelled to Ottoman Empire, and 9472 Orthodox Christian Bulgarian from Edirne in East Thrace was expelled to Kingdom of Bulgaria."
"Derecho and tornado outbreak of April 4–5, 2011"
"The April 2011 derecho and tornado outbreak was a large scale event where tornadoes and derechoes, or widespread straight-line winds, damaged parts of 3 states resulting in 9 fatalities. The event happened from April 4 to April 5th."
History.
"On April 3, supercells formed in Illinois, and a squall line of severe thunderstorms formed in Iowa. The severe thunderstorms made large hail, and strong wind, and potentially tornadoes. Then, heavy rain formed west of the severe thunderstorms but the line kept producing severe weather. On April 4, the supercells also turned into a squall line of severe thunderstorms. The storms produced tornadoes. Then, supercells formed in Tennessee and produced tornadoes. By the night of April 4, the 2 lines of storms collided and moved East. By April 5, the severe thunderstorms were in New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida and moved out to sea. The storm produced a lot of tornadoes. Plenty of severe thunderstorm and tornado watches and warnings were issued."
Impacts.
Illinois.
Court
"A court, in law, is a part of the government in which people come together to decide how to apply the country's laws to a specific situation, especially when there is an argument over how to apply the law. Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is guilty of a crime, who is the legal owner of property, or who the children of two divorced parents should live with. A court is usually in a special building called a courthouse."
"Most countries have multiple courts to deal with different issues. For example, civil courts deal with private disputes between people or organizations, while criminal courts deal with people who have been accused of crimes."
Appellate courts.
"An appellate court is one that can change a decision made by a lower court. This is called court hierarchy. The decision made by a low court can be appealed to a higher one, asking the higher court to change the decision. Higher courts usually have more experienced judges in charge. The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest court in that country."
Constitutional courts.
Some countries have a constitutional court. These courts decide if a law is in agreement with the constitution of the country.
Punishments.
"Courts usually set the punishments for breaking the law. Common punishments include paying fines and spending time in prison. In some countries, courts have the power to sentence people to death (the death penalty)."
Birth
"Birth (to be born) means when a baby animal comes out of its egg, or out of its mother after pregnancy. It is sometimes thought of as the beginning of life. It is also known as calving in livestock or whelping in meat-eating mammals."
Changes in pelvis during human pregnancy.
"In adult females the pelvis is shaped differently from males. The differences are connected with allowing the baby to pass through the birth canal successfully. Also, during pregnancy, a hormone called relaxin softens the ligaments in the pelvis area. This produces a little bit of extra space for the baby's head to get through. The process is hard to describe in words, but fortunately there is an excellent video which explains what goes on."
Pollution
"Pollution is when harmful substances are added to the environment and then change it in a bad way. There are five kinds of pollution of the environment: water pollution, air pollution, noise pollution, soil pollution and thermal pollution."
"As pollution grows, ways to combat it have been in demand. Solar energy and wind energy give people clean opportunities to power their homes. But these may also have environmental issues depending on the situation. When people use these alternative forms of energy, they put less carbon dioxide into the environment."
Water pollution.
"Water pollution is the presence of harmful materials in water, such as sewage, dissolved metal, waste from farms, factories and crude oil spilled from oil tankers. The three main substances that pollute water are nitrates from fertilizers, sewage and detergents."
"Activities such as bathing and washing clothes near lakes, ponds or rivers add nutrients like nitrate and phosphate into the water bodies.This leads to excessive growth of algae on the surface of water. It blocks the penetration of sunlight and air, thus reducing oxygen."
"It causes harm to organisms living in water and can also harm people's health. In extreme cases, it may cause diseases like cancer. It also leads to loss of a large amount of aquatic life."
Epidemic diseases.
"Water pollution has been a problem from the time human population increased, and live in cities. Cities have been prone to cholera and typhoid fever and other infectious diseases since Roman times. Existing water systems put in place in the 19th century are overwhelmed by the rapid growth of population in cities."
Air pollution.
"Air can be polluted by many things. Examples include poisonous gases, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and very small particulates. Smoke and harmful gases released by fires, industries, and thermal power plants cause air pollution. Using coal and wood as fuels for fire causes a lot of air pollution. Petroleum produces less pollution per ton, but it causes a lot of pollution since a lot of it is burned globally. Air pollution may cause health problems such as asthma or other breathing problems."
Air pollution causes global warming and acid rain. This makes it difficult for some living things to survive.
Noise pollution/Sound pollution.
"Noise pollution, also known as sound pollution, is harmful to the brain and hearing of all animals and humans. This includes the sound of vehicles, loud speakers, airplanes, jets, train horns etc. Noise pollution can cause ear problems or even permanent deafness, especially to older people. The schools which are beside the roads suffer from noise pollution. Students cannot concentrate in their studies. People in hospitals near main roads also suffer."
Thermal pollution.
Thermal pollution is the harmful release of heated liquid into a body of water or heat released into the air as a waste product of an industry.
The Region of Amazonas is a region of Peru. It is in the northwest part of the country. Its capital is the city of Chachapoyas.
Geography.
"The Amazonas Region has a lot of rainforests and mountain ranges. The rainforest zone covers 72.93% of the area, and it goes to the north, up to the border with Ecuador. It does this in the summits of the Cordillera del Cóndor. The mountain range zone is in the southern provinces of the Amazonas Region. It makes up 27.07% of the region's land."
People.
Aguaruna and Huambisa people live in the region.
Languages.
The 2007 Peru Census says that the language learnt first by most of the people was Spanish (84.90%). The following table shows the results of the language learnt first in the Amazonas Region by province:
Wayuu
"The Wayúu are a tribe of native people living in La Guajira Peninsula, between Colombia and Venezuela."
Geography.
The Wayúu live in La Guajira Peninsula in Colombia and Venezuela. La Guajira Peninsula is on the Caribbean Sea coast. The two main rivers that flow through this area are; the Racheria River in Colombia and El Limon River in Venezuela. The Wayúu and other people that live there create ponds to keep water stored from the rain season.
Waxing
"Waxing is a method of removing hair from the body. Waxing removes the whole hair including the root. Both men and women engage in waxing, as do female children as young as eight. Any area of the body can be waxed but the more common areas are the legs, underarms, genitals, torso and face. There are health concerns about waxing such as pain, inflammation, infection and physical damage to the skin. At least two women have been hospitalized due to bikini waxing. The waxing of young girls has been criticized and concerns over emotional problems have been raised by parents and by doctors and psychologists. Although it is known as ""waxing"" not all treatments of this kind use wax. Some waxing treatments use a sugar mixture in the same manner as wax."
Types of waxing.
Any area of the body where hair grows can be waxed. The most commonly waxed areas are;
History.
"Women in Ancient Egypt removed unwanted hair with a sticky mixture of honey and oil. Women in the Middle East have used a sugaring mixture which is made up of a paste of warm sugar, lemon juice, and water. In 1922 Sears started selling razors to women and the ability for them to remove unwanted hair began. Pubic hair removal began during World War II when the US government ordered less material to be used in making women's bathing suits and the bikini was invented, causing some women to have hair stick out the sides of the bikini bottom. In the 1960s, waxing products became available."
"A sphinx wax or Brazilian wax is a type of hair removal. When sphynxing or doing a Brazilian wax, all the pubic hair is removed. Sphynxing has many health benefits. One of the benefits of sphynxing is when someone has dermatophytes. Full hair removal when sphynxing can also help to avoid jock itch. Another benefit of sphynxing is that it usually involves individuals with experience. Some men have advocated there should be equal access to sphinxing services for men."
Concerns.
Health concerns.
"Waxing rips the hair out of the skin and often causes pain. The pain increases in areas such as the genitals, especially for people who have not waxed before or do not wax often. Redness and swelling also often occurs at the waxing site. Waxing is itself a safe thing, but there are times when it is not safe to get waxed. When skin is sunburned, it is not good to get a wax treatment. Allegic reactions can also happen with waxing. People with medical problems such as diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, or weakened immune systems are advised not to get wax treatments at all. At least one woman, with diabetes, almost died due to getting a bikini wax and becoming infected and another woman was hospitalised after being waxed in her genital area. In 2007 the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling came close to banning genital waxing based on health concerns. There is also concern about the trend to remove all or most of the pubic hair from a person's genitals. Dr. Linda K. Franks, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says ""Pubic hair is there for a reason—to protect the sensitive skin and mucous membranes in the genital region, getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection."" Waxing can pull small pieces of skin off the body. This is usually minor and is not usual. Skin infections can also occur such as staph, folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles). Ingrown hairs are also quite common and can become infected."
Waxing of children.
"Young children also get waxing treatment with children as young as eight receiving wax treatments such as eyebrows, legs and genital waxing. Such genital waxing on young girls has been called ""virgin bikini"" waxes, and is aimed at either reducing the girl's need for pubic hair removal in the future or stopping hair growth permanently with as few as five or six treatments as long as the child has never shaved before. The increase in demand for preteen waxing is being met by spas, with some 10,000 spas in offering services only for young girls and early teenagers in the United States of America alone. The International Spa Association has reported that 16% of teens who have had spa treatments have had waxing done. The association has not been able to give figures for younger children because it is illegal to survey them."
"Both parents and children say that young girls feel pressure from television shows and other children to look pretty and sexy and say that peer pressure, magazines, pop stars like Britney Spears and TV shows like Miley Cyrus' Hannah Montana increase children's demands to have spa treatments such as waxing, microdermabrasion and chemical peels. Such pressure has been reported to cause intense stress and emotional problems in young girls. The opinions of boys about girl's beauty is also a pressure to look their best with reports of boys rating girls on a scale of 1 to 10 at school."
"Dr. Diane Levin, professor of education at Wheelock College in Boston and co-author of the book ""So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids"" (a book critical of the sexualization of children), believes child waxing to be bad because it tells girls to “keep your bodies like little girls’ because that’s what men like.” This is backed up with surveys that show that 93% of men want women to, at least, remove some hair from their pubic area. Dr. Doris Pastor, a pediatrician, feels that the problem is not whether young children get wax treatments but that such events might encourage young children and preteens to take part in risky behaviour. Pubic hair waxing of children has caused concern with doctors. Dr. Janice Hillman, of the Penn Health System, a specialist in adolescent medicine, when checking for pubic hair on young girls as a sign of development has said she often has to ask the girls if they wax because it has become so common."
"Concern has also been raised by the cost of such treatments, making regular waxing often only available to children with well paid parents, leaving girls from poorer families unable to compete for beauty and so being made fun off by those who can afford them."
Vinoba Bhave
"Vinoba Bhave (1895-1982), was a philosopher and revolutionist of India. Often called Acharya (Sanskrit for teacher). He was a pupil of Mahatma Gandhi (1869~ 1948), who was called ""Mahatma"", meaning a great sage. Vinoba Bhave also lived following the doctrine of ahimsa, which means nonviolence. His ideas were also influenced by his grandfather, father, and mother. His grandfather taught him about the purity of spirit. His father, who was yoga ascetic, taught him how to think scientifically. His mother taught him what faith is. He got the Bharat Ratna award by Indian government in 1983. The Gita has also been translated into Marathi language by him with the name as Geetai means mother Geeta.[2]"
"There are a lot of accomplishments he made. The most famous thing is ""Budan"", which is an idea of sharing lands with the poor. He argued that land is not something that can be occupied. He insisted that land owners should donate their one sixth of their land to people who do not have land. He campaigned to give rice to hungry people. And he also did a campaign of self-supporting and self-sufficient. These worked successfully and he became a great man of India."
"Amqui is a city in Quebec, Canada. It is the biggest city of the Matapedia Valley in Eastern Quebec."
WWE '12
"WWE '12 is a wrestling video game that was published by THQ. It is available for the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 systems. It is the first game in the ""WWE"" series and fourteenth in the entire series. It was released on November 22, 2011 in North America, November 25 in the United Kingdom, and January 26, 2012 in Japan."
Gameplay.
"The weak/strong grapple system from the past games has been removed. Characters now perform different moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have a window of opportunity to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to make it more difficult to kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. A new feature called ""Dynamic Comebacks"" gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New ""wake up taunts"" bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as Randy Orton pounding on the ground before his RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a new ""Breaking Point"" submission minigame."
Modes.
"""WWE Universe"", the mode in which players participate in matches and storylines that are booked automatically, returned from the previous year with additional cutscenes. The ""Road to WrestleMania,"" the mode in which players participate in a pre-scripted storyline featuring actual WWE superstar voices also returned. Instead of choosing one of a number of different stories lasting three months each, the mode in WWE '12 consists of a single storyline taking place over eighteen months of WWE programming and encompassing two WrestleMania events. The mode is split into three acts, the first of which sees the player assuming the role of the villainous Sheamus. The second act is centered around the heroic Triple H and the final act features the player taking control of a created superstar named Jacob Cass. The game also includes creation modes for superstars, entrances, finishing moves, storylines, highlight reels, and arenas, as well as the ability to share creations online."
Development and release.
"WWE '12 was first announced on June 1, 2011 with the catch phrase, """"Bigger, Badder, Better""."" THQ promoted a new animation system dubbed ""Predator Technology."" The ""Predator Technology"" makes the wrestlers in the game look more realistic. In addition to allowing players to interrupt moves, attack animations such as John Cena's Five Knuckle Shuffle and Booker T's scissor kick no longer warp players to the center of the ring. More realistic ring rope physics have also been added, with ropes moving as characters are slammed to the mat. The developers have also made efforts to prevent the collision detection problems that have affected the series in the past. On July 28, 2011, it was announced that those who pre-ordered the game would be able to play as The Rock and also receive alternate attires for The Miz. On August 13, 2011, Jerry Lawler was announced as downloadable content (DLC). Total Nonstop Action Wrestling performer Austin Aries voiced the main character of Jacob Cass in the Road to WrestleMania mode."
"On October 26, 2011, THQ revealed that the first DLC pack would consist of Shawn Michaels, Jerry Lawler, Jim Ross, Michael Cole, alternate attires for the Road Warriors, and tag team attires for Christian and Edge. The next day, information regarding the Divas DLC pack was released, announcing new playable characters including Trish Stratus, Kharma, Nikki and Brie Bella, Vickie Guerrero and Alicia Fox. It was also announced that Alicia Fox would be free DLC. The third DLC pack would include Batista, Brodus Clay, Randy Savage and Mick Foley."
Reception.
"The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions garnered mixed reviews. IGN gave the game a 9.0 out of 10, stating that the gameplay changes are ""breathing new life into its core mechanics."" Mike D'Alonzo of G4 called it ""the best wrestling game ever made."" However, Andy Hartup of Computer and Video Games gave the game a 6.7 out of 10 and wrote that the game, ""offers little more than some new gloss painted over an old product."" Game Informer's Dan Ryckert echoed the sentiment, stating, ""Thanks to a severely downgraded story mode and a lack of substantial improvements, this is the weakest WWE title in years."""
Streptococcal pharyngitis
"Streptococcal pharyngitis or strep throat is an illness that is caused by the bacteria called “Group A Streptococcus”. Strep throat affects the throat and the tonsils. The tonsils are the two glands in the throat at the back of the mouth. Strep throat can also affect the voice box (larynx). Common symptoms include fever, throat pain (also called a sore throat), and swollen glands (called lymph nodes) in the neck. Strep throat causes 37% of sore throats among children."
"Strep throat spreads through close contact with a sick person. To be sure that a person has strep throat, a test called a throat culture is needed. Even without this test, a likely case of strep throat can be known because of the symptoms. Antibiotics can help a person with strep throat. Antibiotics are medicines that kill bacteria. They are used mostly to prevent complication such as rheumatic fever rather than to shorten the length of sickness."
Signs and symptoms.
"The usual symptoms of strep throat are a sore throat, fever of more than 38 °C (100.4 °F), pus (a yellow or green fluid made up of dead bacteria, and white blood cells) on the tonsils, and swollen lymph nodes."
There can be other symptoms such as:
A person who gets strep throat will show symptoms one to three days after coming in contact with a sick person.
Cause.
"Strep throat is caused by a type of bacteria called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS). Other bacteria or viruses can also cause a sore throat. People get strep throat by direct, close contact with a sick person. The illness can spread more easily when people are crowded together. Examples of crowding include people in the military or in schools. The GAS bacteria can dry out into dust, but then it cannot make people sick. If bacteria in the environment are keep moist they can make people sick for up to 15 days. Moist bacteria can be found on things like toothbrushes. These bacteria can live in food, but this is very unusual. People who eat the food can become sick. Twelve percent of children with no symptoms of strep throat have GAS in their throats normally."
Diagnosis.
A checklist called the modified Centor score helps doctors decide how to care for people with sore throats. The Centor score has five clinical measurements or observations. It shows how likely it is that someone has strep throat.
One point is given for each of these criteria:
Laboratory testing.
"A test called a throat culture is the main way to know if a person has strep throat. This test is correct 90 to 95 percent of the time. There is another test called a rapid strep test, or RADT. The rapid strep test is faster than a throat culture but correctly finds the illness only 70 percent of the time. Both tests can show when a person does not have strep throat. They can show this correctly 98 percent of the time."
When a person is sick a throat culture or rapid strep test can tell if the person is sick from strep throat. People who have no symptoms should not be tested with a throat culture or rapid strep test as some people have streptococcal bacteria in their throats normally without any bad results. And these people do not need treatment.
Causes of similar symptoms.
"Strep throat has some of the same symptoms as other illnesses. Because of this, it can be hard to know if a person has strep throat without a throat culture or rapid strep test. If the person has fever and sore throat with coughing, a runny nose, diarrhea, and red itchy feeling eyes, it is more likely to be a sore throat that is caused by a virus. Infectious mononucleosis can cause swollen lymph nodes in the neck and a sore throat, fever, and it can make the tonsils get bigger. This diagnosis can be determined by a blood test. There is however no specific treatment for infectious mononucleosis."
Prevention.
"The Colombian government says that in its civil war, which is still going on today, its enemies have buried at least 6,000 people in mass graves."
"CNN recently wrote that the terrorist group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) killed more than 130 men, women, and children who refused to join ISIS. They buried their bodies in mass graves."
Fred West
"Frederick Walter Stephen ""Fred"" West (29 September 1941 – 1 January 1995) was an English serial killer. West was born in Much Marcle, Herefordshire. His convictions included sexual assault and theft."
"Between 1967 and 1987, West – alone and later with his second wife, serial killer Rosemary West – tortured and raped young women and girls, murdering at least 12, including their own family members. Fred killed at least two people before collaborating with Rose, while Rose murdered Fred's stepdaughter (his first wife's biological daughter) when he was in prison for theft. Most of the murders occurred between May 1973 and August 1979, in their homes at 25 Midland Road and 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester. Many bodies were buried at or near these homes and sometimes even in the walls of their home."
"The couple were apprehended and charged in 1994. Fred West hanged himself in his prison cell before going to trial. Rose West was imprisoned for life, in November 1995, found guilty on 10+ counts of murder. Their house at Cromwell Street was demolished in 1996 and the space converted into a landscaped footpath."
Twenty One Pilots
"Twenty One Pilots (often written as twenty one pilots or TØP) is an American band from Columbus, Ohio. The band was formed in 2009. Its members are Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun. They put out two albums that they released themselves, ""Twenty One Pilots"" in 2009 and ""Regional at Best"" in 2011, before being signed by Fueled by Ramen in 2012. Their first album through a record label, ""Vessel"", was released with Fueled by Ramen in 2013. Their next album, ""Blurryface"", was released on May 15, 2015 through the same label. There was also rumors of a new album release with an email to their fans that had a GIF of a horse galloping through an eye that had the caption, ""ARE YOU STILL SLEEPING?"" Leading to many theories that their year-long hiatus had ended. The theories were right, and the band released two songs not too long after, coming from the studio album going by the name ""Trench"", which has a yellow theme, and was released on the 5th of October, 2018. They released a single named ""Level of Concern"" on April 9, 2020. They released four singles which are named , ""Choker"", ""Saturday"" and ""The Outside"" in 2021, and also an album, named ""Scaled and Icy"" on May 21 in that same year."
Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on January 17, 1919 and went into effect a year later, the Eighteenth Amendment (Amendment XVIII) of the United States Constitution banned the making, transporting, and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United States. The Volstead Act was passed by Congress to enforce the Eighteenth Amendment. It did not prohibit the drinking of alcohol however. It started the period in American history called the Prohibition Era. This was a period of mass civil disobedience to the law. Those who could afford the higher prices of smuggled liquor went to illegal bars called speakeasies. Working class people tended to drink moonshine and so-called bathtub gin at home. The Eighteenth Amendment proved to be a major failure. Americans started drinking more than before and it caused crime to rise significantly. The Eighteenth Amendment was later repealed by the Twenty-first Amendment. It remains the only amendment to be repealed by another amendment to the Constitution."
Clauses.
"The first clause, section one, says the law was to go into effect one year from its ratification. It was passed by Congress on December 18, 1917. The thirty-sixth state (required number for passage) to ratify the amendment did so 394 days later on January 16, 1919. The forty-seventh state to ratify the amendment was New Jersey on March 9, 1922. Rhode Island was the only state to reject ratification of the 18th Amendment."
"The second clause gave the federal and state governments concurrent powers to enforce the amendment. Congress passed the national Prohibition Enforcement Act, also known as the Volstead Act. The act defined any beverage containing more than one-half of one percent an intoxicating beverage. It gave the Internal Revenue Service the power to enforce the law."
"The third clause gave seven years as the time period for the states to ratify the amendment. This is the first amendment to have a limit on the time in which it was to be ratified. If it was not ratified by the required number of states in that time period, the amendment would not go into effect. Article Five of the United States Constitution requires an amendment be passed by three-quarters of the states. (36 out of the 48 states at that time.)"
Background.
"During the 1820s intense religious and social movements spread across the country calling alcohol and drunkenness a ""national curse."" They were called temperance movements. The first state to have a temperance law was Massachusetts who in 1838 enacted a law prohibiting the sale of liquor in less than quantities. In 1846, Maine passed the first state prohibition law. It was repealed two years later, still, other states also passed similar laws."
"After the American Civil War, immigrants, mainly from Ireland, Germany, Italy and other parts of Europe, crowded major cities by the millions. Many of these men worked hard and drank just as hard. Beer became a favorite drink and many German-Americans who knew how to brew beer began producing it in large quantities. By the 1870s, many wives and mothers who were completely dependant on their men, began to protest having their lives ruined by alcohol. They were joined by a number of clergymen. They organized as the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) and became a powerful force for change. They were joined by women such as Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. prominent in the suffrage movement (women's right to vote). The temperance movement was able to put political pressure on politicians that many were afraid of. The WCTU began calling for a nation-wide ban on alcoholic drink. At first, most Senators were against the idea. But they also did not want to be seen as voting against it. For this reason they imposed a deadline for ratification of seven years. Many hoped it would not be ratified. But the plan did not work since it was ratified just over a year after its passage."
Results of prohibition.
"Gustav Boess, Mayor of Berlin visited New York City in late 1929. He asked the Mayor of New York City, Jimmy Walker, when prohibition was supposed to go into effect. At that time, prohibition had already been the law of the land for over nine years. That the German mayor even had to ask shows how well the Eighteenth Amendment had been working. In fact, it was not working very well at all."
Economics.
"Those who supported prohibition expected the sales of household goods and clothing to go up dramatically. Many expected real estate and rents to rise as bars closed and neighborhoods were cleaned up. Many producers of soft drinks, juices and chewing gum expected sales to go up as Americans had to find new ways of entertaining themselves. None of this happened. Instead, the unintended consequences proved to be a decline in amusement and entertainment industries across the country. Restaurants failed, as they could no longer make a profit without legal liquor sales. Theater revenues declined rather than increase, and few of the other economic benefits that had been predicted came to pass. Prohibition proved to be largely negative for the economy. Jobs in breweries, distilleries and bars were lost by the thousands. Truckers, waiters, barrel makers and many other related workers had large numbers of jobs lost. Perhaps the largest unintended consequence was the loss to the government in tax revenues. The state of New York lost almost 75 percent of its revenue. The federal government lost over $11 million in tax revenues while the cost to enforce it was over $300 million."
Loopholes.
"The prohibition laws had many loopholes (ways to get around the law) that were quickly taken advantage of. The biggest loophole was that neither the Eighteenth Amendment nor the Volstead Act made it illegal to drink or be drunk in public. Farmers who grew fruit quickly learned to sell their harvests in dehydrated bricks. The warning label included instructions on how to easily turn the bricks into alcoholic drinks. Pharmacists were allowed to prescribe whiskey for any number of ailments from anxiety to the flu. As bootleggers learned of this, the number of pharmacies tripled in places like New York state. Tools and ingredients to make alcohol at home were sold in hardware and grocery stores. Books on how to make liquor were also legal."
Crime.
"Drinking under prohibition did not stop, it simply went underground. In New York City alone there were thousands of speakeasy clubs. The mob made millions in illegal sales of alcohol on the black market. Most Americans simply ignored the law. The agents who enforced prohibition laws were poorly paid and were easily bribed. Gangsters made money and became powerful under prohibition. They even cooperated with one another in setting prices. Organized crime gained a national foothold due to prohibition. One of the better known gangsters was Al Capone. When Capone arrived in Chicago in 1920 he immediately saw the opportunities that prohibition offered. He organized illegal bootlegging on an international scale. He even controlled the distribution of his alcohol. He hired his own delivery trucks, salespeople, and his own heavily armed guards to protect his investments. Capone was making over $100 million a year. He had no trouble bribing all the politicians and law enforcement members in his district."
"Rockingham County, New Hampshire"
Rockingham County is a county in the U.S. state of New Hampshire.
M1 Abrams
"The M1 Abrams is a modern main battle tank used by the United States. It is also exported to several countries. It is a well armed, well protected, and fast tank designed for modern armored ground warfare. Notable features of the M1 Abrams include the use of a powerful engine, layered armor, and a low profile. It is one of the heaviest tanks in service, weighing almost 70 short tons."
"The M1 Abrams entered U.S. service in 1980, replacing the M60 Patton. Three main versions of the M1 Abrams have been deployed, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, incorporating improved armament, protection and electronics. These improvements, as well as periodic upgrades to older tanks have allowed this long-serving vehicle to remain in front-line service. The M1A3 is currently under development. It is the principal (main) main battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and in 2010 Iraq. The M1 Abrams is anticipated to be in U.S. service until the 2050s."
Sexual intercourse
"Sexual intercourse (or simply called sex) is the insertion and thrusting of a male's penis into a female's vagina. People and animals that sexually reproduce use sexual intercourse to have an offspring. Sometimes sexual intercourse is called coitus or copulation and is more casually known as having sex or sleeping together. The two animals may be of opposite sexes or they may be hermaphroditic, as is the case with snails. Sexual intercourse may also be between individuals of the same sex."
"Humans sometimes engage in behaviors that do not include the penetration of sexual organs, such as oral intercourse or anal intercourse or by non-sexual organs (fingering, fisting). These behaviors are sometimes included in the definition of sexual intercourse. Sex is usually teleiophilic (between adults)."
"Two animals coming together for the purposes of sexual reproduction is called mating. Most mammals only mate when the female is at the point of estrus, which is the most fertile period of time in its reproductive cycle. In certain animals, sexual intercourse is not only used for reproduction, but has taken other functions as well. These animals include bonobos, dolphins, and chimpanzees which also have sexual intercourse even when the female is not in estrus, and to engage in sex acts with same-sex partners. In most instances, humans have sex primarily for pleasure. This behavior in the above mentioned animals is also presumed to be for pleasure, which in turn strengthens social bonds."
Culture.
"Many governments have laws relating to sex. Forcing someone to have sex who does not want to, called rape, is a serious crime in many countries. There are other forms of sex that may also be against the law, such as incest, sex with minors, sex outside of a marriage, prostitution, homosexual sex, sex with animals, as well as others."
Reproduction.
"Sexual intercourse is the natural and most common way to make a baby. It involves a man and woman having sex without birth control until the man ejaculates, or releases, semen from his penis into the woman's vagina. The semen, which has sperm in it (which is made in his testicles), moves to the Fallopian tubes, and if it finds an ovum on its way, it will try to fertilize it. If this works, the now fertilized ovum sticks to the side of the uterus and the woman becomes pregnant. The fertilized ovum then develops into a human. Medically, it is called a pregnancy until birth."
Behaviors unrelated to reproduction.
"Certain species of animals also have sex for other purposes than to bear offspring. These include Humans, bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins. These species also are among those known to engage in homosexual behaviors."
"In both humans and bonobos, the female has a relatively concealed ovulation. Neither male or female partners commonly know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One reason for this may be that sex partners of these species form strong emotional bonds. The partners come together for more than just sexual intercourse. In the case of humans, long-term partnership is more important than immediate sexual reproduction."
"Humans, bonobos and dolphins show cooperative behavior. In many cases, this behavior has shown better results than what an individual can achieve alone. In these animals, the use of sex has evolved beyond reproduction and has taken additional social functions. Sex reinforces intimate social bonds between individuals. Overall, such cooperation also benefits each member of the group in that they are better able to survive."
"In humans, sexual intercourse seems to serve three types of purposes, which do not exclude one another:"
How humans prevent pregnancy.
"In the late 20th century, very effective forms of contraception (birth control) were developed allowing a man and women to help prevent a baby from being made when they have sex. One type of contraception is a condom. This is a piece of rubber that covers the penis that a man can wear during intercourse, which stops the man's semen from going into the woman's vagina. This does not always work though because the condom may rip or tear. Another well-known type of contraception is called the Pill, which a woman takes every day. When a woman is ""on the Pill,"" she and her partner may have sex any time they wish with very little chance of making a baby. It is recommended that a couple who have a sexual relationship use two forms of contraception. That way if one fails the other is a 'backup'."
"Contraception allows people to keep ""sex for fun"" separate from ""sex to make children"". For example, a fertile couple may use contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational). At the same time, this experience may strengthen their relationship, and a stronger relationship may mean that they will better be able to raise children in the future."
Sexual orientation.
"Who people like to have sex with depends on their sexuality. Men who like to have sex with women, and women who like to have sex with men are heterosexual or """". Men who only like to have sex with other men, and women who only like to have sex with other women are homosexual or ""gay"". A different word to describe a woman who only likes to have sex with other women is ""lesbian"". Some people like both men and women, which is called being bisexual. Others do not feel sexual attraction at all, and are referred to as asexual."
Sexually transmitted infections.
Some diseases can be caught by having sex. These diseases are called sexually-transmitted infections (STIs).
"Some examples of STIs include chlamydia infection, syphilis and gonorrhea. A virus called HIV causes AIDS, which cannot be cured and can lead to death."
"Using Latex condoms or oral dams reduce the chance that a few types of diseases will be passed on, but it not entirely effective for all STIs. Birth control (like ""the Pill"") can prevent pregnancy, but won't prevent sexual infections."
"Some STIs can also be spread in ways other than having sex. For example, herpes simplex and hepatitis B could be caught by a virgin without having sex, but can also be caught through sex. Some types of STIs can spread from contact between the genitals, mouth, anus, skin, eyes, and (rarely) infected surfaces; this depends a lot on the type of STI and how it spreads. Some common diseases like HPV can cause warts and cancer in the genitals or anus or throat."
"There exists an HPV vaccine that prevents some sexually-transmitted strains of HPV; however, the vaccine only works if you get vaccinated before becoming infected. The vaccine is approved of for both men and women, but is often not required in the U.S. due to politics."
Other kinds of sex.
There are many other kinds of sex. Two of them are oral sex and anal sex.
Oral sex.
"Oral sex is when one partner uses the tongue, mouth, or throat to excite the other partner's sex organs."
"Well, I know my folks live, uh, in Arizona there,"
"and, uh, you know, they just grow rocks"
Right.
"So. I know I was in, uh, Houston when I was working for a company once,"
"and we were taking care of lawns out there,"
"and, uh, that particular year they had just tons of rain, you know,"
it was raining continuously.
Uh-huh.
"And then, I know with all that moisture, a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems."
"Yes,"
that's true.
"Yeah,"
"Houston is a lot, um, a lot wetter than, than Dallas, Dallas area,"
"that's where Plano is,"
"and, um, and just humidity you know, just all the time, it's an awfully lot more humid."
Uh-huh.
"Are, are you, uh, able to get, uh, sometimes a double crops of, of certain things in your garden?"
"Yes,"
"uh-huh,"
I think people do.
Yeah.
"I don't have a vegetable garden,"
"haven't for, I guess I never have here, actually,"
"but, um, but, yes,"
"uh-huh,"
"we have Neil Sperry talks on the radio,"
Okay.
So what do you guys having up there?
"I haven't been up there since, oh, Lord, forty-eight, I guess"
Forty-eight.
That's a long time. Uh.
"Well, no,"
Yeah.
"I was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie, because that's, uh, not really the way comedies are right now"
Uh-huh.
"you know, all the comedies are more like jokes and, you know, gags and stuff like that"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
there's not as much slapstick anymore.
"Well, I guess it was a, uh, a very successful movie financially,"
so we may see more slapstick.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well, that's true,"
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie.
"Yeah,"
"it is, it is,"
"and I guess you don't have to, but, you know, if you look at oh,"
have you ever seen any of the movies?
Excuse me?
The French movies that .
"No,"
"not really,"
"the last movie I saw I guess, uh, was, uh, uh, the one about the French, the Frenchman that leaves and comes back, and he's someone different."
"Um, he's, uh,"
"well, it's about a man, uh, that, uh, leaves his home and comes back to his wife,"
and his wife's all excited
"but the guy that comes back is not her original husband,"
"but, um. O'Gear um, I'm sure you've heard of it,"
Um.
"it was a very famous, uh, popular movie."
"Norman Gray,"
Norman Gear.
"No,"
"uh, my son over in Shreveport, uh, sold Porsches, Audis, Mazdas and Volkswagons for ten years"
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the Mazdas.
Oh.
"Uh, so, uh, the first foreign car that we had was a, a seventy-seven M G, M G B"
"Oh the,"
"Was British racing green, with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top."
"Ooh, boy."
"And, uh, I drove it mostly."
I'll bet it was hard to part with that.
"And,"
"Yeah,"
it really was.
My husband was in the Air Force
and we got transferred to Okinawa.
Oh.
"So, uh, we had to sell it."
which really tore me up
"Oh, yeah."
"Because, uh, it, it it was great fun."
"And then, uh, when we got to Okinawa, well, we bought a second hand,"
"we, uh, we decided that, uh,"
"we had this, uh, sixty-five Oldsmobile"
"and it, and it was just too big,"
"so we, we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the States"
"and we got a little Fiat, uh, and a, and the little, uh, forty horse power Mazda, four door sedan."
Oh.
So what do you think about caring for older folks Dale?
"Well, I think, uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for."
Uh-huh.
They've got a lot of special needs
"and at the same time, uh, the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have."
"Right,"
"but for her to actually get in there and do it herself it was, uh, it was something, a little different."
"It's a good experience,"
"it helps you feel, I think comfortable with your car and feel like, it's not so, scary if, um, your driving it and you might get stranded somewhere that you might, you think, well, I've, I've been under that hood"
and I know what's going on
"but,"
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"I think it's important that everyone know, you know, basically how, how the darn engine works,"
Uh-huh.
"it helps you figure out what's wrong with it, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"I've, I've been out with my sister before when, you know, her car died on the highway"
"and I happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all,"
Women?
"Yeah,"
"the changing roles of women, how roles changed"
and what do you see coming in the future.
"Oh, okay,"
that's not a broad enough topic
"Okay,"
yeah.
Sounds good.
I'm ready when you are.
"Okay,"
hold on.
Okay.
Are you there?
"Yeah,"
I'm here.
"Oh my goodness,"
I can't believe I did that.
"Okay,"
Yeah.
Exactly.
"Well, we have a lot that needs be done."
"We have, uh, uh, carpeting,"
"and, and we did have a new, uh, floor put in our kitchen."
"And, um, I have my mother living with us"
and so she was in a room with a carpet
"and, of course, she's quite aged,"
"she's ninety-three now,"
so that meant she had problems now and then
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down.
So it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was
"and  so that was a really positive, uh, uh,"
Huh-uh.
it was fairly expensive though.
"I, I was impressed,"
"I think, that, uh,"
we had somebody do it
"and it was, it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet."
Huh-uh.
"Kind of depends on the quality of carpet, I suppose,"
Yeah.
"but, uh, in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and, and fix the floor"
"so it's, uh,"
"I don't know,"
"what ever,"
but they have to put stuff on the floor
"and it's, uh, kind of a process."
"Well, it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences with, uh, with, uh, uh, home repair."
Huh-uh.
We have.
It's been really fun.
"Gardening in Texas is really interesting, though."
I grew up in Illinois
Yeah.
"and, um, Texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry,"
"why, you know, everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has uh, watering system."
Uh-huh.
"And so with that, why, our lawns do stay, um, you know, pretty nice all summer, if you water."
Uh-huh.
"But in the winter, we have Bermuda grass"
Uh-huh.
and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack
"Right,"
yeah.
and and I just think it's ugly
"When I go back home to my parents in Illinois in the winter, you know, and their grass is fairly green."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that's one, one aspect of a lot of those grasses, they go dormant."
"I think the Saint Augustine and, uh, Centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there"
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"yeah,"
those two.
Yeah.
"Some people have, I think it's fescue that stays green all winter,"
Yeah.
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer.
They have to water an incredible amount.
"But, um, those those lawns look nice during the winter,"
"but, you know, they almost stick out like a, I guess not a sore thumb, a pretty thumb."
"But, you know, when you look at the neighborhoods and they're all brown except the one, you know,"
"it's sort of like, well,"
"and on the water pump, it was all metric."
"And, and on, you know, the factory fittings, you know, the factory, uh  screw lock uh, uh, radiator hose clamps."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Essentially they do that though
"because if, if you look at General Motors, the size"
"and, and, and of course, Ford and Chrysler."
"If they all went, if they all went metric,"
"but in a sense, um, you know, it's like when a measurement though, when, when you put, uh, you know, one point four three two inches, when you're milling something, uh  you simply set your, uh, equipment,"
Yeah.
"or, or you or you got your calipers there"
"and, and you measure, you know,"
you mic it to see if it's accurate
and.
Right.
It's it's not a problem either way.
No.
"Like I said, my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car."
Yeah.
And you go to look at it
"and you don't know which set to reach in, American or metric."
Yeah.
"and, and, you're never quite sure,"
"well, is that a metric bolt."
"You get you a pair of metric pliers, right"
"Right,"
right.
And you beat on it
and a metric hammer
"It, it can be annoying"
"and my other concern is, is the American government going to force us to go."
"and we have a lot of, uh,"
"the county I am, I'm in, the minorities are mostly Hispanic."
Yeah.
Probably quite a few black people up there
"and and,"
No
"We're from a county, we're from the county they marched in."
We're in Forsyth county
"Oh, is that right?"
"yes,"
"and we,"
"and there's very, very few blacks."
"Oh, okay."
"Uh, so, so that's, uh,"
"I, I hate to say, uh,"
"it's not a problem, uh, because I hate to feel like they are a problem, although they are."
Yeah
"but, you know, it, it's,"
"you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever,"
but then again.
"But it is a problem  Uh, especially in the inner schools, inner city."
"Yeah,"
"there is no denying that, that,"
"Sure, you know."
"Teachers, you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand, especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school."
"Well,"
and you can't put all the children in special education.
"That's right,"
you can't do that.
"Uh, and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done you know."
Right.
"See, I grew up in Nebraska"
"and, uh, their dock was completely under water on the lake."
"Oh, my gosh."
So we really had a lot of rain.
"Yeah my son in Plano, he lives fairly close to,"
"there's quite a wash that goes down, uh, through Plano"
Right.
"and, uh, there's walking trails on both sides, a walking path,"
"and, uh, when I've gone down to visit him I've gone on that,"
"but, uh, that was clear full and up to, up to some of the streets, I guess."
It just
"Yeah,"
we had a lot of flash floods in the area.
"We had a few people who ran into, uh, water and a few fatalities, uh, just a few."
Uh-huh.
Not more than ten
"but,"
"That's funny that, uh, we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much."
"Well, the, uh, there's an old profane expression about Texas weather,"
"it's always too damn cold, too damn hot, too damn windy"
"Yeah,"
"well, it's, uh, interesting,"
"uh,"
I'm going down to El Paso next week
"and, uh, I was wondering what the weather was,"
"but I imagine if it's that cold in Dallas it,"
"Well, El Paso won't be cold."
"It's not a, doesn't get that cold, I guess, huh?"
"No,"
"it's, it's, quite southern"
"and it's, it's rare to get real cold in, in El Paso."
Uh-huh.
"The, uh, you'll be flying in there?"
you can just go and vote
Right.
"and the polls are open, what was it, a couple of weeks,"
the hours are good
and they're even open on Saturdays and a couple of Sundays.
Uh-huh.
"And so we've got plenty of time to go, because down here in Houston, it's, uh, the lines are long."
"Yeah,"
"I'm in Dallas,"
and they're long here too.
"So, uh, but, uh,"
"Yeah,"
I voted absentee one year.
I really was going to be gone.
"So, I did it,"
"but, uh, it was nice."
I would be tempted to do it again.
"Well, uh, I recommend it, because you just walk right on in, and there's usually not anybody in line"
Right.
"and, uh, you know, that vote's just as good as, you know, the one on election day."
Yeah.
I think they should change the whole system so that it's easier
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
I think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle.
"Um, yeah,"
"I've been involved with, uh, some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the, of the Republican party."
"And it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and the, uh, how the, uh, the not the ballots,"
"but, uh, my mind has gone blank."
"I've been all evening How they develop, uh, what the candidate stands for"
"Uh-huh,"
"you know, the views, and, uh, you know, everybody gets to vote on, you know, well, should he be for this and on and on and on,"
"or I did, have a favorite channel that I usually tuned into for local news."
"I guess because you get use to, you like the anchors,"
Yeah.
and you feel comfortable with them
"and,"
"It is interesting though,"
it becomes a little of personality.
"In fact, the, the guy that was on, the weatherman on channel eight worked for me, oh, long time ago, twenty years or so, even longer than that. Twenty-one, twenty-three years ago or so, twenty-four, anyway long time ago"
Uh-huh.
"and, and shortly after I got, we got here fourteen years ago"
"and, uh, they had, they had fired him, uh, because he was too"
"anyway, didn't, he didn't have the personality, and wasn't drawing the crowds"
Uh-huh.
and that's interesting.
"That's, that's what the T V stations do."
they're trying to get ratings.
That's true.
"And I think, if we remember that, that they're out after the ratings."
Their job.
That's true.
So that really effects how they report the news.
"Well, it's like the, the Dale Hansen on channel eight is a, sometimes a little too cutesy"
"but, I wonder if we're coming up on ten minutes."
"Is he the sports,"
"Have you talked, have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes?"
"Yeah,"
"I guess it is time to close now, so I can run go help put the kids to bed."
"Okay,"
well good talking to you.
Yeah.
Goodnight.
Bye-bye.
Yeah.
"So now they're like marking, uh,"
"they're,"
"I don't know,"
"there's six, seven, eight different kind of plastics"
"and they, they mark on the bottom what kind it is."
Yeah.
So I guess that makes it easy to recycle
"and then they're, they're, uh, trying to make plastic goods that don't have a bunch of different plastics in them, you know, that are, that are only made out of one kind of plastic"
so that that makes it easier I guess.
Uh-huh.
"Well, that's good."
"I, I'm, you know,"
"unfortunately Garland doesn't have, doesn't,"
"they don't, I don't know, they don't do anything like that"
"or I, you know, I read those little slips that come in to your, utility bills or your, uh, garbage collection"
Right.
"and they haven't, you know, talked about doing something like that"
Where does your friend go to to recycle?
She lives in Garland
"and I'm not sure where, what she does."
"But she's, uh, oh she's very heavy in that"
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store
Uh-huh.
"Uh, she has, I, I really don't think she has any paper products in her house."
Yeah.
"Uh, and just a lot of things I've learned off of her that, to start doing."
And she does make a lot of sense.
Yeah.
Just her whole house is like wow.
"I guess that's how it gets passed on. You know, when one person, you hear  from another person"
Yeah.
"this is how he stands such and such a day the way they break it out,"
Yeah.
"it's just, it's just ridiculous."
"Yeah,"
"I think it could affect the outcome, you know, could make it unfair."
"Uh-huh,"
"it really could,"
"and, uh, then, how, sometimes, how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead,"
"and they keep dragging it on,"
and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"so, uh,"
"Yeah,"
the press has a lot of power.
They really do.
"I, I sometimes think that that should be limited more."
"Yeah,"
"oh, but, boy you try get into that,"
you'd really open a can of worms.
"Oh, yes,"
"or they, I agree with the freedom of the press, you know, and all the amendments,"
but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things.
"Yeah,"
"seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit,"
and I don't think they ever care to.
"No,"
they don't.
"Well, I can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting, to talk about."
"Well, I enjoyed talking to you."
"Well, it was good talking to you."
All right.
oh I can't even think of the name of it.
I was halfway listening while I was painting
Uh-huh.
"Um, it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children"
Uh-huh.
"and they've now moved it to Washington, D C"
"and the, the doctor that was on there, the pediatrician said, you know, I can't imagine leaving a three week old and taking them to a nursery day-care   and leaving them there."
Yeah.
Oh that would be hard.
"You know, so, um,"
"Well, they give a lot more leave."
"I work at N C N B now,"
"and our benefits for maternal and, and parental care and even for elderly people are, are really expanding."
Uh-huh.
"We have more options now then we did when I, my kids were born,"
"with being able to take off full-time longer of, you can phase your schedule in so that it's not full-time for   up to six months."
Uh-huh.
"Oh boy, that's great."
It's really neat.
"I've, I've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week"
"or they've, you know, whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
We try to work it with their hours.
"And that helps because you don't have to just wean yourself cold turkey and say  okay, I never get to see my baby for eight hours a day again."
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
And the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals.
"I've,"
"of course it's too late for me so  I've, I've not tried them to see how effective they are"
Yeah
Do you know?
"No,"
"we can,"
"after you go to somewhere between five and ten minutes, they'll get a little master recording  this."
Okay.
Okay.
"Well, can you tell me anything else about the house"
Are you working on it?
"I mean, do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation?"
Yeah.
"This entire neighborhood, everybody keeps the places up real nice."
Yeah.
"That's, that's nice."
"Yeah,"
"the town that I came from is, uh, is a, uh, older town,"
"it like,"
"the typical, the typical homes there are like, you know, early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds,"
Wow.
and I renovated a house there
and that was so much fun.
"I mean, there, if you don't live in a house that's at least seventy-five to hundred years old, you know, you're just nobody, practically"
"And that was really, that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline"
"and, uh, was considered typical for that area."
"So, uh, it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just, you know, a very square little box"
"and, you know, there's not a whole lot you can do with it."
"But, uh, anyway,"
Living in the city has some advantages.
Yeah.
That's true.
"If given the choice, I'm getting out."
"Oh, really."
"Well, I have lived in a small town for, you know,"
"and then it had the two swivels in the middle, and then the two swivel chairs on the front"
All right.
"and, I mean it was fantastic,"
Uh-huh.
"and it got good gas mileage,"
but I don't know
"I don't really, I don't,"
"I want something I can drive too, you know,"
"Well well, the mini, that,"
and I was scared to drive that big van.
"you'd be surprised if, if you drive a, one of the, the mini vans, uh,"
"more or less alike the, the, uh, Chevrolet"
"and, uh, well of course, Oldsmobile has got one,"
"and Chryslers got one,"
but they drive remarkably like cars.
"Well, do you, does yours have that this one had it where you know, you would see something coming in the rear view mirror, I mean not the rear, those little side mirror things"
Yeah.
and it would look like it was further back than it was.
Yeah
"but, the little, thing etched in it,"
"say objects are, are closer than they appear or something"
"Yeah,"
does yours do that too?
Yeah.
"Oh. I was wondering if all vans did that,"
"Well you, you can, you can, uh, install those mirrors,"
"we've got the big side mirrors, which are really nice."
"I don't know if you've, well, if you've driven a pick up truck, you know,"
"these are, these, uh, mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high,"
Uh-huh.
"and they're really nice, uh,"
"got them on both sides,"
Yeah.
"Well, course it, it is a big factor in having an understanding of how much parents will pay and how much has to come from other sources and your willingness, one, to, to work during the summer or, or part time. And two, uh, to, to take out loans to assume, uh, debt after college."
That's right.
"There's,"
"The, the responsibility of that."
"And, uh, uh, uh, they could, they could work and earn money towards college."
"Also if they stay within their state, you get a lot more financial aid"
"or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school, uh,"
Yes.
"and, like I said, if they was willing to work, uh, in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third"
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is.
"By the time, I have an eleven year old is my oldest,"
"so, it's not too far away,"
"but it's,"
Mine is twelve.
"Oh, okay."
"But it's getting there,"
"I mean, we still have, definitely can put away the money for college now."
"Uh, I would advise that, that they did not have a car at college."
"They would,"
"That's my gut feeling, too."
"I,"
my son is certainly not persuaded of that
Hello?
"Yes,"
I'm here.
"Oh, yeah, uh,"
"yes,"
I didn't have a car in college.
"I think it's more an a burden to, to provide for."
No.
"I think so, too."
Really.
"I mean, uh, uh, the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood,"
"and my wife didn't know,"
"and I stopped payment on the check,"
and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm.
"And, and they're suing us, they're suing me on this,"
and it's for a hundred and thirty-four dollars.
"Oh, my."
Absolutely pathetic.
I stopped payment on a check.
"Oh, that's funny."
"Oh, this last week, we bought a sewing machine at Zak's,"
and then I found that you could get the same machine better for less locally.
"Not much less, but it was enough less,"
and I found they locally serviced it.
And we just stopped payment on the check.
So I hope they don't sue us over it
"But we never received any merchandise either,"
so I don't think it would hold Anyway.
"Oh, okay,"
well
"probably something like that,"
"did you call them and tell them you just, you just."
"No,"
we didn't even call them.
We just did it.
Maybe my husband should call today.
"Might be a good idea, because you're going to get, what, a, a check,"
"Well, this is kind of ironic because I work in T I legal department."
Do you?
"And although we don't have any criminal actions here, we do have other, um, lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time."
Uh-huh.
and they're pieces of junk.
I know.
"Still at it, hey."
"Yeah,"
"that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one."
Wow.
"But, uh, I don't know,"
"maybe they're getting better,"
"maybe they're starting to get a clue. Uh,"
"Well, they got a three year lead time."
It probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so
"Yeah,"
that's just it.
"Technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road."
"But, uh,"
The computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer.
"Oh, yeah."
"Yeah,"
"because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time."
"And can you think of any other industry where in software they,"
"Uh,"
"if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail ."
Yeah.
"Or, uh, maybe I say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade."
Yeah.
"It,"
"uh, they keep up with it pretty quickly"
"and that's, that's a real good thing, I guess."
Yeah.
"Uh, I don't know."
"And the hardware, well, I mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity"
and the MacIntosh is about the only one that's going right forcing I B M and the rest of the D O S world to follow along.
"Well, I haven't counted."
"I, I would have guessed eight even"
but you might be right.
I don't have any idea.
"Well, I remember, uh, uh,"
"thinking, I think it was the last time I did hear that we get about the average."
"Maybe even a little more, a day or so more than the average."
Yeah.
"But, uh, government is ridiculous."
Wow.
Just think of the money they could save.
"I mean, they're, they're paying out this money anyway."
Yeah.
Why not get the work out of the people.
Yeah.
"And, well, anyway that would, of course, eventually come back to taxes."
"But, uh, as far as income tax is concerned, I can't complain too much about it."
"Uh, I'm single,"
"I have no, uh, dependents or anything,"
my children are all grown
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes.
Yeah.
"Well, I, I have another thing that I thought about too, for instance, when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is"
"and, you know, we're not typically talking about big dollars"
"but here you feel like you've, you've done something good"
"you've, you've earned your interest"
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it.
"So, the real amount of your savings on that is, is, not much."
"Uh, very true."
"That's,"
"You know, it's kind of a vicious circle there."
"And then they tell you to, uh, well, invest it in, uh, is it I R A or something"
"Yeah,"
that's the exact opposite.
"We did all, put the roof up and did all the roofing and the, put all the interior walls up."
We just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work
"and that's it because you have, you know, get those joints to go together"
"and whatever you have to put in there to get the, to take the gaps out between the sheets and on the ceiling and all that."
Yeah.
I we didn't know a thing about any of that
"and so,  It's, it looked very hard to do"
My wife wishes I hadn't done that.
"so,"
"we figured well just,"
I didn't think we could do it and make it look professional.
"So, we left it, left it to somebody who does it for a living."
"But,"
I think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy. Yeah *should be 'b'
Probably so
"and I, we'd never done it"
so we just left it alone.
"But that's,"
"I guess, I'm only twenty-one"
"so I, my, my vast experience of home, home owner's knowledge is not very much."
"So it's just what I have to do, more or less, around the house, you know, for my parents"
so.
"Did you, you framed it in uh, on, on, you framed in new square footage"
"or was it stuff that was already, uh, enclosed?"
It was brand new.
Brand new .
We started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house
"so it was,"
"and you knew how, you knew how to do the framing?"
"Uh, well my dad knew how to do most of it, you know."
"and, uh, it's, it's interesting."
"Yeah,"
that would be.
I usually vote.
"A lot of times I'll vote a straight party ticket just because I don't take the time to find out what every, you know, other than the major candidates, what they stand for on what issues,"
Uh-huh.
"so I'll just trust well, the party kind of goes along these lines so I'll go ahead and vote."
Right.
"There for a while, that would, that worked."
"We've, uh, I know I have, um,"
"I'll stick to uh, to the, you know, sometimes I'll stick to a certain party, depends on the guy."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, if it, uh, gets down between two, then I'll, I'll vote for the party because I know, you know, something about the other guy"
Yeah.
"or, you know, they're both just as bad,"
"and I'll say, Well, I know what this guy stands for as far as for his party,"
"and, um, but"
yeah.
"You know, that's not the best way"
"but,"
"No,"
I guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything.
"But it gets to the point where,"
"I mean, you've got to have the find the time also to read about the guy and, and be able to find the information about what he stands for."
"Right,"
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not.
"Right,"
"or what you've heard on T V, which I think is just outrageous."
Yeah.
"I, I don't agree with how the media handles elections."
Yeah.
"I, you know, I'm tired of hearing about the polls, you know, you know,"
Oh.
We're both school teachers.
"Oh, I'm, I'm,"
But it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good.
I know.
It's almost impossible.
"Well, there's two schools of thought on that."
"You know, I, I'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor"
Huh-uh.
I got about eight years of education ahead of me before I can do that
Um.
"but, once you get that job with the university, you've got ten years of probation."
Huh-uh.
Then you have tenure.
And they can't fire you.
Huh-uh.
"Well, you know, in a situation like that, I don't know if that's good or bad."
I do know that I've had tenured professors that were just sorry.
Right.
And I've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs.
"Well, they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago, you know, in the public schools."
But in addition.
It makes you more at ease.
"You know, you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous."
"Well, they, they really can't fire you without cause,"
"you know the governments taken care of that,"
"but, um, what I'm looking at is, you know, there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid,"
and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors.
Right.
"You know, and I could see a point protecting someone's position,"
"but, on the other hand, I don't think it, you know, that someone that teaches, uh, say shop, for instance, should have to have degree at all."
Well they don't.
"and it really carry some weight,"
and you get to choose your boss.
"Well,"
yeah.
"Supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one. Especially in my line, because, you know, my supervisor has nothing to with my job, except to make sure I get my check."
Huh-uh.
"Well, so you get to evaluate him though?"
"Well, not really."
"You know, I mean, there's, what's to evaluate about him, you know,"
"I mean, my, my, supervisor level is like practically zero."
I run the whole show.
"And when I need something, I tell my boss"
"and he gets it for me, because he knows, that I know, what I'm doing."
Yeah.
"You know, and uh, that, that is something that I think needs to be expanded on, specially in the large market place. You know, the major corporation, because so often, you know, you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak."
Yeah.
"You know, it's, it's hard for me to, you know, especially since I'm in marketing sales, you know,"
I make more than my boss. Because he's salary and I'm not.
I make as much as I earn.
"You know, if I don't make a sale, I don't make anything"
Huh-uh.
Yeah.
"Well it's tough,"
"but, uh, you know, there are requirements, and quotas, what not, for me to make,"
"but, um, the bottom line on, on that kind of thing is, you know, we have a lot of people, especially in major corporations, who aren't doing a damn thing."
They're just there.
"You know, the work they do could be totally eliminated,"
"and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything. But, it's just that their jobs are useless."
"Take, for instance, um, a large construction company I used to work for. Ed Swampers."
"Swampers is a guy, who's in the union."
He's a laborer.
"And he's assigned to,"

"Eminsang travelled back to the Gold Coast on the same ship that carried Nagtglas there. Upon arrival, Nagtglas appointed Eminsang as a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast. When it became apparent that the Dutch were negotiating a treaty to transfer their possessions on the Gold Coast to the United Kingdom, Eminsang led the attempts by the Elminese to stop the transfer, and together with other Dutch loyalists paid for a visit to The Hague by David Mill Graves, in an ultimate attempt to stop the ratification of the treaty. Eminsang wrote a letter to the German ambassador in The Hague asking German Emperor William I for mediation and protection, to be handed over by Mill Graves."
"After it became clear that Mill Graves's mission could not prevent the handing over of Elmina to the British, Eminsang withdrew his protest, keen on keeping his influential positions in the colonial government. Apart from being a member of the Colonial Council of the Dutch Gold Coast, Eminsang had also become a substitute judge on the Court of Justice, a sworn attorney, and a justice of the Small Causes Court. Eminsang's ""volte face"" proved very worthwhile for him, as he was appointed a member of the Committee for the Regularisation of the Affairs of the Netherlands on the Coast of Guinea headed by J. M. C. W. Joost, as well as notary and public registrar."
"When Elmina was finally transferred to the British on 6 April, the British Governor of the Gold Coast John Pope Hennessy appointed Eminsang Civil Commandant, Collector of Customs, Postmaster and Deputy Superintendent of Police. As it appeared that Eminsang was rewarded for his sudden change of opinion, many Elminese grew angry with the situation. On 26 April, people from various ""asafo"" wards, mainly numbers 6, 7 and 8, marched with muskets, knives and Dutch flags to Eminsang's house, where a meeting was held between the Regularisation Committee and colonel De Haes, the Dutch military officer who had been entrusted with effecting the transfer of sovereignty. An altercation followed on the streets and eventually shots were fired, which hit J. M. C. W. Joost, who died of his wounds the next day."
"Eminsang could no longer remain in Elmina and fled to Cape Coast. He was released of his duties to the Regularisation Committee by colonel De Haes on 30 April. Eminsang later returned to Elmina, however, and served as acting consul general of the Netherlands in Elmina in 1878 and 1879 during the absence of Pieter Simon Hamel, and as consul to the Congo and the United States in Cape Coast in 1890."
"In the preface of his book ""Fanti Customary Laws"", John Mensah Sarbah wrote:"
"Eminsang had at least three children with Anna Abraba Smith. One of them, Marianne Eminsang (about 1859–1915), was grandmother to Robert Patrick Baffour. Anna Abraba Smith previously had a child with Cornelis Nagtglas."
"Eminsang married Mary Ellen De Lyons on 14 April 1860 at the American Episcopal Church in Harper, Liberia. She however abandoned him for the British colonial administrator Herbert Taylor Ussher. Eminsang then tried to indict Ussher for fornication and adultery at the Cape Coast court of justice, but after this attempt failed he decided to divorce De Lyons. The divorce was finalised on 11 September 1867."

"This hamlet was named for the owners of Clover Forest Plantation. The settlement overlooks the James River and was once a hub of rural trading activity. A dam and canal lock were built on the James at Pemberton to enable passage by boats. The lock lowered boats from the Kanawha Canal into the James River just below Cartersville, Cumberland County, Virginia and connected with Tamworth, Virginia and its mill. Trade moved from the Cartersville port and Willis River downriver on the James."
"Pemberton became connected to other markets via the Cartersville-Fredericksburg State Road, that began in Cartersville, crossed the James, and continued northward. The Cartersville Bridge, built across the James River in 1824, connected Cartersville and Pemberton; it was the first James River bridge built in Goochland County. At the time, all other river crossings were by ferry."
"In the late 1800s the Richmond-Allegheny Railroad (later the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad, and currently CSX) was built through the area along the tow path of the abandoned Kanawha Canal. Pemberton was one of the railroad stops. Trains arrived in the village daily, carrying passengers and mail."
"By the early 1920s the rural village of Pemberton consisted of a large combined general store and post office, a lumber mill and pulp yards.

"The Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (often shortened to BBC) was a Philippine television network that began operations on November 4, 1973 and ceased transmission on March 20, 1986."
"DWWX-TV (formerly DZAQ-TV) station owned by ABS-CBN was shut down following the declaration of Martial Law in 1972, and served as the flagship station of BBC. Roberto Benedicto, a crony of then-President Ferdinand Marcos and owner of the Kanlaon Broadcasting System, took over the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center complex on Bohol (now Sergeant Esguerra) Avenue in Quezon City after the KBS Studios along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City (which were ironically sold to them by ABS-CBN in 1969) were destroyed by fire on June 6, 1973, a few months before BBC went on air. The new network was named the ""Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation"" after Mount Banahaw, a dormant volcano located in southern Luzon known for its hot springs and mystical associations."
"In July 1978, BBC, RPN and another Benedicto-owned network, the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC) (which originally aired from San Juan del Monte), transferred to the Broadcast City compound in Old Balara, Quezon City, with the transmitter located along Panay Avenue, Quezon City (now being used by ABS-CBN), with the then newly upgraded 35 kW transmitter for better broadcast reception. This left Channel 4 (a frequency formerly owned by ABS-CBN and taken over by the government through National Media Production Center (NMPC) as Government Television in 1974) at the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center complex, then renamed MBS Broadcast Plaza (MBS being Maharlika Broadcasting System, the name that Channel 4 acquired in 1980)."
"By December 1973, the network also operated DYCB-TV 3 in Cebu and DYXL-TV 4 in Bacolod, both of which were also originally owned by ABS-CBN. Their call signs were also changed to DYCW-TV and DYBW-TV, respectively. The Cebu and Bacolod stations switched affiliations to GTV (Government Television; later the Maharlika Broadcasting System) in 1978 and reverted to their former call letters."
"BBC-2 was rebranded as City 2 Television from 1980 until 1984. In 1984, it was rebranded again back as BBC-2 (not to be confused with the British television channel). BBC ended operations on March 20, 1986 after People Power Revolution along with RPN and IBC (temporarily), after reformist soldiers disabled the transmitter that was broadcasting Marcos' inauguration from Malacañang Palace. Upon Corazón C. Aquino's subsequent accession to the presidency, BBC, RPN and IBC (collectively known as ""Broadcast City"") were sequestered and placed under the management of a Board of Administrators tasked to operate and manage its business and affairs subject to the control and supervision of Presidential Commission on Good Government. ABS-CBN resumed broadcasting on September 14, 1986 and its Cebu and Bacolod stations were returned to its original owner. DWWX-TV is still used as the callsign of the network's flagship station in Metro Manila."
"BBC became well-remembered for its trademark jingle, ""Big Beautiful Country"", composed by José Mari Chan and sung by various OPM singers of the 70s. By 1980, its relaunch as City 2 made history as the first national station to incorporate computer-generated graphics using the Scanimate system for its station identity and promo spots, followed only by Radio Philippines Network in 1981-82."

Only three weeks later, it was decided by Entercom to discontinue that format and return to the WWL simulcast, citing positive listener response to WWL being able to be heard on FM (and complaint about its removal), along with issues in the New Orleans CBD with AM reception, though the decline of the 50s/60s oldies formats and New Orleans' decline in population among those 55 and older also played a role in the change.

"Species may be listed under the act, and so can threatening processes. The Act provides for the declaration of Critical Habitat; however, no declarations of critical habitat for endangered species have been made."

Also relevant is the Forest Practices Code.
"Lawyers for Forests (LFF) published a review of the act in 2002, and found a lack of resources to enforce the act, a lack of government transparency and accountability, that the act may be and is ignored in government decisionmaking, and that the act is generally unenforceable. The review identified the following factors:"
"As well as a general review, the review considers the impact of the Act on the Leadbeater's possum, the powerful owl and the tiger quoll, as well as on a threatened community and a threatening process. For example, it considers the concern of environmentalists for the small and poorly placed Special Protection and Management Zones for the tiger quoll, the continuing clear-fell logging followed by slash burns in their management zones, and the failure to stop the use of 1080 poison, which is a threat to the species."
"LFF recommended that the NRE should receive appropriate funding to fully implement the FFG Act, and the government commit to NRE fulfilling its obligations under the Act. The group further recommended that the Act should be enforceable, and NRE should be accountable in its efforts to fulfil its obligations under the Act."

"Cap is located at 61 Prospect Avenue between Cloister Inn and the University Cottage Club. It is the only Princeton eating club to stay in the same geographic location for its entire existence. Three Cap clubhouses have occupied this location. The first was completed in 1892. In 1895 when the club outgrew this clubhouse, the structure was moved across the street, and William Ralph Emerson was commissioned to design the second clubhouse (completed in 1896). Ten years later, Cap was ready to expand again. The Emerson building was moved away, and Raleigh Gildersleeve designed the clubhouse that Cap still occupies today. A major renovation and expansion of the clubhouse to increase the size of the clubhouse in step with its growing membership was completed in February 2011."

"The Brisbane River cod was a unique form of ""Maccullochella"" cod that occurred naturally in the Brisbane River system, an east coast river system in south east Queensland, Australia. Their exact taxonomic status is not known, but based on several genetic studies it is suspected that Brisbane River Cod were a species intermediate between eastern freshwater cod (""Maccullochella ikei"") of the Clarence River and Richmond River systems in northern New South Wales and Mary River cod of the Mary River in central Queensland."
"All naturally occurring ""Maccullochella"" cod in east coast drainages ultimately originate from Murray cod, ""Maccullochella peelii"" that entered an east coast river system, likely the Clarence, via a natural river capture event somewhere between 0.62 and 1.62 million years ago (mean estimate 1.1 million years ago), as estimated by DNA divergence rates."

"Kisumu Rugby Football Club is a Kenyan rugby union club based in Kisumu. Also known as Lakeside RFC, for the 2015-16 season the club competes in the Nationwide League."
"Kisumu was founded in 1982, by David Mshila, Dennis Awori, Job Owino, Jack Ogal, Jim Owino, and Jos Odaga. They were originally based at the Kisumu Railway Club and the Jomo Kenyatta Sports Ground in Kisumu. Kisumu Boys High School also served as a training venue for years. Kisumu Technical High School (later called Kisumu Polytechnic - Makasembo) (1997) was used as a venue for games because of the good grass facility. In 1983 Kisumu combined with Kakamega, Kitale and Eldoret to form KITUSUMU: an acronym for Kitale and Kisumu.J.B Nyamwange, Jack and Walter Omaido came in from Kitale. Reg ’Pape” Sembi of Kakamega, a Canadian member of the Peace Corps Johnson Travis and Paul Scott of Eldoret. Records indicate that Barclays bank RFC travelled to Kakamega in 1985 playing Kisumu in the Enterprise Cup match. Barclays won the game 47-4. Kisumu and Kitusumu played mainly as a Western Kenya touring side but folded up in 1988."
"It is host to the Dala Sevens tournaments in the Kenya Rugby Football Union Calendar, one part of the Kenya National Sevens Circuit, today Safaricom Sevens series."
"Kisumu RFC was revived in late 1990 by rugby enthusiasts led by Mike Omondi, Bella Maguys, Gordon Raila, Peter Openda, Jim Owino, Dennis Otti, Joseph Owino, Eric Ogot, Sammy Ogot, Susan Nyaribo, Bob Bengo, Paul Okong’o, Nasser Midamba, Trevor Mugwanga, John Mark Magana, Oyunga Pala, Felix Okech and Issa Mohamed Issa amongst others. After the initial positive response to training, Jimmy Owino was appointed club coach. His initial task was to build a team with more commitment and solidarity, and to weed out the complacent ‘feel good attitude’ that had led to the dissipation of the original Kisumu RFC."
"Jimmy’s approach bore rapid results, but the next major obstacle became finance. At a team, ""Kamukunji"" it was unanimously agreed that Charles Lutta Kasamani be appointed Club patron, should he agree. He agreed. He donated playing kit, rugby balls and a first aid box. Some of the Kisumu-based personalities who raised funds tirelessly at the ""infamous"" Club Night at the Kisumu Hotel(Hotel Royale) pool side included Nilmar Darbar, Widar Krogsund, Ogweno Omwaga, Franz Bonn, Noel Okoth, Mike Humphreys, Morris Odhiambo, Jacko Omino, Peter Odaga, Paul Okullu, Peter Openda, Jos Odaga Charles Okuthe and many more whose names we cannot include here. An interim office of Charles Okuthe (Chairman) and Bella Maguys (Secretary) organized the first ever rugby tournament in Kisumu which was ‘not too good not too bad ‘in October 1991."
"The same office later organized Kisumu RFC elections which saw a new office of Peter Openda (Chairman) and Paul Okullu (Hon- Secretary) take over, with most of the interim office bearers not seeking re-election."
"From 1991 to 1996, Kisumu steadily concentrated on building a strong foundation by taking part in tournaments such as the Great Rift Valley 10-aside in Nakuru and Mombasa’s Driftwood Sevens. This was by choice because of a small player base and financial limitations. At the same time, the Club hosted the Kisumu Ten-aside event held between 1991 and 1994. With a rich hinterland of players from Maseno School, St. Mary's School Yala, Nyang'ori High School, Moi University and Maseno University there was light at the end of the tunnel. Mombasa businessman Edwin Yinda donated playing kit to the team after the Driftwood finals contested between Mean Machine RFC and Kisumu."
"Kisumu RFC first came to the fore when they reached the Driftwood 7s in Mombasa in 1994 losing in sudden death to Mean Machine RFC. Come 1997, Kisumu again reached the Finals of the Driftwood 7s in 1997 losing to the United States International University Africa."
"It is a Sunday in June 1997 and the George Mwangi Kabeberi Memorial 7s is on at the Nairobi Railway Club. Kenya is playing, using the one-day event as preparation for the Tusker Safari 7s in a couple of week’s time. The squad is composed of Sammy Khakame, Paul Murunga, Tolbert Onyango, Ken Thimba, Gordon Anampiu, Felix 'Toti' Ochieng', Manuel Okoth, Steve Gichuki & Co. Kisumu RFC are also present and the players on show are Andrew Okwaro, Fred Jura, Frank Ndong' Steve Oloo, Issa Matan Issa, Moses Kola, Tony Lamba, Job Odonde and Dan Alego, Gordon Raila, Felix Oketch, Bob Bengo. Two weeks before at the driftwood sevens in Mombasa the lakeside outfit finished runners -up losing 19-7 to USIU-Africa."
"Kisumu had moved away from mere participation to competition and the rugby fraternity had taken notice. Expectations from both the playing unit and fanatics were high. Mean Machine RFC arrived and in the side was Eric 'Shaggy' Mwangi, Biko Ambesta, Ted Okinda, Ken Aswani, Kanyi Gitonga, Eric Musuva, Oyunga Pala, Kevin Matabutu, Sundiya Halwenge and Paul Okong'o."
"And the event kicked off and the usual winners and losers and it looked like a ""kawa"" event, till Kenya met Kisumu and there was fireworks. Kenya despite her constellation of international players with exposure in Selkirkshire, Dubai, Spain and Singapore struggled to beat Kisumu, but that was just round one. To the semis of the Main Cup and Kisumu again met Kenya while Mean Machine RFC played Nakuru RFC. Nakuru with Ben 'Benways' Otieno, Caleb Langat and the hard hitting and sometimes illegal play were too strong for Machine and that was the end for Machine."
"To the second semi and Kisumu versus Kenya and this was a nip and tuck battle. The crowd at the Railway Club was at full cry behind Kisumu. Tony Lamba after many years in the Ninja's outfit found a new life, and with a new team was in imperious form setting up, Jura, Okwaro, Kola and Co. However Kenya composed themselves and closed the match off to set up a final versus rift Valley side Nakuru. It was not Kenya's day as New winger Caleb Langat scored try after try, taking Kenya's winger's apart. Winners Nakuru RFC"
"By Monday of the new week, Call ups to Kenya, Andrew Okwaro and Fred Jura."
"A tour to Uganda in October saw them leave an indelible mark with their trademark hard running, tackling and skills level in a country which was just beginning to pick the game after a lull of over 20 years. The visitor's led 13-7 at halftime before the hosts recovered to win 47-13 in the second-half. This was a 'test' versus Uganda. Putting it mildly, 1997 marked the turning point for Kisumu Rugby. They did not look back and Kisumu became a fertile rugby nursery nurturing young players just out of school into mature club and national team material."
"Kisumu joined the Second division ESS in 1998 after winning the Bowl league in 1997. The ESS would prove tricky for Kisumu. The challenge came from two quarters, one depth in terms of players and two finances to honor 11 away games with most teams based in Nairobi. The league would be honored on and off between 1998 and 2002."
"Away from that the Management Board of Kisumu actively engaged the Union in trying to secure a future. In behind the scenes talks the Kisumu management Board asked the Union for one leg of the National Sevens Circuit. At talks in Moshi, Tanzania in December 2002 a hush-hush deal was done with the Hon-Secretary of the Union Richard Omwela who was scheduled to contest for the Chairmanship in a number of months."
"With Mount Kilimanjaro providing a spectacular backdrop, to the conversation he proposed a deal. In exchange for support from the Lakeside team at the election he agreed to give Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit. Present at the talks were Omwela, Aggrey Chabeda, John Akelola, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o. Kisumu also actively engaged Max Muniafu who was then Director for Development at the Union and argued for the same. Prior to Moshi talks were held with Max, David Akelola, Phillip Ocholla, Andrew Okwaro and Paul Okong'o at the Junction Inn restaurant in Kisumu to push for the same."
Surely enough one of the first acts by Omwela & Chabeda on their election as Chair and Secretary of the Kenya Rugby Football Union was to award Kisumu one leg of the National Sevens circuit in early 2003 by 'Executive order'.

The Brandywine Valley Railroad is a class III railroad operating in Pennsylvania.
"It was established in 1981 by the Lukens Steel Company to operate trackage at Coatesville, Pennsylvania and the neighboring town of Modena. It was acquired, with the rest of the Lukens properties, by Bethlehem Steel Corporation in 1998."
"The Brandywine Valley's main line was originally built by the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, largely following the Brandywine Creek, to connect Reading with Wilmington, Delaware. By the time of the Brandywine Valley's formation, the line had been abandoned north of Valley Station, just north of Coatesville. BVRY took over the line from this point, the site of an interchange with Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, south to Modena, below which the ex-W&N was owned by PennDOT and operated by a number of shortlines over the years."
"Under Bethlehem operation, BVRY took over operation of the Delaware Valley Railroad, then operating the remainder of the ex-Wilmington and Northern, in early 1999. This gave the railroad interchange access not only to Conrail at Coatesville (subsequently replaced by the Norfolk Southern Railway), but to CSX Transportation at the southern end of the line at Elsmere, Delaware. It also thus began to operate a connecting branch of the former Pennsylvania Railroad from Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, on the W&N, to Nottingham."
"After the acquisition of Bethlehem Steel's assets by International Steel Group in 2003, Brandywine Valley began to scale back its operations. The ex-PRR line, also known as the Octoraro line, was taken over in that year by the Morristown and Erie Railroad. In 2005, the ex-W&N line south of Modena was turned over to the East Penn Railroad, reducing the Brandywine Valley to its original extent."
"With the merger of ISG in 2005, the railroad and steel plant were taken over by Mittal Steel Company, which became ArcelorMittal in 2006."
"= = = Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland = = ="
"Victor Frederick William Cavendish-Bentinck, 9th Duke of Portland, (18 June 1897 – 30 July 1990), known as Victor Cavendish-Bentinck until 1980, was a British diplomat, businessman, and peer. He served as Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee during the Second World War and was British Ambassador to Poland between 1945 and 1947."
"Cavendish-Bentinck was born in Marylebone, London on 18 June 1897. He was the second son of Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck, whose father, George Cavendish-Bentinck, was a grandson of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland. Although formally Victor Cavendish-Bentinck he was known informally as Bill. Like other members of his family he informally dispensed with the name ""Cavendish"", being known simply as Bill Bentinck. He was educated at Wellington College."
"Queen Elizabeth II is also descended from the 3rd Duke of Portland through her maternal grandmother Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck. The Queen and the 9th Duke of Portland were third cousins, once removed."
"Cavendish-Bentinck did not pursue a university education, instead entering the diplomatic service in 1915 at the age of 18 before taking leave to fight with the Grenadier Guards in the First World War, returning to the Foreign Office in 1919. In 1922, he took charge of administrative arrangements for the Lausanne Conference. He served in the British Embassy in Paris and also in the League of Nations Department in the Foreign Office. Other postings included Athens in 1932 and Santiago in 1933. The high point of his diplomatic career came in 1939 when he was appointed chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee. He managed to develop the body as a highly effective instrument of government and, as a result, became counsellor to the Services Liaison Department of the Foreign Office in 1942."
"However, he cast doubt on reports that were received regarding the Nazi genocide of the Jews. In late August 1943 the Polish Embassy in London informed the British government of the deportation and annihilation of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Lublin and Bialystok provinces. The chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee, Victor Cavendish-Bentinck, deplored Polish and Jewish information about atrocities. He wrote this information as an attempt to ‘stoke us up’ He added: ‘I feel certain that we are making a mistake in giving credence to this gas chamber story.’ This error of judgement makes his subsequent appointment as ambassador to Poland the more surprising."
"In 1945, Cavendish-Bentinck was given his final diplomatic posting on his appointment as Ambassador to Poland. When visiting the formerly German City of Stettin (Szczecin) in 1946 he was invited to talk to German civilians suffering from months of internment so their possessions and property could be taken over by Polish resettlers from territories lost to the USSR. Cavendish-Bentinck refused to do so, ignoring certain inhuman circumstances under which mainly old people, women and children had to suffer, by noting to his Polish hosts, he was ""convinced that they will complain as usual""."
"He held the position for two years before the Foreign Office applied to appoint him Ambassador to Brazil. He never took up the latter post, being obliged to resign from the Foreign Office, without a pension, as a result of the publicity surrounding his divorce. Bentinck's aristocratic background attracted press attention; Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin, apparently sympathetic, remarked at that the time ""I could have saved him if his name had been Smith."""
"After his withdrawal from the diplomatic service, Cavendish-Bentinck embarked on a business career, becoming Vice-Chairman of the Committee of Industrial Interests in Germany. From this position, he was able to advance the interests of British companies such as Unilever. He was a member of the Steering Committee of the Bilderberg Group."
"In 1980 he succeeded his elder brother Ferdinand Cavendish-Bentinck as the 9th Duke of Portland. Upon his own death in 1990, the dukedom and the Marquessate of Titchfield became extinct because his only son had predeceased him and there were no other surviving male heirs of the 1st Duke. However, the earldom of Portland had been created in an earlier generation than the dukedom and there were surviving descendants in the male line to inherit it. That title was therefore inherited by his kinsman, Henry Noel Bentinck, who became 11th Earl of Portland, together with its subsidiary titles of Viscount Woodstock and Baron Cirencester. He was interred at the traditional burial place of the Dukes of Portland in the churchyard of St Winifred's Church at Holbeck."
"Bentick married Clothilde Bruce Quigley (died 1984), an American, on 16 February 1924. She was the daughter of James Bruce Quigley. They had two children together:"
Soon after World War II began Bentinck received a telephone call at his office from his Hungarian maid to tell him that his wife had left him and taken their children with her. They were finally divorced in 1948.
"Portland married secondly, Kathleen Elsie Barry (died 2004) on 27 July 1948. She was the daughter of Arthur Barry. This marriage produced one child:"

Instead, his claim was that these quantities tend to be constant when averaging the data over long periods of time.

"Dardilly, with its , includes three valleys oriented north south: the valley of ruisseau de la Beffe to the west, the valley of the ruisseau des Planches and the valley of the ruisseau de Serres to the east. Its altitude varies between 260 and 390 metres, allowing exceptional views over the , the Monts du Lyonnais and even on clear days the Alps, from Vercors to Mont Blanc."
"The Town also possesses 1.73 km of leafy forests of ones and of farmland. Many paths for walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers criss-cross these spaces:"
Bordering communes include:
"The name Dardilly may originate from the Gallo-Roman name Dardiliacus, if the town was founded in that period, but there is no historic proof for this hypothesis, although the remains of an aqueduct built by Claudius to bring the waters of the Brévenne River (a tributary of the Azergues, itself a tributary of the Saône) to Lyon have been found nearby. More likely, the name Dardilly originated at the time of its first surviving mention, in the 10th century cartulary of Ainay Abbey, which possessed several lands here."
"In the Middle Ages, the village, constructed on a mound, was made up of a church dedicated to Saint Pancras, an adjacent cemetery and about twenty houses. In 1210, at the time of the feudal wars, the Count of Beaujeu tried to seize the city of Lyon and its then archbishop, Renaud II de Forez, fortified Dardilly as part of his defence of Lyon by building a wall and ditch around the existing settlement."
"In the time of Jean-Marie Vianney - the late 18th and early to middle 19th centuries - Dardilly was an agricultural and wine-growing town, with some beautiful houses built by wealthy people from Lyons who spent the summer months here. The population was about 1500 inhabitants. At the end of the 19th century the vines were ravaged by phylloxera and many of the town's inhabitants left for Lyons to find work, bringing the population down to 982 in 1911. The vine-growers that remained went over to growing fruit."
In 1986 Pope John-Paul II visited Dardilly to see Vianney's birthplace on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth.
"The active population of Dardilly is 3546. Out of the employed residents of the commune, 25.6% work in Dardilly, 17.4% work in another TECHLID (Technopole économique de l'Ouest Lyonnais - Technopolis of West Lyonnais) commune, 52.3% work in another (non-TECHLID) commune within the département and 4.7% work outside the département."
Dardilly has several social action groups :
"The town had 1,700 buildings in 1982, compared to 2 821 buildings in 2005. Even though the town's buildings have remained very residential, with a majority being individually owned houses, many of its buildings are social housing."
"The 2 churches, Saint Jean-Marie Vianney et Saint Claude, make up the Catholic parish of Dardilly."

"Syracuse is served by two trains daily on the ""Lake Shore Limited"", four trains daily of the ""Empire Service"", and two trains daily on the ""Maple Leaf""."
"When the financially desperate New York Central Railroad sold off its elevated right-of-way through downtown Syracuse to the State of New York in 1962, all rail service was re-routed onto a former freight bypass to the north of the city center. The elevated line and train station had been in service for less than 30 years, having replaced tracks that ran at-grade through the center of Washington Street."
"From this time until the late 1990s, bus service remained at the former train station downtown, but with the former train route converted into Interstate 690 (a downtown freeway, in vogue among mid-century urban planners), rail passengers were forced to use a ""temporary"" structure near the freight yards in East Syracuse, opened on August 29, 1962. Both options proved decidedly unpopular, with the train station in particular becoming synonymous with Amtrak's many woes."
"Opened in 1998, the Regional Transportation Center replaced both venues, re-integrating bus and rail service for the first time since the early 1960s. There were provisions built for OnTrack, Syracuse's commuter train line built on the former Lackawanna right-of-way through Armory Square, to call at the station. However, a bridge that was intended to connect the two lines was never built after CSX claimed construction could destabilize its freight rail bridge, and the OnTrack program was axed due to low ridership. The station is named for William F. Walsh, a former mayor of Syracuse and representative in the U.S. Congress."
"The station is built at ground level, with bus loading/unloading areas in front of the main entrance, and stairs and an elevator leading up to the tracks, which are on an embankment. A central concourse with shops and a waiting room links the two areas. Trains call at a single high-level island platform serving one (nominally eastbound) track; provisions were made for cross-platform transfers with OnTrack on the other side, but the program was canceled before service ever reached the station."
"Fifteen CENTRO bus routes serve the Walsh Regional Transportation Center from Auburn, Fulton, Liverpool, Oswego, Phoenix, Skaneateles, Syracuse, and nearby areas."
"The most frequently serviced corridor is between the Regional Transportation Center and the Downtown Syracuse CENTRO Transit Hub (at Salina and Adams Streets), via Route Nos. 16, 46, 50, 116, 216, 316, and 550. Transfers to buses serving other routes may be made at Destiny USA or the Downtown Transit Hub. Standard local fares are $2.00 per person; with children aged 6-9, seniors 65+ and persons with disabilities at $1.00 per person. Children under 6 are free. Fares for the longer distance regional bus routes are on a zone basis, up to $4.00 each way per person for the Auburn (Aub36) line, and $5.00 for the Oswego (Osw46) line."

"Courthouses in New South Wales were designed by the Colonial Architect, later known as the Government Architect of New South Wales, Australia."
"The first New South Welsh Charter of Justice of 2 April 1787 created the power to convene a criminal court. This was the Court of Criminal Jurisdiction. The first Charter of Justice also created a Court of Civil Jurisdiction to hear and determine in a summary way all pleas relating to real and personal property, debts, contracts, grant of probates and to administer intestate estates. Magistrates appointed in the early years of the colony were unpaid honorary appointments. The first paid magistrate was D'Arcy Wentworth appointed in 1810."
"Local Courts were known as Courts of Petty Sessions. Such courts had originated in England in the fourteenth century. Although during the early years of the colony references are made to Courts of Petty Session sittings by Magistrates, it was not until 1832 that Courts of Petty Sessions were formally established in New South Wales."

= = = DCEThreads = = =
DCEThreads is an implementation of POSIX Draft 4 threads.
"DCE/RPC was under development, but the POSIX committee had not finalised POSIX threads at the time. The Open Group had to make a decision about what to stick with, and unfortunately the final POSIX threads were different from their selection."
"POSIX Draft 4 threads were limited to begin with (the final standard fixed these). Microsoft adopted DCE/RPC wholesale in Windows NT as MSRPC and also in DCOM. Most of the stability and reliability problems that programmers associate with DCOM services - especially memory leaks, exception handling problems and thread cancellation stability issues - can be traced back to the use of POSIX Draft 4 threads."
"DCE/RPC is sufficiently complex that the issue of updating it to solve and modernise the POSIX Draft 4 threading problem requires highly skilled and highly specific programming knowledge. Consequently, for all that it can accomplish, the reference implementation of DCE/RPC languishes due to a lack of information and resources."
"The key difference between POSIX Draft 4 threads and the final POSIX threads specification, aside from a number of functions being interruptible where others are not, is thread cancellation. DCE/RPC utilises thread cancellation to propagate signals across the ""Remote"" of RPC, such that for example a client application terminating a thread results in its corresponding thread on the server also being terminated in the same way. Unfortunately, the final POSIX specification does not include such sophisticated cancellation methodology, and, given the difficulties that the Unix vendors had in correctly implementing the POSIX threads specification, it is not surprising that it was removed."
"Linux, since the introduction of NPTL and the Linux 2.6 kernel, has proper support for thread cancellation."
DCEThreads now only realistically exists as an emulation layer.

"The Los Cerritos Center is a super regional shopping mall located in Cerritos, California. Since September 1971, the Los Cerritos Center has been an integral part of the city of Cerritos' tax revenue. The mall is the city's largest revenue source, producing $581 per square foot in sales ($296 million total) in 2010. The tax revenue generated from the Los Cerritos Center for its host city totals to approximately $3 million a year. The facility is owned by Macerich & GIC Private Limited."
"The Cerritos Redevelopment Agency initially invested $30 million for the development of the Los Cerritos Center area. The shopping area built at Gridley Road and South Street was developed by Ernest M. Hahn, Inc. in September 1971 with the Phase I opening of the corridor from The Broadway department store (currently Macy's) to Ohrbach's (first became a Mervyn's, currently a Forever 21) and J.W. Robinson's (became Robinsons-May in 1993) in addition to having an initial 150 specialty stores. Phase II followed in 1971 with the opening of the wing from Ohrbach's to Sears. In 1981, Phase III saw the opening of Nordstrom and its first wing. In November 1993, Phase IV was completed when the Palm Court Cafes debuted in the Center with 14 eateries."
"At its opening, the Los Cerritos Center was one of the area's first shopping malls and was noted for its high quality maintenance and complete climate-controlled environment."
"The original goal of the center was to bring thousands of dollars of sales tax revenue to the city of Cerritos. In its first four years, the city of Cerritos' retail sales grew tenfold, topping over $207 million in 1974."
"In 2015, Sears Holdings spun off its 235 properties, including the Sears at Los Cerritos Center, into Sertiage Growth Properties."
"Since the end of 2015, the center has been undergoing a large-scale renovation, which brought in new anchors such as Dick's Sporting Goods and Harkins Theatres, in-line stores, remodeled interiors, new furnishings and lighting, exterior landscaping, as well as art work and overall re-branding."
"The Macy's wing houses merchandise, confectionery, and services for the family, the main concourse holds more upscale fashion stores, restaurants and boutiques, and the Sears wing focuses on specialty shops in entertainment, younger consumers, as well as the newly renovated Dining Court."
"Forever 21, which opened in January 2010 from the old Mervyn's store, was the first flagship styled store for the retailer in the United States and opened to much acclaim."
"A brand new, relocated Nordstrom department store and wing opened in May 2010 on the site of a former Robinsons-May. The added wing made room for nine additional in-line shops and restaurants. The old Nordstrom site was demolished for redevelopment and is now the site of a 16-screen Harkins Theatres which opened in spring 2016, as well as The Cheesecake Factory, which opened in November 2015."
"Realizing the importance of multiculturalism and diversity in the region today, the Los Cerritos Center, in conjunction with the city of Cerritos, is home to the Festival of Friendship held every February. Cultural booths and performances are held annually with the goal of reaching out to the various diverse communities the center serves."
"In 2010, 8.5 million shoppers visited the mall with November 26 (Black Friday) marking the biggest day of the year with 79,682 visitors. The daily average attendance from January through November 2010 was 22,133 people a day. December 2010 saw an average of 35,631 a day. Los Cerritos Center is the most financially successful mall in the Southeast Los Angeles region."

= = = Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel = = =
"Friedrich Carl Albert Schreuel, also known as Frederik Karel Albert Schreuel and Jan Christian Aelbert Schreuel (14 June 1773 – 1853), was a Dutch-born painter."
"Schreuel was born in Maastricht, the Netherlands, on 14 June 1773. He joined the Dutch military at a young age. He is recorded as painting by 1788 and eventually left the military to begin studying art, first in Berlin then, in 1805, in Dresden. He spent some time studying under Josef Grassi of the Dresden Academy and soon made a name for himself by painting portrait miniatures. One of his portraits, known from an oval engraving by C. Bolt, was of Frederick IV, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. Schreuel would also copy works held at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. By 1840 he had been appointed a professor of painting by the King of Saxony."
"Schreuel is believed to have painted the portrait of the Javanese artist Raden Saleh, who was then studying in Europe, that is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. The painting dates to before 1841, because Saleh is depicted dressed as a European dandy, not as a Javanese prince, which was how he dressed beginning in that year. The painting was first recorded at the Dresden Academy exhibition, at which it was a critical success. However, it has also been attributed to Saleh himself; in 2005 the Rijksmuseum was still referring to the work as a self-portrait. The pose is one traditional in self-portraits, and no other portraits by Schreuel are known to have survived, while the style of his miniatures is different; however, this would be the only unsigned painting by Saleh, he knew Schreuel (whom he called 'Schruil'), and the brushwork is freer than is characteristic of his work. According to the Tropenmuseum, they have the only known self-portrait by Saleh."

= = = Ileocecal valve = = =
"The ileocecal valve (ileal papilla, ileocaecal valve, Tulp's valve, Tulpius valve, Bauhin's valve, ileocecal eminence, valve of Varolius or colic valve) is a sphincter muscle valve that separates the small intestine and the large intestine. Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the ileum. Approximately two liters of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve."
The ileocecal valve is distinctive because it is the only site in the gastrointestinal tract that is used for vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption.
"The histology of the ileocecal valve shows an abrupt change from a villous mucosa pattern of the ileum to a more colonic mucosa. A thickening of the muscularis mucosa, which is the smooth muscle tissue found beneath the mucosal layer of the digestive tract. A thickening of the muscularis externa is also noted."
There is also a variable amount of lymphatic tissue found at the valve.
The ileocecal valve has a papillose structure.
"During colonoscopy, the ileocecal valve is used, along with the appendiceal orifice, in the identification of the cecum. This is important as it indicates that a complete colonoscopy has been performed. The ileocecal valve is typically located on the last fold before entry into the cecum, and can be located from the direction of curvature of the appendiceal orifice, in what is known as the bow and arrow sign."
"Intubation of the ileocecal valve is typically performed in colonoscopy to evaluate the distal, or lowest part of the ileum. Small bowel endoscopy can also be performed by double-balloon enteroscopy through intubation of the ileocecal valve."
"Tumors of the ileocecal valve are rare, but have been reported in the literature."
"It was described by the Dutch physician Nicolaes Tulp (1593–1674), and thus it is sometimes known as Tulp's valve."
"The valve was also described in 1588 by Gaspard Bauhin—hence the name Bauhin's Valve or Valve of Bauhin—in the preface of his first writing, ""De corporis humani partibus externis tractatus, hactenus non editus."""
= = = Dino Alfieri = = =
Edoardo Alfieri (first name usually shortened to Dino; 8 December 1886 – 12 December 1966) was an Italian fascist politician and diplomat.
"Alfieri was born in Bologna. In 1911 he finished law studies and soon after joined the nationalist group formed by Enrico Corradini. A volunteer in World War I, he was critical of the merger between Corradini's group and Benito Mussolini's Partito Nazionale Fascista (PNF). Nonetheless, he was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies on the PNF list in 1924."
"Under Mussolini's government, Alfieri was assigned several tasks: between 1929 and 1934, he was co-director of the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, deputy secretary of the ""Corporazioni"", and deputy secretary for Press and Propaganda from 1935, assuming the duties of Minister Galeazzo Ciano during the latter's mission in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. When Ciano moved on to become Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dino Alfieri found himself appointed Minister of People's Culture in 1937, and declared himself to the Antisemitical racial segregation laws passed in 1938."
"He was Italy's envoy to the Holy See starting 7 November 1939, and five months later to Nazi Germany (where he often met Adolf Hitler). While there, he was constantly helping out Italian workers and consulate staff. As the war progressed and Italy needed help, he attempted to solicit material aid from Germany but despite assurances little came of it. When the war began to deteriorate for the Axis, he wrote communiques and expressed verbally to Mussolini that the Germans simply saw Italy as a buffer state from the encroaching allies and urged the Duce to seek peace with the allies while simultaneously assuring the Germans that Italy was not betraying them. He was urgently called to Rome in 1943 by members of the Grand Council in order to participate in a meeting. It is unclear as to whether he truly realized what was being proposed at the meeting. A member of the Grand Council of Fascism, he supposedly supported Dino Grandi's coup d'état in July 1943, that led to the fall from power of the Italian Fascist government after 21 years and the arrest of Mussolini. When the Wehrmacht occupied Italy (see Operation Achse), Alfieri fled to Switzerland to save his life."
"In January 1944, he was sentenced to death ""in absentia"" by a kangaroo court during the Verona trial. The Swiss government did not give him political asylum, but tolerated his attendance in Switzerland."
"On 12 November 1946, an Italian court stated his innocence; on 6 February 1947, an inquiry of the Italian Foreign Ministry ended. Then, he was officially pensioned off."

"Elizabeth of Carinthia (also known as Elizabeth of Tyrol; – 28 October 1312), was a Duchess of Austria from 1282 and Queen of Germany from 1298 until 1308, by marriage to the Habsburg king Albert I."
"Born in Munich, Bavaria, she was the eldest daughter of Count Meinhard of Gorizia-Tyrol, and Elizabeth of Bavaria, Queen of Germany, widow of the late Hohenstaufen king Conrad IV of Germany."
"Elizabeth thus was a half-sister of Conradin, King of Jerusalem and Duke of Swabia. Elizabeth was in fact better connected to powerful German rulers than her future husband: a descendant of earlier monarchs, for example Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, she was also a niece of the Bavarian dukes, Austria's important neighbors."
"She was married in Vienna on 20 December 1274 to Count Albert of Habsburg, eldest son and heir of the newly elected King Rudolf I of Germany, thus becoming daughter-in-law of the King of the Romans and Emperor-to-be. After Rudolf had defeated his rival King Ottokar II of Bohemia in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld, he invested his son Albert with the duchies of Austria and Styria at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg on 17 December 1282."
"Albert initially had to share the rule with his younger brother Rudolf II, who nevertheless had to waive his rights according to the Treaty of Rheinfelden the next year. Duke Albert and Elizabeth solidified their rule in what was to become the Habsburg ""hereditary lands"", also with the help of Elizabeth's father Meinhard, who in his turn was created Duke of Carinthia by King Rudolf I in 1286."
"Elizabeth was described as shrewd and enterprising, in possession of some commercial talents. The construction of the Saline plant in Salzkammergut goes back to her suggestion."
"Upon the death of Albert's father in 1291, the princes elected Count Adolf of Nassau German king, while Duke Albert himself became entangled in internal struggles with the Austrian nobility. Not until Adolf's deposition in 1298, Elizabeth's husband was finally elected King of the Romans on 23 June 1298. Two weeks later, Adolf was defeated and killed in the Battle of Göllheim. In 1299, Elizabeth was crowned Queen of the Romans in Nuremberg."
"On 1 May 1308 her husband was murdered by his nephew John ""the Parricide"" near Windisch, Swabia (in modern-day Switzerland). After Albert's assassination, Elizabeth had the Poor Clare monastery of Königsfelden erected at the site, where she died on 28 October 1312 and was also buried.

Before his NFL career, he played for Winston-Salem State University, where he also played collegiate basketball."
"Thigpen played infrequently in his first three seasons, but had a breakout year in 1994, catching 36 passes for 546 yards. Then in 1995, he made the Pro Bowl, catching 85 passes for 1,307 yards and five touchdowns, and assisting his team to Super Bowl XXX, where he recorded three catches for 19 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers 27–17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys. His tough style of play earned him the nickname ""Meatball,"" which was later changed to ""Phil"" when he joined the Oilers in 1998."
"Thigpen played only six games in the following season due to injuries, but made a full recovery in the 1997 season, catching 79 passes for 1,398 yards and 7 touchdowns and making his second Pro Bowl selection."
"In 1998, he signed a five-year, $21 million contract with the Oilers, which at the time was the highest known contract ever signed among wide receivers. He went on to play with them for the final three seasons of his career, assisting the team (now known as the Titans) to Super Bowl XXXIV in the 1999 season. Such a large contract for a wide receiver was a signal of the role which wide receivers would begin to play in the NFL. Thigpen retired after the 2000 season with 313 career receptions for 5,081 yards and 30 touchdowns.

"He made his professional sumo debut in March 1979 at the age of 15, after leaving junior high school. He was recruited by Kokonoe stable. In 1980 he adopted the ""shikona"" of Fujinomori, before switching to Takanofuji in 1984. He first reached ""sekitori"" status in March 1985 upon promotion to the second highest ""jūryō"" division, but could manage only 4 wins against 11 losses and was demoted back to the unsalaried ""makushita"" division. After winning promotion back to ""jūryō"" in January 1986 he made his debut in the top ""makuuchi"" division only two tournaments later in May 1986."
"Takanofuji was ranked in the top division for 33 tournaments, winning one special prize for Fighting Spirit. His two gold stars for defeating ""yokozuna"" were both earned against Futahaguro (who, as Koji Kitao, also turned to professional wrestling). Takanofuji had the advantage of belonging to a stable that included two ""yokozuna"", Chiyonofuji and Hokutoumi, which under sumo regulations meant he never had to face them in tournament play. However, his height of meant he had a higher centre of gravity than was ideal for a sumo wrestler, and he seemed to struggle when promoted above the mid ""maegashira"" ranks. Though he managed to reach the fourth highest ""komusubi"" ranking in July 1990 he could not maintain the rank, winning only two bouts there. He was demoted from the top division after the September 1991 tournament and announced his retirement in May 1992. His career coincided exactly with that of his stablemate Hokutoumi, who made his debut alongside him in March 1979 and also retired in May 1992. At Takanofuji's own request, it was the previous head of Kokonoe stable, ex-""yokozuna"" Kitanofuji, his long time coach, and not his successor, ex-""yokozuna"" Chiyonofuji, who performed the topknot cutting at Takanofuji's official retirement ceremony or ""danpatsu-shiki."""
"Takanofuji's most common winning ""kimarite"" were ""yori-kiri"" (force out), ""hataki-komi"" (slap down) and ""tsuki-otoshi"" (thrust over)."
"Reverting to his real name, he joined the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion in June 1993, making his debut in February 1994. Yasuda spent the majority of the 1990s as an undercard wrestler, primarily competing in opening matches or as the fall guy in tag team matches with wrestlers such as Shinya Hashimoto and Kensuke Sasaki, achieving little success. In late 2000, Yasuda, along with Kazuyuki Fujita, became somewhat of a pet project for Antonio Inoki, and both of them were sent to the United States to train in mixed martial arts. Yasuda returned to Japan soon after, and was victorious in his first fight against veteran Masaaki Satake at Pride 13. Yasuda's win helped further legitimise him as a pro wrestler in the eyes of Inoki, and this was rewarded with Yasuda reaching the semi finals of the 2001 G1 Climax, where he lost to Keiji Mutoh. After earning one win and one loss in MMA throughout 2001, Yasuda earned the biggest win of his career in December by choking out veteran Jerome Le Banner. His defeat of Jerome led to Yasuda's stock in New Japan skyrocketing almost overnight, and Yasuda soon found himself elevated from over the hill veteran to top title contender in early 2002. Yasuda earned the biggest win of his pro wrestling career on February 16, defeating Yuji Nagata in a tournament to win the vacant IWGP Heavyweight Championship. Yasuda held the title for 48 days, before dropping it to Nagata in April. In August 2002, Yasuda and Kantaro Hoshino formed their own faction, the Makai Club, a group of wrestlers primarily with MMA backgrounds who worshipped Antonio Inoki like a god. Yasuda was viewed as the leader of the group, and in early 2003 he partnered up with his second in command Kazunari Murakami to enter the IWGP Tag Team Championship #1 Contender Tournament. Despite losing to Jim Steele and Mike Barton in the final, an injury to Steele would give the title to shot to Murakami and Yasuda who unsuccessfully challenged Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Masahiro Chono on February 16. Having retired from MMA, the aging Yasuda's position in the New Japan card began to fall again, and in late 2004 he left the promotion. After leaving New Japan, he started making sporadic appearances for ZERO-ONE and Hustle."
"In October 2007 he reportedly attempted to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, using a yeontan. A friend however, interrupted the alleged attempt. He was hospitalized with fears of possible brain damage, but this proved not to be the case and he eventually made a return to wrestling. Speaking to ""Tokyo Sports"" Yasuda later denied attempting suicide, saying the poisoning was accidental. On January 11, 2011, Yasuda announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He wrestled his final match on February 4, 2011, in which he was defeated by Genichiro Tenryu."
"Though very past his prime physically, Yasuda made his transition to mixed martial arts as a NJPW representative in March 2001. He had his debut at the PRIDE 13 against similarly retired kickboxer and karate champion Masaaki Satake. Yasuda received damage and bled from his face, but he nullified most of Satake' attacks by rushing him through sumo techniques against the ropes every time they were separated. At the end, the unanimous decision was given to Yasuda for controlling the fight."
"Yasuda returned to MMA in the K-1 Andy Hug Memorial event, taking on Rene Rooze in a special rules match, but he lost via head kick KO at the third round. He would be more successful in December 2001, when he fought popular K-1 player Jerome Le Banner at an Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye event: Yasuda managed to take him down and submit him by pressing his forearm against Le Banner's throat, getting the biggest win of his MMA career."
"He would later lost to fellow NJPW wrestler Kazuyuki Fujita in an Universal Fighting-Arts Organization event. Yasuda then fought superheavyweight kickboxer Jan Nortje, but he had to retire from the match when he hurt a leg seriously. His last fight was a rematch against Rooze, losing the fight again, this time by TKO."
Yasuda's daughter Ayami was born in 1987 and is a model.

The definitions in the XML Information Set specification are meant to be used in ""other"" specifications that need to refer to the information in a well-formed XML document."
An XML document has an information set if it is well-formed and satisfies the namespace constraints. There is no requirement for an XML document to be valid in order to have an information set.
An information set can contain up to eleven different types of information items:
"XML was initially developed without a formal definition of its infoset. This was only formalised by later work beginning in 1999, first published as a separate W3C Working Draft at the end of December that year."
"Infoset recommendation Second Edition was adopted on 4 February, 2004. If a 2.0 version of the XML standard is ever published, it is likely that this would absorb the Infoset recommendation as an integral part of that standard."
"Infoset augmentation or infoset modification refers to the process of modifying the infoset during schema validation, for example by adding default attributes. The augmented infoset is called the post-schema-validation infoset, or PSVI."
"Infoset augmentation is somewhat controversial, with claims that it is a violation of modularity and tends to cause interoperability problems, since applications get different information depending on whether or not validation has been performed."
Infoset augmentation is supported by XML Schema but not RELAX NG.
"Typically, XML Information Set is serialized as XML. There are also serialization formats for Binary XML, CSV, and JSON."

It is a sequel to Singleton's 1984 seminal ""The Lords of Midnight"" and has similar game mechanics but adds more detail and complexity with the number of characters and locations increased."
"In ""Doomdark's Revenge"", the hero of the first game, Luxor the Moonprince, goes into the savage wastes of Icemark to save his son Morkin and defeat the evil Empress Shareth, daughter of his enemy Doomdark. Despite what the title suggests, Doomdark himself, who was killed in the first game, does not actually return in the sequel."
"Like its predecessor, ""Doomdark's Revenge"" was a major critical success and a commercial hit. It was supposed to be followed the sequel titled ""Eye of the Moon"" in 1989, which was never finished. Another sequel, """", was eventually released in 1995."
A novelisation of Doomdark's Revenge has been announced and is planned to be released towards the end of 2019
"The game has five factions to be recruited or fought: the Fey, the Barbarians, the Dwarfs, the Giants, and the Icelords. The main difference between this game and ""The Lords of Midnight"" is that the lords now all move and react independently, no longer content to sit in their castles and wait to be recruited. The enemy leader, Shareth, also moves around, attempting to recruit armies and lords to her cause, so a major part of the game involves recruiting sufficient forces to counter hers. This makes the relationship between lords very important, as some lords can only be recruited by certain others. Certain lords are vassals of certain others, and some may only be recruited by their lieges. Recruiting a liege does not, however, automatically recruit all his vassals, nor their respective vassals. Lords may also cooperate, recruit and fight each other independently, making the world much more dynamic than the previous game. There are many magic items to be found, most belonging to a single lord and having 'power in battle', as well as magic crowns, and the landscape and its features hold many surprises for the player."
"""Doomdark's Revenge"" reverses the first game's victory conditions by giving the computer only a single goal, the death of the main protagonist Luxor. The player has many possible levels of victory, ranging from the mere rescue of Luxor's son Morkin from Shareth's spell of enchantment and retreat to Midnight, to the complete destruction of Shareth and the safe return home of Luxor, Morkin, as well as Luxor's companions Rorthron and Tarithel."

At the local level, most cities and many villages have municipal police forces, park district police forces, and even local specialized police forces. Many colleges also have their own campus police that are often sworn police officers."
"In 2000, Illinois was ranked 4th in the U.S. in the number of full-time sworn officers with 321 per 100,000 persons, behind Louisiana (415), New York (384), and New Jersey (345). In this ranking, only New York had a higher total population than Illinois. Illinois is also near the top of most law enforcement numbers lists, such as number of agencies per state, number of agencies with special jurisdictions, and number of local police agencies. Even taking into account that Illinois is the fifth most populous state, many of the ratios are higher than more populated states."

= = = Nanosheet = = =
A nanosheet is a two-dimensional nanostructure with thickness in a scale ranging from 1 to 100 nm.
"A typical example of a nanosheet is graphene, the thinnest two-dimensional material (0.34 nm) in the world. It consists of a single layer of carbon atoms with hexagonal lattices."
Silicon nanosheets are being used to prototype future generations of small (5 nm) transistors.
Carbon nanosheets (from hemp) may be an alternative to graphene as electrodes in supercapacitors.
"The most commonly used nanosheet synthesis methods use a bottom-up approach, e.g., pre-organization and polymerization at interfaces like Langmuir–Blodgett films, solution phase synthesis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, CdTe (cadmium telluride) nanosheets could be synthesized by precipitating and aging CdTe nanoparticles in deionized water. The formation of free-floating CdTe nanosheets was due to directional hydrophobic attraction and anisotropic electrostatic interactions caused by dipole moment and small positive charges. Molecular simulations through a coarse-grained model with parameters from semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations can be used to prove the experimental process."
"Ultrathin single-crystal PbS (lead sulfur) sheets with micro scale in x-, y- dimensions can be obtained using a hot colloidal synthesis method. Compounds with linear chloroalkanes like 1,2-dichloroethane containing chlorine were used during the formation of PbS sheets. PbS ultrathin sheets probably resulted from the oriented attachment of the PbS nanoparticles in a two-dimensional fashion. The highly reactive facets were preferentially consumed in the growth process that led to the sheet-like PbS crystal growth."
"Nanosheets can also be prepared at room temperature. For instance, hexagonal PbO (lead oxide)) nanosheets were synthesized using gold nanoparticles as seeds under room temperature. The size of the PbO nanosheet can be tuned by gold NPs and concentration in the growth solution. No organic surfactants were employed in the synthesis process. Oriented attachment, in which the sheets form by aggregation of small nanoparticles that each has a net dipole moment, and ostwald ripening are the two main reasons for the formation of the PbO nanosheets. The same process was observed for iron sulfide nanoparticles."
Carbon nanosheets have been produced using industrial hemp bast fibres with a technique that involves heating the fibres at over 350F (180C) for 24 hours. The result is then subjected to intense heat causing the fibers to exfoliate into a carbon nanosheet. This has been used to create an electrode for a supercapacitor with electrochemical qualities ‘on a par with’ devices made using graphene.
"Metal nanosheets have also been synthesized from solution-based method by reducing metal precursors, including palladium, rhodium, and gold."

"SKEPP is a nonprofit organization emanated from the Belgian astronomical society, ""Vereniging voor Sterrenkunde"", and was founded in 1990 by, among others, Prof. Etienne Vermeersch, Prof. Willem Betz, Tim Trachet and Prof. Jean Paul Van Bendegem."
The goals of the organization are:
"SKEPP gets most of its funding from member fees. On the initiative of board member and former editor-in-chief Tom Schoepen, SKEPP has been publishing its own three-monthly magazine since 2000, ""Wonder en is gheen wonder"", a magazine for science and reason, which focuses on both pseudoscientific topics and topics related to the philosophy of science. The editors include Prof. Dr. Johan Braeckman (Ghent University), Dr. Griet Vandermassen (Ghent University), Geerdt Magiels and SKEPP founder Tim Trachet."
"In 2012, SKEPP hosted a series of lectures and discussions, featuring prominent scientists and philosophers, under the name Het Denkgelag, which has since grown out to become an independent non-profit that organises skeptical conferences. In 2015, SKEPP hosted the meant-to-be-yearly event ""Zomerschool Kritisch Denken"" (Summerschool Critical Thinking) aimed at educational professionals. Currently, SKEPP organises the monthly local editions of Skeptics in the Pub in Ghent, Antwerp and Leuven."
"Since 1996 SKEPP gives out annual awards to non-members: the ""Zesde vijs"" (the “Sixth Screw”) and the ""Skeptische Put"" (de “Skeptical Pit”)."
"The ""Zesde Vijs"" is awarded to ""someone who has distinguished themselves in the past year in spreading objective knowledge regarding pseudoscience and the paranormal, or who has made themselves noticed in the media by presenting a nuanced critical view or a thoroughly documented argumentation"". This prize has been awarded to, among others:"
"The ""Skeptische Put"" is awarded to ""someone who, according to SKEPP, has displayed exceptionally uncritical thinking and who has totally misunderstood the popularization of science and knowledge"". The ""Skeptische Put"" has been awarded to, among others:"
"Since its founding, SKEPP has become quite widely known via the Belgian media. They are often called upon to present their critical perspective on paranormal or pseudoscientific topics. In 2004 the organization made headlines when thirty skeptics at Ghent University conducted a “mass suicide” attempt by taking an overdose of homeopathically diluted snake venom, belladonna, and arsenic. The goal of this action was to demonstrate that homeopathic products contain no active ingredients. Additionally, the Belgian health insurance organization were accused of putting themselves above the law as commercial entities by reimbursing alternative treatments. According to SKEPP, by reimbursing alternative treatments, health insurance organizations will give the impression to the Belgian public that these are effective medications or treatments."
"In 2014, the Belgian court of appeal in Brussels proved SKEPP right against the appeal of the Dutch physician Robert Görter, who was called a quack by the organization in 2004."
"Since 1 October 2012 the organization has pledged to award the 1-million-euro ""Sisyphus prize"", to anyone who can demonstrate paranormal abilities under controlled conditions. This includes paranormal phenomena as well as homeopathy."

"Charles Richard ""Bubba"" Wells (born July 26, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player, playing mostly for minor leagues. He played collegiately for Austin Peay State University and was named 1997 Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year. Selected 34th by the Mavs in the 1997 NBA draft, the little-used small forward's NBA career was short-lived, consisting of just 39 games of the 1997–98 season. However, he did start two games in March 1998, in place of the injured Cedric Ceballos. His brief NBA career did feature one memorable game where he set the record for the shortest amount of playing time (less than 3 minutes) before fouling out, as part of a failed strategy to intentionally foul Dennis Rodman (a notoriously bad free throw shooter) to limit his scoring."
"His NBA career came to an abrupt end in 1998, after he was traded to the Phoenix Suns along with Martin Müürsepp, the draft rights to Pat Garrity, and a future first-round draft pick in exchange for point guard Steve Nash. Wells never played a game for the Suns. He was later traded to the Chicago Bulls, also for whom he never played. He later played for the LaCrosse Bobcats of the CBA, the Oklahoma Storm of USBL, the Memphis Houn'Dawgs of the ABA, and overseas in Greece and the Philippines. He played for the Harlem Globetrotters in 2004–05. From June 2005 through May 2015, Wells was an assistant men's basketball coach at Austin Peay."
"On May 28, 2015, his appointment to the staff of Jon Harris at SIU Edwardsville was announced."
"Bubba Wells holds the dubious distinction of being the player with the quickest disqualification due to personal fouls in an NBA regular season game. In a December 29, 1997 game against the Chicago Bulls, then-Mavericks coach Don Nelson employed a desperate tactic to limit the Bulls' offense. He inserted Wells into the game with the express purpose of fouling power forward Dennis Rodman, a notoriously poor free throw shooter, away from the ball."
"The plan failed, however, when Rodman hit 9-of-12 free throws and Chicago went on to win the game 111–105. Wells fouled out late in the third quarter after registering his sixth personal foul in a total of three minutes' playing time. This strategy of intentionally fouling a bad free throw shooter is sometimes called Hack-a-Shaq, since it was later famously used against Shaquille O'Neal."
"The previous record-holder was Dick Farley of the Syracuse Nationals who was disqualified in five minutes on March 12, 1956."
"In August 2007, Wells married Tracee Jones, the former head women's basketball coach at Tennessee State University. The previous summer Wells served as a supporter to Jones on NBC TV game show, ""Deal or No Deal"". Wells has a daughter, Alyiah, and a son, Chase."

"The Muttart Conservatory is a botanical garden located in the North Saskatchewan river valley, across from the downtown core in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. One of the best-known landmarks of Edmonton, the conservatory consists of three city-operated greenhouses, public gardens, as well as four feature pyramids for display of plant species found across three biomes, with the fourth pyramid hosting as a seasonal display. A fifth minor skylight pyramid lights up the central foyer."
"A donation from the Gladys and Merrill Muttart Foundation provided momentum for the conservatory's construction, with the remaining funding supplied by the Province of Alberta and the City of Edmonton. The conservatory is staffed and operated by the Edmonton Parks and Recreation Department."
"The conservatory's unusual structure, designed by architect Peter Hemingway, is composed of four glassed pyramids built around a central service core. The two larger pyramids are in area, and the two medium-sized ones are in size. Three of the pyramids are devoted to displays of plants from the tropical, temperate, and arid regions respectively, the fourth being used for shows that change with the seasons and which feature massed displays of ornamental flowering plants."
"The Temperate pyramid houses plants typical of temperate climates, from such zones as the southern Great Lakes, Australia, and even the mountainous areas of Asia. Near the entrance and fed by a stream is a bog area, with white water lilies and parrot's feather. The bog merges into a woodland with mostly eastern deciduous trees and low shrubs but including redwoods, cedars and pampas grass. Eucalyptus trees and flowering shrubs complement the Australian section. In the woodland floor and alpine section are many tiny flowering plants, some native to Alberta and others from all over the world. Carefully controlled environmental conditions allow the plants to go dormant in winter and burst into spring growth of green leaves and colourful blooms."
"The plants from the Arid pyramid come from hot and cold dry areas spanning five continents. They share an ability to thrive in environments with dry air, irregular moisture and wide day/night temperature fluctuations. In spring 2013, the Arid Pyramid featured an Agave Americana plant bloom which reached a height of 30 feet before reaching the top of the pyramid. This plant was planted a year after the Muttart Conservatory first opened."
"The Tropical pyramid provides an enormous diversity of species; under a canopy of tall palms, banana and weeping fig are orchids, various hibiscus and the bird of paradise. The plants come from tropical rainforests, evergreen forests or grasslands, and are often showy and bright. A waterfall cascades into the centre of the pyramid where small fish and water lilies make their home. This pyramid has also been home in the past to a kiwi bird and a sloth. On March 11, 2013, the bud to an imported Amorphophallus titanum plant (commonly known as the corpse flower) budded and bloomed here on April 22."

= = = Bye Bye Blues (film) = = =
Bye Bye Blues is a 1989 Canadian film. It was written and directed by Anne Wheeler and produced by Alberta Motion Picture Development Corporation with the assistance of Allarcom Limited.
"During World War II, Daisy Cooper (Rebecca Jenkins) returns home to her small Alberta town after she and her soldier husband, Teddy (Michael Ontkean), are split by the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong. While waiting for the war to end and to learn if Teddy is alive or dead, she joins a swing band as a singer to provide for her family, performing with them in many community halls. Daisy and her children initially live with her husband's parents, but later rent a house for themselves, as Daisy chafes under her in-laws' scrutiny. Daisy struggles to balance societal expectations of fealty and commitment to her children, while also struggling to financially support herself and her children by travelling and performing with the band. A trombonist in the band has a secret past and a not so secret yearning. Daisy struggles with an impossible choice as she hears that Teddy is returning home."
"Her husband's sister, a somewhat similar free spirit, befriends an Australian airman in Alberta to train in the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan."
"The cast also includes Luke Reilly, Leslie Yeo, Kate Reid, Wayne Robson, Robyn Stevan, and Stuart Margolin."
"The film was nominated for twelve Genie Awards at the 11th Genie Awards in 1990, and won three: Best Actress (Jenkins), Best Supporting Actress (Stevan), and Best Original Song (""When I Sing"" by Bill Henderson)."
"Springwater School in Starland County, Alberta, Canada was used as a set."
"There are a number of buildings in Alberta's Ghost Town - Rowley, Alberta."
This town's buildings were refaced and looks like a Hollywood movie set - hence its nickname Rowleywood.

= = = Dean Kiely = = =
Dean Laurence Kiely (born 10 October 1970) is a former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He is the goalkeeping coach at Premier League club Crystal Palace. He won eleven caps for the Republic of Ireland as a player. Kiely has previously worked as the goalkeeping coach at West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City.
"Born in Salford, Lancashire, Kiely trained with the West Bromwich Albion youth system as a schoolboy before being accepted into the FA School of Excellence at Lilleshall. After Albion he progressed through the Coventry City youth system as a trainee before signing a professional contract on 30 October 1987. He went to Ipswich Town on loan in November 1989 but failed to make any league appearances. Kiely joined York City on loan on 9 March 1990 before joining permanently in May, when he was given his first chance at regular first-team football. He made 210 league appearances for them between 1990 and 1996, and played in their 3–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford in the League Cup."
"Following a trial with Plymouth Argyle, Kiely signed for Bury on 15 August 1996 for a tribunal-decided fee of £125,000. He spent three seasons at Bury, making 137 league appearances in the process. He was instrumental in Bury winning the Second Division title in the 1996–97 season, most notably with an 88th-minute penalty save in the penultimate game of the season from Watford's Tommy Mooney. Bury requiring a point to guarantee a second automatic promotion in as many seasons had Kiely to thank after he kept the scoreline at 0–0 in a memorable day at Vicarage Road."
"Kiely moved to Charlton Athletic for a fee of £1 million on 26 May 1999 and made his debut on 7 August against Barnsley. He was Charlton's regular keeper from 1999 to 2005, and was popular with the club's fans as well as having a majestic ""shut out"" rate. Having been signed from a lower-division club he was seen as an example of Alan Curbishley's ability to spot talent in unheralded players. Kiely made a point-blank save from Birmingham City player Christophe Dugarry in a game at St Andrew's on 3 November 2003; Charlton went on to win the game 2–1 and Kiely later named the save as the favourite one of his career. He also saved a penalty from Crystal Palace's Andy Johnson to help secure a 1-0 win in December 2004."
"He signed for Portsmouth for an undisclosed fee on 25 January 2006, and played a large part in their escape from relegation that same season. His Pompey debut was in the FA Cup against Liverpool at Fratton Park in a 2–1 defeat. After David James signed for Portsmouth on 11 August, he voiced his frustration at having to compete with a top goalkeeper for the No. 1 spot, and with Jamie Ashdown also on their books, he opted to leave Portsmouth in the autumn."
He signed for Championship club Luton Town on a one-month loan
"on 23 November 2006, making his debut in the 2–1 away defeat at Southampton on 25 November. He then joined Championship side West Bromwich Albion on 30 January 2007, signing a one-and-a-half-year contract, as a replacement for Russell Hoult. Kiely made his Albion debut in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle the following day."
"Kiely reached the milestone of 700 senior career appearances on 1 September 2007, and recorded a clean sheet as Albion beat Barnsley 2–0. He signed a new deal with West Brom in January 2008, which would expire in June 2009. Kiely's clean sheet in the 3–0 home win against Plymouth Argyle on 1 March 2008 saw him named in the Championship Team of the Week.<ref name=""Team Of The Week (03/03/2008)""></ref> Later that month however, he was the subject of criticism and booing from his team's own fans during Albion's 4–3 victory over Colchester United, but retained his starting place. He nonetheless kept 18 clean sheets in all competitions to win the Championship Golden Glove award, while Albion won promotion to the Premier League as champions and reached the FA Cup semi-final. Since then, Kiely had to play second fiddle to England international Scott Carson. In spite of that, he was awarded a one-year extension at the club as a 'reward' from boss Tony Mowbray for his professionalism. And following an injury to Carson in training, Kiely was handed his first Premier League start against Wigan Athletic on 9 May 2009, producing some fine saves as the Baggies won 3–1 to keep their survival hopes alive, earning praise from Mowbray in the process. Mowbray was also quick to hail Kiely's professionalism throughout the season in handling his situation with dignity. That performance ensured that he kept his place for the club's final two games of the season, although he was unable to prevent relegation following a 2–0 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. On 24 May 2009 he kept a clean sheet in the club's final game against Blackburn Rovers as the match finished in a 0–0 stalemate."
"Since relegation to the Championship Kiely has once again had to be content playing second fiddle to Carson, who was named the new club captain by new manager Roberto Di Matteo, but on 8 December 2009 he made his first Championship appearance of the season as a replacement, coming on for the sent-off Carson and saving a penalty (though Peter Whittingham scored from the rebound) in a 2–0 home defeat to Cardiff City. He went on to play a run of three games while Carson sat through a suspension following his headbutting of Cardiff striker Michael Chopra, against QPR (2–2), Peterborough United (2–0), and Scunthorpe United (3–1). Kiely had also been performing the duties of goalkeeping coach following the retirement of former trainer Joe Corrigan, and in April 2010 was officially named goalkeeping coach of the club. On 18 April 2010, Kiely made his fifth appearance of the season as a half-time substitute for the injured Carson in a 2–0 home win over Middlesbrough. He retired as a player at the end of the 2010–11 season after West Brom opted against extending his contract, however he remained at the club as a coach. In January 2015, upon the appointment of new West Bromwich Albion manager, Tony Pulis, Kiely was released by the club. In March 2015, he was appointed Norwich City's goalkeeping coach."
"In September 2017, Kiely was appointed the goalkeeping coach at Championship club Preston North End."
"In January 2018, Kiely joined Premier League club Crystal Palace as goalkeeping coach."
"Kiely played for England at under-15 (13 caps), under-16 (13 caps) and under-18 (four caps in 1988) levels. He made one appearance for Republic of Ireland B, starting in a 4–3 win over League of Ireland XI on 9 February 1999, in which he was substituted for Nick Colgan. He went on to represent the Republic of Ireland at full international level, earning his first cap as a substitute in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-off against Turkey in November 1999. He retired from international football in February 2003, but in April 2008 Ireland's assistant manager Liam Brady suggested that Kiely could make a return to the squad. The rumours were then confirmed when he returned to the Ireland squad in Giovanni Trapattoni's first squad as manager in May 2008. He won his first cap in five years when he appeared in the Republic's 1–1 draw with Serbia that month, playing the full 90 minutes. On 28 May 2009, he walked out of the Ireland squad after Trapattoni informed him that he would be replacing Shay Given with Keiren Westwood for the second half of the friendly International against Nigeria at Craven Cottage on 29 May. He was capped 11 times by the Republic of Ireland, last appearing in 2008."
"He has played important roles in some of Marvel's major storylines, such as """" (1992), ""Maximum Security"" (2001), and ""War of Kings"" (2009). During the ""Heroes Reborn"" era (1997), he starred in the three-issue ""Imperial Guard"" miniseries."

"Kallark is a member of the Strontian race, and was born under Shi'ar rule. All Strontians are born with the capacity for great strength and various superpowers, but can only use them when they are completely devoted to a purpose. Fearing a Strontian rebellion, the Shi'ar emperor ordered Kallark, among other Strontians, to kill the Strontian elders. Only Kallark was devoted enough to carry out the order, and the others were killed when their wavering commitment rendered them weak. As a reward for his actions, Kallark was named the Praetor (leader) of the Shi'ar Imperial Guard."
"When the X-Men come into conflict with the Shi'ar empire regarding the Phoenix entity, Gladiator battles them first at the command of Emperor D'Ken, and then at the behest of his successor, Empress Lilandra Neramani.

"After thwarting an assassination attempt on Lilandra, Gladiator plays a role in temporarily turning Earth into an intergalactic prison."
"Gladiator battles Thor at the request of Zarrko, but is defeated. He later came looking for the X-Men to help him fight against the Phalanx; however, his aggressive arrival led him to blows with the X-Men's Cannonball, and while he was defeated by the young mutant, he managed to get the help of several X-Men in stopping the invasion. Some time later, on Lilandra's orders, Gladiator returns to Earth and attacks the X-Men's home, but later learns that Lilandra was possessed by Cassandra Nova and frees her."
"Liladra sends Gladiator to infiltrate the Kyln, an intergalactic prison, as a prisoner. He investigates rumors of a prisoner with the aid of Thanos and Star-Lord. The prisoner turns out to be an amnesiac Beyonder. Guided by the cosmic entity Living Tribunal, Gladiator fights the Champion of the Universe in an attempt to liberate the population of a planet the Champion had enslaved."
"At the request of Lilandra, Gladiator returns to Earth on a mission to capture the Uni-Power and bring it back for evaluation. After an encounter with the Invisible Woman of the Fantastic Four, Gladiator invites the Uni-Power to return to the Shi'ar Empire as their guest. Although the Uni-Power agrees, it is captured en route by Krosakis, an energy leeching warlord who forces the Uni-Power into his body to become Captain Universe. Gladiator attempts to stop Krosakis but fails, with the warlord finally beaten by the Silver Surfer."

After Hyōga leaves, however, Eri becomes powerfully attracted to the shooting star and wanders alone into the woods, where she finds a golden apple. She is then possessed by Eris, the Goddess of Discord, and kidnaps Athena, planning to use the golden apple to suck her energy out, fully reincarnate and take over the world.

Some days later, Saori, Seiya, Shiryū and Shun are wondering about Hyōga and decide to go to Asgard to investigate. At Valhalla, the Lord of Asgard, Dolbar, says he has not heard of any Hyōga and neither has his right hand, Loki. However, at all times Seiya and the others can feel an evil cosmo emanating from Loki and the other Odin Saints called God Warriors. Shiryū, in particular, notices a familiar cosmo coming from Midgard, a mysterious, masked God Warrior. Dolbar makes it clear that he is trying to take control of both Asgard and the Sanctuary, imprisoning Athena in a strange dimension within the giant statue of Odin. Midgard reveals himself as Hyōga and tries to kill Shiryū to prove himself to Dolbar. Thus, it is the task of the Bronze Saints to defeat Dolbar, Loki and the rest of the God Warriors, to save Athena and Hyōga."

"Athena receives the visit of Phoebus Abel, her older brother and God of the Corona. He informs her that he has come to destroy humanity as punishment for their corruption, just as it was done in ancient times. He dismisses Seiya and the Bronze Saints, as she will now be guarded by Abel's three Corona Saints, Atlas of Carina, Jaow of Lynx and Berenike of Coma Berenices, and the five resurrected Gold Saints who died in the Sanctuary battle: Saga of Gemini, Deathmask of Cancer, Shura of Capricorn, Camus of Aquarius and Aphrodite of Pisces. When Athena rebels against Abel's plan, he attacks her, sending her soul to Elysion, the final resting place from which there is no return. The Bronze Saints immediately rush to the Sanctuary to save her and ultimately overcome Abel."

The soundtrack was composed by Seiji Yokoyama and released in the Saint Seiya Original Soundtrack VIII – Warriors of the Final Holy Battle CD.
"After the success of the OVA series ""Hades - Chapter Sanctuary"", this movie served as a continuation to the Hades saga. Injured after his confrontation with Hades, Seiya is in a coma and under Saori's care. The Goddess Artemis, Saori's older sister, comes to Earth to ask why she is not fulfilling her duties as a Goddess and takes control of Sanctuary in her stead. Hoping that it may bring peace on Earth, Saori goes to the Sanctuary and starts spilling her blood and it is up to the Bronze Saints to save her."
"After the bloody battle against Hades, goddess Athena's Saints are still recovering when they find themselves face to face with their newest and most formidable foe: the dreadful goddess Artemis, accompanied by her Angels. Artemis replaces Athena as the Earth guardian deity and takes over the Sanctuary, turning Athena's Saints into her servants."
"Upon invading the Sanctuary, the Bronze Saints learn that Athena was banished by Artemis and decide to fight the moon goddess in order to rescue their true goddess and free the Earth from Artemis's ominous control."
"The movie focuses mostly on Seiya and Athena, as the other Bronze Saints are not seen as much; they only appear during their respective fights with the other Angels, and briefly towards the end. However, Eagle Marin also appears, as Ophiuchus Shaina, Unicorn Jabu, and Hydra Ichi do, though the latter three are just cameos."
"The movie also has a very ambiguous ending, with many plot points and danglers unresolved."

= = = BBC Regional Programme = = =
"The BBC Regional Programme was a UK radio broadcasting service which was on the air from 9 March 1930 – when it replaced a number of earlier BBC local stations – until 1 September 1939, when it was subsumed into the BBC Home Service, two days before the outbreak of World War II."
"When the British Broadcasting Company first began transmissions on 14 November 1922 from station 2LO in the Strand, Westminster, London, which it had inherited from the Marconi Company (one of the six commercial companies which created the BBC), the technology did not yet exist either for national coverage or for joint programming between transmitters. Whilst it was possible to combine large numbers of trunk telephone lines to link transmitters for individual programmes, the process was expensive and not encouraged by the General Post Office as it tied up large parts of the telephone network. The stations that followed the establishment of 2LO in London were therefore autonomously programmed using local talent and facilities."
"By May 1923, simultaneous broadcasting was technically possible, at least between main transmitters and relay stations, but the quality was not felt to be high enough to provide a national service or regular simultaneous broadcasts."
"In 1924, it was felt that technical standards had improved enough for London to start to provide the majority of the output, cutting the local stations back to providing items of local interest."
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 1 kW.
Each of these stations broadcast at approximately 120 W
"On 21 August 1927, the BBC opened a high-power mediumwave transmitter, 5GB, at its Daventry site, to replace the existing local stations in the English Midlands. That allowed the experimental longwave transmitter 5XX to provide a service – which eventually came to be called the BBC National Programme – programmed from London and available to the majority of the population."
"By combining the resources of the local stations into one regional station in each area, with a basic sustaining service from London, the BBC hoped to increase programme quality whilst also centralising the management of the radio service. This was known as ""The Regional Scheme""."
The local transmitters were gradually either converted to a regional service relay or closed entirely and replaced by high power regional broadcasts. Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX; initially these were on three separate frequencies and programming included some local variations. As the regional network expanded these transmissions were fully synchronized with those from Brookmans Park.
A relay station for Brookmans Park on 1402 kHz was due to open at Acle near Norwich in 1940. Construction was postponed by the outbreak of war. The station was never completed and was replaced by one at Postwick.
"Upon the outbreak of World War II, the BBC closed the Regional and National Programmes and replaced them with a single channel known as the BBC Home Service. The transmitter network was synchronized on 668 and 767 kHz in order to use the other frequencies for propaganda broadcasts in foreign languages. Each transmitter group would be turned off during an air raid to prevent their signals being used as navigational beacons and listeners were required to retune to a low-powered single-frequency network on 1474 kHz."
"On 29 July 1945, within 12 weeks of VE Day, the BBC reactivated the Regional Programme, but kept the name ""BBC Home Service"". The National Programme was also reopened under a new name as the BBC Light Programme."
"Both the National Programme and the Regional Programme provided a mixed mainstream radio service. Whilst the two services provided different programming, allowing listeners a choice, they were not streamed to appeal to different audiences, rather, they were intended to offer a choice of programming to a single audience. While using the same transmitters, the National Programme broadcast significantly more speech and classical music than its successor, the Light Programme. Similarly, the Regional Programme broadcast much more light and dance music than its successor, the Home Service."

"A makeup brush is a tool with bristles, used for the application of makeup or face painting. The bristles may be made out of natural or synthetic materials, while the handle is usually made out of plastic or wood. When cosmetics are applied using the appropriate brush, they blend better into the skin."
"There is a large variety of shapes and sizes of makeup brushes, depending on the face area where makeup will be applied, the cosmetic product and the wanted result. For example, the shape of the brush tip can be chiseled, straight, angular, round, flat or tapered."
Makeup application can alter due to the materials used to create a brush. The bristles of a makeup brush can either be synthetic or natural. The brush itself is important to the application of makeup as it can densely pack on product or loosely pack on product.
"Synthetic bristles are the most common material used in makeup brushes. These brushes are widely found in drugstores and makeup-specific stores. The bristles are made out of plastic, nylon, or other synthetic fibers, and may be dyed. Synthetic bristles are often used with liquid and cream products, as they tend to blend out products more easily and will not absorb product as much as a natural bristle brush. Synthetic brushes are cruelty-free. Synthetic brushes usually last longer than natural haired bristles as they do not degrade and are not as fragile."
"The natural bristles are often dark in color, not super soft, sheds, hold pigments better and difficult to wash. As the natural bristles are very porous they pick up more pigments and distributes them evenly. The natural bristled brushes best applies powder products and it is best to avoid liquid or cream products as they will drink up most of the products. Although natural bristles are more preferred in the cosmetic industry, the bristles themselves can cause allergic reactions to the animal hair."
"Natural bristles may more easily control the product when blending out or even packing on a product, because they have hair cuticles."
= = = Kabuki brush = = =
"A kabuki brush (sometimes called mushroom brush) is a makeup brush with a short stem and dense bristles. The brush head is most often rounded, though it can also be flat. Traditionally, the bristles are made of natural materials like animal hair (e.g., goat or horse hair), but most brushes available now on the market have synthetic bristles."
"It is named after the Kabuki Japanese drama theater where actors wear ""Keshō"", a very heavy makeup that emphasizes the nature of their characters. There, the kabuki brush is used to apply the white rice powder uniformly on the entire face."
"Usually, a kabuki brush is used to apply loose powdered make-up on large surfaces of the face (e.g., foundation, face powder, blush). Because of its design, the brush blends powdered make up evenly on the skin and creates a very natural looking coverage."
= = = St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia = = =
St. Josaphat Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia is located in the Manayunk section of Northwest Philadelphia at 124 Cotton Street. This parish was merged with those of St. John the Baptist and St. Mary of the Assumption in 2012.
"The church was named in honor of Saint Josaphat, who was born circa 1580 as John Kuncevic in Vladimir, a village of the Lithuanian Province of Volhynia (then a part of the Polish Kingdom begun under the Jagiellonian dynasty), and who rose to increasing positions of authority within the church after professing his faith. Murdered in Vitebsk (Belarus) on November 12, 1623 while working to reunify the diocese he had been assigned to lead, he was declared ""Blessed"" by Pope Urban VIII in May 1643. He was then canonized as a saint on June 29, 1867 by Pope Pius IX and, on the tercentenary of his martyrdom (November 12, 1923) was declared by Pope Pius XI to be the heavenly Patron of Reunion between Orthodox and Catholics."" On November 25, 1963, during the Second Vatican Council, the remains of Saint Josaphat were officially laid to rest at the altar of St. Basil in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. This action was ordered by Pope John XXIII."
"St. Josaphat's parish was founded in 1898. According to historians at the Polish American Liturgical Center in Orchard Lake, Michigan:"
"""Polish Immigrants looking to better themselves financially, settled where there was more work. In the section of Philadelphia called Manayunk, there was a great need for workers in steel, wool and paper plants. Towards the end of the 19th Century near the Schuylkill River, there was a large steel plant under the name of American Bridge Co. later called Penncoyd Iron Works who employed many of these hard working Poles. The Poles living in Manayunk were very happy with their employment, but a little saddened by the fact that they had no Polish Church of their own to which they could go to and pray to God, to sing in their native tongue and to thank God for the graces given them. The nearest Polish Church which they attended was so many miles away, and travel in those days was hard, because the Mother Church, St. Laurentius, was located in the part of Philadelphia called 'Fishtown.'"
"Representatives of the Local Group appealed to the Diocesan Authorities for permission to establish a Polish Church for the Polish People. Archbishop Ryan in 1898 sent Rev. Mieczyslaus Kopytkiewicz to organize the Parish. The first services were held in St. John's Lower Church. (Incidentally, the services were held here also when the present new church was being built.)"""
"The Rev. Henry Chajencki was then placed in charge of the parish in December 1898. Under his leadership, church leaders paid $25,000 for the old Fourth Reformed Presbyterian Church building on the corner of Silverwood and Cotton, and also purchased ""a double home on Grape Street that served as a Rectory and later as a Convent"" as they worked to grow their number of parishioners. A 36-year-old in failing health, Father Chajencki died on Christmas Day in 1900, and was buried in St. John's Cemetery. The Rev. Dr. Thomas Misicki served briefly as the parish's pastor until the Rev. Benedict Tomiak could formally take charge of the post. All three men had been residents of Mt. Carmel, Pennsylvania."
"Father Tomiak, who had been ministering to the poor as a member of the Congregation of the Missionary Fathers of Saint Vincent de Paul when he was drafted into the military and sent to the front to nurse soldiers during the Franco-Prussian War, and had been ordained in 1893 at the age of 50 after resuming his studies in Rome post-war, had emigrated to America shortly thereafter. Following seven years of service in Shamokin and Mt. Carmel he was appointed to his position at St. Josaphat's on January 20, 1901. During his 11-year tenure, he launched a parish parochial school (soon after arriving) and invited the Bernardine Sisters in as faculty, and founded two orphanages (one in West Conshohocken and the other in his native Wolsztyn). As the parochial school's student population grew, the Bernardines were replaced by the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception from New Britain, Connecticut (c. 1905-1910) and then the Sisters of Nazareth (c. 1910-1911)."
"Following the aging Father Tomiak's transition to a new role as Chaplain of the Orphanage, the Rev. Paul Guzik arrived from Matopolska to take over Tomiak's role as head of the parish. Soon after beginning work, Guzik determined that the existing school building was no longer adequate, raised $40,000 to build a ""yellow brick eight-room school,"" and then invited the Bernardine Sisters to return as faculty before making the decision to return to Poland. He was succeeded in 1913 by the Rev. Joseph Poremba, of St. Casimir's Parish of Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania. Both the school and the parish flourished under Poremba's leadership, which ended when he died suddenly from a heart attack in 1920. He was then succeeded in June of that year by the pastor of St. Stanislaus in Shenandoah, Pennsylvania, Rev. Louis Stachowicz, who went on to lead St. Josaphat's for nearly four decades. Among his successes were the addition of 12 classrooms to the school building between 1927 and 1928, the launch of high school classes in 1939 (the first Polish pastor to achieve this milestone), the construction of a new, $130,000 rectory in 1949, and the construction of a new church building at the corner of Silverwood and Cotton streets with a spacious hall below the structure, which was dedicated on March 16, 1958 by the Most Reverend John F. O'Hara, C.S., D.D., Archbishop of Philadelphia."
"Following Father Stachowicz's death on February 10, 1960, the Rev. John Sielecki of St. Stanislaus Parish became the new parish head. Prior to his death on August 3, 1967, he was able to inspire his congregation to build a new convent for the sisters who served the parish and pay off the high school's tuition debt. Sielecki was then succeeded by another St. Stanislaus priest, the Rev. Paul A. Lambarksi, who immediately set to work improving the school's heating and lavatories after beginning work in October 1967. In short order, he was also actively engaged in preparing for the church's Diamond Jubilee (75th anniversary)."
"In 1973, St. Josaphat's became the fourth Polish parish in the Archdiocese of Philadelphia to celebrate its 75th anniversary Diamond Jubilee."
"On 23 October 2014, Connecting Sydney was announced as the preferred bidder. The contract was finalised in December 2014, when it was also announced that the consortium had been renamed ALTRAC Light Rail, and that the opening date had been brought forward to early 2019. The contract also included the operation and maintenance of the Inner West Light Rail from mid-2015."
"Major construction commenced on 23 October 2015, beginning in the section of George Street between King and Market Streets. To minimise disruption along the length of the corridor, works were staggered across 31 construction zones. The first section of track in the CBD was laid in December 2016, by which time a total of 410 metres of track had already been laid across the project. This increased to around 5 kilometres of track by May 2017. By October 2017, track installation reached the halfway mark, with 12,000 metres of track laid at 23 of the 31 zones along the alignment."
"The CBD and South East Light Rail required significant changes to the bus networks of the Sydney central business district and the Eastern Suburbs. Prior to construction of the light rail, Hillsbus and State Transit bus routes using George Street were permanently removed from the street. The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey."
"To accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including Elizabeth, Castlereagh, Park, Druitt, Clarence and York Streets. Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as Railway Square, Queen Victoria Building and King Street Wharf. A small number of routes were either combined so that they run through the CBD without terminating, removed from the CBD entirely or completely discontinued."
"Construction suffered from significant delays. Major construction of the project was due to conclude in April 2018, though finishing works were to continue for some time after."
"Delays at two zones in the CBD were announced in August 2016. Originally meant to be completed before Christmas 2016, construction work at these zones was to continue for several months longer than originally anticipated. The zones were eventually opened around a year after the planned completion date. Further delays to the project arose during 2016."
"By the beginning of 2018 the whole project was significantly behind schedule. In March 2018 – one month before major works were originally due to be completed – the Transport Minister declined to put a date on when he expected construction of the line to be finished, but noted the government was ""an unhappy customer"" of the ALTRAC consortium."
The relationship between the New South Wales Government and Acciona Infrastructure – the construction company delivering the line – had deteriorated with a dispute arising between the parties over costs incurred from modifications to the line's design. Acciona commenced legal action against the government in April 2018. The company is seeking additional payments totalling $1.2 billion. Later in the month ALTRAC told the government it was working towards a completion date of March 2020.
"In October 2018, Acciona announced further delays to the project, stating that it would not be completed until May 2020."
"In June 2019, TfNSW and ALTRAC (including Acciona) reached an agreement to resolve their commercial issues and legal claims. As part of the agreement, the PPP was extended to 2036, with the government to pay up to $576 million over the duration of an extended PPP term, and ALTRAC shareholders to invest additional equity into the project to meet costs. The settlement package resolved over $1.5 billion of legal claims between TfNSW and ALTRAC, and Acciona withdrew its $1.1 billion legal misrepresentation claim against the government. The agreement also included milestone and incentive payments for light rail services to commence in two stages, with target start dates of December 2019 between Randwick and Circular Quay, and March 2020 between Kingsford and Circular Quay."
"Separate to the light rail budget, Randwick City Council earmarked $68 million to partially mitigate the impacts of the light rail. Projects include replacing some of the car parking spaces that were lost, especially in Kingsford, works to improve traffic flow in the district and public domain works."
"The City of Sydney planned to provide $220 million towards the light rail project. This would include money for public domain works on George Street and surrounding laneways. The centrepiece of these works was to be a large arch structure known as Cloud Arch located outside the Sydney Town Hall, however it was cancelled in late 2018 after cost blowouts. Cloud Arch would have acted as a gateway to the pedestrian section of George Street, with trams passing underneath it."
"In February 2018, testing of the line commenced on a short section of the Randwick branch along Alison Road. Testing along the rest of the Randwick branch and the main line to Circular Quay was achieved in August 2019, while the Kingsford branch, which will open three months later than the rest of the line, commenced testing in October 2019."
There have been criticism of the project from some parties:
"The first L2 passenger service between Circular Quay and Randwick commenced just after 10 AM on 14 December 2019. The opening weekend (14 and 15 December 2019) was fare-free, and 115,000 people used the new tram service during the opening weekend. The launch of the service on 14 December was interrupted by a tram which broke down at Circular Quay around 2:30 PM in the afternoon, within hours of the official opening ceremony. Services were restored by 3:30 PM."
"L3 passenger services between Circular Quay and Juniors Kingsford will commence in March 2020. In the interim until then, to maintain the frequency of light rail services in the CBD, L2 services run between Circular Quay and Central Chalmers Street. When the Kingsford branch opens, these services are expected to continue beyond Central Chalmers Street towards Juniors Kingsford as L3 services."
"The project's Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) released in 2013 proposed a redesigned bus network in the CBD and the Eastern Suburbs. Some bus routes which were diverted from George Street to other streets during the construction, were proposed to terminate at Railway Square with their passengers to join the Light Rail while others will be rerouted permanently to the streets to which they were diverted. Twenty bus routes were proposed to be withdrawn or curtailed between Kingsford/Randwick and Railway Square/Circular Quay. A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the University of New South Wales to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus."
The proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:
"Some bus changes had been made to bus routes in the list since 2013. For example, route 343 currently runs as a through route between Kingsford and Chatswood without terminating at the CBD, and UNSW routes had been reconfigured as bus routes 891, 893 and 898."
The final bus network will be announced in due time and changes to bus services will be implemented four to six weeks after the commencement of L3 Kingsford Line services in March 2020.
"As a member of the ALTRAC Light Rail consortium, Transdev will operate the line until the end of the PPP, set to end at 2036. Services on the Randwick branch are numbered L2 and services on the Kingsford branch are numbered L3."
"The service is operated by 60 five-section Alstom Citadis X05 trams operating in coupled pairs. The first was completed in May 2017, arriving at the Randwick depot on 28 July 2017."
"The line commences outside Circular Quay station heading west on Alfred Street, before proceeding south down George Street, then east via Rawson Place and Eddy Avenue, and south via Chalmers Street to Central station. It then continues east via Devonshire Street over the Eastern Distributor and under Moore Park and Anzac Parade via a tunnel before heading south via the former bus right of way. At the intersection of Anzac Parade and Alison Road the splits into two branches, L3 (to open in March 2020) continues down Anzac Parade to terminate outside the South Sydney Junior Rugby League Club at Kingsford, and the L2 branch goes to Randwick via Alison Road, Wansey Road and High Street."

The line includes the following stops:
"The Circular Quay stop serves the locality of Circular Quay at the northern end of the Central Business District. The stop is on Alfred St between Pitt and Loftus Streets. The area has an established role as a transport interchange and is already served by buses, trains and ferries. The stop comprises one island platform and one side platform."
"The Bridge Street stop, known as Grosvenor Street during development, is located on George Street, near the intersections with Bridge Street and Grosvenor Street. The design includes an island platform. The design originally included two side platforms but was switched to an island platform to retain the existing dedicated left-hand turning lane from George Street into Grosvenor Street."
"The Wynyard stop serves the locality of Wynyard. The stop is located at the northern end of the George Street pedestrian zone, adjacent to the entrance to Wynyard railway station. The design includes two side platforms."
"The QVB stop, known as Queen Victoria Building during development, is located on George Street south of Market Street and adjacent to the Queen Victoria Building (often abbreviated QVB), a shopping centre from which the stop takes its name. The design includes two side platforms."
"The Town Hall stop is located at the southern end of the George Street pedestrian zone, adjacent to St Andrew's Cathedral. It is named after Town Hall railway station and the Sydney Town Hall. The stop will consist of two side platforms."
"The film was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and numbered 641–659 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as an ""Invraisemblable équipée d'un groupe de savants de la Société de Géographie incohérente; pièce fantastique nouvelle en 40 tableaux"". (The optional supplementary section was sold separately and numbered 660–661.)"
"""The Impossible Voyage"" was one of the most popular films of the first few years of the twentieth century, rivaled only by similar Méliès films such as ""The Kingdom of the Fairies"" and the massively successful ""A Trip to the Moon""."
The film critic Lewis Jacobs said of the film:
= = = Béjar = = =
"Béjar () is a town and municipality in the province of Salamanca, western Spain, part of the autonomous community of Castile and León. It had a population of 15,016 as of 2017."
"The first inhabitants of what is now Béjar were the Vettones who settled an area to the south of the city now known as ""La Antigua"" around 400 BC. The city formed part of Roman Hispania in the beginning of the 1st century BC. In AD 713, the city was taken by Muslim Berbers (Moors) from the Visigoths and in the 11th century it was conquered by King Alfonso VI of Castile. Following this, the walls, part of which still stands, are constructed to repel frequent Arab incursions that took place until the definitive conquest."
The city was later the center of the Duchy of Béjar ruled by the powerful House of Zúñiga.
"The name ""Béjar"" is of pre-Roman origin. The original form was ""Bigerra"" and is said to mean ""place of the beehives."" ""Béjar"" could be an adaption from the Spanish word ""abeja"", which means ""bee."" An older spelling of the city's name is ""Béxar"". In medieval documents, ""Vexar"" is found also."
Bexar County in the U.S. state of Texas acquired its name indirectly from this city.
Béjar has many remarkable monuments and historical buildings:
= = = Major Dundee = = =
"Major Dundee is a 1965 Western film directed by Sam Peckinpah and starring Charlton Heston, Richard Harris, Jim Hutton, and James Coburn. Written by Harry Julian Fink, the film is about a Union cavalry officer who leads a contentious troop of Army regulars, Confederate prisoners, and Indian scouts on an expedition into Mexico during the American Civil War in order to destroy a band of Apaches who have been raiding United States bases and settlements in the New Mexico territory. ""Major Dundee"" was filmed in various locations in Mexico. The movie was filmed in Eastman Color by Pathécolor, print by Technicolor."
"During the American Civil War, Union cavalry officer Major Amos Dundee (Charlton Heston) has been relieved of his command for an unspecified tactical error at the Battle of Gettysburg (it is implied that he showed too much initiative) and sent to head a prisoner-of-war camp in the New Mexico Territory. After a family of ranchers and a relief column of cavalry are massacred by an Apache war chief named Sierra Charriba (Michael Pate), Dundee, seizes the opportunity for glory, sends out his scout Samuel Potts (James Coburn) to locate Charriba and begins raising his own private army. He attempts to recruit Confederate prisoners led by his former friend turned rival from West Point, Captain Ben Tyreen (Richard Harris). Tyreen bears a grudge against Dundee and refuses his request. Before the war, Dundee cast the deciding vote in Tyreen's court-martial from the U.S. Army prior to the American Civil War for participating in a duel, leading to Tyreen's dismissal from the service and his later becoming an officer in the Confederate Army."
"Dundee begins building his army. Among them are Tim Ryan (Michael Anderson Jr.) who is the only survivor of the massacre, as well as a horse thief, a drunken mule-packer, a vengeful minister, and a small group of black soldiers who were formerly slaves. Dundee reluctantly appoints the inexperienced Lieutenant Graham (Jim Hutton) as his second in command. Eventually, Tyreen changes his mind and accepts Dundee's offer. He binds himself and his men to loyally serve Dundee, but only until Charriba is ""taken or destroyed."""
"When the diverse factions of Dundee's force are not fighting each other, they engage the Apaches in several bloody battles. Though they rescue several young children captured by the Apaches, the Americans lose most of their supplies in an ambush, forcing them to raid a village garrisoned by French troops supporting Emperor Maximilian of Mexico. However, there is little to loot, and Dundee ends up sharing some of his dwindling food with the starving Mexicans. Beautiful resident Teresa Santiago (Senta Berger), the Austrian widow of a doctor executed for his support of the rebels under Benito Juárez, causes further tensions between Dundee and Tyreen as they compete for her attention. Dundee makes it easy for his French prisoners to escape. When they return with reinforcements as he had expected, Dundee surprises them in a night attack and makes off with badly needed supplies. After the successful raid, the men of the command begin to get along. However, one of the Confederates, O.W. Hadley (Warren Oates) attempts to desert. Dundee is forced to order his execution, which again divides the men."
"Teresa and Dundee then have a brief affair. In an unguarded moment with her, he is attacked by the Apaches and wounded in the leg, forcing him to seek medical help in French-held Durango. The doctor successfully removes the arrow, but Dundee has to remain there to recuperate. He is tended by a pretty Mexican, whom he eventually takes to bed. When Teresa comes upon them unexpectedly, her relationship with Dundee comes to an abrupt end. Dundee starts drinking heavily as a result. Graham leads a small group of men to sneak into town to distract the French while Tyreen shames Dundee into resuming his mission."
"Charriba proves difficult to pin down, so Dundee pretends to give up and starts back for the United States. The Apaches give chase and end up in a trap. Charriba is killed by Ryan during the ambush. With their bargain concluded, Dundee and Tyreen prepare to resume their personal battle, but the vengeful French appear, forcing the two men to set aside their differences. With the French having positioned a portion of their force on the American side of the Rio Grande, blocking Dundee's forces from crossing into U.S. territory, the two cavalry forces charge each other at the Rio Grande, with major loss of life on both sides."
"Tyreen sees a French soldier seize the U.S. regimental colors, and seemingly moved by a patriotism he had thought dead, he takes back the captured American flag, and hands it over to Dundee – only to be shot in the stomach. With his last strength, he rides off to singlehandedly delay a second detachment of French cavalry while the others escape across the Rio Grande. Most of the men under Dundee's command have been killed, with only himself, Graham, Potts, Ryan, Sergeant Gomez, the Confederates Chillum and Benteen, and a few other soldiers escaping."
"As Dundee's force heads home, the narration notes that it's now April 19, 1865, and the soldiers are still unaware that the Civil War is over and President Lincoln has been assassinated."
"The screenplay, by Harry Julian Fink, Oscar Saul, and Peckinpah, was loosely based on historical precedents. However, contrary to claims by the production team at the time, it was not actually based on a true story. The film's novelization was written by Richard Wormser. During the Minnesota Dakota War of 1862, Union forces in that state were forced to recruit Confederate prisoners from Texas to make up for their meager numbers in fighting the Indians. Unlike the movie, where there is much animosity between the Union and Confederate troops in Dundee's command, the rebels, called ""Galvanized Yankees"", fought well and without much complaint. Both Union and Confederate forces also battled Apache, Navajo, and Comanche Indians throughout the war along the U.S.-Mexico border, making the scenario of the movie at least somewhat plausible. Before the film's production, Peckinpah had been working on a Custer project, based on the novel by Hoffman Birney ""The Dice of God"", but later abandoned it for this film. (His screenplay was filmed by Arnold Laven, as ""The Glory Guys"")."
"Critics of the film have also pointed out similarities between this and Herman Melville's classic novel ""Moby-Dick"". Many of the characters are similar to those from that book, with Dundee as Captain Ahab, Tyreen as Starbuck, Ryan as Ishmael, and other minor characters, with Sierra Charriba and his Apache tribe substituting for the whale, as is the general plot line (an obsessive idealist drives himself to destruction, disregarding the effects on others). These references to ""Moby-Dick"" were likely intentional on the part of the screenwriters. Some have also pointed out similarities of the plot to the Vietnam War, which are highly unlikely to have been intentional, as the war had not significantly escalated at the time of the film's production."
"The opening scene at the Rostes Ranch and the funeral after the first skirmish with the Indians were inspired by scenes from ""The Searchers"", while the scene in which Dundee's troop exits Fort Benlin, each faction of the command singing its own distinct song, is a deliberate parody of an equivalent scene in ""Fort Apache"". The characterization of Dundee, particularly his personality as a martinet and his relationship with Tyreen, has been related to John Wayne's character in Howard Hawks' ""Red River"". The Mexican Civil War setting recalls Robert Aldrich's ""Vera Cruz"". The film also includes several references to David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" – the execution of Hadley, and Dundee's drunken exile in Durango, closely mirror sequences from this film."
"The film ""seems a direct reaction to [John] Ford's ""Fort Apache"" ... with Charlton Heston cast as a more psychotic, more bluntly careerist version of Ford's Lt. Col. Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda),"" according to a NY ""Times"" review of the film at the time of the 2013 Blu-ray release. Reviewer Dave Kehr went on to write that Peckinpah ""plays Heston's square-jawed intransigence against the aristocratic refinement of a Southern officer (overplayed by ... Harris)"" and that Peckinpah ""would essentially reshape this material into ""The Wild Bunch"" four years later, wisely dividing Dundee's divided character into two separate figures"" played then by Robert Ryan and William Holden."
"Peckinpah found the script in late 1963. The early draft by Fink focused on Trooper Ryan and presented the film as a typical adventure story. Peckinpah largely discarded this, and working closely with acclaimed screenwriter, Oscar Saul (""A Streetcar Named Desire"") began making the movie into a complex character study about Dundee, making him a glory-hungry officer who would do anything to gain fame and recognition. He had the support of Heston, who had seen and enjoyed Peckinpah's previous film, ""Ride the High Country"", and was eager to work with the director. Actor R.G. Armstrong, who had a small part as a Reverend who tags along with the expedition, referred to the 156 minutes version of the film as """"Moby-Dick"" on horseback""."
"The production of the movie was very troubled. Peckinpah was often drunk on the set, and was supposedly so abusive towards the cast that Heston had to threaten him with a cavalry saber in order to calm him down: he even charged Peckinpah on horseback at one point, leading the director to panic and order the camera crane he was working on to be raised fast. Peckinpah also fired a large number of crew members for very trivial reasons throughout the shoot. Columbia studio executives feared that the project was out of control, and that Peckinpah was too unstable to finish the picture, so they cut the shooting schedule of the film by several weeks. Heston gave up his entire salary for the film in order to keep Peckinpah on the project – a gesture rarely equaled in Hollywood history. The studio, however, forced Peckinpah to wrap up shooting very abruptly. Heston alleged that Peckinpah, towards the end of the shoot, simply became drunk and wandered off the set, and that he (Heston) had to finish directing many portions of the movie himself."
"The length of Peckinpah's original cut has been disputed. According to some sources, including the 2005 DVD commentary, the original cut was 4 hours 38 minutes long, which was initially edited down to 156 minutes. Included in the unseen longer cuts were several slow-motion battle scenes inspired by Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"". The movie was also fairly gory for the standards of 1965, and more bloody and violent scenes were cut out. A bombastic musical score by Daniele Amfitheatrof was added to the film despite Peckinpah's protests, as was the title song, ""The Major Dundee March"", sung by Mitch Miller and his Sing-Along Gang. One of the most bizarre parts of the score was the use of an electronically altered sound – three anvils of different lengths played-back at half-speed every time Charriba or the Apaches would be seen or even mentioned. ""Until the Apache is taken or destroyed"" was one of the film's catch phrases."
"At the film's initial release, it was 136 minutes long. After a disastrous premiere – the movie was almost universally panned by critics – an additional thirteen minutes were cut out, despite the protests of Peckinpah and producer Jerry Bresler. Some feel that these cuts ruined the movie's scope and created significant plot holes, though others argue that these plot holes exist even in the extended version."
"""Major Dundee"" helped cement Peckinpah's image as a renegade filmmaker, which he would enhance with the conflicts on his later films, such as ""Straw Dogs"", ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"", and ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"". Others, namely Peckinpah's biographer David Weddle (author of ""If They Move ... Kill 'Em! The Life and Times of Sam Peckinpah""), argue that Peckinpah is just as much to blame for the final product as Columbia and Jerry Bresler. Since its release on DVD, ""Dundee"" has begun to get recognition and notice from the public at large, and not just Western fans."
"The nascent German association permitted teams from outside the country in their new championship, as long as they were members of one of its regional associations. This is how Prague, a team from Austria-Hungary, managed an appearance in the German national final. Once the DFB joined FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) in 1904, clubs from outside the country were no longer permitted to play in Germany."
"From 1903 to 1944, teams played for the ""Viktoria"" (Victoria Championship Trophy). In 1908, a cup competition named ""Kronprinzenpokal"" for the regional representative XIs was started, the trophy having been donated by Crown Prince Wilhelm of Prussia. The Viktoria was originally intended to be awarded, on an annual alternating basis, to the championship teams of the DFB and the nation's rugby union teams; however, football became the more dominant sport, the Rugby clubs left the federation and the trophy stayed with the DFB. Championship play skipped a year in 1904, was interrupted by World War I between 1914 and 1918, and again at the end of World War II between 1944 and 1946."
"The last team to win the Viktoria was Dresdner SC, who beat the air-force club Luftwaffen SV Hamburg in Berlin's Olympiastadion 4–0 to end the 1943–44 competition. In the confusion at the end of World War II, the trophy disappeared. It was re-discovered decades later in an East German bank safe-deposit box where it had been placed by a Dresden supporter for safekeeping. It has since been returned to the DFB. In the meantime, a new championship trophy, the ""Meisterschale"" (""Championship Plate""), sometimes nicknamed ""die Salatschüssel"" (the salad bowl), was created in 1949."
"In 1919, there were 150,000 registered football players in Germany; by 1932, there were more than a million. In spite of the formation of a national association, German football held to an ideal of amateurism built around regional and local sports associations who felt that professionalism would diminish sportsmanship and local participation in the game. In the early 1930s, the DFB's president, Felix Linnemann, pushed for the creation of a professional league, or ""Reichsliga"", in which the country's best teams would compete for the national championship. The idea was rebuffed by the regional federations dominating the sport."

"³ the Kreisliga is not established in all areas of the country, e.g. in Mittelrhein."
"The reach of Germany's totalitarian Nazi regime stretched into social institutions at all levels, including their football leagues. Most sports and football associations were disbanded or replaced by Nazi-sponsored organisations. To join a DFB club, a player required recommendations from two non-Marxists to be permitted to play. The DFB gradually lost its independence as it was assimilated into the Deutscher Reichsausschuss für Leibesübungen (DRA) (Reich Committee for Physical Education)."
"Under Hans von Tschammer und Osten as Reichssportsführer, appointed by the Nazis, formerly independent sports organisations became departments of a new organisation which replaced the DRA — Deutscher Reichsbund für Leibesübungen (DRL, later NSRL or Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen). As in most of German society at the time, sports associations and football teams took part in the purge of Jews from their organisations as ordered by the regime. A few clubs, such as Alemannia Aachen and Bayern Munich, moved to support or protect their members in the face of these actions."
"Football was re-organised into sixteen Gaue (DRL sub-divisions) in the Gauliga, which was in place from 1933 to 1945. The overall effect of this was positive for German football. Prior to 1933, nearly 600 clubs competed in the top flight. League re-organisation reduced this to about 170 sides and significantly raised the level of competition. This was the beginning of a process of consolidation of the myriad of small regional leagues that would culminate in a stronger, unified national league structure. The German Cup was introduced in 1935. Known initially as the Tschammerpokal, after Hans von Tschammer, the first cup winner was 1. FC Nürnberg. Play for the Tschammerpokal went on until 1943 and was not resumed again until 1953, under its new name."
"The pre-war period saw a number of German sides from Saarland, Danzig and the Memel Region playing in German league and cup competitions even though the Versailles Treaty had handed those regions over to the League of Nations after the end of World War I; football-wise, they had remained within the DFB (or DRL, respectively). In post-war times, 1. FC Saarbrücken (formerly FV Saarbrücken) played in the French Second Division for one season. They won that division handily but were denied promotion to the First Division. The Saarland was to be granted its own FIFA membership until it was re-united with Germany in 1956."
"Twenty years back, FC Schalke 04 dominated German football during the Nazi era and was often held up for propaganda purposes as an example of the new Germany. As the Reich expanded through conquest, teams from Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Alsace-Lorraine and Luxembourg were incorporated into the Gauliga. After the Anschluss, the forced union of Austria with Germany, Vienna's Rapid Wien captured the Tschammerpokal in 1938 and the German national championship in 1941, the latter with a 4–3 win over Schalke, who had been three goals ahead with just fifteen minutes to play in the game."
"During the war, football was used as a morale booster for the population and was supported by the regime. Many teams were sponsored by the Luftwaffe, the SS, or other branches of the military. As the tide turned against Germany, the Gauliga began to crumble as players were called away to military service or were killed in the conflict, stadiums were bombed and travel became difficult. The original sixteen Gauligen broke up into over thirty smaller, more local circuits. The level of play deteriorated and lopsided scores became common, the record being a 32–0 win by Germania Mudersbach over FV Engen. The 1943–44 championship was initially cancelled but eventually went ahead after widespread protest. The 1944–45 season began less than two weeks later, rather than after the usual three-month summer break. The last recorded match in the Third Reich was on 23 April 1945 as Bayern Munich defeated 1860 Munich 3–2. Less than three weeks later, Germany surrendered unconditionally."
"Under Allied occupation all organizations, including sports clubs and associations, were initially banned. However, within a year, sports-only organizations without political affiliation were permitted, and in the American, British and French occupation zones, most pre-war clubs were reconstituted. Oberliga play resumed in 1945–46 on a regional basis in the South and South-West; Berlin and the other regions followed and, in 1948, 1. FC Nürnberg defeated 1. FC Kaiserslautern 2–1 to become the first post-war national champions. At the time, there was no ""prize"" to play for. The Viktoria trophy traditionally awarded to the nation's best side had gone missing in the chaos of post-war Germany. In 1949, Nürnberg and each winning side since VfB Leipzig in 1903, would have their names engraved on the newly created Meisterschale, nicknamed ""the salad bowl"" for its shape. The German Cup competition introduced prior to the war also returned, with Rot-Weiss Essen's 2–1 victory over Alemannia Aachen in 1953."
"Through the 1950s, there were continued calls for the formation of a central professional league, especially as professional leagues in other countries began to draw Germany's best players away from the amateur domestic leagues. At the international level the German game began to falter as German teams often fared poorly against professional teams from other countries. A key supporter of the central league concept was national team head coach Sepp Herberger who said, ""If we want to remain competitive internationally, we have to raise our expectations at the national level."""
"In spite of this, Germany (as West Germany) managed to win its first World Cup in 1954 defeating heavily favoured Hungary 3–2, the only ""amateur"" (i.e. semi-professional) side ever to do so. The unexpected victory was called ""The Miracle of Bern"" by a delighted nation. An oddity of the 1954 World Cup preliminary rounds was the fielding of a separate side by the German state of Saarland, which was occupied by the French and did not become a part of West Germany again until after a plebiscite and treaty negotiation. The Saarlanders acquitted themselves well, finishing second in their group ahead of Norway and behind group winner West Germany."
"Meanwhile, in East Germany, a separate league was established with the formation of the DS-Oberliga (Deutscher Sportausschuß Oberliga or German Sports Association) in 1949. The league was renamed the Fußball Oberliga DFV in 1958 and was generally referred to simply as the DDR-Liga or DDR-Oberliga. The league fielded 14 teams with 2 relegation spots."
"The defeat of the national team by Yugoslavia (0–1) in a 1962 World Cup quarter final game in Chile was one impetus (of many) to the formation of a national league. Under new DFB president Hermann Gösmann (elected that very day) the Bundesliga was created in Dortmund at the Westfalenhallen on 28 July 1962 to begin play starting with the 1963–64 season. The new German professional league was modelled on the long-established English league, which had been set up in 1888."
"At the time, there were five Oberligen, or Premier leagues, in place representing West Germany's North, South, West, Southwest, and Berlin. East Germany, under Soviet occupation, maintained its separate league structure. Forty-six clubs applied for admission to the new league. Sixteen teams were selected based on their success on the field, economic criteria and representation of the various Oberligen."
The first Bundesliga games were played on 24 August 1963. Early favorite 1. FC Köln (45:19) was the first Bundesliga champion over second place clubs Meidericher SV and Eintracht Frankfurt (both 39:25).
"The new league was met with enthusiasm early on and large crowds came out to watch the nation's top teams. No single team was able to dominate through the 1960s — in seven seasons from 1963–64 through to 1969–70, seven different teams won the championship. The 1965–66 season saw the promotion of Bayern Munich to the top league and in 1968–69 they won their first championship on their way to becoming the most dominant side in Bundesliga history."
"The 1960s also saw one of the strangest incidents in the history of the Bundesliga. The licence of Hertha BSC Berlin was revoked for the 1964–65 season and the team relegated to the Regionalliga Berlin (Regional leagues being the leagues below the Bundesliga at the time) for breaking the league's player salary rules, partially in an attempt to entice players to Berlin at the time of the construction of the Berlin Wall and high Cold War tensions. The last place clubs, Karlsruher SC and FC Schalke 04, tried to avoid being demoted by laying claim to Hertha's place. It was decided to suspend relegation for one season and increase the number of teams in the league from 16 to 18 to accommodate the two teams which would normally be promoted from the Regionalligen. The politics of the Cold War era led to a space being held open for a Berlin side to replace Hertha in a show of solidarity with the former capital city. What followed was the debacle of the promotion of Tasmania 1900 Berlin, which went on to the worst season in league history."
"West Germany made another appearance in the final of the World Cup in 1966, losing (4–2) to England in extra time that included a famously controversial goal."
"The young league got off to a difficult start in the decade as a scandal broke with Kickers Offenbach president Horst-Gregorio Canellas putting forward evidence of players being bribed to affect the outcome of games. Allegations were that a number of clubs, including Bielefeld, Hertha, Schalke, and Köln, were involved. The scandal caused a disastrous loss of confidence in the Bundesliga and game attendance plummeted. Investigations by the DFB led to the banning of many players, although most of these sentences were commuted. Arminia Bielefeld, identified as the club central to the scandal, was stripped of all points they had earned during the 1971–72 season and then relegated to the league below."
"Enthusiasm for the sport was restored by host West Germany's win in the 1974 World Cup and the first wins by Bundesliga sides in the European Champions Cup (a triple by Bayern Munich in 1974, 1975 and 1976) and the UEFA Cup (Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1975). Attendance rose steadily after the end of the bribery scandal, putting some teams on solid enough financial footings to be able to attract the first foreign stars to the league in the 1977–78 season."
"The Bundesliga was dominated by two sides through the 1970s. Borussia Mönchengladbach became the first team to successfully defend its title with its win in 1970–71. Bayern Munich became the first three-time champion with wins in 1971–72, 1972–73 and 1973–74. Borussia Mönchengladbach then turned a triple of its own over the following three seasons. After wins by Köln and Hamburg, Bayern closed out the decade by matching Mönchengladbach's five titles."
"The 1980s were a rather bleak decade for the Bundesliga. There was a general decline in attendance throughout the league: in the 1977–78 season average attendance for a Bundesliga match was over 26,000 — the best since 1964–65. By 1985–86 that figure bottomed out at just 17,600 spectators per game. The country's football was also affected by the general European problem of hooliganism and the appearance of neo-Nazi fan groups. The German domestic game became a graceless, rough-edged, brute physical contest devoid of the kinds of star players fans had enjoyed watching in earlier decades. The best German players were regularly lured south to play in Serie A by cash-rich Italian clubs. Bayern Munich's domination of the Bundesliga became numbingly repetitive as they took six of ten titles in the 1980s."
But by the end of the decade the stage was set for some fundamental changes to the Bundesliga. The league signed its first rich television contract and German re-unification and the subsequent merger of the football leagues of East and West Germany was on the horizon.
"In 1991, a year after German reunification, East Germany's Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR, or Football Federation of the German Democratic Republic, was merged into West Germany's DFB. East German sides were seeded and assigned to various levels within the West German league structure, which was itself modified to accommodate the influx of new clubs. To facilitate the union with the eastern league the Bundesliga temporarily expanded to 20 clubs in the 1991–92 season and added the DDR-Oberliga's top two sides, Dynamo Dresden and Hansa Rostock. The Bundesliga returned to an 18 team slate in the following season with Dresden managing to stick in the top league, while ""Rostock"" was relegated. These two teams continued to make appearances in the Bundesliga through the 1990s. The only other former East German sides to earn promotion to the Bundesliga to date are FC Energie Cottbus and VfB Leipzig, while a half dozen others of these clubs have played in 2. Bundesliga."
"Beginning with the 1995–96 season, the league adopted a new scoring system. Teams were now awarded three points for a win rather than two as had been traditional, with a view toward encouraging more effort through a greater reward in the standings."
"Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Bundesliga again enjoyed increasing popularity in Germany. This was on one hand due to the success of the German national football team (third World Cup title in 1990 and third European Championships title in 1996). The Bundesliga also began to take a more deliberate approach to marketing and promoting itself and its member clubs, following the example of other more widely recognized European leagues."
"In 1998, 1. FC Kaiserslautern became the first (and so far, only) team in Bundesliga and German history to win the league championship as a newly promoted team, having won the 2. Bundesliga title the previous year."
"Secondary design factors included engine and propeller rating factors, minimum internal accommodation levels, safety regulations, and a limit on the number of sails carried on board. Later on, crew limits were introduced, and limits on the use of exotic materials, such as carbon fibre and Nomex, and also scantlings for hull structural design developed by the American Bureau of Shipping."
"In a handicap race, the IOR length was used to compute a ""time allowance"". In Europe this was calculated on the duration of the race, in seconds per hour, known as Time on Time, whereas in the USA they preferred to base it on the length of the race, as seconds per mile, known as Time on Distance. Time on Distance is easier to calculate at any point in the race, but can cause significant anomalies in tidal waters as the distance sailed through the water can differ significantly from the distance over the ground, due to the effect of the tide."
"The IOR rule was also used to define ""level rating classes,"" where each class had a maximum IOR rating, and the first boat to finish was the winner, with no handicapping. The first of these was the One Ton class, so named because there was a spare trophy from the defunct One Ton rating class, and this then spawned the Mini Ton, 1/4 Ton, 1/2 Ton, 3/4 Ton and Two Ton classes, as well as unofficial 50-footer, ULDB 70, and Maxi classes. The official classes each had an annual world championships."
"The IOR was run by the ITC, or International Technical Committee, of the Offshore Racing Congress, chaired between 1979 and 1987 by the late Gary Mull of San Francisco. As with all published handicapping formulae, there was an ongoing game between the designers finding ways of designing boats that took advantage of shortcomings in the measurement system and handicapping formulae, and the rule makers closing the loopholes to ensure fair racing and a reasonable competitive life for the boats. As the racing became more competitive, the rate of change in the rule accelerated, and also the boats at the top of the fleet became stripped out racing machines that performed well but were expensive and also difficult to sail, and this resulted in a loss of popularity. However even if club sailors could not compete against the top boats, the IOR did generate a reasonably level playing field across the sailing spectrum, with club sailors buying production race boats or custom boats past their prime, and moving up to more competitive boats as they wanted to sail up the fleet. Towards the end of its life the IOR had become a stable rule, but by then it had a reputation of changing too often, and this sowed the seeds for its successors. IMS was introduced as a more ""scientific"" rule for racing yachts, driven by the USA, whereas Channel Handicap was introduced in 1983 by the RORC as a simple club level rule that would hopefully feed people into IOR racing - though in fact it proved to be the final nail in the coffin for the IOR rule."
"Boats had a short competitive life for two reasons: the overall increase in performance of newer boats due to better design and construction, and also the effect of changes in the handicapping rules. The first was catered for by an ""age allowance"", which reduced the handicap of boats as they got older. The second was catered for to some extent by grandfather clauses in the IOR rules, but this did not cater for designer's ability to design to the rule increasing with every year. This, plus the annual rule changes, gave boats a competitive life of no more than 2 or 3 years at the top level."
"Initially designs were heavy displacement, with a fine, often V shaped stern as well as a fine bow. These were powerful boats for sailing to windward, but had limited performance offwind as well as often having an alarming tendency to broach - designers included Sparkman & Stephens and Dick Carter. Then Ron Holland's quarter-tonner ""Eygthene"" began the next phase of increasingly lightweight boats with fuller sterns giving more of a wedge shape, and a change from masthead rig to a fractional rig. This dinghy influence gave much faster performance reaching and downwind, and although windward performance was not as good, it improved as the designs developed. The ultimate in this stage was the various lightweight centerboard designs with internal ballast, but these were not sufficiently seaworthy for offshore racing and so were penalised so heavily that they were effectively banned. Designs then moved to a more moderate displacement, and as race courses moved from offshore racing with plenty of reaching towards windward/leeward round the cans, racing designs became narrower and less powerful but more easily driven."
"A good reference on the IOR Rule, including an analysis of the different formulae and measurements used, can be found in the book ""The Offshore Yacht""."
"Today, modern Maxis or ""Super-Maxi's"" are simply limited to 30m (98'); encouraging improvements in boat design, and exciting sailing; not simply rule modification, as still plagues the America's Cup competition."
"The introduction of VPPs, or Velocity Prediction Programs, morphed the science of yacht performance measurement. Inherent to the IOR was the concept of a measurement officer taking discrete hull measurements and the IOR formula assumed the hull lines behaved continuously between measurement points. The IMS took the actual hull lines and analysed their continuum, essentially eliminating funny bumps or hollows in the ensuing yachts and generally rendering much cleaner, faster lines that were far more exciting, safer to sail, and had higher resale value."
= = = Indiana State Road 1 = = =
"State Road 1 (SR 1) is a north–south state highway in eastern Indiana, consisting of two segments. Its southern segment begins at U.S. Highway 50 and Interstate 275 in east-central Dearborn County, just east of Lawrenceburg, and ends at Interstate 469 south of Fort Wayne. Its northern segment begins at Interstate 69 on Fort Wayne's north side, and ends at U.S. Route 20 in east-central Steuben County, approximately east of Angola."
"State Road 1 begins at an interchange of Interstate 275; this is I-275's only exit in Indiana. Just after the interchange there is a stop light at U.S. Route 50 (US 50). SR 1 travels north-northwest until it reaches I-74; just beyond I-74 it crosses Indiana State Road 46 (SR 46). SR 1 continues north until it meets U.S. Route 52 (US 52) just west of Cedar Grove. Then US 52 and SR 1 continue north-northeast for until they reach Brookville; here, US 52 turns west on its way to Indianapolis, while SR 1 continues north-northwest for where it meets Indiana State Road 44 (SR 44). SR 1 and SR 44 travel together for where SR 1 turns north-northeast towards downtown Connersville. North of Connersville, SR 1 travels north-northwest until it reaches Cambridge City, where SR 1 crosses U.S. Route 40 (US 40). After the intersection at US 40, SR 1 heads north-northeast. After SR 1 has an interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70), then heads due north towards U.S. Route 36 (US 36). SR 1 turns east onto US 36 for , then leaves US 36 and travels generally due north until it reaches Fort Wayne. Just south of Fort Wayne, SR 1 ends at an interchange with Interstate 469 (I-469)."
"On the north side of Fort Wayne at the Dupont Road interchange of Interstate 69 (I-69), the northern section of SR 1 begins and heads east. The road heads away from I–69 as a six-lane divided highway, along the south edge of the Parkview Regional Medical Center complex, passing through numerous commercial properties. The highway narrows to a four-lane divided highway at Diebold Road and then enters an area of mixed commercial and residential properties. At Tonkel Road, SR 1 begins to curve northeast toward Leo and narrows to a two-lane highway. The route then leaves Fort Wayne, passing through rural farm land with scattered houses. Curving due north to enter Leo on Main Street, SR 1 then passes through residential areas of that town. North of downtown Leo the highway curves northeast and passes through a mix of commercial and residential properties. As the road enters DeKalb County it curves to run due north. The highway then enters Spencerville, passing through the center of town. After Spencerville, the road curves northeast, before again turning back north. The highway enters St. Joe and takes a sharp curve to head due east. The route crosses CSX Railroad tracks and makes another sharp curve heading due north. The road continues north until it meets SR 8. The two routes head east-southeast for a concurrency, until SR 1 departs the joint section heading due north. The road then passes through rural farmland, with a few houses, as a two-lane highway. Upon entering Butler it crosses the Norfolk Southern Railroad tracks, before encountering a signalized intersection with US 6 in downtown Butler. SR 1 then leaves Butler heading due north until it intersects DeKalb County Road 46, at which point the highway turns northwest. The route enter Hamilton and begins a concurrency with SR 427, heading northeast and passing Hamilton Lake. After , SR 1 leaves the concurrency heading due north. The highway then continues in that direction until reaching its northern terminus at US 20."
SR 1 began at US 50 and Main Street in Lawrenceburg and traveled north on Main Street until Main Street became Ridge Avenue. It then followed Ridge Avenue until it met the current SR 1.
"Between the late 1940s and late 1950s, SR 1 had three or more lanes. This started in Bluffton and continued north to Fort Wayne."
"Before being split into two sections on either side of Fort Wayne, SR 1 traveled on a continuous route through that city. From the present northern terminus of its southern section at Interstate 469's exit 6 in south-central Allen County, it continued north on Bluffton Road to pass just east of Fort Wayne's main airport (then known as Baer Field). In the Waynedale district of southwestern Fort Wayne, SR 3 joined Bluffton Road from the southwest at Lower Huntington Road. From there the routes originally continued together northward, hugging the bank of the St. Mary's River before curving east to bridge it. SR 1/SR 3 then immediately turned right (south) onto Broadway for about before turning east on Rudisill Boulevard. From there the routes continued to a one way pair of Clinton Street (southbound) and Lafayette Street (northbound), which then carried a concurrency of US 27 from Decatur and US 33 from St. Marys, Ohio. At Lima Road, SR 3 continues north, as US 27 and SR 1 got on I-69 northbound until exiting at Dupont Road."
"In later years, after the decommissioning of SR 3 through Fort Wayne and the completion of the Baer Field Thruway (later renamed Airport Expressway), SR 1 was rerouted to turn right onto that roadway, which deposited motorists onto Paulding Road at Fairfield Avenue. From there SR 1 headed east along Paulding Road to its intersection with US 27/US 33 (now Lafayette Street), where it turned left (north) and joined those routes to downtown Fort Wayne."
"North of Rudisill Boulevard, the original concurrency of US 27/US 33/SR 1/SR 3 (as well as the later concurrency of the first 3 routes) followed the Lafayette Street/Clinton Street pair to downtown Fort Wayne, where US 33 departed to the west. North of downtown, Lafayette Street became Spy Run Boulevard (still one-way northbound) until it terminated at the north end of the one-way pair with Clinton Street. From there the three (later two) combined routes continued north for a few blocks on Clinton Street to Northrup Street, where they curved northwest onto the latter roadway. Just south of Coliseum Boulevard SR 930 (then U.S. 30), Northrup Street becomes Lima Road, and continues north-northwest to I-69."
"At that point, SR 3 continued (later resumed) northbound on Lima Road to Kendallville, and US 27 and SR 1 both entered I-69 northbound, with SR 1 concurrent with the freeway until the Dupont Road interchange and US 27 concurrent with I-69 into Michigan."
"At one point, the northern terminus was at SR 120 just west of the Ohio State Line."
= = = Territorial Support Group = = =
"The Territorial Support Group (TSG) is a Met Operations unit of London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). In 2012 it consisted of 793 officers and 29 support staff. It specialises in public order containment, among other specialist policing. The TSG is a uniformed unit of the MPS that replaced the similarly controversial Special Patrol Group in 1987. TSG units patrol the streets of London in marked police vans or ""carriers""; using the call sign ""Uniform"". Generally each carrier has an advanced (police) driver, five constables and a sergeant. Territorial Support Groups often comprise three carriers, eighteen constables, and three sergeants reporting to an Inspector. They separately patrol designated patches. When deployed, it is by the MPS Information Room. Due to the public order nature of their role often numerous carriers will be assigned, a common situation being drunken rowdiness at public house closing time. TSG officers can be identified as TSG from the distinctive ""U"" in their shoulder numbers."
Today the TSG has three main tasks in the policing of the Metropolitan Police District:
"Although public order is not the TSG's only role, it is certainly their most visible and well-known. Like most Police Support Unit vehicles, TSG vans are equipped with mesh window shields and officers are equipped with acrylic glass riot shields, visored 'NATO' helmets, shin and elbow guards, along with fireproof coveralls when required. This level of protection allows them to deal with many violent situations, including riots, football violence and suspects armed with a variety of weapons. TSG officers are trained to a higher standard of operational readiness in their public order role than most other Police Support Units outside London; TSG training is refreshed every five weeks as a matter of routine. Exercises are conducted predominantly at the MPS Specialist Training Centre in Gravesend, Kent, though other sites are used as required, and encompass all public order scenarios; officers will undergo extensive riot training including being petrol bombed in large-scale engagements, prison clearance tactics, football stadium scenarios, night club scenarios, aircraft, rail and various 'angry-man' scenarios, as well as additional specialist training. TSG units spend considerable time training with other specialist police teams as well as certain military units. Also, if a siege situation is present, but firearms are not involved, TSG will often be deployed to counter the threat. Reflecting this role the unit's former head, Commander Michael Johnson, was tactical commander for the London 2012 Olympics."
"TSG provides support to regular divisional officers through high-visibility patrols, surveillance and decoy operations while also providing a presence on the streets. Boroughs are also supported through the provision of a 'Commissioner's Reserve' a section of TSG that is on standby all year round; it is designed so such units are always available for rapid response of a sizeable number of officers anywhere within the Metropolis to quell public order problems, from a bar brawl to large-scale public disorder. Day to day TSG assist the boroughs in handling and relocating particularly violent prisoners."
"TSG is equipped and trained to deal with the aftermath or evacuation during or after a terrorism emergency in London, and the unit includes a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear) trained team. Working closely with SO15 (the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command) TSG also has counter-terrorism responsibilities."
"Potential TSG candidates are selected from mainstream divisional officers. Officers are selected on merit and much emphasis is placed upon their personal policing ability, motivation, resilience and good communication skills. Fitness and stamina are also seen as essential attributes of TSG personnel. Applicants must be recommended by a senior officer (minimum rank of Inspector) whilst on division."
"Mercedes Sprinters are the standard vehicle of TSG and each van transports six Constables and a Sergeant. Three of these vans can form an operational Serial ready to respond to incidents; following the national PSU model this would include an Inspector, three Sergeants, eighteen Constables, two medics and three drivers."
