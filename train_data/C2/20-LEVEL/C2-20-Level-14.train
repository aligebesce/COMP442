Over  my uncle er  old Harry   he had a house around Clarendon Road  er  oh I dunno!
There wasn't many houses there at that time.
Mm mm.
We built our house there.
Mm?
Erm  it was meant to be the oldest house in erm  Broadstone
Ah?
"and we built our hou , not, bought the plot of land and built our own house on it."
"Well  old Harry  shared with my uncle  he had his house and he bought a piece of land on the bottom of his garden  and he built wall on  his  or this piece along the bottom of his garden, but er  I couldn't tell you, it wasn't very far up the road."
But er  yeah I know.
But I haven't been up to cla Clarendon Road for some time now.
Er  ha!
"There used to be a  a house on the end of the common up at Clarendon Road, the opposite side  oh!"
"Er  old Mrs   I dunno, but th , anyway there was  only this one old house up in the common and er  I went up there one time with  horse and   take a couple of pigs from there down to Wimborne market."
But I suppose the old house has pulled down under pressure and built on now but  that was the only house going up through there in them days.
That was a very old house!
Wimborne market's supposed to be old.
Mm?
Wimborne market must be very old!
"Oh Lord, yes!"

Well yeah!
a di difference of their point stipulation
"Oh, yeah."
"and er  their gra , grade stipulation so  even if you got  three A's they can still refuse you."
"He said that  he said it doesn't happen in York, but it has happened in some places  you know."
"I could understand them refusing you if they'd asked for  say, a B in english and C in something else"
Yes.
"and you got D in English and D in so , although it may not be the point, or C."
Yes.
"Because  then you  you wouldn't  certainly up, be up to the standard would you?"
In that particular
No.
Mm.
er  particular thing.
"But I suppose  espec , like if you got really really good grades  you'd be  different to the group."
"You know, say if they wanted to get you three C's and you got three A's  shut up Sam!"
You could be lot  a lot different to the group.
The higher standard?
Yeah.
Mm.
Which might make it more difficult to teach.
"Yeah, I suppose it would."
True!
Would it make an effect?
Mm.
"You shouldn't take that word, well"
What you unkind?
No
I do
No Lary.

And  oh   I don't really know.
That doesn't show anything!
"Yet the January, February, March the temperature is  high  which is temperature  I can't tell by looking at that, which one's temperature and which one's rainfall."
That's temperature and that's rainfall.
"Yeah but which line refers to which, how can I tell?"
You need to put the dotted line there  and square there
No you can look like that.
How?
"Rain, ten millimetres of rain equals one millimetre  ten of rain equals one millimetre and this one  one degrees  celsius  equals"
Well I'm sorry  I don't think that is very clever  for you!
there and
"one degrees, how can temperature"
What?
one degree celsius equals one millimetre
Yes.
So it's twenty five degrees celsius in January?
No.
Well I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to put some sort of  clue on it.

Next Friday.
"Next Friday, oh right."
And is that the microphone?
Yes.

Yeah.
And even if it  and are you supposed to tell people that you're recording what they're saying or just record it
Erm
and then tell them afterwards?
"I suppose you should tell them that you're going to tape the conversation maybe, yeah."
Yes.
I don't suppose that matters really.
"But I mean, if you erm  if you put your headphones on you see, they might just think erm  you're listening to a Walkman."
And er  they would come up with some bad language towards you.
Then especially if you told them you were recording what they  said .
Could be dangerous.
"I've asked Brian to take the dog out as well, when he comes back."
I won't have time now.

He must have heard that I'd come back from  Ireland.
"So, he was talking about Ireland, really raving about it and  his name's Kennedy and  he's from Liverpool and he likes to think he's got Irish blood in him, he's been there twice this year and"
Mhm.

So we were chatting away about that.
"And then erm  after the rehearsal  some of us went off to get a pizza  before the concert  and he said to me, erm  are you interested in going to hear the  Mozart Requiem, it's on at the Barbican on Wednesday?"
"So I said, yeah!"
"Co , I've always wanted to hear it, and as you know it's our next concert."
"So erm  that was fine, until  after the concert"

Well have you decided  you're not gonna do anything about it?
I think it's just a matter of  losing the
Yeah.
No I might er  might decide to do something about it if I get the inspiration.
I'm just getting  now because erm  erm  I've been for an aud not an audition .
Wrong word.
I've been for an interview with Mencap.
Oh aye?
"And erm  I didn't get the actual job I went for but they put me on the, on the relief register so that I go round to different people's homes or different big hospitals  and different Mencap homes  relieving people when they're on holiday or  if they're short of staff or something like that."
So
Yeah.
"erm  so er  I'm waiting to hear, so that I'm getting irritable at the minute cos  A the money is going and B  being out of work, being here all day."
It's sending me crackers.
I'm used to working day and night.
I mean it's very hard to do neither.
husband  he wants some beans.
Who does?
Him.
Yeah you do!
There are!
Didn't know anything about it!
You do!
They tell you that!
The whole thing is just
There are no rules.
This is  this .
"See, ours was nineteen ninety one because it"
You're joking!
was er  absolutely
"Three years, or two years, I dunno!"
Ah well cos I think the newer one will be  this is some government thing to do with the gas.
I mean with fitting the
Yeah.
flue.
So we had all that consequently!
Mm.
And erm
Hey!
"some of them of failed, and if they fail you have to pay so much."
You have to pay so much anyway to have it changed.
"But, as I say, we've been very unhappy about it!"
We had erm  notes through about  Out of
"ten pillows, seven needed replacing and we needed a new milk saucepan, a new frying pan, a new ashtray"
Mm!
cleaners etcetera!
"So, I replaced most of them myself and then whenever we came down  course we complained about the cleaning!"
When we came down  well  it was still  less that desirable!
It's terrible!
And erm
The cooker was filthy!
"Erm, two girls."
Mhm.
What sort of things do you do to help the homeless?
"Well basically  erm, I go around  in some of the streets and try and  help people, families who have missed  they've lost their chi , erm lost people  and try and reunite them."
"What if they don't want to be reunited, can't that cause problems?"
Yes it can.
"I find some people on the streets are quite like, pigheaded and they don't really want to go back  for some reason really."
Mm.
But maybe they've got problems that they can't go back for?
"Yeah, they have got problems and that's why erm, people like us come along and try and help them."
Have any of
Wha
"the homeless people actually ever been taken into care, like foster and  ah, adoption?"
"Erm, yes  quite a few times actually."
Especially when abuse is inc be erm
Abuse.
Abuse.
where people have been
Aha.

Sometimes that is the case.
Unfortunately.

With root ginger or powdered ginger.
It's root ginger.
It's delicious!
Very strong.
Cos it's very subtle.
But it's in a
Oh I
packet is it?
It's actually very subtle.
Mhm.
It's delicious.
"So many people  when they eat it, they can't actually  decipher what it has, you know what it is, that it is ginger."
Yes.
It's very subtle.
I think Margaret doesn't understand the word subtle.
Cos she takes about two pounds of root ginger  peels it
Really?
and chops it
and puts it with a pound of  Philadelphia cheese into the cavity of the chicken  outside  it's just lightly rubbed with oil
Mm mm.
and then about two ounces of powdered ginger  sprinkled over it.
"Well when  and he wasn't on  he wasn't on, but he he at the  towards the end  they gave the three of them  thirty seconds to describe the go , you know, the qualities of  of the"
Of a good leader.
of of of er  their leader
Mm.
"and  the one  one for the Libs  he only used twenty seconds, twenty two seconds!"
And he finished?
"And, you know  he said  I'm sure Paddy Ashdown would think that you could of found something else  to use the other"
To say.
eight seconds up !
"But er  but  he ended up, you know  as sure as they've asked er the"
something to say
"the show of hands, like he was er  he was the one that the floating voters were"
Yeah.
But
I mean
But only
"He, he looks a very persuasive kind of character doesn't he erm  I mean he's, he's quite sort of erm  well a nice person  well he"
Yeah.
seems to be!
But er
But  you know
"Well see  wha wha down  there was a couple there in their leather jackets  look, looked a cli couple  you know, the boy and girl  couple of yobbos!"
Looked a right couple of yobbos And  er  well what day is it like?
Well he says er  how could you vote for Kinnock he says  because the press attacks him and he doesn't defend himself!
But your dukes up Neil!
You know!
"Yeah, well"
And this is the mentality of them!
Childish!
"I mean  ha  when it comes down to it, at the end of the day  today  we we live in  er a media orientated world don't we?"
We turn on the box
Well
And not bother about .
"I mean charity shops erm  library, hairdressers, surgeries  Boardman as I know"
I think that's a very sensible idea actually rather than er trying to do the whole town.
Because that was er you know  I mean it got the group together
Yeah
I thought because everybody had the same experience.
I liked the experience because I had never done it.
Mm.
what a waste of time.
The number of people I've talked to that  I definitely knew had got  and never knew they had got it.
Mm.
Yeah I mean but on the other hand the there's probably quite a few that  did read it.
I mean I know when we moved house  I had  folder and one of each had got in it the recycling directory
Mm
which is  quite a nice surprise!
I mean had they had they sold to someone outside Bishop's Stortford
Yeah.
then they could
Yeah.
Erm
I think we have to have something if we have a stall.
We lost all the erm  cartoons   original cartoons.
Yeah.
Oh that's a shame.
Well I could photocopy that couldn't you.
Yeah.
The detail
difficult to see what it is.
But erm
Oh that's a real shame.
"Otherwise I will just do it in a different colour, a different"
I mean then
"You don't get introduced to characters, you don't plunge  straight in."
"Er  yeah, I have thought of  a very different one."
"I mean they don't, er, in the middle of things."
You're not really given any background either.
Yeah.
So
"Shakespeare always usually gives you a bit of  you know, you just got the two gentleman speaking clear and ."
Yeah.
Exactly.
And we accept those things.
"You know, give us a chance to get into the play and get comfortable on our feet and we'll have a go, well, Johnson doesn't give you that option does he?"
"It's straight in there  there's a fight between three, two men and a woman, you don't know what's going on, they're just abusing each other and  and the picture"
is there.
Now Johnson it brilliant for doing abuse.
There's this  wonderful put down.
I'll have  please.
. Erm  okay.
"So in a very different world to that of Shakespearean comedy, a must harsher abrasive  world  erm  again th that bit where she's ge get , do I get the impression that most of you found yours much more difficult to get into"
Yeah.
than Shakespeare?
Yeah.
Mm mm.
Yeah?
Does anybody  have this  ?
"Er, mm"
"Erm, I found it was like reading Shakespeare when I first started reading Shakespeare."
Yeah.
"Cos it's  I think, different types."
Yeah.
You get used to Shakespeare.
Yeah.
"It's, it's, you get used to the way he works."
he said they've er
So did she say she could get some?
Or
"Said she'll ask, said she knows she's got"
giving an errand to take out to the place you know because er if
Well it's dangerous stuff to handle I suppose
Mm
but as you say wanted a tiny amount anyway so
it's a joke isn't it?
you know
Mm
several of us at college
"oh well she'll know by tomorrow night, you could her a call"
you would think
tell me that much
Which pub?
at the college?
"well yes it's only a small amount for you, but er how many students are there?"
Well that's the thing yeah
You multiple that by
getting in a little bit
however many there are
There's about six I think
"Mm, even so I mean he, he's still got to buy it ain't he?"
"Even so, yeah"
So er
Oh they've probably got this much you know
"mm, I mean has he recommended that you use that"
"he, he got"
or are you
Oh I
just taken it in out of the book?
"How's , how's your eye."
"Keep still a minute, let's have a look, come here, Sam, Sam"
"Hey, Sam, Sam , come here."
Keep your head still a minute we want to look at your nutter.
It looks much better doesn't it?
Getting your fur fur back.
"That's right, you see to him, go on you see to him, you see to him,."
"Trouble is Rocky, Rocky's knackered from his walk and so is ."
", hello Davy ."
"That's great , Rocky, Rocky's panting a bit, seems a bit tired but Sam's all fresh."
"He has, he hasn't been very active actually"
There is an unfair advantage here
He was looking
"sleeping in the car today, that's what it is he's just woken up."
Cos I looked  .
He's been asleep in the car .
"didn't get a bite on any of them, not even a take, crabs"
oh the fish are about down there
Where?
can you see?
Seagulls are out there
They're not gonna catch any big ones are they?
"Nothing noticeable, it's normally a good sign though"
put some speed on
you are  oh speed is ninety around here
What?
Speed limit's ninety around here
Seventy
"Yeah, but we always go eighty, they always allow you to go ten"
what is she doing?
Pulling over to the right lane to turn right down the Royston Bypass
"What a prat, she should of been further al further along"
extreme than the other.
So we've got corruption in us probably  so it depends upon the degree
"Well, yes we have."
but you don't expect to get out of the ruddy
Aha.
Socialist Party!
Because
Why not?
"Because I said to yo , I said to you that it was the same in Russia!"
And how much corruption have you discovered in the Socialist Party?
The Labour Party?
Have I discovered?
You mean have I seen
Well how much ?
on the television
Yeah.
these people that
Well what do you
talk with two tongues and say
Well what do you know about them that you say they've
Yes.
they've got er
"What do you base your i , your"

Swimming pool
Erm  swimming pool
who's going to get the information who runs that?
Who?
Mm?
Well I can do that I suppose.
Well who runs what?
The swimming pool
Because I know the scouts do the Tesco one and whenever they are put in these cardboard boxes they have to be sorted so somebody must sort them.
"Oh they're not, they're not asking  sorting, oh I see."
"Erm  so there must be somebody responsible and I think if, if we write swimming pool and people take their cans there"

He said oh I've invited Aunty Joan but nobody else cos I didn't fancy  any of the others.
And has he invited Joan to the day do and that?
Yeah.
But he hasn't invited any  to the night .

Shut up.

That's what I'm saying.
Mm.
from the choir one night and you can say to him  oh my boyfriend's picking me up and then see how .
"Or you, bring me over and introduce me."
Mm.
And I'll say
"you know, I'll say thank you for taking Anna-Marie to, to the Mozart concert."
Mm.
I'll have to do it
But I think she was very .
"It was really, it was really , it was really very helpful to her  at her choir and her practice that night."
Er erm
"Yes, cos I'm gonna have to make up some"
rubbish about
Seeing him.
see my boyfriend isn't too interested in concerts
and that's why I've enjoyed coming out this evening.
"And here, here am I, and then I'll say  you know of course I  you know I'm indebted to you because I realize that, you know, Anna-Marie is quite prepared to go out with other men if she wants to"
but I like  and make sure it's alright.
I'm actually going to join in the choir.
You'll be able to take her
I can't even have a
.
.
Anna-Marie's  told me so much about it .
"And can you tell me the ta , time of trains from  ."
"Yum yum, look, come on over here."
"And that's what he was like on Wednesday night, he said look"
"as so , more or less as soon as he'd said hello he said erm  thirty two and two minutes past the hour, they're your trains."
Aha.
as she always does.
"Since I said, why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was  plenty of children's things local?"
Yes.
So I asked if we wanted anything?
And she said what about the bed at the Cottage Hospital?
What good's a bed with no extra nurses?
Well there are special beds.
Oh you mean a bed?
Well
Tt!
D'ya mean a special kind of mattress be
"Well, she just asked about a bed, so I told her that  we were"
You mean a bed to replace a bed that there already is?
But why's
"She di na she just said a bed, and so"
Yes.
"I told her there were special beds that we have  are very useful, in fact  very necessary in some, some cases, and are  painfully short of them."
Aha.
And a Nimbas bed  costs two thousand pound.
"And there's another one on the market which I can't remember the name of, which costs a lot more."
Mhm.
"Something like, five thousand."
But I can't remember the name.
"Anyway, I said I'd  make enquiries as to what a is wanted."
"And I said there's a, there's a new children's ward  will open at the Wandsbergh Hospital  perhaps they would like something."
"I saw Mrs , and Mrs  said  they were aiming to raise money for the scanner appeal."
Yeah.
"But, also they're going to  have a  an obstetric adult patient's department  at the College Hospital for the very first time."
A what?
A
An obstetric outpatients
Let's face it  you fancy him don't you?
He knows that!
And
Mm mm
"like  he just  I mean he just  you know, he's there isn't he, at the time?"
"He thinks like, okay fair enough  lets have a bit of snog you know, fair enough, whatever else!"
But like
He's so funny though!
"He cracked me up, he goes  like, like with that I mean"
And Shrimpy fancies you rotten anyway!
That's the only the reason!
He's probably just jealous!
"Well like I said, I said that, I said that to Pete and Pete goes, God I wish he'd make up his mind!"
Yeah.
"So he'd obviously sa not said it, I mean Pete was really shocked!"
He'd
Yeah.
obviously not said anything to Pete about me
Mm.
so I dunno!
"He said it to Andy though, and I mean  I don't, I don't know, Andy really surprises me because like  he always seems to be like, the quiet one doesn't it?"
"I mean, when we're all like, laughing and joking and everything he's like, oh yeah really in with it  but when everyone's like arguing or whatever he  he"
Mm.
doesn't get involved because everything revolves round him doesn't it?
Yeah.
"But like  everybody,eve"
It's his house everyone goes to isn't it?
Everybody seems to  Andy seems to know everything!
"Like, Andy knows about me!"
"And like, Scott told me  and  thinking about it  if I'd of been in  in the frame, frame of mind that I'm in know for example, I would of sort of  pah!"
What right has he got to know or anything?
"But like, I don't mind  cos I know he won't say anything."
"We've got twelve people coming, right?"
Er yep  what's that gotta do with anything?
Well cos I'm gonna have  pairs  I think here
And one you!
Oh  singles then?
It's more
No
fun in pairs isn't it cos the people can have the scraggle and talk to each other.
You'll have to have pairs and put one three.
Chips.
Well that's not fair then.
Put Michael with
Oh yeah
"if you put Michael with two other people, it's completely fair."
But then your implying something aren't you.
"Why don't you say if you're a child  you can go in a group of three, if your adults you'll have to be in a group of two, so the children can attach themselves to any group."
Right.
Right.
You've got eleven people you need four groups  you don't have four groups it's not worth doing is it?
"Gotta share it all out perfect even  why don't you say, stick it on the wall, give them each a piece of paper and they've gotta do it  I've got an idea, you can compile a quiz"
Fine I'm
and then you could have a treasure hunt for the children
you know
Couldn't I.
Most amusing
Are you gonna sort of read out the question and they each gonna scribble down their answer.
Nope.
What you gonna do?
"No, just leave"
Have a chart.
your father!
What?
Yeah.
How much did he cost?
Three hundred and fifty.
Three hundred and fifty.
"No it wasn't, it was three hundred."
It was two
Yes it was.
Three hundred and fifty.
"Oh anyway, it was still pretty good wasn't it?"
"Wasn't cheap, I mean"
"No, but I mean you could see   play really well ."
"I mean Southgate's all the more pleasing when you think he's somebody that's worked his way up, right?"
Yeah.
That's really nice to see.
And he played really well.
Southgate is a harder person to mark isn't he?
Yeah.
"I think I'd drop Mortimer  oh look, Palace."
Red car  it's like ours isn't it?
Yeah.
"I'd drop, I'd drop Paul Mortimer"
Yeah.
and have Collymore in right?
"And encourage  that's the trouble, you drop Mortimer you drop somebody who can er flip the ball in but  I think you definitely want to take the heat off Wright."
Now if if all Collymore does is distract   but Mortimer was not playing enough of the game.
"We can't afford  people like Mortimer to, I mean he scored a goal  but I mean"
Yeah.
Eddie  I think is worth  sheer sort of  opening teams up.
"Well he does open, there's no  not many players can play a team better like  than opening up"
"So what'd you do, say you had  back next week so our next game against Birmingham."
What would you do then?
"Well I mean they've got, they've got, he's gotta do something because you're gonna lose that Birmingham game."
La laces are a thing of the past.
Watch this space or something.
Yeah.
Something like that.
I thought it was a built in egg timer or something .

"Oh   I told you didn't I that  er the fellow with the Portakabins that does work for the B B C, he had the Portakabin and then your tables are two pound each, and your chairs range from fifty pence to one pound fifty."
I think the ones that are fifty pence are those blue and white striped ones off the  prom at Prestatyn
job lot.
And er  he didn't say how much the toilet was but that'll probably be separate.
"You know, it's a separate thing so there must be a separate price, it would cost a bloody fortune."

Wheelbarrow ready.

Oh!
Said in yesterday's paper  that someone had had a wheelbarrow  valued at thirty pounds stolen from a back garden  and it was somewhere at Kirk Hill.
Where the back gardens aren't particularly accessible.
"So ours must have cost, I'm sure that would cost them a lot more than thirty pounds."

It is a responsibility.

On the back of every contract.
Because  it is subject to the conditions of carriage  that we accept their business and therefore we have to provide them with written information.

"Anyway he got all his bricks and everything  and er  he got all his ideas what he wanted  and then they turned round and said no, we're not gonna let you build down there."
So we bought his bricks.

Occasionally.
"I mean, at the moment there's no housekeeper so unless I actually say to the maid will you just put something in the oven for me?"
That's it.
That's appalling though!
"And on , on erm  Thursday  Thursday evening before they were going out to Mark  she came home at  just about half one."
She came and made me a ham sandwich  and the maid just look at her   to eat it now.
Brilliant!
There really was not a scrap of .

Mhm.
the music off a sheet.
Right.
Do you have you ever had a go at the piano or that?

"And I trundling along the district line to the Embankment across to Sloane Square  and then hello, hello, I didn't expect to see you here."
Oh oh!
I never met anyone on the tube before from choir.
And I'm sure my face was a picture.

"So I pa , I told one girl in the choir what had happened, and I think to begin"
And what did she say?
with she thought I was overreacting cos she didn't really  respond.
Is she married or what?
"And then , she is married."
"Er erm  and then later on I, I, I think maybe she did realize, you know, cos I said  I wasn't prepared for that and that hasn't happened before."
"I didn't want to think, her to think that I was a show-off, you know"
Yes.

"Oh I'll give you , I'll give you a pound don't worry, make sure you do the job properly, mm  you'd better do it outside, cos the er, the boot polish don't go on the carpet."

Oh!
"And if this chap said, the one that took it that night, he said there is no point in him doing it because he didn't have the coaches insured for enough."

Get their money back.
Yeah.
Get their money from insurance policies and try and make their money back
"I suppose what it really amounts to, it's probably someone who's in the same line of business  and they're trying to get the best way aren't they?"
Mm.
But it's a nasty business isn't it?
I know.
"Well, why, why er, is you know, somebody coming around."
"So I said, Mike, is there a fa something wrong with the phone, and he said, no."
"I said, well, they're just connecting it then, and he said, yeah."
"And I said, or he said, I spent half an hour on the phone, trying to study, he said, she was from Ireland, he said, I couldn't understand a bloody word she was saying."
Oh dear.
"He was going on and on, and erm, I said, well, I'm sure that if you go and pick it up, it will be working."
"So he did, and it was working, and he was so, they just connect it from outside,"
"Oh, I see."
from the line box.
Yeah.
"and erm, so er, it was nothing to do with, like coming into the house"
"Oh,"
to connect it.
"So like, I didn't have to be there for the phone at all."
never turned up so

Where's your parents been then?
"Oh, erm, they're in Cyprus, so"
"Oh, really?"
I pick them up Sunday.
"Sunday, it's really tight."
"Yeah, Annette was hoping that she wouldn't have to work on Sunday."
"It makes the day disjointed obviously,"
Yeah.
"because she's gonna pick 'em up, but she's got to work like you, slap bang in the middle."
"Yeah, mine, mine used to be something like quarter to twelve, didn't it, quarter to twelve till three, and then they decided to change round, it used to be quarter to twelve to six, didn't it?"

He was leader of the
But the first

"Ah, yes well ah, that's got nothing to do with it!"
Oh!

"Duffel coat, he got he got censored"
There's
because he wore a duffel coat instead
Well it's like
That man underneath a duffel coat
What did Ken  say about this chap from Vauxhalls?
"Convena did all his work  and they asked him to go to London  you know, there's some was on years ago  so he goes to the headquarters and he said he just couldn't believe it, he turned on him and said  you're a shallow bloody hypocrite he said!"
Those lads down there they're fighting  living on their ruddy  strike pay  and look at you lot!
He said they were there the whisky was flowing  you know hypocrites!
"And he said, oh come on you're here have a bloody good"
Well
time you know.
on your argument then  anybody who  who works their way up through the ranks and gets to the top  has gotta become corrupted!
"That's what you're saying, no ma"
Mm.
And I think we ought to get him over to one of our meetings.
And  and he said he would.
And I think if we could make it get one of the Uttlesford  chaps to the same meeting
marvellous thing they did.
Yeah.
Well what he did say was don't  you know  don't go over the top in criticizing that because
Yeah.
you know he he says that there's a lot of things which are happening.
He's got all sorts of schemes  a lot of schemes in the pipeline.
I suppose he doesn't want to be seen to be just reacting to your letter he's obviously started doing these things off his own bat anyway hasn't he?
Oh yes.
Yeah.
I mean and and he he feels that er  pressure groups like ourselves are very positive because it gives him a bit of  weight  when he's arguing for things.
Yeah
Well they can't push it from the top
But I mean  on a sort of wider thing  erm
Yeah.
You know one of the things that we could do  is to do another directory.
Yeah.
I think  because I think I think
But
it's a real shame  we're so out of date.
Mhm  but I I you know we we're  can we actually do it?
I mean we would need  fifty people
No I would not distribute it
to deliver
er from door to door.
"I would erm put it out in the library, put it out in in surgeries."
Put it out in public places and that's it because  I mean  the number of people  erm they went to these directories like hot cross buns.
I mean every week I supplied them with a new stack of  everybody wanted them.
"What, the recycling directory?"
My
It's with condensation of fat and everything  er with them just decorating all rooms and that it's
Ah.
"so you can have microwaves, toaster, kettle"
Yeah.
and things like that and that's about it.
Yeah.
Oh I were just wondering.
Can't find clocks.
Can't find bugger all.
Oh so they'll be round here somewhere then won't they?
"Yeah, radio alarm clocks."
"I just wondered how much they are cos that one that er just disintegrated on me, I got it from Britannia."
It's rubbish.
It's never worked proper
Yeah.
"it sort of played about two or three minutes of music and then it went crrrkkkkkk for a few minutes, that's why I kept hitting it."
"And then music, if you hit it, music come back on."
Oh well
Stupid it were.
"Have to have a proper look later, I can't find it."
Ah found one.
"I says I can't find them, I found them."
Here we are
"what's that one, number four, number four   digital clock, mains operated, fast time, alarm set, snooze feature, battery back-up  four ninety five."
Not bad
That's not bad at all that.
No.
Seven ninety nine.
Six ninety five.
Six ninety five and a six fifty.
Very good.
"I will try and remind you about that, er, on other occasions, so that it doesn't er, slip into the recesses."
"Er, and the other thing, just to comment on the programme."
"I hope that we shall have the Deputy Lord Mayor, er, Bob  on the last Wednesday of our session."
"The reason the programme's taken so long, was to find a time when he's available."
"That Wednesday is in the school holiday, although we shall be continuing."
"It means that he can slip out of school, er, in the afternoon, when normally, in nor on a normal school day, he would not be able to do that."
"Erm, so I'm hoping that that will work, it's it's down in the diary for him to do that, and and I've given a little note about what the Adult School is all about."
"And I'll write to him to confirm, and er, if I do bump into him, I shall jog memory of that one."
"Erm, with the change of programme, then, the Black Sheep of the, of the Family."
"Er, which I have already found."
"It is on page a hundred and thirty- nine, for those of you who wish to er, follow."
It starts off with.
"Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have you any Wool?"
How does the black sheep of the nursery rhyme appear to children?
"Other sheep they see, are unlikely to be black, so a black sheep is different."
"They soon learn that anyone referred to as a black sheep, is not only different, but is regarded as being in disgrace."
This is all politically incorrect.
"Yes, yes, yes it is, indeed,"
I was thinking about that.
"isn't it, nowadays."
"Wh wh wha what shall we do, if they were saying a black sheep?"
Erm.
A green one.
"Erm, a green."
"Yes, yes, yes."
"I don't think you can even say, non-white, can you, nowadays."
Yes.
A Jacob.
a Jacobs sheep.
A Jacob.
A Jacob's sheep.
Yeah.
You have a lot of nicknames in the factory?
"Er  well er the just these two people that retired there, er they used to come  this man in a car from , that was their lift to their work."
And it was the days of the C B
Mhm.
"and he had this handle,a and er they were saying, we'll need to get ourself a handle,"
"ah, I said, well what about the Dolly Sisters?"
"So that stuck and eventually when that place folded and we came over here, er we just called them the Dollies and that was, they were referred to, everybody knew who they were,"
Aha.
the Dollies.
Aha.
"So that, that's a bit of it in there."
Aha.
"So you just basically, you all"
"A and, and"
know each other by your ordinary names?
Mhm.
You don't shout nicknames
Mhm.
"at each other, no?"
"Well not in our department anyway, I don't know, I can't speak for anybody else."
"Aha, right."
Although I've worked in nearly all the departments you don't really get to know the people that well.
Mhm.
"have we missed out anything, is there anything"
I don't know.
you'd like to tell us?
Cos we're novices at this.
Och aye.
I mean er does it bother you at all that  well I mean are most of the men managers?
Managers men?
Er the management
Where's the opportunities for like female apprentices and things like that?
Do you know that bit where he was ha looking over the diving board and stuff?
That was Jonathan to a T.
We went swimming with Jonathan the other night and he got up on the top board and sort of and he was sort of like hanging on to the bar like this  looking over
"Oh god, that's  like."
and he couldn't do it and the worse thing was everybody in the pool had gone  go on
"What, what happened was Robert, Rob and me shouted, Robert  and me were there and who was it, Helen was there I think as well, his ex girlfriend  we were going  go on Jon, go on jump   and everybody in the pool started it  go on Jonathan"
"and he couldn't do it, he was so totally embarrassed and all the rest of it, he had to get down and everybody was  boo boo, chicken, chicken"
Oh he felt so wet.
I felt so sorry for him.
Can you do it?
Mm?
No
"Fuck, no way."
I can't fucking
I went off the second board and I had to get out cos I felt sick.
And like I'm not afraid of the water like.
I used to dive off the first board
Yes.
and then I hurt my back
I di I dive off the first board but I couldn't even jump or drop off the second board.
"there was one time I dove in and I hurt my back, I sort of like keeled over, kicked  well"
"Oh I know what you mean  you went in like that and your back, your, your legs went like that there?"
Yeah.
Ooh!
"But I've jumped off the second one, I haven't dived off the second one."
No way.
"I got up, I remember like I'd just  I'd just learnt to dive off the first one  like I was running down like, yes!"
And I got up with the intention of diving off the second one and I went no!
Jumped off it.
Pete   Petey  right?
"I'm not joking, his leg  his legs were about that wide right?"
He wore those new shorts
Yes.
But
But er
.
Excuse the long .
"Page fifty seven please your worship, Robert James , he is in the cells your worship sorry!"
So it will take a moment for him to be bought up.
There are apparently further charges to be put to him your worship  the charge of theft  and we charge him with handling stolen property.
He's only charged with one offence of criminal deception at the moment.
Right..
"Fifty five sir, fifty six."
Are you Robert James ?
Yes sir.
And what is your home address Mr ?
.
Is your date of birth the fourth of September nineteen fifty four?
That's correct.
Are represented by a solicitor today?
Should be.
Was it Mr ?
I have given the  you have all the documents in front of you.
Well  I think Mr  got represented on a previous occasion that's why I'm asking you that!
Well I don't know sir.
My solicitor's in Birmingham!
"My, my records  sir that Mr  was the duty solicitor on that day."
Oh!
I think he's represented you on more than one occasion .
But don't he know that his solicitor's gotta be here for the  today?
I haven't a clue what's happening!
"I didn't know, I mean I could of spoken to ."
"Well you're the defendant, one would of thought yo yo yo know what'll happen to you!"
I haven't .
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
auth authority from the project manager.
"But there may be, there may be"
I think we're discussing two issues here.
"Can we, can we bottom the V O"
Yeah.
one as a start .
"I don't see there's a problem with the V O one, because"
It's
"nobody nobody can issue V Os unless they're delegated to do so, in, in the letter that's signed by me."
I rely on you gentlemen
"And, and they have got the permission of the project manager to spend that money."
Yeah.
Correct.
Yeah.
I rely on you gentlemen to make sure
Too right.
"that the people who are delegated, are competent to discharge those duties."
Yeah.
"An and I must admit that I wouldn't, I would not expect to see anybody delegated within the contract at less than M S one level."
"Because I just don't think they i they're competent to do the duties of the engineer's representative, because you need a knowledge of the contract."
Tt.
Well.
"There are some jobs that, that we get involved with  are very very small"
We've had John  on
Yeah.
John  's been on jobs and he's er
Well.
"He's been as the R E, which is reasonable to be fair."
Yeah.
So's Steve
and what we do we meet up by the golf course
Got a bit of interference there
"Yeah, ah, we meet up by the golf course, cos time I pick"
David up
"David up you there see, I've got to"
the golf course up
So they'll wait for you there then are they?
Well I can get
oh yeah
"and I see, when he sees me park there, flash me, I just follow on, you know"
So I
"what he can do is have something when he gets up, rather than the old"
something sort of
"Yeah well, I don't, I don't get a dinner before I go up to bed."
Well what you got then?
I don't know I think it's Wednesday week
"Well before I go to bed I have baked beans on toast or something like that you know, it's, it's not"
pardon?
Ah?
Oh god
"All of a sudden I'll be home, cor strewth"
you didn't have any of that stuff today then did you?
Yeah I had a glass this morning
Did you?
"Yeah, I've got the shits now I tell yeah"
"eating too much, I suppose if you had a little glass, then just one"
"of that stuff, then some All Bran, you won't be so bad"
No
in fact you had too much you see
No I don't think so
cos you lost none have you?
Yes
"So, what I'm saying is they're just th , they're, they're, it's just for er"
The biggest place near it.
the biggest place near it.
Now what
"I'm saying is, is you ought to get very close to that geographical map  because  it's the logistic  logistics er  difficulty with getting, and you ought to know where there are mountains and where there are valleys and the fact that that, in South Wales they can't just go across country, they have to go back down the valley after the M four and up again."
"Cos we're driving lorries, we're not driving little, you know  trial bikes that go over mountains like the Brecons and stuff, you have to"
But we do use the sheep in some ways don't we?
"That's right, that's right, we do use the sheep ."
But not for
No.
the sake of the .
"No, right."
What
"what I'm saying is, you know, you can't go from Stirling to Aberdeen  in a couple of minutes."
That's big country up there.
"And so there's a big mountain range running up the middle of the country, someone thought once was the English Channel."
Well that's okay cos we've got a tunnel now.
"Yeah, we got a tunnel now."
Yeah.
"The English Channel, not the Pennines."
But they're going where's the Pennines?
Erm what I'm saying is
I'd say I don't know where it is at all.
I am saying to you now folks become familiar with the erm  depots.
Now what about the depot numbers?
No idea.
No.
Forty nine.
Not at all.
Forty six.
Forty nine.
I'm gonna call them out.
Yeah within the nearest place with  a biggish
With a  yeah.
football team possibly yeah.
Anyway
Right.
Right so er
I think that's everything.
Yeah.
"So if I get it laid out again then, you know"
"Yeah fine erm but as I say it's just sort of you know kind of minor layout changes, that's all I was suggesting"
Yeah.
"so you know at a pinch you could probably run it like that and I don't suppose anybody would notice the difference but, you know, just in terms of you know making things look attractive"
Right.
"erm  so  you know but you may find if you give, print off a few and give them to a few people over the weekend"
Mm.
you may find that some additional changes occur to you
Mm.
which you might want to incorporate anyway so you may not want to print off another version anyway
Yeah.
so er
"Erm oh yeah the other thing was  it's two sided at the moment, is that"
Mm.
best or do you think
Erm generally speaking the consensus is it helps if it's sort of on one side
Oh right.
but how you do your original is up to you I mean it's just what we ask for from reprographics and you know they do single sided
Okay yeah.
"double sided, collated, stapled"
"different coloured paper and all, you know, all this sort of thing"
Yeah.
"so er erm  er  so that's  no, is there anything else we need to worry about  with regard to that?"
Er no I don't think so.
"But the problem is the lower level at that,i i i it's at the N C O level where complaints are made by soldiers and because the complaint has to be made through the regiment, then the the pressure is for the soldier to withdraw his complaint  ."
"Rea really brief so how widespread is it in the Army, bullying or intimidation?"
"How how can we tell, because as an officer, and this is this is Richard's point, as an officer how do you know what goes on in the barrack room?"
Nicky can I have a word ?
With wa Andrew I've got somebody else to speak to.
If I
Okay.
get a chance I'll come back to you.
Er where's James ?
James.
Now you're on the run from the Army at the moment?
Mm.
Er why did you run away?
"Er mental torture, I just couldn't handle it no more."
What were they doing to you?
Er I was handcuffed to a radiator in the nude and urinated on.
I was tied into a sleeping bag and hung upside down from a tree overnight.
Er
"Why did they pick on you do you think Andrew, er James ?"
My size.
Yeah.
And you know
Did you s did you te did you say for god's sake stop doing this to me?
"Did you try and stop them, did you try and make them see reason?"
"Th there was no point, the chain of command to make a complaint was blocked."
There was just no way.
Did you see this happening to other people?
Yeah.
What sort of things were they doing to other people?
"Erm two people back to back with their trousers round their ankles, newspaper shoved up their backside, lit in the middle, first one to move got a kicking."
And is this common?
Or were these just a few isolated sadists ?
"But the people who  Q T S course, have got a lot of work."
Have they?
"Mm, much more than me."
I'm glad I'm not doing that.
Really?
Loads of assignments have been set already.
"They're really quite heavily bogged down, and they were to do them all, er one day at school."
"Really, bloody hell."
Yeah the teachers seem to do nothing do they?
Really?
"I mean, Ann finished lectures, Ann's finished lectures yesterday, she's a secondary teacher and she doesn't have a lecture again until after Christmas."
Really?
"And she's got another two weeks off now, until she goes into schools and then she's in the schools full-time, but even so, she won't have, she didn't have exams."
"She had exams last January, didn't she, and she hasn't had exams since last January, she won't have until next  during June."
Really?
"And like, she has, like, although she's doing secondary teaching, she has it easier than anybody."
Mm.
"At this stage, anyway."
"I mean, it'll probably get harder."
"I wouldn't mind doing that, if there was, if I could do secondary teaching."
Really?
Mm.
"But I wouldn't wanna do primary or junior, just"
"Well do, would you be, is it T T S, secondary, T T S, weren't it?"
"No, but"
primary
"Well, in T T S"
T T S they can't do secondary.
Only do primary and junior.
"Oh, no in, in our college they're doing secondary."
"Cos I asked them about it, and they said  I'd much rather be doing that."
"Mm, yeah I would really."
Yeah.
"You paying me in 'and, and Dennis is paying me in 'and and I'll a er, thousand pound a week, the way that  I keep getting these job offers."
Back-handers.
Anticipation obligations.
The only trouble is they're only offers.
"What's happening down here, then, didn't you hear no more about when you finish then, down here at"
No.
"Only some bad  things, what I've supposed to have done, or what I'm not supposed to have done."
But
Who cares over it.
"some money out of it, I took him to court."
proven.
Oh.
But you can't do it without money.
"No, that legal aid don't go far"
"Legal aid, won't enter enter entertain it."
Not for owt like that.
"No, I'm afraid"
"You see, 'cos you weren't actually employed, you see, 'cos you say,"
No.
"you couldn't really take him to a tribunal could you, 'cos ya"
"No, I weren't employed."
any money to take him to a tribunal.
"Well, I made my, I made it plain that er, at the training centre, you know, I says, I says to em, I said er, in my opinion, I says, he doesn't want, he don't want to kn , he he don't want to know."
"Oy, you."
"He says any anything what goes wrong, he says, you automatically get blamed for."
I told you.
"He says, well, it's your job not to let it go wrong, I said, I didn't let it go wrong."
"I said, but other people let it go wrong and they got away with it."
Look what I found.
I've just called for her money.
Corrinne's money.
Is it more or less straight up?
More or less horizontal?
About forty five or?
It's probably about seventy.
Right.
"Maybe seventy, maybe eighty."
"So you could draw a rough sketch like that,"
Mm.
"just measure it with a protractor, or measure along here."
That would be  if we drew wh wh how do we find the gradient really?
"We draw a little triangle, don't we?"
Yeah.
"So at point one, it's nought."
"What would, what would that be at the point two?"
For X
Three.
equals two?
Two three.
"So we could get the point two three, and we could take the gradient of that as being fairly close to the gradient of the curve."
Mm.
Erm how can we get it more accurately reflecting what's happening there?
Right.
Point something.
So if we did something like that that's where we want it.
That's where we want the gradient
Mhm.
"and we took a line from there to there, where this is that's where X is equal to, that'll go far."
Nought nought point nine say.
"And just the other side of it, where X equals one point one."
Mm.
"We're going to have, difference along the X axis will be nought point two."
Yeah.
"However you decide to, by instalments or by"
"Mm, mm."
"one, one big lump."
Mm.
"But at the end of the day, it ain't really what I want to do."
No.
"I mean I, I want to get into mental health care."
Mm.
"And and erm  if I  I'm hoping I'll like it when I get in there, but something tells me I would."
Well as I say I went for this interview and she phoned me last Sunday didn't she?
"I went on the Monday for the, to the house."
Then on the Tuesday I went to the hospital.
And erm  she phoned me up on the Sunday.
She said I'm  I'm just ringing to tell you Joy that you didn't get  you you haven't been successful with your application this time.
"But she said  erm I wanna just tell you  all the others  that haven't made it, we've just said well I'm sorry."
That's it.
"But, with you, we feel you've got so much to offer  and we don't really wanna just say no and  and  and it would make you feel oh blow it I'm not gonna do it."
Mm.
"She said I feel that  there is a place for you in the health, in this mental health service."
But she said  what it is is basically we're all just starting from the bottom because this new idea of where they're buying small homes and making them small communities
Yeah.
erm  they're all starting from new.
They're all been institutionalized up till recently.
That's right yeah.
So they're gradually buying houses in certain areas.
And she said I'm sure you'll get in.
"But you see it's like everything else, we're in a recession."
"You, you go for a job and there's two hundred people going for that one job."
Mm.
Mm.
"That's right, yeah."
There's three hundred and eighty went for a job up the Hilly Home Where they have the spastic kids.
Ours is gonna us about a thousand pound for insurance.
Oh.
"Well, a thousand pounds not a lot, Karen, but er  it all depends what the, what what you gonna be insured for?"
It's not.
"I mean, even that, you're gonna you you gonna be insured for breaking in and break-ins and"
"Yeah, I think it's everything."
I think it's
"That's what I mean, so what you're actually getting for your, thousand pound isn't a lot of money."
No.
"I think it's covered for like, like you say, like for some reason, say you had a fire, and you had to stop work."
Yeah.
I think it's covered for that.
"Covered for personal injury, er, covered for hundred thousand, for like, that's what trailers,they've got  trailers in."
It's covered for everything.
"I mean, you imagine somebody breaking in and setting fire to a trailer."
"I mean, it's a lot of money when you think Norma's paying nine hundred pound just for her car."
For that Cabriolet.
"To me, you think phew a thousand pound, but cer I mean, it's it ain't really very much, no."
It's a high insurance for a car.
What for car?
yeah.
Right
"What how how comes that, then?"
"Because, well, Cabriolet's are classed as dangerous, aren't they, because they're  soft roofed."
"Oh, aye."
It's not got no
"Aye, this"
"Yeah,she's only been driving a year, two years."
"Soft top, yeah."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean, look at our Connie's."
Yeah.
I didn't know women were allowed to go.
"and er just at the very end all you could see was her  and your man, the hologram  and he'd just been killed about five minutes earlier."
So he could have saved himself but he didn't want to.
The hologram?
Aye.
And did he not save himself then?
No.
Did he die?
But then how can  go on.
Cos he's still he's still a hologram.
Hologram.
So that's how he died then?
Aye.
Well it's funny
Remember he tried to stab his wife
I cried my eyes out at that!
at the very start of last night there was this guy water skiing
"big massive fat woman right, and she was just walking about this conference, you know where she's not supposed to be, and all these shoulders  stab her right?"
And then
Shoulders?
"Soldiers, right, stab her and they're all dying and then you see the head like  it's just all dressed up in these things and it's Arnie underneath it  and he takes the head off"
and it closes up again and he goes  chew this or something  blows up and then Arnie gets
"No there's a scene in Terminator, he's like wood and metal, in this new Terminator"
Yeah
it is absolutely brilliant the way they do it.
What was that what was that
Well you'd run a mile
Oh aye.
That one er under the water
The Little Mermaid  no.
"it is fucking brilliant,in a monkey suit."
Oh a cartoon?
Oh good.
and waiting for his next one to come
Oh marvellous.
Er
Is he selling them over there?
"No he's keeping them for just fun cars for himself, he's just got the money to burn over there"
Marvellous
"so  he's only, he's got a  one of the new  B M W seven three five that er no the big Merc, a big new Merc through that's right, not the  the latest Merc  so he says er er he's a bit disappointed with the brakes on the M G but  Dave said they were a phenomenal brake for an  M G he said"
Yes.
compare it against the latest Merc
That's right.
He's all
I expect
he's all been paid all his money and
"Mm but it's good in a way that he's got his money because he can sort of, sort of finance ours"
"Well yeah he is, he's got a little bit anyway"
"till we, yeah yeah, I should imagine he is."
quite a few bits and pieces.
It's getting Kevin in to finish it off.
"I phoned Kevin, I've got Kevin's mum and dad's phone number off Dave and phoned at home but he's gone out for the day or something they said."
"But he's got to strip the bonnet so Dave said well I'll get my lad to strip the bonnet this afternoon and er  you know,few hundred quid for the day we'll be glad to be able to finish off doing them and  He's got too many"
Yeah cos you haven't been able to
to play with really er we c to clear ten we've still got two and a half grand left
Have we?
and so there's twelve and a half grand we're owed
Yeah yeah
"so if he charges, you know, fifteen hundred for his bit and then another grand to finish it off we're still clearing ten, you know,"
Oh well that's good then.
we might even clear a little bit more than ten but
"Bit more than ten, yeah."
"I mean if he charges two and a half I wouldn't be disappointed cos it's been in his garage, he's pushed everything along and he's always  so"
"Yeah, oh and he's been pretty reasonable hasn't he?"
I like being in with my family.
He said I like being in with me boys.
"He said, and it's really good, he said, cos I'm, I'm celebrating my fortieth birthday, he said, and I ring my boys, he said, and they listen to the same sort of music I do."
"He said, whereas my mum over there in the corner, he said, if she had a bash I had to listen to bloody Frank Sinatra, wouldn't I?"
"And I'd go, yeah."
It's like yeah.
"He said, yeah, I like being home with the family."
"He said, but I'm only going back out there another  he said, so it won't be too long."
"I said, yeah."
it's not.
Fancy Jane going and having a bust-up down the
"I'm not surprised, Christ."
"She's relaying all marital problems, to everyone, wouldn't she."
"They're alike though, ain't they?"
Did you see her when she
Busting out of her dress.
"Erm, your, I think it was Dwayne or was it, it's either Dwayne, or erm, er Bob knocked a glass over, and er,Jane was like erm, trying to like, she was like going Edward move away, I'm trying to sh I'm trying, look, I'm trying to stop people dancing round here, and like, these, all this, this er, glass on the floor, right, Jane was standing there going like this, dancing round all this glass, and like she was going like this, and everyone that walked past, she was going,broken glass   and she was saying, and  she was, she kept on going broken glass, they done it."
"And she's still dancing, it's really funny ."
She's  ain't she?
Oh dear.
She started crying one
"Yeah, I know she did, I saw her."
Shouldn't keep smoking and fighting in the middle of the front room.
She was crying in the pub.
Talking about how much she hated
The bloke
"He's so drunk, he don't ."
"She goes,piss off ."
Yeah.
"So they had another big fight down there, didn't they?"
Oh dear.
"Yeah, I went in the kitchen, and"
I've spent too much money already so
"Did you get my message, then?"
Yes.
It's about an asylum.
He's a really nice chap.
Is it her
He was very young.
He was right along the end without a sink.
Ah.
Yes.
"without a sink, he's got the only room without a sink"
"He, he said, I said is Joanne in, and he went, oh, I don't think she is, actually."
"And I went, there's a message here for her, if Rebecca phones, I went, yes, I'm Rebecca, oh, right, okay."
"You leave a message like, and it's like, erm, I'll pop over and see you,and I was like, I mean, he just paused for breath, and I went, well, what time, and he went, well hang on, the message hasn't finished yet."
"So I went sorry, sorry, and he went, it's alright, and he went in, oh, thanks for that, thanks very much."
"He went, okay, then."
"He said, I'll give her the message, I tell her that everything's fine."
"I said, yeah, tell her that I got the message, and that you know, it's all fine."
"Okay then, right, see you later."
Bye.
I spoke to him last night as well.
"I mean, when I think I was  with my bags and things and he went,Jo, the message has gone through, everything's fine  I went,your sister, I relayed that little message which I thought was  which I thought was rather comical, you see, and I said, oh did you, and he said yeah."
"He said, everything's okay, she's got measles."
He's a nice bloke.
Yeah.
He seems like fluid poems.
Her and Kate will come and see me at four o'clock  and her and Kate will come and visit you.
"They will not be coming to the cinema, and I was like, what time are they gonna come, and he was like, hang on, I haven't finished yet."
"four o'clock, and he was like read it and he   oh,only fed ten P in and I got all the information that I needed to know."
"Yeah, I've written it all out in block."
Mm.
"He was only seventeen, wasn't he?"
they starts running off!
"Well I crapped mesen me, I started running back towards road and they're going Sarah, Sarah come back."
"So I carried on walking and they start going through this bleeding wood, well they had me climbing over three fence things, all like them metal  you know like them metal fences at  wood?"
"Climbing over them, I nearly cut mesen in half."
park.
"Oh yeah we walked past park cos he asked me if I wanted to go on swings  and it led up to his back gate, well, you've never seen me put a sigh of relief on me face, I went"
Is it a longer or a shorter?
It's shorter but it's scarier.
Scarier?
They're on about putting a road round back of there.
Around back of the gardens.
"I tell you something if they put lights up down here I reckon it'd make it even more scary though you know, I don't know why."
Scary.
I hate that road.
Just think there could be dead bodies in
You know what it made me think of?
What?
"Parts of flipping Evil Dead, and they're going ooh there's a house"
Oh I couldn't walk through a wood on a night time.
No way.
We found a tramp in wood once.
Dead?
No.
He were under these covers and erm
Well you were then .
"we walked up we, we thought oh what's this?"
Lifted cover and there were this fella underneath.
"And erm we ran off, I were, we were about sixteen or seventeen  and er  we kept chucking bricks at him."
"He, he was going piss off, piss off."
So you know Dallas?
"He chucked this bit of glass, it cut him so we ran over here."
"And erm  I don't know who it was, he set fire to his quilt"
That's not a moo cow.
Get down.
It is.
It is.
It isn't.
Mooo.
That's it.
That's what moo cows do.
You're crackers.
It is.
It is a moo cow.
"I mean like er, Eileen was saying summat yesterday, she said, she said I don't er, have  at home, she said, I decided to  I said I'm frightened, and sometimes  knows I'm not frightened."
"I said, I'm frightened someone's in the 'ouse, I'm frightened not waking everybody  well, well what do you do, I says, you don't, unless you have a go, you don't, I mean, if I'd turned out  you know, you don't really know."
I know.
"I mean, that"
"You might, and then again, you might be a millionaire inside three months."
"Yes, I said to her, think about it, I I was that frightened, I frightened meself to death, and I I wouldn't I wouldn't."
I hated it.
That's what I used to do every time I thought about selling 'ouse
You just got to do it.
Yeah.
"I thought about it, and thought about it, and then then changed my mind."
But this time I decided it's what I want to do and bugger it.
"If we don't sell it, we we haven't lost anything."
Oh well.
sell it till we move.
I honestly think myself
As long as we're not worse off than what we were before we moved.
"I honestly think meself, that I might have a have a couple of hard months, maybe three, first three months might be a bit difficult for me."
"Oh, it probably will be."
"Well, I think, once he gets established, and once he starts getting work in, I think meself, that work will start, won't say rolling in, but I think the work'll start coming in after about three months and I can get established."
Oh we can always lend you a couple of ten pences.
Well maybe sometimes it's not their fault.
Most of the time people don't want to be
Yeah.
on the street.
But how do you know that?
"I mean, how could you be so sure it isn't their fault?"
They tell us.
Well those people out on the streets tell me that all the time.
"I mean, have you seen the reports?"
Of course I've seen the reports!
I'm not blind!
"Well the majority of them are a , abused or get thrown out of mental centres, I mean, some of them just run away from home because they want to  and that's only a minority, lots of them have"
I mean
very good reasons!
Well it's still not my problem is it?
Yeah!
It's everybody's problem!
Stop voting Conservative you stupid old bag!
"Yeah , and if you vote for"
There's nothing wrong with being Conservative!
"I i if Labour ca party came in the unemployment would be, unemployment, homelessness would be"
Have you got a family?
even worse!
Of course I've got a family!
How large?
If you don't mind me asking?
I have three children!
How old are they?
And have any of them contemplated running away?
Well how do I know!
I would !
"There's  one's fourteen, one's sixteen, and one's nineteen."
so they don't have the problem of of of of of
Yeah
the hassle of stocking it and so on.
Yeah.
So you know
I've just got this David  thing and and the  thing in the background.
I didn't want to tread on toes.
Well well you've got a lovely you've got a lovely opportun
You've got a lovely opportunity there to sell the non-price benefits.
Yeah.
Just have a try and h try and set up a c a a a meeting with this Sally and your engineering winger
Yeah okay.
and don't talk price at all.
No.
And than at a later stage go bock and have a go at Sally and and remind her of all these good things that you talked about .
The problem is we're buttoned down on deliveries on standard bearings cos of the balls up about .
Well okay so you've got to talk
.
you've got to talk your way through that.
It's the precision bearings that's really the prize.
I mean that's why .
Yes.
"And and and of course now that er now that we've got the total business beginning to operate as one, the chances of letting them down on standard bearings is very much smaller than it ever was before."
Yeah.
The problem the reason we've let her down on standard bearings is because of this changeover.
Mm.
Oh yeah.
You see it's got nothing to do with the with our
No no.
competence as a supplier.
No.
Yeah okay.
Yeah.
I just saw somebody put it on them on the .
I used to be quite good at
and I'll ask again on Tuesday when I ring.
It's supposed to be very good for you.
"I used to be very good at this, I use to  ."
So did I
"Yes, you did, yes."
We'll put it on the list and I'll try on Tuesday for you.
.
So that's all I've got with me after I've been to .
"Well, you've  anyway, so."
"If they're more than eighty, I, I can't have it anyway."
So you want to keep
"Yo-yo,."
Oh .
"I'm all ready if I got my handbag, but when I start walking because of the cars being broken into I don't carry a handbag, you see, I just carry money in my pocket."
"Oh, there's a lot had their cars broken into ."
"I've had mine done twice, mine done twice, mm, the police were up the other day lying in ambush, and I'd spotted them and phoned the local police station and said there's men lurking in the bushes of  are they policemen?, she said yes madam, they're policemen."
"I don't, I thought they looked to they looked to clean and, and well groomed"
Yeah.
"to be erm, sort of scroungers."
"Right, it doesn't pay to leave your handbag in the car."
No way.
Certainly doesn't.
It isn't the money because the insurance company pay me back the money
"Yeah, yeah."
"the car insurance mends my windows, but it's, it's your bank books, and your credit cards"
I know.
and your driving licence
I know.
"your insurance, all those little things you know, and you don't"
I know what's coming.
You you know what's coming.
George Miller called this the span of conception.
The capacity of the brain to conceive or hold on to any information.
You'll see there we've got three boxed a six number a ten number and a twelve number.
What I'm gonna do is just speak out a six digit number.
What I want you to do is try and hold on to it in your brain then when I've finished write it down in the appropriate box and see if you can hold on to it long enough to do that.
"So the first number, listen to this the first number and try and hold on to it."
Three eight one five six two.
Just write that down.
. Okay?
Let's try and ten digit number then.
Listen to ten digits try to hold on to them and then write them down.
"Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've gone wrong
"Okay, try a twelve digit, just for the experiment."
"Try and hold on to twelve numbers, here we go."
Listen to these.
"Nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven."
". Now that's it's interesting what Joanne said that you you lost it in the middle somewhere, yeah?"
I mean er let's just read them just see how you got on.
"Three, eight, one, five, six, two."
"Okay, Seven, four, two, nine, eight, one, three, four, seven, six."
I've got the  mixed up
"Yeah and nine, O, five, one, six, two, four, seven, three, eight, two, seven"
say that one again
"nine, O, five,one, six, two, four, seven, three , eight, two, seven."
Nearly got it .
So but I mean where was it.
Was it generally in the middle or at one end or
"The first, the first two numbers"
yeah okay
East end then.
Oh he's got a nice shirt on.
"in a pub he was, got drunk and for a twenty pound bet shaved off all his hair."
I still owe him the money.
But he is stupid cos he went hitchhiking once and left a day early to avoid traffic.
"Here, do you know what I fancy?"
I fancy an icecream.
She said well I'll go and get you one.
"He said no, you know what your memory's like, you're bound to forget."
"She said no I won't, what do you fancy?"
"He said well  I fancy  vanilla and strawberry icecream with chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce, crushed nuts and a flake."
"She said right, vanilla and strawberry icecream, chocolate sauce, crushed nuts."
"said right, I shall be back in five minutes."
Two hours later she come back with a ham sandwich.
He said you silly cow!
You forgot the mustard.
East end.
This week on handy hints we are talking fishing.
I once went for a job as a fisherman.
"The boss said Connolly you've got the job, you start on Monday."
"I said that sounds alright, could I have a sub?"
He said no you're on a fishing boat like everybody else.
Well one of the greatest qualities a fisherman can have is of course patience.
And you can spend the whole day without a bite.
"As for me, I always take my packed lunch."
And pot noodles is one of my favourite dishes.
No.
I don't think  that the pub is open  the cafs aren't open  the amusements aren't open.
The bar's open.
No.
All locked up and in darkness.
?
no.
But she
Ov over a month ago.
"When they came on Sunday, when it were your anniversary, she'd got diarrhoea and sickness, Margaret."
I think she were off work last week.
Yeah.
"I I mean, you're anything like that, but not not for a month, I mean."
I got two toilet papers on .
Oh yeah.
"Well, put one in your pocket then,"
I  Margaret  last night.
"Oh I I bet  if you look at it,"
I don't Pete's been to me mum's for about six months.
Because I can't remembering him going.
He never goes without Margaret.
"She always goes herself, she were down there last night, by herself."
He were at pub.
Mm.
"Well, I said to her, told her about not having nowt to eat from that Wednesday morning, er Wednesday dinner time, till Thursday when they went"
Well she took away fish last night for her supper.
Oh.
"And that she she looked shocked, you know, she didn't didn't know me like, and er, well she was shocked, and then I said I said, right  well we'll have to get together and sort something out about stopping with her, and Pete said straight away."
"Margaret's there every day, she goes out every morning."
Right.
Not that he actually asked her.
years ago about Beryl.
I told you that's what he said.
"And I said, aye up, I don't mean in day-time."
"I says on a night-time, I said, you know, she can't leave her home now, I said, she can't manage to put coal on fire, and she can't manage to get up up to eat and drink and that, I said, I don't mind dropping off and taking me turn on the night-time but I mean, but it's hard, it's hard with me with kids every night."
It's  for you with kids.
"But I don't, certainly don't mind taking her down once a week or twice a week and taking me turn."
"Karen there's no need, no need, you're needed at bloody home."
Six.
So the gradient
Six .
"Wh when you do it to sort of fairly accurately like that, it  six."
"When we did it fairly roughly, it came to one point two?"
Yeah.
"Erm  six Because, because we didn't do this bit did we?"
That should have gone I think that was wrong.
That should have been six times nought point two over
Minu
Yeah.
Which again comes to six.
"So, that's more like it."
"What's the, what angle has a tan of six, then?"
Now it'll be in the seventy or eighties.
Eighty.
Eighty?
Good.
to be fifty.
Erm you can do that with any curve.
"If I gave you sort of X to the seventeen or something, well you could put two values in."
"And you could bring them fairly close together and say well I can't tell you exactly what the gradient is at that point, but if you draw a tiny little line and take the gradient of that."
Mm.
"That's er that's good enough, that's close enough."
That's a very good approximation.
Yeah.
"So gradients are a very important part of, of sketching a curve."
Erm you already pointed out some of the important points where the gradient gets to zero.
"Erm  does, does  things that might be interesting?"
Okay.
"You've already mentioned it earlier, actually, symmetry."
Not always symmetrical about this axis.
But it's still cheaper than a pub.
"Yeah, yeah."
So we'll have  a couple of drinks and that's it for tonight.
Mhm.
"Jane said that last week, cos I thought it was a disco, cos when it first described it me, it was real crap, and there was this colour guy and his friend, and all they wanted to play was  black, they looked like they got no bones when they were dancing."
"You know like, dislocated themselves."
It's really
"Really, oh no."
"And in fact, all they played all night."
"The funny thing was, I find this really amusing, the bloke who was running the disco, he was putting loads of records on, then going dancing."
"Really, excellent."
How was he doing that?
"Yeah, he really did, and the record would end, and then he'd plonk back."
So they were just playing the music that they liked.
It was only those two dancing all night.
"Oh, what."
"That's what made it so obvious, because it was, he would put the records on, and then come out and start dancing, and I thought I'm not going that  No, they played that,sh what's it, shake, shake, shake the room,"
bought that.
"Oh, she didn't, oh remember the other day,Take That."
I didn't ask.
Oh.
I didn't even  supposed
Would it?
"She said, yeah."
"ought to see  lounge, she's got Take That disco, and Take That"
"Oh, Jesus, she's driving us up the wall."
She's trying to go out and get tickets to see 'em.
Is she?
She's got tickets.
"That's the trouble, but we got a note through the door this morning from our friend Kerry."
Don't buy the Take That tickets.
"I'll explain later,and she's  last night ."
No.
As we was just coming home.
"She stood there  yabbing at the end of the counter, when are you coming out!"
He said oh for God's sake shut up Kim!
So she said er  shut up your fat    !
She didn't!
"He said I've told you before he said, if you ever say that again he said I was gonna knock your head off!"
And anyway I  walked past him and he went back and he was sh moaning at her  so erm  two of the old boys he'd been working with said whatever's all that about?
So there.
I said oh another one!
"I want well out of it, so course she come in  got changed, so he said to me I would like you tomorrow  to have a word with Robin  about stopping her coming down  to us he said because erm  it makes me feel very uncomfortable he said  and we had that hassle he said  it's a load of nonsense he said  I've forgotten"
Well I suppose it does make him feel uncomfortable.
"Yeah  he said I've forgotten about it  Blue's forgotten about it he said, but she won't let it rest he said  he said it's Well she's a child, she's only a child Geoff that's"
Yeah.
why.
Yeah he said I'm not having he says.
"She's like a spoilt child, she's gotta learn to"
"Yeah, he said"
from there soon.
"That's what he said, he said she can throw a tantrum he said and get everybody sort of feeling sorry for her he said, as and when she wants he said."
"Well I suppose it probably wasn't tha , a complete pack of lies Geoff."
"Yeah  so he said I I want ca , Robin to stop her coming down here he said."
So you've gotta be the one who tells him.
Yeah  so Ivan said
Well I think he's right.
"yeah, so Ivan said to me, he said er  he said well I do I suppose you have noticed he said but whenever she comes down here he said  the whole line stops  I said I quite agree  I said well let's be honest about it if he's knocking out the meat he , it's gotta stop  cos he  stops"
Jonathan !
"he stops talking to, stops to talk to her I said and obviously if the meat isn't coming out the box, the meat isn't coming out of the box!"
Well that's right.
Well that is right innit?
Yeah.
But she's like a child really  you gotta pity her really haven't you?
Can see me tonight can't you?
"Ah you are going to be so arsed, it's going to be so funny."
"I won't be that bad, I won't have any ci er  get one  gotta get some, have to  now cos we're not gonna have any."
I doubt if I'm gonna get  Phyllis is there.
Phyllis and Johnnie  .
"I call them  but it's not, it's ."
Oh I've got a sore knee ooh
It's no wonder!
"I've got fluid on it, it hurts."
Ooh
"Well you go to sleep bef when they've gone, when they go out"
"Yeah, have a bit of a kip for a bit can't I?"
I doubt if erm we'll be down here before she goes up to mine  I don't reckon.
When?
"Yeah she is, she's dropping in"
"for after, after mum and dad go  have the hand slapping and the  yeah they've gone!"
Anyway I wanna have a bit of a talk to her.
What about?
Well about all this business with Shrimpy.
"Yeah but you, you must admit Shrimpy's trying his damn hardest."
"I, I, I mean I don't know, I wasn't there for half the things she was talking about last night, I mean I was upstairs for three quarters of an hour trying to go to sleep"
"Yeah well I mean I was there and all they did was they didn't say anything to each other, in the same room, just acted totally normally but didn't say anything to each other ."
Shrimpy's trying his flipping nice to try and let this drop and just .
"We all know he still fancies her  he's just trying to, you know  keep it  he's just trying to forget it and try and act as normal as possible with her and hopefully things will get back to be back to  what, what they were."
"But flipping Scott, mister interferior"
Interferior ?
Yeah interferer.
"Flipping  no, it really annoys me that does."
They're always going on about how much Shrimpy  gets other people involved and  can't  stick up for himself aren't they?
And bloody  Scott runs rushing off and thinks he's mister hard man.
What sort of things are you gonna say anyway?
"Well I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna say that Joanne's a bit worried about Shrimpy  which is true"
"Now it looks like, ah just stopped moving again, straight line, fixed speed that, this looks as if it's accelerating."
"It's very, it's deceptive if you're not working out what you're doing and relating it back to the graph, and relating it back to physics, to an experiment you're doing, someone's checking the clock every second to see how much further it's gone."
"Oh well, in the last second it went another ten metres."
Last second it went another ten metres.
It's going at a steady speed.
Fixed constant velocity.
"But here, that's still where it was last time I checked my watch."
Yeah.
Not moving.
So that's a steady speed.
And it stops.
"That's, it changes  abruptly."
From a steady speed.
It doesn't need to brake or does it just?
Mm.
"If it's a physical body, to change speed, it'll have to have to brake."
"And the s what would, so, that's a fixed speed."
There's another str another straight line  .
"There's another straight line, another fixed speed."
Which one is faster?
"Every one second,ten metres."
Every second that's going more than ten metres
Right.
So that
So the steeper it is?
The faster.
The faster it's going.
"So at this point, it's almost flat."
So it's going very slowly.
Now what's happening to its speed?
Accelerating.
Yeah.
That's three sixty five please
Two four five  sixty five
Thank you
Thank you  Thank you.
You haven't given me the bits missing from the Mirror.
Well that's erm
Well I'm sorry but my Daily Mirror was dev delivered this morning without the television supplement and without the comic and I want them
the actual page?
The whole supplement that come on Saturdays
That part
That part wasn't in?
This part was not in.
"And there's usually a free comic as well, and that wasn't in either."
And that's the second time in the past four weeks that those pieces have been missing from it
Well
"No, I don't need the whole paper."
I've got the rest of it.
I canna gi' you one under there though
"Well you're going to have to because when I pay for a paper, I want it to be complete, so I want that piece and I want th that piece, no wait a minute, where is it?"
Which is the television?
Where does this start?
That's forty change.
Thanks a lot.
There we are.
"Right, so I've got the two pieces that are missing from my paper"
"Well, I've already paid for mine so I'm going to get"
"Well, you'll just have to tell them that it's missing but when I've paid for a newspaper I expect to get all the pieces that I've paid for and I've already paid for mine, so this I'll take."
Thank you
Hello
Hello
Hello
raises a lot of money through sponsorship  few people committing money every month.
"What we did before, was we did counting in flows and circulating."
"I think what we would do  supposing we didn't, supposing we just had  heavy vehicles and light vehicles?"
That's gonna make things a lot easier isn't it?
"Yeah well we, for Queensferry we just had  three classes."
"Motorbikes, cars, light goods  H G V including two three and four axle and buses  for the, for the whole count, now for the samples  Rob didn't even want it classified."
It was just a vehicle regardless  of what it was.
Yeah.
I suppose we could do a classified count  er on the A four eight seven sort of a bit away if we wanted a proper classified count couldn't we?
Yeah.
"Separate, on another day."
Yeah.
Or we could just use whatever we get at the interview side.
Erm  perhaps the thing to do is to look at  how it varied in nineteen eighty six.
Did you get that report out?
Yes you did.
How it varied between the two sides.
There's three thousand one hundred there.
Mhm.
That's two way.
On a twelve hour day.
"So assu you're talking about, well supposing that 's grown, it may be four thousand, so you're talking about two thousand tr vehicles in the interview direction  over twelve hours."
So you're gonna want to interview  forty percent right?
How many do you think you'll need?
"Do you think you'll need  if you have t a team of four on, is that a half team or a six team?"
A half.
A four.
We did have  we worked a six team but it's not as easy to work out.
I'm only thinking that  you've got somebody counting?
Yeah.
There's one person counting?
Two.
Two people counting.
"No not yet, er only about France, and I told you about"
Oh I'm not sure
the
Oh dear
places you can go to
Mm
which is a fallacy
"I thought it was Barry  there, he looked a bit like him."
"No he's trying to get up, get down naughty boy."
"E T get down, down."
"Down there, there's a good boy"
"If you tell him sternly, he does understand the tone of your voice  if he goes off and sulks for a while, well so be it  you'll have to sulk till you get used to it, there you are."
"in the U K  mm, yeah, all looks very nice, camping"
Joking aren't you camping?
Well that's just what it looks like here  you just eating al fresco and going back up to the chateau at a night
Oh we're back in France again are we?
Mm
Yes
well
"Oh I see, yeah, yes it's"
Mm
"It's not a cheap holiday by the time we get, get down there your petrol"
Well for us I mean it's
and then the ferry across
it's not so bad for somebody living on the south coast
Yes
"but er, as you say erm, really it's such a long journey that you need a breather before you need to start to cross the channel"
Oh yes I think so  a good thing you're inviting Ken didn't I to come with us?
Yes I did mentioned it erm
Did you to Ken?
Well you were there weren't you too?
"I just mentioned it in passing and let the conversation carried on about something else so I, I don't know whether"
"Right, okay,my boudoir, I've just seen a few things  together."
"I should get changed, really, but I'll,"
No.
"what I'll do, is I'll  if I give you my clean shirt, you take it round to yours."
"If I want to change, I'll put it, the only thing is, if we do go up the bar, I think I'll be a bit warm, in something like this won't I?"
"Yeah, that's the trouble isn't it?"
But it's so cold out there.
"I know, it's a bloody, it's such a pain in the arse, because you freeze  to death, bloody getting up there, and then when you get in there, it's so bloody hot."
So start with  what the hell  which is really quite aggravating really.
Sorry?
"It's quite aggravating, innit?"
Mm.
"right, she did take that book with her, didn't she?"
Yeah.
Was she supposed to then?
"Right, lipstick, lipstick, lipstick."
lipstick on your collar    told a tale on you
really.
Oops
You need some more curtain hooks.
"No, I don't."
No.
Is that how many there were up there?
Yeah .
Or have they nicked some?
"They  they tended to spread them out a bit, about the house, you know, just willy-nilly, where they were wanted."
"They're just normal ones, aren't they?"
"Oh, I expect so."
"I know, does look a bit silly, doesn't it?"
"They shouldn't be  like that, we should, like, be able to pull cords and curtains as well gathering them a bit."
They are gathered even now.
"You probably can do in that, I just haven't mucked around with it."
"Right, does Saria had a form, she must cos you said she's booked, Peter have you g , Peter you've got forms have you?"
"Don't think she has got a form, no, Alma have you got any spare forms for that."
"No, I think I've distributed them all, didn't I?"
Mm.
We could get one from British Section couldn't we?
"You think, I thought you said she's booked, she hasn't booked."
"Oh no, she's definitely wants to go, but she hasn't actually filled out the form ."
"Well, she's, she's going to it ."
"Erm, yeah I think she said she'd get one directly."
Erm.
"I think er, I guess that any individual members would get them in their, erm journal."
Yes.
"I might, I might, yes, we, I, well, I'll, looks like it ."
"I'm an individual member, perhaps I've done, got round to opening the  ."
"I'm not sure, I'm not sure, they, they have been there  ."
That's possible .
.
Quite happy you know telephone them to send on
"Ah, right, well, we'll just check, yeah."
"Cos that's  when, when, when we get to that nearer the date, we could, we could just, you know, when you're confirmed that you've been booked and you're definitely going, erm we could look at the finances and see how much we could afford to, to give, erm, something to each person to help with,eit either with the accommodation or, or the transport."
Mm.
"Cos the accommodation is quite a bit, isn't it?"
"It's fifty , sixty or more, probably more this time."
No .
Seventy six pounds .
It's seventy six pounds .
Mm.
More of sixty five last year.
"Mm, yes."
Erm.
"That's nice, I'm, it's very good that people are going anyway, it's got"
That's for the whole weekend
But er I don't think we need to go to that er length with you.
"I've still got those erm, you know, the little purple tablets?"
Yeah.
"That dissolve in water,"
"Yeah, to soak them."
Mm.
"You could, you could go back on the Permitabs if you want."
"It's not desperately moist, although certainly one of them is cracking quite a bit, and if that helps to dry it up and make it more comfortable then it's worth giving them a soak ten minutes a day."
Mm.
"If you want to try those, you dissolve one in four litres of water which is er which is a little, just short"
just short of a gallo yeah you need a bowl.
"Yeah, but then you get the right concentration."
"If you use too high a concentration, it irritates and it stains even more than the dilute stuff does."
But that may be worth a go if you've got some Permitabs left.
Mm.
But I think we'll use some Dermavate Have you got plenty of Dipabase
Yeah.
Good.
"A big tub, yeah?"
Mm.
That's fine.
"Is it alright to put that on, you know, when it's broken?"
The skin
"Yes, you've got, you've got to be a bit careful with broken skin because if you put things directly on it, they tend to irritate."
"It won't do the skin any harm particularly, but it can smart."
And
Mhm.
that might be one good reason for using the er the soaks.
"The other think I'd recommend, is, using a fine pair scissors, is take off the scaly bits, the bits that stick out, cos they're the bits that catch"
Mm.
and hurt and
Yeah.
So the only ones that probably need to get made  are census stop if required etcetera.
So there's only three of those.
Yeah slow census and  whatever.
"So presumably if, if  Staffordshire have them made and we get those three whizzed up to Caernarvon  you know, the rest can sort of fit into place."
"Cos if you put survey instead of census at the bottom, I mean I know that's not strictly speaking how it should be, but they must have signs for us to survey because they have their own, presumably they have their own surveyors go out and"
Yeah.
Yeah like
you know and
you see yellow ones don't you?
On the motorway and stuff
Yeah.
they have survey on.
"But they very often, that triangular one with an exclamation mark, there'll be a little"
Yeah
plate on the bottom that says survey.
yeah.
"Well maybe it's not really right, but, but perhaps that  I'd have thought it would be alright."
Yeah.
"Census, it's probably the same in Welsh as well you know, don't you know?"
"Yeah, I see what you mean."
We might be able to get round it.
I'll see what this fella says.
"Well I mean I was saying to  this bloke well  can you think of anywhere where we might be able to, oh no no  no can't think of anywhere."
Well you could try Clwyd or something but   can't think everybody you know.
Clwyd might well do some.
I wonder
Oh it might be worth giving Nige a ring.
He's at Cheshire.
Oh yeah.
Who do we know at Clwyd?
Davydd .
Who?
And I was to show him what to do and I made sure that all .
On the first day I made sur I stayed with that man all day.
As I said I stayed with that man all day.
Although I wouldn't t in interfere with  show him how to do the job and  er I would make sure he understood the job.
If he asked me such and such I'd say now this is how you do it.
"If he said to me, after I'd shown him, that he understood it, I would say alright, show me how you do it."
And then that way the man learnt.
Mm.
The man himself learnt.
"And usually the man telling me he understood if eventually when he starts the job, he hasn't understood at all, he's just saying so, but I wanted to prove to the man himself that he could do it and prove to myself that he could do it."
So I was in a safe  and so was the man.
But
So you were given the responsibility then to train people up?
given the first in this .
Now then that were left on the
Did erm do you still keep up your union er membership right away when you were
"Oh yes, oh yes."
"Aye, yes ."
"In fact I were shop steward in the, in the building trade, I was a shop steward in the building trade."
Mm what did you go on to do after that?
After the business folded?
Was there anything like erm redundancy money or anything like that payed at that time when the place
Er
folded?
And can you remember what year it was?
Oh it's about
Just roughly.
"fifty, fifty seven I think."
It was somewhere thereabout.
Mhm.
And they didn't have all this er legislation about redundancy money or anything then?
No no.
And what happened say
They would never
were there ever occasions when there was one or more in your hay loft?
No no I don't think ever I can remember.
I th well I think er there was once or something but he he passed he didn't know that this er was so then they passed on.
Mm.
You see one stayed but he was there before him and the other one carried on.
No they would never they would never blend together.
Mm.
Like whiskies  blend .
No no they would never.
They were they were very very fine people.
And and the tinkers that came there.
Mhm.
Er wouldn't want to but from from  there was there was one lot.
And there were and the women folk would have their haberdashery and the men were tin smiths.
They would make pails and basins like you were being requiring in your sc er scullery or in the milk house as you would keep milk there.
So they were all and very industrious looking.
But they had for the winter time they their houses to go to.
Mm.
And they were just coming round in the summer.
Mm.
And their horses and my word they fairly looked after their animals mhm.
Did the crofting people have any special name for the the tinkers?
Not really no.
You've never heard the term summer walker?
Er er no no I could never say that.
Or mystery folk or?
Er well
Celts.
as the years came on they were beginning to get mystery fo folk but er not in my time.
Well that sort of people that was coming.
Because there's so many.
"She keeps on about all the time, every time I'm there."
Where you going now.
Whose house are you going to.
"It's almost like I'm a refugee  I felt right  I'm like, you know,"
"When you go home now, to which house?"
Where are you going.
"We were walk walking to erm the, down the high street and a plane went over, and erm, I think mum must have been saying to her about Aunty Jill being on holiday, and she went, ah, there's Aunty Jill in the plane going to the city."
It was really funny.
"I said, where did she get that from, my mum went oh I don't know."
"She went, yeah, my Aunty Jill's gone to the city, she's gone to a city."
"And then she said to me, and then, when I was going, she went to me, would you like to come on holiday, I went, then she went, because of me and mum and dad, we went another day to holiday, we went to beach, and er, mum said, that, yeah, mum said that she was saying, erm, to her, why, why is it not, what was it she said, about the weather, mum was moaning saying it was cold, and she went why, why aren't we go on holiday, mum, and mum said we can't, we can't afford to go on holiday, and she ah, why don't we go to seaside when it's cold."
"Mum says cos it costs lots of pennies, she went ah, another day, we'll go another day."
It's really funny.
She's got no concept of time.
"No, she hasn't  age, because she thinks she's  she's been a big girl, and she's now a little girl."
"That's right, yeah."
"She thinks she's  er, when I was like you, when I was a big girl,"
Yeah.
I did things like that.
Yeah.
Whereas not I will do things like that when I get older.
"Yeah, she thinks that she's been big already"
"Yeah, when I was, er she says when I was as big as Rebecca or when I was a big Joanna, it's always the name."
What did she say she did
"Just like,"
"got something on, or you got something."
Yeah.
Yeah.
I had one of them
Yeah.
when I was a big girl.
She is.
"She'll bite you, and our Whisky can"
"She scratched him outside, didn't she."
"And, if she were here three and a half minutes, that's all she were 'ere, and it and it 'em fifty quid."
Yeah.
Bloody ridiculous.
It's all a bloody money making racket.
"Another thing is, I'll tell why we don't want er, they always having valuations, they are, they come and value it, and then they give us money."
That means we're gonna be paying extra eleven thousand with money we ain't got.
Yeah.
That's another reason we're daren't send it off.
Yeah.
"Yeah, because if ya, if ya, get it before ya start your business."
You've still got it to pay as soon as you get it.
Yeah.
"Trust them, because it's in their  at the moment."
"Well, I still believe in  and I don't pushed around and say, no you can't have money, no you can't get insured, and so that means  others."
You haven't lost anything have ya?
"Well, just er disappointment, I suppose."
For what
"Well, yeah,"
"Then again, I mean, I"
There's always summat else you can go and do.
"You know that, doing that, fabricating, and things like that, you know like actual welding and that type of  Er, we wouldn't make as much money out of that as you probably would"
No.
"No, you'll be, you'll be stuck to it, all time, and it's not good for 'im."
No.
And it kills your eyes welding.
Benjy.
"But as he said to me, why don't you go  welding."
"I says, the point is I've got bad eyes as it is,"
Yeah.
so I said well why's that then Norren?
"I've got used to doing it now, you know?"
Yeah
Well she said she's got a lot of scrubs to do and all that business
Yeah
"so she said while you've been doing that she said she's been sort of gassing to anybody you know, so she said it's been mentioned by management and they said oh well she'll be able to sort of hovering while she stood there you know, time, time to natter she could be erm, got time to do that."
"yeah  so I said oh I see, so that was that, so I think they've got a, a meeting in a couple of weeks and they'll sort of tell her discreetly that she has to carry on and do it what she's been the"
"time sort of thing you know, so, said it's been noticed that like"
and all that you know?
Yeah
"But erm, you know, get"
it's got to be scrubbed more often so you know
Normally
that is the same thickness as what this I think  can you hold that dear?
I'm surprised Joy didn't say something about it yesterday actually Joanne
Perhaps she didn't have it
she done quite a bit of hovering really
"Oh that's good then, yeah"
Is it alright now?
"Well, yeah"
It'll only pop out I suppose won't it?
Well it have to pop out but it keeps popping back in again that's all that is
Sorry
"alright thank you, prefers than what you done last time"
"Yeah better than that, yeah"
How's your mouth then?
Alright
Where's the other lighter?
There in here
oh I see.
Where's Samuel
where's Samuel's?
Mm.
They were talking  pedestrianizing
"I think that's been on, on the cards for a long time hasn't it?"
Yeah.
Pedestrianizing and they've never done it.
Sorry!
Erm  Wh have we done anything about the environmental charter?
Because I  started doing it a long time ago
"Yeah, yeah Bob did that didn't he?"
It vaguely Yeah and we presented it and then it fizzled.
The group  fizzled out because we presented the charter.
And that was the aim of
It asks here have they adopted it?
Erm
wouldn't or we aim to still try.
Well  .
"I I think, I've a funny feeling that  did  adopt it but quite how much that means I don't understand."
"Well it's awful, having to do this  questionnaire we, we've done ."
All these workshops that have been going on that we haven't been to.
Well they just kind of recognized the principles don't they but they don't ensure that they'll actually put them into practise.
That's what adopting means  it's not actually committing .
"Yes I thought they had, yes."
How about these questions.
Does the group have a constitution?
No.
Does the group have an office?
No.
We've got our plastic box!
Plastic?
"I know I know everybody will be disappointed but I couldn't get  cardboard ones, stick it all in."
We bought the storage boxes anyway to keep all the .
No but you can't really I mean that's what  supposed to have it like an actual proper office.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Two two
It is.
"It's, it's sort of following the demise of part of er Trevor's empire."
Thus making it even cheaper.
For to a smaller an empire.
"I should use that word, that was used very loosely that word  cheap."
What?
Cheap?
I mean  I'm briefed
on that.
Mm.
Okay.
So the urgent work procedure has now been removed to make life easier.
D two
And to let the client know where the job lies within our organization.
Good.
Given a point of
"Straight into a function and that function head will then s write to the client saying, I've got it."
"My project coordinator is Mr X, and then we've got the point of contact established straight away."
"There are quite a few fairly minor changes to the appointment contract procedure but I haven't, I don't pretend, intend briefing those because I think most people can read."
Right.
"So they should be aware there, there are some."
Yeah.
Right?
Er J two stop zero.
Trainees training report file.
Yes.
"Erm there is a requirement that all trainees and new starters within the group, who are having training reviews undertaken, will maintain a training file."
So they know where to find and we know where to find all their bits of reports and the like.
So we got money coming in.
Mm.
our Karen.
"But er, I mean, I says, can't we manage without him, can't you manage by yourself, but Colin says he can't really, because"
He needs somebody.
Yeah.
"Well, Colin's gotta be able to do a lot of office work, he's gonna be out doing quotes, you know what I mean, so he's going have to have somebody there."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Or I would apply for er, family credit straight away."
"get coming in, I'm gonna say, yeah, we've got ten thousand pounds."
"But we don't know how long it'll be, before get any money coming in, and if you go on to family credit, you get it for six months, so that'll be our wages."
"So then, what what comes out of business we'll pay him anyway."
Yeah.
"You might have too much in bank for family credit, that ten thousand, it's only eight, innit?"
"It's got, it's gotta know what  increase, when you running a business."
Yeah.
"Oh, I don't know."
"If you apply for it straight away, could you say you don't know how much monies coming in."
How much money your gonna coming in.
"His dad's in a new business, anyway,bec so you should get forty quid a week at least, anyway."
"Thirty-five now,"
"Is it thirty-five,"
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
Yeah.
It's like everything else
"I mean, that's seventy pound, you wouldn't have had, anyway, ain't it."
No.
Oh.
"I ju I mean, it, now it's just getting me, more depressed than nowt else, I mean, I just wish that they'd phone and say yeah, we've got you a insured."
"And then, I mean, 'cos we daren't say that to accountant know, to have 'ouse valued, 'cos what's point in, I mean, anybody said to us, er, get it sent off, you'll find, you're, somebody will insure ya."
The other thing  I mean to be healthy  it's more important  to dry things and keep them dry for a while than to boil them.
Bacteria survive heat for a short time.
Yeah.
But they don't a for the percentage of bacteria that survives drought  is is minimal.
So you don't need to boil  logically.
"Er if you just keep your hankies  iron them, keep them dry."
"Then they are, then they are sterile."
be bothered.
"Anyway, back to the point."
He said pointedly.
Well  leaflet.
stall.
We've got to get back to the stall.
Yeah er the recycling leaflet.
Who's gonna do it?
It's not gonna be done if we don't get somebody to actually front you know
well
take it on
The  thing is that I  I can do  revamp it on computer.
Because it w you can scan
What ma manually?
No you just stick it on  a photocopier
I see I wa before you do that I'll get in touch with the guy who drew it and if he  if he has got  an original copy he might be able to erm to er
"What, what you can do is you can then get basically you get the computer to type that out  type that out."
Ah.
"And then you just do a run, you don't have to go on to print it at all you just print it off."
That's one option
Then photocopy the rest of it.
I've got a laser printer yeah so I mean that's what I use for my business.
I've got a Mackintosh and a laser printer.
So I mean
I've got some recycled paper but but
But he's such a dork I'm taking him off it.
And they're letting him keep linear.
Cos linear is just consignment stock and you know  job there.
"Sally  the lass who's taken over the buying for precision bearings, is a great lass got on great with her, and Richard."
"And they want to come and see the factory, they want to go to  yeah, it fell down cos Richard was too busy at the end of last year, fine get that sorted and i Sally was dropped in the crap by  right at the end of last year, came on  five sets of bearings, I could've done 'em in two weeks."
"I said I'll get you in two weeks, wallop wallop  It's alright,to do it, they have 'em back in a month."
"We're alright you know, they only way you'll get the business, he's like that, he talks like that, is if you can you know offer a big price saving."
That I'm afraid that's one thing you can't do
Alright.
even if it means that this year Yeah yeah.
Er
From my own point of view I want the business but bearing in mind what's happening I'm asking you before I do anything.
Erm I
Should I let the dust settle first?
Yes.
So I'll leave it.
E you either either leave it or
"If I quote three or four quid underneath, he'll consider it and we may get an order in a few months time when the schedule runs out."
Do you want me just to leave it?
"I think what you could sensibly say, to them, is, Look, I gather you've had supply problems with"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Cos I was there when it happened.
And s n a look you won't have supply problems with us.
Mhm.
"And you could say, look what we've done with ."
Yeah
Competitors of yours.
Yeah.
"Competitors of yours, wanted bearings in a week, we got 'em bearings in a"
The problem the problem is that's happened with the design people.
Yeah?
"It's a way of life, they've lived together that long, like, they don't want to"
"If when you and Pete had that trouble, if our Margaret had er been working, I honestly think she would have left Pete."
I know.
"But the only thing that our Margaret could come up with, was why should I, why should I leave me home and sell up, she said, when all my life, he's had money from the house."
"He'll have the money from the house, plus a wage every week."
"She said, and what will I have, she said, just the money from the house."
"She said, and where do I live."
"You know, he can move back home with his mum, she said, I suppose I can go back home to me mum, well then I've got to look for a job, you know."
Mm.
And I honestly think that was the only reason that she stopped for Pete.
Yes.
"Because, she's she, he he were gonna get a wage every week."
Yeah.
"You know, and she worked all them years, and then when she weren't working, she have no money coming in every week."
"Yeah, but she's got all the shares."
"She hasn't, she got rid of them all."
"Aye, not with Bl not with"
"Yeah, but you could see, you could see, that, I mean Pete were getting about hundred and twenty pound a week."
Yeah.
"We'll he had his money he won't have to touch, he could live on that hundred and twenty pound a week."
"Oh, aye,"
And he could start again.
Find another woman and buy another house and start again.
Mm.
"I mean like Jeremy and Kay, I mean, they're not happy."
"They pretend they are, but I mean like, he's he's"
"They've got to do, aren't they, I mean, after all bloody  harm they caused."
"Yeah, you know, you know how flaming miserable and mardy he is."
Yeah.
He's another one.
"But you see when he living with Ange, maybe he were younger then, but I mean like, when he were living with Ange, he had all the women as you know, plus he had Kay, plus he had, you know, Ange, he had everything, there was Kay,as well, weren't he, now he can't."
No.
It's been at the Playhouse in past years though.
"Oh, well maybe."
"No, it wasn't, wasn't at  last year was it?"
Was it?
Well last year I did it at Latton Bush .
"Well what, what's the date?."
The seventh.
The seventh of March.
"Erm, so that's going to be before our next meeting isn't it?"
"So erm, if anybody wants to help contact me  ."
"Yes, what time, how much is, how much the day is it all day?"
I haven't any details either than what she said .
No .
"Erm, shall we erm see, what shall we do about this, it's Saturday the seventh of March, on a Saturday"
As I say I'll take a stall and I'll be there all day if anyone can help me.
"Right , well perhaps I, perhaps people could as actually come and speak to me afterwards, if they, if they think they could help at all, that's International Women's Day and all the local organisations have been asked to take part"
"Certainly , it's, it's for your ."
It was quite good last year.
"Yes, and we could sell our products and that's sort of thing."
"Yeah our things ,."
And that's a good way of advertising our .
"Mm, right, we've got a list, ah, you probably know, there's a list, a list isn't there, of, of sort of sale products, have you had that at all?, thing that came with us, with your, with ."
No .
"Yes I got it, but you may not of had it."
"I will pass it on, I will pass it on to you."
"We, we sell quite a lot of Amnesty products, a lot, a lot of clothing in every"
on tonight.
Yeah.
"Tee-shirts and er sweat shirts and all sorts of things so we can take them along, so that's, that's Saturday the m , seventh of March, if you think you can help at all see Avriel afterwards."
have you got a date?
"Yeah, got a couple."
"Anything you  we got some of those things, tell me, I'll bring it along  ."
Yes.
I'm finding something totally wrong with   and got shot of it  and then things have been
"Well actually he didn't, but he says"
worse  thinking he'd been to solicitors  but I'm trying to track down anybody!
Just trying to get some information.
Apparently  oh my God tha they're that much within the law.
"Yeah, that's what we've been told."
"They must have a legal section cos this is one of the biggest organisations,leisure group in Britain"
Yeah.
for caravans.
"They, they, they,they own"
They're going to clear themselves aren't they?
You clear you!
More than that!
Apparently
They're not going to
"one man told me, he said"
"well if you think you might get some money at the end of the season, he said, you may find that you'll be paying them at the end of the season!"
"I mean, what's the good of it?"
"Yeah, you see!"
Well we may as well have got that money and thrown it down the toilet!
Gone straight in the bin!
Well that's right!
"Straight away this year, you get a list through  now, do you want winter cleaning done, curtains cleaned,"
Yeah.
"carpets cleaned, upholstery cleaned?"
"Or outside valet, do you want the underneath painted with grease and everything?"
I say we did have it done.
By the time you add all that up  if you're not local.
All your profit's gone!
You'll  you will end up paying them!
Yeah.
"Cos Mark's going in one, Sally's going in the other."
Oh bring them home then.
Bring them home and tell them that you're taking them home to air.
"And I don't suppose, they're not wet  you see."
"It's different  it's, they're damp  it's different if there'd been a hole and the water was coming in."
They're not saturated.
No.
It won't take them long.
That's what I says.
If those men wasn't working there I wouldn't hesitate.
The fire would go on and I'd leave it on low
Mm.
and the atmosphere would warm up  right through the caravan.
Mm.
But I'd hump them into the sitting room.
If those men came there on Tuesday
Mm.
"and done their work  and Mark rang me here and said, on Tuesday  the caravan's great now, the fires are alright."
I'd go straight over there and switch the fires on.
Mm.
Well I'd even tell him to go down only he ain't got the keys.
Cos they're not going to take an awful long time in a good hot room  to dry.
"the only thing again that I'm thinking of  what if we gets them out of the caravan  and we gets them into the car and we're getting them in and out here  and then we gets them back into the car to take them back over and in to the caravan, what if we rip the bloody things?"
Well if we rip them we rip them and I'll mend them.
Mm.
They are yours aren't they?
Mm.
Put a patch on them.
"Then she turned round and she said, I said to her those beds are soaking, I said."
There's nobody can sleep in those.
"Yes, she said but er when I went down there to check after you'd gone, she said  erm  yours was erm  the driest of them sort of thing."
Suppose they didn't bother with them.
Now we're gonna be  using acid  very very dilute acid.
Nevertheless we have to take proper precautions.
"So, if you would be so kind as to get into a position where you can see what I'm doing without being too close  it means that if we do splash any acid by accident er the likelihood of it causing any problems to anyone are minimal."
Have you come to  supervise Miss  's class?
As it happens it would seem that most of those children are out on an English trip.
Oh.
Perhaps you would like to go and do your own thing.
Perhaps you'd like to stick around and watch this happening because I remember you subbing once for an etching lesson.
Oh it's an etching lesson is it?
Yes can you remember?
Yes
Yesterday wasn't it?
And you thought well I'd better not
I'm not having them running around .
That's right.
I remember you saying.
So perhaps you'd like to  keep them right
Have a .
and make sure I do it right.
But on the other hand if you
I don't know how to do it .
Oh well I meant from the point of view of .
Safe safety point of view.
Safety
Oh I'll stay for this.
Is that alright?
Mm.
Smashing.
Thank you very much.
This by the way is er Donald who is making sound recordings of  in the school today.
. So  swearing.
Er  right my friends.
"Like, we go into the loo and like, you can mend it."
Mm.
"So of course I've thought oh yeah that's all, okay, I thought, cos like, some of them have got the loop actually on the, the like on the top of the cup haven't they?"
Mm.
Did this one?
No!
The loop's attached to the end of the strap!
"It's a bit of the cup that's actually come apart, unsewn!"
"So that meant I had to get  the part of the, the top bit of the cup, thread it through the hoo , the hoop and then tie it in a knot!"
"So like, you can imagine  I had to have all the strap completely undone  so like  the, the buckle was like down here!"
And above the knot!
Comfortable then?
"Well  it wasn't, it wasn't that bad but like  it was really weird because like  you could see like, people like, especially the lads, just sort of looking at you  and then like  not meaning to be pervy but just like, looking again as if to think  why has Emma got a, a extraordinary lump  on half the top of her boob, you know !"
It's like a lump there!
"They're thinking, mm, a shame !"
"But like, it was alright then because like  means that you can changed up in this one corner of the changing room all the time  and so  I'd got my shirt on while I was putting my T-shirt on  like  for the reason that my bra strap was bust, not actually because I'd got a gigantic  love bite around my neck !"
But like er
But I mean
So that was alright really.
"But, I couldn't believe it cos I  he goes to me, what do you think of love bites?"
"And I goes, I think they're horrible to be quite honest, I don't"
Yeah.
like them!
Same as me!
"I goes to Scott, I really really  hate love bites   and er  and he goes, yeah and me."
"The only time he's ever had one was at this kid's party  Fran , Franny someone, he's  actually a bloke !"
Ooh that's
"I said that's   he went to this party and he he was like really hard and he was really drunk  and he gave  Scott, Noel and Ian  a love bite  like  for a joke !"
He just decided to do  just for a laugh!
"Oh, how sick!"
Ah what a gay !
"I know like, anyway  but like, Scott had gone home  said to his mum  like, is his mum isn't, going what's that on your neck?"
"I don't want any more s in instances where the quantity surveyor thinks he's got a certain fee that he's working to, only to find out later"
Hear hear.
on that somebody's knocked it down by half and not told him.
"Because that causes all sorts of problems on the  report and, and bad blood all round."
Course it did
It's not what team work's
"I mean I, no."
"I would reiterate that my objective is a very simple one, and that is to give the client the most cost-effective service we can."
"Er with this instruction, it will get picked up on the quality"
Co in accordance
er check list.
Good.
Good.
"Could I could I, could I ask that B E S be taken off the distribution codes."
We do not use quantity surveyors for that purpose and indeed the quantity surveyor is not geared up to do any measurement for us.
So you want that
The answer to that is
rewriting then?
No.
Because I think that there should be no reason why the Q S shouldn't provide you with that service in the same way as he provides anybody else Jim.
Unless there's
"But he's, but he's not geared up to do it."
But you've got erm a  Q S then.
We have.
I'm not too sure that means  .
"Well I think, I think  bloody robots"
we all were.
in there like.
electrical  away isn't it?
Mis yeah.
Mister Metal.
That's wound the buggers up.
X is going to go up when Y is a million.
X X is a million.
X is a million.
"What, what would Y be?"
A million squared.
Yeah.
"So th the minus one doesn't make a lot of difference, so as X is very, when X gets very big, it'll just look like Y equals X squared,taking one off if"
Mm.
you're working with millions of millions.
"So it looks like Y equals X squared, moved up a bit, more or less, as a good approximation."
"I mean a hundred is probably big enough, twenty five might be  is more or less big enough."
Mm.
"Er five, say we can have five here, you can have twenty five,over here somewhere,"
Mhm.
behind your shoulder.
"Yeah it'll actually be twenty five minus one,"
Minus one.
but it's a good enough approximation just to see what it'll look like.
So how do you work out the gradient?
"Well you see, it's pretty flattish isn't it?"
"The gradient of a curve is the gradient of tangent, so we can draw a tangent where you wanted it at that place."
It would be the gradient of the tangent.
Mhm.
"If it was at the bottom where it's flat, where you just, you're just coming down, and then you started to go up again, just at the bottom there, it's, it's zero for"
a moment.
"But what would the gradient be there, and how would we find it?"
Er
"It would, it, up here."
"So could you do an approximation, a ver just a very rough guess."
"I mean does it, does it lie over that way or has it sort of gone back on itself?"
Lies over that way?
Yeah.
How many people have said that they're going so far?
Well er me and Steve and Mark and you you're going
Yeah.
too aren't you?
So that's four of us definitely going to.
Erm Alison  says she'd like to but her you know it depends on this that and the other.
Yeah.
I I'm definitely going to  I picked this up from the information places.
It's got all a list of all sort of bed and breakfasts and
Oh.
holiday flats and things.
And the holiday flats in here are quite expensive.
But bed and breakfast are all very cheap.
Erm you know.
Where whereabouts is this is it?
I don't know she didn't say.
Didn't that's one thing I don't know .
Cos if it's two or three miles away it's gonna be a bit of a problem.
Yes that's right.
Erm I I need to check that.
How how much erm are the B and Bs?
Well quite cheap.
I mean about ten pound is the cheapest and perhaps even twelve .
The the extra advantage of the of the house would be cooking which we may get.
Because if if people took advantage of the of these facilities it would make the whole business an awful lot cheaper for them.
And if there's four of us there definitely then that's we only each have to cook once while we're there.
Yeah.
to get out of conference  to go to cook.
If it's close.
Yeah.
If fact it's it's I found it in the past to be a welcome very welcome break from the atmosphere because you can't hang around in in the dining hall without talking a Green Party.
As I remember it conference tends to run through until  new clients so.
Yeah.
And also for doing the programme.
Yeah?
"And you want a task schedule for organizing  this, it's a bit unspecific isn't it?"
Yeah.
Okay.
Erm  how is that then?
Er you happy to leave things as they are for the minute?
Carry on on that basis?
"Yeah, the only other thing like when you were saying about site layouts, if there's any maps  that we need, and that's including maps for coding, wall maps, you know, large scale."
Well obviously we've got to progress into that.
We need to prepare some  zone plans and gazetteers maybe.
Yeah.
"Erm  oh well I'll er the other thing I was thinking of is that er  we could be looking er  towards beginning, you know even now, to doing a trips network and things like that."
"There's no real reason why  you, say, shouldn't start to build up the data on that."
Yeah.
"Erm  y y you know you, you could do a diagram and presumably the person to speak to would be Billy or maybe Peter cos I think Peter did the bulk of the work."
Okay.
"Beverley did a lot of the actual sort of dogsbody work, you know, the actual doing of it."
Erm  so you need to build up a picture of what you've got  erm  but there's no real reason why we shouldn't be working on that now it seems to me.
Er in principle.
"Yes beginning, you know, we, we know what we're trying to do obviously we don't necessarily know every, every node in the network  erm  Cos obviously once you start doing that, or when we start doing tr the, the journey run  things erm we're going to need to know what we're wanting."
So there'll be two sides of it c er
"Well there, there won't be any  will there?"
Erm
Mm.
But anyway I mean it's all part of the picture.
"What I'm getting at is there's no reason why we need, we should wait until after the surveys to start looking at trips."
Which is what happened on Ormskirk.
Mind you it was partly because we didn't get a programme.
"But there's no reason, and on  as well."
Alright?
That's what I mean.
Just say no and if he  again say no.
when I come out .
"When I , but he won't  I put them all out, in fact ."
.
Ah  oh.
Go on.
No I won't  cos the police were at the car  no  .
Sounds like it were a robbery.
"come out again  police come out of the ca er er they were at the car there  oh I said that's my car, he said oh yeah, I said yeah, he said, what's your name?"
felt like it.
"checked with his radio, he goes alright then  phoned back to the police station on his  radio, he said it's not stolen the owner's now here  he said, can you please get it moved?"
"I said well I'm trying to  I said this bloke what happens to be my oldest brother I said, and he won't even tow it for me!"
"So he said, oh why not?"
"Steven thinks that just be I only just got in he said, I'm having my tea  and he said there's no way I'm gonna do nothing like that at this time of night when I've been fourteen hours at work  So then he stormed off back home again  so he said well you'll have to move it cos it's obstructing the dual carriageway  someone might come round that corner fast and hit it."
"He said it's not an offence he said if you've broke down, you can't help, he said  but you've gotta really move it  so I went round to Paul  and  there was about seven or eight blokes that pushed it all the way round to Bernie's."
No you don't forget Helen  he could come down
I don't forget things like that.
"and ask for any help in doing his car  don't go to work  or can he borrow this, just say  no I'm sorry  you couldn't help us  and I'm your sister  so now I can't"
I know
help you.
He has been like that for  since he's been with her  he has
I know about it.
"He used to help us with anything  before he got with her  he'd always help me  he always looked happy, now he"
Mum mum mum !
"But now he's with her, he don't wanna now."
"Well, you can just do the same with him."
I
You're not that bothered are you?
Well no  but I like to think that Steven's still my brother.
Yeah well I  my son but he don't treat a mother.
But he's not he's not that when he's with her.
Mm.
If you see what I mean.
Yeah.
Well so you think actually send something through to reprographics  for them to do in Liverpool?
Well you don't want to be doing it on the machine down here do you?
No.
"And if you got three thousand interviews, say a thousand at, well y you probably wouldn't, you'd probably get"
Probably two of those boxes would do wouldn't it?
"you could get  nearly four thousand interviews couldn't you, altogether?"
Yeah.
At two on a page is two thousand sheets  plus however many you'd only get one on.
So I'd have thought three thousand wasn't  out of the way really.
And like you say if there's some left they won't go to waste anyway.
No.
"Oh on the other hand I suppose we could say well we'll use, we'll get some and if we run out we'll use English ones."
"If you do it that way, you know, by the time they get there they should know what the questions are shouldn't they?"
Yeah.
"Excuse me, by the time you run a"
Cos we hold the original  to that.
To the interview
Well we'll need some  anyway.
Yeah.
"We've probably, I mean we, we hold the original on an A three  so it might be worthwhile  doing a  copy of it."
Doctoring it
Oh I see yeah.
to insert the Welsh because John will have to send the original off for
Oh right.
Yes .
We'll have a look
And then we can have the base copy of each then couldn't we?
Good.
"I'll, I'll dig it out after."
"And we just, he knew a lot of the, he was interested in si singing and he just knew the words and and just sang round about the house."
Mhm.
And he just sang too.
You know that's how he he learnt.
So what were his favourite songs?
"Oh dear, he was  what would you say, I don't know  He liked the kind of  ballads, er he was a more a kind of bay he liked a ballad, so I really couldn't tell you who was his favourite singer or anything like that, just if a song interested him he just"
What do you mean by ballad kind of songs?
"Well more the slow, er songs, not the fast."
The love songs and things like that ?
Things like that.
Mhm.
"but I I never sang anywhere, I just sang round the house as well."
Mhm.
And it was really er I think it was really the pantomimes that I started singing
Was it?
"here, oh yes."
I never I never went out
Were you were you in the drama clubs here when you were younger then as well?
"I was in the  Drama Club when I was when I stayed at home, but we didn't do pantomimes, we we did plays, one act plays, and three act plays, we did three act plays."
We never did pantomimes.
"And er  but that's the only time, you sang at weddings."
"So I said, Come on Mabel, sing."
Or my father would sing
So how long did you live in  for?
"We've , into the village, we lived out in the countryside till I was eight, and we come down into the I should say town shouldn't I, we come down into the town when I was eight and I was there till I was twenty two, and I came up here, when I got married."
"Mhm, is Leslie from this part of the country?"
"Les is from  oh well he was, I think he was three when he came up here."
"He lived in, he was born in Castle Douglas."
Mhm.
But I think he was three when his father was sh came up here to work.
What did his father do when he came here?
"Electrician, you know he still worked for the the electricity board ."
can!
The sheep to cross the road and
Mm.
quite unusual!
I'd never seen it before and that's the one time I've seen it.
"I can remember when you'd see  a cloud of dust, perhaps it'll be a mile away  and this would be  a flock of sheep."
"Course, they hadn't had  lorries in them days, they drive them on the road  and you see old shepherd coming along with a couple of dogs  and goodness knows how many sheep!"
"And of course, the roads were all gravel then, no tarmac, see this cloud of dust across there."
"And er  if you see it was coming towards  of course you run into them, but if they were going the other way  course the dust still keep going."
But  but of course this was many years ago.
Never see a flock of sheep on the road now.
It's all done with cars.
You wouldn't like this dairy you wouldn't.
It er  oh!
"It used to be  occasional or more perhaps, sometimes show time  different shows and that."
"So many sheep  or, ha  show time see, you see these flocks of shop  but now you always"
Been to a cattle market.
That's a long time ago because se the roads have been tarmacked for goodness knows how long now!
I can remember when the first bit of tarmac was put on a road round here  and that down here at Upton bypass  and all
Oh yes!
what they call Upton bypass.
Yeah.
Oh it was er  cry over war wound!
Oh!
Horses will never be able to stand on it!
It's slippery and that.
What a state they were in then!
"My father had er, horses at that time and  my uncle out at Holt, he had some horses  they were talking about this one day and  uncles would say  well a horse didn't work nearly as hard with that  road's were nice and solid."
"Father said well it's, it's so slippery they can't stand on them."
"But it wasn't, it wasn't slippery see, but they thought it would be."
Yeah.
An oh!
I never did like those open topped buses.
Well unclear
So I'll be back to you.
at the moment I can see about half well a dozen people sat on one of the buses.
Can you?
Yes.
No wonder there's no traffic moving out there today.
"There is traffic moving, it's moving quite freely apart from the cars going into the car park just behind Clifford's Tower."
Is that right?
That's right yeah.
There's never any spaces behind Clifford's Tower so I don't know how you're just telling me fibs aren't you?
Well they're all they're all queuing up to go in there so I not sure.
I just don't understand all these buses with the open tops it's freezing out there and all these tourists look they could walk Rachael.
Well are tourists
"They could walk, why don't they walk?"
It's a seven kilometre tour.
It takes an hour and a lot of people don't want to walk around the city they'd like the option of going around on the bus.
What did the Minister of Health say the other day?
Obesity obesity and lack of exercise.
and that's what you're encouraging Rachael .
Not encouraging lack of exercise we're encouraging an informative tour around the city with a qualified guide.
You still got that beautiful blonde hair?
We're not on the air are we?
No no no we're not on the air.
Heaven forbid I wouldn't talk to you like this if we were on the air  would I ?
Anyway so go on.
Right.
What were we talking about?
So you don't mind
Talking about the buses.
Yeah.
"So I mean I think it'd great Guide Friday you run around little flag in the air, I've seen them in London and you can do that and and and people get so fit."
That right?
They say unless you've been unemployed six months you're not unemployed.
You're looking for a job.
They don't call it unemployed.
Well you can't go on the list for six weeks anyway.
Six months.
"six weeks, yeah."
"Well if you haven't been working for six months you are looking for a job, you are not unemployed."
They don't call that unemployment.
Course this is all  voting   propaganda again.
I mean when is it  it's a disgrace to the social service workers isn't it?
To make them wear uniform.
They're getting them like prison officers and policeman and
Well it's the same as anywhere else.
If you work in Marks and Spencers you wear er their uniform.
If you work in the hospital you wear their uniform.
Yeah.
That's only to advertise the place though isn't it?
Marks and Spencers and
It isn't.
If you went into your Clarke's shoe shop they've all got the same clothes.
"It's it makes it so easy that  the staff, one can't dress any better than the other."
They're all equal.
When you go to places like  in the big stores  the staff have all got the same type of apron er overall.
"And that's for the customer, if it needs help they know who is who to go for advice."
Yeah.
That's all it is.
But when you've got people stood behind a desk and serving you and doing nothing but serving you as you come.
They'll be wanting bank clerks to have uniforms next.
Good god bank clerks have been wearing uniforms for these last three four five years.
Oh I've never seen them.
Well
That's the only way.
"Our cat, and I've really watched her  makes a point of going and walking slowly in the road."
And I think that is exactly what we have to do as cyclists.
Not squeeze to the side because they might not see you there.
right
"Well you sh you're supposed to ride a fair way out from the gutter, never in the gutter so they can see you round the bends."
Yeah but
And they often hoot you if you're doing it but that's the place
That is their fault if they hoot.
Erm especially going up that hill at Hockerill lights.
They overtake you  and then they slow right down so that you have to go oohooh and stop.
You can't cycle that slowly up a hill can you?
"They come in too quickly on, once they've passed you"
They don't they're in like that aren't they straight in front of you.
frightens me .
cycle underneath a car today .
Oh dear.
Michael  's got  helmet.
That's a good idea.
Yes  idiot wearing it though.
If everybody looks like him!
Oh well.
I mean it looks alright if you've got all the gear on  you know cycling shorts and top and everything
make them like swimming hats with lots of little flowers all over them
Yeah.
But if you do get one you have to be careful you get one that's done to the proper standard because some don't work apparently.
absolutely nothing.
Well that's what I thought it just seemed to say they were gonna have sort of cycle ways going through the green wedges along  where I cycle already.
Mm.
And that's no help at all is it.
we can't complain.
That should do quite well in trying to get the traffic away from the centre in Stortford anyway.
Well wonderfully cool.
They would they would watch where they would where they would excavate this thing out
Mm.
from.
But yes it was wonderfully cool.
Mm.
And the produce was salmon ?
And the prod it was it was sort of kept as within a reason of time of course it wouldn't.
But er and of course stuff was salted.
Venison
Venison of course.
you you buy er salt it away in barrels in boxes and and work on it until it was through.
Now was that your father's own particular task the the salting of the venison?
Oh oh oh n no really I can't say that.
Er we only probably did it when ourselves we got venison beforehand on the last shooting and to keep.
But no no er there was so many hinds having to be shot in the winter time and and and it would be sent away you see.
But not away what they're doing now or but it'd be sent down to their premises down in the in the shooting lodges in the south.
Mm.
And that  and to their friends.
And there would be always a beast or two cut up for to be given to the village.
Mm.
Oh yes that was one thing.
I always remember that.
So where did the venison actually go to?
Well it well ah but ah but they never they never killed it in that quantity as they're doing it now.
Mm.
To make money.
No no there was no money made of it.
It was just for their for their own use.
Mm.
And haunches of venison that was the best part in the  they would be sent away to themselves  the haunches.
But the other parts with the ribs and all that'd be cut up given to the and the lodge itself for the.
Right.
Let's list the tasks of a receptionist.
"Shout now, go on,let let's go for it."
"Telephone, answering it"
"And  telephone, answer."
That's what you think they do.
"Er, you're right, erm I can't think of the right word er"
Re-route.
"Re-route, same thing as what you meant isn't it?"
"Diverts, if I wrote divert up here you might use it against me in later life."
"Erm er route, let's just call it route er to  correct   yeah?"
"Does that make sense, that's for the receptionist we don't expect her to fiddle with the rates for liability, capital or whatever do we?"
Anything else a receptionist does?
Okay?
"Okay, so it's erm  meet  public yeah?"
We need to
Right fair enough.
well I did do stat view in the first year but not very much
Yeah.
"No, no I"
how to use it.
"find stat view very difficult to use myself but er when the time comes, once you've got a few that are filled in we can erm  well I'll show you how to do an S P S S data file and, and erm so you can bash your data in and if you bring it back we can turn it into a system file and analyze it."
Erm so er  that shouldn't be too bad.
"So I don't know do you, do you fancy now kind of giving the different versions to a few people by way of er er"
Yeah.
"another pilot and, and see if erm"
Well I'll just do it in my flat I suppose
Yeah.
"Yeah fair enough if, if that's erm you know how you fancy starting."
And then if you
finish it off.
"any, any sort of, yeah, any sort of changes or anything erm  er  I don't know if you're around sort of early next week we can"
Not really.
So long as we're talking about sort of half a mile away ma maximum or with other sort of proper travelling arrangements.
If it's half less than half a mile away then it's it's fine but if not it starts to becoming problematical.
The other thing about financing it.
So I haven't done the sums in my head.
How much is it actually to get a  place?
Well if it's six pounds for six people that's thirty six pounds a night isn't it?
For four nights
Plus three
Plus a bit.
So it's about forty quid a night and there's Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday.
It's four nights.
So that's  that sounds quite a lot to ask the political party
Oh I wouldn't ask them to pay
Yeah.
That would be too much.
But it's one way of distributing any money that the party wants to give to subsidize people so that everybody can benefit from it erm rather than means testing.
I'm happy as long as we we get the definite six people definite.
We I think you know we can do go into just four four people .
I I'm quite happy to come in on it.
I think I probably would like a single room though.
Are there two single rooms?
Two single and two double.
Yeah well on a first come first serve  basis a single room I'd come in on it .
Well strangely enough I think we'll have to have double rooms .
Well if if we do only get four people it's going to be more isn't it?
Yeah.
It's going to be ten pounds a night each
Yes erm.
roughly and you don't get breakfast thrown in.
No that's right.
I I would hope to be able to  party conference probably only  which would mean turning up either Friday night or Saturday morning.
Yeah.
"Cos  that really got up, up my back when the , I mean tho ain't a ba , bad bunch of old boys but  I normally go down  but they they clear and once we've done our work  before dinner break they all clear off  and I go down to the   and then I sort of walk back  more or less behind them  you know, to the  break like  and as I go past the club, I go and wash my hands, they go straight in, I go and wash my hands and I walk past the   and er  we should go to dinner at quarter to twelve  and I go past, it's one minute past quarter to twelve  so cos when we go in there you see  quarter past twelve  due to go back  I always give them two or three minutes  and I say that's it, that's , ah we was late coming in, I said no you weren't!"
"We was  I said look  I can read a bloody clock as well you can, I said I wa walking behind you down the , you went in the canteen and when I went past it was one minute past quarter to!"
"So I said you know, the  one minute past quarter to  and there's a sort of quietly  you know  but then you know, just have to grab at"
Yeah.
they get excitement out of taking two extra minutes
"Give them an, inch and they want a yard"
I think oh my God!
"You know, I, it's so petty that!"
"That's like Sarah  at work, I mean  she leaves at twenty past five, if she thinks that, she'll leave at ten past five  I mean she thinks you're stupid because she don't always go  but even when she's not going  she"
Yeah.
still goes at twenty past five  so why don't she go at six when we do?
Yeah.
You know.
Yeah.
And she said she even
taking her home Sarah!
I told her I wouldn't.
"Yeah  cos she used to get me t , and then she rang me up one day when I was  and said  dad erm  dad can't bring me round there cos the car's not working, can you come and pick me up?"
Yeah  .
"She said I'll give you some petrol money, I said I'm not bothered about petrol money, I said it's the fact that I've gotta come round to pick you up, I said I'm not a taxi!"
Yeah.
"And then  I was late, when I got round there I thought well she'll at least be waiting at the top of the drive, if not at the top of the road."
Yeah.
"She weren't there, I had to go round the house knocking on her door and oh"
Yeah.
I was mad!
Yeah.
Well yeah you don't mind giving anybody a lift
No.
if they make their way to you.
"Yeah  and she used to be hammering on the door, twenty past five  you know  yeah"
"Oh yeah, Jean told me"
"she said no , Jean said oh I can't walk that, have a bloody heart attack she says, so they put her in a trolley"
"they put her in a bloody trolley and oh course she said, this woman said erm"
said she might be small she said but she ain't half put on some weight you know
Oh yeah
you know?
Yeah
"So I said well I don't, I don't look at her and I sort of see"
she said yeah she said sorted that out and put her in a trolley
Yeah but she had to walk back that way didn't she?
Did she?
"Yeah she went to, she went to the shops and got one of those trolleys, she said what for?"
"She said I want to go to Minehead now, what she said it's only just up there, yeah I know but I've, I've bloody got to climb down there and bloody try and get back she says, er"
"well it's not that she, it was affecting the drink she had you know"
Oh I see
"she said the drink, the drinks are quite expensive down there"
"Yeah, I'm glad they took their, took their own"
"Yeah cos what, what they said like, their own, cos they run out of wine at the bar  and er, they went in the supermarket and got two bottles of wine and kept them on the table you see"
Oh
"so, they said"
what was it?
"The wine that have in the bog, is that a cheap wine?"
Yeah
"Well they ran it like that cos they said at the bar we can sell you a bottle of wine for seven pound fifty though, so he said you bugger off he said that, went down the supermarket and get our own like"
Oh
"and of course the bloke that were drinking that he kept, then they buy a"
bottle and erm they used to queue at the table that for the
you know
Oh yeah
used to just keep topping that you know
I thought they'd be more into spirits than wine
"Well there were spirits weren't there, vodka and all that, you know, no I suppose one or two drunk the old wine you know"
General essays can turn into just regurgitating from the .
Okay so is there anything you've read that you all would want to concentrate on?
Erm Well not that I've come across yet  I'd rather do something that's  getting the facts and then giving examples.
Mhm.
I want top do something on what what you noticed about  and what you've got
Right.
Right.
Er let me think.
"I'll just go and find out when the due date for this essay is, and then Cos if it is the end of week three then I'll I'll say o I'll say it can be in in week four sometime."
"But if it's due in when the project originally was which was week five, then that"
"gives you a bit more time to decide exactly what you want to talk about cos if  if it has go to be in week three or week four, then we really sort of like decide now what you're going to write about so that n Cos next week is gonna be our last meeting on this topic, so you really want to sort of give a bit of a presentation on what you're going to say."
Yeah I want everyone to do like five or ten minutes next week on what they're gonna write.
Okay I 'll just go and find out.
What are they supposed to be doing by the way?
What happens to the like project?
It got cancelled .
Cancelled
It got cancelled?
"Oh right, didn't hear that then."
"There  Oh that's why we're not doing it any more, so what do we have to do instead of having to do an essay ?"
Just an essay.
"Oh, they decided not to give us quite so much work?"
Mm.
Oh right.
So we Is that why the
"Is that what we're meant to be doing this term,tutorials?"
Think so I don't
When do our tutorials stop?
I'm really confused.
We've got two more tutorials?
"What Oh yeah, week three and week four, and"
Yeah.
Where they'd come from?
On some cases yes because I was always told this man he that used to come and he was so clean looking and that he was a barber.
Well that er er er an Englishman that he was trained as a hairdresser.
As a man's hairdresser.
But somebody er whatever he no he didn't carry anything to to do that no.
But that's what he's he told you?
Oh yes but he told somebody that he was a hairdresser.
And you would see that they were very some of them intellectual people.
Mm.
Too and who knows how they went to the road.
Mm.
Did they fail in their exams or something or went to drink or.
It's said nowadays about drink but I don't know.
They they were quite er learned men they weren't numskulls you know.
Mm.
So something just peculiar at that very time put them to the.
Did they ever do any form of casual work?
S some of them did yes if they came in the springtime and then in the ar in in the harvest time.
Yes oh some would w w work but some wouldn't.
Er and if if they would work they didn't want money for it but they would stay a while with you so that they would get their bed for the night and they would get their grub.
Mm.
What type of work did they  ?
Well they would take in er er er they would er er and they would put hoe potatoes you see when that was coming on that time.
And they would help to lift potatoes and they would er stack corn and hay.
Oh yes and that's those only that would do it but you wouldn't get the ordinary man taking any he would just be on his rounds.
And you wouldn't say oh I think it's going to be wet today John you better stay.
Not him his his mind was made up on going and that was it.
And were you visited by the peddler the pack-man character
Yes.
who sold goods
Oh oh yes er er who who sold.
Er there was one chappie that  er erm I can remember of him and he had a suitcase and well he had a shaving soap I suppose cos people used soap then with your shaving brush and and that and proper shaving brush and razor blades probably that quite.
"Mm and then you thought, Oh God I've done it now ."
But I had to speak to you you see and I dialled you while you actually said on the air that anyone that won had to speak to you and said to Karen look if you ring back I'll  put the answer phone on .
I know I thought that was good because then everybody puts the phone down you see and they all think they're going to be terribly clever.
Yes I think it depends on what kind of a message you actually have on your recorder to start off with.
Is your's rude.
No it just says that it's basically to the effect of that the answering machine is quite reliable
I  I
"and if you leave a message it will be dealt with and people do leave a message, whereas before when it just said I'm sorry I'm not available they didn't they just put the phone down."
I usually leave a message saying I'm having sex at the moment ring back in about three seconds.
And do they?
Sometimes sometimes they never ring back at all ever.
I should've just say you're bragging.
"Yes you're right, you been speaking to my wife?"
Well yeah we'll probably use the same supermarket I don't know.
So listen I wan er er so is there any snow out there at all anywhere?
No no hon
There's not.
Any chips out there ?
Well to be honest Ja I can't see that far normally from where I live I can see the White Horse bank but it's shrouded in mist at the moment erm no I can't see so I couldn't tell you whether there there is snow up there or not.
Okay.
I also I I also erm er what was I going to say I would take the disc but I can't find a way of getting into this machine actually it's broken erm .
It sounds about par for the B B C.
"Young Danny, the big boss now weekend said er take a disc take a disc and I said yeah well  it's knackered er erm."
What?
Sorry.
I'm doing that talking to you look for Jim Bowen's mobile phone number so I thought we'd give him a ring that'll surprise him wont it?
Yeah.
Okay er
Can the B B C afford these phone calls?
I don't think so no I don't think so at all that's why they don't call anybody back.
Oh well you can call me back.
Erm oh hang on just a minute can you hang on there?
Well after after the big box pile up I'm I'm free on the Green Party.
And then the elections and then get our act together.
I don't think we need to be too sorry at the reason we're not getting it written is we're far too busy lobbying MPs and making protests in the centre of town and things.
So it's probably good rather
On balance.
Right.
Any other business?
I've got a couple of things.
Do we have nominations for conference reps and local election candidates?
Because these will need to go in the selection ballot in the newsletter what I am going to write.
Oh er you mean from people here?
Well
Yes?
Or I mean the flood of phone calls that have no doubt saved the erm Green Party .
Oh I'd I'd like to be a a delegate at conference but I can't be a candidate this year cos I'm captain of my and I think I'll be a bit busy anyway to be honest doing press work.
It would be nice to have a break from doing it.
Right.
Anybody wish to be put forward as conference attender?
The number is unlimited is it?
Yeah.
Yeah.
We have three voting certificates but you can pass them around
It's a shared job.
Yeah.
Oh might as well then.
You just have to be approved by the  that's all.
Yeah I'll do that thing.
Right so that's got three so far and
I mean I think if you're not sure whether you want whether you'll be able to go  I mean you can still you can still be a  delegate then if you do go then you're able to vote so.
So you'd like to be put down on the ballot to be approved do you?
Doesn't mean you have to go.
Just means that if you do go you
Susan wandered by with a hoe in her hand and her second best bonnet on her head .
`` I have just finished reading a piece in the Enterprise which told of a couple being married in an aeroplane .
"Do you think it would be legal , doctor dear ? ''"
she inquired anxiously .
"`` I think so , '' said the doctor gravely ."
"`` Well , '' said Susan dubiously , `` it seems to me that a wedding is too solemn for anything so giddy as an aeroplane ."
But nothing is the same as it used to be .
"Well , it is half an hour yet before prayer-meeting time , so I am going around to the kitchen garden to have a little evening hate with the weeds ."
But all the time I am strafing them I will be thinking about this new worry in the Trentino .
"I do not like this Austrian caper , Mrs. Dr. dear . ''"
"`` Nor I , '' said Mrs. Blythe ruefully ."
`` All the forenoon I preserved rhubarb with my hands and waited for the war news with my soul .
When it came I shrivelled .
"Well , I suppose I must go and get ready for the prayer-meeting , too . ''"
"Every village has its own little unwritten history , handed down from lip to lip through the generations , of tragic , comic , and dramatic events ."
"They are told at weddings and festivals , and rehearsed around winter firesides ."
And in these oral annals of Glen St. Mary the tale of the union prayer-meeting held that night in the Methodist Church was destined to fill an imperishable place .
The union prayer-meeting was Mr. Arnold 's idea .
"The county battalion , which had been training all winter in Charlottetown , was to leave shortly for overseas ."
"The Four Winds Harbour boys belonging to it from the Glen and over-harbour and Harbour Head and Upper Glen were all home on their last leave , and Mr. Arnold thought , properly enough , that it would be a fitting thing to hold a union prayer-meeting for them before they went away ."
"Mr. Meredith having agreed , the meeting was announced to be held in the Methodist Church ."
"Glen prayer-meetings were not apt to be too well attended , but on this particular evening the Methodist Church was crowded ."
Everybody who could go was there .
Even Miss Cornelia came -- and it was the first time in her life that Miss Cornelia had ever set foot inside a Methodist Church .
It took no less than a world conflict to bring that about .
"`` I used to hate Methodists , '' said Miss Cornelia calmly , when her husband expressed surprise over her going , `` but I do n't hate them now ."
There is no sense in hating Methodists when there is a Kaiser or a Hindenburg in the world . ''
So Miss Cornelia went .
Norman Douglas and his wife went too .
"And Whiskers-on-the-moon strutted up the aisle to a front pew , as if he fully realized what a distinction he conferred upon the building ."
"People were somewhat surprised that he should be there , since he usually avoided all assemblages connected in any way with the war ."
"But Mr. Meredith had said that he hoped his session would be well represented , and Mr. Pryor had evidently taken the request to heart ."
"`` God bless you , Rilla-my-Rilla , '' he said softly and tenderly ."
After all it was not a hard thing to fight for a land that bore daughters like this .
He stood on the rear platform and waved to them as the train pulled out .
"Rilla was standing by herself , but Una Meredith came to her and the two girls who loved him most stood together and held each other 's cold hands as the train rounded the curve of the wooded hill ."
Rilla spent an hour in Rainbow Valley that morning about which she never said a word to anyone ; she did not even write in her diary about it ; when it was over she went home and made rompers for Jims .
In the evening she went to a Junior Red Cross committee meeting and was severely businesslike .
"`` You would never suppose , '' said Irene Howard to Olive Kirk afterwards , `` that Walter had left for the front only this morning ."
But some people really have no depth of feeling .
I often wish I could take things as lightly as Rilla Blythe . ''
"CHAPTER XVI REALISM AND ROMANCE `` Warsaw has fallen , '' said Dr. Blythe with a resigned air , as he brought the mail in one warm August day ."
"Gertrude and Mrs. Blythe looked dismally at each other , and Rilla , who was feeding Jims a Morganized diet from a carefully sterilized spoon , laid the said spoon down on his tray , utterly regardless of germs , and said , `` Oh , dear me , '' in as tragic a tone as if the news had come as a thunderbolt instead of being a foregone conclusion from the preceding week 's dispatches ."
"They had thought they were quite resigned to Warsaw 's fall but now they knew they had , as always , hoped against hope ."
"`` Now , let us take a brace , '' said Susan ."
`` It is not the terrible thing we have been thinking .
I read a dispatch three columns long in the Montreal Herald yesterday that proved that Warsaw was not important from a military point of view at all .
"So let us take the military point of view , doctor dear . ''"
"`` I read that dispatch , too , and it has encouraged me immensely , '' said Gertrude ."
`` I knew then and I know now that it was a lie from beginning to end .
"But I am in that state of mind where even a lie is a comfort , providing it is a cheerful lie . ''"
"`` In that case , Miss Oliver dear , the German official reports ought to be all you need , '' said Susan sarcastically ."
`` I never read them now because they make me so mad I can not put my thoughts properly on my work after a dose of them .
Even this news about Warsaw has taken the edge off my afternoon 's plans .
Misfortunes never come singly .
I spoiled my baking of bread today -- and now Warsaw has fallen -- and here is little Kitchener bent on choking himself to death . ''
"Jims was evidently trying to swallow his spoon , germs and all ."
Rilla rescued him mechanically and was about to resume the operation of feeding him when a casual remark of her father 's sent such a shock and thrill over her that for the second time she dropped that doomed spoon .
"`` Kenneth Ford is down at Martin West 's over-harbour , '' the doctor was saying ."
"`` His regiment was on its way to the front but was held up in Kingsport for some reason , and Ken got leave of absence to come over to the Island . ''"
"`` I hope he will come up to see us , '' exclaimed Mrs. Blythe ."
"`` He only has a day or two off , I believe , '' said the doctor absently ."
Nobody noticed Rilla 's flushed face and trembling hands .
Even the most thoughtful and watchful of parents do not see everything that goes on under their very noses .
"Cousin Sophia wanted them to elect Roosevelt , and is much disgruntled because they would not give him a chance ."
"I had a hankering for him myself , but we must believe that Providence over-rules these matters and be satisfied -- though what the Almighty means in this affair of Rumania I can not fathom -- saying it with all reverence . ''"
Susan fathomed it -- or thought she did -- when the Asquith ministry went down and Lloyd George became Premier .
"`` Mrs. Dr. dear , Lloyd George is at the helm at last ."
I have been praying for this for many a day .
Now we shall soon see a blessed change .
"It took the Rumanian disaster to bring it about , no less , and that is the meaning of it , though I could not see it before ."
There will be no more shilly-shallying .
"I consider that the war is as good as won , and that I shall tie to , whether Bucharest falls or not . ''"
Bucharest did fall -- and Germany proposed peace negotiations .
Whereat Susan scornfully turned a deaf ear and absolutely refused to listen to such proposals .
When President Wilson sent his famous December peace note Susan waxed violently sarcastic .
"`` Woodrow Wilson is going to make peace , I understand ."
First Henry Ford had a try at it and now comes Wilson .
"But peace is not made with ink , Woodrow , and that you may tie to , '' said Susan , apostrophizing the unlucky President out of the kitchen window nearest the United States ."
"`` Lloyd George 's speech will tell the Kaiser what is what , and you may keep your peace screeds at home and save postage . ''"
"`` What a pity President Wilson ca n't hear you , Susan , '' said Rilla slyly ."
"`` Indeed , Rilla dear , it is a pity that he has no one near him to give him good advice , as it is clear he has not , in all those Democrats and Republicans , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` I do not know the difference between them , for the politics of the Yankees is a puzzle I can not solve , study it as I may ."
"But as far as seeing through a grindstone goes , I am afraid -- '' Susan shook her head dubiously , `` that they are all tarred with the same brush . ''"
"`` I am thankful Christmas is over , '' Rilla wrote in her diary during the last week of a stormy December ."
`` We had dreaded it so -- the first Christmas since Courcelette .
But we had all the Merediths down for dinner and nobody tried to be gay or cheerful .
"We were all just quiet and friendly , and that helped ."
"Then , too , I was so thankful that Jims had got better -- so thankful that I almost felt glad -- almost but not quite ."
I wonder if I shall ever feel really glad over anything again .
It seems as if gladness were killed in me -- shot down by the same bullet that pierced Walter 's heart .
Perhaps some day a new kind of gladness will be born in my soul -- but the old kind will never live again .
`` Winter set in awfully early this year .
Ten days before Christmas we had a big snowstorm -- at least we thought it big at the time .
"As it happened , it was only a prelude to the real performance ."
"It was fine the next day , and Ingleside and Rainbow Valley were wonderful , with the trees all covered with snow , and big drifts everywhere , carved into the most fantastic shapes by the chisel of the northeast wind ."
We shall all go .
Selden was a man of his hands ; he was like a brother to me .
"Well , he has gone second ; well , we shall all follow !"
For what said their knave rhyme ?
-- ' A black arrow in each black heart . '
Was it not so it went ?
"Appleyard , Selden , Smith , old Humphrey gone ; and there lieth poor John Carter , crying , poor sinner , for the priest . ''"
Dick gave ear .
"Out of a low window , hard by where they were talking , groans and murmurs came to his ear ."
`` Lieth he there ? ''
he asked .
"`` Ay , in the second porter 's chamber , '' answered Hatch ."
"`` We could not bear him further , soul and body were so bitterly at odds ."
"At every step we lifted him , he thought to wend ."
"But now , methinks , it is the soul that suffereth ."
"Ever for the priest he crieth , and Sir Oliver , I wot not why , still cometh not ."
"`` Sir Daniel , '' he said , `` here is a right intricate affair , the which , with your good leave , it shall be mine to examine and adjust ."
"Content ye , then ; your business is in careful hands ; justice shall be done you ; and in the meanwhile , get ye incontinently home , and have your hurts attended ."
"The air is shrewd , and I would not ye took cold upon these scratches . ''"
"He made a sign with his hand ; it was passed down the nave by obsequious servants , who waited there upon his smallest gesture ."
"Instantly , without the church , a tucket sounded shrill , and through the open portal archers and men-at-arms , uniformly arrayed in the colours and wearing the badge of Lord Risingham , began to file into the church , took Dick and Lawless from those who still detained them , and , closing their files about the prisoners , marched forth again and disappeared ."
"As they were passing , Joanna held both her hands to Dick and cried him her farewell ; and the bridesmaid , nothing downcast by her uncle 's evident displeasure , blew him a kiss , with a `` Keep your heart up , lion-driver ! ''"
that for the first time since the accident called up a smile to the faces of the crowd .
"CHAPTER V -- EARL RISINGHAM Earl Risingham , although by far the most important person then in Shoreby , was poorly lodged in the house of a private gentleman upon the extreme outskirts of the town ."
"Nothing but the armed men at the doors , and the mounted messengers that kept arriving and departing , announced the temporary residence of a great lord ."
"Thus it was that , from lack of space , Dick and Lawless were clapped into the same apartment ."
"`` Well spoken , Master Richard , '' said the outlaw ; `` it was excellently well spoken , and , for my part , I thank you cordially ."
"Here we are in good hands ; we shall be justly tried , and , some time this evening , decently hanged on the same tree . ''"
"`` Indeed , my poor friend , I do believe it , '' answered Dick ."
"`` Yet have we a string to our bow , '' returned Lawless ."
"`` Ellis Duckworth is a man out of ten thousand ; he holdeth you right near his heart , both for your own and for your father 's sake ; and knowing you guiltless of this fact , he will stir earth and heaven to bear you clear . ''"
"`` It may not be , '' said Dick ."
"`` If he had been well spanked in his younger days he might have more sense now , '' retorted Susan ."
"`` But I suppose princes are never spanked , more is the pity ."
I see the Allies have sent him an ultimatum .
I could tell them that it will take more than ultimatums to skin a snake like Constantine .
"Perhaps the Allied blockade will hammer sense into his head ; but that will take some time I am thinking , and in the meantime what is to become of poor Serbia ? ''"
"They saw what became of Serbia , and during the process Susan was hardly to be lived with ."
"In her exasperation she abused everything and everybody except Kitchener , and she fell upon poor President Wilson tooth and claw ."
"`` If he had done his duty and gone into the war long ago we should not have seen this mess in Serbia , '' she avowed ."
"`` It would be a serious thing to plunge a great country like the United States , with its mixed population , into the war , Susan , '' said the doctor , who sometimes came to the defence of the President , not because he thought Wilson needed it especially , but from an unholy love of baiting Susan ."
"`` Maybe , doctor dear -- maybe !"
But that makes me think of the old story of the girl who told her grandmother she was going to be married .
"` It is a solemn thing to be married , ' said the old lady ."
"` Yes , but it is a solemner thing not to be , ' said the girl ."
"And I can testify to that out of my own experience , doctor dear ."
And I think it is a solemner thing for the Yankees that they have kept out of the war than it would have been if they had gone into it .
"However , though I do not know much about them , I am of the opinion that we will see them starting something yet , Woodrow Wilson or no Woodrow Wilson , when they get it into their heads that this war is not a correspondence school ."
"They will not , '' said Susan , energetically waving a saucepan with one hand and a soup ladle with the other , `` be too proud to fight then . ''"
"On a pale-yellow , windy evening in October Carl Meredith went away ."
He had enlisted on his eighteenth birthday .
John Meredith saw him off with a set face .
His two boys were gone -- there was only little Bruce left now .
He loved Bruce and Bruce 's mother dearly ; but Jerry and Carl were the sons of the bride of his youth and Carl was the only one of all his children who had Cecilia 's very eyes .
As they looked lovingly out at him above Carl 's uniform the pale minister suddenly remembered the day when for the first and last time he had tried to whip Carl for his prank with the eel .
That was the first time he had realised how much Carl 's eyes were like Cecilia 's .
Now he realised it again once more .
Would he ever again see his dead wife 's eyes looking at him from his son 's face ?
"What a bonny , clean , handsome lad he was !"
It was -- hard -- to see him go .
John Meredith seemed to be looking at a torn plain strewed with the bodies of `` able-bodied men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five . ''
"Only the other day Carl had been a little scrap of a boy , hunting bugs in Rainbow Valley , taking lizards to bed with him , and scandalizing the Glen by carrying frogs to Sunday School ."
It seemed hardly -- right -- somehow that he should be an `` able-bodied man '' in khaki .
Yet John Meredith had said no word to dissuade him when Carl had told him he must go .
"asked Oliver Sloane , arriving at this moment with a bandbox he had brought from town for Marilla ."
`` Have n't you heard ? ''
said Jane wrathfully .
"`` Well , its simply this ... Joshua Pye has gone and painted the hall blue instead of green ... a deep , brilliant blue , the shade they use for painting carts and wheelbarrows ."
"And Mrs. Lynde says it is the most hideous color for a building , especially when combined with a red roof , that she ever saw or imagined ."
You could simply have knocked me down with a feather when I heard it .
"It 's heartbreaking , after all the trouble we 've had . ''"
`` How on earth could such a mistake have happened ? ''
wailed Diana .
The blame of this unmerciful disaster was eventually narrowed down to the Pyes .
The Improvers had decided to use Morton-Harris paints and the Morton-Harris paint cans were numbered according to a color card .
A purchaser chose his shade on the card and ordered by the accompanying number .
"Number 147 was the shade of green desired and when Mr. Roger Pye sent word to the Improvers by his son , John Andrew , that he was going to town and would get their paint for them , the Improvers told John Andrew to tell his father to get 147 ."
"John Andrew always averred that he did so , but Mr. Roger Pye as stanchly declared that John Andrew told him 157 ; and there the matter stands to this day ."
That night there was blank dismay in every Avonlea house where an Improver lived .
The gloom at Green Gables was so intense that it quenched even Davy .
Anne wept and would not be comforted .
"`` I must cry , even if I am almost seventeen , Marilla , '' she sobbed ."
`` It is so mortifying .
And it sounds the death knell of our society .
We 'll simply be laughed out of existence . ''
"In life , as in dreams , however , things often go by contraries ."
The Avonlea people did not laugh ; they were too angry .
Their money had gone to paint the hall and consequently they felt themselves bitterly aggrieved by the mistake .
Public indignation centered on the Pyes .
"Roger Pye and John Andrew had bungled the matter between them ; and as for Joshua Pye , he must be a born fool not to suspect there was something wrong when he opened the cans and saw the color of the paint ."
"Joshua Pye , when thus animadverted upon , retorted that the Avonlea taste in colors was no business of his , whatever his private opinion might be ; he had been hired to paint the hall , not to talk about it ; and he meant to have his money for it ."
"The Improvers paid him his money in bitterness of spirit , after consulting Mr. Peter Sloane , who was a magistrate ."
"`` You 'll have to pay it , '' Peter told him ."
"`` You ca n't hold him responsible for the mistake , since he claims he was never told what the color was supposed to be but just given the cans and told to go ahead ."
But it 's a burning shame and that hall certainly does look awful . ''
"The luckless Improvers expected that Avonlea would be more prejudiced than ever against them ; but instead , public sympathy veered around in their favor ."
"It was now his business to seek out the Duke of Gloucester , who alone , in the disorder of the forces , might be able to supply him with a sufficiency of men ."
"The fighting in the main town was now practically at an end ; and as Dick ran hither and thither , seeking the commander , the streets were thick with wandering soldiers , some laden with more booty than they could well stagger under , others shouting drunk ."
"None of them , when questioned , had the least notion of the duke 's whereabouts ; and , at last , it was by sheer good fortune that Dick found him , where he sat in the saddle directing operations to dislodge the archers from the harbour side ."
"`` Sir Richard Shelton , ye are well found , '' he said ."
"`` I owe you one thing that I value little , my life ; and one that I can never pay you for , this victory ."
"Catesby , if I had ten such captains as Sir Richard , I would march forthright on London ."
"But now , sir , claim your reward . ''"
"`` Freely , my lord , '' said Dick , `` freely and loudly ."
"One hath escaped to whom I owe some grudges , and taken with him one whom I owe love and service ."
"Give me , then , fifty lances , that I may pursue ; and for any obligation that your graciousness is pleased to allow , it shall be clean discharged . ''"
`` How call ye him ? ''
inquired the duke .
"`` Sir Daniel Brackley , '' answered Richard ."
"`` Out upon him , double-face ! ''"
cried Gloucester .
"`` Here is no reward , Sir Richard ; here is fresh service offered , and , if that ye bring his head to me , a fresh debt upon my conscience ."
"Catesby , get him these lances ; and you , sir , bethink ye , in the meanwhile , what pleasure , honour , or profit it shall be mine to give you . ''"
"Just then the Yorkist skirmishers carried one of the shoreside taverns , swarming in upon it on three sides , and driving out or taking its defenders ."
"Crookback Dick was pleased to cheer the exploit , and pushing his horse a little nearer , called to see the prisoners ."
"There were four or five of them -- two men of my Lord Shoreby 's and one of Lord Risingham 's among the number , and last , but in Dick 's eyes not least , a tall , shambling , grizzled old shipman , between drunk and sober , and with a dog whimpering and jumping at his heels ."
The young duke passed them for a moment under a severe review .
"`` Good , '' he said ."
`` Hang them . ''
And he turned the other way to watch the progress of the fight .
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` so please you , I have found my reward ."
Grant me the life and liberty of yon old shipman . ''
Gloucester turned and looked the speaker in the face .
"`` Sir Richard , '' he said , `` I make not war with peacock 's feathers , but steel shafts ."
"Those that are mine enemies I slay , and that without excuse or favour ."
"For , bethink ye , in this realm of England , that is so torn in pieces , there is not a man of mine but hath a brother or a friend upon the other party ."
"If , then , I did begin to grant these pardons , I might sheathe my sword . ''"
"`` It may be so , my lord ; and yet I will be overbold , and at the risk of your disfavour , recall your lordship 's promise , '' replied Dick ."
"`` It is easy to try that , '' says Alan ."
"Duncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his principal possession , and to set before his guests a mutton-ham and a bottle of that drink which they call Athole brose , and which is made of old whiskey , strained honey and sweet cream , slowly beaten together in the right order and proportion ."
"The two enemies were still on the very breach of a quarrel ; but down they sat , one upon each side of the peat fire , with a mighty show of politeness ."
"Maclaren pressed them to taste his mutton-ham and `` the wife 's brose , '' reminding them the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her skill in that confection ."
But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad for the breath .
"`` I would have ye to remark , sir , '' said Alan , `` that I havenae broken bread for near upon ten hours , which will be worse for the breath than any brose in Scotland . ''"
"`` I will take no advantages , Mr. Stewart , '' replied Robin ."
`` Eat and drink ; I 'll follow you . ''
"Each ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to Mrs. Maclaren ; and then after a great number of civilities , Robin took the pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner ."
"`` Ay , ye can blow '' said Alan ; and taking the instrument from his rival , he first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin 's ; and then wandered into variations , which , as he went on , he decorated with a perfect flight of grace-notes , such as pipers love , and call the `` warblers . ''"
"I had been pleased with Robin 's playing , Alan 's ravished me ."
"`` That 's no very bad , Mr. Stewart , '' said the rival , `` but ye show a poor device in your warblers . ''"
`` Me ! ''
"cried Alan , the blood starting to his face ."
`` I give ye the lie . ''
"`` Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes , then , '' said Robin , `` that ye seek to change them for the sword ? ''"
"`` And that 's very well said , Mr. Macgregor , '' returned Alan ; `` and in the meantime '' -LRB- laying a strong accent on the word -RRB- `` I take back the lie ."
I appeal to Duncan . ''
"`` Indeed , ye need appeal to naebody , '' said Robin ."
`` Ye 're a far better judge than any Maclaren in Balquhidder : for it 's a God 's truth that you 're a very creditable piper for a Stewart .
Hand me the pipes . ''
"Alan did as he asked ; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some part of Alan 's variations , which it seemed that he remembered perfectly ."
"`` Ay , ye have music , '' said Alan , gloomily ."
"`` And now be the judge yourself , Mr. Stewart , '' said Robin ; and taking up the variations from the beginning , he worked them throughout to so new a purpose , with such ingenuity and sentiment , and with so odd a fancy and so quick a knack in the grace-notes , that I was amazed to hear him ."
"As for Alan , his face grew dark and hot , and he sat and gnawed his fingers , like a man under some deep affront ."
`` Enough ! ''
he cried .
`` Ye can blow the pipes -- make the most of that . ''
And he made as if to rise .
"But Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence , and struck into the slow measure of a pibroch ."
"It was a fine piece of music in itself , and nobly played ; but it seems , besides , it was a piece peculiar to the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan ."
"The first notes were scarce out , before there came a change in his face ; when the time quickened , he seemed to grow restless in his seat ; and long before that piece was at an end , the last signs of his anger died from him , and he had no thought but for the music ."
"Mrs. Milton White says she never met a perfect person , but she 's heard enough about one ... her husband 's first wife ."
Do n't you think it must be very uncomfortable to be married to a man whose first wife was perfect ? ''
"`` It would be more uncomfortable to be married to the perfect wife , '' declared Mr. Harrison , with a sudden and inexplicable warmth ."
"When tea was over Anne insisted on washing the dishes , although Mr. Harrison assured her that there were enough in the house to do for weeks yet ."
"She would dearly have loved to sweep the floor also , but no broom was visible and she did not like to ask where it was for fear there was n't one at all ."
"`` You might run across and talk to me once in a while , '' suggested Mr. Harrison when she was leaving . ''"
'T is n't far and folks ought to be neighborly .
I 'm kind of interested in that society of yours .
Seems to me there 'll be some fun in it .
Who are you going to tackle first ? ''
"`` We are not going to meddle with PEOPLE ... it is only PLACES we mean to improve , '' said Anne , in a dignified tone ."
She rather suspected that Mr. Harrison was making fun of the project .
"When she had gone Mr. Harrison watched her from the window ... a lithe , girlish shape , tripping lightheartedly across the fields in the sunset afterglow ."
"`` I 'm a crusty , lonesome , crabbed old chap , '' he said aloud , `` but there 's something about that little girl makes me feel young again ... and it 's such a pleasant sensation I 'd like to have it repeated once in a while . ''"
"`` Redheaded snippet , '' croaked Ginger mockingly ."
Mr. Harrison shook his fist at the parrot .
"`` You ornery bird , '' he muttered , `` I almost wish I 'd wrung your neck when my brother the sailor brought you home ."
Will you never be done getting me into trouble ? ''
"Anne ran home blithely and recounted her adventures to Marilla , who had been not a little alarmed by her long absence and was on the point of starting out to look for her ."
"`` It 's a pretty good world , after all , is n't it , Marilla ? ''"
concluded Anne happily .
`` Mrs. Lynde was complaining the other day that it was n't much of a world .
She said whenever you looked forward to anything pleasant you were sure to be more or less disappointed ... perhaps that is true .
But there is a good side to it too .
The bad things do n't always come up to your expectations either ... they nearly always turn out ever so much better than you think .
I looked forward to a dreadfully unpleasant experience when I went over to Mr. Harrison 's tonight ; and instead he was quite kind and I had almost a nice time .
"I think we 're going to be real good friends if we make plenty of allowances for each other , and everything has turned out for the best ."
"But all the same , Marilla , I shall certainly never again sell a cow before making sure to whom she belongs ."
And I do NOT like parrots ! ''
"IV Different Opinions One evening at sunset , Jane Andrews , Gilbert Blythe , and Anne Shirley were lingering by a fence in the shadow of gently swaying spruce boughs , where a wood cut known as the Birch Path joined the main road ."
"Jane had been up to spend the afternoon with Anne , who walked part of the way home with her ; at the fence they met Gilbert , and all three were now talking about the fateful morrow ; for that morrow was the first of September and the schools would open ."
Jane would go to Newbridge and Gilbert to White Sands .
"`` Come on , Nat , '' he said , and slouched out again ."
"`` Thank you , ma'am , '' added Nat , as he followed him , feeling without quite understanding the difference in the welcome given to him and to his ungracious friend ."
`` The fellows are having a circus out in the barn ; do n't you want to come and see it ? ''
"he asked , as they came down the wide steps on to the lawn ."
`` Are they big fellows ? ''
said Dan .
`` No ; the big ones are gone fishing . ''
"`` Fire away , then , '' said Dan ."
"Nat led him to the great barn and introduced him to his set , who were disporting themselves among the half-empty lofts ."
"A large circle was marked out with hay on the wide floor , and in the middle stood Demi with a long whip , while Tommy , mounted on the much-enduring Toby , pranced about the circle playing being a monkey ."
"`` You must pay a pin apiece , or you ca n't see the show , '' said Stuffy , who stood by the wheelbarrow in which sat the band , consisting of a pocket-comb blown upon by Ned , and a toy drum beaten spasmodically by Rob ."
"`` He 's company , so I 'll pay for both , '' said Nat , handsomely , as he stuck two crooked pins in the dried mushroom which served as money-box ."
"With a nod to the company they seated themselves on a couple of boards , and the performance went on ."
"After the monkey act , Ned gave them a fine specimen of his agility by jumping over an old chair , and running up and down ladders , sailor fashion ."
Then Demi danced a jig with a gravity beautiful to behold .
"Nat was called upon to wrestle with Stuffy , and speedily laid that stout youth upon the ground ."
"After this , Tommy proudly advanced to turn a somersault , an accomplishment which he had acquired by painful perseverance , practising in private till every joint of his little frame was black and blue ."
"His feats were received with great applause , and he was about to retire , flushed with pride and a rush of blood to the head , when a scornful voice in the audience was heard to say , `` Ho !"
that ai n't any thing ! ''
"`` Say that again , will you ? ''"
and Tommy bristled up like an angry turkey-cock .
`` Do you want to fight ? ''
"said Dan , promptly descending from the barrel and doubling up his fists in a business-like manner ."
"`` No , I do n't ; '' and the candid Thomas retired a step , rather taken aback by the proposition ."
`` Fighting is n't allowed ! ''
"cried the others , much excited ."
"`` You 're a nice lot , '' sneered Dan ."
"`` Come , if you do n't behave , you sha n't stay , '' said Nat , firing up at that insult to his friends ."
"`` I 'd like to see him do better than I did , that 's all , '' observed Tommy , with a swagger ."
"`` Clear the way , then , '' and without the slightest preparation Dan turned three somersaults one after the other and came up on his feet ."
"`` You ca n't beat that , Tom ; you always hit your head and tumble flat , '' said Nat , pleased at his friend 's success ."
"Before he could say any more the audience were electrified by three more somersaults backwards , and a short promenade on the hands , head down , feet up ."
"Here 's Dan now , full of stories about birds , and bugs , and so on ; let him take care of the museum , and once a week the rest of you take turns to read a composition , or tell about some animal , mineral , or vegetable ."
"We should all like that , and I think it would put considerable useful knowledge into our heads ."
"What do you say , Professor ? ''"
"`` I like it much , and will give the lads all the help I can ."
"But they will need books to read up these new subjects , and we have not many , I fear , '' began Mr. Bhaer , looking much pleased , planning many fine lectures on geology , which he liked ."
`` We should have a library for the special purpose . ''
"`` Is that a useful sort of book , Dan ? ''"
"asked Mr. Laurie , pointing to the volume that lay open by the cabinet ."
"`` Oh , yes !"
it tells all I want to know about insects .
I had it here to see how to fix the butterflies right .
"I covered it , so it is not hurt ; '' and Dan caught it up , fearing the lender might think him careless ."
"`` Give it here a minute ; '' and , pulling out his pencil , Mr. Laurie wrote Dan 's name in it , saying , as he set the book up on one of the corner shelves , where nothing stood but a stuffed bird without a tail , `` There , that is the beginning of the museum library ."
"I 'll hunt up some more books , and Demi shall keep them in order ."
"Where are those jolly little books we used to read , Jo ?"
"` Insect Architecture ' or some such name , all about ants having battles , and bees having queens , and crickets eating holes in our clothes and stealing milk , and larks of that sort . ''"
`` In the garret at home .
"I 'll have them sent out , and we will plunge into Natural History with a will , '' said Mrs. Jo , ready for any thing ."
`` Wo n't it be hard to write about such things ? ''
"asked Nat , who hated compositions ."
"`` At first , perhaps ; but you will soon like it ."
"If you think that hard , how would you like to have this subject given to you , as it was to a girl of thirteen : A conversation between Themistocles , Aristides , and Pericles on the proposed appropriation of funds of the confederacy of Delos for the ornamentation of Athens ? ''"
said Mrs. Jo .
"The boys groaned at the mere sound of the long names , and the gentlemen laughed at the absurdity of the lesson ."
`` Did she write it ? ''
"asked Demi , in an awe-stricken tone ."
"`` Yes , but you can imagine what a piece of work she make of it , though she was rather a bright child . ''"
"`` I 'd like to have seen it , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Perhaps I can find it for you ; I went to school with her , '' and Mrs. Jo looked so wicked that every one knew who the little girl was ."
Hearing of this fearful subject for a composition quite reconciled the boys to the thought of writing about familiar things .
"Wednesday afternoon was appointed for the lectures , as they preferred to call them , for some chose to talk instead of write ."
"Mr. Bhaer promised a portfolio in which the written productions should be kept , and Mrs. Bhaer said she would attend the course with great pleasure ."
"The doctor and his wife went to the Manse , Shirley and Miss Oliver went they alone knew where , Susan went to the store for household supplies , and Jims went to Dreamland ."
"Rilla put on her georgette gown , knotted up her hair and bound a little double string of pearls around it ."
Then she tucked a cluster of pale pink baby roses at her belt .
Would Ken ask her for a rose for a keepsake ?
She knew that Jem had carried to the trenches in Flanders a faded rose that Faith Meredith had kissed and given him the night before he left .
Rilla looked very sweet when she met Ken in the mingled moonlight and vine shadows of the big veranda .
The hand she gave him was cold and she was so desperately anxious not to lisp that her greeting was prim and precise .
How handsome and tall Kenneth looked in his lieutenant 's uniform !
"It made him seem older , too -- so much so that Rilla felt rather foolish ."
"Had n't it been the height of absurdity for her to suppose that this splendid young officer had anything special to say to her , little Rilla Blythe of Glen St. Mary ?"
"Likely she had n't understood him after all -- he had only meant that he did n't want a mob of folks around making a fuss over him and trying to lionize him , as they had probably done over-harbour ."
"Yes , of course , that was all he meant -- and she , little idiot , had gone and vainly imagined that he did n't want anybody but her ."
"And he would think she had manoeuvred everybody away so that they could be alone together , and he would laugh to himself at her ."
"`` This is better luck than I hoped for , '' said Ken , leaning back in his chair and looking at her with very unconcealed admiration in his eloquent eyes ."
"`` I was sure someone would be hanging about and it was just you I wanted to see , Rilla-my-Rilla . ''"
Rilla 's dream castle flashed into the landscape again .
This was unmistakable enough certainly -- not much doubt as to his meaning here .
"`` There are n't -- so many of us -- to poke around as there used to be , '' she said softly ."
"`` No , that 's so , '' said Ken gently ."
"`` Jem and Walter and the girls away -- it makes a big blank , does n't it ?"
But -- '' he leaned forward until his dark curls almost brushed her hair -- `` does n't Fred Arnold try to fill the blank occasionally .
I 've been told so . ''
"At this moment , before Rilla could make any reply , Jims began to cry at the top of his voice in the room whose open window was just above them -- Jims , who hardly ever cried in the evening ."
"Moreover , he was crying , as Rilla knew from experience , with a vim and energy that betokened that he had been already whimpering softly unheard for some time and was thoroughly exasperated ."
When Jims started in crying like that he made a thorough job of it .
Rilla knew that there was no use to sit still and pretend to ignore him .
He would n't stop ; and conversation of any kind was out of the question when such shrieks and howls were floating over your head .
"Besides , she was afraid Kenneth would think she was utterly unfeeling if she sat still and let a baby cry like that ."
He was not likely acquainted with Morgan 's invaluable volume .
She got up .
"`` Jims has had a nightmare , I think ."
He sometimes has one and he is always badly frightened by it .
"But she shook her head and I heard her telling mother later that , in her opinion , ` cooties ' and ` sarks ' were not proper subjects for young girls to talk about ."
"She was especially horrified when Jem wrote in his last letter to mother , ` Tell Susan I had a fine cootie hunt this morning and caught fifty-three ! '"
Susan positively turned pea-green .
"` Mrs. Dr. dear , ' she said , ` when I was young , if decent people were so unfortunate as to get -- those insects -- they kept it a secret if possible ."
"I do not want to be narrow-minded , Mrs. Dr. dear , but I still think it is better not to mention such things . '"
`` Miranda grew confidential over our vermin shirts and told me all her troubles .
She is desperately unhappy .
She is engaged to Joe Milgrave and Joe joined up in October and has been training in Charlottetown ever since .
Her father was furious when he joined and forbade Miranda ever to have any dealing or communication with him again .
"Poor Joe expects to go overseas any day and wants Miranda to marry him before he goes , which shows that there have been ` communications ' in spite of Whiskers-on-the-moon ."
"Miranda wants to marry him but can not , and she declares it will break her heart . ''"
` Why do n't you run away and marry him ? '
I said .
It did n't go against my conscience in the least to give her such advice .
"Joe Milgrave is a splendid fellow and Mr. Pryor fairly beamed on him until the war broke out and I know Mr. Pryor would forgive Miranda very quickly , once it was over and he wanted his housekeeper back ."
But Miranda shook her silvery head dolefully . ''
` Joe wants me to but I ca n't .
"Mother 's last words to me , as she lay on her dying-bed , were , `` Never , never run away , Miranda , '' and I promised . '"
"`` Miranda 's mother died two years ago , and it seems , according to Miranda , that her mother and father actually ran away to be married themselves ."
To picture Whiskers-on-the-moon as the hero of an elopement is beyond my power .
But such was the case and Mrs. Pryor at least lived to repent it .
"She had a hard life of it with Mr. Pryor , and she thought it was a punishment on her for running away ."
"So she made Miranda promise she would never , for any reason whatever , do it ."
"`` Of course , you can not urge a girl to break a promise made to a dying mother , so I did not see what Miranda could do unless she got Joe to come to the house when her father was away and marry her there ."
But Miranda said that could n't be managed .
"Her father seemed to suspect she might be up to something of the sort and he never went away for long at a time , and , of course , Joe could n't get leave of absence at an hour 's notice . ''"
"` No , I shall just have to let Joe go , and he will be killed -- I know he will be killed -- and my heart will break , ' said Miranda , her tears running down and copiously bedewing the vermin shirts !"
`` I am not writing like this for lack of any real sympathy with poor Miranda .
"I 've just got into the habit of giving things a comical twist if I can , when I 'm writing to Jem and Walter and Ken , to make them laugh ."
I really felt sorry for Miranda who is as much in love with Joe as a china-blue girl can be with anyone and who is dreadfully ashamed of her father 's pro-German sentiments .
"I think she understood that I did , for she said she had wanted to tell me all about her worries because I had grown so sympathetic this past year ."
I wonder if I have .
`` I knew it !
"Bring the child to me , and do n't fret ."
"I 'll see to him , and next time you do as I say , '' was the consoling welcome she received as the old lady popped up a sleepy but anxious face in a large flannel cap , and shook the bottle with the air of a general who had routed the foe before and meant to do it again ."
"Leaving her little responsibility in Miss Bat 's arms , Molly retired to wet her pillow with a few remorseful tears , and to fall asleep , wondering if real missionaries ever killed their pupils in the process of conversion ."
"So the girls all failed in the beginning ; but they did not give up , and succeeded better next time , as we shall see ."
Chapter IX .
"The Debating Club `` Look here , old man , we ought to have a meeting ."
"Holidays are over , and we must brace up and attend to business , '' said Frank to Gus , as they strolled out of the schoolyard one afternoon in January , apparently absorbed in conversation , but in reality waiting for a blue cloud and a scarlet feather to appear on the steps ."
`` All right .
"When , where , and what ? ''"
"asked Gus , who was a man of few words ."
"`` To-night , our house , subject , ` Shall girls go to college with us ? '"
"Mother said we had better be making up our minds , because every one is talking about it , and we shall have to be on one side or the other , so we may as well settle it now , '' answered Frank , for there was an impression among the members that all vexed questions would be much helped by the united eloquence and wisdom of the club ."
`` Very good ; I 'll pass the word and be there .
"Hullo , Neddy !"
"The D.C. meets to-night , at Minot 's , seven sharp ."
"Co-ed , & c. , '' added Gus , losing no time , as a third boy came briskly round the corner , with a little bag in his hand ."
`` I 'll come .
"Got home an hour earlier to-night , and thought I 'd look you up as I went by , '' responded Ed Devlin , as he took possession of the third post , with a glance toward the schoolhouse to see if a seal-skin cap , with a long , yellow braid depending therefrom , was anywhere in sight ."
"`` Very good of you , I 'm sure , '' said Gus , ironically , not a bit deceived by this polite attention ."
"`` The longest way round is sometimes the shortest way home , hey , Ed ? ''"
and Frank gave him a playful poke that nearly sent him off his perch .
"Then they all laughed at some joke of their own , and Gus added , `` No girls coming to hear us to-night ."
"Do n't think it , my son ."
"`` More 's the pity , '' and Ed shook his head regretfully over the downfall of his hopes ."
"`` Ca n't help it ; the other fellows say they spoil the fun , so we have to give in , sometimes , for the sake of peace and quietness ."
"Do n't mind having them a bit myself , '' said Frank , in such a tone of cheerful resignation that they laughed again , for the `` Triangle , '' as the three chums were called , always made merry music ."
`` We must have a game party next week .
"The girls like that , and so do I , '' candidly observed Gus , whose pleasant parlors were the scene of many such frolics ."
"`` And so do your sisters and your cousins and your aunts , '' hummed Ed , for Gus was often called Admiral because he really did possess three sisters , two cousins , and four aunts , besides mother and grandmother , all living in the big house together ."
"The boys promptly joined in the popular chorus , and other voices all about the yard took it up , for the `` Pinafore '' epidemic raged fearfully in Harmony Village that winter ."
`` How 's business ? ''
Sometimes he fell and cut himself ; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion ; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably .
"In the meantime , we could never make out where he got the drink ."
That was the ship 's mystery .
"Watch him as we pleased , we could do nothing to solve it ; and when we asked him to his face , he would only laugh if he were drunk , and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water ."
"He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men , but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright , so nobody was much surprised , nor very sorry , when one dark night , with a head sea , he disappeared entirely and was seen no more ."
`` Overboard ! ''
said the captain .
"`` Well , gentlemen , that saves the trouble of putting him in irons . ''"
"But there we were , without a mate ; and it was necessary , of course , to advance one of the men ."
"The boatswain , Job Anderson , was the likeliest man aboard , and though he kept his old title , he served in a way as mate ."
"Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea , and his knowledge made him very useful , for he often took a watch himself in easy weather ."
"And the coxswain , Israel Hands , was a careful , wily , old , experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything ."
"He was a great confidant of Long John Silver , and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship 's cook , Barbecue , as the men called him ."
"Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck , to have both hands as free as possible ."
"It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead , and propped against it , yielding to every movement of the ship , get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore ."
Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck .
"He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces -- Long John 's earrings , they were called ; and he would hand himself from one place to another , now using the crutch , now trailing it alongside by the lanyard , as quickly as another man could walk ."
Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced .
"`` He 's no common man , Barbecue , '' said the coxswain to me ."
`` He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded ; and brave -- a lion 's nothing alongside of Long John !
I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together -- him unarmed . ''
All the crew respected and even obeyed him .
He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service .
"To me he was unweariedly kind , and always glad to see me in the galley , which he kept as clean as a new pin , the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner ."
"`` Come away , Hawkins , '' he would say ; `` come and have a yarn with John ."
"Nobody more welcome than yourself , my son ."
Sit you down and hear the news .
"Here 's Cap'n Flint -- I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint , after the famous buccaneer -- here 's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v ` yage ."
"Was n't you , cap'n ? ''"
"And the parrot would say , with great rapidity , `` Pieces of eight !"
Pieces of eight !
Pieces of eight ! ''
"When two people do n't care overly much for each other , Nora May , a quarrel never amounts to much between them , and it 's soon made up ."
But when they love each other better than life it cuts so deep and hurts so much that nine times out of ten they wo n't ever forgive each other .
"The more you love anybody , Nora May , the more he can hurt you ."
"To be sure , you 're too young to be thinking of such things ."
"It all came like a thunderclap on Gil 's friends here at Greendale , because we had n't ever suspected things were going wrong ."
"The first thing we knew was that Anne had gone up west to teach school again at St. Mary 's , eighty miles away , and Gilbert , he went out to Manitoba on a harvest excursion and stayed there ."
It just about broke his parents ' hearts .
He was their only child and they just worshipped him .
"Gil and Anne both wrote to me off and on , but never a word , not so much as a name , did they say of each other ."
"I 'd ` a ' writ and asked 'em the rights of the fuss if I could , in hopes of patching it up , but I ca n't write now -- my hand is too shaky -- and mebbe it was just as well , for meddling is terribly risky work in a love trouble , Nora May ."
Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the last state of a meddler and them she meddles with is worse than the first .
"So I just set tight and said nothing , while everybody else in the clan was talking Anne and Gil sixty words to the minute ."
"Well , last birthday morning I was feeling terrible disperrited ."
"I had made up my mind that my birthday was always to be a good thing for other people , and there did n't seem one blessed thing I could do to make anybody glad ."
Emma Matilda and George and the children were all well and happy and wanted for nothing that I could give them .
"I begun to be afraid I 'd lived long enough , Nora May ."
"When a woman gets to the point where she ca n't give a gift of joy to anyone , there ai n't much use in her living ."
I felt real old and worn out and useless .
"I was sitting here under these very trees -- they was just budding out in leaf then , as young and cheerful as if they was n't a hundred years old ."
"And I sighed right out loud and said , `` Oh , Grandpa Holland , it 's time I was put away up on the hill there with you . ''"
"And with that the gate banged and there was Nancy Jane Whitmore 's boy , Sam , with two letters for me ."
One was from Anne up at St. Mary 's and the other was from Gil out in Manitoba .
I read Anne 's first .
She just struck right into things in the first paragraph .
"She said her year at St. Mary 's was nearly up , and when it was she meant to quit teaching and go away to New York and learn to be a trained nurse ."
"She said she was just broken-hearted about Gilbert , and would always love him to the day of her death ."
"But she knew he did n't care anything more about her after the way he had acted , and there was nothing left for her in life but to do something for other people , and so on and so on , for twelve mortal pages ."
"Anne is a fine writer , and I just cried like a babe over that letter , it was so touching , although I was enjoying myself hugely all the time , I was so delighted to find out that Anne loved Gilbert still ."
"I was getting skeered she did n't , her letters all winter had been so kind of jokey and frivolous , all about the good times she was having , and the parties she went to , and the new dresses she got ."
New dresses !
"When I read that letter of Anne 's , I knew that all the purple and fine linen in the world was just like so much sackcloth and ashes to her as long as Gilbert was sulking out on a prairie farm ."
"Well , I wiped my eyes and polished up my specs , but I might have spared myself the trouble , for in five minutes , Nora May , there was I sobbing again ; over Gilbert 's letter ."
"Tony could always outdistance her easily , but never had she known him speed away so quickly as now , and she was sure he hurried that he might have more time to hide ."
"`` Brave , brave ! ''"
"her doting eyes were crying when she got a dreadful shock ; instead of hiding , her hero had run out at the gate !"
"At this bitter sight Maimie stopped blankly , as if all her lapful of darling treasures were suddenly spilled , and then for very disdain she could not sob ; in a swell of protest against all puling cowards she ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid in Tony 's stead ."
When the ayah reached the gate and saw Tony far in front she thought her other charge was with him and passed out .
"Twilight came on , and scores and hundreds of people passed out , including the last one , who always has to run for it , but Maimie saw them not ."
She had shut her eyes tight and glued them with passionate tears .
When she opened them something very cold ran up her legs and up her arms and dropped into her heart .
It was the stillness of the Gardens .
"Then she heard clang , then from another part clang , then clang , clang far away ."
It was the Closing of the Gates .
"Immediately the last clang had died away Maimie distinctly heard a voice say , `` So that 's all right . ''"
"It had a wooden sound and seemed to come from above , and she looked up in time to see an elm tree stretching out its arms and yawning ."
"She was about to say , `` I never knew you could speak ! ''"
"when a metallic voice that seemed to come from the ladle at the well remarked to the elm , `` I suppose it is a bit coldish up there ? ''"
"and the elm replied , `` Not particularly , but you do get numb standing so long on one leg , '' and he flapped his arms vigorously just as the cabmen do before they drive off ."
Maimie was quite surprised to see that a number of other tall trees were doing the same sort of thing and she stole away to the Baby Walk and crouched observantly under a Minorca Holly which shrugged its shoulders but did not seem to mind her .
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , when Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this , he pressed a spring in the trunk and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow ."
"`` Oh , you naughty , naughty child ! ''"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but the chrysanthemums heard her , and they all said so pointedly `` Hoity-toity , what is this ? ''"
He asked himself if he had not been hard-hearted to fly away without saying good-bye to Solomon .
"`` I should like awfully to sail in my boat just once more , '' he said wistfully to his sleeping mother ."
He quite argued with her as if she could hear him .
"`` It would be so splendid to tell the birds of this adventure , '' he said coaxingly ."
"`` I promise to come back , '' he said solemnly and meant it , too ."
"And in the end , you know , he flew away ."
"Twice he came back from the window , wanting to kiss his mother , but he feared the delight of it might waken her , so at last he played her a lovely kiss on his pipe , and then he flew back to the Gardens ."
Many nights and even months passed before he asked the fairies for his second wish ; and I am not sure that I quite know why he delayed so long .
"One reason was that he had so many good-byes to say , not only to his particular friends , but to a hundred favourite spots ."
"Then he had his last sail , and his very last sail , and his last sail of all , and so on ."
"Again , a number of farewell feasts were given in his honour ; and another comfortable reason was that , after all , there was no hurry , for his mother would never weary of waiting for him ."
"This last reason displeased old Solomon , for it was an encouragement to the birds to procrastinate ."
"Solomon had several excellent mottoes for keeping them at their work , such as `` Never put off laying to-day , because you can lay to-morrow , '' and `` In this world there are no second chances , '' and yet here was Peter gaily putting off and none the worse for it ."
"The birds pointed this out to each other , and fell into lazy habits ."
"But , mind you , though Peter was so slow in going back to his mother , he was quite decided to go back ."
The best proof of this was his caution with the fairies .
"They were most anxious that he should remain in the Gardens to play to them , and to bring this to pass they tried to trick him into making such a remark as `` I wish the grass was not so wet , '' and some of them danced out of time in the hope that he might cry , `` I do wish you would keep time ! ''"
Then they would have said that this was his second wish .
"But he smoked their design , and though on occasions he began , `` I wish -- '' he always stopped in time ."
"So when at last he said to them bravely , `` I wish now to go back to mother for ever and always , '' they had to tickle his shoulder and let him go ."
"He went in a hurry in the end because he had dreamt that his mother was crying , and he knew what was the great thing she cried for , and that a hug from her splendid Peter would quickly make her to smile ."
"Oh , he felt sure of it , and so eager was he to be nestling in her arms that this time he flew straight to the window , which was always to be open for him ."
"But the window was closed , and there were iron bars on it , and peering inside he saw his mother sleeping peacefully with her arm round another little boy ."
"Peter called , `` Mother !"
mother ! ''
but she heard him not ; in vain he beat his little limbs against the iron bars .
"He had to fly back , sobbing , to the Gardens , and he never saw his dear again ."
What a glorious boy he had meant to be to her .
"Ah , Peter , we who have made the great mistake , how differently we should all act at the second chance ."
"But Solomon was right ; there is no second chance , not for most of us ."
When we reach the window it is Lock-out Time .
_BOOK_TITLE_ : James_Matthew_Barrie___Peter_and_Wendy.txt.out
"`` The Russians are doing splendidly , however , and they have saved Italy ."
But even when the daily news of their sweeping advance comes we do n't feel like running up the flag as we used to do .
"As Gertrude says , Verdun has slain all exultation ."
We would all feel more like rejoicing if the victories were on the western front .
` When will the British strike ? '
Gertrude sighed this morning .
` We have waited so long -- so long . '
`` Our greatest local event in recent weeks was the route march the county battalion made through the county before it left for overseas .
"They marched from Charlottetown to Lowbridge , then round the Harbour Head and through the Upper Glen and so down to the St. Mary station ."
"Everybody turned out to see them , except old Aunt Fannie Clow , who is bedridden and Mr. Pryor , who had n't been seen out even in church since the night of the Union Prayer Meeting the previous week ."
`` It was wonderful and heartbreaking to see that battalion marching past .
There were young men and middle-aged men in it .
"There was Laurie McAllister from over-harbour who is only sixteen but swore he was eighteen , so that he could enlist ; and there was Angus Mackenzie , from the Upper Glen who is fifty-five if he is a day and swore he was forty-four ."
"There were two South African veterans from Lowbridge , and the three eighteen-year-old Baxter triplets from Harbour Head ."
"Everybody cheered as they went by , and they cheered Foster Booth , who is forty , walking side by side with his son Charley who is twenty ."
"Charley 's mother died when he was born , and when Charley enlisted Foster said he 'd never yet let Charley go anywhere he dare n't go himself , and he did n't mean to begin with the Flanders trenches ."
At the station Dog Monday nearly went out of his head .
He tore about and sent messages to Jem by them all .
Mr. Meredith read an address and Reta Crawford recited ` The Piper . '
"The soldiers cheered her like mad and cried ` We 'll follow -- we 'll follow -- we wo n't break faith , ' and I felt so proud to think that it was my dear brother who had written such a wonderful , heart-stirring thing ."
And then I looked at the khaki ranks and wondered if those tall fellows in uniform could be the boys I 've laughed with and played with and danced with and teased all my life .
Something seems to have touched them and set them apart .
They have heard the Piper 's call .
"`` Fred Arnold was in the battalion and I felt dreadfully about him , for I realized that it was because of me that he was going away with such a sorrowful expression ."
I could n't help it but I felt as badly as if I could .
"`` The last evening of his leave Fred came up to Ingleside and told me he loved me and asked me if I would promise to marry him some day , if he ever came back ."
He was desperately in earnest and I felt more wretched than I ever did in my life .
"I could n't promise him that -- why , even if there was no question of Ken , I do n't care for Fred that way and never could -- but it seemed so cruel and heartless to send him away to the front without any hope of comfort ."
"I cried like a baby ; and yet -- oh , I am afraid that there must be something incurably frivolous about me , because , right in the middle of it all , with me crying and Fred looking so wild and tragic , the thought popped into my head that it would be an unendurable thing to see that nose across from me at the breakfast table every morning of my life ."
"There , that is one of the entries I would n't want my descendants to read in this journal ."
But it is the humiliating truth ; and perhaps it 's just as well that thought did come or I might have been tricked by pity and remorse into giving him some rash assurance .
If Fred 's nose were as handsome as his eyes and mouth some such thing might have happened .
We all seem to be getting on pretty well .
"The Newbridge people like Jane , I hear ; and I think White Sands is tolerably satisfied with your humble servant ... all except Mr. Andrew Spencer ."
I met Mrs. Peter Blewett on my way home last night and she told me she thought it her duty to inform me that Mr. Spencer did n't approve of my methods . ''
"`` Have you ever noticed , '' asked Anne reflectively , `` that when people say it is their duty to tell you a certain thing you may prepare for something disagreeable ?"
Why is it that they never seem to think it a duty to tell you the pleasant things they hear about you ?
"Mrs. H. B. DonNELL called at the school again yesterday and told me she thought it HER duty to inform me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew did n't approve of my reading fairy tales to the children , and that Mr. Rogerson thought Prillie was n't coming on fast enough in arithmetic ."
If Prillie would spend less time making eyes at the boys over her slate she might do better .
"I feel quite sure that Jack Gillis works her class sums for her , though I 've never been able to catch him red-handed . ''"
`` Have you succeeded in reconciling Mrs. DonNELL 's hopeful son to his saintly name ? ''
"`` Yes , '' laughed Anne , `` but it was really a difficult task ."
"At first , when I called him ` St. Clair ' he would not take the least notice until I 'd spoken two or three times ; and then , when the other boys nudged him , he would look up with such an aggrieved air , as if I 'd called him John or Charlie and he could n't be expected to know I meant him ."
So I kept him in after school one night and talked kindly to him .
I told him his mother wished me to call him St. Clair and I could n't go against her wishes .
He saw it when it was all explained out ... he 's really a very reasonable little fellow ... and he said I could call him St. Clair but that he 'd ` lick the stuffing ' out of any of the boys that tried it .
"Of course , I had to rebuke him again for using such shocking language ."
Since then I call him St. Clair and the boys call him Jake and all goes smoothly .
"He informs me that he means to be a carpenter , but Mrs. DonNELL says I am to make a college professor out of him . ''"
"The mention of college gave a new direction to Gilbert 's thoughts , and they talked for a time of their plans and wishes ... gravely , earnestly , hopefully , as youth loves to talk , while the future is yet an untrodden path full of wonderful possibilities ."
Gilbert had finally made up his mind that he was going to be a doctor .
"`` It 's a splendid profession , '' he said enthusiastically ."
`` A fellow has to fight something all through life ... did n't somebody once define man as a fighting animal ?
... and I want to fight disease and pain and ignorance ... which are all members one of another .
"I want to do my share of honest , real work in the world , Anne ... add a little to the sum of human knowledge that all the good men have been accumulating since it began ."
The folks who lived before me have done so much for me that I want to show my gratitude by doing something for the folks who will live after me .
It seems to me that is the only way a fellow can get square with his obligations to the race . ''
"`` I 'd like to add some beauty to life , '' said Anne dreamily ."
`` I do n't exactly want to make people KNOW more ... though I know that IS the noblest ambition ... but I 'd love to make them have a pleasanter time because of me ... to have some little joy or happy thought that would never have existed if I had n't been born . ''
"`` I think you 're fulfilling that ambition every day , '' said Gilbert admiringly ."
And he was right .
Anne was one of the children of light by birthright .
"After she had passed through a life with a smile or a word thrown across it like a gleam of sunshine the owner of that life saw it , for the time being at least , as hopeful and lovely and of good report ."
Finally Gilbert rose regretfully .
Dick exclaimed .
`` Small blame to him .
"Ye look liker maid than man ; and I tell you more -- y ' are a strange-looking rogue for a boy ; but for a hussy , Jack , ye would be right fair -- ye would ."
Ye would be well favoured for a wench . ''
"`` Well , '' said Matcham , `` ye know right well that I am none . ''"
"`` Nay , I know that ; I do but jest , '' said Dick ."
"`` Ye 'll be a man before your mother , Jack ."
"What cheer , my bully !"
Ye shall strike shrewd strokes .
"Now , which , I marvel , of you or me , shall be first knighted , Jack ?"
"for knighted I shall be , or die for ` t. ` Sir Richard Shelton , Knight ' : it soundeth bravely ."
But ` Sir John Matcham ' soundeth not amiss . ''
"`` Prithee , Dick , stop till I drink , '' said the other , pausing where a little clear spring welled out of the slope into a gravelled basin no bigger than a pocket ."
"`` And O , Dick , if I might come by anything to eat !"
-- my very heart aches with hunger . ''
"`` Why , fool , did ye not eat at Kettley ? ''"
asked Dick .
"`` I had made a vow -- it was a sin I had been led into , '' stammered Matcham ; `` but now , if it were but dry bread , I would eat it greedily . ''"
"`` Sit ye , then , and eat , '' said Dick , `` while that I scout a little forward for the road . ''"
"And he took a wallet from his girdle , wherein were bread and pieces of dry bacon , and , while Matcham fell heartily to , struck farther forth among the trees ."
"A little beyond there was a dip in the ground , where a streamlet soaked among dead leaves ; and beyond that , again , the trees were better grown and stood wider , and oak and beech began to take the place of willow and elm ."
"The continued tossing and pouring of the wind among the leaves sufficiently concealed the sounds of his footsteps on the mast ; it was for the ear what a moonless night is to the eye ; but for all that Dick went cautiously , slipping from one big trunk to another , and looking sharply about him as he went ."
"Suddenly a doe passed like a shadow through the underwood in front of him , and he paused , disgusted at the chance ."
"This part of the wood had been certainly deserted , but now that the poor deer had run , she was like a messenger he should have sent before him to announce his coming ; and instead of pushing farther , he turned him to the nearest well-grown tree , and rapidly began to climb ."
Luck had served him well .
"The oak on which he had mounted was one of the tallest in that quarter of the wood , and easily out-topped its neighbours by a fathom and a half ; and when Dick had clambered into the topmost fork and clung there , swinging dizzily in the great wind , he saw behind him the whole fenny plain as far as Kettley , and the Till wandering among woody islets , and in front of him , the white line of high-road winding through the forest ."
The boat had been righted -- it was even now midway on the ferry .
"Beyond that there was no sign of man , nor aught moving but the wind ."
"He was about to descend , when , taking a last view , his eye lit upon a string of moving points about the middle of the fen ."
"Plainly a small troop was threading the causeway , and that at a good pace ; and this gave him some concern as he shinned vigorously down the trunk and returned across the wood for his companion ."
"CHAPTER IV -- A GREENWOOD COMPANY Matcham was well rested and revived ; and the two lads , winged by what Dick had seen , hurried through the remainder of the outwood , crossed the road in safety , and began to mount into the high ground of Tunstall Forest ."
"The trees grew more and more in groves , with heathy places in between , sandy , gorsy , and dotted with old yews ."
"`` I did so , sir , for my sins , '' said I ; `` for it was by his means and the procurement of my uncle , that I was kidnapped within sight of this town , carried to sea , suffered shipwreck and a hundred other hardships , and stand before you to-day in this poor accoutrement . ''"
"`` You say you were shipwrecked , '' said Rankeillor ; `` where was that ? ''"
"`` Off the south end of the Isle of Mull , '' said I. `` The name of the isle on which I was cast up is the Island Earraid . ''"
`` Ah ! ''
"says he , smiling , `` you are deeper than me in the geography ."
"But so far , I may tell you , this agrees pretty exactly with other informations that I hold ."
But you say you were kidnapped ; in what sense ? ''
"`` In the plain meaning of the word , sir , '' said I. `` I was on my way to your house , when I was trepanned on board the brig , cruelly struck down , thrown below , and knew no more of anything till we were far at sea ."
"I was destined for the plantations ; a fate that , in God 's providence , I have escaped . ''"
"`` The brig was lost on June the 27th , '' says he , looking in his book , `` and we are now at August the 24th ."
"Here is a considerable hiatus , Mr. Balfour , of near upon two months ."
It has already caused a vast amount of trouble to your friends ; and I own I shall not be very well contented until it is set right . ''
"`` Indeed , sir , '' said I , `` these months are very easily filled up ; but yet before I told my story , I would be glad to know that I was talking to a friend . ''"
"`` This is to argue in a circle , '' said the lawyer ."
`` I can not be convinced till I have heard you .
I can not be your friend till I am properly informed .
"If you were more trustful , it would better befit your time of life ."
"And you know , Mr. Balfour , we have a proverb in the country that evil-doers are aye evil-dreaders . ''"
"`` You are not to forget , sir , '' said I , `` that I have already suffered by my trustfulness ; and was shipped off to be a slave by the very man that -LRB- if I rightly understand -RRB- is your employer ? ''"
"All this while I had been gaining ground with Mr. Rankeillor , and in proportion as I gained ground , gaining confidence ."
"But at this sally , which I made with something of a smile myself , he fairly laughed aloud ."
"`` No , no , '' said he , `` it is not so bad as that ."
"Fui , non sum ."
"I was indeed your uncle 's man of business ; but while you -LRB- imberbis juvenis custode remoto -RRB- were gallivanting in the west , a good deal of water has run under the bridges ; and if your ears did not sing , it was not for lack of being talked about ."
"On the very day of your sea disaster , Mr. Campbell stalked into my office , demanding you from all the winds ."
I had never heard of your existence ; but I had known your father ; and from matters in my competence -LRB- to be touched upon hereafter -RRB- I was disposed to fear the worst .
"Mr. Ebenezer admitted having seen you ; declared -LRB- what seemed improbable -RRB- that he had given you considerable sums ; and that you had started for the continent of Europe , intending to fulfil your education , which was probable and praiseworthy ."
"Interrogated how you had come to send no word to Mr. Campbell , he deponed that you had expressed a great desire to break with your past life ."
"Further interrogated where you now were , protested ignorance , but believed you were in Leyden ."
That is a close sum of his replies .
"I am not exactly sure that any one believed him , '' continued Mr. Rankeillor with a smile ; `` and in particular he so much disrelished me expressions of mine that -LRB- in a word -RRB- he showed me to the door ."
"We were then at a full stand ; for whatever shrewd suspicions we might entertain , we had no shadow of probation ."
"That was all ; but brief as it was , and to me incomprehensible , it filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight ."
"`` Livesey , '' said the squire , `` you will give up this wretched practice at once ."
Tomorrow I start for Bristol .
In three weeks ' time -- three weeks !
"-- two weeks -- ten days -- we 'll have the best ship , sir , and the choicest crew in England ."
Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy .
"You 'll make a famous cabin-boy , Hawkins ."
"You , Livesey , are ship 's doctor ; I am admiral ."
"We 'll take Redruth , Joyce , and Hunter ."
"We 'll have favourable winds , a quick passage , and not the least difficulty in finding the spot , and money to eat , to roll in , to play duck and drake with ever after . ''"
"`` Trelawney , '' said the doctor , `` I 'll go with you ; and I 'll go bail for it , so will Jim , and be a credit to the undertaking ."
There 's only one man I 'm afraid of . ''
`` And who 's that ? ''
cried the squire .
"`` Name the dog , sir ! ''"
"`` You , '' replied the doctor ; `` for you can not hold your tongue ."
We are not the only men who know of this paper .
"These fellows who attacked the inn tonight -- bold , desperate blades , for sure -- and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger , and more , I dare say , not far off , are , one and all , through thick and thin , bound that they 'll get that money ."
We must none of us go alone till we get to sea .
"Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile ; you 'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol , and from first to last , not one of us must breathe a word of what we 've found . ''"
"`` Livesey , '' returned the squire , `` you are always in the right of it ."
I 'll be as silent as the grave . ''
"PART TWO -- The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea , and none of our first plans -- not even Dr. Livesey 's , of keeping me beside him -- could be carried out as we intended ."
"The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice ; the squire was hard at work at Bristol ; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth , the gamekeeper , almost a prisoner , but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures ."
"I brooded by the hour together over the map , all the details of which I well remembered ."
"Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper 's room , I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction ; I explored every acre of its surface ; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass , and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects ."
"Sometimes the isle was thick with savages , with whom we fought , sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us , but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures ."
"So the weeks passed on , till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey , with this addition , `` To be opened , in the case of his absence , by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins . ''"
"Obeying this order , we found , or rather I found -- for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print -- the following important news : Old Anchor Inn , Bristol , March 1 , 17 -- Dear Livesey -- As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London , I send this in double to both places ."
The ship is bought and fitted .
"She lies at anchor , ready for sea ."
"You never imagined a sweeter schooner -- a child might sail her -- two hundred tons ; name , HISPANIOLA ."
`` Dear life and heart ! ''
"exclaimed Mrs. Emory , pausing in the act of scalding a milk-can when Murray emerged from a side door ."
"`` What on earth is the matter , Mr. Murray ?"
"You ai n't sick now , surely ?"
I told you them pond fogs was p ` isen after night !
"If you 've gone and got -- '' `` Nothing is the matter , dear lady , '' interrupted Murray , `` and I have n't gone and got anything except an acute attack of early rising which is not in the least likely to become chronic ."
"But at what hour of the night do you get up , you wonderful woman ?"
Or rather do you ever go to bed at all ?
"Here is the sun only beginning to rise and -- positively yes , you have all your cows milked . ''"
Mrs. Emory purred with delight .
"`` Folks as has fourteen cows to milk has to rise betimes , '' she answered with proud humility ."
"`` Laws , I do n't complain -- I 've lots of help with the milking ."
"How Mrs. Palmer manages , I really can not comperhend -- or rather , how she has managed ."
I suppose she 'll be all right now since her niece came last night .
I saw her posting to the pond pasture not ten minutes ago .
She 'll have to milk all them seven cows herself .
But dear life and heart !
Here I be palavering away and not a bite of breakfast ready for you ! ''
"`` I do n't want any breakfast until the regular time for it , '' assured Murray ."
`` I 'm going down to the pond to see the sun rise . ''
"`` Now do n't you go and get caught in the ma ` sh , '' anxiously called Mrs. Emory , as she never failed to do when she saw him starting for the pond ."
"Nobody ever had got caught in the marsh , but Mrs. Emory lived in a chronic state of fear lest someone should ."
"`` And if you once got stuck in that black mud you 'd be sucked right down and never seen or heard tell of again till the day of judgment , like Adam Palmer 's cow , '' she was wont to warn her boarders ."
"Murray sought his favourite spot for pond dreaming -- a bloomy corner of the pasture that ran down into the blue water , with a dump of leafy maples on the left ."
He was very glad he had risen early .
A miracle was being worked before his very eyes .
"The world was in a flush and tremor of maiden loveliness , instinct with all the marvellous fleeting charm of girlhood and spring and young morning ."
Overhead the sky was a vast high-sprung arch of unstained crystal .
"Down over the sand dunes , where the pond ran out into the sea , was a great arc of primrose smitten through with auroral crimsonings ."
"Beneath it the pond waters shimmered with a hundred fairy hues , but just before him they were clear as a flawless mirror ."
"The fields around him glistened with dews , and a little wandering wind , blowing lightly from some bourne in the hills , strayed down over the slopes , bringing with it an unimaginable odour and freshness , and fluttered over the pond , leaving a little path of dancing silver ripples across the mirror-glory of the water ."
"Birds were singing in the beech woods over on Orchard Knob Farm , answering to each other from shore to shore , until the very air was tremulous with the elfin music of this wonderful midsummer dawn ."
"`` Then do go to sleep , '' said Nan , pettishly ."
`` I want my own bed .
"Oh , I wish I could see Teddy ! ''"
"cried Rob , painfully reminded of home by the soft chirp of birds safe in their little nests ."
"`` I do n't believe your mother will ever find us , '' said Nan , who was becoming desperate , for she hated patient waiting of any sort ."
`` It 's so dark she wo n't see us . ''
"`` It was all black in the ice-house , and I was so scared I did n't call her , but she saw me ; and she will see me now , no matter how dark it is , '' returned confiding Rob , standing up to peer into the gloom for the help which never failed him ."
`` I see her !
I see her ! ''
"he cried , and ran as fast as his tired legs would take him toward a dark figure slowly approaching ."
"Suddenly he stopped , then turned about , and came stumbling back , screaming in a great panic , `` No , it 's a bear , a big black one ! ''"
and hid his face in Nan 's skirts .
"For a moment Nan quailed ; ever her courage gave out at the thought of a real bear , and she was about to turn and flee in great disorder , when a mild `` Moo ! ''"
"changed her fear to merriment , as she said , laughing , `` It 's a cow , Robby !"
"the nice , black cow we saw this afternoon . ''"
"The cow seemed to feel that it was not just the thing to meet two little people in her pasture after dark , and the amiable beast paused to inquire into the case ."
"She let them stroke her , and stood regarding them with her soft eyes so mildly , that Nan , who feared no animal but a bear , was fired with a desire to milk her ."
"`` Silas taught me how ; and berries and milk would be so nice , '' she said , emptying the contents of her pail into her hat , and boldly beginning her new task , while Rob stood by and repeated , at her command , the poem from Mother Goose : `` Cushy cow , bonny , let down your milk , Let down your milk to me , And I will give you a gown of silk , A gown of silk and a silver tee . ''"
"But the immortal rhyme had little effect , for the benevolent cow had already been milked , and had only half a gill to give the thirsty children ."
`` Shoo !
get away !
"you are an old cross patch , '' cried Nan , ungratefully , as she gave up the attempt in despair ; and poor Molly walked on with a gentle gurgle of surprise and reproof ."
"`` Each can have a sip , and then we must take a walk ."
We shall go to sleep if we do n't ; and lost people must n't sleep .
Do n't you know how Hannah Lee in the pretty story slept under the snow and died ? ''
"`` But there is n't any snow now , and it 's nice and warm , '' said Rob , who was not blessed with as lively a fancy as Nan ."
"`` No matter , we will poke about a little , and call some more ; and then , if nobody comes , we will hide under the bushes , like Hop - ` o-my-thumb and his brothers . ''"
"It was a very short walk , however , for Rob was so sleepy he could not get on , and tumbled down so often that Nan entirely lost patience , being half distracted by the responsibility she had taken upon herself ."
"`` If you tumble down again , I 'll shake you , '' she said , lifting the poor little man up very kindly as she spoke , for Nan 's bark was much worse than her bite ."
`` Please do n't .
"It 's my boots they keep slipping so ; '' and Rob manfully checked the sob just ready to break out , adding , with a plaintive patience that touched Nan 's heart , `` If the skeeters did n't bite me so , I could go to sleep till Marmar comes . ''"
"`` Put your head on my lap , and I 'll cover you up with my apron ; I 'm not afraid of the night , '' said Nan , sitting down and trying to persuade herself that she did not mind the shadow nor the mysterious rustlings all about her ."
"Alan wrote it , putting all thought of Lynde Oliver sternly out of his mind for the time being ."
He had no notion of falling in love with her .
He knew nothing of love and imagined that it counted for nothing in his life .
"He admitted that his curiosity was aflame about the girl , but it never occurred to him that she meant or could mean anything to him but an attractive enigma which once solved would lose its attraction ."
"The young women he knew in Rexton , whose simple , pleasant friendship he valued , had the placid , domestic charm of their own sweet-breathed , windless orchards ."
"Lynde Oliver had the fascination of the lake shore -- wild , remote , untamed -- the lure of the wilderness and the primitive ."
"There was nothing more personal in his thought of her , and yet when he recalled Isabel King 's sneer he felt an almost personal resentment ."
* * * * * During the following fortnight Alan made many trips to the shore -- and he always went by the branch road to the Four Winds point .
He did not attempt to conceal from himself that he hoped to meet Lynde Oliver again .
In this he was unsuccessful .
Sometimes he saw her at a distance along the shore but she always disappeared as soon as seen .
"Occasionally as he crossed the point he saw her working in her garden but he never went very near the house , feeling that he had no right to spy on it or her in any way ."
He soon became convinced that she avoided him purposely and the conviction piqued him .
He felt an odd masterful desire to meet her face to face and make her look at him .
Sometimes he called himself a fool and vowed he would go no more to the Four Winds shore .
Yet he inevitably went .
He did not find in the shore the comfort and inspiration he had formerly found .
"Something had come between his soul and the soul of the wilderness -- something he did not recognize or formulate -- a nameless , haunting longing that shaped itself about the memory of a cold sweet face and starry , indifferent eyes , grey as the lake at dawn ."
"Of Captain Anthony he never got even a glimpse , but he saw the old cousin several times , going and coming about the yard and its environs ."
"Finally one day he met her , coming up a path which led to a spring down in a firry hollow ."
She was carrying two heavy pails of water and Alan asked permission to help her .
"He half expected a repulse , for the tall , grim old woman had a rather stern and forbidding look , but after gazing at him a moment in a somewhat scrutinizing manner she said briefly , `` You may , if you like . ''"
"Alan took the pails and followed her , the path not being wide enough for two ."
"She strode on before him at a rapid , vigorous pace until they came out into the yard by the house ."
Alan felt his heart beating foolishly .
Would he see Lynde Oliver ?
"Would -- `` You may carry the water there , '' the old woman said , pointing to a little outhouse near the pines ."
`` I 'm washing -- the spring water is softer than the well water .
Thank you '' -- as Alan set the pails down on a bench -- `` I 'm not so young as I was and bringing the water so far tires me .
Lynde always brings it for me when she 's home . ''
"She stood before him in the narrow doorway , blocking his exit , and looked at him with keen , deep-set dark eyes ."
"In spite of her withered aspect and wrinkled face , she was not an uncomely old woman and there was about her a dignity of carriage and manner that pleased Alan ."
"My eyes turned instinctively in that direction , and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine ."
"What it was , whether bear or man or monkey , I could in no wise tell ."
It seemed dark and shaggy ; more I knew not .
But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand .
"I was now , it seemed , cut off upon both sides ; behind me the murderers , before me this lurking nondescript ."
And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not .
"Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods , and I turned on my heel , and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder , began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats ."
"Instantly the figure reappeared , and making a wide circuit , began to head me off ."
"I was tired , at any rate ; but had I been as fresh as when I rose , I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary ."
"From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer , running manlike on two legs , but unlike any man that I had ever seen , stooping almost double as it ran ."
"Yet a man it was , I could no longer be in doubt about that ."
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals .
I was within an ace of calling for help .
"But the mere fact that he was a man , however wild , had somewhat reassured me , and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion ."
"I stood still , therefore , and cast about for some method of escape ; and as I was so thinking , the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind ."
"As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless , courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him ."
"He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk ; but he must have been watching me closely , for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me ."
"Then he hesitated , drew back , came forward again , and at last , to my wonder and confusion , threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication ."
At that I once more stopped .
`` Who are you ? ''
I asked .
"`` Ben Gunn , '' he answered , and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward , like a rusty lock ."
"`` I 'm poor Ben Gunn , I am ; and I have n't spoke with a Christian these three years . ''"
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing .
"His skin , wherever it was exposed , was burnt by the sun ; even his lips were black , and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face ."
"Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied , he was the chief for raggedness ."
"He was clothed with tatters of old ship 's canvas and old sea-cloth , and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings , brass buttons , bits of stick , and loops of tarry gaskin ."
"About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt , which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement ."
`` Three years ! ''
I cried .
`` Were you shipwrecked ? ''
"`` Nay , mate , '' said he ; `` marooned . ''"
"When that is done , come to us and we will give you further directions . ' '"
"I will obey you in everything , dear brothers , ' answered Lyman ; and so she did ."
"It had happened that on this very evening the Stalos had driven in some of the reindeer from the pasture , and had tied them up to the wall of the house so that they might be handy to kill for next day 's dinner ."
"The two Sodnos had seen what they were doing , and where the beasts were secured ; so , at midnight , when all was still , they crept down from their tree and seized the reindeer by the horns which were locked together ."
"The animals were frightened , and began to neigh and kick , as if they were fighting together , and the noise became so great that even the eldest Stalo was awakened by it , and that was a thing which had never occurred before ."
"Raising himself in his bed , he called to his youngest brother to go out and separate the reindeer or they would certainly kill themselves ."
"The young Stalo did as he was bid , and left the house ; but no sooner was he out of the door than he was stabbed to the heart by one of the Sodnos , and fell without a groan ."
"Then they went back to worry the reindeer , and the noise became as great as ever , and a second time the Stalo awoke ."
"` The boy does not seem to be able to part the beasts , ' he cried to his second brother ; ` go and help him , or I shall never get to sleep . '"
"So the brother went , and in an instant was struck dead as he left the house by the sword of the eldest Sodno ."
"The Stalo waited in bed a little longer for things to get quiet , but as the clatter of the reindeer 's horns was as bad as ever , he rose angrily from his bed muttering to himself : ` It is extraordinary that they can not unlock themselves ; but as no one else seems able to help them I suppose I must go and do it . '"
"Rubbing his eyes , he stood up on the floor and stretched his great arms and gave a yawn which shook the walls ."
"The Sodnos heard it below , and posted themselves , one at the big door and one at the little door at the back , for they did not know what their enemy would come out at ."
"The Stalo put out his hand to take his iron mantle from the bed , where it always lay , but the mantle was no there ."
"He wondered where it could be , and who could have moved it , and after searching through all the rooms , he found it hanging over the kitchen fire ."
"But the first touch burnt him so badly that he let it alone , and went with nothing , except a stick in his hand , through the back door ."
"The young Sodno was standing ready for him , and as the Stalo passed the threshold struck him such a blow on the head that he rolled over with a crash and never stirred again ."
"The two Sodnos did not trouble about him , but quickly stripped the younger Stalos of their clothes , in which they dressed themselves ."
Then they sat still till the dawn should break and they could find out from the Stalos ' mother where the treasure was hidden .
With the first rays of the sun the young Sodno went upstairs and entered the old woman 's room .
"She was already up and dressed , and sitting by the window knitting , and the young man crept in softly and crouched down on the floor , laying his head on her lap ."
"For a while he kept silence , then he whispered gently : ` Tell me , dear mother , where did my eldest brother conceal his riches ? '"
` What a strange question !
"Surely you must know , ' answered she ."
"` No , I have forgotten ; my memory is so bad . '"
"` He dug a hole under the doorstep and placed it there , ' said she ."
And there was another pause .
By-and-by the Sodno asked again : ` And where may my second brother 's money be ? '
` Do n't you know that either ? '
cried the mother in surprise .
"` Oh , yes ; I did once ."
But since I fell upon my head I can remember nothing . '
But I am still waiting your opinion . ''
I am sure if ever Cluny hated any man it was David Balfour .
"He looked me all over with a warlike eye , and I saw the challenge at his lips ."
"But either my youth disarmed him , or perhaps his own sense of justice ."
"Certainly it was a mortifying matter for all concerned , and not least Cluny ; the more credit that he took it as he did ."
"`` Mr. Balfour , '' said he , `` I think you are too nice and covenanting , but for all that you have the spirit of a very pretty gentleman ."
"Upon my honest word , ye may take this money -- it 's what I would tell my son -- and here 's my hand along with it ! ''"
"CHAPTER XXIV THE FLIGHT IN THE HEATHER : THE QUARREL Alan and I were put across Loch Errocht under cloud of night , and went down its eastern shore to another hiding-place near the head of Loch Rannoch , whither we were led by one of the gillies from the Cage ."
"This fellow carried all our luggage and Alan 's great-coat in the bargain , trotting along under the burthen , far less than the half of which used to weigh me to the ground , like a stout hill pony with a feather ; yet he was a man that , in plain contest , I could have broken on my knee ."
"Doubtless it was a great relief to walk disencumbered ; and perhaps without that relief , and the consequent sense of liberty and lightness , I could not have walked at all ."
"I was but new risen from a bed of sickness ; and there was nothing in the state of our affairs to hearten me for much exertion ; travelling , as we did , over the most dismal deserts in Scotland , under a cloudy heaven , and with divided hearts among the travellers ."
"For long , we said nothing ; marching alongside or one behind the other , each with a set countenance : I , angry and proud , and drawing what strength I had from these two violent and sinful feelings ; Alan angry and ashamed , ashamed that he had lost my money , angry that I should take it so ill ."
"The thought of a separation ran always the stronger in my mind ; and the more I approved of it , the more ashamed I grew of my approval ."
"It would be a fine , handsome , generous thing , indeed , for Alan to turn round and say to me : `` Go , I am in the most danger , and my company only increases yours . ''"
"But for me to turn to the friend who certainly loved me , and say to him : `` You are in great danger , I am in but little ; your friendship is a burden ; go , take your risks and bear your hardships alone -- '' no , that was impossible ; and even to think of it privily to myself , made my cheeks to burn ."
"And yet Alan had behaved like a child , and -LRB- what is worse -RRB- a treacherous child ."
"Wheedling my money from me while I lay half-conscious was scarce better than theft ; and yet here he was trudging by my side , without a penny to his name , and by what I could see , quite blithe to sponge upon the money he had driven me to beg ."
"True , I was ready to share it with him ; but it made me rage to see him count upon my readiness ."
These were the two things uppermost in my mind ; and I could open my mouth upon neither without black ungenerosity .
"So I did the next worst , and said nothing , nor so much as looked once at my companion , save with the tail of my eye ."
"At last , upon the other side of Loch Errocht , going over a smooth , rushy place , where the walking was easy , he could bear it no longer , and came close to me ."
"`` David , '' says he , `` this is no way for two friends to take a small accident ."
I have to say that I 'm sorry ; and so that 's said .
"And now if you have anything , ye 'd better say it . ''"
"`` O , '' says I , `` I have nothing . ''"
He seemed disconcerted ; at which I was meanly pleased .
"`` No , '' said he , with rather a trembling voice , `` but when I say I was to blame ? ''"
"`` Why , of course , ye were to blame , '' said I , coolly ; `` and you will bear me out that I have never reproached you . ''"
"`` Never , '' says he ; `` but ye ken very well that ye 've done worse ."
Are we to part ?
Ye said so once before .
Are ye to say it again ?
He was all her own and she knew that he found strength and comfort in her sympathy and understanding .
"It was very wonderful to know she meant so much to him -- the knowledge helped her through moments that would otherwise have been unendurable , and gave her power to smile -- and even to laugh a little ."
"When Walter had gone she might indulge in the comfort of tears , but not while he was here ."
"She would not even let herself cry at night , lest her eyes should betray her to him in the morning ."
"On his last evening at home they went together to Rainbow Valley and sat down on the bank of the brook , under the White Lady , where the gay revels of olden days had been held in the cloudless years ."
"Rainbow Valley was roofed over with a sunset of unusual splendour that night ; a wonderful grey dusk just touched with starlight followed it ; and then came moonshine , hinting , hiding , revealing , lighting up little dells and hollows here , leaving others in dark , velvet shadow ."
"`` When I am ` somewhere in France , ' '' said Walter , looking around him with eager eyes on all the beauty his soul loved , `` I shall remember these still , dewy , moon-drenched places ."
The balsam of the fir-trees ; the peace of those white pools of moonshine ; the ` strength of the hills ' -- what a beautiful old Biblical phrase that is .
Rilla !
"Look at those old hills around us -- the hills we looked up at as children , wondering what lay for us in the great world beyond them ."
How calm and strong they are -- how patient and changeless -- like the heart of a good woman .
"Rilla-my-Rilla , do you know what you have been to me the past year ?"
I want to tell you before I go .
"I could not have lived through it if it had not been for you , little loving , believing heart . ''"
Rilla dared not try to speak .
She slipped her hand into Walter 's and pressed it hard .
"`` And when I 'm over there , Rilla , in that hell upon earth which men who have forgotten God have made , it will be the thought of you that will help me most ."
I know you 'll be as plucky and patient as you have shown yourself to be this past year -- I 'm not afraid for you .
"I know that no matter what happens , you 'll be Rilla-my-Rilla -- no matter what happens . ''"
"Rilla repressed tear and sigh , but she could not repress a little shiver , and Walter knew that he had said enough ."
"After a moment of silence , in which each made an unworded promise to each other , he said , `` Now we wo n't be sober any more ."
We 'll look beyond the years -- to the time when the war will be over and Jem and Jerry and I will come marching home and we 'll all be happy again . ''
"`` We wo n't be -- happy -- in the same way , '' said Rilla ."
"`` No , not in the same way ."
Nobody whom this war has touched will ever be happy again in quite the same way .
"But it will be a better happiness , I think , little sister -- a happiness we 've earned ."
"We were very happy before the war , were n't we ?"
"With a home like Ingleside , and a father and mother like ours we could n't help being happy ."
But that happiness was a gift from life and love ; it was n't really ours -- life could take it back at any time .
It can never take away the happiness we win for ourselves in the way of duty .
I 've realised that since I went into khaki .
"In spite of my occasional funks , when I fall to living over things beforehand , I 've been happy since that night in May ."
"`` Consider , '' cried Mrs. Finch , `` that when water gets into the nest it remains there and your little ones are drowned . ''"
"The thrushes begged Solomon with a look to say something crushing in reply to this , but again he was perplexed ."
"`` Try another drink , '' suggested Mrs. Finch pertly ."
"Kate was her name , and all Kates are saucy ."
"Solomon did try another drink , and it inspired him ."
"`` If , '' said he , `` a finch 's nest is placed on the Serpentine it fills and breaks to pieces , but a thrush 's nest is still as dry as the cup of a swan 's back . ''"
How the thrushes applauded !
"Now they knew why they lined their nests with mud , and when Mrs. Finch called out , `` We do n't place our nests on the Serpentine , '' they did what they should have done at first : chased her from the meeting ."
After this it was most orderly .
"What they had been brought together to hear , said Solomon , was this : their young friend , Peter Pan , as they well knew , wanted very much to be able to cross to the Gardens , and he now proposed , with their help , to build a boat ."
"At this the thrushes began to fidget , which made Peter tremble for his scheme ."
Solomon explained hastily that what he meant was not one of the cumbrous boats that humans use ; the proposed boat was to be simply a thrush 's nest large enough to hold Peter .
"But still , to Peter 's agony , the thrushes were sulky ."
"`` We are very busy people , '' they grumbled , `` and this would be a big job . ''"
"`` Quite so , '' said Solomon , `` and , of course , Peter would not allow you to work for nothing ."
"You must remember that he is now in comfortable circumstances , and he will pay you such wages as you have never been paid before ."
Peter Pan authorises me to say that you shall all be paid sixpence a day . ''
"Then all the thrushes hopped for joy , and that very day was begun the celebrated Building of the Boat ."
All their ordinary business fell into arrears .
"It was the time of year when they should have been pairing , but not a thrush 's nest was built except this big one , and so Solomon soon ran short of thrushes with which to supply the demand from the mainland ."
"The stout , rather greedy children , who look so well in perambulators but get puffed easily when they walk , were all young thrushes once , and ladies often ask specially for them ."
What do you think Solomon did ?
He sent over to the housetops for a lot of sparrows and ordered them to lay their eggs in old thrushes ' nests and sent their young to the ladies and swore they were all thrushes !
"It was known afterward on the island as the Sparrows ' Year , and so , when you meet , as you doubtless sometimes do , grown-up people who puff and blow as if they thought themselves bigger than they are , very likely they belong to that year ."
You ask them .
"Peter was a just master , and paid his work-people every evening ."
"They stood in rows on the branches , waiting politely while he cut the paper sixpences out of his bank-note , and presently he called the roll , and then each bird , as the names were mentioned , flew down and got sixpence ."
It must have been a fine sight .
"And at last , after months of labor , the boat was finished ."
"Oh , the deportment of Peter as he saw it growing more and more like a great thrush 's nest !"
"From the very beginning of the building of it he slept by its side , and often woke up to say sweet things to it , and after it was lined with mud and the mud had dried he always slept in it ."
"He sleeps in his nest still , and has a fascinating way of curling round in it , for it is just large enough to hold him comfortably when he curls round like a kitten ."
`` Wo n't it cost a great deal ? ''
"asked Merry , who , in spite of her little elegancies , had a good deal of her thrifty mother 's common sense ."
`` Yes ; and I 've got to earn it .
"But I can -- I know I can , for I 've saved some , and I shall work like ten beavers all summer ."
"I wo n't borrow if I can help it , but I know someone who would lend me five hundred if I wanted it ; '' and Ralph looked as eager and secure as if the earning of twice that sum was a mere trifle when all the longing of his life was put into his daily tasks ."
`` I wish I had it to give you .
It must be so splendid to feel that you can do great things if you only have the chance .
"And to travel , and see all the lovely pictures and statues , and people and places in Italy ."
How happy you must be ! ''
and Merry 's eyes had the wistful look they always wore when she dreamed dreams of the world she loved to live in .
`` I am -- so happy that I 'm afraid it never will happen .
"If I do go , I 'll write and tell you all about the fine sights , and how I get on ."
Would you like me to ? ''
"asked Ralph , beginning enthusiastically and ending rather bashfully , for he admired Merry very much , and was not quite sure how this proposal would be received ."
`` Indeed I should !
"I 'd feel so grand to have letters from Paris and Rome , and you 'd have so much to tell it would be almost as good as going myself , '' she said , looking off into the daffodil sky , as they paused a minute on the hill-top to get breath , for both had walked as fast as they talked ."
`` And will you answer the letters ? ''
"asked Ralph , watching the innocent face , which looked unusually kind and beautiful to him in that soft light ."
"`` Why , yes ; I 'd love to , only I shall not have anything interesting to say ."
What can I write about ? ''
and Merry smiled as she thought how dull her letters would sound after the exciting details his would doubtless give .
"`` Write about yourself , and all the rest of the people I know ."
"Grandma will be gone , and I shall want to hear how you get on . ''"
"Ralph looked very anxious indeed to hear , and Merry promised she would tell all about the other people , adding , as she turned from the evening peace and loveliness to the house , whence came the clatter of milk-pans and the smell of cooking , -- `` I never should have anything very nice to tell about myself , for I do n't do interesting things as you do , and you would n't care to hear about school , and sewing , and messing round at home . ''"
"Merry gave a disdainful little sniff at the savory perfume of ham which saluted them , and paused with her hand on the gate , as if she found it pleasanter out there than in the house ."
"Ralph seemed to agree with her , for , leaning on the gate , he lingered to say , with real sympathy in his tone and something else in his face , `` Yes , I should ; so you write and tell me all about it ."
"I did n't know you had any worries , for you always seemed like one of the happiest people in the world , with so many to pet and care for you , and plenty of money , and nothing very hard or hateful to do ."
"You 'd think you were well off if you knew as much about poverty and work and never getting what you want , as I do . ''"
`` You bear your worries so well that nobody knows you have them .
"I ought not to complain , and I wo n't , for I do have all I need ."
"I 'm so glad you are going to get what you want at last ; '' and Merry held out her hand to say good-night , with so much pleasure in her face that Ralph could not make up his mind to go just yet ."
"`` I shall have to scratch round in a lively way before I do get it , for David says a fellow ca n't live on less than four or five hundred a year , even living as poor artists have to , in garrets and on crusts ."
"`` Troth , no ! ''"
"And he laid hold upon the packet and retired into the barn to shift himself , recommending me in the meanwhile to his kinsman ."
"James carried me accordingly into the kitchen , and sat down with me at table , smiling and talking at first in a very hospitable manner ."
"But presently the gloom returned upon him ; he sat frowning and biting his fingers ; only remembered me from time to time ; and then gave me but a word or two and a poor smile , and back into his private terrors ."
"His wife sat by the fire and wept , with her face in her hands ; his eldest son was crouched upon the floor , running over a great mass of papers and now and again setting one alight and burning it to the bitter end ; all the while a servant lass with a red face was rummaging about the room , in a blind hurry of fear , and whimpering as she went ; and every now and again one of the men would thrust in his face from the yard , and cry for orders ."
"At last James could keep his seat no longer , and begged my permission to be so unmannerly as walk about ."
"`` I am but poor company altogether , sir , '' says he , `` but I can think of nothing but this dreadful accident , and the trouble it is like to bring upon quite innocent persons . ''"
A little after he observed his son burning a paper which he thought should have been kept ; and at that his excitement burst out so that it was painful to witness .
He struck the lad repeatedly .
`` Are you gone gyte ? ''
* he cried .
`` Do you wish to hang your father ? ''
"and forgetful of my presence , carried on at him a long time together in the Gaelic , the young man answering nothing ; only the wife , at the name of hanging , throwing her apron over her face and sobbing out louder than before ."
* Mad .
"This was all wretched for a stranger like myself to hear and see ; and I was right glad when Alan returned , looking like himself in his fine French clothes , though -LRB- to be sure -RRB- they were now grown almost too battered and withered to deserve the name of fine ."
"I was then taken out in my turn by another of the sons , and given that change of clothing of which I had stood so long in need , and a pair of Highland brogues made of deer-leather , rather strange at first , but after a little practice very easy to the feet ."
"By the time I came back Alan must have told his story ; for it seemed understood that I was to fly with him , and they were all busy upon our equipment ."
"They gave us each a sword and pistols , though I professed my inability to use the former ; and with these , and some ammunition , a bag of oatmeal , an iron pan , and a bottle of right French brandy , we were ready for the heather ."
"Money , indeed , was lacking ."
"I had about two guineas left ; Alan 's belt having been despatched by another hand , that trusty messenger had no more than seventeen-pence to his whole fortune ; and as for James , it appears he had brought himself so low with journeys to Edinburgh and legal expenses on behalf of the tenants , that he could only scrape together three-and-five-pence-halfpenny , the most of it in coppers ."
"`` This 'll no do , '' said Alan ."
"`` Ye must find a safe bit somewhere near by , '' said James , `` and get word sent to me ."
"Ye see , ye 'll have to get this business prettily off , Alan ."
This is no time to be stayed for a guinea or two .
"They 're sure to get wind of ye , sure to seek ye , and by my way of it , sure to lay on ye the wyte of this day 's accident ."
"If it falls on you , it falls on me that am your near kinsman and harboured ye while ye were in the country ."
"And if it comes on me -- '' he paused , and bit his fingers , with a white face ."
"`` It would be a painful thing for our friends if I was to hang , '' said he ."
"`` It would be an ill day for Appin , '' says Alan ."
"`` It 's a day that sticks in my throat , '' said James ."
"`` O man , man , man -- man Alan !"
you and me have spoken like two fools ! ''
"`` Well , I reckon it 's about the blessed same to me , shipmate , '' he replied ; `` so it 's strong , and plenty of it , what 's the odds ? ''"
"`` All right , '' I answered ."
"`` I 'll bring you port , Mr. Hands ."
But I 'll have to dig for it . ''
"With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could , slipped off my shoes , ran quietly along the sparred gallery , mounted the forecastle ladder , and popped my head out of the fore companion ."
"I knew he would not expect to see me there , yet I took every precaution possible , and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true ."
"He had risen from his position to his hands and knees , and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved -- for I could hear him stifle a groan -- yet it was at a good , rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck ."
"In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked , out of a coil of rope , a long knife , or rather a short dirk , discoloured to the hilt with blood ."
"He looked upon it for a moment , thrusting forth his under jaw , tried the point upon his hand , and then , hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket , trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark ."
This was all that I required to know .
"Israel could move about , he was now armed , and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me , it was plain that I was meant to be the victim ."
"What he would do afterwards -- whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom , trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him -- was , of course , more than I could say ."
"Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point , since in that our interests jumped together , and that was in the disposition of the schooner ."
"We both desired to have her stranded safe enough , in a sheltered place , and so that , when the time came , she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be ; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared ."
"While I was thus turning the business over in my mind , I had not been idle with my body ."
"I had stolen back to the cabin , slipped once more into my shoes , and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine , and now , with this for an excuse , I made my reappearance on the deck ."
"Hands lay as I had left him , all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light ."
"He looked up , however , at my coming , knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often , and took a good swig , with his favourite toast of `` Here 's luck ! ''"
"Then he lay quiet for a little , and then , pulling out a stick of tobacco , begged me to cut him a quid ."
"`` Cut me a junk o ' that , '' says he , `` for I have n't no knife and hardly strength enough , so be as I had ."
"Ah , Jim , Jim , I reckon I 've missed stays !"
"Cut me a quid , as 'll likely be the last , lad , for I 'm for my long home , and no mistake . ''"
"`` Well , '' said I , `` I 'll cut you some tobacco , but if I was you and thought myself so badly , I would go to my prayers like a Christian man . ''"
`` Why ? ''
said he .
"`` Now , you tell me why . ''"
`` Why ? ''
I cried .
`` You were asking me just now about the dead .
"You 've broken your trust ; you 've lived in sin and lies and blood ; there 's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment , and you ask me why !"
"For God 's mercy , Mr. Hands , that 's why . ''"
"I spoke with a little heat , thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed , in his ill thoughts , to end me with ."
"As soon as he saw this proclamation the boy called his sister , and they hastened to the palace ."
"The bird was buttoned inside his tunic , but , as might have been expected , the courtiers barred the way , and told the child that he could not enter ."
"It was in vain that the boy declared that he was only obeying the king 's commands ; the courtiers only replied that his majesty was not yet out of bed , and it was forbidden to wake him ."
"They were still talking , when , suddenly , the bird settled the question by flying upwards through an open window into the king 's own room ."
"Alighting on the pillow , close to the king 's head , she bowed respectfully , and said : ` My lord , I am the Bird of Truth whom you wished to see , and I have been obliged to approach you in the manner because the boy who brought me is kept out of the palace by your courtiers . '"
"` They shall pay for their insolence , ' said the king ."
"And he instantly ordered one of his attendants to conduct the boy at once to his apartments ; and in a moment more the prince entered , holding his sister by the hand ."
` Who are you ? '
asked the king ; ` and what has the Bird of Truth to do with you ? '
"` If it please your majesty , the Bird of Truth will explain that herself , ' answered the boy ."
And the bird did explain ; and the king heard for the first time of the wicked plot that had been successful for so many years .
"He took his children in his arms , with tears in his eyes , and hurried off with them to the tower in the mountains where the queen was shut up ."
"The poor woman was as white as marble , for she had been living almost in darkness ; but when she saw her husband and children , the colour came back to her face , and she was as beautiful as ever ."
"They all returned in state to the city , where great rejoicings were held ."
"The wicked courtiers had their heads cut off , and all their property was taken away ."
"As for the good old couple , they were given riches and honour , and were loved and cherished to the end of their lives ."
"The Mink and the Wolf -LSB- From Cuentos , Oraciones y Adivinas , por Fernan Caballero . -RSB-"
In a big forest in the north of America lived a quantity of wild animals of all sorts .
"They were always very polite when they met ; but , in spite of that , they kept a close watch one upon the other , as each was afraid of being killed and eaten by somebody else ."
But their manners were so good that no one would ever had guessed that .
"One day a smart young wolf went out to hunt , promising his grandfather and grandmother that he would be sure to be back before bedtime ."
"He trotted along quite happily through the forest till he came to a favourite place of his , just where the river runs into the sea ."
"There , just as he had hoped , he saw the chief mink fishing in a canoe . '"
"I want to fish too , ' cried the wolf ."
But the mink said nothing and pretended not to hear . '
I wish you would take me into your boat ! '
"shouted the wolf , louder than before , and he continued to beseech the mink so long that at last he grew tired of it , and paddled to the shore close enough for the wolf to jump in ."
"` Sit down quietly at that end or we shall be upset , ' said the mink ; ` and if you care about sea-urchins ' eggs , you will find plenty in that basket ."
"But be sure you eat only the white ones , for the red ones would kill you . '"
"So the wolf , who was always hungry , began to eat the eggs greedily ; and when he had finished he told the mink he thought he would have a nap ."
"` Well , then , stretch yourself out , and rest your head on that piece of wood , ' said the mink ."
"And the wolf did as he was bid , and was soon fast asleep ."
Hook -RSB- .
Instant obedience was the only safe thing .
Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings .
"The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy 's suspicions , but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready , which , against her will , she was making for him out of some of Hook 's wickedest garments ."
"It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook 's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched , all but for the forefinger , which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook ."
"Instead of watching the ship , however , we must now return to that desolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago ."
It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time ; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us .
"If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her , she would probably have cried , `` Do n't be silly ; what do I matter ?"
Do go back and keep an eye on the children . ''
So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them ; and they may lay to -LSB- bet on -RSB- that .
Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home ; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening .
We are no more than servants .
"Why on earth should their beds be properly aired , seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry ?"
Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country ?
It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them ; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us .
"One thing I should like to do immensely , and that is to tell her , in the way authors have , that the children are coming back , that indeed they will be here on Thursday week ."
This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward .
"They have been planning it out on the ship : mother 's rapture , father 's shout of joy , Nana 's leap through the air to embrace them first , when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding ."
"How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance ; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth , and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly , `` Dash it all , here are those boys again . ''"
"However , we should get no thanks even for this ."
"We are beginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time , and may be sure that she would upbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure ."
"`` But , my dear madam , it is ten days till Thursday week ; so that by telling you what 's what , we can save you ten days of unhappiness . ''"
"`` Yes , but at what a cost !"
By depriving the children of ten minutes of delight . ''
"`` Oh , if you look at it in that way ! ''"
`` What other way is there in which to look at it ? ''
"You see , the woman had no proper spirit ."
"I had meant to say extraordinarily nice things about her ; but I despise her , and not one of them will I say now ."
"She does not really need to be told to have things ready , for they are ready ."
"All the beds are aired , and she never leaves the house , and observe , the window is open ."
"For all the use we are to her , we might well go back to the ship ."
"However , as we are here we may as well stay and look on ."
"` Well , I was tired of stooping for the sticks , and was leaning against a tree to rest , when I heard a noise of ` sh - ` sh , among the dead leaves ."
"I thought perhaps it was a wolf , so I stood very still ."
But soon there came past a tall man -- oh !
"twice as tall as father -- with a long red beard and a red tunic fastened with a silver girdle , from which hung a silver-handled knife ."
"Behind him followed a great dog , which looked stronger than any wolf , or even a bear ."
"But why are you so pale , mother ? '"
"` It was the Stalo , ' replied she , her voice trembling ; ` Stalo the man-eater !"
"You did well to hide , or you might never had come back ."
"But , remember that , though he is so tall and strong , he is very stupid , and many a Lapp has escaped from his clutches by playing him some clever trick . '"
"Not long after the mother and son had held this talk , it began to be whispered in the forest that the children of an old man called Patto had vanished one by one , no one knew whither ."
"The unhappy father searched the country for miles round without being able to find as much as a shoe or a handkerchief , to show him where they had passed , but at length a little boy came with news that he had seen the Stalo hiding behind a well , near which the children used to play ."
"The boy had waited behind a clump of bushes to see what would happen , and by-and-by he noticed that the Stalo had laid a cunning trap in the path to the well , and that anybody who fell over it would roll into the water and drown there ."
"And , as he watched , Patto 's youngest daughter ran gaily down the path , till her foot caught in the strings that were stretched across the steepest place ."
"She slipped and fell , and in another instant had rolled into the water within reach of the Stalo ."
"As soon as Patto heard this tale his heart was filled with rage , and he vowed to have his revenge ."
"So he straightway took an old fur coat from the hook where it hung , and putting it on went out into the forest ."
"When he reached the path that led to the well he looked hastily round to be sure that no one was watching him , then laid himself down as if he had been caught in the snare and had rolled into the well , though he took care to keep his head out of the water ."
"Very soon he heard a ` sh - ` sh of the leaves , and there was the Stalo pushing his way through the undergrowth to see what chance he had of a dinner ."
"At the first glimpse of Patto 's head in the well he laughed loudly , crying : ` Ha !"
ha !
This time it is the old ass !
I wonder how he will taste ? '
"And drawing Patto out of the well , he flung him across his shoulders and carried him home ."
"Then he tied a cord round him and hung him over the fire to roast , while he finished a box that he was making before the door of the hut , which he meant to hold Patto 's flesh when it was cooked ."
"In a very short time the box was so nearly done that it only wanted a little more chipping out with an axe ; but this part of the work was easier accomplished indoors , and he called to one of his sons who were lounging inside to bring him the tool ."
"The young man looked everywhere , but he could not find the axe , for the very good reason that Patto had managed to pick it up and hide it in his clothes ."
` Stupid fellow !
what is the use of you ? '
"grumbled his father angrily ; and he bade first one and then another of his sons to fetch him the tool , but they had no better success than their brother . '"
"I must come myself , I suppose ! '"
"said Stalo , putting aside the box ."
"But , meanwhile , Patto had slipped from the hook and concealed himself behind the door , so that , as Stalo stepped in , his prisoner raised the axe , and with one blow the ogre 's head was rolling on the ground ."
"` Spare me a morsel , Ardan son of Gorla , ' asked a raven , fluttering down towards him ."
"` Seek food elsewhere , O bearer of ill-news , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ` it is but little I have for myself . '"
"And he stretched himself out for a few moments , then rose to his feet again ."
"On and on went he till the little birds flew to their nests , and the brightness died out of the sky , and a darkness fell over the earth ."
"On and on , and on , till at last he saw a beam of light streaming from a house and hastened towards it ."
"The door was opened and he entered , but paused when he beheld an old man lying on a bench by the fire , while seated opposite him was a maiden combing out the locks of her golden hair with a comb of silver ."
"` Welcome , fair youth , ' said the old man , turning his head ."
"` Sit down and warm yourself , and tell me how fares the outer world ."
It is long since I have seen it . '
"` All my news is that I am seeking service , ' answered Ardan son of Gorla ; ' I have come from far since sunrise , and glad was I to see the rays of your lamp stream into the darkness . ' '"
"I need someone to herd my three dun cows , which are hornless , ' said the old man ."
"` If , for the space of a year , you can bring them back to me each evening before the sun sets , I will make you payment that will satisfy your soul . '"
But here the girl looked up and answered quickly : ` Ill will come of it if he listens to your offer . '
"` Counsel unsought is worth nothing , ' replied , rudely , Ardan son of Gorla ."
` It would be little indeed that I am fit for if I can not drive three cows out to pasture and keep them safe from the wolves that may come down from the mountains .
"Therefore , good father , I will take service with you at daybreak , and ask no payment till the new year dawns . '"
"Next morning the bell of the deer was not heard amongst the fern before the maiden with the hair of gold had milked the cows , and led them in front of the cottage where the old man and Ardan son of Gorla awaited them ."
"` Let them wander where they will , ' he said to his servant , ` and never seek to turn them from their way , for well they know the fields of good pasture ."
"But take heed to follow always behind them , and suffer nothing that you see , and nought that you hear , to draw you into leaving them ."
"Now go , and may wisdom go with you . '"
"As he ceased speaking he touched one of the cows on her forehead , and she stepped along the path , with the two others one on each side ."
"As he had been bidden , behind them came Ardan son of Gorla , rejoicing in his heart that work so easy had fallen to his lot ."
"At the year 's end , thought he , enough money would lie in his pocket to carry him into far countries where his sister might be , and , in the meanwhile , someone might come past who could give him tidings of her ."
"Thus he spoke to himself , when his eyes fell on a golden cock and a silver hen running swiftly along the grass in front of him ."
In a moment the words that the old man had uttered vanished from his mind and he gave chase .
"They were so near that he could almost seize their tails , yet each time he felt sure he could catch them his fingers closed on the empty air ."
"At length he could run no more , and stopped to breathe , while the cock and hen went on as before ."
"Then he remembered the cows , and , somewhat frightened , turned back to seek them ."
"Luckily they had not strayed far , and were quietly feeding on the thick green grass ."
"Ardan son of Gorla was sitting under a tree , when he beheld a staff of gold and a staff of silver doubling themselves in strange ways on the meadow in front of him , and starting up he hastened towards them ."
"He followed them till he was tired , but he could not catch them , though they seemed ever within his reach ."
"When at last he gave up the quest his knees trembled beneath him for very weariness , and glad was he to see a tree growing close by lade with fruits of different sorts , of which he ate greedily ."
"The sun was by now low in the heavens , and the cows left off feeding , and turned their faces home again , followed by Ardan son of Gorla ."
"At the door of their stable the maiden stood awaiting them , and saying nought to their herd , she sat down and began to milk ."
"But it was not milk that flowed into her pail ; instead it was filled with a thin stream of water , and as she rose up from the last cow the old man appeared outside ."
"` Faithless one , you have betrayed your trust ! '"
he said to Ardan son of Gorla .
` Not even for one day could you keep true !
"Well , you shall have your reward at once , that others may take warning from you . '"
"And waving his wand he touched with it the chest of the youth , who became a pillar of stone ."
"Now Gorla of the Flocks and his wife were full of grief that they had lost a son as well as a daughter , for no tidings had come to them of Ardan their eldest born ."
"At length , when two years and two days had passed since the maiden had led her kids to feed on the mountain and had been seen no more , Ruais , second son of Gorla , rose up one morning , and said : ` Time is long without my sister and Ardan my brother ."
So I have vowed to seek them wherever they may be . '
And his father answered : ` Better it had been if you had first asked my consent and that of your mother ; but as you have vowed so must you do . '
"Then he bade his wife make a cake , but instead she made two , and offered Ruais his choice , as she had done to Ardan ."
"Like Ardan , Ruais chose the large , unblessed cake , and set forth on his way , doing always , though he knew it not , that which Ardan had done ; so , needless is it to tell what befell him till he too stood , a pillar of stone , on the hill behind the cottage , so that all men might see the fate that awaited those who broke their faith ."
"Another year and a day passed by , when Covan the Brown-haired , youngest son of Gorla of the Flocks , one morning spake to his parents , saying : ` It is more than three years since my sister left us ."
"My brothers have also gone , no one know whither , and of us four none remains but I. No , therefore , I long to seek them , and I pray you and my mother to place no hindrance in my way . '"
"And his father answered : ` Go , then , and take our blessing with you . '"
"So the wife of Gorla of the Flocks baked two cakes , one large and one small ; and Covan took the small one , and started on his quest ."
"In the wood he felt hungry , for he had walked far , and he sat down to eat ."
Suddenly a voice behind him cried : ' A bit for me !
a bit for me ! '
And looking round he beheld the black raven of the wilderness .
"` Yes , you shall have a bit , ' said Covan the Brown-haired ; and breaking off a piece he stretched it upwards to the raven , who ate it greedily ."
"Then Covan arose and went forward , till he saw the light from the cottage streaming before him , and glad was he , for night was at hand ."
"` Maybe I shall find some work there , ' he thought , ` and at least I shall gain money to help me in my search ; for who knows how far my sister and my brothers may have wandered ? '"
"The door stood open and he entered , and the old man gave him welcome , and the golden-haired maiden likewise ."
"As happened before , he was offered by the old man to herd his cows ; and , as she had done to his brothers , the maiden counselled him to leave such work alone ."
"But , instead of answering rudely , like both Ardan and Ruais , he thanked her , with courtesy , though he had no mind to heed her ; and he listened to the warnings and words of his new master ."
"Next day he set forth at dawn with the dun cows in front of him , and followed patiently wherever they might lead him ."
"On the way he saw the gold cock and silver hen , which ran even closer to him than they had done to his brothers ."
"Sorely tempted , he longed to give them chase ; but , remembering in time that he had been bidden to look neither to the right nor to the left , with a mighty effort he turned his eyes away ."
"Then the gold and silver staffs seemed to spring from the earth before him , but this time also he overcame ; and though the fruit from the magic tree almost touched his mouth , he brushed it aside and went steadily on ."
"What was good enough for his father was good enough for him , he used to say ."
"I hope it is not unfilial to say that I think he was wrong in that point of view , but I am not sure I go so far as to approve of aeroplanes , though they may be a military necessity ."
If the Almighty had meant us to fly he would have provided us with wings .
Since He did not it is plain He meant us to stick to the solid earth .
"At any rate , you will never see me , Mrs. Dr. dear , cavorting through the sky in an aeroplane . ''"
"`` But you wo n't refuse to cavort a bit in father 's new automobile when it comes , will you , Susan ? ''"
teased Rilla .
"`` I do not expect to trust my old bones in automobiles , either , '' retorted Susan ."
`` But I do not look upon them as some narrow-minded people do .
Whiskers-on-the-moon says the Government should be turned out of office for permitting them to run on the Island at all .
"He foams at the mouth , they tell me , when he sees one ."
"The other day he saw one coming along that narrow side-road by his wheatfield , and Whiskers bounded over the fence and stood right in the middle of the road , with his pitchfork ."
"The man in the machine was an agent of some kind , and Whiskers hates agents as much as he hates automobiles ."
"He made the car come to a halt , because there was not room to pass him on either side , and the agent could not actually run over him ."
"Then he raised his pitchfork and shouted , ` Get out of this with your devil-machine or I will run this pitchfork clean through you . '"
"And Mrs. Dr. dear , if you will believe me , that poor agent had to back his car clean out to the Lowbridge road , nearly a mile , Whiskers following him every step , shaking his pitchfork and bellowing insults ."
I 'll mind that when we come to clear accounts . ''
"And I believe he not only meant what he said , but would have done it ; so high a place did the Covenant hold in his affections ."

"`` Keep her away a point , '' sings out Mr. Riach ."
`` Reef to windward ! ''
"And just at the same time the tide caught the brig , and threw the wind out of her sails ."
"She came round into the wind like a top , and the next moment struck the reef with such a dunch as threw us all flat upon the deck , and came near to shake Mr. Riach from his place upon the mast ."
I was on my feet in a minute .
"The reef on which we had struck was close in under the southwest end of Mull , off a little isle they call Earraid , which lay low and black upon the larboard ."
"Sometimes the swell broke clean over us ; sometimes it only ground the poor brig upon the reef , so that we could hear her beat herself to pieces ; and what with the great noise of the sails , and the singing of the wind , and the flying of the spray in the moonlight , and the sense of danger , I think my head must have been partly turned , for I could scarcely understand the things I saw ."
"Presently I observed Mr. Riach and the seamen busy round the skiff , and , still in the same blank , ran over to assist them ; and as soon as I set my hand to work , my mind came clear again ."
"It was no very easy task , for the skiff lay amidships and was full of hamper , and the breaking of the heavier seas continually forced us to give over and hold on ; but we all wrought like horses while we could ."
Meanwhile such of the wounded as could move came clambering out of the fore-scuttle and began to help ; while the rest that lay helpless in their bunks harrowed me with screaming and begging to be saved .

It seemed he was struck stupid .

"Once, Queen Victoria herself gave medals to some wounded and disabled soldiers who had fought very bravely.

The Relief of Lucknow
"During the time of the terrible Indian Mutiny, when most of the native troops rose against their British rulers, and vowed to kill every white person in the land, many cruel deeds were done. A great number of white people were slain before the British troops could come to their rescue, but in some places they managed to hold out until help reached them."
"This was the case in the city of Lucknow, where the British governor with a small body of troops, and a great many women and children, took refuge in the Government House from a vast host of rebels who came to attack them. Many of the brave defenders were killed by the shot and shell of the enemy. Many others, and especially the little children, fell sick and died, for the heat was very great, and there was no good water to be had. Then, after many days, a small body of white soldiers fought their way into the city, and brought help and hope to the rest of the party. They were only just in time. Had they come a few days later they would have found the Government House a heap of ruins, and their friends dead, for the rebels were making a mine under the building and meant to blow it up with gunpowder. But alas! the newcomers were not strong enough to fight their way out of Lucknow with a crowd of helpless women and children and sick folk, so they, too were now shut in. For two months longer they held out. Then at last, when they had almost lost hope, the great Sir Colin Campbell with his brave Highlanders and other soldiers defeated the rebels, and brought the band of sick, starving, and weary people safely away."
Grace Darling
"On a small rocky island, off the north coast of England, there is a lighthouse. A man named William Darling was once keeper of this lighthouse, and his daughter Grace lived with him. Every day Grace Darling helped her father to trim the lamps, so that at night they might shine brightly, and warn sailors to steer their ships away from the dangerous rocks, upon which they would have been dashed to pieces."
"One stormy night Grace woke with the sound of screams in her ears. The screams came from the sea, so she knew that some ship must be in distress. She roused her father, but they could see nothing in the darkness. When daylight came, they found that a ship had been wrecked upon the rocks some way off, and a few people were clinging to the masts. Grace wished to go at once in a boat to save them; but at first her father hung back, for the wind and sea were wild, and he feared that the small boat would be overturned by the great waves. Then Grace ran to the boat, and seized an oar, for she could not bear to let the poor men die without trying to save them; and the father could not let his brave, daughter go alone, so he followed, and they rowed off."
"It was hard work pulling against the strong sea, and several times the small boat was almost sunk. But at last it reached the wreck, and William Darling managed to land upon the rock, and with great care and skill helped the half-frozen people into the small boat. Then they were taken to the lighthouse, where Grace warmed and fed them, until the storm ceased, and they could return to their homes."
David Livingstone
"At one time many people believed that the middle of Africa was a sandy desert, where nothing could live but camels and ostriches. But they were mistaken. The great traveller, David Livingstone, journeyed into this unknown country, and he found that it was not a desert but a beautiful land, where many tribes of black people dwelt. He also saw that these people were often seized by strangers, and taken away to be sold as slaves. This sight filled him with sadness, and he made up his mind to put a stop to this cruel traffic. He worked hard, tracing the courses of the rivers, finding the best tracts of land, and teaching the natives."
"Then he urged his countrymen to send others after him to settle in this fair country, to help the natives to learn useful trades, and to drive away the slave-merchants."
"For some years he was quite alone, with his black servants, in the midst of this wild land. His friends grew anxious, and sent Mr. Stanley, another great traveller, to look for him. Stanley marched for nearly a year before he found Livingstone. The old explorer was white and worn with sickness and hardship, and he was overjoyed to clasp once more the hand of a white man, and to hear again the English tongue. But he would not return to England. He said his work was not yet done, and he set out once more on his travels. It was his last journey. One morning his servants found him dead upon his bed. Since that time much has been done to make Central Africa a prosperous land. Other white men have followed where Livingstone led, and wherever they have settled, the wicked slave-trade has been stopped."
The Battle of Waterloo
"Fields of waving corn, green woods, fruitful orchards, a pretty farmhouse and a few cottages such was the plain of Waterloo. And there, on a summer Sunday, nearly a hundred years ago, was fought a famous battle, in which the British troops under the Duke of Wellington beat the French army, and broke the power of the great Napoleon for ever."
"""We have them,"" cried Napoleon as he saw the British drawn up before him. He thought it would be easy to destroy this army, so much smaller than his own, before their friends the Prussians, who were on the way to help them, came up. But he was mistaken. Wellington had placed his foot-soldiers in squares, and though the French horsemen, then the finest soldiers in the world, charged again and again, these little clumps of brave men stood fast. On his favourite horse ""Copenhagen"", Wellington rode to and fro cheering his men. ""Stand firm, my lads,"""
"cried he. ""What will they say to this in England?"""
"Not till evening, when the Prussians came, would he allow them to charge the French in their turn. Then, waving his cocked hat over his head, he gave the order, ""The whole line will advance"", and the impatient troops dashed forward. The French bravely tried to stand against this terrific charge, but they were beaten back, and the battle of Waterloo was ended."
"Sixty thousand men lay dead or wounded under the fruit-trees, and among the trampled corn and grass at the end of that terrible day."
The Charge of the Light Brigade
Forward the Light!
"Such was the order given during a great battle to the leader of a band of six hundred British soldiers. Forward! And there in front was a line of cannon ready to shoot them down as they came, while on the hills on either side of the valley were the guns and riflemen of the Russians."
"""Surely someone has blundered! My men are sent to certain death,"""
thought the leader of the Light Brigade.
"""Forward! Attack!"""
"The order was repeated, and with the obedience of well-trained soldiers the Brigade started."
"But at teatime another thing happened. Effie's brother Harry fished something out of his tea, which he thought at first was an earwig. He was just getting ready to drop it on the floor, and end its life in the usual way, when it shook itself in the spoon spread two wet wings, and flopped onto the tablecloth. There it sat, stroking itself with its feet and stretching its wings, and Harry said: ""Why, it's a tiny newt!"""
"The professor leaned forward before the doctor could say a word. ""I'll give you half a crown for it, Harry, my lad,"" he said, speaking very fast; and then he picked it up carefully on his handkerchief."
"""It is a new specimen,"" he said, ""and finer than yours, Doctor."""
"It was a tiny lizard, about half an inch long with scales and wings."
"So now the doctor and the professor each had a specimen, and they were both very pleased. But before long these specimens began to seem less valuable. For the next morning, when the knife-boy was cleaning the doctor's boots, he suddenly dropped the brushes and the boot and the blacking, and screamed out that he was burnt."
"And from inside the boot came crawling a lizard as big as a kitten, with large, shiny wings."
"""Why,"" said Effie, ""I know what it is. It is a dragon like the one St."
"George killed."""
"And Effie was right. That afternoon Towser was bitten in the garden by a dragon about the size of a rabbit, which he had tried to chase, and the next morning all the papers were full of the wonderful ""winged lizards"""
"that were appearing all over the country. The papers would not call them dragons, because, of course, no one believes in dragons nowadays and at any rate the papers were not going to be so silly as to believe in fairy stories. At first there were only a few, but in a week or two the country was simply running alive with dragons of all sizes, and in the air you could sometimes see them as thick as a swarm of bees. They all looked alike except as to size. They were green with scales, and they had four legs and a long tail and great wings like bats' wings, only the wings were a pale, half-transparent yellow, like the gear-boxes on bicycles."
"They breathed fire and smoke, as all proper dragons must, but still the newspapers went on pretending they were lizards, until the editor of the Standard was picked up and carried away by a very large one, and then the other newspaper people had not anyone left to tell them what they ought not to believe. So when the largest elephant in the Zoo was carried off by a dragon, the papers gave up pretending and put ALARMING PLAGUE OF DRAGONS at the top of the paper."
"You have no idea how alarming it was, and at the same time how aggravating. The large-size dragons were terrible certainly, but when once you had found out that the dragons always went to bed early because they were afraid of the chill night air, you had only to stay indoors all day, and you were pretty safe from the big ones. But the smaller sizes were a perfect nuisance. The ones as big as earwigs got in the soap, and they got in the butter. The ones as big as dogs got in the bath, and the fire and smoke inside them made them steam like anything when the cold water tap was turned on, so that careless people were often scalded quite severely. The ones that were as large as pigeons would get into workbaskets or corner drawers and bite you when you were in a hurry to get a needle or a handkerchief. The ones as big as sheep were easier to avoid, because you could see them coming; but when they flew in at the windows and curled up under your eiderdown, and you did not find them till you went to bed, it was always a shock. The ones this size did not eat people, only lettuce, but they always scorched the sheets and pillowcases dreadfully."
"Of course, the County Council and the police did everything that could be done: It was no use offering the hand of the Princess to anyone who killed a dragon. This way was all very well in olden times when there was only one dragon and one Princess; but now there were far more dragons than Princesses although the Royal Family was a large one. And besides, it would have been a mere waste of Princesses to offer rewards for killing dragons, because everybody killed as many dragons as they could quite out of their own heads and without rewards at all, just to get the nasty things out of the way. The County Council undertook to cremate all dragons delivered at their offices between the hours of ten and two, and whole wagonloads and cartloads and truckloads of dead dragons could be seen any day of the week standing in a long line in the street where the County Council had their offices. Boys brought barrowloads of dead dragons, and children on their way home from morning school would call in to leave the handful or two of little dragons they had brought in their satchels, or carried in their knotted pocket handkerchiefs. And yet there seemed to be as many dragons as ever. Then the police stuck up great wood and canvas towers covered with patent glue. When the dragons flew against these towers, they stuck fast, as flies and wasps do on the sticky papers in the kitchen; and when the towers were covered all over with dragons, the police inspector used to set fire to the towers, and burnt them and dragons and all."
"And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever. The shops were full of patent dragon poison and anti-dragon soap, and dragonproof curtains for the windows; and indeed, everything that could be done was done."
And yet there seemed to be more dragons than ever.
"It was not very easy to know what would poison a dragon, because, you see, they ate such different things. The largest kind ate elephants as long as there were any, and then went on with horses and cows. Another size ate nothing but lilies of the valley, and a third size ate only Prime Ministers if they were to be had, and, if not, would feed freely on servants in livery. Another size lived on bricks, and three of them ate two thirds of the South Lambeth Infirmary in one afternoon."
"But the size Effie was most afraid of was about as big as your dining room, and that size ate little girls and boys."
"At first Effie and her brother were quite pleased with the change in their lives. It was so amusing to sit up all night instead of going to sleep, and to play in the garden lighted by electric lamps. And it sounded so funny to hear Mother say, when they were going to bed: ""Good night, my darlings, sleep sound all day, and don't get up too soon. You must not get up before it's quite dark. You wouldn't like the nasty dragons to catch you."""
"But after a time they got very tired of it all: They wanted to see the flowers and trees growing in the fields, and to see the pretty sunshine out of doors, and not just through glass windows and patent dragonproof curtains. And they wanted to play on the grass, which they were not allowed to do in the electric lamp-lighted garden because of the night-dew."
"And they wanted so much to get out, just for once, in the beautiful, bright, dangerous daylight, that they began to try and think of some reason why they ought to go out. Only they did not like to disobey their mother."
"But one morning their mother was busy preparing some new dragon poison to lay down in the cellars, and their father was bandaging the hand of the boot boy, which had been scratched by one of the dragons who liked to eat Prime Ministers when they were to be had, so nobody remembered to say to the children: ""Don't get up till it is quite dark!"""
"""Go now,"" said Harry. ""It would not be disobedient to go. And I know exactly what we ought to do, but I don't know how we ought to do it."""
"""What ought we to do?"" said Effie."
"""We ought to wake St. George, of course,"" said Harry. ""He was the only person in his town who knew how to manage dragons; the people in the fairy tales don't count. But St. George is a real person, and he is only asleep, and he is waiting to be waked up. Only nobody believes in St."
"George now. I heard father say so."""
"""We do,"" said Effie."
"""Of course we do. And don't you see, Ef, that's the very reason why we could wake him? You can't wake people if you don't believe in them, can you?"""
"Effie said no, but where could they find St. George?"
"""We must go and look,"" said Harry boldly. ""You shall wear a dragonproof frock, made of stuff like the curtains. And I will smear myself all over with the best dragon poison, and """
"Effie clasped her hands and skipped with joy and cried: ""Oh, Harry! I know where we can find St. George! In St. George's Church, of course."""
"""Um,"" said Harry, wishing he had thought of it for himself, ""you have a little sense sometimes, for a girl."""
"""Theirs not to make reply,    Theirs not to reason why,    Theirs but to do and die:"
"Into the valley of Death    Rode the six hundred."""
"On every side thundered the enemy's guns, and shot and shell fell thick and fast, but on through all rode the brave horsemen, on till they reached the cannon at the end of the valley. The smoke of the enemy's fire closed round and hid them from their watching comrades, but now and again the scarlet lines could be seen cutting down those who tried to stop their charge."
"""Flashed all their sabres bare,    Flashed as they turned in air,    Sabring the gunners there,    Charging an army, while    All the world wonder'd."""
"And then only, when the strange order had been obeyed, when their duty had been nobly done in the face of death, did the Light Brigade all that was left of it turn to ride back. Alas! there were not then six hundred. Barely two hundred brave men, wounded, and blackened by smoke and powder, reached the British camp. The rest of the noble band lay dead or dying in the valley of Death."
"""When can their glory fade?"
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wonder'd.
Honour the charge they made!
"Honour the Light Brigade,    Noble six hundred!"""
The Coronation of King Edward VII
"Never had a country a more popular king than King Edward VII, nor a more gracious queen than Queen Alexandra, and never was a happier day for the English people than that on which King Edward was crowned. A few days before the date fixed for the Coronation the king suddenly became ill, and a great gloom fell over the country, for it was feared that he might never be crowned. But though his illness was severe he soon began to get better, and when he was out of danger the hearts of his subjects were filled with joy and thankfulness. Guns were fired, church-bells pealed, and glad shouts and cheers rang out from the happy crowds which lined the streets of London, through which the king and queen, in the midst of their gay procession, drove to Westminster Abbey."
"Inside the gray old Abbey was one of the most brilliant gatherings the world has ever seen. Princes and princesses from other lands were there, in their robes of state; peers and peeresses, in velvet, and ermine, and glittering diamonds; grave statesmen; and soldiers in their gay uniforms."
"It was a grand and solemn scene when, before them all, the aged Archbishop of Canterbury drew near to the King, and with trembling hands placed the crown upon his head."
"""The Lord give you a fruitful country, and healthful seasons, victorious fleets and armies, and a quiet Empire."" These are the words that the old man said when he had crowned the king, and each one of us will pray that all these blessings may indeed rest upon King Edward VII, and the great Empire over which he rules."
WAR.
"Over the broad, fair valley,     Filling the heart with fear,   Comes the sound of tramping horses,     And the news of danger near."
"'Tis the enemy approaching,     One can hear the muffled drum,   And the marching of the soldiers,     As on and on they come."
"Soon the air is rent in sunder,     Bullets flying sharp and fast,   Many stout hearts fail and tremble,     Every moment seems their last."
"On the ground lie dead and dying,     Young and old alike must fall;   None to come and aid the sufferer,     Fight they must for freedom's call."
"Many are the anxious loved ones     Praying for the war to cease,   Waiting for the right to conquer,     Bringing freedom, rest, and peace."
E.S.
A BOY'S HEROIC DEEDS.
"May 31st, 1889, is a day that will long be remembered with horror by the people in the beautiful valley of the Conemaugh, in Pennsylvania. On that date occurred the terrible disaster which is known to the world and will be named in history as the ""Johnstown Flood."""
"For many days previous to that date it had been raining hard, and great floods extended over a vast region of country in Pennsylvania, New York and the District of Columbia. Never before had there been such a fall of rain in that region within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. The waters in the river and creeks of that beautiful valley rose rapidly and overflowed their banks, while the people looked on in wonder, but seemingly not in fear. Suddenly there appeared to their wondering gaze a great bay horse galloping at break-neck speed and bearing a rider who waved his hands to them and cried: ""South Fork dam will burst. To the hills for your lives."" Only a few heeded his words of warning, while many mocked and jeered. On dashed the rider to warn still others of the impending danger, and, alas, to be himself and horse dashed to death by the massive timbers of a falling bridge. South Fork dam did break, and the mighty waters of Conemaugh Lake were hurled with resistless force upon the doomed people of that beautiful valley. The terrible details of the appalling disaster would fill several volumes larger than this. On rushed the mighty waters, sweeping onward in their flood dwellings, churches and buildings of every description, whether of wood, brick or stone, until Johnstown was reached and destroyed. The town was literally lifted from its foundations. Thousands of men, women and children were caught up and swirled away in the pitiless flood, and their agonizing but vain appeals for help could be heard amidst the mighty roar of the waters. Many acts of heroism were performed by brave men and women yes, and boys in rescuing victims of the flood. Only one of them concerns us here. Charles Hepenthal, a schoolboy, seventeen years of age, who was on his way to Bellefonte from his home at East Liberty, Pa., on the evening of the flood, stood quietly among the passengers on the express train, as they crowded to view the terrible havoc done by the flood. As the flood reached the train, at Sang Hollow, a small frame house came pitching down the mad tide, an eddy floated it in, near to the train, so close that the wailing cries of an infant were heard, piercing their way through the roar. Charles Hepenthal's heart was touched and his courage was equal to the emergency. He determined to rescue that little wailing waif from a watery grave. Strong men urged him to desist, insisting that he would only sacrifice his own life for nothing that it was impossible for any one to survive in the surging waters. But the boy was resolved."
"He cut the bell cord from the cars, tied it fast to his body, and out into the whirling gulf he went; he gained the house, secured the infant and returned through the maddened waters with the rescued babe in his arms. A shout went up from the passengers on the train. ""Wait!"" he cried; ""there is still another in the house, I must save her!"" and, seizing a plank to use as a support, he plunged again into the surging waters. Ah! his struggle this time was harder, for his precious load was heavy. In the floating house on his first visit he found a little girl, apparently ten years old, disrobed and kneeling beside her bed, on which lay the screaming infant, praying to her Father in heaven to save her and her baby brother from the fury of the flood. ""God has heard my prayer,"" she cried, as Charles entered the door. ""Oh, save the baby, quick,"" and then fainted away on the floor. When Charles had landed the babe in safety and returned again for the girl, he found her still unconscious on the floor, and the water was fast flowing in at the door."
"In another minute she would have been drowned. But the brave boy's manly arms were soon around her, and with his precious load the young hero fought his way back to land and was given three times three cheers and a ""tiger"" by the passengers of the day express."
A CAT'S EXTRAORDINARY LEAP.
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let out the star;"" and with these words she carried off the babe."
"But when those who were on the watch woke, they thought the queen had eaten her own child, and the old queen was all for burning her alive, but the Prince was so fond of her that at last he begged her off, but he had hard work to set her free."
"So the next time the young queen was to have a child, twice as strong a watch was set as the first time, but the same thing happened over again, only this time her Foster-mother said:"
"""Now you shall be as grieved as I was when you let the moon out."""
"And the queen begged and prayed, and wept; for when her Foster-mother was there, she could speak but it was all no good."
"And now the old queen said she must be burnt, but the Prince found means to beg her off. But when the third child was to be born, a watch was set three times as strong as the first, but just the same thing happened. Her Foster-mother came while the watch slept, took the babe, and cut its little finger, and smeared the queen's mouth with the blood, telling her now she should be as grieved as she had been when the Lassie let out the sun."
"And now the Prince could not save her any longer. She must and should be burnt. But just as they were leading her to the stake, all at once they saw her Foster-mother, who came with all three children two she led by the hand, and the third she had on her arm; and so she went up to the young queen and said:"
"""Here are your children; now you shall have them again. I am the Virgin Mary, and so grieved as you have been, so grieved was I when you let out sun, and moon, and star. Now you have been punished for what you did, and henceforth you shall have your speech."""
"How glad the Queen and Prince now were, all may easily think, but no one can tell. After that they were always happy; and from that day even the Prince's mother was very fond of the young queen."
THE HUSBAND WHO WAS TO MIND THE HOUSE
"Once on a time there was a man, so surly and cross, he never thought his Wife did anything right in the house. So, one evening, in haymaking time, he came home, scolding and swearing, and showing his teeth and making a dust."
"""Dear love, don't be so angry; there's a good man,"" said his goody; ""to-morrow let's change our work. I'll go out with the mowers and mow, and you shall mind the house at home."""
"Yes! the Husband thought that would do very well. He was quite willing, he said."
"So, early next morning, his goody took a scythe over her neck, and went out into the hayfield with the mowers, and began to mow; but the man was to mind the house, and do the work at home."
"First of all, he wanted to churn the butter; but when he had churned a while, he got thirsty, and went down to the cellar to tap a barrel of ale. So, just when he had knocked in the bung, and was putting the tap into the cask, he heard overhead the pig come into the kitchen. Then off he ran up the cellar steps, with the tap in his hand, as fast as he could, to look after the pig, lest it should upset the churn; but when he got up, and saw the pig had already knocked the churn over, and stood there, routing and grunting amongst the cream which was running all over the floor, he got so wild with rage that he quite forgot the ale-barrel, and ran at the pig as hard as he could. He caught it, too, just as it ran out of doors, and gave it such a kick, that piggy lay for dead on the spot. Then all at once he remembered he had the tap in his hand; but when he got down to the cellar, every drop of ale had run out of the cask."
"Then he went into the dairy and found enough cream left to fill the churn again, and so he began to churn, for butter they must have at dinner. When he had churned a bit, he remembered that their milking cow was still shut up in the byre, and hadn't had a bit to eat or a drop to drink all the morning, though the sun was high. Then all at once he thought 'twas too far to take her down to the meadow, so he'd just get her up on the house top for the house, you must know, was thatched with sods, and a fine crop of grass was growing there. Now the house lay close up against a steep down, and he thought if he laid a plank across to the thatch at the back he'd easily get the cow up."
"But still he couldn't leave the churn, for there was his little babe crawling about on the floor, and ""if I leave it,"" he thought, ""the child is safe to upset it."" So he took the churn on his back, and went out with it; but then he thought he'd better first water the cow before he turned her out on the thatch; so he took up a bucket to draw water out of the well; but, as he stooped down at the well's brink, all the cream ran out of the churn over his shoulders, and so down into the well."
"Now it was near dinner-time, and he hadn't even got the butter yet; so he thought he'd best boil the porridge, and filled the pot with water and hung it over the fire. When he had done that, he thought the cow might perhaps fall off the thatch and break her legs or her neck. So he got up on the house to tie her up. One end of the rope he made fast to the cow's neck and the other he slipped down the chimney and tied round his own thigh; and he had to make haste, for the water now began to boil in the pot, and he had still to grind the oatmeal."
"So he began to grind away; but while he was hard at it, down fell the cow off the house-top after all, and as she fell, she dragged the man up the chimney by the rope. There he stuck fast; and as for the cow, she hung half-way down the wall, swinging between heaven and earth, for she could neither get down nor up."
"And now the goody had waited seven lengths and seven breadths for her Husband to come and call them home to dinner; but never a call they had. At last she thought she'd waited long enough, and went home. But when she got there and saw the cow hanging in such an ugly place, she ran up and cut the rope in two with her scythe. But, as she did this, down came her Husband out of the chimney; and so, when his old dame came inside the kitchen, there she found him standing on his head in the porridge pot."
THE LAD WHO WENT TO THE NORTH WIND
"Once on a time there was an old widow who had one son; and as she was poorly and weak, her son had to go up into the safe to fetch meal for cooking; but when he got outside the safe, and was just going down the steps, there came the North Wind puffing and blowing, caught up the meal, and so away with it through the air. Then the Lad went back into the safe for more; but when he came out again on the steps, if the North Wind didn't come again and carry off the meal with a puff:"
"and, more than that, he did so the third time. At this the Lad got very angry; and as he thought it hard that the North Wind should behave so, he thought he'd just look him up, and ask him to give up his meal."
"So off he went, but the way was long, and he walked and walked; but at last he came to the North Wind's house."
"""Good day!"" said the Lad, ""and thank you for coming to see us yesterday."""
"""GOOD DAY!"" answered the North Wind, for his voice was loud and gruff, ""AND THANKS FOR COMING TO SEE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT?"""
"""Oh!"" answered the Lad, ""I only wished to ask you to be so good as to let me have back that meal you took from me on the safe steps, for we haven't much to live on; and if you're to go on snapping up the morsel we have, there'll be nothing for it but to starve."""
"""I haven't got your meal,"" said the North Wind; ""but if you are in such need, I'll give you a cloth which will get you everything you want, if you only say, 'Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes!'"""
"With this the Lad was well content. But, as the way was so long he couldn't get home in one day, so he turned into an inn on the way; and when they were going to sit down to supper he laid the cloth on a table which stood in the corner, and said:"
"""Cloth, spread yourself, and serve up all kinds of good dishes."""
"He had scarce said so before the cloth did as it was bid; and all who stood by thought it a fine thing, but most of all the landlady. So, when all were fast asleep at dead of night, she took the Lad's cloth, and put another in its stead, just like the one he had got from the North Wind, but which couldn't so much as serve up a bit of dry bread."
"The Queen, however, did not love the King because he had no nose, but she would have much liked to love Ferdinand the Faithful. Once, therefore, when all the lords of the court were together, the Queen said she could do feats of magic, that she could cut off any one’s head and put it on again, and that one of them ought just to try it. But none of them would be the first, so Ferdinand the Faithful, again at the instigation of Ferdinand the Unfaithful, undertook it and she hewed off his head, and put it on again for him, and it healed together directly, so that it looked as if he had a red thread round his throat."
"Then the King said to her, “My child, and where hast thou learnt that?”"
"“Yes,” she said, “I understand the art; shall I just try it on thee also?” “Oh, yes,” said he. But she cut off his head, and did not put it on again; but pretended that she could not get it on, and that it would not keep fixed. Then the King was buried, but she married Ferdinand the Faithful."
"He, however, always rode on his white horse, and once when he was seated on it, it told him that he was to go on to the heath which he knew, and gallop three times round it. And when he had done that, the white horse stood up on its hind legs, and was changed into a King’s son."
127 The Iron Stove
"In the days when wishing was still of some use, a King’s son was bewitched by an old witch, and shut up in an iron stove in a forest."
"There he passed many years, and no one could deliver him. Then a King’s daughter came into the forest, who had lost herself, and could not find her father’s kingdom again. After she had wandered about for nine days, she at length came to the iron stove. Then a voice came forth from it, and asked her, “Whence comest thou, and whither goest, thou?” She answered, “I have lost my father’s kingdom, and cannot get home again.”"
"Then a voice inside the iron stove said, “I will help thee to get home again, and that indeed most swiftly, if thou wilt promise to do what I desire of thee. I am the son of a far greater King than thy father, and I will marry thee.”"
"Then was she afraid, and thought, “Good heavens! What can I do with an iron stove?” But as she much wished to get home to her father, she promised to do as he desired. But he said, “Thou shalt return here, and bring a knife with thee, and scrape a hole in the iron.” Then he gave her a companion who walked near her, but did not speak, but in two hours he took her home; there was great joy in the castle when the King’s daughter came home, and the old King fell on her neck and kissed her. She, however, was sorely troubled, and said, “Dear father, what I have suffered! I should never have got home again from the great wild forest, if I had not come to an iron stove, but I have been forced to give my word that I will go back to it, set it free, and marry it.”"
"Then the old King was so terrified that he all but fainted, for he had but this one daughter. They therefore resolved they would send, in her place, the miller’s daughter, who was very beautiful. They took her there, gave her a knife, and said she was to scrape at the iron stove."
"So she scraped at it for four-and-twenty hours, but could not bring off the least morsel of it. When day dawned, a voice in the stove said, “It seems to me it is day outside.” Then she answered, “It seems so to me too; I fancy I hear the noise of my father’s mill.”"
"“So thou art a miller’s daughter! Then go thy way at once, and let the King’s daughter come here.” Then she went away at once, and told the old King that the man outside there, would have none of her he wanted the King’s daughter. They, however, still had a swine-herd’s daughter, who was even prettier than the miller’s daughter, and they determined to give her a piece of gold to go to the iron stove instead of the King’s daughter. So she was taken thither, and she also had to scrape for four-and-twenty hours. She, however, made nothing of it. When day broke, a voice inside the stove cried, “It seems to me it is day outside!” Then answered she, “So it seems to me also; I fancy I hear my father’s horn blowing.”"
"“Then thou art a swine-herd’s daughter! Go away at once, and tell the King’s daughter to come, and tell her all must be done as promised, and if she does not come, everything in the kingdom shall be ruined and destroyed, and not one stone be left standing on another.” When the King’s daughter heard that she began to weep, but now there was nothing for it but to keep her promise. So she took leave of her father, put a knife in her pocket, and went forth to the iron stove in the forest."
"When she got there, she began to scrape, and the iron gave way, and when two hours were over, she had already scraped a small hole. Then she peeped in, and saw a youth so handsome, and so brilliant with gold and with precious jewels, that her very soul was delighted. Now, therefore, she went on scraping, and made the hole so large that he was able to get out. Then said he, “Thou art mine, and I am thine; thou art my bride, and hast released me.” He wanted to take her away with him to his kingdom, but she entreated him to let her go once again to her father, and the King’s son allowed her to do so, but she was not to say more to her father than three words, and then she was to come back again. So she went home, but she spoke more than three words, and instantly the iron stove disappeared, and was taken far away over glass mountains and piercing swords; but the King’s son was set free, and no longer shut up in it. After this she bade good-bye to her father, took some money with her, but not much, and went back to the great forest, and looked for the iron stove, but it was nowhere to be found. For nine days she sought it, and then her hunger grew so great that she did not know what to do, for she could no longer live. When it was evening, she seated herself in a small tree, and made up her mind to spend the night there, as she was afraid of wild beasts. When midnight drew near she saw in the distance a small light, and thought, “Ah, there I should be saved!” She got down from the tree, and went towards the light, but on the way she prayed. Then she came to a little old house, and much grass had grown all about it, and a small heap of wood lay in front of it."
"She thought, “Ah, whither have I come,” and peeped in through the window, but she saw nothing inside but toads, big and little, except a table well covered with wine and roast meat, and the plates and glasses were of silver. Then she took courage, and knocked at the door. The fat toad cried,"
"“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither, And quickly see who is without:”"
"and a small toad came walking by and opened the door to her. When she entered, they all bade her welcome, and she was forced to sit down."
"They asked, “Where hast thou come from, and whither art thou going?”"
"Then she related all that had befallen her, and how because she had transgressed the order which had been given her not to say more than three words, the stove, and the King’s son also, had disappeared, and now she was about to seek him over hill and dale until she found him."
"Then the old fat one said,"
"“Little green waiting-maid, Waiting-maid with the limping leg, Little dog of the limping leg, Hop hither and thither, And bring me the great box.”"
"Then the little one went and brought the box. After this they gave her meat and drink, and took her to a well-made bed, which felt like silk and velvet, and she laid herself therein, in God’s name, and slept."
"When morning came she arose, and the old toad gave her three needles out of the great box which she was to take with her; they would be needed by her, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, and go over three piercing swords and a great lake. If she did all this she would get her lover back again. Then she gave her three things, which she was to take the greatest care of, namely, three large needles, a plough-wheel, and three nuts. With these she travelled onwards, and when she came to the glass mountain which was so slippery, she stuck the three needles first behind her feet and then before them, and so got over it, and when she was over it, she hid them in a place which she marked carefully. After this she came to the three piercing swords, and then she seated herself on her plough-wheel, and rolled over them."
"At last she arrived in front of a great lake, and when she had crossed it, she came to a large and beautiful castle. She went and asked for a place; she was a poor girl, she said, and would like to be hired. She knew, however, that the King’s son whom she had released from the iron stove in the great forest was in the castle. Then she was taken as a scullery-maid at low wages. But, already the King’s son had another maiden by his side whom he wanted to marry, for he thought that she had long been dead."
"In the evening, when she had washed up and was done, she felt in her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given her. She cracked one with her teeth, and was going to eat the kernel when lo and behold there was a stately royal garment in it! But when the bride heard of this she came and asked for the dress, and wanted to buy it, and said, “It is not a dress for a servant-girl.” But she said no, she would not sell it, but if the bride would grant her one thing she should have it, and that was, leave to sleep one night in her bridegroom’s chamber. The bride gave her permission because the dress was so pretty, and she had never had one like it. When it was evening she said to her bridegroom, “That silly girl will sleep in thy room.”"
"“If thou art willing so am I,” said he. She, however, gave him a glass of wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. So the bridegroom and the scullery-maid went to sleep in the room, and he slept so soundly that she could not waken him."
"She wept the whole night and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and three sharp swords, and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!”"
"The servants sat by the chamber-door, and heard how she thus wept the whole night through, and in the morning they told it to their lord. And the next evening when she had washed up, she opened the second nut, and a far more beautiful dress was within it, and when the bride beheld it, she wished to buy that also. But the girl would not take money, and begged that she might once again sleep in the bridegroom’s chamber. The bride, however, gave him a sleeping-drink, and he slept so soundly that he could hear nothing. But the scullery-maid wept the whole night long, and cried, “I set thee free when thou wert in an iron stove in the wild forest, I sought thee, and walked over a glass mountain, and over three sharp swords and a great lake before I found thee, and yet thou wilt not hear me!” The servants sat by the chamber-door and heard her weeping the whole night through, and in the morning informed their lord of it. And on the third evening, when she had washed up, she opened the third nut, and within it was a still more beautiful dress which was stiff with pure gold. When the bride saw that she wanted to have it, but the maiden only gave it up on condition that she might for the third time sleep in the bridegroom’s apartment. The King’s son was, however, on his guard, and threw the sleeping-draught away. Now, therefore, when she began to weep and to cry, “Dearest love, I set thee free when thou wert in the iron stove in the terrible wild forest,” the King’s son leapt up and said, “Thou art the true one, thou art mine, and I am thine.” Thereupon, while it was still night, he got into a carriage with her, and they took away the false bride’s clothes so that she could not get up. When they came to the great lake, they sailed across it, and when they reached the three sharp-cutting swords they seated themselves on the plough-wheel, and when they got to the glass mountain they thrust the three needles in it, and so at length they got to the little old house; but when they went inside that, it was a great castle, and the toads were all disenchanted, and were King’s children, and full of happiness. Then the wedding was celebrated, and the King’s son and the princess remained in the castle, which was much larger than the castles of their fathers. As, however, the old King grieved at being left alone, they fetched him away, and brought him to live with them, and they had two kingdoms, and lived in happy wedlock."
"A mouse did run, This story is done."
128 The Lazy Spinner
"In a certain village there once lived a man and his wife, and the wife was so idle that she would never work at anything; whatever her husband gave her to spin, she did not get done, and what she did spin she did not wind, but let it all remain entangled in a heap. If the man scolded her, she was always ready with her tongue, and said, “Well, how should I wind it, when I have no reel? Just you go into the forest and get me one.” “If that is all,” said the man, “then I will go into the forest, and get some wood for making reels.” Then the woman was afraid that if he had the wood he would make her a reel of it, and she would have to wind her yarn off, and then begin to spin again. She bethought herself a little, and then a lucky idea occurred to her, and she secretly followed the man into the forest, and when he had climbed into a tree to choose and cut the wood, she crept into the thicket below where he could not see her, and cried,"
"“He who cuts wood for reels shall die, And he who winds, shall perish.”"
"“No,” replied the man, “but I must not remove the bandage, for whatsoever I look at with my eyes, splits to pieces, my glance is so powerful. If you can use that, I shall be glad to serve you.” “Come with me,” replied the King’s son, “I can make use of thee.” They journeyed onwards and found a man who was lying in the hot sunshine, trembling and shivering all over his body, so that not a limb was still. “How canst thou shiver when the sun is shining so warm?” said the King’s son. “Alack,” replied the man, “I am of quite a different nature. The hotter it is, the colder I am, and the frost pierces through all my bones; and the colder it is, the hotter I am. In the midst of ice, I cannot endure the heat, nor in the midst of fire, the cold.” “Thou art a strange fellow,” said the prince, “but if thou wilt enter my service, follow me.” They travelled onwards, and saw a man standing who made a long neck and looked about him, and could see over all the mountains. “What art thou looking at so eagerly?” said the King’s son. The man replied, “I have such sharp eyes that I can see into every forest and field, and hill and valley, all over the world.”"
"The prince said, “Come with me if thou wilt, for I am still in want of such an one.”"
"And now the King’s son and his six servants came to the town where the aged Queen dwelt. He did not tell her who he was, but said, “If you will give me your beautiful daughter, I will perform any task you set me.” The sorceress was delighted to get such a handsome youth as this into her net, and said, “I will set thee three tasks, and if thou art able to perform them all, thou shalt be husband and master of my daughter.” “What is the first to be?” “Thou shalt fetch me my ring which I have dropped into the Red Sea.” So the King’s son went home to his servants and said, “The first task is not easy. A ring is to be got out of the Red Sea. Come, find some way of doing it.” Then the man with the sharp sight said, “I will see where it is lying,” and looked down into the water and said, “It is sticking there, on a pointed stone.”"
"The Tall One carried them thither, and said, “I would soon get it out, if I could only see it.” “Oh, is that all!” cried the Stout One, and lay down and put his mouth to the water, on which all the waves fell into it just as if it had been a whirlpool, and he drank up the whole sea till it was as dry as a meadow. The Tall One stooped down a little, and brought out the ring with his hand. Then the King’s son rejoiced when he had the ring, and took it to the old Queen. She was astonished, and said, “Yes, it is the right ring. Thou hast safely performed the first task, but now comes the second. Dost thou see the meadow in front of my palace? Three hundred fat oxen are feeding there, and these must thou eat, skin, hair, bones, horns and all, and down below in my cellar lie three hundred casks of wine, and these thou must drink up as well, and if one hair of the oxen, or one little drop of the wine is left, thy life will be forfeited to me.” “May I invite no guests to this repast?” inquired the prince, “no dinner is good without some company.”"
"The old woman laughed maliciously, and replied, “Thou mayst invite one for the sake of companionship, but no more.”"
"The King’s son went to his servants and said to the Stout One, “Thou shalt be my guest to-day, and shalt eat thy fill.” Hereupon the Stout One stretched himself out and ate the three hundred oxen without leaving one single hair, and then he asked if he was to have nothing but his breakfast. He drank the wine straight from the casks without feeling any need of a glass, and he licked the last drop from his finger-nails. When the meal was over, the prince went to the old woman, and told her that the second task also was performed. She wondered at this and said, “No one has ever done so much before, but one task still remains,” and she thought to herself, “Thou shalt not escape me, and wilt not keep thy head on thy shoulders! This night,” said she, “I will bring my daughter to thee in thy chamber, and thou shalt put thine arms round her, but when you are sitting there together, beware of falling asleep. When twelve o’clock is striking, I will come, and if she is then no longer in thine arms, thou art lost.” The prince thought, “The task is easy, I will most certainly keep my eyes open.” Nevertheless he called his servants, told them what the old woman had said, and remarked, “Who knows what treachery lurks behind this? Foresight is a good thing keep watch, and take care that the maiden does not go out of my room again.” When night fell, the old woman came with her daughter, and gave her into the princes’s arms, and then the Tall One wound himself round the two in a circle, and the Stout One placed himself by the door, so that no living creature could enter. There the two sat, and the maiden spake never a word, but the moon shone through the window on her face, and the prince could behold her wondrous beauty. He did nothing but gaze at her, and was filled with love and happiness, and his eyes never felt weary. This lasted until eleven o’clock, when the old woman cast such a spell over all of them that they fell asleep, and at the self-same moment the maiden was carried away."
"Then they all slept soundly until a quarter to twelve, when the magic lost its power, and all awoke again. “Oh, misery and misfortune!” cried the prince, “now I am lost!” The faithful servants also began to lament, but the Listener said, “Be quiet, I want to listen.” Then he listened for an instant and said, “She is on a rock, three hundred leagues from hence, bewailing her fate. Thou alone, Tall One, canst help her; if thou wilt stand up, thou wilt be there in a couple of steps.”"
"“Yes,” answered the Tall One, “but the one with the sharp eyes must go with me, that we may destroy the rock.” Then the Tall One took the one with bandaged eyes on his back, and in the twinkling of an eye they were on the enchanted rock. The Tall One immediately took the bandage from the other’s eyes, and he did but look round, and the rock shivered into a thousand pieces. Then the Tall One took the maiden in his arms, carried her back in a second, then fetched his companion with the same rapidity, and before it struck twelve they were all sitting as they had sat before, quite merrily and happily. When twelve struck, the aged sorceress came stealing in with a malicious face, which seemed to say, “Now he is mine!” for she believed that her daughter was on the rock three hundred leagues off. But when she saw her in the prince’s arms, she was alarmed, and said, “Here is one who knows more than I do!” She dared not make any opposition, and was forced to give him her daughter."
"But she whispered in her ear, “It is a disgrace to thee to have to obey common people, and that thou art not allowed to choose a husband to thine own liking.”"
"On this the proud heart of the maiden was filled with anger, and she meditated revenge. Next morning she caused three hundred great bundles of wood to be got together, and said to the prince that though the three tasks were performed, she would still not be his wife until some one was ready to seat himself in the midst of the wood, and bear the fire. She thought that none of his servants would let themselves be burnt for him, and that out of love for her, he himself would place himself upon it, and then she would be free. But the servants said, “Every one of us has done something except the Frosty One, he must set to work,” and they put him in the middle of the pile, and set fire to it. Then the fire began to burn, and burnt for three days until all the wood was consumed, and when the flames had burnt out, the Frosty One was standing amid the ashes, trembling like an aspen leaf, and saying, “I never felt such a frost during the whole course of my life; if it had lasted much longer, I should have been benumbed!”"
"As no other pretext was to be found, the beautiful maiden was now forced to take the unknown youth as a husband. But when they drove away to church, the old woman said, “I cannot endure the disgrace,” and sent her warriors after them with orders to cut down all who opposed them, and bring back her daughter. But the Listener had sharpened his ears, and heard the secret discourse of the old woman. “What shall we do?”"
"said he to the Stout One. But he knew what to do, and spat out once or twice behind the carriage some of the sea-water which he had drunk, and a great sea arose in which the warriors were caught and drowned. When the sorceress perceived that, she sent her mailed knights; but the Listener heard the rattling of their armour, and undid the bandage from one eye of Sharp-eyes, who looked for a while rather fixedly at the enemy’s troops, on which they all sprang to pieces like glass. Then the youth and the maiden went on their way undisturbed, and when the two had been blessed in church, the six servants took leave, and said to their master, “Your wishes are now satisfied, you need us no longer, we will go our way and seek our fortunes.”"
"Half a league from the palace of the prince’s father was a village near which a swineherd tended his herd, and when they came thither the prince said to his wife, “Do you know who I really am? I am no prince, but a herder of swine, and the man who is there with that herd, is my father. We two shall have to set to work also, and help him.” Then he alighted with her at the inn, and secretly told the innkeepers to take away her royal apparel during the night. So when she awoke in the morning, she had nothing to put on, and the innkeeper’s wife gave her an old gown and a pair of worsted stockings, and at the same time seemed to consider it a great present, and said, “If it were not for the sake of your husband I should have given you nothing at all!” Then the princess believed that he really was a swineherd, and tended the herd with him, and thought to herself, “I have deserved this for my haughtiness and pride.” This lasted for a week, and then she could endure it no longer, for she had sores on her feet. And now came a couple of people who asked if she knew who her husband was. “Yes,” she answered, “he is a swineherd, and has just gone out with cords and ropes to try to drive a little bargain.” But they said, “Just come with us, and we will take you to him,” and they took her up to the palace, and when she entered the hall, there stood her husband in kingly raiment. But she did not recognize him until he took her in his arms, kissed her, and said, “I suffered much for thee and now thou, too, hast had to suffer for me.” And then the wedding was celebrated, and he who has told you all this, wishes that he, too, had been present at it."
135 The White Bride and the Black One
"A woman was going about the unenclosed land with her daughter and her step-daughter cutting fodder, when the Lord came walking towards them in the form of a poor man, and asked, “Which is the way into the village?” “If you want to know,” said the mother, “seek it for yourself,” and the daughter added, “If you are afraid you will not find it, take a guide with you.” But the step-daughter said, “Poor man, I will take you there, come with me.” Then God was angry with the mother and daughter, and turned his back on them, and wished that they should become as black as night and as ugly as sin. To the poor step-daughter, however, God was gracious, and went with her, and when they were near the village, he said a blessing over her, and spake, “Choose three things for thyself, and I will grant them to thee.” Then said the maiden, “I should like to be as beautiful and fair as the sun,” and instantly she was white and fair as day. “Then I should like to have a purse of money which would never grow empty.” That the Lord gave her also, but he said, “Do not forget what is best of all.” Said she, “For my third wish, I desire, after my death, to inhabit the eternal kingdom of Heaven.” That also was granted unto her, and then the Lord left her."
"When the step-mother came home with her daughter, and they saw that they were both as black as coal and ugly, but that the step-daughter was white and beautiful, wickedness increased still more in their hearts, and they thought of nothing else but how they could do her an injury. The step-daughter, however, had a brother called Reginer, whom she loved much, and she told him all that had happened. Once on a time Reginer said to her, “Dear sister, I will take thy likeness, that I may continually see thee before mine eyes, for my love for thee is so great that I should like always to look at thee.” Then she answered, “But, I pray thee, let no one see the picture.” So he painted his sister and hung up the picture in his room; he, however, dwelt in the King’s palace, for he was his coachman. Every day he went and stood before the picture, and thanked God for the happiness of having such a dear sister. Now it happened that the King whom he served, had just lost his wife, who had been so beautiful that no one could be found to compare with her, and on this account the King was in deep grief. The attendants about the court, however, remarked that the coachman stood daily before this beautiful picture, and they were jealous of him, so they informed the King. Then the latter ordered the picture to be brought to him, and when he saw that it was like his lost wife in every respect, except that it was still more beautiful, he fell mortally in love with it. He caused the coachman to be brought before him, and asked whom the portrait represented? The coachman said it was his sister, so the King resolved to take no one but her as his wife, and gave him a carriage and horses and splendid garments of cloth of gold, and sent him forth to fetch his chosen bride. When Reginer came on this errand, his sister was glad, but the black maiden was jealous of her good fortune, and grew angry above all measure, and said to her mother, “Of what use are all your arts to us now when you cannot procure such a piece of luck for me?” “Be quiet,” said the old woman, “I will soon divert it to you,” and by her arts of witchcraft, she so troubled the eyes of the coachman that he was half-blind, and she stopped the ears of the white maiden so that she was half-deaf. Then they got into the carriage, first the bride in her noble royal apparel, then the step-mother with her daughter, and Reginer sat on the box to drive."
"When they had been on the way for some time the coachman cried,"
"“Cover thee well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet thee, That the wind may not load thee with dust, That thou may’st be fair and beautiful When thou appearest before the King.”"
"The bride asked, “What is my dear brother saying?” “Ah,” said the old woman, “he says that you ought to take off your golden dress and give it to your sister.” Then she took it off, and put it on the black maiden, who gave her in exchange for it a shabby grey gown. They drove onwards, and a short time afterwards, the brother again cried,"
"“Cover thee well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet thee, That the wind may not load thee with dust, That thou may’st be fair and beautiful When thou appearest before the King.”"
"The bride asked, “What is my dear brother saying?” “Ah,” said the old woman, “he says that you ought to take off your golden hood and give it to your sister.” So she took off the hood and put it on her sister, and sat with her own head uncovered. And they drove on farther. After a while, the brother once more cried,"
"“Cover thee well, my sister dear, That the rain may not wet thee, That the wind may not load thee with dust, That thou may’st be fair and beautiful When thou appearest before the King.”"
"The bride asked, “What is my dear brother saying?” “Ah,” said the old woman, “he says you must look out of the carriage.” They were, however, just on a bridge, which crossed deep water. When the bride stood up and leant forward out of the carriage, they both pushed her out, and she fell into the middle of the water. At the same moment that she sank, a snow-white duck arose out of the mirror-smooth water, and swam down the river. The brother had observed nothing of it, and drove the carriage on until they reached the court. Then he took the black maiden to the King as his sister, and thought she really was so, because his eyes were dim, and he saw the golden garments glittering. When the King saw the boundless ugliness of his intended bride, he was very angry, and ordered the coachman to be thrown into a pit which was full of adders and nests of snakes. The old witch, however, knew so well how to flatter the King and deceive his eyes by her arts, that he kept her and her daughter until she appeared quite endurable to him, and he really married her."
"One evening when the black bride was sitting on the King’s knee, a white duck came swimming up the gutter to the kitchen, and said to the kitchen-boy, “Boy, light a fire, that I may warm my feathers.” The kitchen-boy did it, and lighted a fire on the hearth. Then came the duck and sat down by it, and shook herself and smoothed her feathers to rights with her bill. While she was thus sitting and enjoying herself, she asked, “What is my brother Reginer doing?” The scullery-boy replied, “He is imprisoned in the pit with adders and with snakes.”"
"Then she asked, “What is the black witch doing in the house?” The boy answered, “She is loved by the King and happy.”"
"“May God have mercy on him,” said the duck, and swam forth by the sink."
"The next night she came again and put the same questions, and the third night also. Then the kitchen-boy could bear it no longer, and went to the King and discovered all to him. The King, however, wanted to see it for himself, and next evening went thither, and when the duck thrust her head in through the sink, he took his sword and cut through her neck, and suddenly she changed into a most beautiful maiden, exactly like the picture, which her brother had made of her. The King was full of joy, and as she stood there quite wet, he caused splendid apparel to be brought and had her clothed in it. Then she told how she had been betrayed by cunning and falsehood, and at last thrown down into the water, and her first request was that her brother should be brought forth from the pit of snakes, and when the King had fulfilled this request, he went into the chamber where the old witch was, and asked, What does she deserve who does this and that? and related what had happened. Then was she so blinded that she was aware of nothing and said, “She deserves to be stripped naked, and put into a barrel with nails, and that a horse should be harnessed to the barrel, and the horse sent all over the world.” All of which was done to her, and to her black daughter. But the King married the white and beautiful bride, and rewarded her faithful brother, and made him a rich and distinguished man."
136 Iron John
"There was once on a time a King who had a great forest near his palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. “Perhaps some accident has befallen him,” said the King, and the next day he sent out two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away. Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said, “Scour the whole forest through, and do not give up until ye have found all three.” But of these also, none came home again, and of the pack of hounds which they had taken with them, none were seen more. From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest, and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for many years, when a strange huntsman announced himself to the King as seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The King, however, would not give his consent, and said, “It is not safe in there; I fear it would fare with thee no better than with the others, and thou wouldst never come out again.” The huntsman replied, “Lord, I will venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.”"
"The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of the water, seized it, and drew it under, When the huntsman saw that, he went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There was great astonishment over the wild man; the King, however, had him put in an iron cage in his court-yard, and forbade the door to be opened on pain of death, and the Queen herself was to take the key into her keeping. And from this time forth every one could again go into the forest with safety."
"The King had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the court-yard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage. The boy ran thither and said, “Give me my ball out.” “Not till thou hast opened the door for me,” answered the man. “No,” said the boy, “I will not do that; the King has forbidden it,” and ran away. The next day he again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said, “Open my door,” but the boy would not. On the third day the King had ridden out hunting, and the boy went once more and said, “I cannot open the door even if I wished, for I have not the key.” Then the wild man said, “It lies under thy mother’s pillow, thou canst get it there.” The boy, who wanted to have his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him, “Oh, wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!”"
"The wild man turned back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps into the forest. When the King came home, he observed the empty cage, and asked the Queen how that had happened? She knew nothing about it, and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one answered. The King sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and much grief reigned in the royal court."
"“Heart alive! What can one desire more?” said the servant to himself, and went merrily onwards. Soon afterwards he met a Jew with a long goat’s-beard, who was standing listening to the song of a bird which was sitting up at the top of a tree. “Good heavens,” he was exclaiming, “that such a small creature should have such a fearfully loud voice! If it were but mine! If only someone would sprinkle some salt upon its tail!”"
"“If that is all,” said the servant, “the bird shall soon be down here;”"
"And taking aim he pulled the trigger, and down fell the bird into the thorn-bushes. “Go, you rogue,” he said to the Jew, “and fetch the bird out for yourself!”"
"“Oh!” said the Jew, “leave out the rogue, my master, and I will do it at once. I will get the bird out for myself, as you really have hit it.” Then he lay down on the ground, and began to crawl into the thicket."
"When he was fast among the thorns, the good servant’s humor so tempted him that he took up his fiddle and began to play. In a moment the Jew’s legs began to move, and to jump into the air, and the more the servant fiddled the better went the dance. But the thorns tore his shabby coat from him, combed his beard, and pricked and plucked him all over the body. “Oh dear,” cried the Jew, “what do I want with your fiddling?"
"Leave the fiddle alone, master; I do not want to dance.”"
"But the servant did not listen to him, and thought, “You have fleeced people often enough, now the thorn-bushes shall do the same to you;”"
"and he began to play over again, so that the Jew had to jump higher than ever, and scraps of his coat were left hanging on the thorns. “Oh, woe’s me! cried the Jew; I will give the gentleman whatsoever he asks if only he leaves off fiddling a purse full of gold.” “If you are so liberal,” said the servant, “I will stop my music; but this I must say to your credit, that you dance to it so well that it is quite an art;”"
and having taken the purse he went his way.
"The Jew stood still and watched the servant quietly until he was far off and out of sight, and then he screamed out with all his might, “You miserable musician, you beer-house fiddler! wait till I catch you alone, I will hunt you till the soles of your shoes fall off! You ragamuffin! just put five farthings in your mouth, and then you may be worth three halfpence!” and went on abusing him as fast as he could speak. As soon as he had refreshed himself a little in this way, and got his breath again, he ran into the town to the justice."
"“My lord judge,” he said, “I have come to make a complaint; see how a rascal has robbed and ill-treated me on the public highway! a stone on the ground might pity me; my clothes all torn, my body pricked and scratched, my little all gone with my purse, good ducats, each piece better than the last; for God’s sake let the man be thrown into prison!”"
"“Was it a soldier,” said the judge, “who cut you thus with his sabre?”"
"“Nothing of the sort!” said the Jew; “it was no sword that he had, but a gun hanging at his back, and a fiddle at his neck; the wretch may easily be known.”"
"So the judge sent his people out after the man, and they found the good servant, who had been going quite slowly along, and they found, too, the purse with the money upon him. As soon as he was taken before the judge he said, “I did not touch the Jew, nor take his money; he gave it to me of his own free will, that I might leave off fiddling because he could not bear my music.” “Heaven defend us!” cried the Jew, “his lies are as thick as flies upon the wall.”"
"But the judge also did not believe his tale, and said, “This is a bad defence, no Jew would do that.” And because he had committed robbery on the public highway, he sentenced the good servant to be hanged. As he was being led away the Jew again screamed after him, “You vagabond! you dog of a fiddler! now you are going to receive your well-earned reward!” The servant walked quietly with the hangman up the ladder, but upon the last step he turned round and said to the judge, “Grant me just one request before I die.”"
"“Yes, if you do not ask your life,” said the judge. “I do not ask for life,” answered the servant, “but as a last favor let me play once more upon my fiddle.” The Jew raised a great cry of “Murder! murder! for goodness’ sake do not allow it! Do not allow it!” But the judge said, “Why should I not let him have this short pleasure? it has been granted to him, and he shall have it.” However, he could not have refused on account of the gift which had been bestowed on the servant."
"Then the Jew cried, “Oh! woe’s me! tie me, tie me fast!” while the good servant took his fiddle from his neck, and made ready. As he gave the first scrape, they all began to quiver and shake, the judge, his clerk, and the hangman and his men, and the cord fell out of the hand of the one who was going to tie the Jew fast. At the second scrape all raised their legs, and the hangman let go his hold of the good servant, and made himself ready to dance. At the third scrape they all leaped up and began to dance; the judge and the Jew being the best at jumping. Soon all who had gathered in the market-place out of curiosity were dancing with them; old and young, fat and lean, one with another. The dogs, likewise, which had run there got up on their hind legs and capered about; and the longer he played, the higher sprang the dancers, so that they knocked against each other’s heads, and began to shriek terribly."
"At length the judge cried, quite out of breath, “I will give you your life if you will only stop fiddling.” The good servant thereupon had compassion, took his fiddle and hung it round his neck again, and stepped down the ladder. Then he went up to the Jew, who was lying upon the ground panting for breath, and said, “You rascal, now confess, whence you got the money, or I will take my fiddle and begin to play again.” “I stole it, I stole it!” cried he; “but you have honestly earned it.” So the judge had the Jew taken to the gallows and hanged as a thief."
111 The Skilful Huntsman
"There was once a young fellow who had learnt the trade of locksmith, and told his father he would now go out into the world and seek his fortune. “Very well,” said the father, “I am quite content with that,”"
"and gave him some money for his journey. So he travelled about and looked for work. After a time he resolved not to follow the trade of locksmith any more, for he no longer liked it, but he took a fancy for hunting. Then there met him in his rambles a huntsman dressed in green, who asked whence he came and whither he was going? The youth said he was a locksmith’s apprentice, but that the trade no longer pleased him, and he had a liking for huntsmanship, would he teach it to him? “Oh, yes,” said the huntsman, “if thou wilt go with me.” Then the young fellow went with him, bound himself to him for some years, and learnt the art of hunting. After this he wished to try his luck elsewhere, and the huntsman gave him nothing in the way of payment but an air-gun, which had, however, this property, that it hit its mark without fail whenever he shot with it. Then he set out and found himself in a very large forest, which he could not get to the end of in one day. When evening came he seated himself in a high tree in order to escape from the wild beasts. Towards midnight, it seemed to him as if a tiny little light glimmered in the distance. Then he looked down through the branches towards it, and kept well in his mind where it was. But in the first place he took off his hat and threw it down in the direction of the light, so that he might go to the hat as a mark when he had descended. Then he got down and went to his hat, put it on again and went straight forwards. The farther he went, the larger the light grew, and when he got close to it he saw that it was an enormous fire, and that three giants were sitting by it, who had an ox on the spit, and were roasting it. Presently one of them said, “I must just taste if the meat will soon be fit to eat,” and pulled a piece off, and was about to put it in his mouth when the huntsman shot it out of his hand. “Well, really,” said the giant, “if the wind has not blown the bit out of my hand!” and helped himself to another. But when he was just about to bite into it, the huntsman again shot it away from him. On this the giant gave the one who was sitting next him a box on the ear, and cried angrily, “Why art thou snatching my piece away from me?” “I have not snatched it away,” said the other, “a sharpshooter must have shot it away from thee.” The giant took another piece, but could not, however, keep it in his hand, for the huntsman shot it out. Then the giant said, “That must be a good shot to shoot the bit out of one’s very mouth, such an one would be useful to us.” And he cried aloud, “Come here, thou sharpshooter, seat thyself at the fire beside us and eat thy fill, we will not hurt thee; but if thou wilt not come, and we have to bring thee by force, thou art a lost man!” On this the youth went up to them and told them he was a skilled huntsman, and that whatever he aimed at with his gun, he was certain to hit. Then they said if he would go with them he should be well treated, and they told him that outside the forest there was a great lake, behind which stood a tower, and in the tower was imprisoned a lovely princess, whom they wished very much to carry off. “Yes,” said he, “I will soon get her for you.” Then they added, “But there is still something else, there is a tiny little dog, which begins to bark directly any one goes near, and as soon as it barks every one in the royal palace wakens up, and for this reason we cannot get there; canst thou undertake to shoot it dead?” “Yes,” said he, “that will be a little bit of fun for me.” After this he got into a boat and rowed over the lake, and as soon as he landed, the little dog came running out, and was about to bark, but the huntsman took his air-gun and shot it dead. When the giants saw that, they rejoiced, and thought they already had the King’s daughter safe, but the huntsman wished first to see how matters stood, and told them that they must stay outside until he called them. Then he went into the castle, and all was perfectly quiet within, and every one was asleep. When he opened the door of the first room, a sword was hanging on the wall which was made of pure silver, and there was a golden star on it, and the name of the King, and on a table near it lay a sealed letter which he broke open, and inside it was written that whosoever had the sword could kill everything which opposed him. So he took the sword from the wall, hung it at his side and went onwards: then he entered the room where the King’s daughter was lying sleeping, and she was so beautiful that he stood still and, holding his breath, looked at her. He thought to himself, “How can I give an innocent maiden into the power of the wild giants, who have evil in their minds?” He looked about further, and under the bed stood a pair of slippers, on the right one was her father’s name with a star, and on the left her own name with a star."
"She wore also a great neck-kerchief of silk embroidered with gold, and on the right side was her father’s name, and on the left her own, all in golden letters. Then the huntsman took a pair of scissors and cut the right corner off, and put it in his knapsack, and then he also took the right slipper with the King’s name, and thrust that in. Now the maiden still lay sleeping, and she was quite sewn into her night-dress, and he cut a morsel from this also, and thrust it in with the rest, but he did all without touching her. Then he went forth and left her lying asleep undisturbed, and when he came to the gate again, the giants were still standing outside waiting for him, and expecting that he was bringing the princess. But he cried to them that they were to come in, for the maiden was already in their power, that he could not open the gate to them, but there was a hole through which they must creep. Then the first approached, and the huntsman wound the giant’s hair round his hand, pulled the head in, and cut it off at one stroke with his sword, and then drew the rest of him in. He called to the second and cut his head off likewise, and then he killed the third also, and he was well pleased that he had freed the beautiful maiden from her enemies, and he cut out their tongues and put them in his knapsack. Then thought he, “I will go home to my father and let him see what I have already done, and afterwards I will travel about the world; the luck which God is pleased to grant me will easily find me.”"
"But when the King in the castle awoke, he saw the three giants lying there dead. So he went into the sleeping-room of his daughter, awoke her, and asked who could have killed the giants? Then said she, “Dear father, I know not, I have been asleep.” But when she arose and would have put on her slippers, the right one was gone, and when she looked at her neck-kerchief it was cut, and the right corner was missing, and when she looked at her night-dress a piece was cut out of it. The King summoned his whole court together, soldiers and every one else who was there, and asked who had set his daughter at liberty, and killed the giants? Now it happened that he had a captain, who was one-eyed and a hideous man, and he said that he had done it. Then the old King said that as he had accomplished this, he should marry his daughter. But the maiden said, “Rather than marry him, dear father, I will go away into the world as far as my legs can carry me.” But the King said that if she would not marry him she should take off her royal garments and wear peasant’s clothing, and go forth, and that she should go to a potter, and begin a trade in earthen vessels. So she put off her royal apparel, and went to a potter and borrowed crockery enough for a stall, and she promised him also that if she had sold it by the evening, she would pay for it. Then the King said she was to seat herself in a corner with it and sell it, and he arranged with some peasants to drive over it with their carts, so that everything should be broken into a thousand pieces. When therefore the King’s daughter had placed her stall in the street, by came the carts, and broke all she had into tiny fragments."
"She began to weep and said, “Alas, how shall I ever pay for the pots now?” The King had, however, wished by this to force her to marry the captain; but instead of that, she again went to the potter, and asked him if he would lend to her once more. He said, “No,” she must first pay for the things she had already had. Then she went to her father and cried and lamented, and said she would go forth into the world. Then said he, “I will have a little hut built for thee in the forest outside, and in it thou shalt stay all thy life long and cook for every one, but thou shalt take no money for it.” When the hut was ready, a sign was hung on the door whereon was written, “To-day given, to-morrow sold.” There she remained a long time, and it was rumored about the world that a maiden was there who cooked without asking for payment, and that this was set forth on a sign outside her door. The huntsman heard it likewise, and thought to himself, “That would suit thee. Thou art poor, and hast no money.” So he took his air-gun and his knapsack, wherein all the things which he had formerly carried away with him from the castle as tokens of his truthfulness were still lying, and went into the forest, and found the hut with the sign, “To-day given, to-morrow sold.” He had put on the sword with which he had cut off the heads of the three giants, and thus entered the hut, and ordered something to eat to be given to him. He was charmed with the beautiful maiden, who was indeed as lovely as any picture. She asked him whence he came and whither he was going, and he said, “I am roaming about the world.” Then she asked him where he had got the sword, for that truly her father’s name was on it. He asked her if she were the King’s daughter. “Yes,” answered she. “With this sword,” said he, “did I cut off the heads of three giants.” And he took their tongues out of his knapsack in proof. Then he also showed her the slipper, and the corner of the neck-kerchief, and the bit of the night-dress. Hereupon she was overjoyed, and said that he was the one who had delivered her. On this they went together to the old King, and fetched him to the hut, and she led him into her room, and told him that the huntsman was the man who had really set her free from the giants. And when the aged King saw all the proofs of this, he could no longer doubt, and said that he was very glad he knew how everything had happened, and that the huntsman should have her to wife, on which the maiden was glad at heart. Then she dressed the huntsman as if he were a foreign lord, and the King ordered a feast to be prepared. When they went to table, the captain sat on the left side of the King’s daughter, but the huntsman was on the right, and the captain thought he was a foreign lord who had come on a visit."
"When they had eaten and drunk, the old King said to the captain that he would set before him something which he must guess. “Supposing any one said that he had killed the three giants and he were asked where the giants’ tongues were, and he were forced to go and look, and there were none in their heads, how could that happen?” The captain said, “Then they cannot have had any.” “Not so,” said the King. “Every animal has a tongue,” and then he likewise asked what any one would deserve who made such an answer? The captain replied, “He ought to be torn in pieces.”"
"Then the King said he had pronounced his own sentence, and the captain was put in prison and then torn in four pieces; but the King’s daughter was married to the huntsman. After this he brought his father and mother, and they lived with their son in happiness, and after the death of the old King he received the kingdom."
112 The Flail From Heaven
"A countryman was once going out to plough with a pair of oxen. When he got to the field, both the animals’ horns began to grow, and went on growing, and when he wanted to go home they were so big that the oxen could not get through the gateway for them. By good luck a butcher came by just then, and he delivered them over to him, and made the bargain in this way, that he should take the butcher a measure of turnip-seed, and then the butcher was to count him out a Brabant thaler for every seed. I call that well sold! The peasant now went home, and carried the measure of turnip-seed to him on his back. On the way, however, he lost one seed out of the bag. The butcher paid him justly as agreed on, and if the peasant had not lost the seed, he would have had one thaler the more. In the meantime, when he went on his way back, the seed had grown into a tree which reached up to the sky. Then thought the peasant, “As thou hast the chance, thou must just see what the angels are doing up there above, and for once have them before thine eyes.” So he climbed up, and saw that the angels above were threshing oats, and he looked on. While he was thus watching them, he observed that the tree on which he was standing, was beginning to totter; he peeped down, and saw that someone was just going to cut it down. “If I were to fall down from hence it would be a bad thing,” thought he, and in his necessity he did not know how to save himself better than by taking the chaff of the oats which lay there in heaps, and twisting a rope of it. He likewise snatched a hoe and a flail which were lying about in heaven, and let himself down by the rope. But he came down on the earth exactly in the middle of a deep, deep hole. So it was a real piece of luck that he had brought the hoe, for he hoed himself a flight of steps with it, and mounted up, and took the flail with him as a token of his truth, so that no one could have any doubt of his story."
113 The Two Kings’ Children
"There was once on a time a King who had a little boy of whom it had been foretold that he should be killed by a stag when he was sixteen years of age, and when he had reached that age the huntsmen once went hunting with him. In the forest, the King’s son was separated from the others, and all at once he saw a great stag which he wanted to shoot, but could not hit. At length he chased the stag so far that they were quite out of the forest, and then suddenly a great tall man was standing there instead of the stag, and said, “It is well that I have thee. I have already ruined six pairs of glass skates with running after thee, and have not been able to get thee.” Then he took the King’s son with him, and dragged him through a great lake to a great palace, and then he had to sit down to table with him and eat something. When they had eaten something together the King said, “I have three daughters, thou must keep watch over the eldest for one night, from nine in the evening till six in the morning, and every time the clock strikes, I will come myself and call, and if thou then givest me no answer, to-morrow morning thou shall be put to death, but if thou always givest me an answer, thou shalt have her to wife.”"
"When the young folks went to the bed-room there stood a stone image of St. Christopher, and the King’s daughter said to it, “My father will come at nine o’clock, and every hour till it strikes three; when he calls, give him an answer instead of the King’s son.” Then the stone image of St. Christopher nodded its head quite quickly, and then more and more slowly till at last it stood still. The next morning the King said to him, “Thou hast done the business well, but I cannot give my daughter away. Thou must now watch a night by my second daughter, and then I will consider with myself, whether thou canst have my eldest daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee, answer me, and if I call thee and thou dost not reply, thy blood shall flow.” Then they both went into the sleeping-room, and there stood a still larger stone image of St. Christopher, and the King’s daughter said to it, “If my father calls, do you answer him.” Then the great stone image of St. Christopher again nodded its head quite quickly and then more and more slowly, until at last it stood still again. And the King’s son lay down on the threshold, put his hand under his head and slept. The next morning the King said to him, “Thou hast done the business really well, but I cannot give my daughter away; thou must now watch a night by the youngest princess, and then I will consider with myself whether thou canst have my second daughter to wife, but I shall come every hour myself, and when I call thee answer me, and if I call thee and thou answerest not, thy blood shall flow for me.”"
"Then they once more went to the sleeping-room together, and there was a much greater and much taller image of St. Christopher than the two first had been. The King’s daughter said to it, “When my father calls, do thou answer.” Then the great tall stone image of St. Christopher nodded quite half an hour with its head, until at length the head stood still again. And the King’s son laid himself down on the threshold of the door and slept. The next morning the King said, “Thou hast indeed watched well, but I cannot give thee my daughter now; I have a great forest, if thou cuttest it down for me between six o’clock this morning and six at night, I will think about it.” Then he gave him a glass axe, a glass wedge, and a glass mallet. When he got into the wood, he began at once to cut, but the axe broke in two, then he took the wedge, and struck it once with the mallet, and it became as short and as small as sand. Then he was much troubled and believed he would have to die, and sat down and wept."
"Adam opened the door respectfully, and the Heavenly Father entered."
"There, in a row, stood the pretty children, and bowed before him, held out their hands, and knelt down. The Lord, however, began to bless them, laid his hands on the first, and said, “Thou shalt be a powerful king;” and to the second, “Thou a prince,” to the third, “Thou a count,” to the fourth, “Thou a knight,” to the fifth, “Thou a nobleman,” to the sixth, “Thou a burgher,” to the seventh, “Thou a merchant,” to the eighth, “Thou a learned man.” He bestowed upon them also all his richest blessings. When Eve saw that the Lord was so mild and gracious, she thought, “I will bring hither my ill-favoured children also, it may be that he will bestow his blessing on them likewise.” So she ran and brought them out of the hay, the straw, the stove, and wherever else she had concealed them. Then came the whole coarse, dirty, shabby, sooty band. The Lord smiled, looked at them all, and said, “I will bless these also.” He laid his hands on the first, and said to him, “Thou shalt be a peasant,” to the second, “Thou a fisherman,” to the third, “Thou a smith,” to the fourth, “Thou a tanner,” to the fifth, “Thou a weaver,” to the sixth, “Thou a shoemaker,” to the seventh, “Thou a tailor,” to the eighth, “Thou a potter,” to the ninth, “Thou a waggoner,” to the tenth, “Thou a sailor,” to the eleventh, “Thou an errand-boy,” to the twelfth, “Thou a scullion all the days of thy life.”"
"When Eve had heard all this she said, “Lord, how unequally thou dividest thy gifts! After all they are all of them my children, whom I have brought into the world, thy favours should be given to all alike.”"
"But God answered, “Eve, thou dost not understand. It is right and necessary that the entire world should be supplied from thy children; if they were all princes and lords, who would grow corn, thresh it, grind and bake it? Who would be blacksmiths, weavers, carpenters, masons, labourers, tailors and seamstresses? Each shall have his own place, so that one shall support the other, and all shall be fed like the limbs of one body.” Then Eve answered, “Ah, Lord, forgive me, I was too quick in speaking to thee. Have thy divine will with my children.”"
181 The Nix of the Mill-Pond
"There was once upon a time a miller who lived with his wife in great contentment. They had money and land, and their prosperity increased year by year more and more. But ill-luck comes like a thief in the night, as their wealth had increased so did it again decrease, year by year, and at last the miller could hardly call the mill in which he lived, his own. He was in great distress, and when he lay down after his day’s work, found no rest, but tossed about in his bed, full of care. One morning he rose before daybreak and went out into the open air, thinking that perhaps there his heart might become lighter. As he was stepping over the mill-dam the first sunbeam was just breaking forth, and he heard a rippling sound in the pond. He turned round and perceived a beautiful woman, rising slowly out of the water. Her long hair, which she was holding off her shoulders with her soft hands, fell down on both sides, and covered her white body. He soon saw that she was the Nix of the Mill-pond, and in his fright did not know whether he should run away or stay where he was. But the nix made her sweet voice heard, called him by his name, and asked him why he was so sad? The miller was at first struck dumb, but when he heard her speak so kindly, he took heart, and told her how he had formerly lived in wealth and happiness, but that now he was so poor that he did not know what to do."
"“Be easy,” answered the nix, “I will make thee richer and happier than thou hast ever been before, only thou must promise to give me the young thing which has just been born in thy house.” “What else can that be,”"
"thought the miller, “but a young puppy or kitten?” and he promised her what she desired. The nix descended into the water again, and he hurried back to his mill, consoled and in good spirits. He had not yet reached it, when the maid-servant came out of the house, and cried to him to rejoice, for his wife had given birth to a little boy. The miller stood as if struck by lightning; he saw very well that the cunning nix had been aware of it, and had cheated him. Hanging his head, he went up to his wife’s bedside and when she said, “Why dost thou not rejoice over the fine boy?” he told her what had befallen him, and what kind of a promise he had given to the nix. “Of what use to me are riches and prosperity?” he added, “if I am to lose my child; but what can I do?” Even the relations, who had come thither to wish them joy, did not know what to say. In the meantime prosperity again returned to the miller’s house. All that he undertook succeeded, it was as if presses and coffers filled themselves of their own accord, and as if money multiplied nightly in the cupboards. It was not long before his wealth was greater than it had ever been before. But he could not rejoice over it untroubled, for the bargain which he had made with the nix tormented his soul. Whenever he passed the mill-pond, he feared she might ascend and remind him of his debt. He never let the boy himself go near the water. “Beware,” he said to him, “if thou dost but touch the water, a hand will rise, seize thee, and draw thee down.” But as year after year went by and the nix did not show herself again, the miller began to feel at ease. The boy grew up to be a youth and was apprenticed to a huntsman. When he had learnt everything, and had become an excellent huntsman, the lord of the village took him into his service. In the village lived a beautiful and true-hearted maiden, who pleased the huntsman, and when his master perceived that, he gave him a little house, the two were married, lived peacefully and happily, and loved each other with all their hearts."
"One day the huntsman was chasing a roe; and when the animal turned aside from the forest into the open country, he pursued it and at last shot it. He did not notice that he was now in the neighbourhood of the dangerous mill-pond, and went, after he had disembowelled the stag, to the water, in order to wash his blood-stained hands. Scarcely, however, had he dipped them in than the nix ascended, smilingly wound her dripping arms around him, and drew him quickly down under the waves, which closed over him. When it was evening, and the huntsman did not return home, his wife became alarmed. She went out to seek him, and as he had often told her that he had to be on his guard against the snares of the nix, and dared not venture into the neighbourhood of the mill-pond, she already suspected what had happened. She hastened to the water, and when she found his hunting-pouch lying on the shore, she could no longer have any doubt of the misfortune. Lamenting her sorrow, and wringing her hands, she called on her beloved by name, but in vain."
"She hurried across to the other side of the pond, and called him anew; she reviled the nix with harsh words, but no answer followed. The surface of the water remained calm, only the crescent moon stared steadily back at her. The poor woman did not leave the pond. With hasty steps, she paced round and round it, without resting a moment, sometimes in silence, sometimes uttering a loud cry, sometimes softly sobbing. At last her strength came to an end, she sank down to the ground and fell into a heavy sleep. Presently a dream took possession of her. She was anxiously climbing upwards between great masses of rock; thorns and briars caught her feet, the rain beat in her face, and the wind tossed her long hair about. When she had reached the summit, quite a different sight presented itself to her; the sky was blue, the air soft, the ground sloped gently downwards, and on a green meadow, gay with flowers of every colour, stood a pretty cottage. She went up to it and opened the door; there sat an old woman with white hair, who beckoned to her kindly. At that very moment, the poor woman awoke, day had already dawned, and she at once resolved to act in accordance with her dream. She laboriously climbed the mountain; everything was exactly as she had seen it in the night. The old woman received her kindly, and pointed out a chair on which she might sit. “Thou must have met with a misfortune,” she said, “since thou hast sought out my lonely cottage.”"
"With tears, the woman related what had befallen her. “Be comforted,”"
"said the old woman, “I will help thee. Here is a golden comb for thee."
"Tarry till the full moon has risen, then go to the mill-pond, seat thyself on the shore, and comb thy long black hair with this comb. When thou hast done, lay it down on the bank, and thou wilt see what will happen.” The woman returned home, but the time till the full moon came, passed slowly. At last the shining disc appeared in the heavens, then she went out to the mill-pond, sat down and combed her long black hair with the golden comb, and when she had finished, she laid it down at the water’s edge. It was not long before there was a movement in the depths, a wave rose, rolled to the shore, and bore the comb away with it. In not more than the time necessary for the comb to sink to the bottom, the surface of the water parted, and the head of the huntsman arose. He did not speak, but looked at his wife with sorrowful glances."
"At the same instant, a second wave came rushing up, and covered the man’s head. All had vanished, the mill-pond lay peaceful as before, and nothing but the face of the full moon shone on it. Full of sorrow, the woman went back, but again the dream showed her the cottage of the old woman. Next morning she again set out and complained of her woes to the wise woman. The old woman gave her a golden flute, and said, “Tarry till the full moon comes again, then take this flute; play a beautiful air on it, and when thou hast finished, lay it on the sand; then thou wilt see what will happen.” The wife did as the old woman told her. No sooner was the flute lying on the sand than there was a stirring in the depths, and a wave rushed up and bore the flute away with it."
"Immediately afterwards the water parted, and not only the head of the man, but half of his body also arose. He stretched out his arms longingly towards her, but a second wave came up, covered him, and drew him down again. “Alas, what does it profit me?” said the unhappy woman, “that I should see my beloved, only to lose him again!” Despair filled her heart anew, but the dream led her a third time to the house of the old woman. She set out, and the wise woman gave her a golden spinning-wheel, consoled her and said, “All is not yet fulfilled, tarry until the time of the full moon, then take the spinning-wheel, seat thyself on the shore, and spin the spool full, and when thou hast done that, place the spinning-wheel near the water, and thou wilt see what will happen.” The woman obeyed all she said exactly; as soon as the full moon showed itself, she carried the golden spinning-wheel to the shore, and span industriously until the flax came to an end, and the spool was quite filled with the threads. No sooner was the wheel standing on the shore than there was a more violent movement than before in the depths of the pond, and a mighty wave rushed up, and bore the wheel away with it. Immediately the head and the whole body of the man rose into the air, in a water-spout. He quickly sprang to the shore, caught his wife by the hand and fled. But they had scarcely gone a very little distance, when the whole pond rose with a frightful roar, and streamed out over the open country. The fugitives already saw death before their eyes, when the woman in her terror implored the help of the old woman, and in an instant they were transformed, she into a toad, he into a frog. The flood which had overtaken them could not destroy them, but it tore them apart and carried them far away. When the water had dispersed and they both touched dry land again, they regained their human form, but neither knew where the other was; they found themselves among strange people, who did not know their native land. High mountains and deep valleys lay between them. In order to keep themselves alive, they were both obliged to tend sheep. For many long years they drove their flocks through field and forest and were full of sorrow and longing. When spring had once more broken forth on the earth, they both went out one day with their flocks, and as chance would have it, they drew near each other. They met in a valley, but did not recognize each other; yet they rejoiced that they were no longer so lonely. Henceforth they each day drove their flocks to the same place; they did not speak much, but they felt comforted. One evening when the full moon was shining in the sky, and the sheep were already at rest, the shepherd pulled the flute out of his pocket, and played on it a beautiful but sorrowful air. When he had finished he saw that the shepherdess was weeping bitterly. “Why art thou weeping?” he asked."
"“Alas,” answered she, “thus shone the full moon when I played this air on the flute for the last time, and the head of my beloved rose out of the water.” He looked at her, and it seemed as if a veil fell from his eyes, and he recognized his dear wife, and when she looked at him, and the moon shone in his face she knew him also. They embraced and kissed each other, and no one need ask if they were happy."
182 The Little Folks’ Presents
"A tailor and a goldsmith were travelling together, and one evening when the sun had sunk behind the mountains, they heard the sound of distant music, which became more and more distinct. It sounded strange, but so pleasant that they forgot all their weariness and stepped quickly onwards. The moon had already arisen when they reached a hill on which they saw a crowd of little men and women, who had taken each other’s hands, and were whirling round in the dance with the greatest pleasure and delight."
"They sang to it most charmingly, and that was the music which the travellers had heard. In the midst of them sat an old man who was rather taller than the rest. He wore a parti-coloured coat, and his iron-grey beard hung down over his breast. The two remained standing full of astonishment, and watched the dance. The old man made a sign that they should enter, and the little folks willingly opened their circle. The goldsmith, who had a hump, and like all hunchbacks was brave enough, stepped in; the tailor felt a little afraid at first, and held back, but when he saw how merrily all was going, he plucked up his courage, and followed. The circle closed again directly, and the little folks went on singing and dancing with the wildest leaps. The old man, however, took a large knife which hung to his girdle, whetted it, and when it was sufficiently sharpened, he looked round at the strangers."
"They were terrified, but they had not much time for reflection, for the old man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed, shaved the hair of his head clean off, and then the same thing happened to the tailor. But their fear left them when, after he had finished his work, the old man clapped them both on the shoulder in a friendly manner, as much as to say, they had behaved well to let all that be done to them willingly, and without any struggle. He pointed with his finger to a heap of coals which lay at one side, and signified to the travellers by his gestures that they were to fill their pockets with them. Both of them obeyed, although they did not know of what use the coals would be to them, and then they went on their way to seek a shelter for the night. When they had got into the valley, the clock of the neighbouring monastery struck twelve, and the song ceased. In a moment all had vanished, and the hill lay in solitude in the moonlight."
"The two travellers found an inn, and covered themselves up on their straw-beds with their coats, but in their weariness forgot to take the coals out of them before doing so. A heavy weight on their limbs awakened them earlier than usual. They felt in the pockets, and could not believe their eyes when they saw that they were not filled with coals, but with pure gold; happily, too, the hair of their heads and beards was there again as thick as ever."
"They had now become rich folks, but the goldsmith, who, in accordance with his greedy disposition, had filled his pockets better, was as rich again as the tailor. A greedy man, even if he has much, still wishes to have more, so the goldsmith proposed to the tailor that they should wait another day, and go out again in the evening in order to bring back still greater treasures from the old man on the hill. The tailor refused, and said, “I have enough and am content; now I shall be a master, and marry my dear object (for so he called his sweetheart), and I am a happy man.” But he stayed another day to please him. In the evening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders that he might be able to stow away a great deal, and took the road to the hill."
"He found, as on the night before, the little folks at their singing and dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean, and signed to him to take some coal away with him. He was not slow about sticking as much into his bags as would go, went back quite delighted, and covered himself over with his coat. “Even if the gold does weigh heavily,” said he, “I will gladly bear that,” and at last he fell asleep with the sweet anticipation of waking in the morning an enormously rich man."
"When he opened his eyes, he got up in haste to examine his pockets, but how amazed he was when he drew nothing out of them but black coals, and that howsoever often he put his hands in them. “The gold I got the night before is still there for me,” thought he, and went and brought it out, but how shocked he was when he saw that it likewise had again turned into coal. He smote his forehead with his dusty black hand, and then he felt that his whole head was bald and smooth, as was also the place where his beard should have been. But his misfortunes were not yet over; he now remarked for the first time that in addition to the hump on his back, a second, just as large, had grown in front on his breast. Then he recognized the punishment of his greediness, and began to weep aloud. The good tailor, who was wakened by this, comforted the unhappy fellow as well as he could, and said, “Thou hast been my comrade in my travelling time; thou shalt stay with me and share in my wealth.” He kept his word, but the poor goldsmith was obliged to carry the two humps as long as he lived, and to cover his bald head with a cap."
183 The Giant and the Tailor
"A certain tailor who was great at boasting but ill at doing, took it into his head to go abroad for a while, and look about the world. As soon as he could manage it, he left his workshop, and wandered on his way, over hill and dale, sometimes hither, sometimes thither, but ever on and on. Once when he was out he perceived in the blue distance a steep hill, and behind it a tower reaching to the clouds, which rose up out of a wild dark forest. “Thunder and lightning,” cried the tailor, “what is that?” and as he was strongly goaded by curiosity, he went boldly towards it. But what made the tailor open his eyes and mouth when he came near it, was to see that the tower had legs, and leapt in one bound over the steep hill, and was now standing as an all powerful giant before him. “What dost thou want here, thou tiny fly’s leg?”"
"cried the giant, with a voice as if it were thundering on every side."
"The tailor whimpered, “I want just to look about and see if I can earn a bit of bread for myself, in this forest.” “If that is what thou art after,” said the giant, “thou mayst have a place with me.” “If it must be, why not? What wages shall I receive?” “Thou shalt hear what wages thou shalt have. Every year three hundred and sixty-five days, and when it is leap-year, one more into the bargain. Does that suit thee?” “All right,” replied the tailor, and thought, in his own mind, “a man must cut his coat according to his cloth; I will try to get away as fast as I can.” On this the giant said to him, “Go, little ragamuffin, and fetch me a jug of water.” “Had I not better bring the well itself at once, and the spring too?” asked the boaster, and went with the pitcher to the water. “What! the well and the spring too,” growled the giant in his beard, for he was rather clownish and stupid, and began to be afraid. “That knave is not a fool, he has a wizard in his body. Be on thy guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for thee.” When the tailor had brought the water, the giant bade him go into the forest, and cut a couple of blocks of wood and bring them back. “Why not the whole forest, at once, with one stroke. The whole forest, young and old, with all that is there, both rough and smooth?” asked the little tailor, and went to cut the wood. “What! the whole forest, young and old, with all that is there, both rough and smooth, and the well and its spring too,”"
"growled the credulous giant in his beard, and was still more terrified."
"“The knave can do much more than bake apples, and has a wizard in his body. Be on thy guard, old Hans, this is no serving-man for thee!” When the tailor had brought the wood, the giant commanded him to shoot two or three wild boars for supper. “Why not rather a thousand at one shot, and bring them all here?” inquired the ostentatious tailor. “What!”"
"cried the timid giant in great terror; “Let well alone to-night, and lie down to rest.”"
"The giant was so terribly alarmed that he could not close an eye all night long for thinking what would be the best way to get rid of this accursed sorcerer of a servant. Time brings counsel. Next morning the giant and the tailor went to a marsh, round which stood a number of willow-trees. Then said the giant, “Hark thee, tailor, seat thyself on one of the willow-branches, I long of all things to see if thou art big enough to bend it down.” All at once the tailor was sitting on it, holding his breath, and making himself so heavy that the bough bent down. When, however, he was compelled to draw breath, it hurried him (for unfortunately he had not put his goose in his pocket) so high into the air that he never was seen again, and this to the great delight of the giant. If the tailor has not fallen down again, he must be hovering about in the air."
"His courage had already grown so great that he obeyed the order. The stone began to give way under his feet, and sank slowly down into the depths. When it was once more firm, and the tailor looked round, he found himself in a hall which in size resembled the former. Here, however, there was more to look at and to admire. Hollow places were cut in the walls, in which stood vases of transparent glass which were filled with colored spirit or with a bluish vapour. On the floor of the hall two great glass chests stood opposite to each other, which at once excited his curiosity. When he went to one of them he saw inside it a handsome structure like a castle surrounded by farm-buildings, stables and barns, and a quantity of other good things. Everything was small, but exceedingly carefully and delicately made, and seemed to be cut out by a dexterous hand with the greatest exactitude."
"He might not have turned away his eyes from the consideration of this rarity for some time, if the voice had not once more made itself heard."
"It ordered him to turn round and look at the glass chest which was standing opposite. How his admiration increased when he saw therein a maiden of the greatest beauty! She lay as if asleep, and was wrapped in her long fair hair as in a precious mantle. Her eyes were closely shut, but the brightness of her complexion and a ribbon which her breathing moved to and fro, left no doubt that she was alive. The tailor was looking at the beauty with beating heart, when she suddenly opened her eyes, and started up at the sight of him in joyful terror. “Just Heaven!” cried she, “my deliverance is at hand! Quick, quick, help me out of my prison; if thou pushest back the bolt of this glass coffin, then I shall be free.” The tailor obeyed without delay, and she immediately raised up the glass lid, came out and hastened into the corner of the hall, where she covered herself with a large cloak. Then she seated herself on a stone, ordered the young man to come to her, and after she had imprinted a friendly kiss on his lips, she said, “My long-desired deliverer, kind Heaven has guided thee to me, and put an end to my sorrows. On the self-same day when they end, shall thy happiness begin. Thou art the husband chosen for me by Heaven, and shalt pass thy life in unbroken joy, loved by me, and rich to overflowing in every earthly possession. Seat thyself, and listen to the story of my life:"
"“I am the daughter of a rich count. My parents died when I was still in my tender youth, and recommended me in their last will to my elder brother, by whom I was brought up. We loved each other so tenderly, and were so alike in our way of thinking and our inclinations, that we both embraced the resolution never to marry, but to stay together to the end of our lives. In our house there was no lack of company; neighbors and friends visited us often, and we showed the greatest hospitality to every one. So it came to pass one evening that a stranger came riding to our castle, and, under pretext of not being able to get on to the next place, begged for shelter for the night. We granted his request with ready courtesy, and he entertained us in the most agreeable manner during supper by conversation intermingled with stories. My brother liked the stranger so much that he begged him to spend a couple of days with us, to which, after some hesitation, he consented. We did not rise from table until late in the night, the stranger was shown to room, and I hastened, as I was tired, to lay my limbs in my soft bed. Hardly had I slept for a short time, when the sound of faint and delightful music awoke me. As I could not conceive from whence it came, I wanted to summon my waiting-maid who slept in the next room, but to my astonishment I found that speech was taken away from me by an unknown force. I felt as if a mountain were weighing down my breast, and was unable to make the very slightest sound. In the meantime, by the light of my night-lamp, I saw the stranger enter my room through two doors which were fast bolted. He came to me and said, that by magic arts which were at his command, he had caused the lovely music to sound in order to awaken me, and that he now forced his way through all fastenings with the intention of offering me his hand and heart. My repugnance to his magic arts was, however, so great, that I vouchsafed him no answer. He remained for a time standing without moving, apparently with the idea of waiting for a favorable decision, but as I continued to keep silence, he angrily declared he would revenge himself and find means to punish my pride, and left the room. I passed the night in the greatest disquietude, and only fell asleep towards morning. When I awoke, I hurried to my brother, but did not find him in his room, and the attendants told me that he had ridden forth with the stranger to the chase by daybreak."
"“I at once suspected nothing good. I dressed myself quickly, ordered my palfrey to be saddled, and accompanied only by one servant, rode full gallop to the forest. The servant fell with his horse, and could not follow me, for the horse had broken its foot. I pursued my way without halting, and in a few minutes I saw the stranger coming towards me with a beautiful stag which he led by a cord. I asked him where he had left my brother, and how he had come by this stag, out of whose great eyes I saw tears flowing. Instead of answering me, he began to laugh loudly. I fell into a great rage at this, pulled out a pistol and discharged it at the monster; but the ball rebounded from his breast and went into my horse’s head. I fell to the ground, and the stranger muttered some words which deprived me of consciousness."
"“When I came to my senses again I found myself in this underground cave in a glass coffin. The magician appeared once again, and said he had changed my brother into a stag, my castle with all that belonged to it, diminished in size by his arts, he had shut up in the other glass chest, and my people, who were all turned into smoke, he had confined in glass bottles. He told me that if I would now comply with his wish, it was an easy thing for him to put everything back in its former state, as he had nothing to do but open the vessels, and everything would return once more to its natural form. I answered him as little as I had done the first time. He vanished and left me in my prison, in which a deep sleep came on me. Amongst the visions which passed before my eyes, that was the most comforting in which a young man came and set me free, and when I opened my eyes to-day I saw thee, and beheld my dream fulfilled. Help me to accomplish the other things which happened in those visions. The first is that we lift the glass chest in which my castle is enclosed, on to that broad stone.”"
"As soon as the stone was laden, it began to rise up on high with the maiden and the young man, and mounted through the opening of the ceiling into the upper hall, from whence they then could easily reach the open air. Here the maiden opened the lid, and it was marvellous to behold how the castle, the houses, and the farm buildings which were enclosed, stretched themselves out and grew to their natural size with the greatest rapidity. After this, the maiden and the tailor returned to the cave beneath the earth, and had the vessels which were filled with smoke carried up by the stone. The maiden had scarcely opened the bottles when the blue smoke rushed out and changed itself into living men, in whom she recognized her servants and her people. Her joy was still more increased when her brother, who had killed the magician in the form of the bull, came out of the forest towards them in his human form, and on the self-same day the maiden, in accordance with her promise, gave her hand at the altar to the lucky tailor."
164 Lazy Harry
"Harry was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but drive his goat daily to pasture, he nevertheless groaned when he went home after his day’s work was done. “It is indeed a heavy burden,” said he, “and a wearisome employment to drive a goat into the field this way year after year, till late into the autumn! If one could but lie down and sleep, but no, one must have one’s eyes open lest it hurts the young trees, or squeezes itself through the hedge into a garden, or runs away altogether. How can one have any rest, or peace of one’s life?” He seated himself, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could set his shoulders free from this burden. For a long time all thinking was to no purpose, but suddenly it was as if scales fell from his eyes. “I know what I will do,” he cried, “I will marry fat Trina who has also a goat, and can take mine out with hers, and then I shall have no more need to trouble myself.”"
"So Harry got up, set his weary legs in motion, and went right across the street, for it was no farther, to where the parents of fat Trina lived, and asked for their industrious and virtuous daughter in marriage. The parents did not reflect long. “Birds of a feather, flock together,” they thought, and consented."
"So fat Trina became Harry’s wife, and led out both the goats. Harry had a good time of it, and had no work that he required to rest from but his own idleness. He only went out with her now and then, and said, “I merely do it that I may afterwards enjoy rest more, otherwise one loses all feeling for it.”"
"But fat Trina was no less idle. “Dear Harry,” said she one day, “why should we make our lives so toilsome when there is no need for it, and thus ruin the best days of our youth? Would it not be better for us to give the two goats which disturb us every morning in our sweetest sleep with their bleating, to our neighbor, and he will give us a beehive for them. We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and trouble ourselves no more about it. Bees do not require to be taken care of, or driven into the field; they fly out and find the way home again for themselves, and collect honey without giving the very least trouble.” “Thou hast spoken like a sensible woman,” replied Harry. “We will carry out thy proposal without delay, and besides all that, honey tastes better and nourishes one better than goat’s milk, and it can be kept longer too.”"
"The neighbor willingly gave a beehive for the two goats. The bees flew in and out from early morning till late evening without ever tiring, and filled the hive with the most beautiful honey, so that in autumn Harry was able to take a whole pitcherful out of it."
"They placed the jug on a board which was fixed to the wall of their bed-room, and as they were afraid that it might be stolen from them, or that the mice might find it, Trina brought in a stout hazel-stick and put it beside her bed, so that without unnecessary getting up she might reach it with her hand, and drive away the uninvited guests. Lazy Harry did not like to leave his bed before noon. “He who rises early,” said he, “wastes his substance.”"
"One morning when he was still lying amongst the feathers in broad daylight, resting after his long sleep, he said to his wife, “Women are fond of sweet things, and thou art always tasting the honey in private; it will be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before thou eatest up the whole of it.” “But,” answered Trina, “not before we have a child to take care of them! Am I to worry myself with the little geese, and spend all my strength on them to no purpose.” “Dost thou think,” said Harry, “that the youngster will look after geese? Now-a-days children no longer obey, they do according to their own fancy, because they consider themselves cleverer than their parents, just like that lad who was sent to seek the cow and chased three blackbirds.” “Oh,” replied Trina, “this one shall fare badly if he does not do what I say! I will take a stick and belabour his skin for him with more blows than I can count. Look, Harry,” cried she in her zeal, and seized the stick which she had to drive the mice away with, “Look, this is the way I will fall on him!” She reached her arm out to strike, but unhappily hit the honey-pitcher above the bed. The pitcher struck against the wall and fell down in fragments, and the fine honey streamed down on the ground. “There lie the goose and the young gosling,” said Harry, “and want no looking after. But it is lucky that the pitcher did not fall on my head. We have all reason to be satisfied with our lot.” And then as he saw that there was still some honey in one of the fragments he stretched out his hand for it, and said quite gaily, “The remains, my wife, we will still eat with a relish, and we will rest a little after the fright we have had. What matters if we do get up a little later the day is always long enough.”"
"“Yes,” answered Trina, “we shall always get to the end of it at the proper time. Dost thou know that the snail was once asked to a wedding and set out to go, but arrived at the christening. In front of the house it fell over the fence, and said, ‘Speed does no good.’”"
165 The Griffin
"There was once upon a time a King, but where he reigned and what he was called, I do not know. He had no son, but an only daughter who had always been ill, and no doctor had been able to cure her. Then it was foretold to the King that his daughter should eat herself well with an apple. So he ordered it to be proclaimed throughout the whole of his kingdom, that whosoever brought his daughter an apple with which she could eat herself well, should have her to wife, and be King. This became known to a peasant who had three sons, and he said to the eldest, “Go out into the garden and take a basketful of those beautiful apples with the red cheeks and carry them to the court; perhaps the King’s daughter will be able to eat herself well with them, and then thou wilt marry her and be King.” The lad did so, and set out."
"When he had gone a short way he met a little iron man who asked him what he had there in the basket, to which replied Uele, for so was he named, “Frogs’ legs.” On this the little man said, “Well, so shall it be, and remain,” and went away. At length Uele arrived at the palace, and made it known that he had brought apples which would cure the King’s daughter if she ate them. This delighted the King hugely, and he caused Uele to be brought before him; but, alas! when he opened the basket, instead of having apples in it he had frogs’ legs which were still kicking about. On this the King grew angry, and had him driven out of the house. When he got home he told his father how it had fared with him. Then the father sent the next son, who was called Seame, but all went with him just as it had gone with Uele. He also met the little iron man, who asked what he had there in the basket. Seame said, “Hogs’"
"bristles,” and the iron man said, “well, so shall it be, and remain.”"
"When Seame got to the King’s palace and said he brought apples with which the King’s daughter might eat herself well, they did not want to let him go in, and said that one fellow had already been there, and had treated them as if they were fools. Seame, however, maintained that he certainly had the apples, and that they ought to let him go in. At length they believed him, and led him to the King. But when he uncovered the basket, he had but hogs’ bristles. This enraged the King most terribly, so he caused Seame to be whipped out of the house. When he got home he related all that had befallen him, then the youngest boy, whose name was Hans, but who was always called Stupid Hans, came and asked his father if he might go with some apples. “Oh!” said the father, “thou wouldst be just the right fellow for such a thing! If the clever ones can’t manage it, what canst thou do?” The boy, however, did not believe him, and said, “Indeed, father, I wish to go.” “Just get away, thou stupid fellow, thou must wait till thou art wiser,” said the father to that, and turned his back. Hans, however, pulled at the back of his smock-frock and said, “Indeed, father, I wish to go.” “Well, then, so far as I am concerned thou mayst go, but thou wilt soon come home again!” replied the old man in a spiteful voice. The boy, however, was tremendously delighted and jumped for joy. “Well, act like a fool!"
"thou growest more stupid every day!” said the father again. Hans, however, did not care about that, and did not let it spoil his pleasure, but as it was then night, he thought he might as well wait until the morrow, for he could not get to court that day. All night long he could not sleep in his bed, and if he did doze for a moment, he dreamt of beautiful maidens, of palaces, of gold, and of silver, and all kinds of things of that sort. Early in the morning, he went forth on his way, and directly afterwards the little shabby-looking man in his iron clothes, came to him and asked what he was carrying in the basket. Hans gave him the answer that he was carrying apples with which the King’s daughter was to eat herself well. “Then,” said the little man, “so shall they be, and remain.” But at the court they would none of them let Hans go in, for they said two had already been there who had told them that they were bringing apples, and one of them had frogs’ legs, and the other hogs’ bristles. Hans, however, resolutely maintained that he most certainly had no frogs’ legs, but some of the most beautiful apples in the whole kingdom. As he spoke so pleasantly, the door-keeper thought he could not be telling a lie, and asked him to go in, and he was right, for when Hans uncovered his basket in the King’s presence, golden-yellow apples came tumbling out. The King was delighted, and caused some of them to be taken to his daughter, and then waited in anxious expectation until news should be brought to him of the effect they had. But before much time had passed by, news was brought to him: but who do you think it was who came? it was his daughter herself! As soon as she had eaten of those apples, she was cured, and sprang out of her bed. The joy the King felt cannot be described! but now he did not want to give his daughter in marriage to Hans, and said he must first make him a boat which would go quicker on dry land than on water. Hans agreed to the conditions, and went home, and related how it had fared with him. Then the father sent Uele into the forest to make a boat of that kind. He worked diligently, and whistled all the time. At mid-day, when the sun was at the highest, came the little iron man and asked what he was making? Uele gave him for answer, “Wooden bowls for the kitchen.” The iron man said, “So it shall be, and remain.” By evening Uele thought he had now made the boat, but when he wanted to get into it, he had nothing but wooden bowls. The next day Seame went into the forest, but everything went with him just as it had done with Uele. On the third day Stupid Hans went. He worked away most industriously, so that the whole forest resounded with the heavy strokes, and all the while he sang and whistled right merrily. At mid-day, when it was the hottest, the little man came again, and asked what he was making? “A boat which will go quicker on dry land than on the water,” replied Hans, “and when I have finished it, I am to have the King’s daughter for my wife.” “Well,”"
"said the little man, “such an one shall it be, and remain.” In the evening, when the sun had turned into gold, Hans finished his boat, and all that was wanted for it. He got into it and rowed to the palace. The boat went as swiftly as the wind. The King saw it from afar, but would not give his daughter to Hans yet, and said he must first take a hundred hares out to pasture from early morning until late evening, and if one of them got away, he should not have his daughter. Hans was contented with this, and the next day went with his flock to the pasture, and took great care that none of them ran away."
"Before many hours had passed came a servant from the palace, and told Hans that he must give her a hare instantly, for some visitors had come unexpectedly. Hans, however, was very well aware what that meant, and said he would not give her one; the King might set some hare soup before his guest next day. The maid, however, would not believe in his refusal, and at last she began to get angry with him. Then Hans said that if the King’s daughter came herself, he would give her a hare. The maid told this in the palace, and the daughter did go herself. In the meantime, however, the little man came again to Hans, and asked him what he was doing there? He said he had to watch over a hundred hares and see that none of them ran away, and then he might marry the King’s daughter and be King. “Good,” said the little man, “there is a whistle for thee, and if one of them runs away, just whistle with it, and then it will come back again.” When the King’s daughter came, Hans gave her a hare into her apron; but when she had gone about a hundred steps with it, he whistled, and the hare jumped out of the apron, and before she could turn round was back to the flock again. When the evening came the hare-herd whistled once more, and looked to see if all were there, and then drove them to the palace. The King wondered how Hans had been able to take a hundred hares to graze without losing any of them; he would, however, not give him his daughter yet, and said he must now bring him a feather from the Griffin’s tail. Hans set out at once, and walked straight forwards. In the evening he came to a castle, and there he asked for a night’s lodging, for at that time there were no inns. The lord of the castle promised him that with much pleasure, and asked where he was going? Hans answered, “To the Griffin.” “Oh! to the Griffin! They tell me he knows everything, and I have lost the key of an iron money-chest; so you might be so good as to ask him where it is.” “Yes, indeed,” said Hans, “I will do that.” Early the next morning he went onwards, and on his way arrived at another castle in which he again stayed the night. When the people who lived there learnt that he was going to the Griffin, they said they had in the house a daughter who was ill, and that they had already tried every means to cure her, but none of them had done her any good, and he might be so kind as to ask the Griffin what would make their daughter healthy again? Hans said he would willingly do that, and went onwards. Then he came to a lake, and instead of a ferry-boat, a tall, tall man was there who had to carry everybody across. The man asked Hans whither he was journeying?"
"“To the Griffin,” said Hans. “Then when you get to him,” said the man, “just ask him why I am forced to carry everybody over the lake.” “Yes, indeed, most certainly I’ll do that,” said Hans. Then the man took him up on his shoulders, and carried him across. At length Hans arrived at the Griffin’s house, but the wife only was at home, and not the Griffin himself. Then the woman asked him what he wanted? Thereupon he told her everything;—that he had to get a feather out of the Griffin’s tail, and that there was a castle where they had lost the key of their money-chest, and he was to ask the Griffin where it was?—that in another castle the daughter was ill, and he was to learn what would cure her?—and then not far from thence there was a lake and a man beside it, who was forced to carry people across it, and he was very anxious to learn why the man was obliged to do it. Then said the woman, “But look here, my good friend, no Christian can speak to the Griffin; he devours them all; but if you like, you can lie down under his bed, and in the night, when he is quite fast asleep, you can reach out and pull a feather out of his tail, and as for those things which you are to learn, I will ask about them myself.” Hans was quite satisfied with this, and got under the bed. In the evening, the Griffin came home, and as soon as he entered the room, said, “Wife, I smell a Christian.”"
"“Yes,” said the woman, “one was here to-day, but he went away again;”"
and on that the Griffin said no more.
"In the middle of the night when the Griffin was snoring loudly, Hans reached out and plucked a feather from his tail. The Griffin woke up instantly, and said, “Wife, I smell a Christian, and it seems to me that somebody was pulling at my tail.” His wife said, “Thou hast certainly been dreaming, and I told thee before that a Christian was here to-day, but that he went away again. He told me all kinds of things that in one castle they had lost the key of their money-chest, and could find it nowhere.” “Oh! the fools!” said the Griffin; “the key lies in the wood-house under a log of wood behind the door.” “And then he said that in another castle the daughter was ill, and they knew no remedy that would cure her.” “Oh! the fools!” said the Griffin; “under the cellar-steps a toad has made its nest of her hair, and if she got her hair back she would be well.” “And then he also said that there was a place where there was a lake and a man beside it who was forced to carry everybody across.” “Oh, the fool!” said the Griffin; “if he only put one man down in the middle, he would never have to carry another across.” Early the next morning the Griffin got up and went out. Then Hans came forth from under the bed, and he had a beautiful feather, and had heard what the Griffin had said about the key, and the daughter, and the ferry-man. The Griffin’s wife repeated it all once more to him that he might not forget it, and then he went home again. First he came to the man by the lake, who asked him what the Griffin had said, but Hans replied that he must first carry him across, and then he would tell him. So the man carried him across, and when he was over Hans told him that all he had to do was to set one person down in the middle of the lake, and then he would never have to carry over any more. The man was hugely delighted, and told Hans that out of gratitude he would take him once more across, and back again. But Hans said no, he would save him the trouble, he was quite satisfied already, and pursued his way."
"Then he came to the castle where the daughter was ill; he took her on his shoulders, for she could not walk, and carried her down the cellar-steps and pulled out the toad’s nest from beneath the lowest step and gave it into her hand, and she sprang off his shoulder and up the steps before him, and was quite cured. Then were the father and mother beyond measure rejoiced, and they gave Hans gifts of gold and of silver, and whatsoever else he wished for, that they gave him. And when he got to the other castle he went at once into the wood-house, and found the key under the log of wood behind the door, and took it to the lord of the castle. He also was not a little pleased, and gave Hans as a reward much of the gold that was in the chest, and all kinds of things besides, such as cows, and sheep, and goats. When Hans arrived before the King, with all these things—with the money, and the gold, and the silver and the cows, sheep and goats, the King asked him how he had come by them. Then Hans told him that the Griffin gave every one whatsoever he wanted. So the King thought he himself could make such things useful, and set out on his way to the Griffin; but when he got to the lake, it happened that he was the very first who arrived there after Hans, and the man put him down in the middle of it and went away, and the King was drowned. Hans, however, married the daughter, and became King."
166 Strong Hans
"There were once a man and a woman who had an only child, and lived quite alone in a solitary valley. It came to pass that the mother once went into the wood to gather branches of fir, and took with her little Hans, who was just two years old. As it was spring-time, and the child took pleasure in the many-coloured flowers, she went still further onwards with him into the forest. Suddenly two robbers sprang out of the thicket, seized the mother and child, and carried them far away into the black forest, where no one ever came from one year’s end to another. The poor woman urgently begged the robbers to set her and her child free, but their hearts were made of stone, they would not listen to her prayers and entreaties, and drove her on farther by force. After they had worked their way through bushes and briars for about two miles, they came to a rock where there was a door, at which the robbers knocked and it opened at once. They had to go through a long dark passage, and at last came into a great cavern, which was lighted by a fire which burnt on the hearth. On the wall hung swords, sabres, and other deadly weapons which gleamed in the light, and in the midst stood a black table at which four other robbers were sitting gambling, and the captain sat at the head of it. As soon as he saw the woman he came and spoke to her, and told her to be at ease and have no fear, they would do nothing to hurt her, but she must look after the house-keeping, and if she kept everything in order, she should not fare ill with them. Thereupon they gave her something to eat, and showed her a bed where she might sleep with her child."
"The woman stayed many years with the robbers, and Hans grew tall and strong. His mother told him stories, and taught him to read an old book of tales about knights which she found in the cave. When Hans was nine years old, he made himself a strong club out of a branch of fir, hid it behind the bed, and then went to his mother and said, “Dear mother, pray tell me who is my father; I must and will know.” His mother was silent and would not tell him, that he might not become home-sick; moreover she knew that the godless robbers would not let him go away, but it almost broke her heart that Hans should not go to his father. In the night, when the robbers came home from their robbing expedition, Hans brought out his club, stood before the captain, and said, “I now wish to know who is my father, and if thou dost not at once tell me I will strike thee down.” Then the captain laughed, and gave Hans such a box on the ear that he rolled under the table. Hans got up again, held his tongue, and thought, “I will wait another year and then try again, perhaps I shall do better then.” When the year was over, he brought out his club again, rubbed the dust off it, looked at it well, and said, “It is a stout strong club.” At night the robbers came home, drank one jug of wine after another, and their heads began to be heavy. Then Hans brought out his club, placed himself before the captain, and asked him who was his father? But the captain again gave him such a vigorous box on the ear that Hans rolled under the table, but it was not long before he was up again, and beat the captain and the robbers so with his club, that they could no longer move either their arms or their legs. His mother stood in a corner full of admiration of his bravery and strength. When Hans had done his work, he went to his mother, and said, “Now I have shown myself to be in earnest, but now I must also know who is my father.” “Dear Hans,” answered the mother, “come, we will go and seek him until we find him.” She took from the captain the key to the entrance-door, and Hans fetched a great meal-sack and packed into it gold and silver, and whatsoever else he could find that was beautiful, until it was full, and then he took it on his back. They left the cave, but how Hans did open his eyes when he came out of the darkness into daylight, and saw the green forest, and the flowers, and the birds, and the morning sun in the sky. He stood there and wondered at everything just as if he had not been very wise. His mother looked for the way home, and when they had walked for a couple of hours, they got safely into their lonely valley and to their little house. The father was sitting in the doorway. He wept for joy when he recognized his wife and heard that Hans was his son, for he had long regarded them both as dead. But Hans, although he was not twelve years old, was a head taller than his father. They went into the little room together, but Hans had scarcely put his sack on the bench by the stove, than the whole house began to crack the bench broke down and then the floor, and the heavy sack fell through into the cellar. “God save us!” cried the father, “what’s that? Now thou hast broken our little house to pieces!” “Don’t grow any grey hairs about that, dear father,” answered Hans; “there, in that sack, is more than is wanting for a new house.” The father and Hans at once began to build a new house; to buy cattle and land, and to keep a farm. Hans ploughed the fields, and when he followed the plough and pushed it into the ground, the bullocks had scarcely any need to draw. The next spring, Hans said, “Ke"

Before the flotilla regained Dover Harbour the remaining seaplanes

"ON the evening following the return of the ""Sunderland"" to Dover,"
Terence obtained leave to go ashore in order to visit a
"brother-officer who, owing to his ship being under repairs, was"
temporarily installed in the Lord Warden Hotel.
Aubyn was proceeding along the Admiralty Pier when his progress was
"barred by a tall, bronzed young fellow in the uniform of a"
flight-lieutenant of the Naval Air Service.

high that Prowse was discharged.
"PULLING, CAPTAIN JOHN."
"Commanded the _Fame_, which set out in 1703 in company with Dampier in the"
_St. George_ on a plundering expedition to the South Seas. Their
commissions were to attack only Spanish and French ships. The two
"captains quarrelled at the very beginning of the voyage, while lying off"
"the Downs, and Pulling slipped away by himself to go a-pirating amongst"
the Canary Islands.
"PURSSER, CAPTAIN."
In the sixteenth century this pirate became notorious for his piracies off
"the coast of Wales, and with Calles and Clinton, two other pirates, ""grew"

A native of Massachusetts Colony.
"In 1703 was one of the crew of the brigantine _Charles_, eighty tons,"
"owned by some leading citizens of Boston, and fitted out to go"
privateering off the coasts of Arcadia and Newfoundland. On leaving
"Marblehead the crew mutinied, locked the captain in his cabin, and elected"
"Quelch their commander. They sailed to the south, and shortly afterwards"
"threw the captain overboard. They hoisted a flag, the ""Old Roger,"""
"described as having ""in the middle of it an Anatomy with an Hourglars in"
"In February, 1686, Ringrose with one hundred men took the town of Santiago"
"in Mexico, but while returning with the plunder to their ship were caught"
"by the Spaniards in an ambush, and Ringrose was killed."
Ringrose never attained any rank among the buccaneers beyond occasionally
"being put in charge of a boat or a small company on shore, but as a"
recorder of the doings of his companions he proved both careful and
"painstaking. Dampier had a great regard for him, and in his book he"
"writes: ""My ingenious friend Ringrose had no mind to this voyage, but was"
"necessitated to engage in it or starve."""

"When Captain Quelch was captured with his crew, Roach escaped near the"
Cape by Snake Island. He was afterwards captured and thrown into the gaol
"at Salem. Tried for piracy at the Star Tavern at Boston, and on June 30th,"
"1704, was hanged. At the place of execution Roach disappointed the"

"While the German people, under the leadership of Luther, were singing"
"chorales set to original religious poems, a large section of"
"Protestantism, under the influence of John Calvin, confined itself to"
"the singing of Psalms. To the French reformer, now preaching at Geneva,"
"hymns were “man-made,” whereas the psalms were the inspired word of God"
"and the only proper vehicle for the praise of God. Calvin, unlike"
"Luther, was not a musician, and at first permitted only unison singing,"
unaccompanied. Part singing and instrumental accompaniment seemed to
"savor of the frivolous and worldly, an opinion which Calvin, however,"
was soon to modify. For two hundred years the Calvinistic churches on
the Continent and in Britain were influenced in their worship song by
"the strict views of Calvin, limiting themselves to the metrical psalms"
and scriptural paraphrases. The German people in the meantime produced a
"rich treasury of original religious lyrics, contributed by some of their"
best poets.

DERIVATION.--A solution of caustic ammonia in alcohol.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless liquid, having a strong odor of ammonia. This"
preparation of ammonia possesses properties of ammonia and alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, ¹⁄₂ to 1 oz.; sheep and pigs, 1 to 2 drs.;"
"dogs, 10 to 20 m. Should be diluted in water."
SPIRITUS AMMONIAE AROMATICUS--AROMATIC SPIRIT OF AMMONIA
"DERIVATION.--Ammonium carbonate 3.4%, aqua ammonia 9%, oil of lemon 1%,"
"oil of lavender flowers 0.1%, oil of nutmeg 0.1%, alcohol 70%, and"
distilled water to make 100 parts. Diluted in water.
"PROPERTIES.--A nearly colorless liquid when first prepared, but"
gradually acquires an amber color. It has a pungent ammoniacal odor and
taste.
ACTIONS.--These four proportions of ammonia are gastric and general
stimulants. They stimulate the cardiac respiratory and spinal systems.
"USES.--Used in high fever where the temperature must be reduced quickly,"
"as in sun-stroke, acute rheumatism; in man a solution of antipyrine from"
"four to ten per cent strength up, is sprayed into the nostrils for"
hay-fever. Acetanilide is a better and safer and much cheaper drug for
febrile diseases.
AQUA AMMONIAE FORTIOR--STRONGER AMMONIA WATER
"An aqueous solution of ammonia containing twenty-eight per cent, by"
weight of the gas.
DERIVATION.--Evolve ammonia gas by heating ammonium chloride with
calcium hydrate and pass it into water.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless, transparent liquid, having an excessively"
pungent odor and a caustic alkaline taste.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 2 to 4 drs.; sheep and pigs, ¹⁄₂ to 1 dr.;"
"dogs, 5 to 10 m. Should be diluted one drachm to one pint of water."
AQUA AMMONIAE--AMMONIA WATER
An aqueous solution containing ten per cent by weight of ammonia gas.
DERIVATION.--Same as strong ammonia water.
PROPERTIES.--The taste is not so caustic and the odor is less pungent
"Taken prisoner by the pirate Captain Teach on November 21st, 1718, and on"
the very next day retaken by Lieutenant Maynard. Odell received no less
"than seventy wounds in the fight, but recovered, and was carried to"
"Virginia to stand his trial for piracy, and was acquitted."
"OUGHTERLAUNEY, THOMAS."
Acted as pilot in the _Royal Fortune_. Took an active part in taking and
plundering the _King Solomon_ on the West Coast of Africa in 1721.
"Was tried for piracy with the rest of Roberts's crew, when one witness,"
"Captain Trahern, deposed that the prisoner dressed himself up in the"
"captain's best suit of clothes, his new tye wig, and called loudly for a"
"bottle of wine, and then, very arrogantly, gave orders as to the steering"
of the captured ship.
Hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722.
"PAIN, CAPTAIN."
A Bahaman privateer who in 1683 turned pirate and attacked St. Augustine
"in Florida under French colours. Being driven off by the Spaniards, he had"
to content himself with looting some neighbouring settlements. On
"returning to New Providence, the Governor attempted, but without success,"
"to arrest Pain and his crew. Pain afterwards appeared in Rhode Island, and"
"when the authorities tried to seize him and his ship, he got off by"
exhibiting an old commission to hunt for pirates given him a long while
"before by Sir Thomas Lynch. When the West Indies became too hot for him,"
Pain made the coast of Carolina his headquarters.
A Dominican.
"Commanded in 1831 a small gaff-topsail schooner, the _General Morazan_,"
armed with a brass eight-pounder and carrying a mixed crew of forty-four
"men, French, Italian, English, and Creoles of St. Domingo."
"VANCLEIN, CAPTAIN MOSES. Dutch filibuster."
Was serving with L'Ollonais's fleet off the coast of Yucatan when a mutiny
"broke out, of which Vanclein was the ringleader. He persuaded the"
malcontents to sail with him along the coast till they came to Costa Rica.
"There they landed and marched to the town of Veraguas, which they seized"
"and pillaged. The pirates got little booty, only eight pounds of gold, it"
proving to be a poor place.
"VANE, CAPTAIN CHARLES."
"Famous for his piratical activities off the coast of North America,"
specially the Carolinas.
"In 1718, when Woodes Rogers was sent by the English Government to break up"
"the pirate stronghold in the Bahama Islands, all the pirates at New"
Providence Island surrendered to Rogers and received the King's pardon
"except Vane, who, after setting fire to a prize he had, slipped out of the"
bay as Rogers with his two men-of-war entered. Vane sailed to the coast of
"Carolina, as did other West Indian pirates who found their old haunts too"
warm for them.
Vane is first heard of as being actively engaged in stealing from the
Spaniards the silver which they were salving from a wrecked galleon in the
moment a German soldier on leave came up and spat in his face. The
Frenchman felled the German with a resounding box on the ear.
Alarums! Excursions! A German officer rushed up to enquire while the
Frenchman was struggling with two colossal German military policemen
and the Englishman was striving to free him. Vivie explained to the
officer what had occurred. He bowed and saluted: seized the
soldier-spitter by the collar and kicked him so frightfully that
Vivie had to implore him to cease.
Moreover the Red Placards of von Bissing were of increasing
frequency. As a rule Vivie only heard what other people said of
"them, and that wasn't very much, for German spies were everywhere,"
inviting you to follow them to the dreaded Kommandantur in the Rue
de la Loi--a scene of as much in the way of horror and mental
anguish as the Conciergerie of Paris in the days of the Red Terror.
But some cheek-blanching rumour she had heard on a certain Monday in
October caused her to look next day on her way home at a fresh Red
Placard which had been posted up in a public place. The daylight had
"almost faded, but there was a gas lamp which made the notice"
legible. It ran:
CONDAMNATIONS
"Par jugement du 9 Octobre, 1915, le tribunal de campagne a"
prononcé les condamnations suivantes pour trahison commise
pendant l'état de guerre (pour avoir fait passer des recrues
à l'ennemi):
"1° Philippe BAUCQ, architecte à Bruxelles;"
"2° Louise THULIEZ, professeur à Lille;"
"Clement of Alexandria, 170-220, “Shepherd of tender youth” (398)"
"Candle Lighting Hymn, “O gladsome light” (34)"
"Synesius, c. 375-430, “Lord Jesus, think on me” (196)"
"St. Germanus, 634-734, “A great and mighty wonder” (526)"
"St. John of Damascus, 8th century, “The day of resurrection” (115)"
"“Come, ye faithful, raise the strain” (113)"
"St. Stephen the Sabaite, 725-94, “Art thou weary, heavy-laden” (143)"
"Candle Lighting Hymn, “Darkening night, the land doth” (32)"
4. Hymns of the Western Church: Latin.
Two great names are associated with the music of the Western Church:
"Ambrose, c. 340-97, known as the “Father of Hymnody in the Western"
"Church;” and Gregory the Great, 540-604, the missionary-minded pope, and"
reformer of church music.
"Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, not only composed hymns and music but"
stimulated others to do the same. Under his leadership there developed a
"large body of church music based upon four scales, which came to be"
"known as Ambrosian Chant. Although widely known as a scholar,"
"theologian, and preacher, Ambrose’s most lasting influence was upon the"
music of the church. None of his hymns are found in our collection.
"Gregory the Great, two centuries later, carried forward the work of"
"Ambrose. He added four more scales or modes to the Ambrosian system,"
thus giving to the repertory of church music more definiteness and
variety. The music that developed during the papacy of Gregory came to
"be known as Gregorian Chant, or plainsong, or plainchant. It is “plain”"
"because unadorned, unharmonized and unmeasured. Its rhythm is the free"
"rhythm of speech, the beats falling irregularly. The Gregorian Chant"
remained the music of the church for a thousand years and forms the
"Panama is divided into seven provinces, Bocas del Toro, Cocle, Colon,"
"Chiriqui, Los Santos, Panama and Veragua. Its total population by the"
"census of 1911 was 386,749, a trifle more than the District of Columbia"
"which has about one five-thousandth of its area, and almost precisely"
the same population as Montana which has less than half its size. So it
"is clearly not over-populated. Of its population 51,323 are set down by"
"its own census takers as white, 191,933 as mestizo, or a cross between"
"white and Indian, 48,967 as negro; 2313 Mongol, and 14,128 Indian. The"
"census takers estimated that other Indians, living in barbarism remote"
"from civilization and unapproachable by the enumerators, numbered"
"36,138."
[Illustration: NATIVE FAMILY IN CHORRERA]
All these figures have to be qualified somewhat. The mestizos are
"theoretically a cross between whites and Indians, but the negro blood is"
"very generally present. It is doubtful, too, whether those classed as"
white are not often of mixed blood.
A singularly large proportion of the population lives in the towns. In
"12 towns, exceeding 7000 inhabitants each, are more than 150,000 people."
"More than one-third of the people therefore are town dwellers, which is"
to say they are unproductive citizens. Meanwhile more than five-eighths
of the arable land in the country is not under cultivation.
The five chief towns of Panama with their population in 1911 are:
"Panama             37,505"
"Colon              17,748"
"David              15,059"
"Santiago           13,081"
"Bocas del Toro      9,759"
"Rollo bowed, but did not reply, awaiting the general's pleasure."
"Presently Cabrera, recollecting the sealed letter in his hand, gave it"
unopened to the youth.
"""There,"" he said, ""that, I see, is to be opened in the camp of General"
"Cabrera. Well--where Cabrera is, there is his camp. Open it, and let us"
"see what it contains."""
"""I will, general,"" said the young Scot, ""in so far, that is, as it"
"concerns your Excellency."""
The Carlist general sat watching Rollo keenly as he broke the seal and
discovered a couple of enclosures. One was sealed and the other open.
"The first he presented to Cabrera, who, observing the handwriting of the"
"superscription, changed colour. Meanwhile, without paying any attention"
"to him, Rollo read his own communication from beginning to end. It had"
"evidently been passed on to him from a higher authority than the Abbot,"
for only the address was in the handwriting of that learned ecclesiast.
It ran as follows:
"""To the Man who shall be chosen by our trusted Councillor for"
the Mission Extraordinary in the service of Carlos
Quinto--These:
"""You will receive from General Cabrera such succour and"
assistance as may seem to you needful in pursuance of the
"project you have in hand, namely the capturing of the young"
"Princess Isabel together with her mother, the so-called Regent"
Cristina. Thereafter you will bring them with diligence within
"our lines, observing all the respect and courtesy due to their"
exalted rank and to the sex to which they belong.
"_A good many of us, who are now certain beyond a doubt that space"
"travel will forever remain in the realm of the impossible, probably"
"would, if a rocket that were shot to the moon, for instance, did"
"arrive, and perhaps return to give proof of its safe arrival on our"
"satellite, accept the phenomenon in a perfectly blasé, twentieth"
"century manner. Dr. Smith, that phenomenal writer of classic"
"scientific fiction, seems to have become so thoroughly convinced of"
the advent of interplanetary travel that it is difficult for the
"reader to feel, after finishing ""Spacehounds of IPC,"" that travel"
"in the great spaces is not already an established fact. Dr. Smith,"
"as a professional chemist, is kept fairly busy. As a writer, he is"
"satisfied with nothing less than perfection. For that reason, a"
masterpiece from his pen has become almost an annual event. We know
"you will like ""Spacehounds"" even better than the ""Skylark"" series._"

CHAPTER I
The IPV _Arcturus_ Sets Out for Mars
"A narrow football of steel, the Interplanetary Vessel _Arcturus_ stood"
upright in her berth in the dock like an egg in its cup. A hundred feet
"across and a hundred and seventy feet deep was that gigantic bowl, its"
walls supported by the structural steel and concrete of the dock and
"good-sized table, and lays out his materials in front of him. After"
"testing every possible method, the present writer strongly urges the"
"use of individual slips of paper, about 2½ inches by 4 inches. Arranged"
"within easy reach in front of the indexer, but leaving room for the"
"proof-sheets, should be twenty small pasteboard boxes,[48] a little"
larger than the slips themselves.[48] On the inside bottom of each
"box mark a letter of the alphabet, combining O and Q, U and V, and X"
"Y Z. As soon as a slip is written, throw it into its proper box, and"
continue throughout the work. It is a false economy to search out the
"slips for subsequent entries, unless they can be easily found, as it is"
a simple matter at the end to combine the several slips which belong to
the same heading.
"Here are sample slips, showing a heading which requires full entries"
and one to which the text contains fewer references. The first shows a
slip on which the various entries have been combined:
+-------------------------------------------------------+
"| Andastes, the, 5; location and characteristics of,    |"
"|   36; synonyms of, 36; plans for converting, 130;     |"
"|   war with Mohawks, 147; Hurons ask aid from,         |"
"|   162; mortal quarrel with Mohawks, 163; promise      |"
"|   to aid Hurons, 163; Huron fugitives try to reach,   |"
"|   240, 250; Mohawks first to bear brunt of war        |"
"|   with, 268; receive aid from Swedish colonists, 268; |"
"|   attack Senecas, 269; courage their only strength    |"
"|   270; finally overborne by Senecas, 270.             |"

punishment for your impertinence in opening my friend Copplestone's
"private letters. You have had the lesson; profit by it."""
"Dawson flushed angrily. ""Punishment! Impertinence! This to me!"""
"""Yes,"" returned the Admiral stiffly, ""beastly impertinence."""
CHAPTER IV
SABOTAGE
Dawson showed no malice towards the Admiral or myself for our
treatment of him. I do not think that he felt any; he was too fully
occupied in collecting the spoils of victory to trouble his head about
what a Scribbler or a Salt Horse might think of him. He gathered to
himself every scrap of credit which the affair could be induced to
"yield, and received--I admit quite deservedly--the most handsome"
encomiums from his superiors in office. During the two weeks he passed
in my city after the capture--weeks occupied in tracing out the
threads connecting his wretch of a prisoner with the German agents
"upon what Dawson called his ""little list""--he paid several visits both"
to my house and my office. His happiness demanded that he should read
to me the many letters which poured in from high officials of the
"C.I.D., from the Chief Commissioner, and on one day--a day of days in"
the chronicles of Dawson--from the Home Secretary himself. To me it
seemed that all these astute potentates knew their Dawson very
"thoroughly, and lubricated, as it were, with judicious flattery the"
machinery of his energies. I could not but admire Dawson's truly royal
"""Everyman can WILL his own destiny,""--returned Alwyn firmly. ""That is"
"just it. But here we are getting into a serious discussion, and I had"
"determined to talk no more on such subjects till to-night."""
"""And to-night we are to go in for them thoroughly, I"
"suppose?""--inquired Villiers with a quick look. ""To-night, my dear boy,"
"you will have to decide whether you consider me mad or sane,"" said"
"Alwyn cheerfully--""I shall tell you truths that seem like romances--and"
"facts that sound like fables,--moreover, I shall have to assure you"
"that miracles DO happen whenever God chooses, in spite of all human"
denial of their possibility. Do you remember Whately's clever
skit--'Historical Doubts of Napoleon I'?--showing how easy it was to
logically prove that Napoleon never existed?--That ought to enlighten
"people as to the very precise and convincing manner in which we can, if"
"we choose, argue away what is nevertheless an incontestible FACT. Thus"
do skeptics deny miracles--yet we live surrounded by miracles! ... do
"you think me crazed for saying so?"""
"Villiers laughed. ""Crazed! No, indeed!--I wish every man in London were"
"as sane and sound as you are!"""
"""Ah, but wait till to-night!"" and Alwyn's eyes sparkled"
"mirthfully--""Perhaps you will alter your opinion then!""--Here,"
"collecting his scattered manuscripts, he put them by--""I've done work"
"for the present,""--he said--""Shall we go for a walk somewhere?"""
"Villiers assented, and they left the room together."
CHAPTER XXXV.
for a final check-up on directions.
They clambered into the tiny control room and shut the hermetically
sealed trap-door. Brand threw the control switch and precisely at
"eleven o'clock the conical shell of metal shot heavenward, gathering"
such speed that it was soon invisible to human eyes. He set their
"course toward the blazing speck that was Jupiter, four hundred million"
miles away; and then reported their start by radio to Commander
Stone's night operator.
The investigatory expedition to the ominous red spot of the giant of
the solar system was on.
CHAPTER II
_The Pipe-like Men_
Brand began to slacken speed on the morning of the thirteenth day
"(morning, of course, being a technical term: there are no horizons in"
space for the sun to rise over). Jupiter was still an immense distance
"off; but it took a great while to slow the momentum of the space ship,"
"which, in the frictionless emptiness of space, had been traveling"
faster and faster for nearly three hundred hours.
"Behind them was the distant ball of sun, so far off that it looked no"
larger than a red-hot penny. Before them was the gigantic disk of
"Jupiter, given a white tinge by the perpetual fog blankets, its"
outlines softened by its thick layer of atmosphere and cloud banks.
"slow degrees. In the reign of Henry VIII, again, nothing came of"
"the English expeditions of discovery fitted out by him (Schanz,"
"_Englische Handelspolitik_, i, 321), but private voyages were"
"successfully made by traders (_id._ pp. 321, 327)."
"In the seventeenth century, however, and until far on in the"
"eighteenth, all Dutch shipping was more economically managed than"
the English. In all likelihood the Dutch traders knew and improved
upon the systematic control of ship-construction which the
"Venetians and Genoese had first copied from the Byzantines, and in"
"turn developed. (Above, p. 197.) Raleigh was one of the first to"
point out that the broad Dutch boats carried more cargo with fewer
hands than those of any other nation (_Observations touching
"Trade_, in _Works_, ed. 1829, viii, 356). Later in the century"
Petty noted that the Dutch practised freight-economies and
"adaptations of every kind, having different sorts of vessels for"
different kinds of traffic (_Essays in Political Arithmetic_
"[1690], ed. 1699, pp. 179, 180, 182, 183). This again gave them the"
primacy in shipbuilding for the whole of Europe (_Mémoires de Jean
"De Witt_, ptie. i, ch. vi), though they imported all the materials"
"for the purpose. When Colbert began navy-building, his first care"
"was to bring in Dutch shipwrights (Dussieux, _Étude biographique"
"sur Colbert_, 1886, p. 101). Compare, as to the quick sailing of"
"the Dutch, Motley, _United Netherlands_, ed. 1867, iv, 556. In the"
next century the English marine had similar economic advantages
"over the French, which was burdened by royal schemes for"
"multiplying seamen (see Tucker, _Essay on Trade_, 4th ed. p. 37)."
"The frugality which pervaded the whole of Dutch life may, however,"
have had one directly disastrous effect. Sir William Temple noted
that the common people were poorly fed (_Observations upon the
"United Provinces_, ch. iv: Works, ed. 1814, i, 133, 147); and"
"Jay T. Stocking, 1870-1936, “O Master Workman” (93)"
"Wm. M. Vories, 1880—, “Let there be light, Lord God” (353)"
"Harry Webb Farrington, 1880-1931, “I know not how that” (99)"
"W. Russel Bowie, 1882—, “Lord, through changing days” (402)"
"Howard Arnold Walter, 1884-1918, “I would be true” (207)"
"Earl Marlatt, 1892—, “‘Are ye able,’ said the Master” (392)"
11. Gospel Songs.
"During the latter part of the 19th century there came into use, both in"
"the United States and in England, a type of religious song known as the"
"Gospel Song. Less dignified than the chorales or the English hymns,"
these songs made a popular appeal and were widely used in prayer
meetings and revivals.
The words of the typical Gospel Song are usually simple and easily
remembered and concern themselves largely with the individual’s
salvation. The personal pronouns “I” and “my” predominate. The tunes are
rhythmic and catchy and always have a refrain added. Their harmonies are
"largely built on the simple tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords. The"
masses of the people readily learned to sing these tunes and experienced
a thrill in singing them which the use of the more stately and solid
hymns failed to effect.
The great bulk of these songs were produced in America during the latter
half of the 19th century and were found extremely useful in large mass
"meetings. The evangelistic work of Moody and Sankey during the 1870’s,"
"1880’s, and 1890’s brought the Gospel Songs into special prominence and"
the Salvation Army has made them known in nearly every country in the
world. Collections of Gospel Songs sold by the millions of copies and
"every denomination was affected, to a greater or lesser extent, by this"
"SYMPSON, DAVID."
Born at North Berwick.
One of Roberts's crew. Tried and hanged at Cape Coast Castle in 1722. On
the day of execution Sympson was among the first six prisoners to be
brought up from the ship's hold to have their fetters knocked off and to
"be fitted with halters, and it was observed that none of the culprits"
"appeared in the least dejected, except Sympson, who ""spoke a little faint,"
but this was rather imputed to a Flux that had seized him two or three
"days before, than Fear."" There being no clergyman in the colony, a kindly"
"surgeon tried to take on the duties of the ordinary, but with ill-success,"
the hardened ruffians being quite unmoved by his attempts at exhortation.
"In fact, the spectators were considerably shocked, as indeed they well"
"might be, by Sympson, suddenly recognizing among the crowd a woman whom he"
"knew, calling out ""he had lain with that B----h three times, and now she"
"was come to see him hanged."""
"Sympson died at the age of 36, which was considerably above the average"
age to which a pirate might expect to live.
"TAYLOR, CAPTAIN."
"This formidable South Sea pirate must indeed have looked, as well as"
"acted, the part, since his appearance is described by Captain Johnson as"
"follows: ""A Fellow with a terrible pair of Whiskers, and a wooden Leg,"
"being stuck round with Pistols, like the Man in the Almanack with Darts."""
This man Taylor it was who stirred up the crew of the _Victory_ to turn
"70-71, 74-77, 82; as to the general and prolonged resistance of the"
people). During that reign Torquemada is credited with burning ten
"thousand persons in eighteen years (Prescott, _History of Ferdinand"
"and Isabella_, Kirk's ed. 1889, p. 178, citing Llorente. But see p."
"746, _note_, as to possible exaggeration. Cp. Burke, ii, 113;"
"Hume's ed. ii, 84). In the early Lutheran period the spread of"
scholarly Protestantism in Spain was extremely rapid (La
"Rigaudière, _Histoire des persécutions religieuses en Espagne_,"
"1860, p. 245 sq.), and in the early years of Philip II it needed"
"furious persecution to crush it, thousands leaving the kingdom"
"(Prescott, _Philip II_, bk. ii, ch. iii; M'Crie, _Reformation in"
"Spain_, ch. viii; De Castro, _History of the Spanish Protestants_,"
"Eng. tr. 1851, _passim_). At the outset, 800 persons were arrested"
in Seville alone in one day; and the Venetian ambassador in 1562
"testifies to the large number of Huguenots in Spain (Ranke, _Hist."
"of the Popes_, bk. v, Eng. tr. 1-vol. ed. p. 136)."
Had Philip II had Flemish sympathies and chosen to make Brussels
"his capital, the stress of the Inquisition could have fallen on the"
Netherlands as successfully as it actually did on Spain. His
"father's reign had proved as much. According to Motley, not only"
"multitudes of Anabaptists but ""thousands and tens of thousands of"
"virtuous and well-disposed men and women"" had then been ""butchered"
"in cold blood"" (_Rise_, p. 43), without any sign of rebellion on"
"the part of the provinces, whose leading men remained Catholic. In"
"1600 most of the inhabitants of Groningen were Catholics (Davies,"
"ii, 347). A Protestant historian (Grattan, p. 93) admits that the"
"Protestants ""never, and least of all in these days, formed the"
"mass."" Another has admitted, as regards those of Germany, that"
"""nothing had contributed more to the undisturbed progress of their"
"opinions than the interregnum after Maximilian's death, the long"
"absence of Charles, and the slackness of the reins of government"
"If a foetus[54] lacks the right ear, the rule of the king will come"
"to an end, his palace will be destroyed, overthrow of the elders of"
"the city, the king will be without counsellors, confusion in the"
"land, diminution of the cattle in the land, the enemy will acquire"
control[55].
"If the foetus lacks a left ear, a god will harken to the prayer of"
"the king, the king will take the land of his enemy, the palace of the"
"enemy will be destroyed, the enemy will be without a counsellor, the"
"cattle of the enemy's country will be diminished, the enemy will lose"
control.
"If the right ear of the foetus is detached, the stall[56] will be"
destroyed.
"If the left ear of the foetus is detached, the enemy's stall will be"
destroyed.
"If the right ear of the foetus is split, the herd will be destroyed"
or the leaders of the city will leave (it)[57].
"If the left ear of the foetus is split, the herd will be enlarged,"
the leaders of the enemy's country will leave (it).
"If the right ear of the foetus is split and swollen with clay, the"
country [will have a rival].
"If the left ear of the foetus is split and swollen with clay, the"

"If the right ear of the foetus is destroyed, the stall will be"
greenish-gray to grayish brown; each with a flat face and five light
brown filiform ridges and about 16 oil-tubes; odor and taste agreeable
"and aromatic. The anise berries are dried and ground, this being the"
form in which it is usually used.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 1 to 2 oz.; sheep and pigs, 2 to 3 dr.; dogs,"
10 to 30 gr.
OLEUM ANISI--OIL OF ANISE
A volatile oil distilled from the fruit of star anise.
"PROPERTIES.--A colorless or pale yellow, thin and strongly refractive"
"liquid, having the characteristic odor of anise, and a sweetish, mildly"
aromatic taste. Specific gravity about 0.975 to 0.985. Soluble in an
equal volume of alcohol.
"DOSE.--Horses and cattle, 20 to 30 m.; sheep and pigs, 5 to 10 m.; dogs"
"and cats, 1 to 5 m."
"ACTIONS.--Anise is an aromatic stimulant, stomachic and carminative. It"
"is used to relieve indigestion and flatulence, to communicate an"
"agreeable flavor to many medicines, and to diminish the griping of"
purgatives. Oil of anise resembles in action other volatile oils.
USES.--The oil of anise is employed with olive oil or alcohol to kill
"fleas or lice on dogs, rubbed over the skin; and one drop of the pure"
oil may be placed on the feathers of fowl to cause destruction of lice.
"The oil of anise is sometimes prescribed to disguise the odor of drugs,"
and is ordered in cough mixtures for its expectorant properties.
"enclosed like a lake by mountains and volcanic cones, all this must"
"also appear strange and beautiful to the Trobrianders. In the villages,"
"they are entertained by their male friends, the language spoken by both"
"parties being that of Dobu, which differs completely from Kiriwinian,"
but which the Sinaketans learn in early youth. It is remarkable that
no one in Dobu speaks Kiriwinian.
"As said above, no sexual relations of any description take place"
between the visitors and the women of Dobu. As one of the informants
told me:
"""We do not sleep with women of Dobu, for Dobu is the final mountain"
"(Koyaviguna Dobu); it is a taboo of the mwasila magic."""
"But when I enquired, whether the results of breaking this taboo would"
"be baneful to their success in Kula only, the reply was that they were"
"afraid of breaking it, and that it was ordained of old (tokunabogwo"
ayguri) that no man should interfere with the women of Dobu. As a
"matter of fact, the Sinaketans are altogether afraid of the Dobuans,"
and they would take good care not to offend them in any way.
"After some three or four days' sojourn in Dobu, the Sinaketan"
fleet starts on its return journey. There is no special ceremony of
"farewell. In the early morning, they receive their talo'i (farewell"
"gifts) of food, betel-nut, objects of use and sometimes also a Kula"
valuable is enclosed amongst the the talo'i. Heavily laden as they
"are, they lighten their canoes by means of a magic called kaylupa,"
and sail away northwards once more.

[Footnote 134: The motor imagery suggested by music is in some persons
"profuse and apparently capricious, and may be regarded as an anomaly"
"comparable to a synaesthesia. Heine was an example of this, and he has"
described in _Florentine Nights_ the visions aroused by the playing of
"Paganini, and elsewhere the visions evoked in him by the music of Berlioz."
"Though I do not myself experience this phenomenon, I have found that there"
is sometimes a tendency for music to arouse ideas of motor imagery; thus
some melodies of Handel suggest a giant painting frescoes on a vast wall
space. The most elementary motor relationship of music is seen in the
tendency of many people to sway portions of their body--to 'beat time'--in
sympathy with the music. (This phenomenon has been experimentally studied
"by J. B. Miner, 'Motor, Visual, and Applied Rhythms,' Monograph Supplement"
"to the _Psychological Review_, vol. v., No. 4, June 1903). Music is"
"fundamentally an audible dance, and the most primitive music is dance"
music.]
[Footnote 135: The instinctive nature of this tendency is shown by the
fact that it persists even in sleep. Thus Weygandt relates that he once
fell asleep in the theatre during one of the last scenes of _Cavalleria
"Rusticana_, when the tenor was singing in ever higher and higher tones,"
and dreamed that in order to reach the notes the performer was climbing up
ladders and stairs on the stage.]
"money, Slyne. Where is she? Fetch her in here."""
"Slyne had no farther to go to do that than to the next room, where he"
"found Sallie at the window, gazing pensively out at the sea. But he"
delayed there for some time to make it still more clear to her that her
only hope of helping herself lay in abetting him blindly.
"When he at length returned to his own sitting-room with her, he found"
"Captain Dove staring fixedly at another arrival there, an overwhelmingly"
"up-to-date if rather imbecile-looking young man, whose general"
"gorgeousness, combined with a very vacant, fish-like eye much magnified"
"by a monocle, had evidently reduced the would-be fashionable seaman to a"
stricken silence.
"Slyne, who had at first shot a most malevolent glance at the intruder,"
was stepping forward to greet him just as Mr. Jobling put in an
appearance with a sheaf of papers in one hand.
"""How d'ye do, Lord Ingoldsby?"" said Slyne quite suavely to the young man"
"with the eye-glass. He had caught sight of Mr. Jobling in the doorway,"
"and turned to Sallie, his quick mind bent on a masterstroke."
"""May I introduce to you the Marquis of Ingoldsby,"" he remarked to her in"
"the monotone of convention; and, as she bowed slightly in response to"
"that very modern young gentleman's ingratiating wriggle and grin, Slyne,"
"one eye on Captain Dove's astonished countenance, completed the"
formality.
"""This is Lady Josceline Justice,"" said he to his smirking lordship, and"
breathed delicately into a somewhat extensive ear the further
"information, ""the late Earl of Jura's daughter, you know--and my"
"_fiancée_."""
"""We must be in La Granja in two hours if we are to save a soul within"
"its walls,"" he said, ""but--we have an hour for dinner first! Therefore"
"let us dine. God knows when we shall taste food again!"""
And with this dictum John Mortimer heartily agreed.
CHAPTER XXX
PALACE BURGLARS
The startling announcement of the Sergeant at once set the whole party
"in motion. Their suspicions of the morning were cast to the winds, as"
"the Sergeant and La Giralda in turn related their adventures. Concha,"
"having formerly vouched so strongly for the old gipsy woman, now nodded"
"triumphantly across to Rollo, who on his part listened intently. As"
Sergeant Cardono proceeded the young man leaned further and further
"forward, breathing deeply and regularly. The expression on his face was"
that of fierce and keen resolution.
"The Sergeant told all the tale as it had happened, reserving only the"
"identification of himself with the famous José Maria of Ronda, which the"
"gipsies had made on the strength of the red mark about his neck, now"
"once more concealed under his military stock. Cardono, however, made no"
"secret that he was of the blood of Egypt, and set down to this fact all"
that he had been able to accomplish. In swift well-chosen words he told
"of the fierce little girl with the dark hair and blue eyes, who declared"
"herself to be the daughter of Muñoz, sometime paramour and now reputed"
husband of the Queen-Regent--making it clear that she had indeed planned
"that day, despite the fact that Big George, bruised, ragged, and torn,"
doubled his force of pickets and took personal charge of them.
"That night, under glaring headlines, the evening papers told the story,"
"reporting one fisherman fatally hurt, one striker dead of a gunshot"
"wound, and many others injured."
CHAPTER XVIII
WILLIS MARSH SPRINGS A TRAP
"The ensuing days were strenuous ones for the partners, working as they"
"did, with a crippled force and under constant guard. Riot was in the"
"air, and violence on every side. By the police, whose apathy"
disappeared only when an opportunity occurred of arresting the men they
"were supposed to protect, they were more handicapped than helped. The"
appearance of a fisherman at any point along the water-front became a
sure signal for strife.
"Day by day the feeling on both sides grew stronger, till the non-union"
"men were cemented together in a spirit of bitterest indignation, which"
materially lessened their zeal for work. Every act of violence
"intensified their rage. They armed themselves, in defiance of orders,"
"tossed restraint to the winds, and sought the slightest opportunity of"
wreaking vengeance upon their enemies. Nor were the rioters less
"determined. Authority, after all, is but a hollow shell, which, once"
"broken, is quickly disintegrated. Fierce engagements took place,"
he who is laughing at the others.
“The other day he said to me in his macaronic Italian:
"“‘Mr. Spaniard, I have good eyesight, good hearing, a good sense of"
"smell, and... lots of sentiment.’"
"“I didn’t exactly understand what he meant me to think, and I didn’t pay"
any attention to him.
"“It seems that the Norwegian is going away soon, and as the day of his"
"departure approaches, he grows funereal.”"
_THE SADNESS OF LIFE_
"“I don’t know why I don’t go away,” Cæsar wrote to his friend another"
time. “When I go out in the evening and see the ochre-coloured houses on
"both sides and the blue sky above, a horrible sadness takes me. These"
"spring days oppress me, make me want to weep; it seems to me it would"
"be better to be dead, leaving no tomb or name or other ridiculous and"
"disagreeable thing, but disappearing into the air or the sea. It"
doesn’t seem natural; but I have never been so happy as one time when I
"was in Paris sick, alone and with a fever. I was in an hotel room and"
"my window looked into the garden of a fine house, where I could see the"
"tops of the trees; and I transformed them into a virgin forest, wherein"
marvellous adventures happened to me.
“Since then I have often thought that things are probably neither good
"nor bad, neither sad nor happy, in themselves; he who has sound, normal"
"nerves, and a brain equally sound, reflects the things around him like a"
"good mirror, and feels with comfort the impression of his conformity to"
"There was an Old Man of Cape Horn,"
Who wished he had never been born;
"So he sat in a chair till he died of despair,"
That dolorous Man of Cape Horn.
"Now, except in case of very young children, this could not possibly be"
taken seriously. The least observant normal boy or girl would recognise
the hollowness of the pessimism that prevents a man from at least an
attempt to rise from his chair.
The following I have chosen as repeated with intense appreciation and
much dramatic vigour by a little boy just five years old:
"There was an Old Man who said, “Hush!"
I perceive a young bird in this bush!”
"When they said, “Is it small?” he replied, “Not at all!"
It is four times as big as the bush!”[32]
One of the most desirable of all elements to introduce into our stories
is that which encourages kinship with animals. With very young children
"this is easy, because in those early years when the mind is not clogged"
"with knowledge, the sympathetic imagination enables them to enter into"
the feelings of animals. Andersen has an illustration of this point in
his “Ice Maiden”:
“Children who cannot talk yet can understand the language of fowls and
"ducks quite well, and cats and dogs speak to them quite as plainly as"
"Father and Mother; but that is only when the children are very small,"
and then even Grandpapa's stick will become a perfect horse to them
"that can neigh and, in their eyes, is furnished with legs and a tail."
"With some children this period ends later than with others, and of such"
"men-of-war as a petty officer. Until July, 1723, when 40 years of age,"
"Upton lived a perfectly honest life, but his wife dying, Upton found she"
had contracted various debts and that he was in danger of being arrested
"by the creditors. Leaving his four orphans, Upton hurried to Poole in"
"Dorsetshire, and was taken on as boatswain in the _John and Elizabeth_"
"(Captain Hooper), bound for Bonavista in Newfoundland. He seems to have"
"continued to sail as an honest seaman until November 14th, 1725, when"
"serving as boatswain in the _Perry_ galley, on a voyage between Barbadoes"
"and Bristol, the vessel was taken by a pirate, Cooper, in the _Night"
Rambler_. At his subsequent trial witnesses declared that Upton willingly
"joined the pirates, signed their articles, and was afterwards one of their"
most active and cruel men.
"Upton kept a journal, which was his only witness for his defence, in which"
he described how he was forced to sign the pirates' articles under threats
"of instant death. If his journal is to be believed, Upton escaped from the"
"pirates at the first opportunity, landing on the Mosquito coast. After"
"being arrested by the Spaniards as a spy, he was sent from one prison to"
"another in Central America, at last being put on board a galleon at Porto"
"Bello, to be sent to Spain. Escaping, he got aboard a New York sloop and"
"arrived at Jamaica in December, 1726. While at Port Royal he was pressed"
"on board H.M.S. _Nottingham_, serving in her for more than two years as"
"quartermaster, until one day he was accused of having been a pirate. Under"
"this charge he was brought a prisoner to England in 1729, tried in London,"
"and hanged, protesting his innocence to the last."

"Pteropods, a suborder of the gastropods, appeared in this age."
Their papery shells of carbonate of lime are found in great
numbers from this time on.
"Cephalopods, the most highly organized of the mollusks, started"
"into existence, so far as the record shows, toward, the end of the"
"Cambrian, with the long extinct ORTHOCERAS (STRAIGHTHORN) and the"
"allied genera of its family. The Orthoceras had a long, straight,"
"and tapering shell, divided by cross partitions into chambers. The"
"animal lived in the ""body chamber"" at the larger end, and walled"
off the other chambers from it in succession during the growth of
"the shell. A central tube, the SIPHUNCLE, passed through from the"
body chamber to the closed tip of the cone.
"The seashells, both brachiopods and mollusks, are in some respects"
the most important to the geologist of all fossils. They have been
"so numerous, so widely distributed, and so well preserved because"
"of their durable shells and their station in growing sediments,"
that better than any other group of organisms they can be used to
correlate the strata of different regions and to mark by their
slow changes the advance of geological time.
CLIMATE. The life of Cambrian times in different countries
"contains no suggestion of any marked climatic zones, and as in"
later periods a warm climate probably reached to the polar
regions.

were demanded and gradually the psalter appeared with tunes. Early tune
"versions put the melody invariably in the tenor. The latest edition,"
"printed in 1929, by the Oxford Press, contains the best Psalm tunes"
"which had gradually come into use, many of them arranged with"
“Faux-bourdon” (wherein the congregation sings one or more verses to the
"melody while the choir supplies the harmony), and “Descant” (a second"
melody over that of the tune).
"f. _The New Version_, Tate and Brady, London, 1696. This version"
"gradually supplanted the _Old Version_ of Sternhold and Hopkins, and"
held its place in the worship of the church for 150 years. It was
"adopted, in 1789, by the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United"
States and bound with the prayer book of that Communion.
The above versions are only a few of the large number of psalters that
"were published by the Calvinistic churches on the Continent, in Great"
"Britain, and in America. The metrical psalms were designed for the"
singing church. They were intended to restore song to the people in
"their worship, serving in this respect a similar purpose to the chorales"
in Germany.
"Some of the psalm books were published without music, some with the"
"melody only, and others in four-part harmony. The statement is"
frequently made that Calvinistic Protestantism approved only unison
"singing. The appearance of numerous books, complete with four voice"
"parts, points to the contrary. It is true that Calvin at first"
"encouraged unison singing only, regarding harmony more in the nature of"
amusement than the worship of God; but upon observing the effectiveness
"of singing in Germany, he soon changed his views and became more liberal"
in this respect.
"la police des moeurs."""
Mrs. Warren at least died with the reputation of one who promptly
"paid her bills; and the whole _assistance_, as it walked slowly back"
"to Brussels, recalled many a deed of kindness and jovial charity on"
the part of the dead Englishwoman.

"Vivie, on sizing up her affairs, got Monsieur Walcker, the Baptist"
"pasteur, to convey a letter to the American Consulate General."
"Walcker was used to such missions as these, of which the German"
"Government was more or less cognizant. The Germans, among their many"
"contradictory features, had a great respect for religion, a great"
tolerance as to its forms. They not only appreciated the difference
"between Jews and Christians, Catholics and Lutherans, but between"
the Church of England and the various Free Churches of Britain and
America. The many people whom they sentenced to death must all have
their appropriate religious consolation before facing the firing
"party. Catholics, Lutherans and Calvinists were all provided for;"
there was a Church of England chaplain for the avowed Anglicans; but
what was to be done for the Free Churches and Nonconformist sects of
the Anglo-Saxons? They were not represented by any captive pastor;
"so in default this much respected Monsieur Walcker, the Belgian"
"Baptist, was called in to minister to the Nonconformist mind in its"
last agony. He therefore held a quasi-official position and was
often entrusted with missions which would have been dealt with
punitorily on the part of any one else. Consequently he was able to
deliver Vivie's communication to the American Consul-General with
some probability of its being sent on. It contained no further
appeal to American intervention than this: that the Consul-General
would try to convey to England the news of her mother's death to
(_f_) Vital statements.
PLAN
The indexer should decide definitely in his mind just what his
"procedure is to be before actually beginning work. At first, it is well"
"to make the index too full rather than the reverse, as it is easier to"
"cut out than to fill in. Most important of all, he must be sure that"
the matter to be indexed is clearly understood before he attempts to
transcribe the idea. The character of the book to be indexed must be
"carefully considered, taking into account the class of people who will"
"probably consult it, and the lines on which they will probably seek"
information.
Judgment is required in deciding whether it is wise to choose the
exact words of the author or to condense the idea into other words.
"In technical books, the exact wording is sometimes essential, but"
otherwise it is more important to express the _idea_ than the exact
terms in which it is expressed.
Always prefer simple words and expressions to those which are unusual
and cumbersome.
Omit every unessential word.
"When the book being indexed is one written upon a specific subject,"
this main subject should not be indexed unless necessary to indicate
"some reference for which a searcher would look. Ordinarily, the"
Contents covers this point rather than the Index.
Bear in mind particularly the two extremes: the importance of
"of the purpose you have in view concerning him, he would not feel so"
"much flattered as you seem to imagine, but rather insulted! Excuse my"
"frankness,--you have spoken plainly,--I must speak plainly too."
Provision dealers and sensational story writers may find that it serves
"their purpose to be interviewed, if only as a means of gaining extra"
"advertisement, but a truly great and conscientious author like Theos"
"Alwyn is quite above all that sort of thing."""
The lady raised her pale eyebrows with an expression of interrogative
scorn.
"""ABOVE all that sort of thing!"" she echoed incredulously--""Dear me! How"
very extraordinary! I have always found all our celebrities so
exceedingly pleased to be given a little additional notoriety! ... and
"I should have thought a POET,"" this with much depreciative"
"emphasis--""would have been particularly glad of the chance! Because, of"
"course you know that unless a very astonishing success is made, as in"
"the case of Mr. Alwyn's 'Nourhalma,' people really take such slight"
"interest in writers of verse, that it is hardly ever worth while"
"interviewing them!"""
"""Precisely!"" agreed Villiers ironically,--""The private history of a"
"prize-fighter would naturally be much more thrilling!"" He paused,--his"
"temper was fast rising, but, quickly reflecting that, after all, the"
indignation he felt was not so much against his visitor as against the
"system she represented, he resumed quietly, ""May I ask you, madam,"
"whether you have ever 'interviewed' Her Majesty the Queen?"""
Her glance swept slightingly over him.
"""Certainly not! Such a thing would be impossible!"""
who are neither priests nor in orders.
"The Abbé spoke poor English, therefore the conversation was carried on in"
"French, much to the annoyance of some of our guests, who pretended to a"
greater knowledge of that language than they possessed.
"Soon after my presentation to the Abbé, the king arrived, and we all went"
"out to the supper table, where the Abbé's chair was on the king's right,"
with De Grammont on his Majesty's left. After the king had been seated a
"moment, he rose and asked us to be seated; so we took our places, all"
save the king dropping our hats beside us on the floor because of his
Majesty's presence.
"I sat next to De Grammont, almost opposite the Abbé, and had a good"
opportunity to observe the French emissary. The king's French was
"excellent, and the dinner conversation was carried on largely between him"
"and the Abbé. All subjects were discussed, but the Abbé adroitly avoided"
Dunkirk and seemed to prefer talking on religious and philosophical
"topics, in which he took the liberty to disagree with the king in many"
"respects, politely though positively."
"I listened attentively, hoping that some tone of the Abbé's voice, a pose"
"or a gesture, might reveal George Hamilton, if it were he, in the most"
"excellent disguise I had ever seen. But nothing of the sort occurred, and"
"before the dinner was over, I was still more convinced that whoever the"
"Abbé du Boise might be, he was not Hamilton."
"After dinner came the heavy wines, of which the Abbé did not partake, and"
"of which De Grammont and I drank sparingly. All the others, including the"
"king, were gloriously drunk long before the night was over."
"While smoking our pipes, the king, who was eager to get his hands"
Northern companies are finding some profit in exploiting such natural
resources of Panama as are available in their wild state. Of these the
"most promising is rubber, the tree being found in practically every part"
"of the country. One concern, the Boston-Panama Company, has an estate"
"approximating 400 square miles on which are about 100,000 wild rubber"
"trees, and which is being further developed by the planting of bananas,"
"pineapples, cocoanuts and other tropical fruits."
[Illustration: WAITING FOR THE BOAT]
"Coffee, sugar and cacao are raised on the Isthmus, but of the two former"
not enough to supply the local demand. The development of the cacao
"industry to large proportions seems probable, as several foreign"
corporations are experimenting on a considerable scale. Cocoanuts are
easily grown along both coasts of the Isthmus. A new grove takes about
"five years to come into bearing, costing an average of about three"
dollars a tree. Once established the trees bring in a revenue of about
"one dollar each at present prices and, as the demand for Panama"
"cocoanuts is steady, the industry seems to offer attractive"
"possibilities. The groves must be near the coast, as the cocoanut tree"
needs salt air to reach its best estate. Given the right atmospheric
conditions they will thrive where no other plant will take root. Growing
"at the edge of the sea, water transportation is easy."

"This industry is in its infancy in Panama, but promises to be a"
considerable resource]
[Illustration: STARTED FOR MARKET]
MARGINS
A feature not to be overlooked in the appearance of a well-printed
book is that of the margins. The perfect type-page is supposed to be
proportioned in such a way that its diagonal is twice its width. With
"this page as a basis, the location of the type upon the paper leaf is"
"to be studied carefully. In general, the two pages, right and left,"
"should be considered as a unit, and the top margin and the inside"
"margin of each page should be approximately the same. Doing this, the"
total blank between the two pages is supposed approximately to equal
the outside and the bottom margins.
"The proportion of margin is, to a certain extent, dependent upon the"
"size of the book, the margins becoming greater as the volume increases"
from the thirty-two mo size up to the folio. A student of typography
"has ingeniously estimated that, taking the height of the paper leaf"
"as 100 units, the height of the type page of the ordinary trade book"
"should be from 72% to 75%; that of a library edition, from 66% to 71%;"
"that of a de luxe volume, from 60% to 65%."
MAKING THE INDEX
"EVERY book of a permanent nature, or intended as a work of reference,"
"requires an index. The length of the Index, or its minuteness, depends"
"upon the nature of the subject treated, and the importance of making it"
easily available to the reader. The Index belongs to the same family
"as the Table of Contents, and the Topical Analyses often placed at the"
"sailed away with his prize from the harbour. This prize, amongst the"
"merchandise, contained 40,000 moidors and a cross of diamonds designed for"
the King of Portugal.
"He then took a Dutch ship, and two days later an English one, and sailed"
"back to Brazil, refitting and cleaning at the Island of Ferdinando."
"In a work such as this is, it is impossible to recount all, or even a few,"
"of the daring adventures, or the piratical ups and downs of one pirate."
Roberts sailed to the West Indies devastating the commerce of Jamaica and
"Barbadoes. When things grew too hot there, he went north to Newfoundland,"
and played the very devil with the English and French fishing fleets and
settlements.
"His first ship he called the _Fortune_, his next, a bigger ship, the"
"_Royal Fortune_, another the _Good Fortune_."
"On two occasions Roberts had been very roughly handled, once by a ship"
"from Barbadoes and once by the inhabitants of Martinica, so when he"
"designed his new flag, he portrayed on it a huge figure of himself"
"standing sword in hand upon two skulls, and under these were the letters"
"A.B.H. and A.M.H., signifying a Barbadian's and a Martinican's head."
"In April, 1721, Roberts was back again on the Guinea Coast, burning and"
plundering. Amongst the prisoners he took out of one of his prizes was a
clergyman. The captain dearly wished to have a chaplain on board his ship
"to administer to the spiritual welfare of his crew, and tried all he could"
"to persuade the parson to sign on, promising him that his only duties"
should be to say prayers and make punch. But the prelate begged to be
"excused, and was at length allowed to go with all his belongings, except"
three prayer-books and a corkscrew--articles which were sorely needed
aboard the _Royal Fortune_.

"officers and crew of His Majesty's ship to the prize bounty, and stating"
the amount thereof.
(2) The decree shall be subject to appeal as other decrees of the court.
Part V.--SPECIAL CASES OF JURISDICTION.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of capture in land expedition. [27 & 28
"Vict. c. 25, s. 34.]]"
"34. Where, in an expedition of any of His Majesty's naval or naval and"
military forces against a fortress or possession on land goods belonging
"to the state of the enemy, or to a public trading company of the enemy"
"exercising powers of government, are taken in the fortress or"
"possession, or a ship is taken in waters defended by or belonging to the"
"fortress or possession, a prize court shall have jurisdiction as to the"
"goods or ships so taken, and any goods taken on board the ship, as in"
case of prize.
[Sidenote: Jurisdiction in case of prize taken in expedition with ally.
"[27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 35.]]"
35. Where any ship or goods is or are taken by any of His Majesty's
naval or naval and military forces while acting in conjunction with any
"forces of any of His Majesty's allies, a prize court shall have"
"jurisdiction as to the same as in case of prize, and shall have power,"
"after condemnation, to apportion the due share of the proceeds to His"
"Majesty's ally, the proportionate amount and the disposition of which"
share shall be such as may from time to time be agreed between His
"Queen-Regent,"" whispered the portress, Rebeca, pointing upwards; ""but"
"promise me to commit no murder or do any hurt to the little maid."""
"""Be quiet, woman,"" muttered Rollo, more roughly than was his wont; ""we"
"are come to save both of them from worse than death. Sergeant Cardono,"
"bring the ladder!"""
"The Sergeant disappeared, and it was not many seconds before he was back"
again adjusting its hooks to the side of an iron balcony in front of one
of the lighted rooms. Almost before he had finished Rollo would have
"mounted, impetuously as was his custom, but the Sergeant held him back"
by the arm.
"""I crave your forgiveness,"" he whispered, ""but if you will pardon me"
"saying so, I have much more experience in such matters than you. Permit"
me in this single case to precede you! We know not what or whom we may
"meet with above!"""
"Nevertheless, though the Sergeant mounted first, Rollo followed so"
closely that his hands upon the rounds of the ladder were more than once
in danger of being trodden upon by the Sergeant's half-boots.
Presently they stood together on the iron balcony and peered within. A
tall dark man leaned against an elaborately carved mantelpiece
indolently stroking his glossy black whiskers. A lady arrayed in a
"dressing-gown of pink silk reaching to her feet was seated on a chair,"
"and submitting restlessly enough to the hands of her maid, who was"
"arranging her hair for the night, in the intervals of a violent but"
somewhat one-sided quarrel which was proceeding between the pair.
Every few moments the lady would start from her seat and with her eyes
flashing fire she would advance towards the indolent dandy by the

"(née Walcker), distressed and unusually moved at the sad"
"circumstances of Mrs. Warren's death, had called in her uncle the"
Baptist pastor (who also in some unexplained way seemed to hold a
brief for the Salvation Army). He prayed silently by the death-bed
"which, under the circumstances, was more tactful than open"
intercession. He helped greatly over all the formalities of the
"funeral, and he took upon himself the arrangement of the ceremony,"
"so that everything was done decorously, and certainly to the"
"satisfaction of the Belgians, who attended. Such people would be"
"large-minded in religion--you might be Protestant, if you were not"
"Catholic, or you might be Jewish; but a funeral without some outward"
sign of faith and hope would have puzzled and distressed them.
"To Vivie's great surprise, there was a considerable attendance at"
the ceremony. She had expected no more than the company of Minna--an
"unprofessing but real Christian, if ever there were one, and the"
equally Christian if equally hedonist Mme. Trouessart. But there
"came in addition quite a number of shopkeepers from the Rue Royale,"
"the Rues de Schaerbeek, du Marais, de Lione, and de l'Association,"
"with whom Mrs. Warren had dealt in years gone by. ""C'etait une dame"
"_très_ convenable,"" said one purveyor, and the others agreed. ""Elle"
"me paya écus sonnants,"" said another, ""et toujours sans"
"marchander."" There was even present a more distinguished"
acquaintance of the past: a long-retired Commissaire de Police of
the Quartier in which Mrs. Warren's hotel was situated.
"He appeared in the tightly-buttoned frock-coat of civil life, with a"
"minute disc of some civic decoration in his button hole, and an"
incredibly tall chimney-pot hat. He came to render his _respectueux
hommages_ to the maîtresse-femme who had conducted her business
"within the four corners of the law, ""sans avoir maille à partir avec"
"""I suppose I had better introduce myself to you, Mr. Alwyn""--she said"
"with a condescending and confident air--""Though really we know each"
other so well by reputation that there seems scarcely any necessity for
"it! Of course you have heard of 'Tiger-Lily!'"""
"Villiers gazed at her helplessly,--he had never felt so uncomfortable"
"in all his life. Here was a strange woman, who had actually taken"
"bodily possession of his apartment as though it were her own,--who had"
"settled herself down in his particular pet Louis Quatorze chair,--who"
stared at him with the scrutinizing complacency of a professional
"physiognomist,--and who seemed to think no explanation of her"
"extraordinary conduct was necessary, inasmuch as ""of course"" he,"
"Villiers, had heard of ""TIGER-LILY!"" It was very singular! ... almost"
like madness! ... Perhaps she WAS mad! How could he tell? She had a
"remarkably high, knobby brow,--a brow with an unpleasantly bald"
"appearance, owing to the uncompromising way in which her hair was"
brushed well off it--he had seen such brows before in certain
"""spiritualists"" who believed, or pretended to believe, in the suddenly"
"willed dematerialization of matter, and THEY were mad, he knew, or else"
very foolishly feigning madness!
"Endeavoring to compose his bewildered mind, he fixed glass in eye, and"
"regarded her through it with an inquiring solemnity,--he would have"
"spoken, but before he could utter a word, she went on rapidly:"
"""You are not in the least like the person I imagined you to be! ..."
"However, that doesn't matter. Literary celebrities are always so"
"different to what we expect!"""
"""Pardon me, madam,""--began Villiers politely.. ""You are making a slight"
"error,--my servant probably did not explain. I am not Mr. Alwyn, . . my"
"""run"" across the mountains or beached on the desolate sands of"
Catalunia.
"""I am no inlander,"" he said, ""I am of the sea-coast of Tarragona. I have"
never been south of Tortosa in my life; but there does not live a man
who has conducted more good cigars and brandy to their destination than
"old Pépe of the Eleven Wounds!"""
The sergeant with grave courtesy reached him a well-rolled cigarette.
"""I have heard of your fame, brother,"" he said; ""even at Ronda and on the"
Madrid-Seville road your deeds are not unknown. But what of this venture
"to-night? Have you enough men, think you, to overpower the town watchmen"
"and the palace-guards?"""
The old gipsy tossed his bony hands into the air with a gesture of
incomparable contempt.
"""The palace guards are fled back to Madrid,"" he cried, ""and as to the"
"town watch they are either drunk or in their dotage!"""
Meantime the main body of the gipsies waited patiently in the
"background, and every few minutes their numbers were augmented by the"
arrival of others over the various passes of the mountains. These took
"their places without salutation, like men expected, and fell promptly to"
"listening to the conversation of the two great men, who sat smoking"
their cigarettes each on his own stone in the wide wild corrie among the
rocks of the Guadarrama which had been chosen as an appropriate
rendezvous.
"Singularly enough, after the sergeant had shown the scarlet mark of the"
"strangling ring about his neck, no one of all that company doubted for a"
"without undue hostility to strangers, they discourage their incursions."

A GIRL OF THE CHOCO TRIBE]
“Their means of persuasion are adjusted to the importance of the
intruder. They do not hesitate to shoot at any negro of the nearby
settlements poaching on their cocoanuts or other products; the trader or
any occasional visitor is very seldom allowed to stay ashore at night;
the adventurers who try to go prospecting into Indian territory are
invariably caught and shipped back to the next Panamanian port”.
Among the men of the San Blas tribe the land held by their people is
"regarded as a sacred trust, bequeathed to them by their ancestors and to"
be handed down by them to the remotest posterity. During the early days
of the Canal project it was desired to dig sand from a beach in the San
Blas country. A small United States man-of-war was sent thither to
"broach the subject to the Indians, and the Captain held parley with the"
chief. After hearing the plea and all the arguments and promises with
which it was strengthened the old Indian courteously refused the
privilege:
"“He who made this land”, said he, “made it for Cuna-Cuna who live no"
"longer, for those who are here today and also for the ones to come. So"
it is not ours only and we could not sell it”.
"To this decision the tribe adhered, and the wishes of the aborigines"
have been respected. It has been the policy of the United States to
avoid any possibility of giving offense to the native population of the
"him--namely, that the Regent and her daughter were by no means averse to"
"Holy Church, nor yet eager to keep the true King out of his own. But,"
"they were in the power of unscrupulous men--Mendizábal, Linares, and"
"others, who for their own ends published edicts and compelled the ladies"
"to sign them. If they were captured and sequestered for their own good,"
the ministry would break down and Don Carlos would reign undisturbed.
Rollo thought the exposition a marvel of clearness and point. It was
"somewhat disappointing, therefore, when he had finished to hear from"
"Cabrera the unmoved declaration: ""A Cristino is a Cristino whether in"
the palace of Madrid or on the mountains of Morella. And the quickest
"way is the best way with such an one, wherever met with!"""
"""But you do not mean to say that you would shoot the girl-Queen or the"
"mother-Regent if they fell into your hands?"" cried Rollo, aghast at the"
horror.
The deep underlying anger leaped up fiery red into the eyes of the
_guerrilla_ chief.
"""Aye, that would I,"" he cried, ""as quickly as they slew my own old"
"mother in the barrack yard of Tortosa!"""
"And thinking of that tragedy and the guilt of Nogueras, Rollo felt there"
"was something to be said for the indomitable, implacable little"
butcher-general of Don Carlos.
"Cabrera was silent for a while after making this speech, and then"
abruptly demanded of Rollo how many men he would require for his
undertaking.
"""I am bidden to place my entire command at your service,"" he said with"
"By a window at the end of the passage, one could see, far away, the"
"Alban Hills, looking like a blue mountain-range, half hidden in white"
"haze, and nearby one could see the trees in the Protestant cemetery and"
the pyramid of Caïus Cestius close to them.
"Cæsar felt a sort of deep repugnance for the people shut up here,"
remote from life and protected from it by a lot of things.
“The man who is playing the harmonium in this church with its opaque
"light, is a coward,” he said to himself. “One must live and struggle in"
"the open air, among men, in the midst of their passions and hatreds,"
even though one’s miserable nerves quiver and tremble.”
"After showing them the monastery, the abbot Hildebrand took them to his"
"study, where he worked at revising ancient translations of the Bible. He"
had photographic copies of all the Latin texts and he was collating them
with the original.
"They talked of the progress of the Church, and the abbot commented with"
"some contempt on the worldly success of the Jesuit churches, with their"
saints who serve as well to get husbands and rich wives as to bring
winning numbers in the lottery.
"Before going out, they went to a window, at the other end of the"
corridor from where they had looked out before. Below them they could
"see the Tiber as far as the Ripa harbour; opposite, the heights of the"
"Janiculum, and further, Saint Peter’s."
"When they went out, Kennedy said to Cæsar:"
"“What devilish effect has the abbey produced in you, that you are so"
much gayer than when we went in?”
within the posterior axillary line. The whole right side of the
"chest was dull, with signs of the presence of fluid, the heart"
being displaced to the left. There was considerable distress;
"the respirations averaged 40, the pulse 100, and the"
temperature reached 101.5° the first evening after arrival.
On the nineteenth day the thorax was aspirated (Mr. Hanwell)
"and 50 ounces of dirty red-coloured fluid, half clot, half"
"serum, were evacuated. Considerable relief was afforded; the"
respirations became slightly less frequent; the heart returned
"to a normal position, and distant tubular respiration was"
audible. The temperature dropped to normal the third day after
"evacuation of the fluid, but on the sixth day it again"
"commenced to rise, and meanwhile fluid again began to collect."
On the twenty-sixth day a second aspiration resulted in the
evacuation of 35 ounces of bloody fluid in which flakes of
lymph were found. Three days later the temperature became
"normal. The respirations fell to 22, and the patient made an"
uninterrupted recovery.

"About two miles northeast of the Three Fountains, and the same distance"
"from the city, on the Appian Way, stands the Church of St. Sebastian."
"Over an altar on the right, as you enter, the attendant priest, drawing"
"aside a curtain, shows you a slab of dark red stone with two enormous"
"footprints on it. These, we are told, were made by the feet of Christ"
"during an interview with Peter which took place near here, on the site"
of the small Church of Domine Quo Vadis. The story is as follows: After
"the burning of Rome, Nero charged the Christians with having fired"
"the city. Straightway the first persecution broke forth, and many of"
the Christians were put to death with dreadful torture. The survivors
"besought Peter not to expose his life. As he fled along the Appian Way,"
Christ appeared to him travelling towards the city. The fleeing apostle
"exclaimed in amazement, ""_Domine, quo vadis?_"" (Lord, whither goest"
"thou?), to which, with a look of mild sadness, the Saviour replied,"
"""_Venio iterum crucifigi_"" (I come to be crucified a second time), then"
"vanished, whereupon the apostle, ashamed of his weakness, returned to"
"Rome, and shortly afterwards was crucified there himself."
[Sidenote: The Chains of St. Peter.]
Another relic of great interest connected with the same apostle is
"shown in the Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, and indeed gives"
the church its name. The church is not without interest for other
"reasons. For instance, it possesses portions of the crosses of St."
"Peter and St. Andrew, and we are told that the high altar covers the"
remains of the seven Maccabean brothers. But the basilica is specially
famous for the possession of the greatest masterpiece of sculpture
"since the time of the Greeks--the majestic ""Moses"" of Michelangelo,"
which draws thousands of sightseers who might otherwise never set foot
"after the summer of 1915, she lived very much alone, except that she"
had the Adams children from Marylebone to spend the day with her
occasionally.
"Poor Mrs. Adams, though a valiant worker, was very downcast and"
unhappy. She confided to Mrs. Rossiter that although she dearly
"loved her Bert--""and a better husband I defy you to find""--he never"
"seemed all hers. ""Always so wrapped up in that Miss Warren or 'er"
"cousin the barrister."" And no sooner had war broken out than off he"
"was to France, as a kind of missionary, she believed--the Young"
"Men's Christian Something or other; ""though before the War he didn't"
"seem particular stuck on religion, and it was all she could do to"
get him sometimes to church on a Sunday morning. Oh yes: she got 'er
money all right; and she couldn't say too much of Mr. and Mrs.
"Rossiter's kindness. There was Bert, not doin' a stroke of work for"
"the Professor, and yet his pay going on all the same. Indeed she was"
"putting money by, because Bert was kep' out there, and all found."""
However his two pretty children were some consolation to Mrs.
"Rossiter, whom they considered as a very grand lady and one that was"
lavishly kind.
Mrs. Rossiter tried sometimes in 1915 having working parties in her
house or in the studio; and if she could attract workers gave them
such elaborate lunches and plethoric teas that very little work was
"done, especially as she herself loved a long, aimless gossip about"
the Royal Family or whether Lord Kitchener had ever _really_ been in
"love. Or she tried, since she was a poor worker herself--her only"
jersey and muffler were really finished by her maid--reading aloud
"to the knitters or stitchers, preferably from the works of Miss"
Charlotte Yonge or some similar novelist of a later date. But that
was found to be too disturbing to their sense of the ludicrous. For
dead friends to receive the blessing of the archbishop after the battle
of Roncevalles[35]; and of Napoleon sending the sailor back to England.
There is a moment in the story of Gunnar when he pauses in the midst of
"the slaughter of his enemies, and says, “I wonder if I am less brave"
"than others, because I kill men less willingly than they.”"
And in the “Njal's Burning” from Andrew Lang's “Book of Romance” we
"have the words of the boy Thord when his grandmother, Bergthora, urges"
him to go out of the burning house.
"“You promised me when I was little, grandmother, that I never should go"
from you till I wished it of myself. And I would rather die with you
than live after you.”
Here the moral courage is so splendidly shown; none of these heroes
"feared to die in battle or in open single fight, but to face a death by"
fire for higher considerations is a point of view worth presenting to
the child.
In spite of all the dramatic excitement roused by the conduct of our
"soldiers and sailors,[36] should we not try to offer also in our"
stories the romance and excitement of saving as well as _taking_ life?
I would have quite a collection dealing with the thrilling adventures
"of the Life-Boat and the Fire Brigade, of which I hope to present"
examples in the final Story List.
"Finally, we ought to include a certain number of stories dealing with"
"Death, especially with children who are of an age to realise that it"
"must come to all, and that this is not a calamity but a perfectly"
natural and simple thing. At present the child in the street invariably
connects death with sordid accidents. I think they should have stories
"the Field hospital three days, during which time he exhibited"
"no serious abdominal symptoms, but during the journey to Orange"
River (53-1/2 miles) he was sick. He remained at Orange River
"two days, and while there an enema was administered, producing"
a normal motion. The abdomen was slightly distended; it moved
"fairly, there was slight rigidity, but little tenderness."
"Temperature 100.8°, pulse 120. No appearance of fæces in wound."
When seen on the sixth day the condition was as
follows:--Patient cheerful and not in great pain. Temperature
"99.2°; pulse 120; respirations 48, very shallow. Abdomen soft,"
"moving freely, no distension or general tenderness. Fluid fæces"
escaping in abundance from the wound in loin. Redness of skin
"and swelling below level of wound, and cellular emphysema"
above. Fæcal-smelling fluid was also escaping from the thoracic
wound.
"The wound was enlarged, but the patient rapidly sank, and died"
of septicæmia on the seventh day.
(183*) An exactly similar case came under observation from the
"battle of Modder River, except that the opening in the loin was"
"somewhat larger, and earlier and freer escape of fæces took"
place from it. In this also fæcal matter passed freely into the
"left pleural cavity, and fæcal matter was expectorated, while"
there was an almost complete absence of abdominal symptoms.
Death occurred on the fourth day.
"No _post-mortem_ examination was made in either case, but I"
believe in both the extra-peritoneal aspect of the colon was
implicated and that the septicæmia was in great part due to
"absorption from the pleural rather than the peritoneal cavity,"
"persisted until the fourth day, when the patient was brought"
"down to Orange River, and the signs were as follows."
"Considerable pain in left half of abdomen, pulse 110, fair"
"strength, temperature 101°. Some general distension of abdomen"
with complete disappearance of hepatic dulness. Some movement
"of right half of abdomen, left half immobile, dulness extending"
from the flank as far forwards as linea semilunaris. An
"incision was made in left linea semilunaris, and Oj blood"
evacuated from the left loin. There was no lymph on the
intestines nor sign of inflammation. No perforation was
"discovered in either stomach or intestine, but on two coils of"
"jejunum there were deep slits 3/4 inch long, extending through"
"both peritoneal and muscular coats. Beyond these wounds, on"
"other coils oval patches of ecchymosis, due to direct bruising,"
were present. The peritoneal cavity was sponged free of all
blood and irrigated with boiled water; no bleeding point was
"discovered, and the abdomen was closed."
The next morning the patient was comfortable; temperature
"100.2°, pulse 100. Tongue clean and moist; he vomited once"
during the night.
"Some bloody discharge had collected in the dressing, and at the"
"lower angle of wound there was a local swelling, apparently in"
the abdominal wall. The flank was resonant.
"During the afternoon the patient became faint, and when seen at"
"6 P.M. was in a state of collapse, in which he shortly died."
Death was apparently due to renewal of the previous hæmorrhage.
No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"""If your Lordship means to say that I wish to withdraw dishonorably from"
"my engagement with your sister, I crave the privilege of telling you that"
"you lie!"""
"I never was more calm in my life, and my words brought a cold smile to"
Hamilton's lips.
"""My friend De Grammont will have the honor of waiting on you to-morrow"

"""I shall be delighted to see his Grace,"" I answered. ""Good night, my"
"lord!"""
Here was a solution of my problem in so far as it concerned my engagement
"with Mary Hamilton, for if I killed her brother, she would not marry"
"me, and if he killed me, I could not marry her. The fact that a gleam"
of joy came to me because of my unexpected release caused me to feel
"that I was a coward not to have broken the engagement in an honorable,"
straightforward manner rather than to have seized this opportunity to
force a duel upon her brother. It is true I had not sought the duel
deliberately and had not thought it possible one second before uttering
the word that made it necessary. Still it was my act that brought it
"about, and I felt that I had taken an unmanly course."
After leaving Count Anthony I walked across the room to where Mary
was standing at the outer edge of a circle of ladies and gentlemen who
"surrounded De Grammont, listening to a narrative in broken English, of"
"his adventures, fancied or real, I know not which, but interesting,"
and all of a questionable character.
"When I spoke to Mary, she turned and gave me her hand. I had not"
expected the least display of emotion on her part; therefore I was not

Prepared for us since Adam's fall.
I think there is no doubt that we have made considerable progress in
this matter. Not only do we refrain from telling these highly moral
"(_sic_) stories but we have reached the point of parodying them,"
"in sign of ridicule, as, for instance, in such writing as Belloc's"
"“Cautionary Tales.” These would be a trifle too grim for a timid child,"
but excellent fun for adults.
It should be our study to-day to prove to children that the immediate
"importance to them is not to think of dying and going to Heaven, but"
"of living and--shall we say?--going to College, which is a far better"
preparation for a life to come than the morbid dwelling upon the
possibility of an early death.
"In an article signed “Muriel Harris,” I think, from a copy of the"
"_Tribune_, appeared a delightful article on Sunday Books, from which I"
quote the following:
"“All very good little children died young in the story-books, so that"
unusual goodness must have been the source of considerable anxiety to
affectionate parents. I came across a little old book the other day
called ‘Examples for Youth.’ On the yellow fly-leaf was written in
"childish, carefully sloping hand: ‘Presented to Mary Palmer Junior, by"
"her sister, to be read on Sundays,’ and was dated 1828. The accounts"
"are taken from a work on _Piety Promoted_, and all of them begin with"
unusual piety in early youth and end with the death-bed of the little
"paragon, and his or her dying words.”"

"combination you lose what is essential to each, namely, the fantastic"

"ridden rapidly by, a couple of pretty girls had looked out curiously at"
the tossing Carlist _boinas_.
Rollo and El Sarria were carrying their scanty provend to a house where
"a decent-looking woman had agreed to cook it for them, when their gloomy"
reveries were interrupted by a sudden apparition which burst upon them
as they stood on the crest of a deep hollow.
"The limestone hills had been rent asunder at the place, and from the"
bare faces of the rocks the neighbouring farmers and villagers had
quarried and carried away such of the overhanging blocks as could easily
be trimmed to suit their purposes.
"Part of what remained had been shaped into a _hornito_, or stone oven,"
"under which a fire had been kindled, and a strange figure moved about,"
stirring the glowing charcoal with a long bar of iron. On a smaller
"hearth nearer at hand a second fire blazed, and the smell of fragrant"
cookery rose to the expectant and envious nostrils of the four.
"It was Sergeant Cardono, who moved about whistling softly, now attending"
"to the steaming _olla_, now watching the rising bread in the _hornito_."
"Perceiving Rollo, he saluted gravely and remarked, ""Dinner will be"
"served in half an hour."" The others, as before, he simply ignored. But"
in deference to his new commander he stopped whistling and moved about
with his lean shoulders squared as if on parade.
"When the bread and the skinny chicken were placed in his hands, he"
glanced at them with somewhat of superciliousness.
"""The bread will serve for crumbs,"" he said, and immediately began to"
For the Burman's life and belief is one great whole.
"I thought before I began to write, and I have become more and more"
"certain of it as I have taken up subject after subject, that to all the"
great differences of thought between them and us there is one key. And
"this key is that they believe the world is governed by eternal laws,"
"that have never changed, that will never change, that are founded on"
"absolute righteousness; while we believe in a personal God, altering"
"laws, and changing moralities according to His will."
"If I were to rewrite this book, I should do so from this standpoint of"
"eternal laws, making the book an illustration of the proposition."
"Perhaps it is better as it is, in that I have discovered the key at the"
end of my work instead of at the beginning. I did not write the book to
"prove the proposition, but in writing the book this truth has become"
apparent to me.
"The more I have written, the clearer has this teaching become to me,"
"until now I wonder that I did not understand long ago--nay, that it has"
not always been apparent to all men.
Surely it is the beginning of all wisdom.

and distended. No lymph. Two wounds were found in the ileum on
"the opposite sides of one coil; the openings were circular,"
with the mucous membrane everted. No escape of fæcal matter was
"visible until the intestine was delivered, when intestinal"
contents spurted freely across the room. The openings were
sutured with five Lembert's stitches. The bowel was punctured
"in two places to relieve distension, and then returned into the"
"belly, after washing with boiled water."
Four pints of saline solution were infused into the median
"basilic vein, and 1/30 grain strychnine sulph. was injected"

Verily the whole situation was remarkably complex.
The briefest look around convinced Rollo that it would be impossible for
so small a party to hold the long range of iron palisades which
"surrounded the palace. These were complete, indeed, but their extent was"
far too great to afford any hope of keeping out the gipsies without
"finding themselves taken in the rear. They must hold La Granja itself,"
"that was clear. There remained, therefore, only the problem of finding"
entrance.
Between the porter's lodge and the great gates near the _Colegiata_ they
discovered a ladder left somewhat carelessly against a wall where
"whitewashing had been going on during the day, some ardent royal"
"tradesman having ventured back, preferring the chance of the plague to"
the abandonment of his contract.
"This they at once appropriated, and Rollo and the Sergeant, being the"
"two most agile of the company, prepared to mount."
"If the time had been less critical, and a disinterested observer had"
"been available, it would at this moment have been interesting to observe"
the demeanour of Concha. Feeling that in a manner she was present on
"sufferance, she could not of course make any objection to the plan of"
"escalade, nor could she offer to accompany Rollo and the Sergeant, but"
"with clasped hands and tightly compressed lips she stood beneath,"
repeating under her breath quick-succeeding prayers for the safety of
one (or both) of the adventurers.
So patent and eager was her anxiety even in the gloom of the night that
"La Giralda, to whom her agitation was manifest, laid her hand on the"
three lobes into which its shell is divided longitudinally. There
"are also three cross divisions,--the head shield, the tail shield,"
"and between the two the thorax, consisting of a number of distinct"
and unconsolidated segments. The head shield carries a pair of
"large, crescentic, compound eyes, like those of the insect. The"
"eye varies greatly in the number of its lenses, ranging from"
fourteen in some species to fifteen thousand in others. Figure
"268, C, is a restoration of the trilobite, and shows the"
"appendages, which are found preserved only in the rarest cases."
During the long ages of the Cambrian the trilobite varied greatly.
"Again and again new species and genera appeared, while the older"
types became extinct. For this reason and because of their
"abundance, trilobites are used in the classification of the"
Cambrian system. The Lower Cambrian is characterized by the
presence of a trilobitic fauna in which the genus Olenellus is
"predominant. This, the OLENELLUS ZONE, is one of the most"
"important platforms in the entire geological series; for, the"
"world over, it marks the beginning of Paleozoic time, while all"
underlying strata are classified as pre-Cambrian. The Middle
"Cambrian is marked by the genus Paradoxides, and the Upper"
Cambrian by the genus Olenus. Some of the Cambrian trilobites were
"giants, measuring as much as two feet long, while others were the"
"smallest of their kind, a fraction of an inch in length."
Another type of crustacean which lived in the Cambrian and whose
order is still living is illustrated in Figure 269.

"of hard parts, would leave no record."
THE SILURIAN
The narrowing of the seas and the emergence of the lands which
characterized the closing epoch of the Ordovician in eastern North
America continue into the succeeding period of the Silurian. New
species appear and many old species now become extinct.
THE APPALACHIAN REGION. Where the Silurian system is most fully
"developed, from New York southward along the Appalachian"
"Mountains, it comprises four series:"
"4 Salina  . . . shales, impure limestones, gypsum, salt"
3 Niagara . . . chiefly limestones
"2 Clinton . . . sandstones, shales, with some limestones"
"1 Medina  . . . conglomerates, sandstones"
The rocks of these series are shallow-water deposits and reach the
total thickness of some five thousand feet. Evidently they were
"laid over an area which was on the whole gradually subsiding,"
although with various gentle oscillations which are recorded in
the different formations. The coarse sands of the heavy Medina
"formations record a period of uplift of the oldland of Appalachia,"
when erosion went on rapidly and coarse waste in abundance was
brought down from the hills by swift streams and spread by the
"waves in wide, sandy flats. As the lands were worn lower the waste"

"there were deposited various formations of sandstones, shales, and"
limestones. The Niagara limestones testify to a long epoch of

advantage of the fact that the attention of the British seaplanes and
"destroyers was centred on the fugitive Taubes, these giant airships,"
"by reason of their altitude, were able to manoeuvre immediately above"
the flotilla.
"It was an opportunity too good to be missed, for although the"
objective of the Zeppelins was a raid on London--they having decided
upon a circuitous course over Kent and Sussex borders in order to
avoid the air-stations at the Isle of Grain--the chance of raining a
shower of bombs upon the British cruiser and her attendant destroyers
was too tempting.
"For once, at least, the German Admiralty had not been kept well"
"posted as to the details of armament of the cruisers of the ""Town"
"Class,"" for the ""Sunderland"" and her consorts had recently been"
equipped with a couple of 12-pounder anti-aircraft guns. These
weapons fired a shell of unique character. Somewhat resembling a
"shrapnel, the missile was packed with short lengths of chain and"
charged with a high explosive.
Almost as soon as the Zeppelins were discovered both guns barked
venomously. From the point of view of the observers on the
"""Sunderland's"" bridge the shells appeared to burst close to the frail"
"targets. Both airships were observed to pitch violently, while one,"
"with her nose tilted downwards, began to descend."
"""She's done for!"" exclaimed Terence."
A round of cheering burst from the throats of the crew. It seemed as
if nothing could arrest the seaward plunge of one of the Kaiser's
gas-bags. Not only had her bow compartments been holed but the

community act as intermediaries in any trading relations between the
Sinaketans and the inhabitants of more remote districts.
"To sum up the sociology of these transactions, we may say that"
the visitor enters into a threefold relation with the Dobuan
"natives. First, there is his partner, with whom he exchanges general"
"gifts on the basis of free give and take, a type of transaction,"
running side by side with the Kula proper. Then there is the local
"resident, not his personal Kula partner, with whom he carries on"
gimwali. Finally there is the stranger with whom an indirect exchange
is carried on through the intermediation of the local men. With
"all this, it must not be imagined that the commercial aspect of"
the gathering is at all conspicuous. The concourse of the natives
"is great, mainly owing to their curiosity, to see the ceremonial"
reception of the uvalaku party. But if I say that every visitor from
"Boyowa, brings and carries away about half-a-dozen articles, I do"
not under-state the case. Some of these articles the Sinaketan has
acquired in the industrial districts of Boyowa during his preliminary
"trading expedition (see Chapter VI, Division III). On these he scores"
a definite gain. A few samples of the prices paid in Boyowa and those
received in Dobu will indicate the amount of this gain.

will be forever maintained against all comers--except the United States
itself. There are political philosophers who think that the Isthmus

"foundling hospitals, apparently), in 1890 the total Swedish rate was"
"slightly below 1 to 10, while in Norway it was 1 to 14. The modern"
facilities for emigration have further affected conjugal habits.
"Latterly, however, there are evidences of a new growth of intelligent"
control.
In recent years the statistics of emigration and population tell a
fairly plain story. In Norway and Sweden alike the excess of births over
"deaths reached nearly its highest in 1887, the figures being 63,942 for"
"Sweden and 29,233 for Norway. In 1887, however, emigration was about its"
"maximum in both countries, 50,786 leaving Sweden and 20,706 leaving"
"Norway. Thereafter the birth-rate rapidly fell, and the emigration,"
"though fluctuating, has never again risen in Sweden to the volume of"
"1887-88, though it has in Norway. But when, after falling to 43,728 in"
"1892, the excess of Swedish births over deaths rises to 60,231 in 1895,"
"while the emigration falls from 45,000 in 1892 to 13,000 in 1894, it is"
clear that the lesson of regulation is still very imperfectly learned.
"Norway shows the same fluctuations, the excess of births rising from"
"23,600 in 1892 to nearly 32,000 in 1896, and again from 27,685 in 1908"
"to 29,804 in 1909, doubtless because of ups and downs in the harvests,"
"as shown in the increase of marriages from 12,742 in 1892 to 13,962 in"
1896.
In Denmark the progression has been similar. There the excess of births
"over deaths was so far at its maximum in 1886, the figures being 29,986"
"in a population of a little over 2,000,000; whereafter they slowly"
"decreased, till in 1893 the excess was only 26,235. All the while"
"emigration was active, gradually rising from 4,346 in 1885 to 10,382 in"
"1891; then again falling to 2,876 in 1896, when the surplus of births"
"over deaths was 34,181--a development sure to force more emigration. In"
"1911 the population was 2,775,076--a rapid rise; and in 1910 the surplus"
"of births over deaths was 40,110. The Scandinavians are thus still in"
"their independence (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 375, 376; Geijer, pp."
"50, 81, 89, 97, 103), so that they ultimately enabled Gustavus Vasa"
to throw off the Danish yoke. Yet they had at first refused to
"recognise him, being satisfied with their own liberties; and"
"afterwards they gave him much serious trouble (Otté, _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, pp. 228, 235; Geijer, pp. 109, 112, 115, 116, 118,"
"120-24). Slavery, too, was definitely abolished in Sweden as early"
"as 1335 (Geijer, pp. 57, 86; Crichton and Wheaton, i, 316, 333). As"
"regards the regal power, the once dominant theory that the Swedish"
"kings in the thirteenth century obtained a grant of all the mines,"
"and of the province of the four great lakes (Crichton and Wheaton,"
"i, 332), appears to be an entire delusion (Geijer, pp. 51, 52)."
Such claims were first enforced by Gustavus Vasa (_id._ p. 129). As
"regards the clergy, they appear from the first, _quâ_ churchmen, to"
"have been kept in check by the nobles, who kept the great Church"
"offices largely in the hands of their own order (Geijer, p. 109),"
though Magnus Ladulas strove to strengthen the Church in his own
interest (_id._ pp. 52-53). Thus the nobles became specially
"powerful (_id._ pp. 50, 56, 108); and when in the fifteenth century"
"Sweden was subject to Denmark, they specially resented the"
"sacerdotal tyranny (Crichton and Wheaton, i, 356)."
"In Sweden, as in the other Scandinavian States, however, physical strife"
and mental stagnation were the ruling conditions. Down till the
"sixteenth century her history is pronounced ""a wretched detail of civil"
"wars, insurrections, and revolutions, arising principally from the"
"jealousies subsisting between the kings and the people, the one striving"
"to augment their power, the other to maintain their independence.""[670]"
"The same may be said of the sister kingdoms, all alike being torn and"
drained by innumerable strifes of faction and wars with each other. The
occasional forcible and dynastic unions of crowns came to nothing; and

"indicators, telltales, and terminals, the upper ones reached by a chair"
on a boom.
"Although, as far as anyone knew, it could sense only the information"
"and questions fed into it on a tape, the human visitors could not"
resist the impulse to talk in whispers and glance uneasily at the great
"cryptic cube. After all, it had lately taken to moving some of its"
own controls--the permissible ones--and could doubtless improvise a
hearing apparatus if it wanted to.
For this was the thinking machine beside which the Marks and Eniacs and
Maniacs and Maddidas and Minervas and Mimirs were less than Morons.
This was the machine with a million times as many synapses as the human
"brain, the machine that remembered by cutting delicate notches in the"
rims of molecules (instead of kindergarten paper-punching or the Coney
Island shimmying of columns of mercury). This was the machine that had
given instructions on building the last three-quarters of itself. This
"was the goal, perhaps, toward which fallible human reasoning and biased"
human judgment and feeble human ambition had evolved.
_This was the machine that really thought--a million-plus!_
This was the machine that the timid cyberneticists and stuffy
professional scientists had said could not be built. Yet this was the
"machine that the Thinkers, with characteristic Yankee push, _had_"
"built. And nicknamed, with characteristic Yankee irreverence and"
"girl-fondness, ""Maizie."""

"The husband died, and Mary once again donned male attire and enlisted in a"
"regiment in Holland. Soon tiring of this, she deserted, and shipped"
herself aboard a vessel bound for the West Indies. This ship was taken by
"an English pirate, Captain Rackam, and Mary joined his crew as a seaman."
"She was at New Providence Island, Bahama, when Woodes Rogers came there"
"with the royal pardon to all pirates, and she shipped herself aboard a"
privateer sent out by Rogers to cruise against the Spaniards. The crew
"mutinied and again became pirates. She now sailed under Captain Rackam,"
"who had with him another woman pirate, Anne Bonny. They took a large"
"number of ships belonging to Jamaica, and out of one of these took"
"prisoner ""a young fellow of engaging behaviour"" with whom Mary fell deeply"
"in love. This young fellow had a quarrel with one of the pirates, and as"
the ship lay at anchor they were to go to fight it out on shore according
"to pirate law. Mary, to save her lover, picked a quarrel with the same"
"pirate, and managed to have her duel at once, and fighting with sword and"
pistol killed him on the spot.
"She now married the young man ""of engaging behaviour,"" and not long after"
was taken prisoner with Captain Rackam and the rest of the crew to
"Jamaica. She was tried at St. Jago de la Vega in Jamaica, and on November"
"28th, 1720, was convicted, but died in prison soon after of a violent"
fever.
That Mary Read was a woman of great spirit is shown by her reply to
"Captain Rackam, who had asked her (thinking she was a young man) what"
"pleasure she could find in a life continually in danger of death by fire,"

"""Eighty yards short,"" came the wireless report of the observing"
"seaplane that, hovering a bare five hundred feet above the German"
"mobile battery, had marked the point of impact of the shells."
Again a salvo was let loose. This time came the encouraging statement
"that the hostile guns were knocked clean out of action, and that"
swarms of artillerymen and infantry were scurrying across the dunes.
The next discharge practically annihilated the fugitives. In one
"minute and twenty-five seconds the ""Sunderland's"" particular task was"
"accomplished. It was but the beginning, for acting upon orders from"
the flagship she was ordered to engage a battery at close range.
"Meanwhile, the rest of the battleships and cruisers had not been"
idle. A perfect tornado of shell was being directed upon the Belgian
shore.
"""Hard aport!"" shouted the captain of the ""Sunderland."""
"Round swung the cruiser, only just avoiding the tell-tale line of"
bubbles that marked the track of a torpedo. With consummate daring a
German submarine had dived under a part of the torpedo-boat destroyer
"flotilla, and had discharged a weapon at the British cruiser. The"
"torpedo, having missed the ""Sunderland,"" was tearing straight for one"
"of the monitors, which, having to go full speed astern to avoid a"
"collision with a couple of damaged destroyers, was now practically"
stationary.
Owing to the light draught the weapon passed six feet beneath her
"keel, and finishing its run rose to the surface three hundred yards"
"beyond; for, instead of the torpedo sinking at the end of its course,"
"The man was placed in a tent by himself, and to my surprise was"
alive and better the next morning; the expression was still
"anxious, but the face brighter and not sweating; the pulse"
"only numbered 100, but was very weak, and the hands and feet"
"were cold. The condition of the abdomen was unaltered, but the"
thoracic respiration had decreased in rapidity from 48 to 28.
His condition still seemed to preclude any chance of successful
"intervention, but none the less life was retained until the"
"morning of the seventh day, the state alternating between a"
moribund one and one of slight improvement. He was lucid at
"times, although for the most part wandering, and was so"
restless that no covering could be kept upon him. Vomiting was
"continuous, so that no nourishment could be retained; the"
"bowels acted frequently involuntarily, and little or no urine"
"was passed. Meanwhile, the abdomen became flat, then sunken, an"
area of induration and tenderness about 6 inches in diameter
developing around the wound of entry. Slight variations in the
"pulse, and from normal to subnormal in the temperature, were"
"noted, and death eventually occurred from septicæmia and"
inanition.

"posterior third of the left iliac crest, at the margin of the"
last lumbar transverse process (probably through ilio-lumbar
"ligament); _exit_, 1 inch below and to the left of the"
umbilicus.
"The patient was wounded at 3 P.M., but not brought into the"
"Field hospital until 9 P.M., when the temperature of the tents"
"was below 28°F. He was considerably collapsed, suffering much"
"pain, and vomited freely. The abdomen was flat, but very"

incognito.
"As a result of this royal visit, which was made for the purpose of seeing"
"Frances, a part of Sir Richard's estates near St. Albans were restored to"
"him, and from poverty he rose at once to a comfortable income of, say, a"
thousand or twelve hundred pounds a year.
"Immediately all of Sir Richard's hatred of Charles II fell away, and once"
more the king shone in the resplendent light of his divine appointment.
"While Frances estimated the king's generosity at its true value, she was"
"glad her father had received even a small part of what was his just due,"
"and although she knew the restoration had been made to please, and, if"
"possible, to win her, she was glad to have spoiled the royal Philistine,"
"and despised him more than ever before, if that were possible."
"Sir Richard's good fortune brought a gleam of joy to Frances, but it also"
"brought a pang of regret, because it had come too late. Her only purpose"
in going to Whitehall had been to marry a rich nobleman and thereby raise
"the fallen fortunes of her house. Now that reason existed no longer, and"
"if George were here, she could throw herself away upon him with injury to"
"no one but herself. But George was not here, and liberty to throw herself"
away had come too late to be of any value.
"Every day during the fortnight that Frances remained at home, she asked"
"if I had any news from court, meaning the French court, but using the"
form of inquiry to avoid acquainting her father and Sarah with the real
cause of her solicitude.

"been hampered all through the summer by indisposition, and who had, on"
"that account, been unable to finish it, fell seriously ill. He reached"
"Louvain with difficulty (21 September 1518). It might be the pestilence,"
"and Erasmus, ever much afraid of contagion himself, now took all"
precautions to safeguard his friends against it. He avoided his quarters
"in the College of the Lily, and found shelter with his most trusted"
"friend, Dirck Maertensz, the printer. But in spite of rumours of the"

"badly by him, after all."

But the differences between Erasmus and the Louvain faculty were deeply
"rooted. Lee, hurt by the little attention paid by Erasmus to his"
"objections, prepared a new critique, but kept it from Erasmus, for the"
"present, which irritated the latter and made him nervous. In the"
"meantime a new opponent arose. Directly after his return to Louvain,"
Erasmus had taken much trouble to promote the establishment of the
"_Collegium Trilingue_, projected and endowed by Jerome Busleiden, in his"
"testament, to be founded in the university. The three biblical"
"languages, Hebrew, Greek and Latin, were to be taught there. Now when"
"James Latomus, a member of the theological faculty and a man whom he"
"esteemed, in a dialogue about the study of those three languages and of"
"theology, doubted the utility of the former, Erasmus judged himself"
"concerned, and answered Latomus in an _Apologia_. About the same time"
(spring 1519) he got into trouble with the vice-chancellor himself.
Erasmus thought that Ath had publicly censured him with regard to his
"'Praise of Marriage', which had recently appeared. Though Ath withdrew"
"at once, Erasmus could not abstain from writing an _Apologia_, however"
the Vakutans have never fished for kaloma in the Sanaroa Lagoon.
Now let us describe the technicalities and the ceremonial connected
with the fishing for kaloma. It will be better to give an account
"of how this is done in the Lagoon of Sinaketa, round the sandbank"
"of Nanoula, as this is the normal and typical form of kaloma"
"fishing. Moreover, when the Sinaketans do it in Sanaroa, the"
"proceedings are very much the same, with just one or two phases"
missed out.
The office of magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma) is hereditary in
"two sub-clans, belonging to the Malasi clan, and one of them is that"
"of the main chief of Kasi'etana. After the Monsoon season is over,"
"that is, some time in March or April, ogibukuvi (i.e., in the season"
of the new yams) the magician gives the order for preparations. The
"community give him a gift called sousula, one or two bringing a"
"vaygu'a, the rest supplying gugu'a (ordinary chattels), and some"
"food. Then they prepare the canoes, and get ready the binabina stones,"
with which the spondylus shell will be knocked off the reef.
"Next day, in the morning, the magician performs a rite called"
"'kaykwa'una la'i,' 'the attracting of the reef,' for, as in the"
"case of several other marine beings, the main seat of the kaloma is"
"far away. Its dwelling place is the reef Ketabu, somewhere between"
"Sanaroa and Dobu. In order to make it move and come towards Nanoula,"
it is necessary to recite the above-named spell. This is done by the
magician as he walks up and down on the Sinaketa beach and casts
"his words into the open, over the sea, towards the distant seat"
of the kaloma. The kaloma then 'stand up' (itolise) that is start
from their original coral outcrop (vatu) and come into the Lagoon of
"Sinaketa. This spell, I obtained from To'udavada, the present chief"
"of Kasi'etana, and descendant of the original giver of this shell,"
"fall into the Gulf of Perdition, unless God interposes.”"
"Now, apart from the folly of this story, we must condemn it on moral"
grounds. Could we imagine a lower standard of a Deity than that
presented here to the child?
To-day the teacher would commend Jane for a laudable interest in
"botany, but might add a word of caution about choosing inclined planes"
"as a hunting-ground for specimens and a popular, lucid explanation of"
the inexorable law of gravity.
Here we have an instance of applying a moral when we have finished our
"story, but there are many stories where nothing is left to chance in"
"this matter, and where there is no means for the child to use ingenuity"
or imagination in making out the meaning for himself.
Henry Morley has condemned the use of this method as applied to Fairy
Stories. He says: “Moralising in a Fairy Story is like the snoring of

THE ALGONKIAN
In some regions there rests unconformably on the Archean an
"immense body of stratified rocks, thousands and in places even"
"scores of thousands of feet thick, known as the ALGONKIAN. Great"
"unconformities divide it into well-defined systems, but as only"
the scantiest traces of fossils appear here and there among its
"strata, it is as yet impossible to correlate the formations of"
different regions and to give them names of more than local
application. We will describe the Algonkian rocks of two typical
areas.
THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO. We have already studied a very
ancient peneplain whose edge is exposed to view deep on the walls
of the Colorado Canyon. The formation of flat-lying sandstone
which covers this buried land surface is proved by its fossils to
"belong to the Cambrian,--the earliest period of the Paleozoic era."
The tilted rocks on whose upturned edges the Cambrian sandstone
"rests are far older, for the physical break which separates them"
from it records a time interval during which they were upheaved to
mountainous ridges and worn down to a low plain. They are
therefore classified as Algonkian. They comprise two immense
series. The upper is more than five thousand feet thick and
consists of shales and sandstones with some limestones. Separated
"from it by an unconformity which does not appear in Figure 207,"
"the lower division, seven thousand feet thick, consists chiefly of"
massive reddish sandstones with seven or more sheets of lava
interbedded. The lowest member is a basal conglomerate composed of
pebbles derived from the erosion of the dark crumpled schists
"beneath,--schists which are supposed to be Archean. As shown in"
Athwart the raptures of a vision'd bliss.
"""I'll seek no joy that is not linked with thine,"
"No touch of hope, no taste of holy wine,"
"And after death, no home in any star,"
"That is not shared by thee, supreme, afar"
As here thou'rt first and foremost of all things!
"Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings"
"That wait on thought, when, in thy spirit-sway,"
"Thou dost invest a realm unknown to kings!"""
"Had not she, Edris, consigned him to his ""own disdain, Athwart the"
"raptures of a visioned bliss?"" Ay! truly and deservedly!--and this"
"disdain of himself had now reached its culminating point,--namely, that"
"he did not consider himself worthy of her love,--or worthy to do aught"
than sink again into far spaces of darkness and perpetually
"retrospective Memory, there to explore the uttermost depths of anguish,"
"and count up his errors one by one from the very beginning of life, in"
"every separate phase he had passed through, till he had penitently"
"striven his best to atone for them all! Christ had atoned! yes,--but"
was it not almost base on his part to shield himself with that Divine
Light and do nothing further? He could not yet thoroughly grasp the
"amazing truth that ONE ABSOLUTELY PURE act of faith in Christ, blots"
"out Past Sin forever,--it seemed too marvellous and great a boon!"
When he retired to rest that night he was fully and firmly PREPARED TO
DIE. With this expectation upon him he was nevertheless happy and
"tranquil. The line--""Glory is thine, and gladness, and the wings"""
"haunted him, and he repeated it over and over again without knowing"
why. Wings! the brilliant shafts of radiance that part angels from
"mortals,--wings, that, after all, are not really wings, but lambent"

recent years lived by fishing up sponges and at times supplying shark
meat to the poorer quarter of Key West. The carcass of a water fowl tied
"to his boat, while he occupied himself with sponges, would sometimes"
"attract a shark; then he would strip, take a knife in his teeth, and"
dive.
"I glanced at Gates, but saw no incredulity in his face."
"In another hour, at nearly dusk, Key West had grown small and finally"
"sank below the horizon, leaving only its three skeleton-like towers"
"standing against the sky--standing erect with all nerves strained,"
"watch-dogs of the darkening sea; ears cocked, to catch a distressed cry"
from some waif out in the mysterious night.
Looking back along our wake I imagined the big black man standing as we
"had left him on the dock, gazing after us with patient regret; and I was"
"glad to have given him the handful of coins at parting, little dreaming"
how many times that loaf upon the water would come floating in to me.
Monsieur Dragot revealed himself more and more to our astonished eyes as
we sat that night on deck. He had been a professor in the University of
"Bucharest, and hinted at an intimate entente with the reigning house of"
"Azuria. Besides being versed in many sciences, including medicine, he"
spoke seven languages and read several others. But these things were
"drawn from him by Tommy's artful questions, rather than being said in"
"boastfulness. Indeed, Monsieur was charmingly, almost touchily, modest."
"Of his business in Havana he gave no hint, yet this happened to be the"
one piece of information that Tommy seemed most possessed to find out.
"""You'll be in Cuba long, Monsieur?"" he asked."
"On seeing him, they would come forward from all corners of the"
"court-yard, drunk, or suffering from drunken headache, dishevelled,"
"tattered, miserable, and pitiable.  Then would come the barrel-like,"
"stout Aleksei Maksimovitch Simtsoff, formerly Inspector of Woods and"
"Forests, under the Department of Appendages, but now trading in"
"matches, ink, blacking, and lemons. He was an old man of sixty, in a"
"canvas overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat, the greasy borders of which hid"
"his stout fat red face.  He had a thick white beard, out of which a"
"small red nose turned gaily heavenwards.  He had thick, crimson lips"
"and watery, cynical eyes.  They called him ""Kubar,"" a name which well"
"described his round figure and buzzing speech.  After him, Kanets"
"appeared from some corner--a dark, sad-looking, silent drunkard: then"
"the former governor of the prison, Luka Antonovitch Martyanoff, a man"
"who existed on ""remeshok,"" ""trilistika,"" and ""bankovka,""* and many such"
"cunning games, not much appreciated by the police.  He would throw his"
"hard and oft-scourged body on the grass beside the teacher, and,"
"turning his eyes round and scratching his head, would ask in a hoarse,"
"bass voice, ""May I?"""
"*Note by translator.--Well-known games of chance, played by the lower"
"classes.  The police specially endeavour to stop them, but"
unsuccessfully.
"Then appeared Pavel Solntseff, a man of thirty years of age, suffering"
from consumption.  The ribs of his left side had been broken in a
"quarrel, and the sharp, yellow face, like that of a fox, always wore a"
"malicious smile.  The thin lips, when opened, exposed two rows of"
"decayed black teeth, and the rags on his shoulders swayed backwards and"
forwards as if they were hung on a clothes pole.  They called him
"""Abyedok.""  He hawked brushes and bath brooms of his own manufacture,"
good strong brushes made from a peculiar kind of grass.
of Montaigne. In Erasmus's writings that ideal wish ever recurs in the
"shape of a friendly walk, followed by a meal in a garden-house. It is"
"found as an opening scene of the _Antibarbari_, in the numerous"
"descriptions of meals with Colet, and the numerous _Convivia_ of the"
_Colloquies_. Especially in the _Convivium religiosum_ Erasmus has
"elaborately pictured his dream, and it would be worth while to compare"
"it, on the one hand with Thélème, and on the other with the fantastic"
design of a pleasure garden which Bernard Palissy describes. The little
Dutch eighteenth-century country-seats and garden-houses in which the
national spirit took great delight are the fulfilment of a purely
Erasmian ideal. The host of the _Convivium religiosum_ says: 'To me a
"simple country-house, a nest, is pleasanter than any palace, and, if he"
"be king who lives in freedom and according to his wishes, surely I am"
king here'.
Life's true joy is in virtue and piety. If they are Epicureans who live
"pleasantly, then none are more truly Epicureans than they who live in"
holiness and piety.
The ideal joy of life is also perfectly idyllic in so far that it
requires an aloofness from earthly concerns and contempt for all that is
sordid. It is foolish to be interested in all that happens in the world;
"to pride oneself on one's knowledge of the market, of the King of"
"England's plans, the news from Rome, conditions in Denmark. The sensible"
"old man of the _Colloquium Senile_ has an easy post of honour, a safe"
"mediocrity, he judges no one and nothing and smiles upon all the world."
"Quiet for oneself, surrounded by books--that is of all things most"
desirable.
On the outskirts of this ideal of serenity and harmony numerous flowers
"of aesthetic value blow, such as Erasmus's sense of decorum, his great"
"need of kindly courtesy, his pleasure in gentle and obliging treatment,"
"have been splendid and of some use.” Given the character of the lady,"
"we might, as adults, question the last part of the boy's statement, but"
this is pure cynicism and fortunately does not enter into the child's
calculations.
In my own personal experience (and I have told this story often in the
German ballad form to girls of ten and twelve in the High Schools in
England) I have never found one girl who sympathised with the lady or
who failed to appreciate the poetic justice meted out to her in the end
by the dignified renunciation of the knight.
"Chesterton defines sentimentality as “a tame, cold, or small and"
inadequate manner of speaking about certain matters which demand very
large and beautiful expression.”
"I would strongly urge upon young teachers to revise, by this"
"definition, some of the stories they have included in their repertory,"
and see whether they would stand the test or not.
IV.--_Stories containing strong sensational episodes._ The danger is
"all the greater because many children delight in it, and some crave for"
"it in the abstract, but fear it in the concrete.[19]"
"An affectionate aunt, on one occasion, anxious to curry favour with"
"a four-year-old nephew, was taxing her imagination to find a story"
suitable for his tender years. She was greatly startled when he
"suddenly said, in a most imperative tone: “Tell me the story of a"
_bear_ eating a small boy.” This was so remote from her own choice
"of subject that she hesitated at first, but coming to the conclusion"
that as the child had chosen the situation he would feel no terror
"in the working up of its details, she began a most thrilling and"
"blood-curdling story, leading up to the final catastrophe. But just as"
of English history from the earliest times down to the Revolution of
"1688. This last event inspired him with special interest, because the"
"Whigs and their philosophic champion, Locke, maintained that James II."
had violated the original contract between prince and people.
Everywhere in his notes Napoleon emphasizes the incidents which led to
"conflicts between dynasties or between rival principles. In fact,"
through all these voracious studies there appear signs of his
"determination to write a history of Corsica; and, while inspiriting"
"his kinsmen by recalling the glorious past, he sought to weaken the"
"French monarchy by inditing a ""Dissertation sur l'Autorité Royale."""
His first sketch of this work runs as follows:
"""23 October, 1788. Auxonne."
"""This work will begin with general ideas as to the origin and the"
enhanced prestige of the name of king. Military rule is favourable
to it: this work will afterwards enter into the details of the
usurped authority enjoyed by the Kings of the twelve Kingdoms of
Europe.
"""There are very few Kings who have not deserved dethronement[12]."""
This curt pronouncement is all that remains of the projected work. It
"sufficiently indicates, however, the aim of Napoleon's studies. One"
and all they were designed to equip him for the great task of
re-awakening the spirit of the Corsicans and of sapping the base of
the French monarchy.
But these reams of manuscript notes and crude literary efforts have an
even wider source of interest. They show how narrow was his outlook on
life. It all turned on the regeneration of Corsica by methods which he
"himself prescribed. We are therefore able to understand why, when his"
"in places on the sea floor, secreting stony masses composed of"
"thin, close, concentric layers, connected by vertical rods. The"
Stromatopora are among the chief limestone builders of the
Silurian and Devonian periods.
"CORALS developed along several distinct lines, like modern corals"
"they secreted a calcareous framework, in whose outer portions the"
"polyps lived. In the Ordovician, corals were represented chiefly"
"by the family of the CHOETETES, all species of which are long"
since extinct. The description of other types of corals will be
"given under the Silurian, where they first became abundant."
"ECHINODERMS. The cystoid reaches its climax, but there appear now"
"two higher types of echinoderms,--the crinoid and the starfish."
"The CRINOID, named from its resemblance to the lily, is like the"
"cystoid in many respects, but has a longer stem and supports a"
"crown of plumose arms. Stirring the water with these arms, it"
creates currents by which particles of food are wafted to its
"mouth. Crinoids are rare at the present time, but they grew in the"
greatest profusion in the warm Ordovician seas and for long ages
thereafter. In many places the sea floor was beautiful with these
"graceful, flowerlike forms, as with fields of long-stemmed lilies."
"Of the higher, free-moving classes of the echinoderms, starfish"
"are more numerous than in the Cambrian, and sea urchins make their"
appearance in rare archaic forms.
CRUSTACEANS. Trilobites now reach their greatest development and
more than eleven hundred species have been described from the
rocks of this period. It is interesting to note that in many
species the segments of the thorax have now come to be so shaped
that they move freely on one another. Unlike their Cambrian
"ancestors, many of the Ordovician trilobites could roll themselves"
has been unbroken since its beginning.
5. THE CHANGE IN SPECIES HAS BEEN A GRADUAL DIFFERENTIATION.
Tracing the lines of descent of various animals and plants of the
"present backward through the divisions of geologic time, we find"
that these lines of descent converge and unite in simpler and
still simpler types. The development of life may be represented by
a tree whose trunk is found in the earliest ages and whose
branches spread and subdivide to the growing twigs of present
species.
6. THE CHANGE IN ORGANISMS THROUGHOUT GEOLOGIC TIME HAS BEEN A
PROGRESSIVE CHANGE. In the earliest ages the only animals and
"plants on the earth were lowly forms, simple and generalized in"
structure; while succeeding ages have been characterized by the
"introduction of types more and more specialized and complex, and"
therefore of higher rank in the scale of being. Thus the Algonkian
contains the remains of only the humblest forms of the
"invertebrates. In the Cambrian, Ordovician, and Silurian the"
invertebrates were represented in all their subkingdoms by a
"varied fauna. In the Devonian, fishes--the lowest of the"
vertebrates--became abundant. Amphibians made their entry on the
"stage in the Carboniferous, and reptiles came to rule the world in"
the Mesozoic. Mammals culminated in the Tertiary in strange forms
which became more and more like those of the present as the long
ages of that era rolled on; and latest of all appeared the noblest
"product of the creative process, man."
"Just as growth is characteristic of the individual life, so"
"gradual, progressive change, or evolution, has characterized the"
history of life upon the planet. The evolution of the organic
kingdom from its primitive germinal forms to the complex and
The man who was chosen by Cabrera to accompany them on their mission was
"of a most remarkable appearance. Tall, almost as tall as El Sarria, he"
was yet distinguished from his fellows by a notable gauntness and
angularity of figure.
"""A step-ladder with the bottom bars missing!"" was Rollo's mental"
"description of him, as he stood before them in a uniform jacket much too"
"tight for him, through which his ribs showed not unlike the spars of a"
ladder.
But in other respects Sergeant Cardono was a remarkable man. The iron
"gravity of his countenance, seamed on the right-hand side by a deep"
"scar, took no new expression when he found himself detailed by his"
general for this new and dangerous mission.
With a single salute he fell out and instantly attached himself to
"Rollo, whom he relieved of his knapsack and waterbottle on the spot."
"Sergeant Cardono paid no attention whatever to the other three, whom he"
evidently regarded as very subordinate members of the expedition.
As soon as they arrived at the village where they were to part from the
"command of Cabrera, Sergeant Cardono promptly disappeared. He was not"
"seen for several hours, during which Rollo and El Sarria wandered here"
and there endeavouring in that poor place to pick up some sustenance
which would serve them in lieu of a dinner. They had but poor success. A
"round of black bread, a fowl of amazing age, vitality, and muscular"
"development, with a few snails, were all that they could obtain by their"
"best persuasions, aided by the money with which Rollo was plentifully"
supplied. John Mortimer looked disconsolately on. He had added a little
"ham on his own account, which last he had brought in his saddle-bags"
"from the venta of Sarria. But everything pointed to a sparse meal, and"
even the philosophic Etienne shrugged his shoulders and departed to
rigorous equality preached by Rousseau.
The new constitution of 1791 was also a source of discord. In its
"jealousy of the royal authority, the National Assembly seized very"
many of the executive functions of government. The results were
"disastrous. Laws remained without force, taxes went uncollected, the"
"army was distracted by mutinies, and the monarchy sank slowly into the"
"gulf of bankruptcy and anarchy. Thus, in the course of three years,"
"the revolutionists goaded the clergy to desperation, they were about"
"to overthrow the monarchy, every month was proving their local"
"self-government to be unworkable, and they themselves split into"
factions that plunged France into war and drenched her soil by
organized massacres.

We know very little about the impression made on the young Buonaparte
by the first events of the Revolution. His note-book seems even to
show that he regarded them as an inconvenient interference with his
plans for Corsica. But gradually the Revolution excites his interest.
"In September, 1789, we find him on furlough in Corsica sharing the"
hopes of the islanders that their representatives in the French
National Assembly will obtain the boon of independence. He exhorts
"his compatriots to favour the democratic cause, which promises a"
speedy deliverance from official abuses. He urges them to don the new
"tricolour cockade, symbol of Parisian triumph over the old monarchy;"
"to form a club; above all, to organize a National Guard. The young"
"officer knew that military power was passing from the royal army, now"
"honeycombed with discontent, to the National Guard. Here surely was"
Corsica's means of salvation. But the French governor of Corsica
"intervenes. The club is closed, and the National Guard is dispersed."
Thereupon Buonaparte launches a vigorous protest against the tyranny
"found the Guaymies, the only primitive people living in large numbers"
"outside the Darien. There are about 5000 of them, living for the most"
"part in the valley of Mirando which lies high up in the Cordilleras, and"
in a region cut off from the plains. Here they have successfully
defended their independence against the assaults of both whites and
blacks. To remain in their country without consent of the Great Chief is
"practically impossible, for they are savage fighters and in earlier days"
it was rare to see a man whose body was not covered with scars. It is
apparent that in some ways progress has destroyed their industries and
"made the people less rather than more civilized, for they now buy cloth,"
"arms, tools, and utensils which they were once able to make. At one time"
"they were much under the influence of the Catholic missionaries, but of"
late mission work has languished in wild Panama and perhaps the chief
relic of that earlier religious influence is the fact that the women go
"clothed in a single garment. This simple raiment, not needed for warmth,"
"seems to be prized, for if caught in a rainstorm the women will quickly"
"strip off their clothing, wrap it in a large banana or palm leaf that it"
"may not get wet, and continue their work, or their play, in nature’s"
garb.
"It is said, too, that when strangers are not near clothes are never"
"thought of. The men follow a like custom, and invariably when pursuing a"
"quarry strip off their trousers, tying their shirts about their loins."
"Trousers seem to impede their movements, and if a lone traveler in"
Chiriqui comes on a row of blue cotton trousers tied to the bushes he
may be sure that a band of Guaymies is somewhere in the neighborhood
pursuing an ant bear or a deer.

"Hurrying on, Bob presently caught up with a throng of his own men, who"
"had apparently just landed from the dangerous, constantly shifting"
"surface of the river. They looked at him with a frank curiosity, as if"
wondering what he meant to do in this emergency. On the faces of a few
"were expressions of grim, anticipatory amusement, but Bainbridge heeded"
these no more than he had the others. Without pausing even glancing to
"right or left, he strode on, and reached the scene of action."
"On the same bank, a little way back from the water, stood a small"
"building, so hastily thrown together that the roof was not yet"
"completed. One or two men were standing near it, staring interestedly at"
the crowd gathered about something at the water’s edge which Bob at once
"saw to be one end of a massive, well-constructed log boom. The other"
"end, out beyond the middle of the river, was supported by some stout"
"spiles, and the whole affair took up so much of the stream’s width that"
Bainbridge’s drive had jammed against it hard and fast.
All this Bob took in without slackening his pace. Reaching the outer
"edge of the circle, he pushed through to where Jack Peters, his jam"
"boss, stood facing a compact group of six or eight strangers, gathered"
"closely about the end of the boom, Jack was florid with rage, and"
choking with impotent fury. The strangers composing the little group
instantly struck Bob as being singularly strong and rugged. They looked
as if they had been picked for their physical efficiency. Each one was
"armed with rifle or pistol, while their leader, a competent-looking"
"person with red hair and whiskers, held in one hand a snub-nosed,"
businesslike automatic.
"“Well, Jack,” Bainbridge said curtly, as he reached the foreman’s side,"
“what’s the trouble?”
"narrow one in Harpe Alley, leading from Shoe Lane.  It was not an old"
"house, for it came within the area of the great fire of fifty years"
"back, and had been rebuilt, like the whole of the surrounding buildings,"
with greater speed than discretion.  Grey had once come across Sir
"Christopher Wren in his other life, and had talked with him of the"
short-sighted policy observed in the rebuilding of the city.  The great
"architect declared that had his plans been carried out, London would"
have been the finest city in the world: but the haste and false economy
"of the citizens and city companies had thwarted his plans, and the old"
"lines of narrow and crooked streets were kept as before, to the cost of"
succeeding generations.
"This house had been hastily run up, like those surrounding it, and the"
tempest from without rattled and shook the walls and windows as though
"to drive them in.  But the room itself, though no more than an attic,"
"bore an air of comfort very pleasant to the eyes of the homeless Grey,"
whose own quarters only contained the barest necessities of life; for
"there were some rough shelves full of books in one corner, and a rug"
before the fire gave a look of comfort to the place.  Two armchairs of
"rude pattern, but furnished with down cushions, seemed to invite repose;"
"and everything was scrupulously clean, even to the boards of the floor."
"""’A poor thing, but mine own,’"" spoke the Old Lion, with his grim smile,"
"as he motioned to Grey to take one chair, and he himself pulled up the"
"other. ""I have dwelt here two years and more now, and I have not been"
"unhappy; albeit I never thought to end my days in a garret, as belike I"
"shall do now."""
"""Fortune has been hard upon you,"" spoke Grey earnestly.  ""You have the"
gifts and the powers; it is cruel that your limbs should have become
"crippled."""
"I knew then, if never before, that there could be no happiness in this"
world for her away from him. Whether she would find it with him was
"impossible for me to know, but I saw that she was in the grip of a mighty"
"passion, and I could only hope that a way would open to save her."
Hamilton's fortunes would need to mend a great deal before he could
"or would ask her to be his wife, for now he was at the bottom of the"
ladder. He lost no opportunity to impress this disagreeable truth upon
"her, but his honest efforts to hold himself aloof only increased her"
respect and love for him. It not only convinced her that notwithstanding
"his past life, he was a man of honor capable of resisting himself and of"
"protecting her, but it gave him the quality so irresistible to a"
woman--unattainability.
"Taking it all in all, my poor beautiful cousin was falling day by"
day deeper into an abyss of love from which she could in no way
"extricate herself. In short, level-headed Frances had got far out"
"of plumb, and, though she struggled desperately, she could not right"
"herself, nor could any one help her. I fully realized that the small"
amount of self-restraint and passivity she still retained would give
way to disastrous activity when the time should come for her to part
with George and lose him forever. But I could see no way to save her
"unless I could induce George to leave England at once, for good and"
all.
"At times the fates seem to fly to a man's help, and in this instance they"
"came to me most graciously that same day in Whitehall, in the person of"
my friend the Count de Grammont.
"Soon after leaving Frances in the maids' apartments, I met that most"
"interesting gentleman roué, his Grace de Grammont, coming from the king's"
"closet. As already stated, he had been banished from the French court by"
"Generally the great park-gates stood hospitably open, and the little"
"town of San Ildefonso, with its lodgings and hostels, was at this season"
crowded with courtiers and hangers-on of the court. Guards circulated
"here and there, or clattered after the Queen-Regent as she drove out on"
the magnificent King's highway which stretched upwards over the
"Guadarrama towards Madrid, or whirled down towards Segovia and the"
plains of Old Castile. Bugles were never long silent in _plaza_ or
"barrack yard. Drums beat, fifes shrilled, and there was a continuous"
trampling of horses as this ambassador or that was escorted to the
"presence of Queen Cristina, widow of Fernando VII., mother of Isabel the"
"Second, and Regent of Spain."
"A word of historical introduction is here necessary, and it shall be but"
"a word. For nearly a quarter of a century Fernando, since he had been"
"restored to a forfeited throne by British bayonets, had acted on the"
ancient Bourbon principle of learning nothing and forgetting nothing.
"His tyrannies became ever more tyrannical, his exactions more shameless,"
his indolent arrogance more oppressive. Twice he had to invoke the aid
"of foreign troops, and once indeed a French army marched from one end of"
Spain to the other.
"But with the coming of his third wife, young Maria Cristina of Naples,"
all this was changed. Under her influence Fernando promptly became meek
and uxorious. Then he revoked the ordinance of a former King which
ordained that no woman should reign in Spain. He recalled his
"revocation, and again promulgated it according as his hope of offspring"
waxed or waned.
"Finally a daughter was born to the ill-mated pair, and Don Carlos, the"
"King's brother and former heir-apparent, left the country. Immediately"
upon the King's death civil war divided the state. The stricter
legitimists who stood for Don Carlos included the church generally and

"A few days ago we visited the Church of St. Laurence Without the Walls,"
"where in a silver shrine under the high altar, the remains of St."
Laurence and St. Stephen are said to rest. The walls of the portico of
"the church are covered with a series of frescoes, lately repainted. One"
series represents the story of St. Stephen and that of the translation
"of his relics to this church. ""The relics of St. Stephen were preserved"
"at Constantinople, whither they had been transported from Jerusalem by"
"the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius II. Hearing that her daughter,"
"Eudoxia, wife of Valentinian II., Emperor of the West, was afflicted"
"with a devil, she begged her to come to Constantinople, that her demon"
might be driven out by the touch of the relics. The younger Eudoxia
"wished to comply, but the devil refused to leave her unless St. Stephen"
was brought to Rome. An agreement was therefore made that the relics
of St. Stephen should be exchanged for those of St. Laurence. St.
"Stephen arrived, and the Empress was immediately relieved of her devil;"
but when the persons who had brought the relics of St. Stephen from
"Constantinople were about to take those of St. Laurence back with them,"
they all fell down dead! Pope Pelagius prayed for their restoration
"to life, which was granted for a short time, to prove the efficacy of"
"prayer, but they all died again ten days later! Thus the Romans knew"
"that it would be criminal to fulfil their promise, and part with the"
"relics of St. Laurence, and the bodies of the two martyrs were laid in"
"the same sarcophagus."" And thus we know how much more the Romans think"
"of relics than of honor and truth. ""It is related that when they opened"
"the sarcophagus, and lowered into it the body of St. Stephen, St."
"Laurence moved on one side, giving the place of honor on the right hand"
"to St. Stephen; hence, the common people of Rome have conferred on St."
"Laurence the title of '_Il cortese Spagnuolo_'--the courteous Spaniard."""
"not seem to remember, for he looked at them all, was silent and smiled"
... in a guilty way. Those men spoke very little to each other about
"their past, and they recalled it very seldom and then only its general"
"outlines.  When they did mention it, it was in a cynical tone."
"Probably, this was just as well, since, in many people, remembrance of"
the past kills all present energy and deadens all hope for the future.

"On rainy, cold, or dull days in the late autumn, these ""creatures that"
"once were men"" gathered in the eatinghouse of Vaviloff. They were well"
"known there, where some feared them as thieves and rogues, and some"
"looked upon them contemptuously as hard drinkers, although they"
"respected them, thinking that they were clever."
"The eating-house of Vaviloff was the club of the main street, and the"
"""creatures that once were men"" were its most intellectual members.  On"
"Saturday evenings or Sunday mornings, when the eating-house was packed,"
"the ""creatures that once were men"" were only too welcome guests.  They"
"brought with them, besides the forgotten and poverty-stricken"
"inhabitants of the street, their own spirit, in which there was"
something that brightened the lives of men exhausted and worn out in
"the struggle for existence, as great drunkards as the inhabitants of"
"Kuvalda's shelter, and, like them, outcasts from the town.  Their"
"ability to speak on all subjects, their freedom of opinion, skill in"
"repartee, courage in the presence of those of whom the whole street was"
"in terror, together with their daring demeanour, could not but be"
"pleasing to their companions.  Then, too, they were well versed in law,"
"and could advise, write petitions, and help to swindle without"
incurring the risk of punishment.  For all this they were paid with
vodki and flattering admiration of their talents.
Panama’s poor:

"Miguel lived on the banks of the Chagres River, about half way between"
Cruces and Alhajuela. To him Cruces was a city. Were there not at least
thirty huts of bamboo and clay thatched with palmetto like the one in
"which he lived? Was there not a church of sawn boards, with an altar to"
"which a priest came twice a month to say mass, and a school where a"
gringo taught the children strange things in the hated English tongue?
Where he lived there was no other hut within two or three hours poling
"up the river, but down at Cruces the houses were so close together you"
could almost reach one while sitting in the shade of another. At home
"after dark you only heard the cry of the whippoorwill, or occasionally"
"the wail of a tiger cat in the jungle, but at Cruces there was always"
"the loud talk of the men in the cantina, and a tom-tom dance at least"
"once a week, when everybody sat up till dawn dancing to the beat of the"
drums and drinking the good rum that made them all so jolly.
But greater than Cruces was the Yankee town of Matachin down on the
banks of the river where the crazy Americans said there was going to be
"a lake that some day would cover all the country, and drown out Cruces"
and even his father’s house. They were paying all the natives along the
"river for their lands that would be sunken, and the people were taking"
the pesos gladly and spending them gaily. They did not trouble to move
"away. Many years ago the French too said there would be a lake, but it"
never came and the French suddenly disappeared. The Americans would
"vanish the same way, and a good thing, too, for their thunderous noises"
"where they were working frightened away all the good game, and you could"
"hardly find an iguana, or a wild hog in a day’s hunting."

"pardoner, a 'pothecary and a pedlar, and for plot only a single"
"conversation, devoid even of the rough play which usually enlivened"
discussions on the stage. In the debate arises a contest as to who can
tell the biggest lie--won by the palmer's statement that he has never
seen a woman out of patience--and that is the sole dramatic element.
"Nevertheless, by sheer wit interest is maintained to the end, every one"
smiling over the rival claims of such veteran humbugs as the old-time
pardoner and apothecary; scant reverence does 'Pothecary vouchsafe to
"Pardoner's potent relics, his 'of All Hallows the blessed jaw-bone', his"
"'great toe of the Trinity', his 'buttock-bone of Pentecost', and the"
rest. One of the raciest passages occurs in the Pardoner's relation of
the wonders he has performed in the execution of his office. Amongst
other deeds of note is the bringing back of a certain woman from hell to
earth. For this purpose the Pardoner visited the lower regions in
person--so he says--and brought her out in triumph with the full and
joyful consent of Lucifer.
[_The_ PARDONER _has entered hell and secured a guide._]
_Pardoner._ This devil and I walked arm in arm
"So far, till he had brought me thither,"
Where all the devils of hell together
Stood in array in such apparel
As for that day there meetly fell.
"Their horns well-gilt, their claws full clean,"
"Their tails well-kempt, and, as I ween,"
With sothery[48] butter their bodies anointed;
I never saw devils so well appointed.
"The master-devil sat in his jacket,"
And all the souls were playing at racket.
"None other rackets they had in hand,"
"Save every soul a good firebrand,"
"""And I,"" retorted Concha, ""am as strictly forbidden to reveal mine to"
"General Cabrera or even to that notable young officer, Colonel Don Rollo"
"of the surname which resembles so much a _borrico's_ serenade!"""
That speech would have been undoubtedly rude save for the glance which
"accompanied it, given softly yet daringly from beneath a jetty fringe of"
eyelash.
Nevertheless all Rollo Blair's pride of ancestry rose insurgent within
him. Who was this Andalucian waiting-maid that she should speak lightly
of the descendant of that Blair of Blair Castle who had stood for Bruce
"and freedom on the field of Bannockburn? It was unbearable--and yet,"
"well, there was something uncommon about this girl. And after all, was"
it not the mark of a gentleman to pay no heed to the babbling of women's
"tongues? If they did not say one thing, they would another. Besides, he"
cared nothing what this girl might say. A parrot prattling in a cage
would affect him as much.
So they rode on together over the great tawny brick-dusty wastes of Old
"Castile, silent mostly, but the silence occasionally broken by speech,"
"friendly enough on either side. Behind them pounded La Giralda, gaunt as"
"the sergeant himself, leather-legginged, booted and spurred, watching"
"them keenly out of her ancient, unfathomable gipsy eyes."
And ever as they rode the Guadarrama mountains rose higher and whiter
"out of the vast and hideous plain, the only interruption to the circling"
horizon of brown and parched corn lands. But at this season scrub-oak
"and juniper were the only shrubs to be seen, and had there been a"
"Cristino outpost anywhere within miles, the party must have been"
discerned riding steadily towards the northern slopes of the mountains.
"But neither man nor beast took notice of them, and a certain large"
uncanny silence brooded over the plain.
"Marsh's full, red lips went pallid with rage as he said ""Then it is to"
"be war, eh?"""
"""Suit yourself."" Boyd pointed to the shore. ""Your boatman is waiting"
"for you."""
As Marsh made his way to the water's edge he stumbled like a blind man;
"his lips were bleeding where his small, sharp teeth had bitten them,"
and he panted like an hysterical woman.
"During the next fortnight the sailing-ships began to assemble, standing"
in under a great spread of canvas to berth close alongside the two
"steamships; for, once the ice had moved north, there was no further"
"obstacle to their coming, and the harbor was soon livened with puffing"
"tugs, unwieldy lighters, and fleets of smaller vessels. Where, but a"
"short time before, the brooding silence had been undisturbed save for"
"the plaint of wolf-dogs and the lazy voices of natives, a noisy army"
was now at work. The bustle of a great preparation arose; languid
smoke-wreaths began to unfurl above the stacks of the canneries; the
stamp and clank of tin-machines re-echoed; hammer and saw maintained a
never-ceasing hubbub. Down at the new plant scows were being launched
while yet the pitch was warm on their seams; buildings were rising
"rapidly, and a crew had gone up the river to get out a raft of piles."
"On the morning after the arrival of the last ship, Emerson and his"
companions were treated to a genuine surprise. Cherry had come down to
the site as usual--she could not let a day go by without visiting the
"place--and Clyde, after a tardy breakfast, had just come ashore. They"
"were watching Big George direct the launching of a scow, when all of a"
"sudden they heard a familiar voice behind them cry, cheerfully:"
"performed. Appendix incision, about [Symbol: ounce]j of fæcal"
fluid and fæces in a localised cavity on outer and anterior
aspect of cæcum evacuated; adhesions very firm. Cavity sloughy
throughout and cæcum covered with dull grey lymph. The opening
"in the bowel was not localised, and it was considered wiser to"
treat the case like one of perforation from appendicitis than
to run the risk of breaking down adhesions. A small awl-like
opening was found in the ilium with powdered bone at its
entrance leading to the wound of exit.
"The after-treatment of the case gave rise to no anxiety, but"
healing of the resulting sinus was slow; fæcal-smelling pus
"escaped for some days, and a number of small sloughs came away."
"On the twelfth day the patient was sent down to Wynberg, where"
he remained twelve weeks. A counter-incision was needed in the
loin to drain the suppurating cavity three weeks after the
"primary operation, and five weeks after the operation an escape"
"of gas and fæces took place from the anterior wound, while the"
"bowels were acting, as a result of a dose of castor oil. No"
"further escape of fæces occurred, and he left for England with"
a small sinus only. No extension of inflammation into the
"original wound track ever occurred, both openings and the canal"
healing by primary union.
"The sinus remained open, and occasionally discharged for a"
"further period of six months, and then healed firmly; since"
when the patient has been in perfect health.

"Magersfontein. _Entry_ (Mauser), in sixth left intercostal"
"space in mid-axillary line; _exit_, in left loin, below last"
"rib, at outer margin of erector spinæ. The patient remained in"
"dined quite cheerfully on dry bread and water, if any one would have"
listened to his stories of the wonders of his past life or the yet more
wonderful achievements of his future. He would have sat and spun yarns
"concerning the notches on Killiecrankie at a dyke-back, though he had"
"not tasted food for twenty-four hours, with the utmost composure and"
"relish. But his companions were of another kidney, being all valiant"
"trencher-men--John Mortimer desiring chiefly quantity in his eating,"
"while Etienne, no mean cook himself, desiderated rather variety and"
delicacy in the dishes which were set before him.
"At all events the dinner was a great success, though the Sergeant, who"
"evinced the greatest partiality for Rollo, often reproached him with"
"eating little, or inquired anxiously if the sauce of a certain dish"
"were not to his taste. Rollo, in the height of his argument, would"
"hastily affirm that it was delicious, and be off again in chase of some"
"deed of arms or daring, leaving the Sergeant's _chef-d'oeuvre_"
untasted on his plate.
At this the Sergeant shook his head in private to El Sarria.
"""It will stand in his way, I fear me,"" he said sententiously; ""was there"
ever a notable general yet who had not a fine belly to wag before him
upon horseback? 'Tis as necessary as the cock's feathers in his hat. Now
there is your cut-and-thrust officer who is good for nothing but to be
first in charges and to lead forlorn hopes--this colonel of yours is
just the figure for him. I have seen many a dozen of them get the lead
between their ribs and never regretted it before. But it is a devil's
pity that this young cockerel is not fonder of his dinner. How regardeth
"he the women?"""
"This last question was asked anxiously, yet with some hope. But this"
also El Sarria promptly scattered to the winds.
"supply of granite, gneiss, marble, slate, and other such building"
materials. Still more valuable are the stores of iron and copper
and other metals which they contain.
At the present time the pre-Cambrian region about Lake Superior
"leads the world in the production of iron ore, its output for 1903"
being more than five sevenths of the entire output of the whole
"United States, and exceeding that of any foreign country. The ore"
bodies consist chiefly of the red oxide of iron (hematite) and
"occur in troughs of the strata, underlain by some impervious rock."
A theory held by many refers the ultimate source of the iron to
the igneous rocks of the Archean. When these rocks were upheaved
"and subjected to weathering, their iron compounds were decomposed."
Their iron was leached out and carried away to be laid in the
Algonkian water bodies in beds of iron carbonate and other iron
"compounds. During the later ages, after the Algonkian strata had"
"been uplifted to form part of the continent, a second"
concentration has taken place. Descending underground waters
charged with oxygen have decomposed the iron carbonate and
"deposited the iron, in the form of iron oxide, in troughs of the"
strata where their downward progress was arrested by impervious
floors.
The pre-Cambrian rocks of the eastern United States also are rich
"in iron. In certain districts, as in the Highlands of New Jersey,"
the black oxide of iron (magnetite) is so abundant in beds and
disseminated grains that the ordinary surveyor's compass is
useless.
The pre-Cambrian copper mines of the Lake Superior region are
"among the richest on the globe. In the igneous rocks copper, next"
"to iron, is the most common of all the useful metals, and it was"
"Viggon Sarri smiled confidently. He glanced at Linus Brein and asked,"
"""Just how competent do you think this new thing is?"""
"Linus shrugged. ""We've analyzed the infrawave pattern they've"
developed. It is obvious that this is their first prototype of an
infrawave space detector. The pattern is of the primitive absorptive
"type, which is both inefficient as a detector and is also inclined to"
"produce spurious responses. From our observations, their equipment"
must be extremely complex too. It must be loaded to the scuppers with
"fragile circuits and components, because the search pattern keeps"
"breaking down, or becoming irregular. An efficient detector cannot"
be made of the infrawave bands until the third order of reflective
"response is discovered. I doubt that any research team, no matter how"
"big, can start with the primitive absorption phase of the infrawaves"
and leap to the higher orders of infrawave radiation in less than a
"lifetime of study."""
"""So, gentlemen?"" asked Viggon of his two aides. ""Can you predict"
"whether or not their new detector will deliver the goods?"""
All looked expectantly at Linus Brein.
"""We've been recalculating our probabilities at the introduction of each"
"new phase of their behaviour,"" Linus Brein said seriously. ""From their"
"actions, I would say that they do not know, grasp, or perhaps even"
guess that space has flaws and warps in the continuum. They have been
"going at their search in a pattern of solid geometrical precision, but"
"have been paying no attention to those rifts, small as they are, that"
actually make a straight course bend aside for a distance. So due to
the fact that their search pattern has already passed over one of these
"rifts in which the one lifeship lies, and passed beyond in their line"
"Then followed a lean and bony man of whom no one knew anything, with a"
"frightened expression in his eyes, the left one of which had a squint."
"He was silent and timid, and had been imprisoned three times for theft"
by the High Court of Justice and the Magisterial Courts.  His family
"name was Kiselnikoff, but they called him Paltara Taras, because he was"
"a head and shoulders taller than his friend, Deacon Taras, who had been"
degraded from his office for drunkenness and immorality.  The Deacon
"was a short, thick-set person, with the chest of an athlete and a"
"round, strong head.  He danced skilfully, and was still more skilful at"
swearing.  He and Paltara Taras worked in the wood on the banks of the
"river, and in free hours he told his friend or any one who would"
"listen, ""Tales of my own composition,"" as he used to say.  On hearing"
"these stories, the heroes of which always seemed to be saints, kings,"
"priests, or generals, even the inmates of the dosshouse spat and rubbed"
"their eyes in astonishment at the imagination of the Deacon, who told"
"them shameless tales of lewd, fantastic adventures, with blinking eyes"
and a passionless expression of countenance.  The imagination of this
man was powerful and inexhaustible; he could go on relating and
"composing all day, from morning to night, without once repeating what"
he had said before.  In his expression you sometimes saw the poet gone
"astray, sometimes the romancer, and he always succeeded in making his"
tales realistic by the effective and powerful words in which he told
them.
There was also a foolish young man called Kuvalda Meteor.  One night he
came to sleep in the dosshouse and had remained ever since among these
"men, much to their astonishment.  At first they did not take much"
"notice of him.  In the daytime, like all the others, he went away to"
"find something to eat, but at nights he always loitered around this"
friendly company till at last the Captain took notice of him.
"""Boy!  What business have you here on this earth?"""
"his nose, completed Mephisto's brief spell of unalloyed liberty."
Temporarily stunned by the terrific concussion the monkey relaxed his
grip and fell.
"Just at that moment the staff-paymaster, who was scurrying below with"
"one of the pay-trays, happened to be passing in the direct line of"
Mephisto's descent. The next instant the portly officer was rolling
on the deck in a puddle of condensed milk with the monkey's paws
"clutching at his scanty crop of hair, while to complete the"
staff-paymaster's discomfiture most of the money he was carrying
rolled overboard.
Regaining his feet Staff-paymaster Staggles contrived to reach the
"companion, and with Mephisto still firmly attached to him,"
disappeared below.
But the men's attention was now directed towards more serious
matters. An ever-diverging line that rippled the placid water denoted
the approach of a deadly torpedo. Now it was heading as if about to
"hit the bows of the ""Sunderland,"" a second later and the arrow-like"
"ripples seemed to be approaching directly abeam; then, as the cruiser"
swung almost on her heel the wake of the formidable missile was
merged into the churning froth astern. It had missed by a bare yard.
From the fire-control platform telephone bells were clanging and men
shouting through the voice-tubes. From their elevated position the
"watchers could discern a long, dark shadow that marked the position"
of the submarine.
"Completely circling the ""Sunderland"" was steadied on her helm and"
steered straight for the spot. In vain the submerged craft attempted
to dive to a depth greater than that of her enemy's draught.
stricken farmhouse. But only La Giralda gave a thought to the little
"grave in the shady corner of the garden, and only she promised herself"
to revisit it when the stern work of the night should be over and the
dawn of a calmer morning should have arisen.
"Now, as soon as Sergeant Cardono returned, he placed himself as"
completely as formerly under the orders of Rollo. He was no more José
"Maria the famous gipsy, but Sergeant Cardono of the army of H.M. Carlos"
"Quinto, and Señor Rollo was his colonel. Like a good scout he was ready"
"to advise, but to the full as ready to hold his tongue and obey."
"And Rollo, though new to his position, was not above benefiting"
"continually by his wisdom, and as a matter of fact it was the Sergeant"
"who, in conjunction with La Giralda, led the little expedition down the"
perilous goat-track by which the old gipsy had followed her flock in the
"morning. As usual Concha kept her place beside Rollo, with Mortimer and"
"Etienne a little behind, while El Sarria, taciturn but alert as usual,"
brought up the rear.
It can hardly be said that they carried with them any extraordinary
"elements of success. Indeed, in one respect they were at a manifest"
disadvantage. For in an expedition of this kind there ought to be one
"leader of dignity, character, and military genius far beyond the others."
But among this little band which stole so quietly along the
"mountain-paths of the Guadarrama, beneath the frowning snow-clad brow of"
"Peñalara, there was not one who upon occasion could not have led a"
similar forlorn hope. Each member of the party possessed a character
definite and easily to be distinguished from all the others. It was an
army of officers without any privates.
"Still, since our Firebrand, Rollo the Scot, held the nominal leadership,"
"and his quick imperious character made that chieftainship a reality,"
facing these two villages. But the specimens found in Sanaroa are
"much better in colour, and I think more easily procured. The fishing"
"in this latter locality, however, is done by the Sinaketans only."
"Whether the fishing is done in their own Lagoon, near an uninhabited"
"island called Nanoula, or in Sanaroa, it is always a big, ceremonial"
"affair, in which the whole community takes part in a body. The"
"magic, or at least part of it, is done for the whole community by"
"the magician of the kaloma (towosina kaloma), who also fixes the"
"dates, and conducts the ceremonial part of the proceedings. As the"
spondylus shell furnishes one of the essential episodes of a Kula
"expedition, a detailed account both of fishing and of manufacturing"
"must be here given. The native name, kaloma (in the Southern Massim"
districts the word sapi-sapi is used) describes both the shell and
"the manufactured discs. The shell is the large spondylus shell,"
"containing a crystalline layer of a red colour, varying from dirty"
"brick-red to a soft, raspberry pink, the latter being by far the most"
"prized. It lives in the cavities of coral outcrop, scattered among"
shallow mud-bottomed lagoons.
"This shell is, according to tradition, associated with the village"
"of Sinaketa. According to a Sinaketan legend, once upon a time, three"
"guya'u (chief) women, belonging to the Tabalu sub-clan of the Malasi"
"clan, wandered along, each choosing her place to settle in. The eldest"
selected the village of Omarakana; the second went to Gumilababa;
"the youngest settled in Sinaketa. She had kaloma discs in her basket,"
"and they were threaded on a long, thin stick, called viduna, such"
as is used in the final stage of manufacture. She remained first
"in a place called Kaybwa'u, but a dog howled, and she moved further"
"on. She heard again a dog howling, and she took a kaboma (wooden plate)"
and went on to the fringing reef to collect shells. She found there
"the momoka (white spondylus), and she exclaimed: ""Oh, this is the"
placed--a point in the argument which left an opportunity open to Kant
"to suggest a new development, to ask whether things being found"
"inadequate in producing knowledge, we might not ask if knowledge could"
not be more successful with things. But it is the Scottish lines of
"attempted solution that we wish to follow out, and not the German."
Perhaps they are not so very different.
"Philosophy, as Reid found it, was in a bad way enough, as far as the"
orthodox mind of Scotland was concerned. All justification for belief
"in God, in immortality, in all that was held sacred in a century of"
"much orthodoxy if little zeal, was gone. Such things might be believed"
"in by those who found any comfort in so believing, but to the educated"
"man who had seriously reflected on them, they were anachronisms. The"
"very desperateness of the case, however, seemed to promise a remedy."
"Men could not rest in a state of permanent scepticism, in a world"
utterly incapable of being rationally explained. Even the propounder of
"the theories allowed this to be true; and as for others, they felt that"
"they were rational beings, and this signified that there was system in"
the world.
"A champion arose when things were at their worst in Thomas Reid, the"
"founder, or at least the chiefest ornament, of the so-called Scottish"
School of Philosophy. He it was who set himself to add the principle of
"the coherence of the Universe, and the consequent possibility of"
"establishing Faith once more in the world. Reid, to begin with, instead"
"of looking at Hume's results as serious, regarded them as necessarily"
"absurd. He started a new theory of his own, the theory of Immediate"
"Perception, which signified that we are able immediately to"
"apprehend--not ideas only, but the Truth. And how, we may ask, can this"
be done?
It had been pointed out first of all that sensations as understood by
better than dogma--Erasmus's talent and wit--Delight in words
and things--Prolixity--Observation of details--A veiled
realism--Ambiguousness--The 'Nuance'--Inscrutability of the
ultimate ground of all things
"Simplicity, naturalness, purity, and reasonableness, those are to"
"Erasmus the dominant requirements, also when we pass from his ethical"
"and aesthetic concepts to his intellectual point of view; indeed, the"
two can hardly be kept apart.
"The world, says Erasmus, is overloaded with human constitutions and"
"opinions and scholastic dogmas, and overburdened with the tyrannical"
"authority of orders, and because of all this the strength of gospel"
"doctrine is flagging. Faith requires simplification, he argued. What"
would the Turks say of our scholasticism? Colet wrote to him one day:
"'There is no end to books and science. Let us, therefore, leave all"
roundabout roads and go by a short cut to the truth.'
"Truth must be simple. 'The language of truth is simple, says Seneca;"
"well then, nothing is simpler nor truer than Christ.' 'I should wish',"
"Erasmus says elsewhere, 'that this simple and pure Christ might be"
"deeply impressed upon the mind of men, and that I deem best attainable"
"in this way, that we, supported by our knowledge of the original"
"languages, should philosophize _at the sources_ themselves.'"
Here a new watchword comes to the fore: back to the sources! It is not
"merely an intellectual, philological requirement; it is equally an"
"ethical and aesthetic necessity of life. The original and pure, all that"
"is not yet overgrown or has not passed through many hands, has such a"
potent charm. Erasmus compared it to an apple which we ourselves pick
"off the tree. To recall the world to the ancient simplicity of science,"
"Petrol was, at the moment, the most important of our needs; we had,"
"therefore, to carry with us all we should require, making allowance"
"at the same time for mishaps. Moreover, we had to take enough food"
"and water to last Allan, Allah-dad and myself for five or six days."
"As regards personal luggage we travelled absolutely light, leaving"
"all kit to follow at a slower pace on camels, together with my horse,"
"Galahad. I had some compunction in leaving the latter behind, but my"
"orders were concise and urgent--to reach Robat, endeavour to get into"
"touch with all our scattered posts, and effect a combination against"
the Raiders at the earliest possible moment.
"A start was made very early in the morning, but the first day's"
journey proved disappointing. Instead of doing the ninety miles
"planned, we only accomplished thirty. The track was even worse than I"
"had expected, for we constantly ran into sand-hills, and had to dig"
the car out. I have never done so much digging in my life as I did on
"that journey to Robat. Sand-hills were, however, only a portion of"
"our afflictions, for, in addition, there were many water pools and"
small shallow lakes--due to recent rain--which had to be taken at a
"rush, or somehow circumvented."
"So serious, at last, did our rate of progress become that, as we"
"approached what seemed to be the hundredth of these wide, shallow"
"pools, I lost patience and ordered Allan to drive straight through."
"He attempted to carry out the order, but about half-way we sank up"
to the axle and stuck. No power on earth would induce the car to
"budge another inch, and, though we all three got out into the water,"
"and lugged, pushed and dragged at the wretched car, no impression"
could be made upon her.
policy of emperor and pope. People wanted to use his name and make him
choose sides. And that he would not do for any consideration. He wrote
evasively to the Pope about his relations with Luther without altogether
disavowing him. How zealously he defends himself from the suspicion of
"being on Luther's side as noisy monks make out in their sermons, who"
summarily link the two in their scoffing disparagement.
But by the other side also he is pressed to choose sides and to speak
out. Towards the end of October 1520 the coronation of the emperor took
place at Aix-la-Chapelle. Erasmus was perhaps present; in any case he
"accompanied the Emperor to Cologne. There, on 5 November, he had an"
interview about Luther with the Elector Frederick of Saxony. He was
persuaded to write down the result of that discussion in the form of
twenty-two _Axiomata concerning Luther's cause_. Against his intention
they were printed at once.
Erasmus's hesitation in those days between the repudiation and the
approbation of Luther is not discreditable to him. It is the tragic
defect running through his whole personality: his refusal or inability
ever to draw ultimate conclusions. Had he only been a calculating and
"selfish nature, afraid of losing his life, he would long since have"
altogether forsaken Luther's cause. It is his misfortune affecting his
"fame, that he continually shows his weaknesses, whereas what is great in"
him lies deep.
"At Cologne Erasmus also met the man with whom, as a promising young"
"humanist, fourteen years younger than himself, he had, for some months,"
"shared a room in the house of Aldus's father-in-law, at Venice:"
"Hieronymus Aleander, now sent to the Emperor as a papal nuncio, to"
"persuade him to conform his imperial policy to that of the Pope, in the"
"matter of the great ecclesiastical question, and give effect to the"
papal excommunication by the imperial ban.
"a dogma of the most tremendous kind, and an undogmatic Creed is"
as senseless as a statue without shape or a picture without
colour. Unsectarian means un-Christian.“--From _Freethinking
"and Plainspeaking_ (pp. 122-4), by Leslie Stephen. (Longmans,"
London.)
The considerations which seemed to compel the clearheaded author of
this extract to his own well-known intellectual position no longer
"apply. In England, at any rate, the Church is not bound down to any"
"mechanical theory of the inspiration of the Bible, and accepts all the"
discoveries of Modern Physical Science without misgiving. Such books
as the late Archbishop of Canterbury (Dr. Temple) gave us in his
Bampton Lectures have long ago shown the futility of attempting to map
out the exact terms of a reconciliation between the claims of science
"and religion, but they have shown that religion and science are _not_"
destructive and contradictory of each other.
"“The same principles are found in each. The principle of evolution,"
"for instance, is as evident in the gradual development of religion as"
in the age-long process by which the natural world was created; the
order and beauty and regular succession manifest in Nature can be
traced also in the spiritual universe. The revelation which was
formerly held to be violation of law is seen to be a revelation of
"higher law. The great postulate of science, the uniformity of Nature,"
is not infringed.”
"We know now that there are laws of the Universe which, if we knew more"
"about them, would tell us how it was that a Virgin could conceive and"
bear a Son. It is not to us an inconceivable superstition that “The
Son of Man” should have in His own person powers of which the
"rudimentary signs can be traced in all humanity, manifesting"
themselves from time to time. The day is long past when the
imagination by linking her life finally with his?--It is a perfectly
simple explanation of what some credulous souls might be inclined to
"consider a mystery,--and let the dear, wise, oracular people who cannot"
"admit any mystery in anything, and who love to trace all seeming"
"miracles to clever imposture, accept this elucidation by all"
"means,--they will be able to fit every incident of the story into such"
"an hypothesis, with most admirable and consecutive neatness! Al-Kyris"
"was truly a Vision,--the rest was,--What? Merely the working of a"
poetic imagination under mesmeric influence!
"So be it! The Poet knows the truth,--but what are Poets? Only the"
"Prophets and Seers! Only the Eyes of Time, which clearly behold"
"Heaven's Fact beyond this world's Fable. Let them sing if they choose,"
"and we will hear them in our idle hours,--we will give them a little of"
"our gold,--a little of our grudging praise, together with much of our"
private practical contempt and misprisal! So say the unthinking and
"foolish--so will they ever say,--and hence it is, that though the fame"
"of Theos Alwyn widens year by year, and his sweet clarion harp of Song"
"rings loud warning, promise, hope, and consolation above the noisy"
"tumult of the whirling age, people listen to him merely in vague"
"wonderment and awe, doubting his prophet utterance, and loth to put"
"away their sin. But he, never weary in well-doing, works on, ... ever"
"regardless of Self, caring nothing for Fame, but giving all the riches"
"of his thought for Love. Clear, grand, pure, and musical, his writings"
"fill the time with hope and passionate faith and courage,--his"
"inspiration fails not, and can never fail, since Edris is his fount of"
"ecstasy,--his name, made glorious by God's blessing, shall never, as in"
"his perished Past, be again forgotten!"
"And what of Edris? What of the ""Flower-crowned Wonder"" of the Field of"
"Ardath, strayed for a while out of her native Heaven? Does the world"
"know her marvellous origin? Perhaps the mystic Heliobas knows,--perhaps"
the project was never abandoned during four hundred years. At last it
"was secured by stratagem, in the year eight hundred and something."
"The commander of the Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the"
"bones, separated them, and packed them in vessels filled with lard. The"
religion of Mahomet causes its devotees to abhor anything in the nature
"of pork, and so when the Christian was stopped at the gate of the city,"
"they only glanced once into the precious baskets, then turned up their"
"noses at the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones were buried in"
"the vaults of the grand cathedral, which had been waiting long years"
"to receive them, and thus the safety and the greatness of Venice were"
secured. And to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if
"those holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would vanish like a"
"dream, and its foundation be buried forever in the unremembering sea."""
[Sidenote: The Gift of Leo XIII. to London.]
More recently I had read of what has been well called the burlesque
"enacted at Arundel Castle no longer ago than in July, 1902, in which"
"the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Vaughan, and many lesser ornaments and"
"dignitaries of the Romish Church, took part."
"""Pope Leo XIII., in order to show his 'good-will to England,'"
sent from Rome the remains of St. Edmund to garnish the new Roman
"Catholic cathedral at Westminster. It was an appropriate gift, for"
such buildings are usually garnished with 'dead men's bones and all
"uncleanness.' But as the cathedral is not yet finished, as a further"
"token of good-will, the relics were committed to the care of no less"
a personage than the Earl Marshal of England. They arrived at Arundel
"on the evening of July 25th, and were placed for the night in Fitzalen"
"Chapel. The next morning the whole castle was astir betimes, for the"
"great event of the day, the transference of the bones to the castle"
"chapel, was to take place. This was accomplished in a solemn and"
"PHILLIPS, JOHN."
"A carpenter by trade, he sailed from the West Country for Newfoundland in"
a ship that was captured by the pirate Anstis in the _Good Fortune_.
"Phillips soon became reconciled to the life of a pirate, and, being a"
"brisk fellow, he was appointed carpenter to the ship. Returning to England"
"he soon found it necessary to quit the country again, and he shipped"
himself on board a vessel at Topsham for Newfoundland. On arriving at
"Peter Harbour he ran away, and hired himself as a splitter to the"
Newfoundland cod fishery.
"On the night of August 29th, 1723, with four others, he stole a vessel in"
the harbour and sailed away. Phillips was chosen captain. Articles were
"now drawn up and were sworn to upon a hatchet, because no Bible could be"
"found on board. Amongst other laws was the punishment of ""40 stripes"
"lacking one, known as Moses's law, to be afflicted for striking a"
"fellow-pirate."" The last law of the nine casts a curious light on these"
"murderers; it runs: ""If at any time you meet with a prudent Woman, that"
"Man that offers to meddle with her, without her Consent, shall suffer"
"present Death."" The pirates, fortified by these laws, met with instant"
"success, taking several fishing vessels, from which they augmented their"
small crew by the addition of several likely and brisk seamen. Amongst
these they had the good fortune to take prisoner an old pirate called John
"Rose Archer, who had served his pirate apprenticeship under the able"
"tuition of the famous Blackbeard, and who they at once promoted to be"
"quartermaster. This quick promotion caused trouble afterwards, for some of"
"the original crew, particularly carpenter Fern, resented it. The pirates"
"next sailed to Barbadoes, that happy hunting ground, but for three months"
"never a sail did they meet with, so that they were almost starving for"
"want of provisions, being reduced to a pound of dried meat a day amongst"
"in the intellectual life of a Nation, that of spontaneous outflow, that"
giving out of its life by which the world is enriched. When the Nation
"has lost this power, when it merely receives, but cannot give out, then"
"its healthy life is over, and it sinks into a degenerate existence which"
is purely parasitic.
HOW INDIA CAN TEACH
"How can our Nation give out of the fulness of the life that is in it,"
and how can a new Indian University help in the realisation of this
object? It is clear that its power of directing and inspiring will
depend on its world status. This can be secured to it by no artificial
"means, nor by any strength in the past; and what is the weakness that"
has been paralysing her activities for the accomplishment of any great
"scientific work? There must be two different elements, and these must be"
evenly balanced. Any excess of either will injure it.
HOW TO SECURE THIS STATUS
This world status can only be won by the intrinsic value of the great
contributions to be made by its own Indian scholars for the advancement
of the world's knowledge. To be organic and vital our new University
"must stand primarily for self-expression, and for winning for India a"
place she has lost. Knowledge is never the exclusive possession of any
"particular race, nor does it recognise geographical limitations. The"
"whole world is interdependent, and a constant stream of thought had been"
carried out throughout the ages enriching the common heritage of
mankind. Although science was neither of the East nor of the West but
"international, certain aspects of it gained richness by reason of their"
place of origin.
This table shows in its second column the prices paid by the
"Sinaketans to the industrial villages of Kuboma, a district in the"
Northern Trobriands. In the third column what they receive in Dobu
"is recorded. The table has been obtained from a Sinaketan informant,"
"and it probably is far from accurate, and the transactions are sure"
"to vary greatly in the gain which they afford. There is no doubt,"
"however, that for each article, the Sinaketan would ask the price"
which he paid for them as well as some extra article.
Thus we see that there is in this transaction a definite gain obtained
by the middlemen. The natives of Sinaketa act as intermediaries
"between the industrial centres of the Trobriands and Dobu, whereas"
their hosts play the same rôle between the Sinaketans and the men
from the outlying districts.
"Besides trading and obtaining of Kula valuables, the natives of"
"Sinaketa visit their friends and their distant relatives, who, as we"
"saw before, are to be found in this district owing to migrations. The"
"visitors walk across the flat, fertile plain from one hamlet to the"
"other, enjoying some of the marvellous and unknown sights of this"
"district. They are shown the hot springs of Numanuma and of Deyde'i,"
"which are in constant eruption. Every few minutes, the water boils up"
"in one spring after another of each group, throwing up jets of spray"
"a few metres high. The plain around these springs is barren, with"
nothing but here and there a stunted kind of eucalyptus tree. This
is the only place in the whole of Eastern New Guinea where as far
"as I know, eucalyptus trees are to be found. This was at least the"
"information of some intelligent natives, in whose company I visited"
"the springs, and who had travelled all over the Eastern islands and"
the East end of the mainland.
"The land-locked bays and lagoons, the Northern end of Dawson Strait,"
self. I’m just a little bit glad that you slipped on the ice.”
"When the two were established at a well-appointed table, with a"
"promising waiter hovering in attendance, Chandler began to experience"
the real joy that his regular outing always brought to him.
The restaurant was not so showy or pretentious as the one further down
"Broadway, which he always preferred, but it was nearly so. The tables"
"were well filled with prosperous-looking diners, there was a good"
"orchestra, playing softly enough to make conversation a possible"
"pleasure, and the cuisine and service were beyond criticism. His"
"companion, even in her cheap hat and dress, held herself with an air"
that added distinction to the natural beauty of her face and figure.
"And it is certain that she looked at Chandler, with his animated but"
"self-possessed manner and his kindling and frank blue eyes, with"
something not far from admiration in her own charming face.
"Then it was that the Madness of Manhattan, the frenzy of Fuss and"
"Feathers, the Bacillus of Brag, the Provincial Plague of Pose seized"
"upon Towers Chandler. He was on Broadway, surrounded by pomp and style,"
and there were eyes to look at him. On the stage of that comedy he had
assumed to play the one-night part of a butterfly of fashion and an
"idler of means and taste. He was dressed for the part, and all his good"
angels had not the power to prevent him from acting it.
"So he began to prate to Miss Marian of clubs, of teas, of golf and"
riding and kennels and cotillions and tours abroad and threw out hints
of a yacht lying at Larchmont. He could see that she was vastly
"impressed by this vague talk, so he endorsed his pose by random"
"insinuations concerning great wealth, and mentioned familiarly a few"
names that are handled reverently by the proletariat. It was Chandler’s
"short little day, and he was wringing from it the best that could be"
the insecurity deter him. In England the servitude which was required of
"him there revolted him. But in the Netherlands themselves, he did not"
"feel at his ease, either: 'Here I am barked at a great deal, and there"
"is no remuneration; though I desired it ever so much, I could not bear"
to stay there long'. Yet he remained for four years.
Erasmus had good friends in the University of Louvain. At first he put
"up with his old host Johannes Paludanus, Rhetor of the University, whose"
house he exchanged that summer for quarters in the College of the Lily.
"Martin Dorp, a Dutchman like himself, had not been estranged from him by"
their polemics about the _Moria_; his good will was of great importance
"to Erasmus, because of the important place Dorp occupied in the"
"theological faculty. And lastly, though his old patron, Adrian of"
"Utrecht, afterwards Pope, had by that time been called away from Louvain"
"to higher dignities, his influence had not diminished in consequence,"
but rather increased; for just about that time he had been made a
cardinal.
Erasmus was received with great complaisance by the Louvain divines.
"Their leader, the vice-chancellor of the University, Jean Briard of Ath,"
"repeatedly expressed his approval of the edition of the New Testament,"
to Erasmus's great satisfaction. Soon Erasmus found himself a member of
the theological faculty. Yet he did not feel at his ease among the
Louvain theologians. The atmosphere was a great deal less congenial to
him than that of the world of the English scholars. Here he felt a
spirit which he did not understand and distrusted in consequence.
"In the years in which the Reformation began, Erasmus was the victim of a"
"great misunderstanding, the result of the fact that his delicate,"
"aesthetic, hovering spirit understood neither the profoundest depths of"
the faith nor the hard necessities of human society. He was neither
mystic nor realist. Luther was both. To Erasmus the great problem of
"once we are to renounce our reason, or trust to it only within a"
"certain sphere, all hope for us is lost, as far as withstanding the"
attack of outside enemies is concerned. We are liable to sceptical
"attacks from every side, and all we can maintain against them is a"
"personal conviction which is not proof. How, then, was the difficulty"
met?
[6] _Philosophy of the Unconditioned_ (Sir William
"Hamilton), p. 15."
"Kant, as we have said, made an important development upon the position"
of Hume. Hume had arrived at the point of declaring the particular mind
and matter equally incompetent to afford an ultimate explanation of
"things, and he suggested experience in their place. This is the first"
"note of the new philosophy: experience, not a process of the"
"interaction of two separate things, mind on the one hand, matter on the"
"other, but something comprehending both. This, however, was scarcely"
"realised either by Hume or Kant, though the latter came very near the"
"formulation of it. Kant saw, at least, that things could not produce"
"knowledge, and he therefore changed his front and suggested starting"
with the knowledge that was before regarded as result--a change in
point of view that caused a revolution in thought similar to that
caused in our ideas of the natural world by the introduction of the
"system of Copernicus. Still, while following out his Copernican theory,"
Kant did not go far enough. His methods were still somewhat
psychological in nature. He still regarded thought as something which
can be separated from the thinker; he still maintained the existence of
things in themselves independent and outside of thought. He gives us a
"'theory' of knowledge, when what we want to reach is knowledge itself,"
and not a subjective conception of it.
Here it is that the Absolute Idealism comes in--the Idealism most
"Unusual words, proper names, and figures should be written out with the"
greatest care and distinctness by the author.
"It is for the common advantage of the author, the publisher, and the"
printer that the author or the editor read all proofs promptly.
ESTIMATING THE MANUSCRIPT
The usual procedure in making a book is as follows: When the publisher
"sends the manuscript to the printer, a request goes with it for a"
"sample page, set to a size and in a type which will make a volume of"
the desired number of pages. A novel is supposed to run from 320 pages
to 400 pages. The first thing to be done is to estimate the number of
"words in the manuscript, and this is accomplished by averaging the"
"number of words in say thirty lines, and then multiplying by the number"
"of lines on a page. No allowance is made for fractional lines, as these"
"also occur in the printed page. If the manuscript is carefully written,"
"each page will contain the same number of lines, so the total number"
"of words may be found by multiplying the number of words on the page,"
"as arrived at above, by the total number of pages in the manuscript."
This explains the importance of having a standard number of lines on
each page.[32] No allowance is made for fractional pages at the end of
"chapters, as there are also fractional pages in the printed book, and"
it averages up.
"The front matter has to be estimated separately, with allowance for"
"the blanks on the reverse of bastard-title, dedication, etc.,[33] but"
"the usual number of pages is eight. Then, again, an allowance of half"
a page for each chapter sinkage[34] has to be made. Suppose we have a
"manuscript of 90,000 words, with 24 chapters: A type page of 280 words"
"gives us 322 pages, to which we add 8 pages for front and 12 pages"
"Third International, is at the same time reacting most violently away"
"from all other contact, back, recoiling on herself, into a fierce,"
unapproachable Russianism. Which motion will conquer? The workman's
"International, or the centripetal movement into national isolation? Are"
we going to merge into one grey proletarian homogeneity?--or are we
"going to swing back into more-or-less isolated, separate, defiant"
communities?
Probably both. The workman's International movement will finally break
"the flow towards cosmopolitanism and world-assimilation, and suddenly in"
a crash the world will fly back into intense separations. The moment has
"come when America, that extremist in world-assimilation and"
"world-oneness, is reacting into violent egocentricity, a truly"
Amerindian egocentricity. As sure as fate we are on the brink of
American empire.
"For myself, I am glad. I am glad that the era of love and oneness is"
over: hateful homogeneous world-oneness. I am glad that Russia flies
"back into savage Russianism, Scythism, savagely self-pivoting. I am glad"
that America is doing the same. I shall be glad when men hate their
"common, world-alike clothes, when they tear them up and clothe"
"themselves fiercely for distinction, savage distinction, savage"
distinction against the rest of the creeping world: when America kicks
"the billy-cock and the collar-and-tie into limbo, and takes to her own"
national costume: when men fiercely react against looking all alike and
"being all alike, and betake themselves into vivid clan or"
nation-distinctions.
The era of love and oneness is over. The era of world-alike should be at
an end. The other tide has set in. Men will set their bonnets at one
"another now, and fight themselves into separation and sharp distinction."
"The day of peace and oneness is over, the day of the great fight into"
forms.
THE GREAT LENGTH OF GEOLOGIC TIME INFERRED FROM THE SLOW CHANGE OF
"SPECIES. Life forms, like land forms, are thus subject to change"
under the influence of their changing environment and of forces
acting from within. How slowly they change may be seen in the
apparent stability of existing species. In the lifetime of the
"observer and even in the recorded history of man, species seem as"
stable as the mountain and the river. But life forms and land
"forms are alike variable, both in nature and still more under the"
shaping hand of man. As man has modified the face of the earth
"with his great engineering works, so he has produced widely"
different varieties of many kinds of domesticated plants and
"animals, such as the varieties of the dog and the horse, the apple"
"and the rose, which may be regarded in some respects as new"
species in the making. We have assumed that land forms have
changed in the past under the influence of forces now in
operation. Assuming also that life forms have always changed as
"they are changing at present, we come to realize something of the"
immensity of geologic time required for the evolution of life from
its earliest lowly forms up to man.
It is because the onward march of life has taken the same general
course the world over that we are able to use it as a UNIVERSAL
TIME SCALE and divide geologic time into ages and minor
subdivisions according to the ruling or characteristic organisms
"then living on the earth. Thus, since vertebrates appeared, we"
"have in succession the Age of Fishes, the Age of Amphibians, the"
"Age of Reptiles, and the Age of Mammals."
The chart given on page 295 is thus based on the law of
superposition and the law of the evolution of organisms. The first
"infant mind with the stories of his bold adventures, the numerous fights"
"in which he had taken part, the death of his companions and his"
hair-breadth escapes. Numerous were the decorations he bore. The most
conspicuous was an ugly mark on his breast left by an arrow and a hole
on the thigh caused by a spear thrust. The trust imposed on this
marauder proved to be not altogether ill placed for once in a river
journey we were pursued by several long boats filled with armed dacoits.
When these boats came too near for us to effect an escape the erstwhile
"dacoit leader, my attendant, stood up and gave a peculiar cry, which was"
evidently understood. For the pursuing boats vanished at the signal.
INDUSTRIAL EFFORTS
"I come now to another period of his life fifty years from now, when he"
foresaw the economic danger that threatened his country. This
Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition was one of the first means he
thought of to avert the threatened danger. Here also he attempted to
bring together other activities. Evening entertainments were given by
"the performances of ""Jatras,"" which have been the expression of our"
national drama and which have constantly enriched our Bengali literature
by the contributions of village bards and composers. There were athletic
tournaments also and display of physical strength and endurance. He also
"established here the people's Bank, which is now in a most flourishing"
"condition. He established industrial and technical schools, and it was"
there that the inventive bend of my mind received its first impetus. I
remember the deep impression made on my mind by the form of worship
rendered by the artisans to Viswakarma God in his aspect as the Great
Artificer: His hand it was that was moulding the whole creation; and it
"seemed that we were the instruments in his hand, through whom he"
intended to fashion some Great Design.
"appear at Augsburg, stands before the legate Cajetanus and refuses to"
recant. Seething enthusiasm surrounds him. Just about that time Erasmus
"writes to one of Luther's partisans, John Lang, in very favourable terms"
about his work. The theses have pleased everybody. 'I see that the
"monarchy of the Pope at Rome, as it is now, is a pestilence to"
"Christendom, but I do not know if it is expedient to touch that sore"
"openly. That would be a matter for princes, but I fear that these will"
act in concert with the Pope to secure part of the spoils. I do not
understand what possessed Eck to take up arms against Luther.' The
letter did not find its way into any of the collections.
"The year 1519 brought the struggle attending the election of an emperor,"
"after old Maximilian had died in January, and the attempt of the curia"
to regain ground with lenity. Germany was expecting the long-projected
"disputation between Johannes Eck and Andreas Karlstadt which, in truth,"
"would concern Luther. How could Erasmus, who himself was involved that"
"year in so many polemics, have foreseen that the Leipzig disputation,"
which was to lead Luther to the consequence of rejecting the highest
"ecclesiastical authority, would remain of lasting importance in the"
"history of the world, whereas his quarrel with Lee would be forgotten?"
On 28 March 1519 Luther addressed himself personally to Erasmus for the
"first time. 'I speak with you so often, and you with me, Erasmus, our"
ornament and our hope; and we do not know each other as yet.' He
"rejoices to find that Erasmus displeases many, for this he regards as a"
"sign that God has blessed him. Now that his, Luther's, name begins to"
"get known too, a longer silence between them might be wrongly"
"interpreted. 'Therefore, my Erasmus, amiable man, if you think fit,"
"acknowledge also this little brother in Christ, who really admires you"
"and feels friendly disposed towards you, and for the rest would deserve"
"no better, because of his ignorance, than to lie, unknown, buried in a"
corner.'
THE VOICE OF LIFE
"The following is the Inaugural Address delivered by Sir J. C. Bose, on"
"the 30th November 1917, in dedicating the Bose Institute to the Nation."
I dedicate to-day this Institute--not merely a Laboratory but a Temple.
The power of physical methods applies for the establishment of that
"truth which can be realised directly through our senses, or through the"
vast expansion of the perceptive range by means of artificially created
organs. We still gather the tremulous message when the note of the
"audible reaches the unheard. When human sight fails, we continue to"
explore the region of the invisible. The little that we can see is as
nothing compared to the vastness of that which we cannot. Out of the
very imperfection of his senses man has built himself a raft of thought
by which he makes daring adventures on the great seas of the Unknown.
But there are other truths which will remain beyond even the
"supersensitive methods known to science. For these we require faith,"
tested not in a few years but by an entire life. And a temple is erected
as a fit memorial for the establishment of that truth for which faith
"was needed. The personal, yet general, truth and faith whose"
establishment this Institute commemorates is this: that when one
"dedicates himself wholly for a great object, the closed doors shall"
"open, and the seemingly impossible will become possible for him."
Thirty-two years ago I chose teaching of science as my vocation. It was
"held that by its very peculiar constitution, the Indian mind would"
always turn away from the study of Nature to metaphysical speculations.
Even had the capacity for inquiry and accurate observation been assumed
"present, there were no opportunities for their employment; there were no"
well-equipped laboratories nor skilled mechanicians. This was all too
work on a large scale will be compelled to adopt.
"To my mind the United Fruit Company, next to the Panama Canal, is the"
great phenomenon of the Caribbean world today. Some day some one with
knowledge will write a book about it as men have written the history of
"the British East India Company, or the Worshipful Company of Hudson Bay"
"Adventurers, for this distinctly American enterprise has accomplished a"
creative work so wonderful and so romantic as to entitle it to equal
literary consideration. Its coöperation with the Republic of Panama and
the manner in which it has followed the plans formulated by the Isthmian
Commission entitles it to attention in a book treating of Panama.
[Illustration: THE BAY OF BOCAS
This harbor of the chief banana port of Panama would accommodate a navy]
"The banana business is the great trade of the tropics, and one that"
"cannot be reduced in volume by new competition, as cane sugar was"
checked by beet sugar. But it is a business which requires special
machinery of distribution for its success. From the day the banana is
picked until it is in the stomach of the ultimate consumer the time
"should not exceed three weeks. The fruit must be picked green, as, if"
"allowed to ripen on the trees, it splits open and the tropical insects"
"infect it. This same condition, by the way, affects all tropical fruits."
All must be gathered while still unripe. The nearest wholesale market
"for bananas is New Orleans, five days’ steaming. New York is seven days"
away. That means that once landed the fruit must be distributed to
commission houses and agents all over the United States with the utmost
expedition lest it spoil in transit. There can be no holding it in
"storage, cold or otherwise, for a stronger demand or a higher market."
This means that the corporation must deal with agents who can be relied
upon to absorb the cargoes of the ships as regularly as they arrive.
"due to the fact that they are often metalliferous, carrying"
valuable native metals and metallic ores disseminated in fine
"particles, in strings, and sometimes in large masses in the midst"
of the valueless nonmetallic minerals which make up what is known
as the VEIN STONE.
The most common vein stones are QUARTZ and CALCITE. FLUORITE
"(calcium fluoride), a mineral harder than calcite and"
"crystallizing in cubes of various colors, and BARITE (barium"
"sulphate), a heavy white mineral, are abundant in many veins."
The gold-bearing quartz veins of California traverse the
metamorphic slates of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Below the zone
of solution (p. 45) these veins consist of a vein stone of quartz
"mingled with pyrite (p. 13), the latter containing threads and"
grains of native gold. But to the depth of about fifty feet from
"the surface the pyrite of the vein has been dissolved, leaving a"
"rusty, cellular quartz with grains of the insoluble gold scattered"
through it.
The PLACER DEPOSITS of California and other regions are gold-
bearing deposits of gravel and sand in river beds. The heavy gold
"is apt to be found mostly near or upon the solid rock, and its"
"grains, like those of the sand, are always rounded. How the gold"
came in the placers we may leave the pupil to suggest.
"Copper is found in a number of ores, and also in the native metal."
Below the zone of surface changes the ore of a copper vein is
"often a double sulphide of iron and copper called CHALCOPYRITE, a"
mineral softer than pyrite--it can easily be scratched with a
knife--and deeper yellow in color. For several score of feet below
the ground the vein may consist of rusty quartz from which the
commences later. Their sensible properties and medical activity are
"impaired by long keeping. They should be of a green color, and free from"
"mustiness. The root has a feeble earthy odor. Though sweetish at first,"
it has afterwards the same effect as the leaves upon the mouth and
"fauces. It shrinks much in drying and becomes darker, but does not lose"
"its acrimony. Those parcels, whether of leaves or roots, should always"
be rejected which are destitute of this property. Aconite root is
"officially described as being “slenderly conical, 4 to 10 cm. long, 10"
to 20 mm. thick at the crown; occasionally split; longitudinally
wrinkled; dark brown and marked with coarse whitish root-scars; fracture
"short, horny or mealy; internally whitish or light brown; the cambium"
"zone irregular and 5 to 7-angled; odor very slight; taste sweetish, soon"
"becoming acrid and developing a tingling sensation, followed by"
numbness.”
Preparations of the leaves are not official in the U. S. P. The root is
five times stronger than the leaves.
CONSTITUENTS.--The alkaloid representing the action of the drug is
"aconitine, which is precipitated by ammonia from an aqueous solution of"
"an alcoholic extract of the root of various species. It is a colorless,"
"crystalline or amorphous, gray powder, almost insoluble in water, and"
"soluble in 22 parts of alcohol, in 44 parts of ether and 1 part of"
"chloroform. Its salts are soluble in water. Aconitine or its solutions,"
"unless very dilute, are too poisonous to be tasted."
"Commercial preparations vary in purity and strength, and since it is"
extremely poisonous its internal administration is undesirable.
"Pseudo-aconitine, aconitine and other alkaloids in combination with"
"aconitic acid have been obtained from aconite, but their identity and"
chemistry are uncertain.
"about themselves, even to quite trifling and unnecessary details. And,"
"of course, each one thinks himself or herself the ONLY or the chief"
"'celebrity' in London, or, for that matter, in the world. I have always"
"to tone down the egotistical part of it a little, especially with"
"authors, for if I were to write out exactly what THEY separately say of"
"their contemporaries, it would be simply frightful! They would be all"
at daggers drawn in no time! I assure you 'interviewing' is often a
"most delicate and difficult business!"""
"""Would it were altogether impossible!"" said Villiers heartily--""But as"
"long as there is a plethora of little authors, and a scarcity of great"
"ones, so long, I suppose, must it continue--for little men love"
"notoriety, and great ones shrink from it, just in the same way that"
"good women like flattery, while bad ones court it. I hope you don't"
bear me any grudge because I consider my friend Alwyn both good and
"great, and resent the idea of his being placed, no matter with what"
"excellent intention soever, on the level of the small and mean?"""
The lady surveyed him with a twinkle of latent approval in her
pale-colored eyes.
"""Not in the least!"" she replied in a tone of perfect good-humor. ""On"
"the contrary, I rather admire your frankness! Still, I think, that as"
"matters stand nowadays, you are very odd,--and I suppose your friend is"
"odd too,--but, of course, there must be exceptions to every rule. At"
"the same time, you should recollect that, in many people's opinion, to"
"be 'interviewed' is one of the chiefest rewards of fame!--"" Villiers"
"shrugged his shoulders expressively. ""Oh, yes, it seems a poor reward"
"to you, no doubt,""--she continued smilingly,--""but there are no end of"
"authors who would do anything to secure the notoriety of it! Now,"
"suppose that, after all, Mr. Alwyn DOES care to submit to the"
"operation, you will let me know, won't you?"""
"fall."""
"He showed no interest whatever in the new plant, refusing even to look"
it over or to express an opinion upon the progress of the work; so they
"sent him out to the ship, where for days he remained in a toad-like"
"lethargy, basking in the sun, sleeping three-fourths of the time and"
spending his waking hours in repeating the awful tale of his
disgraceful peonage.
"To unload the machinery, particularly the heavier pieces, was by no"
"means a simple matter, owing to the furious tides that set in and out"
of the Kalvik River. The first mishap occurred during the trip on which
"the boilers were towed in, and it looked to Boyd less like an accident"
than a carefully planned move to cripple him at one stroke. The other
ships were busily discharging and the roadstead was alive with small
"craft of various kinds, when the huge boilers were swung over the side"
of _The Bedford Castle_ and blocked into position for the journey to
the shore. George and a half-dozen of his men went along with the load
"while Emerson remained on the ship. They were just well under way when,"
"either by the merest chance or by malicious design, several of the"
rival Company's towboats moored to the neighboring ships cast off. The
anchorage was crowded and a boiling six-mile tide made it difficult at
best to avoid collision.
"Hearing a confused shouting to shoreward, Boyd ran to the rail in time"
to see one of the Company tugs at the head of a string of towboats
bearing down ahead of the current directly upon his own slow-moving
lighter. Already it was so close at hand as to make disaster seem
inevitable. He saw Balt wave his arms furiously and heard him bellow
"profane warnings while the fishermen scurried about excitedly, but"
still the tug held to its course. Boyd raised his voice in a wild
"alarm, but had they heard him there was nothing they could have done."
and loved him. And so it was without the slightest feeling of misgiving
that she watched her lover quickly take down his coat and hat from the
"peg on the wall and start for the door. On the other hand, it must have"
required not a little courage on the man's part to have torn himself
"away from this lovely, if unconventional, creature, just as he was"
"beginning to love truly and appreciate her. But, then, Johnson was a man"
of no mean determination!
"Not daring to trust himself to words, Johnson paused to look back over"
his shoulder at the Girl before plunging forth into the night. But on
opening the door all the multitudinous wild noises of the forests
"reached his ears: Sounds of whispering and rocking storm-tossed pines,"
"sounds of the wind making the rounds of the deep canyon below them,"
"sounds that would have made the blood run cold of a man more daring,"
"even, than himself. Like one petrified he stood blinded, almost, by the"
"great drifts of snow that were being driven into the room, while the"
"cabin rocked and shook and the roof cracked and snapped, the lights"
"flickered, smoked, or sent their tongues of fire upward towards the"
"ceiling, the curtains swayed like pendants in the air, and while"
"baskets, boxes, and other small furnishings of the cabin were blown in"
every direction.
But it was the Girl's quick presence of mind that saved them from being
"buried, literally, under the snow. In an instant she had rushed past him"
"and closed both the outer and inner doors of the cabin; then, going over"
"to the window, she tried to look through the heavily frosted panes; but"
"the falling of the sleet and snow, striking the window like fine shot,"
made it impossible for her to see more than a few inches away.

"and ended with: ""That's the way we git it up here! Look! Look!"""
knowledge. They will announce to an audience of some fifteen hundred
"people, the new discoveries made here, which will be demonstrated for"
the first time before the public. We shall thus maintain continuously
the highest aim of a great Seat of Learning by taking active part in the
_advancement_ and diffusion of knowledge. Through the regular
"publication of the Transactions of the Institute, these Indian"
contributions will reach the whole world. The discoveries made will thus
become public property. No patents will ever be taken. The spirit of our
national culture demands that we should for ever be free from the
desecration of utilising knowledge for personal gain. Besides the
"regular staff there will be a selected number of scholars, who by their"
"work have shown special aptitude, and who would devote their whole life"
to the pursuit of research. They will require personal training and
their number must necessarily be limited. But it is not the quantity
but quality that is of essential importance.
"It is my further wish, that as far as the limited accommodation would"
"permit, the facilities of this Institute should be available to workers"
from all countries. In this I am attempting to carry out the traditions
"of my country, which so far back as twenty-five centuries ago, welcomed"
"all scholars from different parts of the world, within the precincts of"
"its ancient seats of learning, at Nalanda and at Taxilla."
THE SURGE OF LIFE
"With this widened outlook, we shall not only maintain the highest"
traditions of the past but also serve the world in nobler ways. We shall
"be at one with it in feeling the common surgings of life, the common"
"love for the good, the true and the beautiful. In this Institute, this"
"Study and Garden of Life, the claim of art has not been forgotten, for"
"the artist has been working with us, from foundation to pinnacle, and"
study.
I almost smiled with self-contempt when I thought how I had set out the
"previous morning in order to conquer my old world, and how it was now"
receding further and further from me. I looked at the other readers.
"They were mostly old men, engrossed in their studies, just as they had"
been in peace time. I wondered what they thought about the war. I knew
they would not allow it to disturb them much or interfere with their
"studies and their sleep. And after all, why should they care? It was"
only youth that was being slaughtered on the battlefields and not old
age.
The sleepy dullness of the museum became unbearable and I walked out
into the street.
"I spent the evening with a member of the National Liberal Club, an"
"intimate family friend, whose intellectual arrogance was one of the evil"
"memories of my childhood, when many eager impulses and aspirations had"
been turned to bitterness by his lofty depreciation and his
imperturbable assumption of superiority based on maturer years and
experience. Having at different times received material kindnesses at
"his hands, I knew I could not tell him what I really thought, and the"
"prospect of meeting him filled me with uneasiness. Moreover, in his"
presence I felt a kind of pride which I did not usually feel in the
presence of others--a pride that forbade me to express any sentiment or
to reveal my inner mind. And yet my inner mind was clamouring
intolerably for revelation. I realized the advantage he would derive
"from his simple attitude and from his lack of mental integrity, which"
enabled him to ignore any considerations that did not conform to his
"preconceived notions, and I realized the disadvantage of my complex"
"attitude, made up as it was of so many conflicting impulses, at war with"
each other and with the world around me.
We know little of the early career of this remarkable buccaneer. He was
"loved by his crew, and had great influence over them. It is recorded that"
"one Sunday morning, finding some of his men gambling, he threw the dice"
"overboard, saying ""he would have no gambling aboard his ship."""
We know that on one occasion he was caught in his vessel by H.M.S.
"_Success_ and brought to Port Royal, Jamaica, and that on December 1st,"
"1679, he was in prison awaiting trial for piracy. Apparently he got off,"
for this brilliant young buccaneer is soon afterwards heard of as
"commanding a small vessel of sixteen tons, armed with but one gun and a"
"crew of thirty-five men. He was one of a party of 330 buccaneers who,"
"under the leadership of Coxon and Sharp, landed on the coast of Darien and"
marched through the jungle to attack and plunder the town of Santa Maria.
"The remainder of the journey across the isthmus was done in canoes, in"
which the pirates travelled down the Santa Maria River until they found
themselves in the Pacific. On this expedition each captain had his company
"and had his own colours, Sawkins's flag being a red one with yellow"
"stripes. Arrived at the sea, they captured two small Spanish vessels, and,"
"the rest of the company being in the canoes, they boldly sailed towards"
"Panama City. Meeting with the Spanish fleet of eight ships, the buccaneers"
"attacked it, and, after a most furious battle, came off victorious. This"
"was one of the most gallant episodes in the whole history of the ""brethren"
"of the coast,"" and was afterwards known as the Battle of Perico. Sawkins"
"fought in the most brave and desperate manner, and took a large share in"
"the successful enterprise. After this action some quarrelling took place,"
"which ended by Captain Coxon going off with some seventy men, to return"
across the isthmus on foot. The company that remained in the Pacific
"elected Sawkins to be their leader, as Captain Sharp, a much older man,"
was away in his ship.
"The buccaneers, ever since they defeated the Spanish fleet, had blockaded"
"the harbour, and a correspondence took place between the Governor of"
commons by various municipalities. Much of this land lies along the line
"of the railroad from Panama to David, and is of varying grades suitable"
"for grazing, forestry or agriculture. A fixed price of 50 cents per"
"hectare is charged, a hectare being practically 2¹⁄₂ acres. The"
government has gone quite efficiently into the task of disposing of
"these lands, and pamphlets explanatory of methods of securing titles,"
"terms, etc., can be obtained by addressing the Administrator-General at"
"Panama. The Pan-American Union, of Washington, D. C., has issued a"
pamphlet giving a summary in English of the Panamanian law bearing upon
the subject.
[Illustration: A NATIVE LIVING ROOM AND STAIRWAY
"By pulling up the bamboo ladder, or turning it, communication with the"
upper floor is closed]
"With the lack of labor, and the uncertainty of land titles, the final"
impediment to the general development of the interior of Panama is to be
found in the lack of roads. It is not that the roads are bad--that is
the case in many of our own commonwealths. But in a great part of Panama
"there are literally no roads at all. Trails, choked by the jungle and so"
"washed by the rains that they are merely lanes floored with boulders,"
are the rule. The heavy ox-cart is the only vehicle that will stand the
"going, and our light American farm wagons would be speedily racked to"
pieces. In the Canal Zone the Commission has built some of the best
"roads in the world, utilizing the labor of employees convicted of minor"
offenses. Stimulated by this example the Panama government has built one
excellent road from the chief city across the savannas to Old Panama and
thence onward into the interior. It is hoped that the spectacle of the
admirable roads in the Zone will encourage the authorities of the
Republic to go into road building on a large scale in their own country.
In no other way can its possibilities be realized. At present the rivers
faith. It was a world that had never existed as such. For with the
historical reality which the times of Constantine and the great fathers
of the Church had manifested--that of declining Latinity and
"deteriorating Hellenism, the oncoming barbarism and the oncoming"
Byzantinism--it had nothing in common. Erasmus's imagined world was an
"amalgamation of pure classicism (this meant for him, Cicero, Horace,"
Plutarch; for to the flourishing period of the Greek mind he remained
"after all a stranger) and pure, biblical Christianity. Could it be a"
"union? Not really. In Erasmus's mind the light falls, just as we saw in"
"the history of his career, alternately on the pagan antique and on the"
Christian. But the warp of his mind is Christian; his classicism only
"serves him as a form, and from Antiquity he only chooses those elements"
which in ethical tendency are in conformity with his Christian ideal.
[Illustration: XVI. ERASMUS AT THE AGE OF 57]
"And because of this, Erasmus, although he appeared after a century of"
"earlier Humanism, is yet new to his time. The union of Antiquity and the"
"Christian spirit which had haunted the mind of Petrarch, the father of"
"Humanism, which was lost sight of by his disciples, enchanted as they"
"were by the irresistible brilliance of the antique beauty of form, this"
union was brought about by Erasmus.
What pure Latinity and the classic spirit meant to Erasmus we cannot
"feel as he did because its realization does not mean to us, as to him, a"
difficult conquest and a glorious triumph. To feel it thus one must have
"acquired, in a hard school, the hatred of barbarism, which already"
during his first years of authorship had suggested the composition of
the _Antibarbari_. The abusive term for all that is old and rude is
"already Gothic, Goths. The term barbarism as used by Erasmus comprised"
much of what we value most in the medieval spirit. Erasmus's conception
of the great intellectual crisis of his day was distinctly dualistic. He
shall change all that some day; but what does a bachelor want with such
a house as this?  What should I be the better for a crowd of liveried
"servants, eating off their heads, idling away their time dicing and"
drinking?  What have I to give an army of scullions and cooks to do—I
"who seldom take a meal at home after my morning chocolate?  No, no; I"
know a trick worth two of that. I don’t ruin myself to keep a crew of
"fat, lazy rogues about me, cheating me at every turn.  Half a dozen"
fellows and a few kitchen wenches do well enow for me; but when Lady
Sandford comes to her husband’s home—ah well! then we shall see the
"difference."""
But though he talked jestingly from time to time of the Lady Sandford
"that was to be, he gave Grey no hint as to whether his fancy inclined"
more to one or another of the many gay maidens with whom he chatted and
"flirted, danced and romped, in the fashion of the day; and so"
bewildering and dazzling were these young madams and their surroundings
"that the newcomer was lost in a maze of wonder and bewilderment, and"
"found it hard to distinguish one face from another, until he met one,"
different from all the rest.
But Grey was not left idle; he had small time for musing.  The very
first day of his sojourn in London he was surrounded by a fluttering
"crowd of tailors, glove-sellers, barbers, fencers, sellers and purveyors"
"of every imaginable ware, who all professed their eagerness to serve"
"him, and quoted Lord Sandford as a patron who could swear to their"
honesty and the excellence of their goods.
"Into the midst of this motley throng Lord Sandford thrust himself,"
"laughing his great hearty laugh, and quickly sent to the right-about"
"two-thirds of the importunate crowd—a jest here, a keen thrust there, a"
"slap on back or shoulder in another quarter, emphasizing his forcible"
"hints.  And when the room was cleared of all but the lucky few, he flung"
shipwrecked crew casting lots for the next occupant of the kettle could
suffer no greater pangs of apprehension than did the Sisters of Saint
Martha on the imminence of an appointment to the orphanage. They had
taken vows of obedience. The Mother Superior's selection was final.
The unfortunate nominee had to pack up her slender belongings and go
"to Willesden. Being a faulty human being (and none but a faulty,"
"unpractical, unsympathetic human being can want, in these days of"
"enlightenment, to shut herself up in a nunnery for the rest of her life,"
with the avowed intention of never doing a hand's turn for any one of
"God's creatures until the day of her death), she invariably regarded"
herself as a holy martyr and ruled the poor little devils of orphans for
"the greater glory of God (magnified entirely, be it understood, by her"
own martyrdom) than for the greater happiness of the poor little devils.
Sister Theophila--in entering into religion the Protestant Sisters
"changed the names by which they were known in the world, according to"
"the time-honoured tradition of an alien church--Sister Theophila, with"
"the temperament of the recluse, had been thrust into this position"
of responsibility against her will. She performed her duties with
scrupulous exactitude and pious resignation. Her ideal of life was the
"ascetic, and to this ideal the twenty orphans had to conform. She did"
not love the orphans.
"Her staff consisted of one matron, a married woman of a much humbler"
class than her own. Possibly she might have loved the orphans had
"she not seen such a succession of them, and her own work been less"
harassing. Twenty female London orphans from disreputable homes are
a tough handful. When you insist on their conformity with the ascetic
"ideal, they become tougher. They will not allow themselves to be loved."
"“And ungrateful!” exclaimed the matron, one day when she was taking"
Risca round the institution. He had expressed to Sister Theophila his
resurrection of Jesus Christ can be set aside as a “cunningly devised
"fable.” No scientific man, who has not deliberately shut himself in an"
hermetically sealed materialism would say to-day that “Miracles” do
not happen. It is a question of evidence.
"And educated men know that there is a science of metaphysics, that"
"there is a science of psychology, that literary criticism is"
"scientific, that the age of a document can be decided, that cumulative"
"evidence cannot be ignored, and that simply to put aside the claims of"
Christianity without examination is absurd.
"But, as Sir Leslie Stephen shows, it is the Christianity of the"
"Catholic creed that matters, and it is this Christianity of which the"
man in the street has need. It gives him a solution of those social
"and ethical problems which he must solve, which he can only neglect at"
"the peril of natural degradation. For example, the position of women"
depends upon our belief or disbelief that Christ was born of the
Virgin Mary. To say that monogamy is the natural evolution of
"humanity, that chastity in the young unmarried man is a product of"
"civilization, that a high conception of a man’s duty to posterity will"
"keep him from harlotry, is simply to show ignorance of history, of"
"human nature, and of the world as it is. A man who talks now-a-days"
about the respect of marriage being a Teutonic contribution to the
"evolution of civilized society, is behind the times. We _know_ that"
"respect for women, and marriage held in honour, are the creations of"
"the Holy Catholic Church, which insists on the Incarnation of the Lord"
Jesus Christ.
But the man in the street does not know these things. The discoveries
"in science, whether physical or psychical, do not reach him. Technical"
treatises are too strong meat for his intellectual digestion. The
pulpit does not appeal to him. At every baptism in the Church of
starting therefore a few days ahead of the Dobuan uvalaku fleet. I
"rowed over in a dinghy to the big village, and watched the loading and"
"departing of the canoes. There was a bustle in the village, and even a"
few old women could be seen helping the men in their tasks. The large
"canoes were being pushed into the water from their supports, on which"
they were beached. They had been already prepared for the journey
"there, their platforms covered with plaited palm leaves, frames put"
"in their bottoms to support the cargo, boards placed crossways within"
"the canoe to serve as seats for the crew, the mast, rigging and sail"
"laid handy. The loading, however, begins only after the canoe is in"
"water. The large, trough-shaped chunks of sago were put at the bottom,"
"while men and women carefully brought out the big clay pots, stowing"
them away with many precautions in special places in the middle
"(see Plate XLVII). Then, one after the other, the canoes went off,"
paddling round the southern end of the island towards the West. At
"about ten o'clock in the morning, the last canoe disappeared round the"
"promontory, and the village remained practically empty. There was no"
"saying of farewells, not a trace of any emotion on the part of those"
"leaving or those remaining. But it must be remembered that, owing to"
"my presence, no women except one or two old hags, were visible on the"
"shore. All my best informants gone, I intended to move to Nabwageta"
"next morning. At sunset, I made a long excursion in my dinghy round"
"the western shores of Gumasila, and it was on that occasion that I"
discovered all those who had left that morning on the Kula sitting on
"Giyasila beach, in accordance with the Kula custom of a preliminary"
"halt, such as the one on Muwa described in Chapter VII."
"Next morning, I left for the neighbouring island and village of"
"Nabwageta, and only after he saw me safely off, Tovasana and his party"
"left in his canoe, following the others to Vakuta. In Nabwageta, the"
whole community were in the midst of their final preparations for
"departure, for they intended to wait for the Dobuans and sail with"
"easy life, but one of unending struggle. It is for him to cast his life"
"as an offering, regarding gain and loss, success and failure, as one."
Yet in my case this long persisting gloom was suddenly lifted. My
"scientific deputation in 1914, from the Government of India, gave the"
opportunity of giving demonstrations of my discoveries before the
leading scientific societies of the world. This led to the acceptance of
"my theories and results, and the recognition of the importance of the"
Indian contribution to the advancement of the world's science. My own
"experience told me how heavy, sometimes even crushing, are the"
difficulties which confront an inquirer here in India; yet it made me
"stronger in my determination, that I shall make the path of those who"
"are to follow me less arduous, and that India, is never to relinquish"
what has been won for her after years of struggle.
THE TWO IDEALS
What is it that India is to win and maintain? Can anything small or
circumscribed ever satisfy the mind of India? Has her own history and
the teaching of the past prepared her for some temporary and quite
subordinate gain? There are at this moment two complementary and not
antagonistic ideals before the country. India is drawn into the vortex
of international competition. She has to become efficient in every
"way,--through spread of education, through performance of civic duties"
"and responsibilities, through activities both industrial and commercial."
Neglect of these essentials of national duty will imperil her very
existence; and sufficient stimulus for these will be found in success
and satisfaction of personal ambition.
But these alone do not ensure the life of a nation. Such material
"activities have brought in the West their fruit, in accession of power"
"and wealth. There has been a feverish rush even in the realm of science,"
"fell with terrific force upon the dome of the lantern, splintering the"
"roof and smashing the light, so that no welcome rays could be thrown"
from the tower again that night. The keepers at once set to work with
"the fog-signal, and during the hours of darkness worked like slaves,"
blaring out a warning by sound which they were unable to give visually.
"Fortunately, such an experience as befell the keepers of the American"
Thimble Shoal light is very rare. This beacon marks the shoal of that
"name, and is, or rather was, a screw-pile iron lighthouse, marking 11"
"feet of water at the entrance to Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, U.S.A. On"
"December 27, 1909, the keepers were immersed in their tasks, when there"
was a terrible crash followed by a dismal rending and splitting. The
building shivered from top to bottom. The keepers were thrown off their
"feet, and when they regained their wits they found that the schooner"
"_Malcolm Baxter Junior_, while being towed by a tug, had blundered into"
"them, and had carried a considerable portion of the building away. The"
"impact upset the light; the scattered oil burst into flame, and within"
a few minutes the lighthouse was blazing like a gigantic bonfire. The
"keepers stuck to their posts, and endeavoured frantically to extinguish"
"the outbreak, but their efforts were too puny to make any impression."
"At last, when a foothold was no longer possible with safety, and under"
"extreme pressure, they abandoned their charge. When the flames had"
completed their destructive work the lighthouse presented a sorry
"sight, being a mass of broken and twisted ironwork. A wooden tower was"
"erected with all despatch, and a fog-signal was installed, so that the"
men could carry on their duties while the reconstruction of the station
was hurried forward.
"The keepers turn their hands to strange occupations. Fretwork,"
"wood-carving, poker-work, and similar hobbies, are practised freely."
A few devote their leisure to intellectual improvement to fit them
"for other walks in life. The keeper of Windward Point, Guantanamo"
(vi) Cases in which an incision and the ligature of a parietal artery
are indicated are very rare. I never saw such a one myself.
"(vii) If a hæmothorax suppurates, it must be treated on the ordinary"
lines of an empyema. In view of the constant formation of adhesions and
"difficulty in drainage, a portion of a rib should always be resected in"
"order to ensure sufficient space for after-treatment. The cavities, as a"
"rule, are better irrigated, the usual precautions being taken where"
there is any reason to fear that the lung is still in communication with
the cavity.
"Care in carrying out asepsis in tapping, which should be performed with"
"an aspirator, need hardly be more than mentioned. It will be noted that"
"in some of the cases quoted suppuration followed tapping, but it must be"
remembered that in these the two primary wounds already existed as
possible channels of infection.
Retained bullets of small calibre in the thoracic cavity were not
"common, unless the lodgment had occurred in the bodies of the vertebræ."
"I saw very few. Shrapnel bullets and fragments of shells, however, were,"
"in proportion to the frequency of wounds from such projectiles, more"
commonly retained. The rules to be followed in such cases do not
materially deviate from those to be observed in the body generally.
"When the bullet is causing no trouble, and is lodged in either the bone"
"of the spine or the lung substance, no interference is advisable. When,"
"on the other hand, the bullet as viewed by the X-rays is seen to be in"
"the pleural cavity, and any symptoms of its presence exist, it may be"
justifiable to remove it. I saw this done in one case for the removal of
a shrapnel bullet from the lower reflexion of the pleura on account of
"fixed pain and tenderness complained of by the patient. The bullet, a"
"More forcible lateral impact produced a split of the peritoneum, or of"
this together with the muscular coat. Such a lateral slit is shown in
"fig. 85, although the clearness of outline is somewhat impaired by the"
presence of a considerable amount of inflammatory lymph.
Fig. 86 exhibits a lateral injury of a more pronounced form. The bullet
here struck the most prominent portion of the under surface of the
"bowel, and produced a circular perforation not very unlike one produced"
"by rectangular impact, except in the lesser degree of eversion of the"
mucous membrane. Here again the appearance is somewhat altered by the
"presence of a considerable amount of lymph, but this is of less"
importance in this figure because the lymph is localised to the portion
of the bowel in the immediate neighbourhood of the opening which had

"Fig. 87, A B, illustrates a symmetrical perforation of the small"
"intestine; the aperture of entry (A) is roughly circular, and a ring of"
mucous membrane protrudes and partially closes the opening. The aperture
"of exit is a curved slit, again partially occluded by the mucous"
membrane. The same amount of difference between the two apertures did
"not always exist; in many cases both were circular, and apparently"
"symmetrical. Beyond this I have seen three apertures in close proximity,"
"two lying on the same aspect of the bowel, and the first of these was no"
doubt an opening due to lateral impact similar to that seen in fig. 86.
In the recent condition little difference existed between the three
apertures.
"pearl among women. And she told the king that he was right, and she was"
"wrong. She said, putting her arms about him and caressing him, that she"
had discovered that it was true that her brother had been plotting
"against the king, and therefore his death was necessary. It was"
"terrible, she said, to find that her brother, whom she had always held"
"as a pattern, was no better than a traitor; but it was even so, and her"
king was the wisest of all kings to find it out.
"The king was delighted to find his queen in this mood, and he soothed"
"her and talked to her kindly and sweetly, for he really loved her,"
though he had given in to bad advice about the brother. And when the
"king's suspicions were lulled, the queen said to him that she had now"
"but one request to make, and that was that she might have permission to"
"go down with her maids to the river-shore in the early morning, and see"
"herself the execution of her traitor brother. The king, who would now"
"have granted her anything--anything she asked, except just that one"
"thing, the life of her brother--gave permission; and then the queen said"
that she was tired and wished to rest after all the trouble of the last
"few days, and would the king leave her. So the king left her to herself,"
and went away to his own chambers.
"Very early in the morning, ere the crimson flush upon the mountains had"
"faded in the light of day, a vast crowd was gathered below the city, by"
"the shore of the great river. Very many thousands were there, of many"
"countries and peoples, crowding down to see a man die, to see a traitor"
"burnt to death for his sins, for there is nothing men like so much as to"
see another man die.
"Upon a little headland jutting out into the river the pyre was raised,"
"with brushwood and straw, to burn quickly, and an iron post in the"
middle to which the man was to be chained. At one side was a place
"reserved, and presently down from the palace in a long procession came"
"frank amazement and admit itself surpassed! Here, indeed, was all the"
"vital, colorful magnetism of a type that men are quick to die for!"
Her gown--yet how can man describe a woman's gown? It was a very rich
"affair and added to the picture. But this I did observe distinctly, that"
in revealing her arms and shoulders there was no slightest hint of that
abandonment of _décolleté_ which denotes the approach of feminine
"despair, nor was the color in her cheeks a result of anything less pure"
than the kiss of air and sunshine.
"Her _vis-à-vis_, almost too old to have been her father, was one of"
"those whose nationality is difficult to place. His hair, mustache and"
"Vandyke beard were gray; he was tall, thin, and perhaps seventy-five"
years old. His complexion impressed one most unpleasantly because of its
"sallow, almost yellow, hue; and although I had not yet had a full-face"
view of him I intuitively knew that his teeth were long and thin and
"yellow. A slight palsy never let his head be still, as if some"
"persistent agent were making him deny, eternally deny, an inarticulate"
accusation--as accusations of the conscience perforce must be.
"Despite his grumpy silence he showed an air of repressed excitement,"
"sending frequent, shifty glances over the room; and that he possessed"
the temper of a fiend I did not doubt after seeing him turn upon the
waiter for some trifling omission and reduce that usually placid
"individual to a state of amazed incapacity. Then a quick, really a"
"pitiful, look of terror came into the girl's eyes as she shrank back in"
her chair. It lasted but a second before she was again making herself
"agreeable--acting, of course--and I wanted to cross to him and demand:"
"""Why is this lady afraid?"""
I hated the man; at first sight I loathed him. It was one of those
antipathies sometimes observed in dogs that see each other from a
"them to Kiriwina. All their canoes were being painted and renovated,"
a sail was being repaired on the beach (see Plate LIII). There were
"some minor distributions of food taking place in the village, the stuff"
"being over and over again allotted and re-allotted, smaller pieces"
carved out of the big chunks and put into special wrappings. This
constant handling of food is one of the most prominent features of
"tribal life in that part of the world. As I arrived, a sail for one of"
"the canoes was just being finished by a group of men. In another canoe,"
"I saw them mending the outrigger by attaching the small log of light,"
"dry wood to make the old, waterlogged float more buoyant. I could"
"also watch in detail the final trimming of the canoes, the putting"
"up of the additional frames, of the coco-nut mats, the making of the"
little cage in the central part for the pots and for the lilava (the
"sacred bundle), I was, nevertheless, not on sufficiently intimate"
terms with these Nabwageta natives to be allowed to witness any of
"the magic. Their system of mwasila is identical with that of Boyowa,"
"in fact, it is borrowed from there."
Next day--in this village again I had difficulty in finding any good
"informants, a difficulty increased by the feverish occupation of all"
"the men--I went for a long row in the afternoon with my two 'boys,'"
"hoping to reach the island of Domdom. A strong current, which in this"
"part is at places so pronounced that it breaks out into steep, tidal"
"waves, made it impossible to reach our goal. Returning in the dark,"
"my boys suddenly grew alert and excited, like hounds picking up a"
"scent. I could perceive nothing in the dark, but they had discerned"
"two canoes moving westwards. Within about half-an-hour, a fire became"
"visible, twinkling on the beach of a small, deserted island South"
of Domdom; evidently some Dobuans were camping there. The excitement
"and intense interest shown by my boys, one a Dobuan, the other from"
"Sariba (Southern Massim), gave me an inkling of the magnitude of"
this event--the vanguard of a big Kula fleet slowly creeping up
have been brought from very far away; and in explanation he was told a
curious story.
It appeared that in the old days there used to be only a bamboo and
"grass monastery there, such a monastery as most jungle villages have;"
and the then monk was distressed at the smallness of his abode and the
little accommodation there was for his school--a monastery is always a
school. So one rainy season he planted with great care a number of teak
"seedlings round about, and he watered them and cared for them. 'When"
"they are grown up,' he would say, 'these teak-trees shall provide"
timber for a new and proper building; and I will myself return in
"another life, and with those trees will I build a monastery more worthy"
"than this.' Teak-trees take a hundred years to reach a mature size, and"
"while the trees were still but saplings the monk died, and another monk"
"taught in his stead. And so it went on, and the years went by, and from"
"time to time new monasteries of bamboo were built and rebuilt, and the"
"teak-trees grew bigger and bigger. But the village grew smaller, for the"
"times were troubled, and the village was far away in the forest. So it"
happened that at last the village found itself without a monk at all:
"the last monk was dead, and no one came to take his place."
"It is a serious thing for a village to have no monk. To begin with,"
there is no one to teach the lads to read and write and do arithmetic;
and there is no one to whom you can give offerings and thereby get
"merit, and there is no one to preach to you and tell you of the sacred"
teaching. So the village was in a bad way.
"Then at last one evening, when the girls were all out at the well"
"drawing water, they were surprised by the arrival of a monk walking in"
"from the forest, weary with a long journey, footsore and hungry. The"
"villagers received him with enthusiasm, fearing, however, that he was"
"but passing through, and they furbished up the old monastery in a hurry"
the religion of Egypt came into contact with Greece. Isis was identified
"simultaneously with Demeter, Aphrodite, Hera, Semele, Io, Tyche, and"
"others. She was considered the queen of heaven and hell, of earth and sea."
"She was ""the past, the present and the future,""[42] ""nature the mother of"
"things, the mistress of the elements, born at the beginning of the"
"centuries.""[43] She had numberless names, an infinity of different aspects"
"and an inexhaustible treasure of virtues. In short, she became a"
"pantheistic power that was everything in one, _una quae est omnia_.[44]"
"The authority of Serapis was no less exalted, and his field no less"
extensive. He also was regarded as a universal god of whom men liked to say
"that he was ""unique."" ([Greek: Heis Zeus Sarapis]) In him all energies were"
"centered, although the functions of Zeus, of Pluto or of Helios were"
especially ascribed to him. For many centuries Osiris had been worshiped at
"Abydos both as author of fecundity and lord of the underworld,[45] and this"
"double character early caused him to be identified with the sun, which"
fertilizes the earth during its diurnal course and travels through the
"subterranean realms at night. Thus the conception of this nature divinity,"
"that had already prevailed along the Nile, accorded without difficulty with"
the solar pantheism that was the last form of Roman paganism. This
"theological system, which did not gain the upper hand in the Occident until"
"the {90} second century of our era, was not brought in by Egypt. It did not"
"have the exclusive predominance there that it had held under the empire,"
and even in Plutarch's time it was only one creed among many.[46] The
deciding influence in this matter was exercised by the Syrian Baals and the
Chaldean astrology.
"The theology of the Egyptian mysteries, then, followed rather than led the"
general influx of ideas. The same may be said of their ethics. It did not
"force itself upon the world by lofty moral precepts, nor by a sublime ideal"
"of holiness. Many have admired the edifying list in the Book of the Dead,"
that rightfully or otherwise sets forth the virtues which the deceased
"till the outside and inside layers are gone, and there remains only a"
"red, flat tablet, polished on both sides. In the middle of it, a hole"
"is drilled through by means of a pump drill--gigi'u--(see Plate LI),"
"and a number of such perforated discs are then threaded on a thin,"
"but tough stick (see Plate LII), with which we have already met in"
the myth. Then the cylindrical roll is rubbed round and round on
"the flat sandstone, until its form becomes perfectly symmetrical"
"(see Plate LII). Thus a number of flat, circular discs, polished"
"all round and perforated in the middle, are produced. The breaking"
"and the drilling, like the diving are done exclusively by men. The"
polishing is as a rule woman's work.
This technology is associated with an interesting sociological relation
between the maker and the man for whom the article is made. As has
"been stated in Chapter II, one of the main features of the Trobriand"
organisation consists of the mutual duties between a man and his
wife's maternal kinsmen. They have to supply him regularly with yams
"at harvest time, while he gives them the present of a valuable now and"
then. The manufacture of kaloma valuables in Sinaketa is very often
associated with this relationship. The Sinaketan manufacturer makes his
"kutadababile (necklace of large beads) for one of his relatives-in-law,"
"while this latter pays him in food. In accordance with this custom, it"
happens very frequently that a Sinaketan man marries a woman from one
"of the agricultural inland villages, or even a woman of Kiriwina. Of"
"course, if he has no relatives-in-law in one of these villages, he"
"will have friends or distant relatives, and he will make the string"
"for one or the other of them. Or else he will produce one for himself,"
and launch it into the Kula. But the most typical and interesting
"case is, when the necklace is produced to order for a man who repays"
"it according to a remarkable economic system, a system similar to"
"the payments in instalments, which I have mentioned with regard to"
"canoe making. I shall give here, following closely the native text,"
of the infernal regions assigned everybody a place according to his
deserts.[53] The doctrine of future retribution was beginning to develop.
"However, in this regard, as in their conception of the divinity, the"
Egyptian mysteries followed the general progress of ideas more than they
"directed it. {93} Philosophy transformed them, but found in them little"
inspiration.
*       *       *       *       *
"How could a religion, of which neither the theology nor the ethics was"
"really new, stir up at the same time so much hostility and fervor among the"
"Romans? To many minds of to-day theology and ethics constitute religion,"
"but during the classical period it was different, and the priests of Isis"
and Serapis conquered souls mainly by other means. They seduced them by the
powerful attraction of the ritual and retained them by the marvelous
promises of their doctrine of immortality.
To the Egyptians ritual had a value far superior to that we ascribe to it
to-day. It had an operative strength of its own that was independent of the
intentions of the officiating priest. The efficacy of prayer depended not
"on the inner disposition of the believer, but on the correctness of the"
"words, gestures and intonation. Religion was not clearly differentiated"
"from magic. If a divinity was invoked according to the correct forms,"
"especially if one knew how to pronounce its real name, it was compelled to"
act in conformity to the will of its priest. The sacred words were an
incantation that compelled the superior powers to obey the officiating
"person, no matter what purpose he had in view. With the knowledge of the"
liturgy men acquired an immense power over the world of spirits. Porphyry
was surprised and indignant because the Egyptians sometimes dared to
threaten the gods in their orations.[54] In the consecrations the priest's
"summons compelled the gods to come and animate their {94} statues, and thus"
afternoon _The Bedford Castle_ lay at her moorings subjected to the
"customary eleventh-hour delays. As the time dragged on, and the liquor"
"died in the fishermen, it became a herculean task to prevent them from"
"issuing forth into the street, while the crowds outside seemed"
possessed of a desperate determination to force an entrance and bring
the issue to a final settlement. But across the shore end of the dock a
double cordon was drawn which hurled back the intruders at every
advance.
"The fishermen who remained inside the barnlike structure, unable to"
"come at their enemies, fought among themselves, bidding fair to wreck"
"the building in the extravagance of their delirium, while outside the"
rival faction kept up a fire of missiles and execrations. As the hours
"crept onward the tension increased, and at last Boyd turned to Captain"
"Peasley saying, ""You'd better be ready to pull out at any minute, for"
"if the mob breaks in we'll never be able to hold these maniacs."" He"
"pointed to the black swarm aloft, whence issued hoarse waves of sound."
"""I don't like the look of things, a little bit."""
"""They are a trifle strained, to be sure,"" the Captain acknowledged."
"""I'll stand by to cast off at your signal, so you'd better pass the"
"word around."""
"Boyd left the ship and went to the dock-office, for there still"
remained one thing to be done: he could not leave without sounding a
final note of triumph for Mildred. How sweet it would be to her ears he
"knew full well, yet he could not help wondering if she would feel the"
thrill that mastered him at this moment. As he saw the empty spaces
where had stood those masses of freight which he had gathered at such
"cost, as he heard his own men bellowing defiance at his enemies and"
"realized that his first long stride toward success had been taken, his"
heart swelled with gladness and the breath caught momentarily in his
standing motionless against the wall. The fellow seemed as startled at
"the encounter as Emerson, and with a sharp exclamation leaped away and"
vanished into the gloom. Boyd lost no time in gaining the plank runway
"that led to the dock, and finding an angle in the building, backed into"
"it and waited, half-suspecting that he had stumbled into a trap. He"
reflected that both the hour and the circumstances were unpropitious;
"for in case he should meet with foul play, Marsh might plausibly claim"
"that he had been mistaken for a marauder. He determined, therefore, to"
proceed with the greatest caution. From his momentary glimpse of the
"man as he made off, he knew that he was tall and active--just the sort"
of person to prove dangerous in an encounter. But if his suspicions
"were correct there must be others close by, and Boyd wondered why he"
"had heard no signal. After a breathless wait of a moment or two, he"
"stole cautiously out, and, selecting the darkest shadows, slipped from"
one to another till he was caught by the sound of voices issuing from
the yawning entrance of the main building on his right. The next moment
his tension relaxed; one of the speakers was a woman. Evidently his
"alarm had been needless, for these people, whoever they were, made no"
"effort to conceal their presence. On the contrary, the woman had raised"
"her tone to a louder pitch, although her words were still"
undistinguishable.
"Greatly relieved, Boyd was about to go on, when a sharp cry, like a"
"signal, came in the woman's voice, a cry which turned to a genuine wail"
"of distress. The listener heard a man's voice cursing in answer, and"
"then the sound of a scuffle, followed at length by a choking cry, that"
"brought him bounding into the building. He ran forward, recklessly, but"
before he had covered half the distance he collided violently with a
piece of machinery and went sprawling to the floor. A glance upward
"revealed the dim outlines of a ""topper,"" and showed him farther down"
"the building, silhouetted briefly against the lesser darkness of the"
"windows, two struggling figures. As he regained his footing, something"
"in her nearness. At the same time he was seized with the old,"
half-resentful curiosity to learn her history. What wealth of romance
"lay shadowed in her eyes, what tragic story was concealed by her"
"consistent silence, he could only guess; for she was a woman who spoke"
rarely of herself and lived wholly in the present. Her very reticence
"inspired confidence, and Boyd felt sure that here was a girl to whom"
one might confess the inmost secrets of a wretched soul and rest secure
in the knowledge that his confession would be inviolate as if locked in
"the heart of mountains. He knew her for a steadfast friend, and he"
"t'elt that she was beautiful, not only in face and form, but in all"
those little indescribable mannerisms which stamp the individual. And
"this girl was here alone with him, so close that by stretching out his"
arms he might enfold her. She allowed him to come and go at will; her
intimacy with him was almost like that of an unspoiled boy--yet
"different, so different that he thrilled at the thought, and the blood"
pounded up into his throat.
It may have been the unusual ardor of his gaze that warmed her cheeks
"and brought her eyes back from the world outside. At any rate, she"
"turned, flashing him a startled glance that caused his pulse to leap"
"anew. Her eyes widened and a flush spread slowly upward to her hair,"
"then her lids drooped, as if weighted by unwonted shyness, and rising"
"silently, she went past him to the piano. Never before had she"
"surprised that look in his eyes, and at the realization a wave of"
confusion surged over her. She strove to calm herself through her
"music, which shielded while it gave expression to her mood, and neither"
spoke as the evening shadows crept in upon them. But the girl's
exaltation was short-lived; the thought came that Boyd's feeling was
but transitory; he was not the sort to burn lasting incense before more
"than one shrine. Nevertheless, at this moment he was hers, and in the"
joy of that certainty she let the moments slip.
"outlying district, and she had been the only person in the house that"
"night. She let beds to single men, she said, and the night before two"
"men had arrived, one the worse for drink. They had asked for adjoining"
"rooms. As they went up-stairs, she had heard the one who had been"
"drinking say to the other, ""What are you bringing me here for? This"
"isn't the place for what I want."" His companion, the shorter of the two,"
"whom she thought she would know again, had answered--""All in good time;"
"you go and lie down, and I'll fetch what you want."" Soon after, the"
short one came down and asked if she had any brandy; she gave him a
bottle half full and he went up-stairs again. She heard voices raised as
"if in dispute for a few minutes, and one of them--she could not say"
"which--said something which sounded like ""Well, finish the drink first,"
"and then I'll go."" Silence followed, at least she could not hear any"
"more talking; and presently, it not being her business to spy on"
"gentlemen, she went to bed, and knew nothing more till she woke at"
"seven o'clock. Going up-stairs, she found one door open and the room"
"empty, not the room the two men had been in together, but the other. The"
"second door was locked, and she did not knock; gentlemen often slept"
"late. At half-past ten she ventured to knock, got no answer, knocked"
"again and again, and finally, with the help of the man from next door,"
broke the lock and found the taller of the two men dead on the bed. She
"had at once summoned the police; and that, she concluded, was all she"
"knew about the matter, and she was a respectable, hard-working woman, a"
widow who could produce her marriage certificate in case any person
present desired to inspect it.
The Superintendent listened to her protestations of virtue with an
"ironical smile, told her the police knew her house very well, frightened"
"her wholesomely, took down her very vague description of the missing"
"man, and kept her in custody; but he did not seriously doubt the truth"
"of her story, and, if it were true, the man he wanted was evidently the"
"sober man, the shorter man, who had introduced his friend to the house"
"labourer gets away from his taskmaster, and comes panting into the"
"lighthouse territory. This is sanctuary to the hapless wretch, and"
although the keepers invariably receive a call from the runaway’s
"master, he meets with scant courtesy, while his demand for the"
surrender of the fugitive is answered by a point-blank refusal. The
"slave-driver may storm, threaten, and abuse, to his heart’s content,"
"and, as he is generally a past-master in Arabian invective, the"
keepers have to listen to a pretty tune. But the slave is kept in the
"lighthouse until the relief-tender makes its periodical call, when he"
is taken back to Suez and liberated.
"Fortunately, owing to the extreme care that is manifested by the"
"authorities, mishaps at a lighthouse are few and far between. The"
men are supplied with rules and regulations which are drawn up with
"an eye for every possible emergency. Yet accidents will happen, due"
in the majority of instances to familiarity bred of contempt. The
majority of these calamities occur in connection with the explosive
"fog-signalling apparatus, although every device is adopted to safeguard"
the men. At one of the Scottish stations a keeper was manipulating
"the fog-signal, but, flying in the face of instructions, he caused"
"the charge to explode prematurely. The man escaped injury, but the"
detonation shattered several panes of glass in the lantern.
"One of the keepers of the Rathlin light, on Altacarry Head, was not so"
fortunate. The White Star Canadian liner _Megantic_ was rounding the
corner of Ireland to enter the last lap of the homeward journey one
"Saturday evening, when the captain’s attention was arrested by a signal"
of distress flying from the lighthouse. The interpretation of the
"signal revealed the fact that a doctor was wanted, so, easing up the"
"ship, he lowered a boat, and the doctor was sent away to the island."
Upon landing he found one of the men in dire straits. He had been
"cleaning the fog-gun, when a charge, which had been left in the weapon"
"fully, and is well worth reading. He had many ups and downs in his early"
seafaring life in the West Indies; being no less than three times taken by
"the pressgang, each time escaping. He served in Dutch and Spanish"
"privateers, and eventually rose to being a pirate captain, making his"
"headquarters in Madagascar. From here he sailed out to the East Indies,"
and preyed on the ships of the East India Company. Several times he was
"wrecked, once he was the only survivor, and swam ashore at Madagascar"
stark naked. The unusual sight of a naked Englishman spread terror amongst
"the natives who were on the beach, and they all fled into the jungle"
"except one, a woman, who from previous personal experience knew that this"
"was but a human being and not a sea devil. She supplied him with clothes,"
"of a sort, and led him to the nearest pirate settlement, some six miles"
away. On another occasion when the pirates were having a jollification
"ashore, having left their Moorish prisoners on the ship at anchor, North"
"gave the prisoners a hint to clear off in the night with the ship,"
otherwise they would all be made slaves. This friendly hint was acted
"upon, and in the morning both ship and prisoners had vanished. The pirates"
"having lost their ship took to the peaceful and harmless life of planters,"
"with North as their ruler. He won the confidence of the natives, who"
abided by his decision in all quarrels and misunderstandings. Occasionally
North and his men would join forces with a neighbouring friendly tribe and
"go to war, North leading the combined army, and victory always resulted."
"The call of piracy was too strong in his bones to resist, and after three"
years planting he was back to sea and the Jolly Roger once more. On one
"occasion he seized the opportunity, when in the neighbourhood of the"
"Mascarenhas Islands, to go ashore and visit the Catholic priest and"
"confess, and at the same time made suitable arrangements for his children"
to be educated by the Church. North evidently truly repented his former
"sins, for he returned to resume his simple life on his plantation. On"
arriving home he found the settlement in an uproar. He soon settled all
"the disputes, appeased the natives, and before long had this garden-city"
of pirates back in its previous peaceful and happy state. Beyond an
"noisiest crowd being a group of young seminarians, prospective priests,"
who occupied the same bench with us and the two or three nearest to
it. After we had been there an hour the great clock of St. Peter's
struck twelve. Instantly all the noisy young seminarians rose to their
"feet and began to recite, in a lower, humming tone, their _Ave-Marias_"
and _Pater-Nosters_. As soon as the reciting and counting of beads
"was over, as it was in a minute, they struck in again with their gay"
conversation. We had plenty of time to take it all in. The Pope is
"always late, and it was an hour after the time fixed for the audience"
"when he appeared; but at last he did, and instantly everybody, men and"
"women, sprang up on the benches and chairs, frantically waving their"
"handkerchiefs and shouting at the top of their voices, ""_Evviva il"
"Papa-Re! Evviva il Papa-Re!_""--""Long live the Pope-King! Long live the"
"Pope-King!""--the ablest performer in this part of the ceremony being a"
"leather-lunged young priest at my elbow, with a voice as powerful and"
"persistent as that of a hungry calf, and who made known his desire"
for the restoration of the temporal power to the Pope with such energy
that the perspiration rolled down his fat face in shining rivulets.
I never heard anything like it except in a political convention or a
"stock exchange. Accompanied by the Noble Guard, a body of picked men"
"renowned for their superb physique and clad in resplendent uniform, the"
"Holy Father was borne in on an arm-chair, carried by twelve men, also"
"in uniform. Occasionally he would rise to his feet with evident effort,"
"leaning on, or rather grasping, one arm of his chair, and bless the"
"people he was passing, with two fingers outstretched in the familiar"
attitude that we have seen in the pictures. At such times the furious
"acclamations, and waving of handkerchiefs, and clapping of hands,"
"would be redoubled. He passed within arm's length of us, a little knot"
"of Protestants, silent amid the uproar. It was a pitiful spectacle."
"A pallid, feeble, tottering old man, with slender, shrunken neck,"
"and excessively sharp and prominent features, nose and chin almost"
"meeting--we now understood Zola's description: ""The simious ugliness of"
"at Lucknow, before a crowded audience which included the"
Lieutenant-Governor (Sir James Meston).
"Dr. Bose, in course of his lecture, spoke of the imperfection of our"
"senses. Our ear, for example, fails to respond to all sounds. There are"
many sounds to which we are deaf. This was because our ear was tuned to
answer to the narrow range of eleven octaves of sound vibrations. He
showed a remarkable experiment of an artificial ear which remained
"irresponsive to various sounds, but when a particular note, to which it"
"was tuned, was sounded even at the distant end of the hall, this ear"
picked it up and responded violently. As there were sounds audible and
"inaudible, so there were lights visible and invisible. The imperfection"
"of our eye as a detector of ether vibrations was, however, far more"
serious. The eye could detect ether vibrations lying within a single
octave--between 400 to 800 billion vibrations per second. Comparatively
slow vibrations of ether did not affect our eye and the disturbances
"they give rise to well-known as electric waves. The electric waves,"
"predicted by Maxwell, were discovered by Hertz. These waves were about"
three metres long. They were about ten million times larger than the
beams of visible light. Dr. Bose showed that the three short electric
"waves have the same property as a beam of light, exhibiting reflections,"
"refraction, even total reflection, through a black crystal, double"
"refraction, polarisation, and rotation of the plane of polarisation. The"
thinnest film of air was sufficient to produce total reflection of
visible light with its extremely short wave lengths. But with the new
"electric waves which he produced, Dr. Bose showed that the critical"
thickness of air space determined by the refracting power of the prison
and by the wave length of electric oscillations. Dr. Bose determined the
"index of refraction of electric waves for different materials, and"
eliminated a difficulty which presented itself in Maxwell's theory as to
the relation between the index of refraction of light and the
di-electric constant of insulators. He also measured the wave lengths of
lines before us we shall be better able to appreciate the later
playwright's genius. But we shall also be reminded that the credit of
introducing blank verse must lie with the older man.
"The chief question of all remains to be asked. Does _Gorboduc_, with all"
"its borrowed devices, _and because of them_, rise to a higher level of"
tragedy than _Cambyses_ and _Appius and Virginia_? To answer this
"question we must examine the effect of those devices, and understand"
what is precisely meant by the term tragedy. Let it be first understood
that the arrangement of acts and scenes is comparatively unimportant in
"this connexion, though most helpful in giving clearness to the action."
Marlowe's _Doctor Faustus_ (in the earlier edition) dispenses with it;
so does Milton's _Samson Agonistes_; and we have just seen that the
great Greek dramatists knew nothing of it. What is important is the
"exclusion of that comic element which, in some form or another, had"
hitherto found a place in almost every English play; the removal of all
action from the stage--for the Dumb Shows stand apart from the play--;
and the substitution of stately speeches for natural conversation and
"dialogue. Of all three the purpose is the same, namely, to impress the"
audience with a sense of greater dignity and awe than would be imparted
by a more familiar style. The long speeches give importance to the
"decisions, and compel a belief that momentous events are about to"
happen or have happened. In harmony with this effect is the absence of
all comic relief--although Shakespeare was to prove later that this has
"a useful place in tragedy. A smile, a jest would be sacrilege in the"
prevailing gloom. Two effects alone are aimed at; an impression of
"loftiness in the theme, and a profound melancholy. Not warm gushing"
"tears. Those are the outcome of a personal sorrow, small and ignoble"
"beside an abstract grief at 'the falls of princes', 'the tumbling down"
"of crowns', 'the ruin of proud realms'. What does the reader or"
spectator know of Ferrex that he should mingle his cries with Videna's
"lamentations? The account of Porrex appealing, with childlike faith in"
"saw it as a struggle between old and new, which, to him, meant evil and"
"good. In the advocates of tradition he saw only obscurantism,"
"conservatism, and ignorant opposition to _bonae literae_, that is, the"
good cause for which he and his partisans battled. Of the rise of that
higher culture Erasmus had already formed the conception which has since
"dominated the history of the Renaissance. It was a revival, begun two or"
"three hundred years before his time, in which, besides literature, all"
the plastic arts shared. Side by side with the terms restitution and
reflorescence the word renascence crops up repeatedly in his writings.
'The world is coming to its senses as if awaking out of a deep sleep.
"Still there are some left who recalcitrate pertinaciously, clinging"
convulsively with hands and feet to their old ignorance. They fear that
"if _bonae literae_ are reborn and the world grows wise, it will come to"
light that they have known nothing.' They do not know how pious the
"Ancients could be, what sanctity characterizes Socrates, Virgil, and"
"Horace, or Plutarch's _Moralia_, how rich the history of Antiquity is in"
examples of forgiveness and true virtue. We should call nothing profane
that is pious and conduces to good morals. No more dignified view of
life was ever found than that which Cicero propounds in _De Senectute_.
In order to understand Erasmus's mind and the charm which it had for his
"contemporaries, one must begin with the ideal of life that was present"
before his inward eye as a splendid dream. It is not his own in
"particular. The whole Renaissance cherished that wish of reposeful,"
"blithe, and yet serious intercourse of good and wise friends in the cool"
"shade of a house under trees, where serenity and harmony would dwell."
"The age yearned for the realization of simplicity, sincerity, truth and"
nature. Their imagination was always steeped in the essence of
"Antiquity, though, at heart, it is more nearly connected with medieval"
ideals than they themselves were aware. In the circle of the Medici it
"is the idyll of Careggi, in Rabelais it embodies itself in the fancy of"
the abbey of Thélème; it finds voice in More's _Utopia_ and in the work
"cause and effect, so unrelenting must be the sequence of failure and"
success. We shall find that the failure must be the antecedent power to
lie dormant for the long subsequent dynamic expression in what we call
success. It is then and then only that we shall begin to question
"ourselves which is the greater of the two, a noble failure or a vulgar"
success.
"As a concrete example, I shall relate the history of a noble failure"
which had its setting in this little corner of the earth. And if some of
the audience thought that the speaker has been blessed with life that
"has been unusually fruitful, they will soon realise that the power and"
strength that nerved me to meet the shocks of life were in reality
"derived at this very place, where I witnessed the struggle which"
overpowered a far greater life.
STIMULUS OF CONTACT WITH WESTERN CULTURE
An impulse from outside reacts on impressionable bodies in two different
"ways, depending on whether the recipient is inert or fully alive. The"
"inert is fashioned after the pattern of the impression made on it, and"
this in infinite repetition of one mechanical stamp. But when an
"organism is fully alive, the answering reaction is often of an"
altogether different character to the impinging stimulus. The outside
shocks stir up the organism to answer feebly or to utmost in ways as
multitudinous and varied as life itself. So the first impetus of Western
education impressed itself on some in a dead monotony of imitation of
things Western; while in others it awakened all that was greatest in the
national memory. It is the release of some giant force which lay for
long time dormant. My father was one of the earliest to receive the
impetus characteristic of the modern epoch as derived from the West. And
in his case it came to pass that the stimulus evoked the latent
"esteemed matrons to the Palatine, where, hailed by the cheers of the"
"multitude and surrounded by fumes of incense, it was solemnly installed"
"(Nones of April, 204). This triumphal entry was later glorified by"
"marvelous legends, and the poets told of edifying miracles that had"
occurred during Cybele's voyage. In the same year Scipio transferred the
"seat of war to Africa, and Hannibal, compelled to meet him there, was"
beaten at Zama. The prediction of the Sybils had come true and Rome was rid
of the long Punic terror. The foreign goddess was honored in recognition of
the service she had rendered. A temple was erected to her on the summit of
"the Palatine, and every year a celebration enhanced by scenic plays, the"
"_ludi Megalenses_, commemorated the date of dedication of the sanctuary and"
the arrival of the goddess (April 4th-10th).
What was this Asiatic religion that had suddenly been transferred into the
heart of Rome by an extraordinary circumstance? Even then it could look
back upon a long period of development. It combined beliefs of various
"origin. It contained primitive usages of the religion of Anatolia, some of"
which have survived to this day in spite of Christianity and Islam. Like
"the Kizil-Bash peasants of to-day, the ancient inhabitants of the peninsula"
"met on the summits of mountains covered with woods no ax had desecrated,"
and {48} celebrated their festal days.[1] They believed that Cybele resided
"on the high summits of Ida and Berecyntus, and the perennial pines, in"
"conjunction with the prolific and early maturing almond tree, were the"
"sacred trees of Attis. Besides trees, the country people worshiped stones,"
rocks or meteors that had fallen from the sky like the one taken from
Pessinus to Pergamum and thence to Rome. They also venerated certain
"animals, especially the most powerful of them all, the lion, who may at one"
time have been the totem of savage tribes.[2] In mythology as well as in
art the lion remained the riding or driving animal of the Great Mother.
Their conception of the divinity was indistinct and impersonal. A goddess
"of the earth, called Mâ or Cybele, was revered as the fecund mother of all"
"things, the ""mistress of the wild beasts""[3] that inhabit the woods. A god"
"also be contrary to humanity if they were to hang about, or to cause"
starvation of the men on board in mid-voyage on account of the mere lack
"of coal or food. Beyond this, the spirit of the law of nations is that a"
neutral ought to allow nothing. Can any one boldly assert that the
theory of asylum can be applied with fairness to a case like that of the
"Baltic Fleet, which is far from seeking asylum, but is deliberately"
endeavouring to administer coups to its adversary and proceeding to the
"very seat of war. If he can do so, where is the justice and equity of"
"the so-called law of nations, which the Occidentals boast of, not"
"without just title, and claim that it forms one of the essential parts"
of Christian morality?
"7. As to the talk about the three-mile limit of the territorial waters,"
there is already much divergency of opinion even amongst the jurists. To
put it forth as a defence in a case like that of the Baltic Fleet
"affairs seems to me too puerile. The matter, however, becomes all the"
"more grave when even that limit is not observed, and it has been"
constantly ignored by the Baltic Fleet.
Such are the views which we Japanese have taken in the matter. Some
French journals (erroneously basing their assertions on the views I have
personally expressed) say that Japan has taken up English views of
"international law in opposition to the Continental views, so that France"
ought not to yield to Japan's protest. This contention is not correct.
We do not hold these views because they are English ones: we do so
because they are in our opinion the only views which are
_internationally_ just and equitable. We are now fighting against a foe
"so formidable, as the whole world knows, that to us it is a matter of"
"life and death. We have sufficient patience and fortitude, but we cannot"
run the risk of sacrificing our very existence without some protest when
we think that we are not being treated with justice and equity.
"fast light cruiser, came in about a fortnight ago to have some defects"
"made good in her high-speed geared-turbines. There was not much wrong,"
but her engineer commander recommended a renewal of some of the spur
"wheels. The officers and crew went on short leave in rotation, a care"
"and maintenance party was put in charge, and the builders placed a"
"working gang on board which was occupied in shifts, by night and by"
"day, in making good the defects. When a ship is under repair in a"
"river basin, it is practically impossible to keep up the beautiful"
order and discipline of a ship at sea. Men of all kinds are constantly
"coming and going, life on board is stripped of the most ordinary"
"comforts and conveniences, there is inevitably some falling off in"
"strict supervision. Lack of space, lack of facilities for moving about"
"the ship, lack of any regular routine. You will understand. Just as"
the expansion in the New Army and the New Navy has made it possible
"for unknown enemy agents to take service in the Army and the Navy, so"
the dilution of labour in the shipyards has made it possible for
workmen--whose sympathies are with the enemy--to get employment about
"the warships. The danger is fully recognised, and that is where"
Dawson's widespread system of counter-espionage comes in. There is not
"a trade union, among all the eighteen or twenty engaged in shipyard"
"work--riveters, fitters, platers, joiners, and all the rest of"
them--in which he has not police officers enrolled as skilled
"tradesmen, members of the unions, working as ordinary hands or as"
"foremen, sometimes even in office as ""shop stewards"" representing the"
interest of the unions and acting as their spokesmen in disputes with
the employers. Dawson claims that there has never yet been a secret
"Strike Committee, since the war began, upon which at least one of his"
own men was not serving. He is a wonderful man. I don't like him; he
is too unscrupulous and merciless for my simple tastes; but his value
"to the country is beyond payment."""
"""But where in the world does he raise these men? One can't turn a"
"long as life lasted, so long did the heart continue to pulsate. There"
could be no effect without a cause. How then was it that these
"pulsations became spontaneous? To this query, no satisfactory answer had"
been forthcoming. Similar spontaneous movements were also observable in
"plant tissues, and by their investigation the secret of automatism in"
the animal world became unravelled. The existence of these spontaneous
"movements could easily be demonstrated by means of the Indian ""Bon"
"Charal"", the telegraph plant, whose small leaflets danced continuously"
up and down. The popular belief that they danced in response to the
clappings of the hand was quite erroneous. From the readings of the
"scripts made by this plant, the lecturer was in a position to state that"
the automatic movements of both plants and animals were guided by laws
which were identical. Thus in the rhythmic tissues of the plant and the
animal the pulsation frequency was increased under the action of warmth
"and lessened under cold, increased frequency being attended by"
"diminution of amplitude, and ""_vice versa_"". Under ether, there was a"
"temporary arrest, revival being possible when the vapour was blown off."
More fatal was the effect of chloroform. The most extraordinary
"parallelism, however, lay in the fact that those poisons which arrested"
the beat of the heart in a particular way arrested the plant pulsation
in a corresponding manner. The lecturer had succeeded in reviving a
leaflet poisoned by the application of one with a dose of counteracting
poison.
A time came when after one answer to a supreme shock there was a sudden
end of the plant's power to give any response. This supreme shock was
"the shock of death. Even in this crisis, there was no immediate change"
"in the placid appearance of the plant. In man at the critical moment, a"
"spasm passed through the whole body, and similarly in the plant the"
lecturer had discovered that a great contractile spasm took place. This
was accompanied by an electrical spasm also. In the script of the death
recorder the line that up to this point was being drawn became suddenly
"revealing substance to us, how do we know about God? We cannot form any"
"'general' impressions, have any 'general' knowledge; only a sort of"
conglomeration of unrelated or detached bits of knowledge can possibly
"come home to us. The fact is, that modern philosophy starts with two"
separate and self-existent substances; that it does not see how they
"can be combined, and that the 'white-paper' theory is so abstract that"
we can never arrive at self-consciousness by its means.
"Berkeley followed out the logical consequences of Locke, though perhaps"
he hardly knew where these would carry him. He acknowledged that we
know nothing but ideas--nothing outside of our mind. But he adds the
"conception of self, and by analogy the conception of God, who acts as a"
principle of causation. Whether there is necessary connection in his
"sensations or not, he does not say. Hume followed with criticism,"
scathing and merciless. He states that all we know of is the experience
we have; and by experience he signifies perceptions. Ideas to him are
"nothing more than perceptions, and whether they are ideas simply of the"
"mind, or ideas of some object, is to him the same. If we begin to"
"imagine such conceptions as those of universality or necessity, of God"
"or the self, beyond a complex of successive ideas, we are going farther"
than experience permits. We cannot connect our perceptions with an
"object, nor can we get beyond what experience allows. Custom merely"
brings about certain conclusions which are often enough misleading. It
"connects effect and cause, really different events: it brings about"
ideas of morality very often deceptive. We have our custom of regarding
"things, another has his--who can say which is correct? All we can do"
"is, what seems a hopeless task enough--we can try to show how these"
unrelated particulars seem by repetition to produce an illusionary
connection in our minds.
"Both mind and matter appear, then, to be wanting, and experience alone"
is suggested as the means of solving the difficulty in which we are
"One by one, as the characters of a cryptograph become explicit, the"
little signs left by the furnished room’s procession of guests
developed a significance. The threadbare space in the rug in front of
the dresser told that lovely woman had marched in the throng. Tiny
finger prints on the wall spoke of little prisoners trying to feel
"their way to sun and air. A splattered stain, raying like the shadow of"
"a bursting bomb, witnessed where a hurled glass or bottle had"
splintered with its contents against the wall. Across the pier glass
had been scrawled with a diamond in staggering letters the name
“Marie.” It seemed that the succession of dwellers in the furnished
room had turned in fury—perhaps tempted beyond forbearance by its
garish coldness—and wreaked upon it their passions. The furniture was
"chipped and bruised; the couch, distorted by bursting springs, seemed a"
horrible monster that had been slain during the stress of some
grotesque convulsion. Some more potent upheaval had cloven a great
slice from the marble mantel. Each plank in the floor owned its
particular cant and shriek as from a separate and individual agony. It
seemed incredible that all this malice and injury had been wrought upon
the room by those who had called it for a time their home; and yet it
"may have been the cheated home instinct surviving blindly, the"
resentful rage at false household gods that had kindled their wrath. A
hut that is our own we can sweep and adorn and cherish.
"The young tenant in the chair allowed these thoughts to file,"
"soft-shod, through his mind, while there drifted into the room"
furnished sounds and furnished scents. He heard in one room a tittering
"and incontinent, slack laughter; in others the monologue of a scold,"
"the rattling of dice, a lullaby, and one crying dully; above him a"
banjo tinkled with spirit. Doors banged somewhere; the elevated trains
roared intermittently; a cat yowled miserably upon a back fence. And he
breathed the breath of the house—a dank savour rather than a smell—a
"cold, musty effluvium as from underground vaults mingled with the"
misgiving. In contrast-dreams of this type we are not concerned with
the eruption of concealed and repressed wishes. They are merely based
"on vestigial possibilities, entirely alien to our temperament as it has"
"developed in life, and only a part of our complex personalities in the"
"sense that, as Schopenhauer said, whatever path we take in life there"
are latent germs within us which could only have developed in an exactly
opposite path. Even the very same dream may be due to quite different
"causes. To take a very simple dream, for we may best argue on the simplest"
"facts: the dream of eating. We dream of eating when we are hungry, but"
sometimes we also dream of eating when the stomach is suffering from
"repletion. The dream is the same, but the psychological mechanism is"
"entirely different, in the one case emotional, in the other intellectual."
In the first case the picture of eating is built up in response to an
"organic visceral craving, and we have an elementary wish-dream of what"
Freud would call infantile type; in the second case the same dream is a
"theory, embodied in a concrete picture, to account for the existence of"
the repletion experienced.
"There cannot be the slightest doubt that the wish-dream, in its simple or"
"what Freud calls its infantile form, represents an extremely common type"
of dream.[160] A large number of the dreams of children are concerned with
wishes and their fulfilments. Those dreams of adults which are aroused by
"actual organic sensations also tend to fall, though not invariably, into"
"the same form. Again, we chance to want a thing when we are awake; when"
"we are asleep we dream we have found it. It may also be said, almost with"
"certainty, that in some cases our dreams are the fulfilment of unexpressed"
"and unconscious waking wishes. Even the best people, it is probable, may"
occasionally dream of events which represent the fulfilment of wishes they
have never consciously formulated. Archbishop Laud was accustomed to note
down his dreams in his Diary. On one occasion we find him setting down
"a disturbing dream, in which he saw the Lord Keeper dead, and 'rotten"
already.' A little later we find that Laud is 'much concerned at the
ideal human society as a geometrical structure based on certain
well-defined postulates. All men ought to be able to satisfy certain
elementary needs of their nature; but all that is beyond is
questionable or harmful. The ideal legislator will curtail wealth so
as to restore the wealthy to their true nature--and so forth. Of any
generous outlook on the wider possibilities of human life there is
scarcely a trace. His essay is the apotheosis of social mediocrity. By
Procrustean methods he would have forced mankind back to the dull
levels of Sparta: the opalescent glow of Athenian life was beyond his
ken. But perhaps the most curious passage is that in which he preaches
against the sin and folly of ambition. He pictures Ambition as a
"figure with pallid cheeks, wild eyes, hasty step, jerky movements and"
"sardonic smile, for whom crimes are a sport, while lies and calumnies"
"are merely arguments and figures of speech. Then, in words that recall"
"Juvenal's satire on Hannibal's career, he continues: ""What is"
Alexander doing when he rushes from Thebes into Persia and thence into
"India? He is ever restless, he loses his wits, he believes himself"
God. What is the end of Cromwell? He governs England. But is he not
"tormented by all the daggers of the furies?""--The words ring false,"
even for this period of Buonaparte's life; and one can readily
understand his keen wish in later years to burn every copy of these
youthful essays. But they have nearly all survived; and the diatribe
against ambition itself supplies the feather wherewith history may
wing her shaft at the towering flight of the imperial eagle.[15]
"At midsummer he is transferred, as first lieutenant, to another"
regiment which happened to be quartered at Valence; but his second
sojourn there is remarkable only for signs of increasing devotion to
the revolutionary cause. In the autumn of 1791 he is again in Corsica
"on furlough, and remains there until the month of May following. He"
finds the island rent by strifes which it would be tedious to
describe. Suffice it to say that the breach between Paoli and the
"If this danger were adequately realized, it would be possible to rouse"
"public opinion, and to secure that a man’s beliefs should not be"
considered in appointing him to a post. The protection of minorities is
vitally important; and even the most orthodox of us may find himself in
"a minority some day, so that we all have an interest in restraining the"
tyranny of majorities. Nothing except public opinion can solve this
"problem. Socialism would make it somewhat more acute, since it would"
eliminate the opportunities that now arise through exceptional
employers. Every increase in the size of industrial undertakings makes
"it worse, since it diminishes the number of independent employers. The"
battle must be fought exactly as the battle of religious toleration was
"fought. And as in that case, so in this, a decay in the intensity of"
belief is likely to prove the decisive factor. While men were convinced
"of the absolute truth of Catholicism or Protestantism, as the case might"
"be, they were willing to persecute on account of them. While men are"
"quite certain of their modern creeds, they will persecute on their"
"behalf. Some element of doubt is essential to the practice, though not"
"to the theory, of toleration. And this brings me to my other point,"
which concerns the aims of education.
"If there is to be toleration in the world, one of the things taught in"
"schools must be the habit of weighing evidence, and the practice of not"
giving full assent to propositions which there is no reason to believe
"true. For example, the art of reading the newspapers should be taught."
The schoolmaster should select some incident which happened a good many
"years ago, and roused political passions in its day. He should then read"
"to the school children what was said by the newspapers on one side, what"
"was said by those on the other, and some impartial account of what"
"really happened. He should show how, from the biased account of either"
"side, a practised reader could infer what really happened, and he should"
make them understand that everything in newspapers is more or less
untrue. The cynical scepticism which would result from this teaching

ONE OF THE THINGS YOU LEARN IN TRAINING

"IF YOU HAD A ROUGH CHILDHOOD,"
A SITUATION WITH AN ABUSIVE FATHER AND A VULNERABLE KID

I've never met such insolence in my life!
"I come down here to get some lavatory paper, and she starts asking me the most insulting, personal things I've ever heard in my life!"
I thought she wanted writing paper.
"- I'm talking to you, Watt!"
- Watt?
Are you deaf?
I said I'm talking to you.
I've never met such insolence in my life.
She said people use it in the lounge.
"- Yes, she thought..."
- Then she starts asking me...
"- No, please listen..."
- Appalling questions about...
I can explain.
"No, you see, she thought you wanted to write."
Wanted a fight?
"- You know this is my block,"
- right?
"- No, what're you doing?"
- [screaming]
- I give you this space.
I help you set it up.
You want me to open a clinic?
Want Gavros to come back?
The Green Zone scout?
- I can't win.
- Of course you can.
- What's this?

Ah...
Red.
Ah!
Now.
- Na.
I did not remember what I wanted unfortunately.
- Something is other entirely.
- Oh see!
This is the trouble!
The start is very plain though.
"It would be necessary to think of it only, how you did the boxes before me arriving here."
"Ágika cut the cardboards, I folded."
And kind Tót what did he do?
- I got some air.
- Oh see!
Oneagainst one!
"I cut the cardboards alone though now, you though three people you make the folding,"
three against one.
"He has time to look at butterflies at night, to doze and you let your thoughts ramble."
- And why?
- Why?
- Why?
- Ágika?
"I believe it, because the our margin-cutting small."
Bravo!
For your daughter is golden mind.
"Thank you, Ágika."
"Is child's play, the others already!"
"Right, kind Tót?"
Yees!
- Good night!
- Good night!
He kissed me.
"You saw it, mom?"
Daddy!
Black.
Damn it!
What do you want?
"You're on leave, and the Gunzel case is closed."
Gunzel was no serial killer.
Not in the usual sense.
He was filling orders.
And not just for Hiromitsu.
Orders?
From whom?
Someone called lrezumi.
There are collectors...
Gunzel was just the tip of the iceberg.
There are others...
- Schrader!
Gunzel was in prison.
He couldn't have committed every murder.
If it was murder!
All 12 people with a Hiromitsu are reported dead or missing.
Come on.12
Has Gunzel's death been made public?
Tomorrow.
- We have to stop it.
Until we knowwho's behind it.
We?
"- Yeah, I wanna work the case again."
What's the lawyer's name?
Schoubya.
Frank Schoubya.
"Call me by my first name, since we're spending time together again."
I'll clear things with my superiors.

"Catherine, oh, I've always loved that name."

She wanted to warn me.
And later in the Beauty Salon she was lying beside me.
"""When you're warned, you must listen..."""
And she was at the cemetery this morning.
Mary is with me.
Mary is among us.
Mary is among us... in Vlissingen?

Castle and Hayley might be onto something.
Turns out that movie director was in New York during two of The Phantom's murders.
What about the third?
"Based on financials, there's no indication of where Austin was."
Which means he could have been here committing that third New York homicide.

Don't let Serena out of your sight.
Hey.
Look up.

- Look up.
What are you doing here?
Brother wasn't the shooter.
That was a decoy.
The brother was somewhere else.
It's worse than that.
DeBray was killed five days before
"Serena disappeared the first time, in a hitandrun."
I saw the footage.
"It was him, Nico."
DeBray isn't the one who's going to kill my baby.
The real killer is still out there.
It's not over.

"Are you saying that's why you hit him, or are you just commenting on his personality?"
I'm trying to help you.
This isn't your first complaint.
You already have a prior for fighting.

I do.

Yes.
You're a very attractive woman.
But I think we should just keep it as flatmates.

Follow me.
Hey.
Fleetwood's been checkin' in with his parole officer... doin' community service and scrubbing' graffiti.
Sumbitch is totally clean.
You?
I ran some of the names he had in his Palm Pilot.
He had four two-strikers in his address book.
You need a new C.I.?
–Doesn't everyone?
–I'm gonna hit the head.
"Then we can go do some arm twisting', huh?"
"–Vic, we need to talk."
–What's up?
Claudette's got Tio's ledger.
He was supposed to burn that.
"Well, apparently, Armadillo burned him first."
Claudette wants to run your financials against Tio's records.
Fine.
Let her.
–You sure?
–Trust me.
She's not gonna find anything.
–What's Joe Clarke doing here?
–You know Joe?
I remember his picture in the papers.
He can't be here.
"Hey, he's a friend of mine."
And he's also an embarrassment to this department.
You three are very punctual
"Jin Tianyun, the three of us... have nothing to do with you"

I thought I might take you up on that offer for some coffee.

- Sure.
Page me if you need me.
How many stitches?
"7 on the forehead, 5 on the cheek, 12 all together."
That's not so bad.
"Neela, this is Brad, Judy's husband."
"Hey, baby."
"- Honey, I'm so sorry."
"- Oh, come on."
It wasn't your fault.
The police told me what happened.
- What's going on?
A meeting to appoint a new principal.
- How do you know it'll be Ms. Thornton?
- Nobody else deserves it.
I'll drop by the store after school.
"Goodbye, Dad."
I wish you'd stop that ridiculous performance every day.
What?
Saying goodbye or hello to my father?
Saying it to a photograph.
"I suppose it's silly, but it makes me feel that he's here."
You scarcely knew him.
It's not my fault he died when I was two.
"I can't remember him, I admit, but I miss him."
"You mean, you miss a father."
"Yes, Mother."
"Wouldn't it be nice if you had men friends, or dates, or even marry again?"
"Stop talking about fathers, husbands and marriage."
You miss him more than I ever realized.
"I'm sorry, Mother."
I'll be late.
Forgot the speech.
"- Goodbye, Mom."
- Bye.
"- Good morning, Ms. Lancie."
"- Good Morning, Allison."

Bye.
May I offer you a drink?
A friend of mine was driving a Tsuru thinking that nobody knew him.
"He was kidnapped, I don't know how much he paid."
Now he drives an armoured Hummer with bodyguards.
"The dinner is ready, everybody to the table!"
"Mom, what's going to happen to Beto?"
Do you know where I can find a job?
Merry Christmas!
"Kids, before you open them, give the gifts to Beto and the maids."
"Here, Beto."
- Thank you.
"That's nice, what do we have here?"
A shirt and a watch.
- Terrific.
Are they from you or from your mom?
From Santa Claus.
- Santa Claus!
They're very nice.
Thank you for giving them to me and to Santa because he sent them.
What did he say?
"Here, give this gift to Beto?"
Yes.

"I received your letter, and loved the invitation."
I wish I could go with you to stay with your brother in Bahia.
Isn't he the fisherman who lives by the sea in the middle of a palmfield?
But I can't go now.
"School is back, and grandma won't let me."
"But on my vacations,"
"I want to see you, and Foguinho as well."
Can you write me back?
Can you tell me where the circus will be?
"Barbuda, I have something to tell you."
I remembered everything.
Everything.
At least I know now.
"And as the days go by, I get more used to it."
"Kisses, Maria."
"Come on Maria, you don't want to spend your life on a tightrope..."
"I like it, grandma."

Hello.
"- Hi, Gul."
How are you?
Where are you?
And you wouldn't consider this an emergency?
"Just give us 2 hours, and the notebook will be recovered by then."
Perhaps less than two hours.
Just one and a half.
"- Give me Academician Filip, please."
- Is it OK?
Filip speaking.
"Following a thorough evaluation of the situation the crew of the Adam 84 Expedition has decided, that..."
This is CWB.
This is the Central World Brain.
The connection is lost.
CWB is powerless in the matter.
"Well, what do you say?"
Where did she go now?
Eh?
Poochie!
Stupid Bernau!
Give it to him!
Are you scared?
You'll get some more tomorrow at school!
Just wait!
"What've they done to you, Adam?"
"Oh, it's just my shirt."
But they couldn't take the notebook from me.
What's so important to them about it?
Secret calculations.
It's not suitable for girls.
- Unless...
- Why are you so secretive?
Perhaps some girls could...
Adam!
Stop messing about!
It's true!
- Skinny dudes...
- My sister married down.
Seriously.
"Oh, ""married down""?"
We were just having this conversation.
"""Married down""?"
"No, chunky is like marrying...sideways!"
"[ Laughing ] ""Sideways."""
Ferrara:
"Like, ""drag race"" to me means something totally different to you guys, I'm guessing."
It's true.
"And I'm guessing ""tranny"" means something different to me than it does to you."
"What does ""tranny"" mean to you?"
"""Tranny"" means the transmission."
Really?
I think we need to get you a drag name.
"Oh, no."
You're in San Francisco.
"I mean, everybody has a drag name here."
Ready?
Wait.
We're naming her miss Tess Tosterone.
"""Miss Tess tosterone."""
You know what?
That's pretty funny.
You know what?
You should come in and check out the view.
I really...
I got so many other calls.
"I really can't, but you guys have been great."
"Yeah, whatever."
"Ah, lookie here."
Dr. Dapper in the men's room with the carbon fiber knife.
Happy Thanksgiving.
"How we doing, McGee?"
"Good, boss."
Bishop and Jake made their flight.
And I actually got a text from Tony.
"Apparently, Senior... missed his flight from London and neglected to tell him."
So Tony didn't have to be there?
Nope.
But he's gonna go back tomorrow.
Senior-- he never disappoints.
"And as for our giving thanks, would anyone care to join me for a celebratory cocktail?"
"On me, of course."
"Oh, then I'm in."
"Me, too."
Me three!
Me three!
Gibbs?
"No, wait."
Before that...
I have a better idea.
Snow angels.
I'll give you one.

Found something interesting on it.
What?
"All right, so according to Abby,"
Cutler used this phone exclusively to contact her.
Right.
But... look at this.
The last number Cutler dialed was to a different number.
Right.
And check out the time.
10:51.
"That's two minutes after the shooting started, which means that not only did Cutler not die instantly..."
He was alive long enough to place a phone call.
Let me see that.
Exactly.

AUTOMATED VOICE:
We're sorry...
Disconnected?
Yeah.
Probably a burner.
"Okay, so this guy, he takes two at close range, he's bleeding out."

Mom?
"Sweetheart, we could not be happier."
"Isn""t that right, Bobbi?"
"I told you she wouldn""t like it."
"I figured since it was your first wedding dress, it""d be perfect."
That dress is jinxed.
- Figures.
"- Cassie, wait."
"She""s gonna ruin this."
"She""s just dying to ruin this!"
"Mom""s got three kids and we all got different dads."
What did you expect?
- Tim would never cheat.
"- Cassie, your own dad""s a cheater."
"I know you love him, and Rick""s a great guy and all that... but he still cheated on Mom."
"Just like every other jerk she""s been with."
"Don""t worry, you can still call it off."
"You know Mom""s right."
You know in your heart it will never last.
There are still some people in this world that believe in marriage.
Whatever.
But I love him.
Does anybody in this family even care that I love him?
- You want a double-chocolate muffin?
- And how much is that?
May I have one to go?
I thought he was happy.
"L""m happy."
"Nothing can be done now, Kaabir."
I belong to him.
But Saiba belongs to me.
Maybe in another life.
Maybe this was destiny.
Father has asked me to get Jilaan's head.
Then take mine along as well.
My heart shall always beat with Saiba's name.
Have you ever heard your name in that Muraaki's heart?
"Muraakis only have courage, they don't have a heart."
Jilaan is a Muraaki.
He has as many wives as the wars he has won.
He must have done this hundreds of times.
He must be having hundred more Saibas.
- I have only one.
- Jilaan loves only me.
Is Saiba happy?
Then I shall learn to live.
Only Paathar will feel lonely.
"Don't forget me, Saiba."
[PRAYER]
Jilaan-Saiba.
Celestial lovers.
Muraaki!
Muraaki!
I am no ordinary thing.
Then what are you?

"No, no, no."
"No, no, no."
That's not how I roll.
Okay.
Uh...
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
Mr. And Mrs. Burke.
We will...
We will send somebody up right away.
Thanks very much.
Okay.
"Oh, and could you tell Maintenance to take a look at the shower door while they're here?"
I got stuck in there this morning.
No problem.
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
The shower door?
In the same shower door where Monica was stuck?
In the same bathroom where her ashes were flushed down the toilet?
You really are superstitious?
I just figured fixing a thermostat was beneath you.
Superstitious?
No.
Spiritual?
Yes.

Daddy?
Ralphie's dead.
"Ohh, I'm sorry."
"I'm so sorry, bubele."
"Shall we say kaddish for him, huh?"
"What's a ""cad dish""?"
Kaddish is a sacred prayer for the dead that will send Ralphie to a blessed life in Olam Ha-Ba where Hashem will welcome him.
"Please don't talk gibberish to our son, Jacob."
"Sweetie, ralphie died 'cause fish don't live as long as people do."
"We'll get you another one, okay?"
- Tie your shoes.
- I want...
I want Ralphie.
"Well, we'll get you a better one."
What is your problem?
All he needed was a hug.
You're late for the partner's meeting.
"Your shoes are polished, Mr. Myers."
I ironed your blue sea island cotton shirt.
Cufflink choices are here.
"Thank you, Rosalinda."
"Yesterday, I noticed you didn't eat your strawberries..."
I-I don't really like them.
"So, today, I put in bananas and peanut butter, okay?"

"- I'll do better, I promise."
Please give me a second chance.
"Please, please."

This will all be over soon.
This is a special day.

"Without complete honesty, the healing cannot take place."

Farewell!
Mr F.
"For god's sake, Fantômas wants to murder me?"
"Yes, but there is no date after your initials, then Fantomas has perhaps considered that your death was not essential."
It's still frightens me.
I thought you loved the danger?
"The danger, yes, but executions, no!"
"And finally, Bank:"
May 31.
And we are at May 31.
Of course it's the Barbey-Nanteuil bank.
Their deposit safes are in danger and also their lives.
He will act before midnight.
How do we play?
"I stay behind the scenes, you come into the scene."
Fantomas?
Please...
"The people need dreams or nightmares, but not us."
It is nonetheless true we are in danger.

"i mean, typical, right?"
he's such a little wussy.
"he couldn't even make it through one night at the clink, and it wasn't 'cause he was shanked, either."
it's 'cause of a peanut allergy.
"[chuckling] i mean, what a lame-ass, right?"

"Hey, who you calling Matthew Perry, bitch?"
"I'm calling you Matthew Perry, you Matthew Perry-Iooking bitch!"
"No, there's nobody here who is Matthew Perry."
No one!
What is going on here?
"Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks that I have illegal narcotics on me... because I'm a minority."
This is textbook racial profiling... and I'd be more than happy to call the ACLU or the government--
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"Sorry for the inconvenience, sir."
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it.
"Thanks, Matt Perry."
"Why does everything have to become a huge argument with you, man?"

-It's good for an overview.
"-What, like a primer?"
"-Yeah, something like that."
"-Getting the basics, a light survey of popular culture."
-Are you teasing me?
-No.
Should I be reading the Journal of Medicine or the Harvard Review?
Would that be more appropriate?
-Something more scholarly?
"-No, come on, Al."
I was teasing.
"I could harass you about those porno magazines, but I didn't even bring it up."
Wha--?
Come on.
I don't care about the porno magazines.
-I just didn't know you liked Juggs.
"-Oh, God."
-Sorry I don't have enormous breasts.
"-Please, stop it."
Your breasts are fine.
Your breasts are perfect.
Really.
"Yeah, but who's had 72 lovers?"
Where did you come up with that fucking number?
I'm guessing from what you said.
"Well, I'm 16 years older than you."
That's a lifetime of fucking.
Are you all right?
"-Hey, you don't look so good."
-I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report in my dad's inbox.
He keeps everything.

"No, he's okay."
Take this to the ship.
What the hell was that?
You transmuted the molecular properties of the rifle.
What does that even mean?
"Okay, let's get out of here."
Kendra's down.
"Rip, we're kind of outnumbered here."
Fall back.
Staying here to fight Nazis is exacerbating the damage that we have already done to the timeline.
- But Kendra...
"- Is alive, thankfully, and we will rescue her in due course."
I hope.
- So this is a spaceship?
"- It's a timeship, but yes, it does also travel through space."

Aha!
Yes!

"He'll vanish from Bombay for good ifyou don't arrest him today,"
Halt!
There's nothing to panic.
Bombay's highly reputed criminal lawyer will fight Balwant's case.
"I got it, Mr Daaga."
Tomorrow is Sunday.
He will be bailed out on Monday.
Fine.
But I think it's difficult to free Balwant from this case.
What's the use of my fees if I don't free your man?
Rest assured.
I'll be prepared for the case.
"I hear, you and Inspector Vijay are vey good friends."
Absolutely true.
Our friendship dates back to our childhood.
We studied together.
Never mind.
"Mr. Rickman, can you hear me?"
"Now, don't move."
Just blink your eyes if you can hear me.
Thanks.
"Please, let this be a dream."
"I want a dozen double-stuffed Oreos, IV push... ready with 1,000 milligrams of peanut butter crackers and two amps of Nestle's Quik."
Good afternoon.
Hello.
My name is Christine Draper.
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Sally Druse.
Are you a good doctor?
As good as Dr. Hook?
No problem there.
Your hand's acting up?
Yeah.
Needles and pins.
And I need it for my pendulum.
I'm psychic.
I've been written up in several magazines.
Patient complains of needles and pins.
Noodles and prunes.
He's got one hell of a blood puddle in there.
I'm surprised the blow didn't crack his skull wide open.
"First, we open our craniotomy and then we excavate the haematoma."
"Capisci, Elmer?"
Yeah.
"Okay, there it is, Elmer."
I always pause here and imagine that I am the first neurosurgeon.
The first to boldly journey into the workings of a human mind.
Cool.
"Hey, Pastor, do you know that... some of these ruins are well over 2000 years old?"
"Yes, but in Philly we have the Liberty Bell."
"Malaparte, tomorrow I'll see the Pope."
There's one thing I want to know:
What is his favorite sport?
I don't know.
But maybe he plays baseball.
Very good!
"Cameras, move forward!"
"You know, there's something sad about victory."
Each goes his own way and nobody knows... when we'll meet again.
"Sometimes, when they do know, they hide."
"Not us, I hope."
Let's set a date to meet... after the war in Capri.
"You know, it's all set between Maria Concetta and I."
She goes to Cleveland with me.
We'll go to Capri first.
"You don't believe me, do you?"
"I believe you, Jimmy."
"No, you don't believe me."
"You'll see, I'll be back..."
- Malaparte!
- General!
What are those monuments over there?
Tombs.
Tombs of ancient Rome nobility.
Whose?
That's General Silla's.
That's Cicerus'.
That's Julius Caesar's.
- Julius Caesar?
- Yes.

"Can I do your back, honey?"
I`ve already done my back.
Can I do your front?
Go do your own front.
We should call Catherine and Eddie and tell them that we won`t be in until tomorrow afternoon.
"If we`re not there by 10:00 a.m., we`II be completely off-scheduIe."
I planned very carefully so we`d be at WaIIey world first thing Saturday morning.
"Sparky, I know how much this trip means to you and that you want all of us to have a great time, but it`s a Iong way to WaIIey world."
I think it`d be easier on all of us if you`d just try to relax.
"I`m way ahead of you, honey."
When did you get these?
I have my little secrets.
What a nice thought.
Don`t drink yet!
Ready?
I would Iike to propose a toast.
- How we gonna get there?
- Walk.
"Feet, did y'all hear what that man said?"
"- When my man appears, send him up with my luggage, will you?"
"- Very good, sir."
Show Mr. Wooster to his room.
"This way, sir."
Mr. Wooster just arrived.
I've given him room nine.
Good.
Keep me informed of everything he does.
I'm Mr. Wooster's man.
What room shall I take his things to?
- Mr. Wooster is in room nine.
- Thank you.
"- What's the matter, old man?"
Don't you feel well?
"- I'm very well, thank you."
- Have you got wasps in this hotel?
- Wasps?
Of course not.
- I feel certain I've been stung.
- Possibly your imagination.
"Possibly, but not probably."
- I'll carry that for you for two bits.
- Two bits of what?
That's a quarter— 25 cents American money.
"No, thank you."
I don't need your aid.
What an extraordinary language.
Two bits!

Your father and I were just discussing... how unrealistically space travel is portrayed in Star Wars.
"It was a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away."
- You either buy it or you don't.
- What a lively conversation. [Laughing]
- I'll get some sodas.
"- No, please."
Allow me.
Why don't you stay here and chat with Mr. Unrealistic Space Travel.
"Yes, I'd love to explain the practical impossibility... of the so-called light saber."

We're surrounded.

We'll shoot the viscount and throw them his body and demand their surrender.
Do we have enough ammunition to hold them off?

Ten bucks says the senator finally grants an interview.
"Yeah, with anyone but me."

I'm sorry I haven't been able to see you.

"Just take us through the logistics, Train Brain."
Okay.
Each of these blocks is a train car.
This is taking too long!
I need chocolate!

Sorry.
It's okay.

I can see us in there.
Just kidding.
We're not inside a block.
Tina!
Okay.
"The only time the door to the caboose in unlocked, is when Ethan makes a juice box delivery, every hour on the hour."
Every hour on the hour.
Sounds like a robot.

You guys are embarrassing me.

The chocolate is kept inside the chocolatier's refrigerator.
He's from Germany.

It also has a radio transmitter in its head.
How do we get them out?
I don't know.

This tendril wraps around the nearest major artery.
Try to remove them and they kill the host.
(ALL MURMURING)
CHRISTINA:
So what do we do?
Tori has to find a way to neutralize the disks before we do anything else.
EDGAR:
Or we could do the logical thing.
And we hand her over.
Nobody knows about this alliance.
We have to protect that advantage.

"That's kind of you, Doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first."
- 0h. 0K.
"- What business are you in, Mr Bernard?"
I'll be there later and perhaps we might have a drink together.
Come up to our suite.
We'll have a drink up there.
"- ln that case, I will take you to dinner."
"- No, no."
That's not fair.
I know Marrakech.
I can show you an Arab restaurant where the food is different and the manner of eating exotic.
That's what we came here for.
- How about one of those Arabian nights?
- l'd love it.
"How would you prefer to travel to the hotel, by taxi?"
"- Gee, I don't know."
- A wagon!
I wanna ride in a wagon!
I guess it's a wagon.
See you later.
Au revoir. I look forward to the cocktails.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

No.
Why not?

Me?
Never.
"But a report is useless, he has to change."
You know what Mattia VoIpe's real problem is?
He's crazy in love with you.
Not a chance!
"We were togetherfor a year, this is all I have left."
Why did you break up?
"He never says no, not even to his mom, he neverrisks anything."
I got mad and put him to the test.
I told him I'd asked to transfer.
And what did he do?
"Nothing, sir!"
- Mr. VoIpe?
- Mr. Director.
What is it?
You want to report me again?
Why don't you talk to yourmother?
.
- Why?
- Maria told me everything.
Mind your own business.
Okay.
Then behave properly during work hours.
Cocaine will never resolve personal problems.
What cocaine?
The cocaine you use when you make deliveries.
I saw you open that bag.
- Mmm-hmm.
Randy?
"Psychologically, we need to connect with somebody."
- Could be.
Jill.
Because we're culturally preconditioned?
"Good answers, but too intellectual for me."
"I think it's because, as some of you already may know, while it does last, it feels fucking great."
That's why.
Thank you.
Thank you.
"I'm halfway through my meal, and you haven't even started yet."
The perfect bite.
Mmm.
You need a therapist.
"Rose, do we have to have the television on?"
Can't we have a civilized conversation?
I know I'm not as intellectually stimulating as some of you university people...
"Okay, I'm sorry."
"How was your day, Mother?"
- Who gives a shit?
- I said I was sorry.
Let's talk.
I've lived too long.
"I should be dead, not having conversations."
"You stop it, please."
Give me that!
Talk to me already!
All right.
You haven't even noticed I had my hair done differently.

It looks great.
This notebook is the work of a genius.
He was just 17.
And a prodigy.

Go after for what?

All within 18 months.
Maybe there is someone to go after.
That was me.
My mouth was open.
"More importantly,"
I finally have enough bars on my phone to stalk Randy on Snapchat.
"Oh, great!"
"All of our problems are solved, except for food, money, and a place to sleep."
So negative.

"I wanna tell how I came to know Mr. Catchings, the man I killed."
I wanna tell this so my son will know.
Mr. Catchings was the overseer on the cotton plantation in Georgia...
... wherel slaved with my wife and children...
... 1 9 yearsago.
I don't need to say how bad life was to a slave.
We worked from sunup to dark.
We got whip.
We got sold.
We ain't had no hope.
But this is what I need my son to know about what I did.
When our little boy was 7 year old...
... hismama...
... wasforcedintocarnalrelations with Mr. Catchings.
What Mr. Catchings told her was that if she didn't...
... he'dselltheboy awayfrom us.
Seven years old.
He'd sell him away from his mama and daddy.
My wife...
... couldn'tbearthethoughtofthat.
So she went to his bed.
When she found out she was in a family way...
... shewasso afraid it would be that man's baby.
She lost her mind.
Walked into the river.
Drowned herself.
I would have killed Mr. Catchings then.
But me and the children was loaded on wagon in chains...
"... thatsameday,soldtoAlabama."
It took a lot of spirit out of me.
And I hope my son understands why now.
So you see...

"Oh, no."

Think about it.
When exactly did Felix string himself up?
The night after the party?
No.
The night before his big brother came home.
"Truth, Felix..."
Who were you afraid of?
Who made you so fucking scared that you'd rather die?
Than have him find out what happened.
"Show me with your eyes, Felix."
Show him.
"What's this about, brother?"
It was meant to be a fucking joke.
A little prank... to teach my lazy arse boyfriend a lesson
"I was drunk, Felix was willing."
A little too willing.
That's what this is about.
Isn't it?
He hanged himself!
My dad's company went down the pan a few months ago.
"Not that you'd give a toss, Justin!"
But I thought that just maybe the Hautbois family could help out.
"I sent Felix an email... very polite... wondering if, uh, he could talk to his family about refloating my dad's company."

There's no Portuguese anything.
How'd we end up with Portugal?
I was working during the sign up.
"By the time I got there, the only country left was Portugal."
There's a Portuguese family in the class and even they picked Jamaica.
"Ritchie, come on."

We're supposed to dress like our country.

A good person?
I believe he can be.
"Besides, who are we to judge?"
We all sin.
"I'll answer for you, Charles."
"He can be a good person, but he chooses not to be."
How's Kisan any different than dealing with Sutton or Jared?
"We don't need any more distractions, Charles."
- We need a title.
"- And Teague can help us get there, sir."
- I really believe that.
"- The answer is no, Charles."
"But it was a very impassioned pitch, so je vous remercie."

Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
Yep.
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."

holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water."" AII died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
people are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
What's the matter now?
I think Grandma would Iike it not too spicy.
May I start eating?
(girl grunting)
She's tethered!
Someone is hiding her here.
"Travis most likely, sir."
Alright.
You must have stumbled upon her lair.
You approached her.
"She felt threatened, so she attacked you."
Should I bring her back to the cells?
"No, no."
The Toronto Asylum under Dr. Ogden's care will be best.
Right.
"Do you think she's the killer, sir?"
Certainly seems capable of it.
I'd have to agree.
Alright.
(Fen grunting)
"Fen, I'm going to put you to sleep for a little while."
(indistinct chatter)
(Dr. Ogden exhales.)
My goodness!
Hard to believe it's the same girl.
Her persona was very much exaggerated.
Her hair and body unwashed...
That's quite a scar.
Yes.
From an animal attack some years ago.
Mr. Travis claims that she was mauled by a wolf.
"It's quite possible, William."
Her teeth have been deliberately filed down into points.
I took an impression.
It matches our victim's bite mark.
-
"- Oh, aye."
Nothing to choose between them!
"Then I thought, ""Colour the hair, Granville."
"-- ""Get into colour."
"Loads of colour."" -"
- They're not really great legs.
"Then I thought, ""Maybe"" -- and I'd appreciate a second opinion --"
"""Maybe something plain."
"Severe, even."
"""Something discreet, in the shape of a single earring?"""
"Oh, yeah!"
Yeah.
Isn't that lovely?
"Oh, d--dear!"
Look at her!
That's the k--kind of advertising we need!
-
- Have you got any copper?
-
"- Oh, yes."
"One pound, thank you."
There we are!
"I'm making a study of the adverts in these glossy magazines, Granville."
There are two things that stand out.
Her two things c--certainly stand out!
But where are we going to get someone like that round here with these qualifications?
"No, who would d--dress in a c--costume like that and p--p--pose like that?"
-- (TILL BANGS) -
- Aghh!
"Oh, dear."
He'll never get the hang of that!
Ok.
"Let's wait 2, 3 weeks."
All right.
"And the lies she's been telling, that's part of it, huh?"
Lies?
"Like saying her bed's shaking, that stuff?"
"Have you ever known your daughter to swear, to use obscenities?"
"No, never."
Hmm.
Interesting.
Similar...
"Similar to things like her lying, it's uncharacteristic for her--"
I don't understand.
She doesn't swear.
"Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil."
I find that hard to believe.
What did she say?
Her vocabulary is rather extensive.
"Well, give me an example."
Like what?
"Specifically, what did she say?"
"Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her..."
Goddamn cunt.
I can't believe it.
Oh.
"Now, she-- you don't think a psychiatrist?"
No.
I think the best explanation is always the simplest.
"Well, we'll wait."
We'll wait and see.
Ok.
"So, in the meantime, try not to worry."
[gun shots]
Watch your back.
Right.
Cover me!
[gun shots]
The other two got away.
They got andreas.
Edward mace is unrelenting and ruthless.
When he discovers he doesn't
"Have what he came for,"
He will be back with a vengeance.
Where will they take andreas?
To the darkest place on earth.
I have to go after them.
(nigel:)let's see what we've got here.
The scabbard has holes along its length
That coincide with words written
On the inside of the blade.
Makes up a latin phrase.
"""from sarsen stone, 240 peds,"
"Beneath the druid's noch."""
"(syd:) ""peds."""
Is a roman measurement common to the time.
"Yeah, the stride of an average man."
It would have been about
Five-foot-two in those days.
Sarsen.
"Sarsen is a type of limestone,"
Indigenous to south- central England.
"Also known as greywether,"
Or druidstone.
It's what stonehenge is made of.
"-You're the only voter i care-- -l'm getting that """"con"""" feeling."
-Like you're copping a plea.
"-No, come on."
No plea.
I'm just a pol who kept rolling along until he ran into a stone wall.
You were that wall.
And I realized...
... justlikeme whenIwasa kid .
"Young, ambitious, go-getter, but fair."
"Trading up, but always for the right causes."
You're doing good.
Not putting money in your pocket.
Just trying to maintain your position.
Your power.
What good are you to the people without it?
But down deep...
... youknowthere'saline you can't cross.
And after a thousand trades...
... andonedealtoo many...
... thelinegetsrubbedout.
"I had the fire in the belly just like you, Kevin."
"And the odd thing is, I still have it."
Never left me.
I had the dream...
... andI hadtheweight.
Like one of those guys before me said:
"""""lf a sparrow dies in Central Park, I feel responsible. """""
Well said. I feel that way.
I was gonna take that feeling with me...
... allthewaytoWashington.
The things you could have done.
Fucking things I could've done.
Because you're kaputt.
Get this guy out of my hair so I can go.
To the kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
"Why, I'll kill you for that!"
Shut up.
"Security officer, huh?"
Always screening everybody.
"Only, who screens you?"
"Great American hero, from Cleveland, Ohio."
Enlisted right after Pearl Harbor.
When was Pearl Harbor?
Or don't you know that?
"- December 7th, '41."
-What time?
Six o'clock.
I was having dinner.
Six o'clock in Berlin.
They were having lunch in Cleveland.
"- Am I boring you, boys?"
-Go on.
"He's a Nazi, Price is."
"For all I know, his name is Preissinger or Preisshoffer."
"Oh, sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back like a good little Bundist."
"He spoke our lingo, so they sent him to spy school and fixed him up with phony dog tags."
He's lying.
He's trying to get himself off the hook.
- He said shut up.
-You heard what he said.
"Okay, Herr Preisshoffer, let's have the mailbox."
The what?
The one you took out from the corner of your bunk and put in this pocket.
Let me show you how they did it.
(GEESE honking )
(GASPS ) sir.NMiss Kingsleigh is distracted today.
Where's your head?
I was wonderingNwhat it would be like to fly.
Why would you spend your time thinking aboutNsuch an impossible thing?
Why wouldn't I?
My father said he sometimes believedNin six impossible things before breakfast.
(SOFTLY) Come along.
meet me under the gazeboNin precisely 1 0 minutes.
(faith EXHALlNG EX ClTEDLY)
We have a secret to tell you.
Nthen it's not much of a secret.
-Perhaps we shouldn't.N-We decided we should.
she won't be surprised.
-Will you be surprised?
N-Not if you tell me.
Nyou have to.
we won't.
I wonder if your mother knows that you two swim nakedNin the Havershims' pond.
but I would.
There's your mother right now.
Hamish is going to ask for your hand.
You've ruined the surprise!
I could strangle them!
Everyone went to so much effortNto keep the secret.
Does everyone know?
It's why they've all come.NThis is your engagement party.
Hamish will ask you under the gazebo.NWhen you say yes...
But I don't knowNif I want to marry Hamish.
then?
NYou won't do better than a lord.
Alice.NThat pretty face won't last forever.
How is that thing?
"If somebody, like, does a little flick to it,"
Will it-- blow on that sign and see if it blows over.
[Blowing]
MAN:
Did you guys dig deep?
LLOYD KAUFMAN:
"The astrological signs are down,"
But the signs are up.
Cold pizza after 10 hours of straight shooting.
It was cold pizza.
INTERVIEWER:
"Well, if you'll remember, the first five hours"
"Today, we didn't shoot at all."
It wasn't your fault.
"Yeah, but food is not determined,"
"Like, by how footage we shoot."
INTERVIEWER: [laughs]
It's usually determined by how long the day goes by.
INTERVIEWER:
"How's the experience been so far, Mike?"
"It fucking sucks, man. [laughs]"
"I'm sleeping bad, losing 20 pounds a week."
MAN:
"Oh, that's not [inaudible]."
"Yeah, actually, I need to lose the weight."
So it's all right.
INTERVIEWER:
So you love Troma?
I love Troma.
I'm excited to do the next one.
[Laughter]
"""A broken smile beneath her whispered wings""."
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
What do you look like?
It depends on who's looking.
I want to meet you.
"You already have, John."
I have seen you afraid.
"You're afraid right now, aren't you?"
Can... can I ask you something?
"Why ask me what you already know, John?"
When?
Why?
What happened to my wife?
You were there.
Mary Klein cannot be found by looking.
You will see her in time.
Gordon!
"What's up, Connie?"
Everything okay?
Did you just call John?
No.
I've been asleep since 9:00.
"Unless, of course, you're Gordon Smallwood."
See?
"It's sticking up here around 1,950 cycles per second."
"But it never gets any lower than maybe 1,930 or so."
"But yours is way down here in the normal vocal range... anywhere between 1,000 and 1,200 cycles per second."
"Okay, so this guy's vocal range."
is much higher than mine.
What makes you think it's a man?
"Still more proof, John Klein?"
He was not the looked for element.
You remember this place?
Of course.
I'm not brain-dead.
You used to bring me here every Sunday.
We'd get strawberry milkshakes.
Yeah.
With extra whipped cream.
"Yeah, and you'd always let me eat yours."
Yeah.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
"So, what did you wanna talk to me about?"
You.
"Uh, let me guess."
"Ok, you hate my hair,"
"My clothes, my friends..."
Sarah--
How I'm ruining my life.
"Sarah, I'm here because I wanna understand what happened."
I just wanna know how you and I ended up like this.
I don't know.
It just happened.
"Listen, I understand that the problems between your mom and I didn't or haven't helped the situation, but..."
Can we-- can we just order already?
All right.
I'm just trying to understand here.
"Well, you never do."
You just believe what you want.
"Well, maybe you do that, too."
What can I get ya?
"Uh, two eggs, over medium."
Multigrain toast.
"Uh, I'll do the mushroom and cheese omelet, please."
- Throw things at him!
"- Stop, or I'll arrest you all!"
You watch it!
- What about my theatre?
- Reporting for duty!
Moron!
- What about my theatre?
- Moron!
"Friend, tell me if you see anyone who looks suspicious."
There's a monetary reward.
Useless bum!
"Koon, there's a murderer with a painted face."
He might be in the troupe.
You must watch out.
Really?
- Where is he?
"- In this mess, who knows?"
We just recruited someone.
He has a funny walk and...
"OK, I'm coming."
"When the show's finished, look for me front of house."
I'll tell you.
I hate people from Bo Chi Lam.
Now you're their prime suspect.
We can work together.
You help me to...
"If you're successful, I'll pay for your trip to Nan Yang."
You won't have to worry about the police for the rest of your life.
But I'm afraid that you're no match for Wong Fei-hung.
LONGEVITY
"Congratulations, congratulations!"
- Have another drink!
"You can't touch me, Sheriff!"
I brought my attack dog with the built-in force field.
"Well, I brought my dinosaur who eats force-field dogs."
"Yipe, yipe, yipe, yipe!"
"You're going to jail, Bart!"
Say goodbye to the wife and Tater Tots.
"You saved the day again, Woody."
You're my favourite deputy.
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
"Come on, let's wrangle up the cattle."
When the road looks rough ahead
"And you're miles and miles from your nice, warm bed"
"Round 'em up, cowboy!"
Just remember what your old pal said
"Boy, you've got a friend in me"
Yee-haw!
"Yeah, you've got a friend in me"
"Hey, cowboy!"
Some other folks might be a little bit smarter than I am
Big and stronger too
"Come on, Woody."
Maybe
But none of them will ever love you the way I do
"It's me and you, boy"
And as the years go by
Whoa!
Whoa!
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see It's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
All right!
"- Before you picked me, you didn't tell?"
- No.
- I always assumed...
- No.
Well... .
Let's go see our boss.
- Hey.
- How was the NGA?
"Oh, you know the governors, too many mandates, too little money."
- I can hear that one at home.
- Good one.
- The governors liked it.
- Yeah.
Have you announced for the governor of New Jersey bill?
- Excuse me?
- Did I miss an announcement?
That's three years away.
I'm trying to serve...
I never heard of these loans.
So I'm assuming it's a campaign proposal.
Camden and Newark will go nuts.
I know it's not national.
- Give me a break.
- Know how I know?
National programs are announced by the president unless this White House passes on them first.
"Toby, this is a nickel-and-dime program."
Calm down.
Right.
We're announcing a new replacement for Social Security...
- I thought we were...
- They're not your nickels.
- They're not your dimes!
Madam!
Why is this house locked?
Who are you?
Whom do you want to meet?
"Gardener, why is this house locked?"
Where is sir?
Who?
Mr. Kumar.
"Oh, you mean him?"
He was really nice fellow.
Its been long since he has left this place!
Where did he leave for?
"I dont know, sir."
But afterthis mansion was auctioned..
..nobody saw him around here!
Auction?
"Yeah, now Mr. Dhanraj owns this mansion."
Dhanraj?
!
And what about his family?
His brothers?
They were not brothers but rather brutes.
And now they have become quite rich.
They have started factory with help of those auction money!
Both of the brothers have taken away all the money.
Mr. Kumar and his younger sisterwere..
..thrown out of this house!
They have left this house as if they were leaving this world!
But why did he agree to all this?
Why did he put up with their dishonesty?
Why did he leave silently?
What could he do?
- ...
I'm arresting you on suspicion
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!
"You do not have to say anything, but if you do not mention..."
Agh!
Help!
(SHRIEKS) Help!
What did I do?
Didn't find any drugs!
"Search me, I don't take drugs."
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?
- (MOBILE BUZZES)
- Can you shut up for one second?
- I'm clean!
I'm clean!
I'm clean!
- Justin.
Did you get a beat on that DNA?
"Er, yeah."
"Cameron Pell, artist."
"Well, failed artist."
A history of mental illness?
No.
The man's got serious issues.
Five years back he was arrested for gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.
"He's burst in wearing a clown mask, slashed a load of paintings with a flensing knife."
"When they tried to throw him out, he's gone completely Tonto."
Cut up two doormen.
Lucky to escape an attempted murder charge.
- Right.
"I'm sorry, sir, no visitors."
TRIP:
You let me in before.
I have new orders from Major Hayes.
"Look, T'Pol was a little rough with me during the last session."
I think she caused some nerve damage.
MACO:
You'll have to speak with the Major.
This is a Starfleet ship.
I don't have to ask Major Hayes for anything.
MACO:
"Step away, sir."
REED:
"Stand down, Corporal."
The Captain gave Hayes control of the Bridge... posted macos on every deck.
-Is he still on the surface?
-Yeah.
Retrieving him and the antimatter should be the priority.
I'd advise securing the Bridge first.
If Hayes gets wind of this... we could have a fire-fight on our hands.
"Perhaps we should approach the Major, and explain the situation."
-He seems like a reasonable man.
-That would be risky.
"If Hayes sides with the Captain, this mutiny will be over before it begins."
We'll need more people.
Who's on duty in the Armoury?
Ensign Walsh and two of my men.
"They'll side with us, but Hayes posted two MACO there."
-Take the shuttlepod back to Enterprise.
"-What about you, sir?"
You heard me.
REED:
What's going on here anyway?
An old man was buried here yesterday.
"Last night, somebody dug him out and chopped him up."
We've been looking everywhere for his head.
Sometimes I don't understand the world anymore.
How did you last this long?
My family.
"No matter what,"
"I went back home, and everything was okay."
Can I ask you something?
They say you found that hit-and-run driver.
"Yes, I found him."
"An insignificant state employee, living in a row house."
I went into his bedroom at night.
He was alone.
I woke him up.
I wanted him to knowwhy.
It was pathetic.
He cried like a baby.
I just couldn't do it.
Sometimes I drive past his house at night when I can't sleep.
He got married last year.
Has a daughter of his own.
"If somebody always pays, who paid for your wife's death?"
I did.
I paid for it.
Now let's go afteryour Mr. Schoubya.
Mr. Schoubya.
Chief Inspector Minks.
"My colleague, Officer Schrader."
Thank you for seeing us at such shortnotice.
We have a few questions.
Goodbye.
Tell me of this Isabel Porter.
- She is weak... timid.
Narcissistically concerned with petty trivialities.
Unable to express her true self.
- And do you wish to return to your life as Isabel?
- No.
I have to forget I was ever such a vapid creature.
- Very good.
You are tabula rasa incarnate.
Do you understand the significance of what we've achieved?
"- Yes, sir."
"Thank you, sir."
- You are ready for your new identity.
"- Hello, good man."
"I'm sorry to disturb you at this late hour, but is Mr. Baxter in?"
- No.
I'm sorry.
He's out.
"Was he expecting you, Mr..."
"- No, sir."
I was in the area and thought I'd call on him.
- My apologies.
Perhaps you could call on him another time?
- Certainly.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
"- My sweet, pretty wife."
"Dost thou doubt me already, and we but three months married?"
- More.
Your Faith doubts you.
- Then God bless you.
tomorrow afternoon's edition.
Just in time for the congressman to make his statement... and just in time for it to stick in the minds of Americans over the weekend.
Wh...
What's the source?
Where'd they get the story?
- Unnamed sources close to the investigation.
- I see.
Al.
- Al!
- Yes?
"We can, um..."
Let's...
"Let's dot the I's, cross the T's on this one later."
"All right, thank you."
"I, uh..."
I think I have some self-righteous indignation coming my way.
"Well, is there any truth whatsoever to the story?"
- There will be an investigation.
- She's gonna have the truth on her side.
- She's gonna deny it and make us all look like fools.
- Let her.
Let her deny just that part of the story.
- Hold here.
- What?
Oh.
That's all right.
I can do that myself.
Yeah.
Thank you.
- America Live is not in the circus business.
- Pete's always fair.
Should I hear anything in this?
Addons Then came Max.
He has destroyed more than 30 sites.
Addons like to work hard with his hands.
"You do not kill Max, is not it?"
You do not kill Max.
"You kill the wrong people, stupid."
Addons you kill the wrong people.
Addons But do not worry.
One to capture the real Max.
Addons soon.
Addons And he will suffer.
"Addons Now, where are we?"
Addons Alan was very funny.
"Addons We all know this is nepolitico and, but you, Jo ..."
Addons you Inga what do you do?
Addons Enough ...
You look.
Addons - really like to see ..
- I'm drunk.
Addons I hereby apologize for anything.
You become pregnant.
Addons A pathetic excuse for your life miserable.
"But even so self-centered, to see my son die?"
Addons
- What have you done with my daughter?
- Meriþi not a girl.
Addons The only thing you should do it the waters and the panic button.
You killed my mother.
Your family and pilot and the innocent people you killed.
Addons you sweep the floor with my daughter Lucy.
Addons This is a service of destruction for the people.
Ace knows not receive anything.
"Uh, yeah, well, I'm dressed."
"Oh, good."
Let's get this show on the road.
Okay.
[men singing on TV continues]
"Good night, Billy, I hate you."
- I hate you too.
- I hate you three.
Have a terrible time.
[men singing on TV continues]
"Good night, Billy."
[men yip and holler on TV]
"Good night, Mike."
[bell ringing on TV]
"[Taterbug] Come on, will you, start this resignation."
"[Jim] No, no use, Taterbug, that kid's got to get his schooling, that's all there is to it."
[Taterbug] We could find a place in Dusty Bend.
"That's the town near the Circle J Ranch, where we'd be workin'."
"Listen here, old partner--"
"But not tied down like a couple of old women, cooped up"
"- in an office, and for what?"
- [babysitter sighs]
"For an ornery, no-account brat of a kid."
Would you like some chocolate?
Sure.
Thanks.
"[Jim] That's just what he is, an ornery, no good, interfering brat."
"[Taterbug] Hey, look here, you got no right to be talking"
- about Buddy like that.
- [Jim] Haven't I?
"[Jim] Say, listen, I'll put him in an orphan's home."
"That's what I'll do, that's just where he belongs."
"Yeah, really."
"You've been dropping a lot of cash lately, McGee."
"New phone, new watch, new teeth."
What's up?
GIBBS:
Ducky matched the dental records.
The body downstairs is Lance Corporal Finn.
"Ziva, when did you...?"
McGee  how long does it take to put on a clean shirt?
Ten seconds.
"With buttons, a little longer."
Rhetorical question.
Contractor's off the hook.
He's been out of town for a week.
Going to check on the real estate agents this morning.
That's all you did?
No.
"While you and McGee were watching the sunrise,"
I was pulling Lance Corporal Finn's SRB.
And I would have to say it was spotty.
He was Unc' on the range and failed his swim qual.
So they made him a supply clerk.
Right.
"Six months ago, he signed out on a three-day pass before deploying to Iraq and never returned home."
- Get me his C.O.
- He's in Iraq.
I'll contact MTAC.
"I put in a request for Finn's bank records, earning statements and medical records."
TONY:
Night wasn't a total loss.
ground radar picked up a shovel about ten feet from the gravesite.
Already sent it to Abby.
"Almighty Lord, word of God the Father, Jesus Christ God and Lord of all creation who gave to your holy apostles the power to tramp underfoot serpents and scorpions."
Grant me your unworthy servant...
-...pardon for all my sins...
-Bastards!
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
See the cross of the Lord.
"Be gone, you hostile power."
"-O Lord, hear my prayer."
-And let my cry come unto thee.
-The Lord be with you.
-And also with you.
Father.
"I cast you out, unclean spirit!"
"-Shove it up your ass, you faggot!"
"-In the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ!"
It is he who commands you!
He who flung you straight from heaven to the depths of hell!
-Fuck him!
-Be gone...
"Fuck him, Karras!"
-...from this creature of God.
Be gone!
"In the name of the Father, and of the Son and the Holy Spirit."
"By this sign of the Holy Cross, of our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns with the Father and the Holy Spirit."
Damien!
Amen.
"God, defender of the human race look down in pity...."
You killed your mother!
You left her alone to die!
-Shut up!
-She'll never forgive you!
- Shut up!
That's when I felt a burning in my back and I knew he bit me.
I never saw him do anything like that.
Maybe he knew his mother was gone.
Maybe he did it to show his grief.
"Maybe he would've bitten himself, had he been alone."
We don't know.
We don't know how he thinks.
"Maybe he understands, but it's all stuck inside, and can't come out with words."
Poor polo...
What's gonna happen to him?
Where will he end up?
"'Twenty years old, a heart filled with hope and dreams"
'He comes to buy 'a few roses still in bud
'The flower girl is pretty
'Iost in the first bIushes
'He's unsure of himself when he gently tells her:
"'Give me some roses, 'mademoiseIIe"
"'I have a "" rendez-vous"""
'It's very important
'Choose them for me
'Among the more beautiful ones
'Give me some roses
'She loves them so.
Goddam tragedy!
Goddam gun!
Why did I leave it with her?
Goddam son-of-a-bitch.
Fine... you can go.
Thanks.
You hurt yourself?
It's nothing.
A stupid thumb-tack over there.
- Nothing?
The very time when you should have.
We call that dumb insolence.
"Bring the lamp closer, carpenter."
- There is a trace of worm.
- I thought you should know.
Nothing a little whitewash won't cure.
It might make its way to the midshipmen's berth.
You should look.
If you think it important.
Somebody being taught his manners?
"Overdoing it, isn't he?"
- That will do.
"- Aye, sir."
"All right, get up."
- What is he being punished for?
- Cutting his initials on the table.
- Where is this trouble you mentioned?
- Chapman!
All I see is a patch of uncoated timber.
Is that all?
"I thought you should see, sir."
- The wind's freshening.
- Why have you reversed my orders?
- Sir?
- I wanted the gallants set.

"You judged, Mr. Scott-Padget?"
You judged?
- It's good seamanship.

I want only Flora Enterprises to get Umbrella Creations' order.
For that we will have to make such designs that Umbrella Creations..
..signs the next 10 years' agreement only with our company.
"Don't worry, sir."
We will try our best.
Not try.
Results.
Definitely.
You are working so hard.
It's very late.
Go to sleep.
Coming.
I will just finish this and come.
Okay?
Hey.
- Hey.
I will see you.
- Yeah.
The designs.
What is this?
Along with your time why are you wasting our time as well?
But have a look..
If our company starts working on the sketches made by you..
..we will even stop getting the few contracts that we have got.
Unbelievable!
Hey.

And you do not like your mom.
- And I do not even.

So who removed the wire from Bob Keaton ?
I don't know.
Still searching.
Just switched over from a local criminal database.
"Okay, take your time."
"H, I've been thinking about this crime scene."
"The wire, the scene being processed..."
"It's above my pay scale, isn't it ?"
Maybe all of ours.
Who's this ?
"""David Park."""
This guy's not a criminal.
He's a GS-14.
David Park has government clearance.
Let's have Homicide bring him in.
"Thank you, Eric."
Mr. Park.
Yeah ?
My name is Lieutenant
Horatio Caine.
Caine.
"Yes... now, I understand you work for the federal government."
Census Bureau.
I count people.
"Now, a GS-14 clearance is a little high on the food chain for a census taker, don't you think ?"
"Again,"
I count people.
"Well, I guess that could explain why I recovered your fingerprint from my victim."
And that would also tell me that you removed his surveillance wire.
So that's how you tracked me down.
You get used to me.
You funny.
- You...
- In here.
What's the status of your crew-served weapons?
"We have two 81 s, four 60s twelve .30 calibers, three on each wall."
One 4-deuce.
"Besides crew-served, we have six M-79's."
No .50 calibers?
I'd give an R and R in Bangkok for the smell of a .50.
KIRBY:
"You hear that, sergeant?"
"- Yes, sir."
- Know where there are any .50's?
MULDOON:
"No, sir."
Neither do I. You better tell Sergeant Petersen.
I almost forgot.
Captain MacDaniel needs corrugated tin.
- It's been hard to come by lately.
- Sergeant.
"Yes, sir."

"""Tell Petersen."
"Tell the scrounger."""

What happens if Charlie hits this camp before you get it completed?
"If he does, and he's too strong for us to handle we have 3 LZs within 4 clicks to send 10 choppers each to reinforce us."
One is by that shale cliff you saw on your way in.
And the second is to the west of here near a deserted Montagnard village where some of these people used to live.
"The third is to the north, near an old bridge."
What if Charlie overruns the camp?
That will allow me to climb up into the air ducts.

Then she is the mayor of this beautiful village.
"Well, I have no other choice, so I'm the mayor."
It is a big responsibility because I love these people and I want them.
I want...
That they are happy.
It is difficult to understand what happiness is.
It is not conditional.
You can not say:
"""I will be happy if I have this, if..."""
"When you say 'if', it means you're not happy."
"That's why we're all happy here, hear 'yes'."
"I heard from somebody here in this beautiful country,"
She did the stuntman.
"Yes, I was the stuntman coordinator, but it's just one of my professions."
I'm black karate belt and I have the fourth level of Shotokan.

I'm a diving instructor.

Jenny?
- Yes?
- Hey.
You gotta hear this.
I was checking out Samir in our system.
"- What, he has a rap sheet?"
"- No, but Jenny does."
- Jenny?
- She was picked up a few weeks ago in the garage of Samir's office.
- No kidding.
- I checked with the arresting officers.
Samir told them that Jenny had become obsessed.
"He slept with her, but she became delusional."
Thought that they were having some sort of a love affair.
"What, so the entire relationship was in her head?"
That's nuts.
She's been stalking him for months.
"Begged us to keep quiet, didn't want his wife to find out."
- Which means what?
"- Look, our fox screen shows the wine Samir was drinking was laced with tranquilizers."
"Olivia did not have the presence of mind to drug him, Bo."
She's not our killer.
I think we have bigger problems.
Yeah?
Bo?
I found the head.
There's a note.
"""Beloved, I've taken steps to remove the obstacle between us."
Join me at the farm.
"We'll start our life together."""
I know.

"Okay, this is going to sound a little weird, and I know it's going to sound a little weird, okay?"
[Inhales deeply]
Here goes.
I can see things that--
That what?
That most people can't.
"You mean, like, ghosts?"
No.
No.
Not the dead.
"Well, that's good."
"Look, apparently, my ancestors from Germany, the Grimms, well, I guess I'm related to them."
My mother's side of the family had the same ability.
What kind of ability are we talking about?
See these books?
They're filled with drawings made by my ancestors and some other people who had the same ability.
"And the drawings are of Wesen, which is how they like to refer to themselves."
"Who, the Grimms?"
"No, the Wesen."
And that's what I can see.
What the Grimms could see.
And there are all kinds of them.
They're kind of like species that exist within us-- some of us.
"Anyway, there's Blutbad and Bauerschwein,"
"Fuchsbaus, Eisbibers."

I never realized how heavy these were.
"K.C. inducted engines, twin carbs."
Just touch that throttle and boom!
It's like gettin' a chick off.
- That wasn't your sales pitch.
"- Oh, yeah."
You actually said that to people?
"Well, you know, just, like, biker types."
Huh.
"Hey, Russ."
Checkit out.
I don't believe it.
I thought you called for partly cloudy and pleasant tonight.
A backdoor cold front.
- A what?
- A backdoor cold front.
Rare.
Almost impossible to predict.
The atmosphere - a beautiful yet fickle beast she is.
Is that from the Evel Knievel play?

-Have you had a chance to talk at all?
"-Well, we did meet at the hospital."
-Did anything good come out of it?
"-No, nothing."
-You didn't say anything to each other?
-We said things to each other but we weren't talking.
-We're saying things and that's all nice and sweet.
-Nice and sweet is good.
-He's misses the summer cabin.
He doesn't miss me.
-He's got passion in his eyes when he's changing a goddamn roof tile.
-Dad loves you so very much
"-In fact, he loves you so much it almost killed him."
-I'm not getting any younger.
I want to live.
-What the hell is that?
-Is that a dating site you're showing me?
"-They're pretty handsome, don't you think?"
"-Well, they look like dad, all three of them."
"-No, I don't think so."
-They definitely do.
These two are sea captains and the third one works for the Maritime Administration.
-I must have a thing for sailors then.
-This is not happening.
"-But you know what, none of these guys have summer cabins."
-Is that the problem?
Is it the house that's the issue?
"-There you go, dad."
Finally back at your favourite place.
"-Are you comfortable, dad?"
He pretty much built Newcastle about 100 years ago.
I knew that.
"Local knowledge, John."
"Can't beat it, eh?"
The dead man's obviously got a sense of humour.
He was interested in how the city was built and then he names himself after two different blokes who are known as Mr Newcastle.
"I'll just go and, er... chase up those choccy biscuits for you, eh?"
"~ Still irritating you, then?"
"~ Teeny bit, yeah."
"~ (Lab report, sir.) ~ What?"
"He's lost his voice, sir."
"He's got a cold, or flu, or summat."

Three skull fractures.
Injuries to the legs and upper body.
Injuries are consistent with a heavy blunt force.

"- Thomas, please."
"- Okay, I heard rumblings of strange occurrences many years ago, but they are mere rumours, nothing more."
"- Thomas, you would tell me if there were reason to be concerned, would you not?"
"- Yes, of course I would."
Of course I would tell you.

The father was a Soviet diplomat who lived in Paris for five years... and then immigrated to America in 1968.

You're a cop.
That's evidence.
You think it was a coincidence that guy was Russian?
Who knows what Mikhail was involved in.
Sebastien... what happened to my brother could've happened to me.
Thirty-two years ago it was only luck that kept me in France.
He made a sacrifice and never knew It.
I gotta go.
The killer did not know Mikhail is dead.
You go to New York with that face and-
Maybe he isn't.

"Take you, for instance."

Mrs Lightman!
Mrs Lightman!
Father Brown.
From the party.
Did you see Henry?
I didn't get to see him.
The police stopped me.
But you knew he'd been poisoned?
Two policemen woke me up this morning asking me if I'd been near his shed.
You must have been very angry with Henry last night.
Why on earth would I want to poison him?
"He can't help me clear Thomas if he's dead, can he?"
No.
You mentioned being in prison?
"On the morning they hanged Thomas, I attacked a policeman."
Oh.
"No, well,"
I wouldn't have expected someone like you to understand.
"Look, all I know about Henry Lee, all I care about, is that he was the last person to look into my son's eyes."
"Morning, Constable."
Father.
Shame to throw away such a handsome volume.
"""For Henry,"
"""the greatest of hangmen, the greatest of men."
"Ever, Max."""
You didn't know that your friend Max was Vera Blanchett's killer until Iris told you last night.
You came home and threw away his gift in disgust.
"Henry, I am only trying to get to the bottom of this."
Max was a senior judge...
..at the Crown Court where Vera Blanchett was a secretary.
He took his own life... ..not long after I hanged Thomas.
Now I know why.
Oh!
"Well, get yourself a drink."
You need a drink.
"Well, I shouldn't, probably."
"I've already taken, like, all kinds of strange things before coming over here, so I don't know."
"- Good, you'll be able..."
- You look very put together.
You handle your things well.
"I do handle them well, but..."
"I'm speaking of allergy medicine in this case, 'cause upstate really fucks with me."
"All right, have yourself..."
"All right, have yourself a merry little Christmas."
I'll be right back.
- Good to see you.
- It's an honour.
- Sit down.
- Thank you.
Sit down.
What are you doing in here?
- They said they want you to come back.
- You fucked up.
- Huh?
- Get back in there.
I could have made that transaction in two minutes when I was your age.
Twice a week.
Fucking get back in there.
"Well, it's my understanding that was a different time."
"Women were, you know..."

"This full moon, this water, the shadows..."
"Jilaan, Saiba, such love..."

Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.
Here..
I die for you.
No!
'A stormy sky...'
'A ferocious moon...'
"'Bodies meet, bodies perish.'"
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Saiba was never yours and shall never be.
Nature shall repeat this story.
Today love has bled into water.
Then there's no lover greater than me.
'If they do not make it through the ocean of fire...'
'One last breath would forever remain a desire.'
'Saiba was mine...
and will always be mine.'
"'No trust, no love.'"
'Here...
I die for you.'
"'Souls meet, they together forever flourish.'"
Karma.
Things come back to you.
They repeat.
What had happened will repeat.
"Only you can change it, Saira."
You were mine and shall always remain mine.
Kaabir.
Which is exactly what the Nazis are looking for.
What does this Ark look like?
Uh...
There's a picture of it right here.
That's it.
Good God.
"Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought."
"Uh... now, what's that supposed to be coming out of there?"
Lightning... fire... power of God or something.
I'm beginning to understand
Hitler's interest in this.
"Oh, yes."
"The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains, and laying waste to entire regions."
An army which carries the Ark before it... is invincible.
"You did it, didn't you?"
They want you to go for it.
"Oh, Marcus!"
They want you to get ahold of the Ark before the Nazis do and they're prepared to pay handsomely for it.
And the museum?
The museum gets the Ark when we're finished?
"Oh, yes."
Oh...
The Ark of the Covenant.
Nothing else has come close.
That thing represents everything we got into archaeology for in the first place.
Mmm!
"You know, five years ago, I would've gone after it myself."
I'm really rather envious.
I've got to locate Abner.
I think I know where to start.
Suppose she'll still be with him?
"Possibly, but..."
"Sifu, please be seated."
- Show me.
Where is the discomfort?
- My whole body is uncomfortable.
"Allow me, Wong Fei-hung, to help you."
"Wong Fei-hung, I can't take pain!"
I've already beaten up a few bonesetters!
"Your blood flow is blocked, and your pulse is weak."
"Sifu Wong, is there a cure?"
Sifu Wong has a cure for everything.
Everything flows smoothly now.
"Sifu Wong, you're incredible."
Anything wrong?
"My friend, you've not only dislocated your shoulder, you have internal injuries as well."
Are you pulling my leg?
Feel your ribcage.
Do you feel any pain on the sixth rib?
- No.
- No?
It could be further down.
I felt the pain.
That's not all.
You have problems breathing as well.
You're right.
You've been training too hard.
These injuries are inevitable.
Irregularities in breathing can be cured by Yin-Yang flame-cupping.
"After I unblock the flow of ch'i, you'll feel better."
Does it hurt?
"No, it doesn't."
Yin flame.
The suction's very strong.
Don't move.
You're not going to shoot me.
Tell me something else about myself.
"I swear that I will, but not now."
"(Machine gun fire, screams)"
-Silence!

-Relax.
Outside is taken care of.
and I will sort this out in a jiffy.
"Let's see, do any of them speak Spanish?"
"-Yes, this one."
"Well listen carefully, because this is the last time I'll say it,"

Do you understand?
-And you understanding this?
"No, it's not going to be over that easily."

Do any of them have a connection to AUTEC projects?
Lawrence Ridgeway.
"He wasn't the man with the gun, but..."

You are afraid.
"Meanwhile, Mr Fantômas has not returned for four years."
I'm superstitious.
"Come on, you're going to Mr Thomery's bal later."
Exactly.
Mr Thomey was ill-advised to give up this bal barely a few days after the tragic death of my friend the Baroness de Vibray.
I tried to dissuade him.
-l'm tight.
-Your pectorals are okay now...
"... butyoudon'tworkthem , in 5 years, they'll be at your knees."

"-What are you, mid-30s?"
No reason for it.
Doesn't have to be that way.

"You wanna sit on a butt like cottage cheese, be my guest. I'll sit on this."
"You got to admit, lieutenant, the guy's got a hell of a muscular ass."
"Hey, detectives?"
That's Dee Dee Santini's mother.
"-Sorry for your loss, Mrs. Santini."
-My name's McBride.
My daughter's name was Santini.
"At 1 6, she married a punk named Santini."
"This is my Dolores, and she'll always be McBride to me."
Let's sit down.
"Come on, sit down."
"-What can we do for you, ma'am?"
-l want to show you some things.
This is her high school graduation.
Get out of here.
- Oh.
Now.
"Sorry, I just wanted to show my boyfriend my fake shoes."
- Now!
- She's pregnant.
What?
Ah!
- Pregnant?
- It worked.
- Where you goin'?
- My shoe!
Oh!
"Well, they clash with my dress anyway."
"You know, I was thinking... we could do some vacationy things... when we go to D.C."
You know?
Make the most of our trip.
Where's my lockpick set?
"You know, maybe a fancy dinner one night, take in some of the sights."
I'm gonna confront a man who tried to have me killed.
"It's not a weekend getaway, Fi."
- We can mix business with pleasure.
- It was right here.
"Fi, the thing about D.C.-"
Is that you're going to need backup.
Don't tell me you'd rather have Sam.
- We can't talk about this right now.
- Why not?
Because I have a hard time focusing when I'm in handcuffs!
Would this help?
Another fine illustration of your need for tactical assistance.
"Admit it, Michael."
"Not a single fingermark, sir."
"There are traces of blood, but it's been deliberately wiped clean."
Had to be Travis.
- The girl wouldn't have the wherewithal to do that.
- Exactly.
"But then, what about the bite marks?"
"Well, the victim got too close to her."
"As you discovered, Fen reacts violently when approached."
Indeed she does.
So the victim and the girl were involved in an altercation.
Or Travis set her on him.
"Either way, Travis stabbed him and then tried to cover it up."
But why?
"Any news from the victim, Crabtree?"
"Nothing yet, sir, but I've widened my search, sent out a province-wide description."
Constables.
"Come with me, I've found the killer."
"""Constables."""
See.
I got it.
A vicious coyote.
- And he's the killer?
- He is indeed.
Ah...
"So, uh... explain to me how he could use that?"
- ♪♪♪ - (Fen panting)
- (indistinct chatter) - (distant woman):
Bye-bye!
Julia!
This is a nice surprise.
- How are you?
- (Baby babbling)
What are you doing?
!
Are you alright?
Let me go!
What's this noise now?
Doc..!
Me..!
it's Yu..!
What are you doing here?
I'm saved.
Doc?
Yes.
number one Spriggan.
It can't be...
Is he really?
Oh man.
I heard about your life being targeted.
Chief Yamamoto in Tokyo has been worried about you.
How hasty of you to run away from the hospital and to use Arcam's private jet.
Here.
It's the latest in armored muscle suits.
It's made partly of fibers of a metal called Omihalcon.
That battle suit was created by mixing metal Omihalcon fibers with an artificial muscle structure that is resistant to both heat and pressure.
It enables the user to draw more than 30 times as much power as is normally used.
how long has it been since we've taken any vacation?
was about two years ago.
This is a fighting knife also made of Omihalcon.
With a knuckle guard!
What's this?
Arm pad with wire anchor.
with a strong climbing claw.
Wow.
I'm going to climb Mount Everest.
Bike across Death Valley.
I'm going to eat my weight in garbage.
Why would I want to waste my indestructableness on business?
See?
I told you overreacting would work.
"Harvey, stop fidgeting."
Try and look like we're having a good time.
I feel like all we're being judged on is how we look.
How do I look?
Gorgeous.
Now will you stop asking me that?
Stop yelling at me.
Nobody's going to vote for us if it looks like we're fighting.
But do I really look okay?
"Okay, I'm sorry."
Let's just dance.
Got to go.
"Dreama, have you seen my camera?"
"No, but you can use mine."
"Look for it, please."
Something tells me this is about more than a camera.
Thank you for helping me back here.
My pleasure.
I was feeling a little disoriented.
"Ooh, I wonder if I could scurry up those curtains."
"Come on, Hilda, let's go."
Call the elevator.
I'll be right there.
(chuckling)
I'm beginning to think you have a problem.
"And now, the moment everyone's been waiting for."
Please remain calm.
Please refrain from going near the windows or doors.
Deactivate.
Commence emergency shutdown!
We are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition.
"You know, somehow "" I told you so"" just doesn't quite say it."
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.
This is your final warning.
Return to your homes immediately.
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots because they would protect us.
"Every time one attacked me, that red light was on."
-The uplink to USR.
-It's Robertson.
-Why?
It doesn't make sense.
-I don't know.
I just need you to get me into that building.
"Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced."
Let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
"Return to your homes, or you will be consequenced."
Why doesn't that boy listen?
-I need you to get off for a second.
-What?
-Just aim and fire.
-What?
!
Wait!
-You have been deemed hazardous.
"-You can kiss my ass, metal dick!"
Brother llango...
How many more are there?
Call any number of men.
This will be their fate.
You said I can't come alive.
I have come alive.
You said I can't save my father and my people.
I have saved them.
You said Konda Reddy is the King of Cuddappah.
But now I stand on his dead body.
You said whether I am real man.
"Yes, I am real man."
"To me, you're just a corpse."
If any Konda Reddy or Gocha comes here
I will slit their throats.
Stop.
"As you said, you have saved your father  your people."
No one can cross Cuddapah.
I've framed your people as naxalites.
"Courier, I woke up when you killed Cuddappah Raja."
We jailed your father as a naxalite.
"Just 5 minutes, I changed everything."
"To free the head of terrorists, police station vandalized."
Terrorists attacked police and escaped with arms  ammunitions.
How is it?
No inquiry for naxalites.
Encounter straight away.
It's our men.
Hey Inspector.
We got the shooting order.
Don't listen to anyone.
Just kill them all.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Staring... with wide eyes at the sky.
"After that, he was possessed by the eye."
He could see nothing else.
And he kept drawing that picture.
I can't forget that eye either.
No other eyes are as frightful as that eye.
"The moon also glitters, but it's not frightening."
Moonlight is nice.
"Yes, it was on a night just like tonight... a strange thing happened..."
Stop it!
Don't tell us any scary stories anymore.
I never told... you a scary story.
"When I was in the kitchen, I heard a feeble voice saying:"
"""Hello, hello. """
I heard a feeble voice.
I looked... and saw a strange boy poking his head in.
"He said, ""Your Suzukichi... """
Suzukichi again?
"""Your Suzukichi was drowning in the pool..."
"""so I pulled him out..."
"""and carried him here."
"""I put him on the grass over there. """
This was what the little boy said.
He was a skinny little boy.
"And sure enough, he was soaking wet himself... with water still dripping from his hair."
I was so shocked.
I rushed out to see.
I saw...
Suzukichi lying there.
I am certified to this state as a Supreme Court judge...
... andyou'resittinghere rearguing a 2-year-old case.
"You're out of line, and I'll so inform the mayor."
I'm here on the mayor's behalf.
You think I've slept the last two nights?
Don't you realize I know what a mistake I made?
That's it.
Satisfied?
No basement or anything?
"You saw it, the rumpus room."
With the pool table?
"That's right, captain."
I'm only doing my job.
I'm very sorry--
"Oh, sorry, crap!"
You're snooping around like a Nazi.
Please.
You know this is the last thing I wanted to do.
"Then get the hell out of internal Affairs, and get an honest job."
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You gotta do something about Eddie's pension.
They're gonna reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox..."
... hereathissummercottage in Ulster County.
Emergency Service Unit workers... .
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
Which of these two do you prefer?
I don't know.
Try them both.
One for each window.
"Don't be silly, darling."
It's as much your problem as it is mine.
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.
My den?
"What's this, Sergeant?"
Buying a trousseau?
We're buying curtains.
"I thought it was for underpants, the kind civilians wear in the tea business."
Will you two leave and stop annoying Tommy?
"I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off to Tantrapur in 20 minutes... and Tommy's marching with us."
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...
"Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss."
"I grieve to say, Miss, that the man is a tower of pain."
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?
"Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!"
- Tommy.
"- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss."
"Tommy, these friends of yours have engineered this behind your back."
"Don't cry, darling."
Goodbye.
This is May 9.
"I'm going with you for five days, and good company I'll be... but at sunset on May 14, when my time is up... wherever we are, I'm going to knock you two apes' heads together."
Now come on.
"- Pardon me, madam."
- Fall in!
"[laughs] Yeah, you mean, whenever Seth would let me."
Bought you a souvenir.
"Aw, shucks."
It's everything I ever wanted.
"Everybody needs their Shangri-La, kid."
- You ever see that YouTube video?
- YouTube?
"- What, are you watching YouTube now?"
"- Yes, I am."
"And they got this one, shows this dog, he runs right out in traffic, right out in the middle of the freeway, cars and trucks comin' from every angle, just to save the other dog's life."
"Okay, YouTube is a masturbatory wormhole."
The point of the story is  he does whatever it takes to save his pal.
Like nothin' else in the world matters.
Nothin'.
Whatever happened to that Seth and Richie?
[phone vibrating]
"You know he's not going to answer, right?"
He knows you betrayed him.
"I'll talk some sense into him, all right?"
Show him we can all do this.
"You really think you can live happily ever after with him, don't you?"
I can sure as hell try.
[phone beeps]
- [Seth] Yeah.
- Seth?
!
Seth.
"- Hey, listen to me."
- It's okay.
I know why you did it.
Just meet me back at Uncle Eddie's.
"Okay, you got it."
I want the boss.
"""Tattooing"" in Japanese..."
Take it nice and slow!
You lied to me.
All your questions about Lynn's tattoo.
She was killed for her tattoo.
What about you?
Did you tell me the truth?
I thought there were 12 Hiromitsus.
I wish it were so.
You were together?
You and Hiromitsu.
I loved him.
So much I didn't care that love meant something different to him.
We were so happy.
Until his masterpiece was finished.
He lost interest in me.
He lost interest in everything.
In life as well.
He killed himself.
Attained absolute perfection.
And left me behind with a wound that won't heal.
"Ironically, I'm the only thing that's left of him."
So Lynn Wilson knew about your tattoo?
"Of course, but she swore never to tell anyone about it."
Before ending up in Gunzel's basement.
Gunzel most likely knew about her tattoo and whoever else worked with him.
"Irezumi, too."
Who else knows about it?
Your family?
Your lover?
No one.
How the hell could you think it's okay to sleep with a teenage girl?
!
I don't know what you think you've heard...
Are you calling my wife a liar?
You know damn well what I'm talking about.
"I'm giving you a dignified out, Wallace."
Take it.
"I have to make this official, sir."
Is that your wife?
Amanda McNeil?
I've got to get out of here.
I understand.
You don't understand a damn thing.
"Sir, Amanda's body surfaced in connection with Sara Collins disappearance, so I need to know where you were Tuesday night."
"Uh, fixing the irrigation in my orchard."
Did you have any company?
Yeah.
Peaches.
Does that count?
"Look, I don't have an alibi."
- Is that what you want to hear?
"- No, not really."
Look...
I've lost my wife...
I've lost my friends...
I've lost my city.
"Look, Agent Kelton, you do what you want."
I've had enough.
It must be quite a change to go from running a city to running an orchard.
Do you ship the peaches right after harvest?
Why?
I'm just wondering if you have a refrigeration system on your property.
I live next door to you.
Right there.
"Just so you know, I can't be your friend."
...Why not?
That's just the way it is.
who said I wanted to be your friend...?
!
god!
what am I supposed to do?
to go out in there and do it myself?
Huh?
what?
answer me
maybe I'm getting slow
maybe I want to get caught... maybe I'm just tired
excuse me can I get through here?
"As some of you may have heard, there was an incident last night and one of our recent graduates was killed..."
"I want assure you that everything possible is being done to find those responsible for this tragedy, but in the mean time we should all be on the lookout for any suspicious activity..."
Your safety is our number on concern.
"it's you again, huh?"
"You know, I really wanna be left alone.."
Me too.
So leave.
You leave.
I've lived here longer than you...
What is that?
...This?
It's a Rubik's Cube.
You don't know Rubik's Cube?
Is it a puzzle?
Yeah...
Wanna try?
-The moon is an artificial construct.
it is a base where Alpha Draconians and other races have been manipulating human perception by means of a projected signal.
"In your way of understanding, they've hacked into the human consciousness."
They programmed exactly what they want you to see.
-Corroborating the stories that NASA adopted photos of bases on the moon's dark side.
-The role of NASA in this deceit is greater than you imagine.
-Stop right there.
-You know it's coming.
You know we're gonna lose.
It's inevitable.
What do you think you're gonna do?
What do you think you can do?
I'm a human being just like you.
"-No, you're not."
-Are you there?
-Yes.
-He... took our baby.
-I know.
I'm so sorry.
-Where are you?
-I'm coming to you.
-Aren't you going home?
-No.
-But they'll...kill you.
Please... stay away.
-I can't.
"-If I don't hear from you again,"
I love you.
What will life be like there?
-Harmonious.
Tranquil.
Our planet is a single continent.

# Under my skin #

What are you doing?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Something's wrong with you.
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gotta sit you down in this chair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.
"Of being shivved for being a traitor, you lying grasser!"
"I'm shutting you down, mate."
Put down the proto baby.
Now!
We tried to unplug you nicely even though we knew that you beamed your video to Akan.
No?
What's this?
What's that?
Sorry.
"Sorry, Artie."
"It's, uh--that is really cool."
"oh, thank you."
We try.
- You--you made this?
- In record time too.
With the help of-- things.
This is a copy of the finest samurai sword ever forged.
"The Honjo Msamune,"
Owned by the ruling family in Japan for centuries
Before it disappeared.
The real one unearthed a few weeks ago
At a dig site in Okinawa.
the real one.
Which does what?
Which will arrive in D.C. first thing in the morning
In order to be presented as a gift to the president.
But it's not going to happen because you two
Are going to intercept it at the Japanese embassy.
- that wasn't what I meant.
"- no, I know what you meant."
But you've got to pack.
and you got to catch a plane.
"And it really doesn't matter, does it,"
What the real sword does?
"Because, remember, ""snag it, bag it, and tag it?"""
"Well, get snagging, bagging, and tagging."
You're off to swap Masamune for an Artie Nielsen.
- Arigato.
- Bitte schön
- What is that?
- Classy.
"But if you tip him enough, he will have sex with you."
_
(sportscaster speaking indistinctly)
"(chattering, shouting indistinctly)"
- Look at him.
- Just... behaving as if nothing ever happened.
"The best relationship he's ever had is over, and he's just sitting there eating hot wings."
And I'll bet you Colleen is just drowning in tequila right now.
That's not racist.
"No, no, Latinos can swim."
Do we know what happened?
"Yeah, it's the same thing that always happens."
"He meets somebody great, they want a commitment, he freaks out, and then he dumps them, like an idiot."
Yeah.
And he told you that?
"No, he told me to mind my own business."
Wow.
Rude.
Oh.
(Jen clears throat)
"Hey, honey, uh, what has Matt told you about the breakup?"
Oh.
"You know, I wish I could tell you, but can't... bro code."
"Yeah, you don't remember, do you?"
"Uh, maybe he said he was sad."
JEN:
Mm-hmm.
Or fine or maybe happy.
You're a good listener.
Thanks.
"(indistinct shouting, cheering)"
-I think he means....
-I know what he means.
The answer's no.
"It's a man, okay."
His name's Derek.
He works in the library.
He's been so kind and helpful to me... with my reading... and opening my mind to all sorts of new possibilities.
"We both know it, Stephen, I failed."
"As a wife, as a mother."
"And, right now, I just badly need a change of direction in my life."
"The truth of it is, so do you."
"For God's sake, you deserve better than me, you deserve...."
I'm sorry.
"Look, perhaps it's best if we just...."
"Sorry, Gil."
-Have you got a minute?
-Hi.
"Actually, you know, I was just off to location."
Is it important?
My mother has left all her money to you.
-You're saying she changed her will?
-Two weeks before she died.
Had it all properly redrafted and witnessed at the home.
Without saying a word to you guys?
"I'm sorry, I'm very confused here."
"As are we all, Gil."
"That my mother-in-law in what has been legally confirmed as a ""sound state of mind"""
-should bequeath her entire estate....
"-We're talking about GBP1 7,000."
"""To Mr Gil Raymond, of 1 5 Carpenters Lane, Larch End,"
"""for picking up my spoon."""
"God, that's...."
She seduced me with Herman's picture.
Who are you talking about?
"About Christine, doctor."
Christine Halslag.
She's a witoh.
Everything checks.
She even has a numb spot on her back like the witohes in the middle ages.
It all connects.
Keep on talking... about witohes.
She killed them all!
Don't scoff at the poor girl's misfortunes. I've known her for years.
Those were tragic accidents.
Especially for her.
But these things happen!
Four accidents in a row is damn strange!
Use your head!
One plus one is still two!
Alright.
Then let me tell you how a physician sees you.
You turn a dead tourist into a giant with 30 grieving dwarfs.
You're a compulsive liar.
You lie the truth!
I heard you say so!
I diagnose an enlarged liver due to mild alcoholism and you're in shock.
Otherwise you're as healthy as a horse!
No!
She fucks you and finishes you off!
"Okay, I'll go along with you."
"He slept with her, you slept with her."
He is dead.
Why are you still alive?
- Because Mary helped me.
I'm sorry.
I have a call outside for Mr. Mason.
Thank you.
- Gentlemen.
- Anytime.
No offense.
All part of the game.
Hello?
"Yes, Paul?"
Who?
Is there an Enos Watterton working for the company?
He phoned to say he had a headache this morning.
"He's probably at home, Paul."
Why?
That necktie that Lita Krail was holding in her hand belongs to Enos Watterton.
I don't know how she got my necktie.
"Look, can't you understand?"
When a guy drinks a little--
But you admit she was over here last night and you took her home a little before 11:00?
I didn't even get into her house.
- She-- she had something else to do.
- Like what?
I don't know.
"A couple of hours earlier, she asked me to call Sandy Sandover's wife just to make sure that Sandy had left for Phoenix."
Then later she got a call from Mr. Sellers about something.
Why did she want to know that Sandover had left town?
Search me.
Although she did say she thought it was about time she fixed Sandy's wagon.
"All right, Paul, you'd better take Mr. Watterton down to headquarters."
They'll want him as a material witness.
How can I explain it?
"Look, fellas, you gotta believe me."
You gotta leave quick!
Where to?
This is my home!
"No, it is dangerous!"
You have to leave!
Jimmy!
"Come, come!"
"DO you hear me, Colonel?"
I want all men of the 5th... shaved and in full uniform helping the civilians.
"Avoiding panic, putting out fires..."
"I want them to swallow lava, if need be."
And I want it all documented!
Did you hear me?
"Films, photos, radio, the whole operation!"
You may leave!
They're everywhere in Naples.
Impossible not to find.
They said that the Vesuvius hadn't had an eruption in 50 years.
This is historic!
"Right, Bob..."
"Right, boys."
"Here, in San Sebastiano... at the basis of the volcano."
All vehicles on duty now!
What are the orders?
"All land and air crews at work... in civilian rescue, madam!"
Aren't you afraid?
Fear... the only thing I'm afraid of is human stupidity.
"Because, unlike everything in the world, it knows no bounds."
How men can be idiots.
Is this the end of the world?
What is this?
"Don't be afraid, it's nothing."
I will destroy the jedi.
I'll show you.
You have failed me for the last time.
You are no longer my apprentice.
And now you shall die.
"Thank you, Artoo."
That's quite enough.
"Ventress, you're not looking well."
She never does.
"You have failed, Ventress, surrender."
Never.
"Yes, my lord."
Ventress is battling the jedi on board the command ship.
Turn your guns on our command ship and open fire.
"But, my lord,"
"I calculate that will destroy, Ventress, the jedi, and all our forces."
Precisely.
- We're in position.
- Open fire.
That is correct.
Calculate your flight path to terminate in the main hangar.
It's over.
"Anakin, look out!"
We have to get out of here.
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!
The command ship has been destroyed.
Our scanning indicates there are no survivors.
Your work there is finished.
Recall the fleet.
"Sweet Desdemona, O sweet mistress, speak!"
"- O, who hath done this deed?"
- Nobody.
I myself.
Commend me to my lord.
Why... how should she be murdered?
"Alas, who knows?"
You heard her say herself it was not I.
She said so:
I must needs report the truth.
She's a liar gone to burning hell:
T'was I that killed her.
"O, the more angel she, and you the blacker devil!"
She turned to folly;
and she was a whore.
"Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil."
- She was false as water.
- Thou art rash as fire to say... that she was false.
"O, she was heavenly true!"
Cassio did top her:
ask thy husband else.
"O, I were damned beneath all depth in hell but that I... did proceed upon just grounds to this extremity."
- Thy husband knew it all.
- My husband!
- Thy husband.
- That she was false to wedlock?
"Ay, with Cassio."
"Nay, had she been true..."
If heaven would make me... such another world of one entire and perfect chrysolite...
I'd not have sold her for it.
My husband!
"Ay, 'twas he that told me on her first."
"Uh, I'm a lawyer following up on a un-cashed check from FE Construction."
"Unfortunately, we'll need you to reissue the check."
Who is this?
Um... is this FE Construction?
Yes.
I don't recognize your voice.
"I'm a lawyer representing... someone... uh, who has an un-cashed check from FE Construction, and she can't access her funds, uh, unless you reissue, so..."
Who's the check made out to?
Cash.
"Where are you calling from, lady?"
"Can you just reissue the check, sir?"
Sure.
Give me a check number.
"You know what, um, I'll call you back with that information."
Thank you.
Wow.
"Oh, hey, Cary."
- How are you doing?
- Good.
"You seem to be, too."
"Oh, it's just from being liaison to Eli Gold."
"As soon as he's back on the campaign trail,"
I'll be out there with everyone else.
Where are you?
I'm out there with everyone else.
"Well, then you'll have company."
Canning.
"Oh, Cary."
- Good to have you back.
- Thank you.
The Veriscene case-- we're in the middle of negotiations.
"Yeah, go for it."
We?
"Okay, who's been on the phone?"
Hi.
What happened?
Did you guys have a fight?
Ever hear of the earthquake of '71?
Who's been on the phone?
You're supposed to be reachable by phone.
- Nobody.
- You're supposed to be on court call.
"We're here all the time, sarge."
"Yeah, well, then why has the phone been busy?"
Move your feet.
No wonder nobody's called me all week.
"You know, Poncherello?"
I could put another Form 2 in your jacket.
"Hey, sarge."
What brings you out here?
Baby food.
Not here.
Did you guys cite a baby food truck?
"- Yeah, we did."
"- Yeah, loose load."
We almost got killed.
"Well, that loose load contained contaminated baby food, botulism."
There are two boxes missing.
Either they're out on the road or someone picked it up.
Do you remember anybody or anything?
I was seeing double from my steeplechase ride.
"Look, guys, think."
It's important.
That stuff's poison.
Walls.
"Yes, furniture, walls, curtains, candles"
What else?
Darkness.
Precisely.
I dreamed of creating a hallway ten times the size of this room.
A room without darkness.
"On one side, windows looking out to the gardens, on the other, mirrors."
A hall of blinding light that would make the Palace famous throughout the world and for time eternal!
Let us now turn this dream into reality!
"It is Her Highness, Sire."
She is taken ill.
"Talk to me, doctor."
"I beg your patience, Sire."
"It would rather scrub your plans, wouldn't it, if she died?"
She will not die.
"Suppose, having the death of both my wives on your conscience?"
Henriette's death had nothing to do with me.
I beg to differ.
There is a certain test I wish to perform.
Here.
What is this for?
"Urine, Your Highness."
Of course.
Your staring at me is not making this any easier.
Thank you.
Wine.
Well?
Yer Highness is pregnant!
Congratulations!
My heartfelt congratulations to you both.
We did it!
"But it seems like that arm have not recovered fully, right."
What about his arm?
Heard he's got an injury in his left arm.
"Don't talk about strange things, Atobe."
Just play with me seriously.
The four of us will practice with you.
That's called the Rondo to Destruction.
Remember it well.
That's high!
"Oi, why didn't he smash the last ball?"
It won't matter much just to win.
"Let him play with that arm, that's slowly breaking down."
"If you go on playing the way you do, your arm will be shattered."
"No matter what, I want the team members to go to the Nationals together."
- Hah!
- Game to Seigaku.
One game to love.
"Tezuka, you're really..."
What a fearless guy.
30
- All
It's already been an hour into the match.
"Tezuka, your arm would have already exceeded its limit."
Do you want to destroy your arm just to win this match?
Here comes the Rondo to Destruction.
Take this!
Again.
40 - 30
Yes!
Hyotei will lose?
Hyotei gonna lose?
Hyotei will lose?
Let me tell you what's wrong with this TV.
"Them kids been here, that's what's wrong with this TV."
"No, Larry, the kids have not been in here."
"No, them kids been in here."
"Trust, OK?"
"They been in here playing that hindindu, OK?"
And I told them don't be playing the hindindu with my TV.
That's why I got a four-bedroom house for everybody.
Everybody have a room.
"In other words, you can't fix it."
I can fix this.
That ain't no problem.
I fix things for a living.
That's my job... to fix things.
"- What's up, Mr. Reed?"
"- Hey, Mr. Reed, how you doing?"
"From goons to mafia, from hooligans to terrorists,"
I gave every one bad dreams.
But one thief disturbed me very much.
"Not one or two, he committed 14 thefts."
He decamped with Rs.150 crores.
Government handed his case to me.
"Don't know why he's doing it, don't know where is he,"
"how is he, nobody knows it."
I stood for him...
I called him to take me...
I changed my face...
Cheated everyone...
I appeared strange...
I raced up the heart's pulse...
Teased mischievously...
Stole sleep from the eyes...
"Dunkirk, evacuation of troops, trapped by the German advance."
700 fishing boats and the world maybe on a mission to bring our boys home.
"Twin sisters, took their father's cockaboat, and, joined the rescue and came back with a deck of soldiers."
It's everything the Ministry are after.
Authenticity and optimism.
"Contradiction in terms if you ask me, but, this could be a bloody good story."
"Before they will give it a go ahead, they want someone to go down there and talk to the girls."
Me?
Unless your artist object.
"So, how did you meet?"
Came in to avail steelworks.
Ah!
He's one of those artists.
Older than you?
Yes.
Fifty?
No!
Sixty!
?
Oh!
That is tough.
You can't afford to be an artist.
Actually his family dis-inherited him.
Because of you?
Because of his politics.
So what do you think?
They there at the sea-side.
"And you never know, if there's a film at the end of it, it might be a better job in it for you."
I need somebody to run the slob.
Slob?
Girl talk.
Woman's dialog.
Of course he does.
But what happens when your father starts poking his nose into this Malcolm fellow?
Hmm?
"I mean, the guy is former Special Forces."
God only knows what he's doing for a living right now.
Isn't is safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened?
You should delete this.
You okay?
Yeah.
"Yeah, I'm fine."
Why don't you head back to the spa?
Don't have to tell me twice.
[Sighs]
"[Door opens, closes]"
Check this out.
"I compared the drive-on list from the studio to people connected to the fourth New York victim, Pat Crews."
- Any matches?
- Yeah.
Crews was a writing teacher at The New School.
"One of his early students is a successful screenwriter named Jordan Keegan, who now lives in New York but happened to be on the studio lot in L.A."
when the murder weapons went missing.
Let's pick his ass up.
"So, you're doing a news story on my nephew Malcolm, huh?"
Mm-hmm.
It's about war heroes.
Oh.
Look.
Isn't he handsome?
"Oh, yeah."
"But like I said, he's out of the country."
His job keeps him really busy.
"Let me get you his number, okay?"
"- you, like Alex, would fall in love with me."
- Rose...
Rose... no...
"I know, I know, I know, I was wrong, it was unfair of me to think you'd change."
- Rose...
Rose... but I think...
"- I know what you think, Greg, and just let me finish"
- what I was going...
"- Rose, Rose, I feel..."
"You feel very strongly about your beliefs, I appreciate that, but..."
"I'm sorry that I broke our agreement, it was just that I fell in love with you... stupid, right?"
Rose...
Rose...
I feel... that...
I don't want you to feel bad.
Because I'm not in love with you anymore.
What?
"Which ironically makes me perfect for this marriage, except now I don't want it."
"Suddenly... dinner doesn't seem like such a good idea, does it?"
I should...
I should go.
- Whe... whe... where are you going?
Your mother's?
- Just until I find my own place.
I...
"I hope at some point we can pick up where we left off, as friends."
Friends?
"I really do thank you, Greg, you're the first man who wanted to marry me... for any reason."
Can I call you tomorrow?
What for?
"You all have copies of the syllabus, right?"
Yes
I'm not sure who I should be asking for.
"Dr Penzler, just make the call."
"All right, all right."
"FBI, please."
What are you gonna do once you get to somebody in charge?
I'm gonna make my demands.
"You're gonna call the federal government and say,"
"""Let me speak to the man in charge of your super-secret operation because, if I don't, I'll shoot a few people"
That's pathetic is what that is.
"Well, no one ever said that Ray wasn't pathetic."
CYNTHIA:
I knew I never should've joined this damn group.
This is like White people land.
Do you know how many Asian people have been abducted since 1947 ?
Will you please shut up?
"Maybe seven, and you're looking at one of them."
"So I decide to be open and honest about it, and this is what I get--"
I'm abducted by Homer Simpson.
White people land.
Hello.
Hello.
Is this the--the FBI?
- You got 'em on the phone?
"- Um, yes."
Uh-huh.
See?
"This is, um, Dr Harriet Penzler."
I'm hoping you can help me.
I have a bit of a problem here.
DR PENZLER:
Yes.
"Um, I have a group of people here, and one of them's been shot."
Yes.
He hung up.
"Apart from Sonia Danidoff, do you remember any other names in the list?"
"Yes, maybe Tom... something."
"Or ""Thomas""."
This tells you something?
"Without the name, it will not."
There were also initials.
Unfinished words.
I think this list is the calendar for Fantomas futur attacks.
"I'm afraid, Fandor."
These phone calls.
Someone wants to kill me.
We will survive.
I promise you.
"Hello, Elizabeth."
"The convocation is at 4 pm, isn't it?"
"Yes, yes."
"Thank you for your call, last night."
It touched me.
I have not called.
"I beg you, Fandor."
Don't kid me.
"Despite the buzz, I recognized your voice."
What am I supposed to have said to you?
"Very nice things, very delicate."
And you asked me questions about the list again.
Someone imitated my voice.
Someone wanted to know what you exactly saw on that list.
You will not return to the hotel.
It's too dangerous.
But what am I going to do?
"Okay, Sara may still be in that tunnel."
"McNamara, let's get blueprints."
"Mei, Tac Team on standby."
Let's go.
Five Lincoln want a team leader.
The tunnel is secured.
This is team leader.
Good to go.
Valera stopped somewhere in here in the northbound bore.
"North and south tunnels are linked by three cross passages-- here, here, and here."
They're used for ventilation and maintenance.
Access shafts run off each cross passage.
So what about these?
Relief ducts.
They leed right into the drainage system
It's like a maze.
Perfect place to hide a body.
Live or otherwise.
"Okay, listen up!"
Sara Collins may still be alive in this tunnel structure.
Weapons down.
Eyes up.
Let's move.
You gonna be able to pick anything up through these walls?
It's a crap shoot.
"Kelton, we've got something."
It's definitely blood-- fresh.
that's a fingerprint.
Nice and clean.
Almost like someone made it on purpose.
Run it!
Plenty of room for Valera to pull over.
I'm worried.
You're never there when I send someone.
I don't know what to do.
You could phone.
That would make things easier.
True.
I hadn't thought of that.
Did you get my check?
Yes.
It was for my cotton business.
I'm worried about that too.
Coming.
Balla has been on the job for three months... and he's been well received by the workers.
His salary has risen and his work rate has improved.
"Therefore, management has decided... to take special measures, though not for the first time."
The police have opened an investigation.
Nothing new!
We've heard this story before... with all its mysteries.
The crowd you see over there is here because of your brother.
All will be known today.
How many times have we taken the blow?
Enough!
"Balla, you'll see us do it."
- Hello!
"- Hello, Touré!"
"The house is quiet, where are the servants?"
Madame has...
Sent them all away?
After I left?
"Naré, what an embarrassment!"
Sissoko is at the door.
How will I explain?
You're welcome.
You don't know how I've been waiting for this.
"Listen, you see Robin before I do, tell her I really appreciate it."
"- Are you listening to me, Stan?"
- Yeah.
Because you need to be very clear about something.
Go ahead.
This is not the beginning of anything.
This is the end.
Got no argument here.
"Look, I don't know what Robin told you about this but I made a couple mistakes, reference to some gambling."
"Believe me, I learned my lesson."
"I swear, Stan Heywood gambles no more."
"I swear to you, I really appreciate Robin helping me out like this."
You finished?
- Yeah.
"- I'm a cop, Stan."
"- Oh, God."
- The only reason I don't bust you--
- I made a couple mistakes--
- I understand.
Things happen.
"I won't pop you, because I haven't looked inside that envelope."
"If I were to find money in there, I'd pop you."
So forget whatever you're thinking.
You've committed a crime.
"If you ever approach Robin again, I will put you in jail."
You understand me?
Straight to Rikers.
Yeah.
Get out of here.
MARTINEZ:
- I expect Malaparte knows for sure...
Thank you.
- How much is it?
- Ten liras.
Thank you.
"Yes, understood."
Alright.
Thank you.
"Wow, a Renaissance banquet... in the middle of the Second World War."
"Thanks to my modest contribution, we should be able to avoid... those terrible meat rations and canned pineapple."
ldiot!
"What are you doing, Sergeant?"
"Excuse me Captain, but Private Prewitt... had a regrettable case of Mussolini's revenge."
And it was sudden!
"Right, continue, Sergeant."
But get out of there!
Damn it!
"Stop, there are landmines!"
They'll be killed!
"My god, Prewitt!"
Let me see.
- Are you a medic?
"- No, but I know what to do."
Then get your hands off him!
Give me something to cover him with.
"Why waste time on that, Captain?"
- We have to get him to the hospital!
- There have been many cases like this.
"If we move him, he'll have a cruel death before we get him to the hospital."
"If we make him comfortable, the pain will pass."
- He'll die in his sleep.
- Like a dog!
"Oh, you Jews are so Old Testament."
I did my job.
How are things?
"Barney and I are still under the same roof, if that's what you mean."
"He does the dishes, I sort the socks and ironing, we don't talk."
So all back to normal.
"As in, you mean, are you off the hook?"
"No, I didn't mean that."
(Quiet knock on door)
Just a sec.
Wendy rang.
"Something about a meeting with John Bartrop, which typically you didn't share with me."
I don't know any John Bartrop.
Who is John Bartrop?
You were apparently due at Fuzz's school an hour ago.
"Oh, shit."
That John Bartrop.
Sorry.
"Um, Red, can we talk later?"
Why?
"He is a beautiful student, an absolute pleasure to teach."
"You don't have to sugar coat this for me, you know."
I mean every word of it.
"The other teachers' comments have ranged from,"
'Is everything alright at home' to 'Have doctors mentioned medication?
'
"(Laughs) Well, Finnegan has issues."
His attention span isn't enormous but he's so engaging and clever.
Wow.
"Well, he does like your classes."
English is the only subject he seems to study.
He expresses himself beautifully.
"Okay, I am, kinda, but that doesn't change anything."
I still plan on doing the best job I can do while I'm here.
How lucky for us.
I would never have taken this job if I didn't respect what I.A. does.
We investigate our own.
When they've done something wrong.
But I.A. also defends and clears the innocent when wrongly accused.
Nice.
You been practicing that?
- How'd it sound?
- Good.
But I'm not the one you need to convince.
Joe Penn was a whiner.
Wanted morphine for four stitches.
I handed him off to an intern.
What about Valerie McDougal?
Valerie was brought in about 1:00 a.m.
She was involved in the same bar fight as Joe Penn-- come on!
The bartender-- she was pretty messed up.
Two broken ribs and a busted lip.
"I wrapped the ribs, glued her lip, and gave her some pain meds and told her to take it easy."
Is Valerie still here?
No.
Her boyfriend came and picked her up around 3:00 a.m. boyfriend?
Yeah.
Some big ugly-looking cop.
- How'd you know he was a cop?
- Ha.
Flashed his badge.
How'd you know he was her boyfriend?
I saw 'em kissing.
- Anything else?
May I speak with you?
Something very terrible has happened.
- Oh!
- Ah!
Again.
- George seems more cheerful.
- Mm.
She has a crush on Chopin.
The Polish corpse?
- They couldn't be more different.
- Then they will definitely fall in love.
I suppose as friends we should help them along.
Absolutely not!
"Franz, you and I must put ourselves between them at every opportunity."
- Marie!
Your turn.
- Yes.
"He is so frail, darling."
You know George will finish him off.
- The countess made advances to you?
- She is my friend's mistress.
- She has borne his child.
- He wouldn't mind if she changed hands.
"Really, I don't understand the attitude of you people."
Are we at a livestock sale?
"She's a woman, not a goat."
- Are you in love with her yourself?
- Of course not.
"""I'm not full of virtues and noble qualities."""
"""I love, that is all."""
"""But I love strongly, exclusively, steadfastly."""
"No, it's like something out of a novel..."
That's why it's not magnetic.
I've never seen markings like this before.
It can mean only one thing.
"It must be a page from the Book of Atlantis, hidden there by Solon himself."
"Kelly, can you take us into the crater?"
Yes.
"If we leave now, we can make it before sunset."
Come on.
"Well, it looks like it was a temple."
Strange place for one.
Great place to hide a treasure though.
"Well, if there was an entrance, it's long since been destroyed."
Here.
Let's clear it.
"In ya go, MacGyver."
MacGyver.
Did you find anything?
"Oh, yeah."
Bigtime.
Incredible.
Look familiar?
A Copernican model of the solar system.
Built thousands of years before Copernicus was born.
The planets must be orbiting closer to the alignment.
The gravitational shift of the alignment's making the volcano unstable.
I hate when that happens.
"Solon said, ""Enter the Gates of Hades."""
"Well, what are we waiting for?"
Ah!
Poor devil.
What triggered it?
Do you think it's Cleeve?
- Get out.
- Okay.
- So many questions.
It was never boring working with you people.
Hmm.
Back and forth.
Back and forth.
"One day your government wants me,"
The next I'm a crackpot.
"Your own partner said to me, ""never again."""
Even then I knew
One day one of you would be back
To place an order.
Huh?
"Oh, it better be cash."
American credit ain't what it used to be.
What's that?
Another gadget for me to tinker with?
Wait.
I did what you asked.
Lots of eyes to make the switch here.
I guess night's our only option.
White house won't be any easier.
I'd feel a lot more comfortable doing it
Before it gets anywhere near the president.
"It's ridiculous that we don't know what we're protecting him from, but..."
Typical Artie.
"I mean, I understand grabbing the artifact"
Before it causes trouble.
But he couldn't spare two seconds
To warn us about what we're walking into?
"Look, I'm sure if it were really dangerous,"
"And this, a photo he had on him."
It's from 1940.
1940.
Everything's leading us to the same year.
Alright.
"Have Amelia and her team visit him in the hospital, immediately."
"Time travel with a shrimp allergy, now that is risky."
I don't know what you're talking about.
About this.
"We're pressed for time, so you can confess everything now."
"Relax, Alonso."
Tell us how you arrived here from 1940.
"I'm sick, not crazy."
Time travel can't be done.
"Yes, yes it can."
"We do it, as a matter of fact."
So I'm sure that you aren't crazy.
"But if you don't work with us, we can lock you up in an asylum for life."
Are you sure this will work?
I've synchronized the frequency with my phone.
We'll hear everything that Himmler says from his room.
I don't hear anything.
They haven't gotten back from the bull fight.
Here they are.
(HIMMLER) (SPEAKING GERMAN)
What did he say?
"-""What a disgusting spectacle""."
"""Gallito is a fucking murderer""."
Whereas they have Auschwitz... now that's a show for the whole family.
Heil Hitler.
-Heil Hitler.
(SPEAKING GERMAN)
What was that for?
I bet that this would suck.
[Laughs]
"What a fucking, fucking, fucked up thing, man."
It was a fucked-up burn.
These guys are doing a high fall for us later.
It's the same shit every time.
Never hire Lloyd's friends.
Never.
INTERVIEWER:
What's your biggest fear of today?
Not getting the shots and not going on schedule
Are my biggest fear every day.
"We had a-- we had to have a Toxie stand in,"
Because our Toxie was late.
He's usually incredibly punctual.
He's been consistent every single day.
I think he's one of the first people on set almost every day.
"And yet today, he overslept."
Fucking dammit.
I said 6 o'clock.
It's three hours and they can't get the guy into costume.
INTERVIEWER:
That did not make Lloyd very happy.
"No, it didn't make anybody very happy."
[Inaudible] at the office.
Yeah.
"I can't hold their fucking hands, Lloyd."
You can kick them in the ass.
You can certainly ring their bloody necks.
"And you know, mules-- if you kick a mule hard enough,"
You get it to pull the plow.
"Oh, yeah."
"Oh, yeah."
Boys!
Are special in theyr own way!
Girls!
Are special like the birthday
And always we dancing and singing alone here he comes [sings] [sings] [sings]
Who the hell is that?

He's already seen HM3 over a hundred times.
Everyone is special in their own--
Special in their own way
"Let it out, party people"
Are we the only ones here who are completely confused?
Yeah.
"I guess, we better check that movie out."
[singing]
This-- is cool?
[singing]
This is cool?
"We are really getting old, you guys."
[singing]
It says that DVD sold more copies than any DVD ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and they did 80 millions in opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out guys."
"If this is much cool today, I'm done."
I no longer have any connections with this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes, I'm not doing this."
-And just hustling?
I said you're coming to mass You!
You're fucked in the head!
OK?
There!
Pierre!
"I wanted to find before you, but I have not arrived."
Sit.
"I can not, I parked illegally."
And my friends just go.
Come on!
I visited some Tellier.
"He wants 50,000 euros for an accident in the basement."
"Funny, it seems to think that I'll pay him."
This guy's a jerk.
I do not know what a lawyer.
What kind of accident?
UltimateFightChampionship.
Berserker fight in which all blows allowed.
"Not allowed, but the posjeæeno well the money is on the bet."
I know it is not good engage in illegal things.
"I'll stop, but I will not over become a provincial night clerk."
What exactly happened?
Stupid Tellier's cousin sent into combat.
In the second round broke his spine.
"Will no longer walk, but I do?"
He should not have come.
You know that you can be prosecuted because of the violence and causing disability?
"No worries, I have a very good attorney."
-Just so.
"I am a lawyer, I'm not to your debt."
Solve it.
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.
We're moving to a new home.
Why?
I see.
"Uh, how long has this been going on?"
Ever since we got back from vacation.
It was not a vacation.
It was an aliyah.
That's a pilgrimage to Israel.
Where did you visit when you were in Israel?
We shopped in Tel Aviv.
We swam in the dead sea.
It was wonderful.
They have spa treatments there.
- Then we went to the wailing wall...
- Oh!
- Where... this one went bananas.
"- I-I mean, I was brought to my knees."
- And I was moved to tears.
- He was on his knees.
"- B-being there, praying there..."
"- It was very scary, actually."
That is as close to heaven as I've ever felt.
It changed me forever.
Jerusalem syndrome?
"Mm, it's been around since ancient times."
"Apparently, people go to these holy sites, like the wailing wall, and they start relinquishing possessions,"
"- wearing togas, sermonizing."
"- Yeah, but it's..."
It's temporary.
And they usually recover in a couple of days.
"Yeah, but this has been going on for three weeks with this guy."
Tracy said it's getting worse every day.
He's such a show-off.
You're eating doughnuts for lunch?
Seyed!
Seyed my cart is stolen my cart
"- Hey girl, have you seen a cart?"
- What?
- Cart have you seen my cart?
- No.
These ooward people put my father in trouble and now they are doing same to me.
"My father left Tangak because of me, because of Hanieh and my mom."
But at this time I came to Tangak by myself and I won't be stopped at all.
I will stand for it until the end.
How dare they underestimate me?
Are they Kufa's people?
"If my father can't play kettledrum till dawn, I will do it."
I promised to play kettledrum for Hanieh's leg to be cured.
"I stand for it, until the end."
What are they thinking?
"Seyed Abdullhossein, You make them understand!"
I am Bashirou!
Bashirou!
ZaerAli's son!
Tangaki Captain ZaerAli's son!
I confront them until the end!
Unljl last moment!
Can you hear me?
Did you hear or not?
"If you are real men, show up then I'll show them!"
I do something to you that nobody has done it before.
Their neck twisted.
"Do whatever you want with me, I am so tough skinned."
I am still in Tangak_
Do whatever you want with me.
I am still in Tangak_
"I was, uh, behind enemy lines in France."
"First, it doesn't feel like anything."
Adrenaline's good that way.
"Then, it was burning."
White hot.
I was trying to help a family of Jews.
Police didn't like that.
You know about the Jews?
About the Nazi Master Plan?
All those trains taking them East every day.
"They're not being ""resettled."""
They're being exterminated.
Five thousand Jews per train.
Ten trains per day.
You do the math.
"Your father, he's in charge of running the train schedules for the German Transport Ministry, right?"
He's very good at his job.
Very efficient.
How'd you get captured?
My plane was shot down.
You survived.
What about your crew?
I always wanted to learn how to fly.
Must be something up there.
"Everything looking so small, like tiny little pieces on a board game."
It's not a game.
"Real men, dying every day."
"And I'm being moved from camp to camp, for what?"
- It doesn't make sense anymore.
- You won't eat.
- Why are you still fighting?
- I fight for my country.

Very well.
Detach the subject.
"Good work, everyone."
We'll resume tomorrow.
(DOOR OPENS)
"You were never planning on going back to Abnegation, were you?"
I had to do what I felt was right.
Our parents would be ashamed of you.
"Well, maybe not."
"I mean, I am willing to sacrifice you, the only family I have left, the only person I love, in order to preserve what's best for everyone else."
What's more selfless than that?
"What does Jeanine think is in that box, Caleb?"
It's a message from The Founders.
All happiness belongs to her.
Don't speak anymore with Judith!
Watch out David!
"Dr. Martel, do you hear me?"
- His name is...
- David.
David?
"If you can hear me, blink your eyes."
Get it out!
- Intracranial nerves?
- There's no broken hematoma.
Scanning?
I want it in my office.
No sweat.
No tears.
"They still need eye drops, or they'll end like him."
What are they doing?
The guilty deserve punishment!
They are OK.
What do you mean?
They are the ones who did it?
Let me show you something.
Are you crazy?
These children don't know pain.
"That's why they're very dangerous to other children, but mainly to their own selves."
Can we cure it?
I'd never seen anything like this.
They suffer from an unknown illness.
"Citizens, I have to tell you that..."
"These children, they suffer from an unknown illness."
Tragic events and strange facts happen for months and kill innocent people.
This tragedy... shows ... the threat posed by crime.
"I know I'm new here, but aren't dinosaurs extincted?"
- This one's about to be.
"- Heatwave, wait!"
"Look, if anyone sees you taking down that dino on your own, there goes your cover and your mission."
It's attracted to the light!
"Chase, take your lights!"
That got us attention.
Now what?
We need to lure him somewhere with no people around.
"Rescue Bots, roll to the rescue!"
He's following but we still gonna need an assist.
I'm comm-link to Chief in.
Rescue headquarters.
Go ahead.
"Dad, OK, first, don't worry I'm with the Rescue Bots!"
What?
Who gave you permission to...
They did it.
I mean...
"Dad, I don't know how to tell you this but the Rescue Bots aren't robots, they're from another planet, they're aliens!"
How long have you known?
"Wait, you know?"
"Cody, where are you?"
"Chief Burns, if I may, we're headed westbound to Lake Street with the dinosaur in pursuit."
"A dinosaur, again?"
"Cody, you're driving, are you?"
No!
Why did we take the old squad car?
That's why.
I'll explain later.
"Cody, you jacked my ride?"
"Listen, the T-rex likes lights."
- The warrant!
"Sir, where is the Honorable?"
Have him come right away!
Calm down.
- You hear him?
A warrant?
- You'll see.
But I was acquitted.
- The arrest warrant.
- What warrant!
Sir!
If I get my hands on you!
You dirty bastard!
"Sooner or later, I'll get out!"
And I'll kill you and that other geezer!
"Criminals, crooks!"
"Let go of me, let go of me!"
They get in their messes and expect us to work miracles!
PRISON
I gladly accepted the request to help you because the case interests me in a very particular way.
"I've studied it deeply, I think it's a case of mythomania complicated by a form of amnesia with a hysterical character."
I had a similar case in..
'23.
- In '23.
There had recently happened a.. a..
The March on Rome.
"- Eh, good times!"
"- Yes, good times."
- Honorable!
The march on Rome?
- Good times because we were younger then.
And this little one here was in junior high!
"""Come to the plaza for some"" -- hold on--"
"""zoom, zoom, zoom, and a boom, boom."""

"- I don't know what that is, so I brought some sweats and an apple, just in case."
"Okay, I talked to Travis, and I tried to take off my mom goggles."
"Business whiz, or mega nerd?"
It took  everything I could do not to give him a super wedgie.
"Laurie, I'm so sorry"
I encouraged this terrible idea.
"It's okay, honey."
"It just shows how much you care, you know?"
And I get it now.
"Just this morning, I was changing Baby Bobby, and he caught me with a laser of pee right between the eyes, and all I could think was,"
"""That's amazing aim, little guy."""
[ Gasps ] He's so talented!
"Oh, wait."
Do I have grandma goggles?
"You have lots of different goggles, Jules."
But I love you for 'em.
"Kids, you're gonna hit the last note of ""Twinkle, Twinkle,"""
"and then-- kapow-- right into ""Buns."""
Hot-cross your own buns.
My class has a jam to pump.
- You guys with me?
!
All:
- Yeah!
- That guy is wack.
- [ Laughs ]
All:
Tiny Eyes!
Tiny Eyes!
In other words...
Noah controls the atmosphere of the Earth.
What are you going to do with Noah?
What?
Why did you do that?
!
That data belonged to our nation!
You two will go into Noah with me.
can you?
Not if you care about the lives of the people here.
Wait!
Your behavior goes against the will of the army's!
Go away.
doctor.
so you're Macdougal.
they put a magnetic field brain amplifer in your head.
Surely they realized such a device could kill you without warning.
isn't it?
Dr. Mayzel.
That's why the Pentagon tried so desperately to obtain you.
They justify every crime in the name of patriotism.
until they created you.
That is why you are also a creature with the ugly ego of that nation.
That's old-fashioned sentimentalism.
I was not only chosen by my nation but by God.
What did you say?
Spriggan!
Where did that brat go?
!
Shoot him!
Shoot him to death!
That's far enough!
Give my regards to Sion and Noa.
You...
Who would want to tell the princess anything about you?
You little... son of a...
Let me go!
Look at that!
Protect His Excellency!
"Let His Excellency, Field Marshal Klom withdraw!"
They're a bunch of damned fools!
"You are, too."
You Roland folk are all idiots.
Truly foolish and good for nothing.
"I can't stand it, so I'll bail you out."
"Hey, you sons of bitches!"
Save those Roland fools!
Prepare to fire large-scale magic!
"If we fire that in a situation like this, we'll hit our own people."
He should absorb the magic.
That can buy us some time!
Fall back!
Damn it...
Captain Milk!
Luke made you a delicious cake!
"Please come out, Captain Milk!"
Ryner Lute departed from his inn this morning and hasn't been seen since.
After Captain Milk visited him.
That directive...
Maybe I was wrong to have shown it to him.
I know that you're hiding.
How about showing yourself?
"So, what business might you have with me?"
Milk Callaud is in our custody.
People have always had the potential to change in horrible ways.
Who in particular are you thinking of?
You or me?
"Mariá, everything might be over as early as tomorrow, but I think it's been worth it."
- There's Smithy with two others!
"- Emiliano, Smithy's coming with two others."
"- Yes, that's Smithy."
- Are you sure?
- Who are they?
- We couldn't have found anyone better.
- Is Carrasco here?
- I'm glad you're back.
"- Yes, he's here and waiting for you."
- We were in the same cell.
I'm Hidalgo.
"Hello, Smithy."
Is it really you or is it your ghost?
Of course it's me.
You know good old Smithy's body.
Ghosts can disguise themselves.
You scared us.
"This time I nearly died, but at a certain point I said to myself,"
"""You're going to make it, because you want to be embraced by Mariá again. """
"If you should ever leave your Leopard, a scrawny European is waiting for you."
"With you, I'd end up as a tea-drinking landlady."
- So you've cheated death once more.
- As always.
This is Hidalgo.
He used to fight in the north.
That's Joaquín.
He wants to go and see his family.
He's leaving today.
"He had a passion, a transmitted lustfulness,... a feeling which I had never experienced before."
-Are you still there?
-Yes.
-Are you alone?
"-Yes, but only momentarily."
Who is he?
Your boyfriend?
Your husband?
"-A peasant, but he's not here now."
-It's better that way.
Let's take advantage of that.
Touch yourself and imagine it to be my hand that fondles your sexy bits.
He was stronger than me and emerged spontaneously to satisfy... the unknown and the unseen.
I don't know.
"Are you doing it, Rosella?"
-Yes.
-Bravo.
"You are getting your caresses from me, you know."
-What are you touching?
-My breasts within my blouse.
-On top of my bra.
-Bring them out.
Moisten your fingertips with saliva... and wet your nipples.
Do you like it?
It is my hand that plays with you.
"-Tell me, if you like it."
"-Yes, I like it."
"Very good, continue and pretend that it is my hand, that fondles you."
Bloody hell!
"Rosella, my love, let me feel how wet you are between your legs."
"Feel it, my love."
My fingers just slipped into your panties.
Marybeth?
Two-bars has been here all morning.
He went over the place from top to bottom.
You got to do something about Eddie's pension.
They're going to reduce it.
What about the Police Memorial Award?
The precinct says it goes to the next of kin.
"Well, this piece of brass isn't here to give me any award."
"$40,000 in cash was found in Detective Santos' strongbox here at his summer cottage in Ulster County."
Emergency Service Unit workers...
Frank?
"Yeah, I'm up at the cabin."
They found the money.
Good work.
I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County  but would like to stress that these are implications only.
Can you believe this shit?
We never set foot in that dump after Eddie's father died.
- It's full of hornets' nests.
"- Yeah, busy hornets."
"Never in our life did we see $4,000 cash much less 40."
There's only 2 people know that's not Eddie's money.
You and me.
Who is this?
Vinnie Zapatti.
I can get you out of this.
"I can get you the pension, the medals."
You want them?
"Sure, sure, I want them."
Good.
"Damn it, I can't stand him."
I can't believe this is happening.
Richard... used to work for me years ago.
"And that's Priscilla, my best ex-wife."
They recently moved back to New York.
This is not gonna work.
Let's get out of here.
Why was she your best wife?
Everything with her was as intimate as kissing.
I never really got over her... the most orgasmic woman I've ever been with.
Who was the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with?
You could use my first name.
But I hope I'm not the most orgasmic woman you've ever been with.
I'm not that easy.
"- Hello, Priscilla."
"- Hello, George."
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- I don't.
"I look like shit, but thank you."
- How do I look?
"- Depraved, but well-fed."
"Jonathan, this is Richard and Priscilla Antrem."
Richard is the new editor of Women's Wear Daily.
"George, you know I'm editing GQ."
Don't be petty.
- I'm sorry.
I get the two confused.
- Of course you do.
You ought to try doing The Times crossword puzzle.
It's supposed to be good for senile dementia.
"Richard, George, please."
"Well, it's very nice to meet the both of you."
Did a cop tell you that?
We need to get to the guy first.
He's in a hotel on rue Marcadet.
The Étoile d'Agadir.
You don't answer questions any more?
"Fuck, Gilou, I'm fighting for you!"
You want to end up in jail?
Let's go.
"Arnaud, are you aware that as an intern, you are allowed to follow a police investigation in the field?"
"Yes, I know."
"Our relationship being what it is, I suggest you take this opportunity."
"Thank you, but I'd rather stay here."
And I have seen enough of you.
You are starting tomorrow.
They are informed of your arrival.
"- Is everything all right, Marianne?"
"- It's nothing, Your Honour."
It's just the shelf collapsing.
"Wait, let me take care of it."
My husband has a safe in a bank on the Champs-Elysées...
"Average height, short dark hair."
Stocky.
This is a peaceful hotel.
I don't want any trouble.
"Please, answer."
"OK, your colleagues came yesterday."
Yesterday?
- Yes.
They took the man you're looking for.
What was his name?
He called himself Mr Bo.
Thank you.
Come in.
"Hey, Stephen."
- How are you?
- Good.
I just wanted to say I had a really great time with you the other night...
- on our date.
"- Me, too."
"Hey, did you get the flowers I sent?"
You sent.
Of course.
Thank you so much.
I love them.
"Um, then why are they in the trash?"
Can I be totally honest with you?
Molly put them in there.
She's a little bitter.
"Listen, I know it was just one date, and I don't want you to attach too much meaning to the flowers."
"Apparently, that's not a problem."
"Anyway, I was just wondering if, hopefully, there might be another opportunity to...."
"Well, someone is popular today."
Check it out.
These flowers kick those flowers' ass.
You want to know who they're from?
- Yeah.
- No.
"""Congratulations, you've been named ""to Manhattan Monthly's 'Ten Most Eligible' list, a who's who of the city's most datable professionals."""
I'm so excited for you.
She doesn't seem that bitter.
They are going to interview you and everything.
"Oh, you're gonna have your pick of any man in Manhattan."
"You know, I'm just... think I'm gonna..."
Okay.
It's an act of love.
It's the divine mystery itself.
"You must think I'm inexperienced, but I assure you,"
I was baptised in the brothels of Paris when I first arrived.
"But, um..."
"I'm so ill, and I have been for such a long time, and my body is such a great disappointment to me that I've already said goodbye to it."
I'm not really in it any more.
I'm just happier floating about in music.
"And if I should come back inside this miserable collection of bones, then I am afraid that it would probably collapse altogether."
Forgive me.
- I am ashamed.
"- No, no."
Forgive me.
"I'm a fraud, you know."
Divine mystery!
I've never experienced that with anyone.
I've always had disastrous relationships.
- I've never managed to stay in love.
- Why?
I don't know.
I want too much.
I think.
Except when I hear you play.
And when I'm around you.
Look...
I simply want to be with you.
The rest doesn't matter.
Really.
Do you think we could just...
be together?
Like this?
Yes.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
Yeah.
Hi.
Hi.
"Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
So everyone's just gonna watch us?
Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"Come on, man."
How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"No, those are actually always there... something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
NineNine!
"Chills, you guys."
"Literally, chills."
"Hey there, Nikolaj."
It's your papa.
"If you're watching this, something bad has happened to me."
I think this is about it.
- She hit an artery!
"- Michelle, call medical!"
"No, she's bleeding too much."
We got to take her there now!
- Tell security!
- We need someone from medical.
- Interrogation room 819.
- Uncuff her.
Now!
So what did Sherry have to say?
That Alan had a heart attack.
And you believe her?
I'd be a fool to believe anything Sherry says to save herself.
But murder?
I can't imagine she'd do that.
"David, we can't allow ourselves to be caught off guard this time."
Now we have to assume the worst.
Then we'd also have to assume that Julia was somehow involved.
What?
"Whoa, whoa, listen."
"David, I'm sorry, but Julia's not the same kind of person that Sherry is."
"When we find out all the facts, we'll proceed from there."
I have to go over the morning brief with Jerry.
All right.
- Hello?
"- Julia, it's me."
Wayne?
"I just heard about Alan, and I... are you alone?"
The police are here.
I'm was just going to speak with one of the officers.
"All right, tell me what happened."
"Kids, your Uncle Marshall definitely doesn't want you to know this, but he also smoked off and on."
"It all started when he was 13, on a camping trip in Minnesota."
"Come on, Marshall, let's celebrate."
It's summer vacation.
"Okay, but just one."
This is my first and last cigarette ever.
"And that was the first of many, many ""last cigarettes ever."""
That's it.
"I am done, I am out."
Last...
Cigarette ev-arrh!
"So, by that point, I'd heard it all before."
Last cigarette ever.
What are you doing?
You haven't smoked in six months.
Is this about the McRib?
"It's gone, dude, let it go."
"I'm worried about work, okay?"
"They just hired a new head of the legal department, and he's going to be letting people go."
So that's why you're worried?
The new head of the legal department is Arthur Hobbes.
"As in ""Artillery Arthur""?"
As in your former boss?
Arthur Hobbes was the meanest boss
Marshall or anyone else had ever had.
"The last time Marshall worked for him, it ended like this."
I quit!
Yikes.
So does he hold it against you?
Worse.
"I'm sorry, who are you?"
"I'm, I'm Marshall Eriksen."
Who cares?
My Leno was great.
This is the guy that you hate.
So sad.
Wow this thing is everywhere.
"Hannah and Jesse, America's new sweethearts."
"Good night, everybody."
"Bye, bye."
Thanks for watching.
"Oh great I just took over ""most viewed"" from ""Kitty Kat Flushing a Toilet."""
Uh that just means that you're bigger than.
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
"""Meow, meow."" Flush."
[Whispers] You should be proud.
What was I thinking inviting Jesse back in the band?
I mean Hannah's irresistible.
There's no way that he could.
Go against her feminine charms.
I just want to go home put the wig on.
And smack that home wrecker in the face.
You know as much as I'd love to see how that works.
I think you're freaking out for no reason.
I mean you can still date Jesse as Miley just not in public.
Why does my life have to be so complicated?
Oh yeah.
Poor little most famous 17-year-old in the whole world.
Now will you just focus on the positives okay?
We're both going to college together we both have wonderful boyfriends.
-Except for you're more...
-No.
No cracks about Oliver until I find something.
Equally embarrassing about Jesse.
- (Foster) Good evening.
(Cissy) Hello.
(Poppy) Hello.
- What your name?
- Jock McGregor.
Jock McGregor.
Do come in.
"I'm Cissy Meldrum, this is my sister Poppy."
I-I won't shake hands.
A kid were sucking' a stick of toffee on the bus and it went all over the handrails.
"Ooh, aren't you strong?"
Your muscles are bursting out of that suit.
"It fits you very well, of course."
You develop muscles when you work for a living.
May I say what an honour it is to be invited to your beautiful home.
We think it's a bit old-fashioned but you can't shift Daddy.
We know that fine at the factory.
"I'm serving drinks, who wants stout and who wants raspberryade?"
"Nonsense, Ivy, I'll mix some cocktails."
"Now, who fancies a white lady?"
"It's going to be agony, George."
They could stop for hours.
How will we get rid of them?
Don't worry.
I've invited the bishop after dinner.
One look at his dog collar and they'll be off.
"Ah, hello, everybody."
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
"Oh, not at all, my lord."
"I was just saying what an honour it is, and a privilege,"
- to be invited to your beautiful home.
- Ah.
In Benigno's house?
Yes.
Why are you living there?
Benigno is dead.
"One day, you and I should talk."
"Yes, and it will be simpler than you think."
Nothing is simple.
I'm a ballet mistress and nothing is simple.
TALK TO HER
The stage is full of wooden chairs and tables.
"Two women come out, wearing slips."
"Their eyes are closed, like two sleepwalkers."
You're scared they'll bump into everything.
"But suddenly, a man appears, with such a sad face."
The saddest I've ever seen.
And he knocks all the chairs and tables out of their way.
You can't imagine how moving it was!
"There was a man sitting beside me, in his forties, good-looking."
"He cried several times, from emotion."
I can understand why.
It was so beautiful!
I have a surprise for you!
I got Pina Bausch's autograph for you.
I had to buy the photo.
It's in English.
"It means: ""I hope you overcome all your obstacles and start dancing."""
"- Look, she's got her period."
- It's early.
Good evening.
"Benigno, could you stay tonight?"
My sister can't stay with the kids and I've got no one else.
- Yep.
Here you go.
Thanks.
It's all old folks.
Not an asshole in sight.
Should we just go?
You know...
"Hey, does ""wheat"""
"sound anything like ""sourdough""?"
"You know, put a nickel in it, honey."
Assholes trump old people.
Good amendment.
It's a living document.
Mustard dip.
Ready?
The mustard dip... a simple yet effective small-time con.
- You know the secret to making toast?
"- Pick a mark with a calm,"
- easygoing temperament.
- You toast it!
"Next, casually spill a condiment of your choosing on your unsuspecting mark."
"Here, let me give you a hand."
"Now, in one simple, fluid motion, remove your mark's jacket."
This should be done without effort or aggression.
"Finally, extract the wallet just as your partner appears to seamlessly abscond with it."
Perfect in elegance and simplicity.
This man stole my wallet!
Well done.
Whoa.
"No, he did not."
Here...
It's here.
- How about her?
How about the new girl?
- No.
"I mean, I don't know her."
Shut up.
"Look, I want someone I know, someone who knows me, someone who we know each other, someone like, uh..."
Topanga!
"Topanga, my honey."
- May I call you honey?
- No.
"Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend."
"Believe me, I don't want this any more than you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together."
"Cory, my dear little butthead..."
May I call you butthead?
Sure.
- I can't walk through life with you.
- Is there someone else?
There's everybody else.
Why?
"We're already standing together, and we look great."
"Oh, come on."
Work with me here.
"Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love."
"Then, after a week, they hate each other."
"So for one great passionate week, we'd lose a friendship that could last a lifetime."
- I'm in if you are.
"- Cory, don't worry."
I'm sure there's someone out there for you.
Gimme a name!
"- For the record, I dumped her."
- That's how I saw it.
"Well, Dubin's out sick again."
"Come on, get out."
Quickly.
Be as quiet as possible.
What a surprise!
I studied in Fuente Nueva as well.
I wasn't there for long.
I studied for one semester and...
Padre Julio!
"Come on, señora, I think one of the men is dying."
Hurry up!
I was about to change the bandage when I noticed he was unconscious.
- Probably internal bleedings.
- Yes.
"- Padre Miguel, I want to tell you something."
- We must operate immediately.
Prepare everything.
"Nurse, I think there's enough plasma left."
"Yes, I'll go and get it, Padre."
Come on.
You ungodly lot!
How dare you threaten me with guns in the house of the Lord?
You're protecting rebels in the name of your Lord.
How many?
We're not protecting them.
They turned up out of the blue.
Some were injured.
What else could we do?
They carry guns like you.
You'd better be sensible.
"Being a priest, I'm sure you detest lies."
Where are the rebels' guards positioned?
You must promise not to kill them.
Very good.
"Well, normally I start with the cellar."
Why don't we go directly to the bedroom?
Did you forget?
I already confessed...
"- Right, we're even."
"- This way, please."
"- This is a marvellous home, Captain!"
- Thank you.
Did you buy it or have it built?
"I bought it, though I designed the landscape."
I congratulate you.
The lady's bath is ready.
Will she take it alone?
What did she say?
"Well, she wants to know if you're taking your bath alone."
But Maria sometimes simplifies things a bit too much.
Forgive her.
It must be difficult to handle so many baths for couples.
"No, thank you Maria."
I think I'll be able to maintain control... for at least the next five minutes.
"The lady will take a bath in five minutes, and by herself."
It's from Jean Louis.
- Urgent!
- Right.
"Don't tell me, it's an invitation to organize an orgy."
You're partially right.
What part?
"An orgy, organize or invited?"
The third part.
It's a party exclusively for me.
I know you understand me...
Keep talking.
Where did you go?
- Brown.
"- Yeah, how long?"
Two years.
Before you dropped out?
There you are.
They're looking for this.
Mainframe's connected to the computer.
So whatever's on this...
You said the codes were impossible to crack.
Unless you have the original cypher.
"But whatever they're looking for, it's on this, so can you?"
"Yeah, I'm on it, I'm on it."
Who's this?
"Oh, it's the Director of Clandestine Operations Overseas."
Somebody's boss's boss's boss.
Somebody high up in the company.
Director Atwater.
Director Collins.
Templeman.
Keep going.
"Yeah, these are people being groomed for top slots in the corporation."
"Go back, go back."
I know that man.
That's my fucking boss.
Fifteen dossiers.
Fifteen broadcasts.
There it is.
"If I wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop, these would be the 15 I'd start with."
"You kill these men today, you won't recognize the world when you wake up in the morning."
But they've already sent the broadcasts.
I know you got that movie deal.
I know you're starring in it.
Congratulations.
"I'm a nice guy, but I'm also a businessman, and I'm willing to get rid of those tapes, each and every one of them."
"And that's why we're here-- giving you three a chance to repent, forgive yourselves."
"And how do we do that, you snake?"
I think a million dollars will help you heal and cleanse that darkness you've gotta be carrying with you.
Bastard.
You can cover that.
"No, I know how this works."
"- Oh, do you?"
- Mm-hmm.
"Once we pay you, then in three more months, we hear from you again looking for more money to keep quiet."
We were acting in self-defense.
Self-defense?
"Mutilating, chopping up a lifeless body, that's self-defense?"
You three are crazier than I thought.
I made you all an offer.
I keep my word.
What are you gonna do?
911.
What's your emergency?
CHEERING
Tonight on 8 Out of 10 Cats.
"Our Pointless friend, it's Richard Osman!"
"She's having a laugh, it's Ellie Taylor!"
"And their team captain, Rob Beckett!"
And facing them tonight.
"Acting funny, it's Jessica Knappett!"
"Here for the craic, it's David O'Doherty!"
"And their team captain, Aisling Bea!"
Ruins with artifacts that have this kind of power are all over the world.
Spriggan!
What's that?
Look!
The ark!
Damn...
It's over.
Wake up Ominae!
you jerk.
Jean.
What?
I'm way too easy going.
I can still see that brat's dying face in my mind.
but that's what I like about you.
What did you say?
Just shut up hang on.
What's that?
!
That is the true figure of the ark.
The ark is breaking up!
It can't be!
We couldn't even scratch the thing!
Something must have been activated to have caused this!
Four thousand years of time... and returned to the void.
what about Yu and Jean?
look.
Yu!
You're alive!
The King's New Grammar School in Stratford upon Avon... where over 400 years ago a young lad named William Shakespeare... poured over his classical literature and history... and began to learn about the great names and events that had shaped the world.
"Today, Stratford has changed."
It's still the cozy market town of Shakespeare's day... but it has also become the epicenter of the 'Shakespeare World'.
- Who wants him dead?
- No questions.
Take it or leave it.
- 1 .5 million.
- Seems high.
This is my last hatchetjob.
"All right, it's a deal."
Money's no object.
These guns are clean.
No serial numbers.
Untraceable.
Explosive head bullets.
Your favorite.
"Easy to pick up, hard to put down."
Want to change your mind?
Why take thisjob?
Ifshe doesn't have a cornea transplant soon... she might lose her sight forever.
There's a cornea bank in Hong Kong... but it's always empty.
"When a donation does come in, someone else gets it first."
So we're going to try abroad.
I have to leave you for a few days.
"When I return, I'll take you overseas for surgery."
"You will come back, right?"
I promise.
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.
Many VIPs and government officials will attend the opening ceremony.
You are assigned to protect them.
Their information is in your files.
Make sure you're extra alert!
"Yes, sir!"
"Tony Weng, we're protecting that scum."
Attention please!
"So he makes Jackson kill Isaac's dad, one of argent's hunters, and the mechanic working on your jeep?"
Why?
Because... he's evil.
You just don't like him.
The guy...
Bugs me.
I don't know what it is.
Just look at his face.
Any other theories?
You okay?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Are you all right?
"Hey, you don't look so good."
I just need to get some water.
No one leaves their seats.
Stiles says you know how Jackson's parents died.
Maybe.
Talk.
It was a car accident.
"My dad was the insurance investigator, and every time he sees Jackson drive by in his Porsche, he makes some comment about the huge settlement he'll be getting when he's 18."
"So not only is Jackson rich now, but he's getting even richer at 18?"
There's something so deeply wrong with that.
You know what?
I could try to find the insurance report on my dad's in-box.
He keeps everything.
"Scott McCall, please report to the principal's office."
"I'm fine, just give me a minute."
Perfect.
Don't forget the dates.
"""Passengers arrived at the hospital doa."
The estimated time of death...
"9:26 P.M., June 14, 1995."""
"Jasmine, please keep your hands off your partner's buttocks!"
Some of the girls are getting restless
Someone has to stay upstairs.
"Fine, you can take one couple downstairs but make sure you send people up to replace them."
You look....
Are you having fun?
"Yeah, it's great but, aren't you freaking out, a little bit?"
You're president of the sorority now.
- It's a pretty big decision.
- Not at all.
I did what I had to do and it's working just fine.
Relax!
I am!
Can I borrow your lovely sister for a moment?
- You really pulled it off
- I couldn't have done without you.
What now?
"I say if you can slip away, we see what the real party's like."
Hopefully it's some more of your naughty little clappers.
Dean Bowman?
What a surprise!
Come on in.
You're here!
I'm so glad!
How can I refuse an invitation to a party of the infamous Kappa Taus.
- Mind if I look around?
- Not at all!
Let me have your coat.
"You know what, Cappie..."
Cappie can take his coat.
Who invited dean Bowman?
Me.
At ease.
The lieutenant will be with us a week or so until the Krauts ship him to the officers' camp.
Seems like all the rail road lines are fouled up.
Somebody blew up an ammunition train.
"Somebody, my eye."
The lieutenant did it.
Right in the station with 50 German guards around.
Glad to have you with the organization.
"Yeah, you're just in time for the Christmas pageant."
Looks more like the lost company of Tobacco Road.
He's an actor.
You should see him do imitations.
He can imitate anybody.
Do Lionel Barrymore again.
- Do Alan Ladd.
-Do Cary Grant.
"Hey, do Grable."
"Now, see here, Scarlet I'm crazy about you and always have been."
I gave you kisses for breakfast kisses for lunch and kisses for supper.
- And now I find that you're eating out.
Ha-ha-ha.
"Not Gable, Grable."
That's enough.
They were shot down two days ago and they've been on their feet ever since.
Price here will show you to your bunks.
"Fix them some tea, huh?"
We had a couple of unexpected vacancies.
Which will it be?
Upper or lower?
"Uh, it doesn't matter, just so I can get some sleep."
- Lieutenant Dunbar?
- Yeah.
Aside from our difference in age.
Hey... of course we are!
And I look young for my age...
I keep being told that I look young for my age.
It's really... difficult to be modest these days.
"As scary as Park Seon Woo can be, don't underestimate us either."
"Because, we're all friends."
That man doesn't have any friends.
I know him well.
"Oh, but Shi Yoon."
- There's something you must do for me.
- What?
Since I have to meet Han Gyul tomorrow...
"Please teach me the most important, or the most basic, element of fighting."
"Hey, Im Soo Bin!"
I heard that your dad was in a chase in our neighborhood yesterday.
Except he wasn't the one chasing.
He was being chased.
- Wasn't your dad a police officer?
"- Shut up, and keep stuffing your face."
Oh!
We should have recorded the chase and put it on the web!
"I would have gotten 10,000 ""likes""!"
Get a horde of fans!
And it would climb up the internet search engine rankings!
Soo Bin!
What's that?
Blood?
"Oh, spicy rice cakes?"
- Did you fight someone?
- Did you kill someone?
I'm asking you if you killed someone!
"For example, once, when Charlie and I were at camp..."
"... Ilostmy swimtrunks,andI had  to wear an old pair of Charlie's, and..."
... Ijustcouldn'tenjoy the pool at all.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm a pair of used swim trunks?
"No, no. ln this case, I think you would be the pool."
Maybe this was a bad idea.
"No, no, it's a great idea."
It's right up there...
"... withthewheel,fireandrefrigerators that give ice through the door."
-Sorry. I don't wanna do this anymore.
-What?
Why?
You can't be with me without it being some competition with your brother.
It's not a competition.
"And even it was, shouldn't we do it first before you decide who wins?"
You are unbelievable.
-That could be taken a couple of ways.
-Get out.
"Well, no ambiguity there."
Don't forget your brother's CD.
My eye!
"Man, I love sunsets."
The way the sky is streaked with color.
It's amazing.
"It's the pollution that makes those pretty colors, you know."
What you're enjoying is the effect of light passing through airborne poison.
"No, that's not what I'm really enjoying."
"Boy, I hope that's guacamole."

They're doing the best they can.
No.
I'm not griping about how they're treating the Deucalion.
I've just... given up on them.
On us?
On the Martians.
"The war's going in their favor a little bit, and they're wildly misinterpreting it."
That's terrifying.
I will drain the therapeutic fluid and bring Princess Asselyum to my castle.
Tell no one of this.
"Not even Princess Lemrina, of course."
- But why not-.
- Do as I say!
Forgive me.
I did not mean to startle you.
No visitors are allowed?
My sister's condition is that serious?
She...
Perhaps it was a miracle that she held on for this long.
How much time does she have?
Today?
Tomorrow?
They say that they still do not know.
It is just as possible that she will remain in this condition indefinitely.
I see...
I can guess what you are feeling.
"You may have mixed feelings, but she is your only sibling by blood."
"It is you who are truly sad, aren't you, Slaine?"
I must go.
Slaine...
"I forgive you, Slaine."
Even if you cry in front of me today.
"I already work with the greatest detective in the world, and I cannot wait to get back home to her."
"But, sir, you should seriously consider Kendall for membership."
She is one hell of a detective and sneaky in all the right ways.
You're sure about this?
"Absolutely, sir."
"You just keep getting more and more interesting, Mr. Castle."
I'm gonna have to keep an eye on you.
Hayley: [Sighs] Okay.
Are you not packed?
I can't do it.
Pack you clothes?
Walk away.
"Hayley, I need to know what happened to me."
"Okay, there's one last thing."
"Just before you left to get your memories erased, you came to me with one final request."
Like what kind of request?
"That if you demanded to know the truth,"
I show you this.
What is this?
"It's a, uh, secret website on the dark web."
What's on it?
Not a clue.
You installed a password that only you would know.
"Called it ""Blair's combination."""
From a short story I wrote when I was 17.
Never saw the light of day.
What was that combination?
4 left... 17 right... 21 left.
[Beeps]
I'll step out.
"No, no."
"You've, um..."
I started imagining the future.
I felt everything fell apart.
As Clara was talking...
I felt more afraid.
"Without noticing, I repeated several times:"
"""I won't know how to live alone""."
One of them got Clara mad.
And she said:
"""You've always lived alone!"""
That I should be used to it already.
That even in those moments I was incapable of saying that I couldn't live without her.
That I only thought of myself.
You didn't think of me?
We'll talk about you later.
And what did you two say about me?
I remember telling Clara that I wanted to see you more often.
We discussed some issues concerning you.
And why didn't you ask me?
You were too little.
How long ago?
Two years?
More.
Three?
Would had you preferred to live with me?
No.
Then we decided right.
Yes.
"Not long ago, a girl wrote a letter to Max."
But then she broke it.
You tell me why.
If you interrupt me I lose the inspiration.
The letter said:
"Uh, I-"
You were the one that trained me in the delicate art of giving people useless information.
"I said nice things, for what it's worth."
Thank you.
You have a job for me?
A woman I met.
Evelyn.
She heard I worked security.
She asked me for help.
I guess her ex ran off with their son.
"We ran checks, credit cards, airlines, got nothing."
"Somebody's gonna have to do some legwork... but a job that small, not really our thing."
You thought of me.
"I would consider it a favor if you took the job,and the money's not bad."
- Money's not the pressing issue.
- Why?
What do you need?
- Identity.
- Not for traveling.
"Michael, if you leave Miami-"
I can't help you with that kind of thing.
Seriously.
Lucy.
Lucy.
Fine.
"Get your documents together, I'll have my guys do an I.D. package."
Go see Evelyn first.
Thanks.
I separated from Doug a few months ago.
"I tried to keep it together forJasper's sake, but-That's our son."
But it was hard on him listening to us fight all the time.
He started acting up at school.
"- All right, I'll use my own."
Oops-a-daisy.
- That is adorable.
Where did you get that?
- Vending machine at a rest stop.
- Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.
And stay on your phone for logistical support as planned.
"Now come on, guys, let's get ready."
"- Hey, we never really got a chance to say hi."
- Yeah.
Hi.
- Hi.
"- Oh, my God, everyone,"
Jake and Amy are going to kiss for the first time in six months.
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.
- So everyone's just gonna watch us?
- Yes!
"Now get to it, you lovebirds."
Here we go.
"- Come on, man."
- How did you get there so fast?
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.
- Welcome to the Fun Zone.
"I know the manager, and he's agreed to shut the place down for the day, so there won't be any civilians around."
- Smart.
You put up all these fake signs about a major health code violation.
"- No, those are actually always there-- something about lead being in the air and water and ground."
"Anyways, you all have your assignments."
Let's plan an ambush.
Nine-Nine!
I'm off duty.
I hope it isn't serious.
I don't know.
They're doing some tests but they won't tell me anything either.
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Abidjan, the Yemen, Brazil,"
"Turkey, Cuba."
- I'll read them to Alicia at night.
- They're just travel guides.
"You wrote them, they must be special."
- Are you going alone?
- Yes.
I wanted to talk to you about that before you leave.
- About what?
- Loneliness.
I want to get married.
Married?
Who to?
"To Alicia, of course!"
You're crazy!
We get along better than most married couples.
Why shouldn't a man want to marry the woman he loves?
Because the woman is in a coma!
"Because Alicia can't say with any part of her body: ""I do!"""
Because we don't know if vegetative life is really life!
Get in the car.
- How can you say that?
- Get in the car!
Your relationship with Alicia is a monologue and it's insane.
I'm not saying talking's no use but people talk to plants and they don't marry them!
I can't believe you're saying that.
I thought you were different.
The invasion.
But it never came.
"Stanley, voice-over:"
I don't know why you're kidding yourselves.
The Jewish plot-- everyone knows it's not true.
Stanley.
"No, dad."
I'm fed up with it.
I'm fed up with the lot of them.
"If the Germans were going to invade, they'd have been here days ago."
Foyle:
"No invasion, and you panicked."
"You were going to be found out after all, and you decided to..."
Take the easy way out.
Yes.
I wanted to kill myself.
"And Stanley destroyed your suicide note, understandably."
"A fascist for a mother, a killer for a father-- not shining examples of parental guidance."
No wonder he was reading Freud.
What will happen to me?
"You'll be tried for murder, Arthur."
"I loathed her, you know..."
And the scum she brought to the hotel.
Didn't give you the right to kill her.
Please tell Stanley I'm sorry.
Tell him...
I wish I'd been a better father.
I think he knows.
Yes.
"Milner, sit down."
Congratulations on the arrest.
"Ellis has signed a full confession, so I suppose that's that."
- You ever been in this room before?
- Yeah.
Organic Chemistry in my freshman year.
- How'd you do?
"- Well, I got an A."
- Professor Rosa...
"- Micky, please."
Is there a problem with my paper?
"Well, you found a more efficient method for finding true zero than Isaac Newton and that, my friend, is not so much of a problem as it is a major ass-kicking."
"Although Newton has been dead for over 250 years, so it wasn't exactly a fair fight."
"So, is this some kind of a math club?"
"Don't be rude, people."
- Kianna.
- Fisher.
- Choi.
- Jill.
- You ever studied blackjack?
- No.
"No, really?"
"Well, it's really simple, actually."
You play against the dealer.
You're given two cards.
Face cards are worth 10 points.
The closest to 21 wins.
"If you go over, you lose."
"If the dealer goes over, they lose."
It's the most popular card game in the world.
It's a game with memory.
"Cards drawn are the past, ones to come are future."
"And the best part, it's beatable."
Are you talking about counting cards?
No.
And no one leaves until I check surveillance.
"Yes, ma'am."
"All right, let's go."
Go?
No.
We got this.
"No, clearly, you're shorthanded."
"I appreciate your help, Agent DiNozzo, but airport surveillance is for TSA and our eyes only."
"That's Homeland's rules, not mine."
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
"Look, delays are bad enough, but now the bathrooms?"
Do you know who I am?
"There's something going on here, and you are not telling us."
"Folks, please, there's no cause for alarm."
Passenger just had a medical issue in there.
Excuse me.
I'm a doctor.
Can I help?
Ah.
"thank you, Doctor."
"No, we've got everything under control."
That's a sharp suit.
Kudos to your tailor.
"But... everyone, can I have your attention?"
"Thank you for your patience, but we do have a medical emergency, so in the spirit of the holiday, can we all just have a good wish--"
"- Give it a rest, you pretty boy!"
"- Excuse me,"
I don't think that's necessary.
"You cram it, too!"
"Appreciate the help, Doc."
- Nice suit.
Great.
"But hey, look, with Hank, maybe it'll be different, you know?"
He's a cop.
He's already seen a bunch of crazy stuff.
"With any luck, it'll wear off in a couple, three years."
[Inaudible dialogue]
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Camera shutter clicking]
[Phone rings] Hello.
I found your friend.
Marquesa.
It's time for you to get on a plane to Portland.
Thanks.
You don't look like you slept too well.
I didn't.
What's going on?
"The usual suspects, tossing and turning."
Must have been something I ate.
What did you get from Interpol?
File on Akira Kimura.
"Ah, yeah."
One of the guys responsible for killing your parents.
It's a great way to start your day.
"And get this, they tied him to the beating death of a coin collector in hamburg."
Turns out the victim was the dealer who sold the three gold coins to Sam Bertram here in Portland.
I'm not sad those coins disappeared.
"You know, that's a nasty-looking guy."
The hell is that thing on his face?
It's called the Aegishjalmur.
And it means what?
Helm of awe.
It's a symbol the vikings wore for invincibility.
I hear that you're a high school history teacher?
- How is that?
"- Where have you been, Isobel?"
I don't have any reasons that are gonna comfort you.
I don't have any explanations that are gonna satisfy you.
I wanted this.
- It's that simple?
- Yeah.
You were supposed to mourn me and move on.
You were my wife.
And I loved you.
How could I not search for you?
"Because I wasn't lost, Ric."
"I understand that you know my daughter, Elena."
And I hear that she's been looking for me.
So I want you to arrange for a meeting with us.
"You want me, ahem, to deliver a message?"
Yeah.
Screw you.
You selfish bitch.
[CAR ALARM CHIRPS]
[WHOOSHING]
What do you want from me?
- I told you.
- I'm not gonna do anything for you.
[ALARIC GRUNTING]
You better tell Elena that I wanna meet.
Or I'm gonna start killing the citizens of this town one by one.
And I'm gonna start with your History students.
Got it?
I'm supposed to help build the Miss Mystic float for the Founder's Day Parade.
"If I don't, I get the wrath of Caroline."
"- Yes, you did."
- I came to tell you the truth.
- You don't owe me an explanation.
Allison didn't leave home because of Nellie's suicide but because she hated me.
- She won't answer my letters or calls.
- Why not?
"The night you walked out, Marion Partridge called me."
She told me Allison and Norman...
I heard about that woman and her phone calls.
"Well, I've always been so afraid of scandal."
I believed Marion.
I believed that phone call.
"Without thinking, when Allison returned, I told her some terrible things."
What things?
"Come on, Connie, what things?"
"I'm Allison's mother, but I've never been married."
"Not to Angus MacKenzie, not to anyone."
I went to New York and lived with a married man.
"After he died, I came back here and lied and I've been lying ever since."
"You want the truth and when you get it, you're just like everybody else."
- They want anything but the truth.
- Connie.
Connie!
I told you once that the offer was always open.
"That I'm committing myself to you all the way and that I plan to worry about you, and take care of you."
I meant that.
"Oh, Michael."
- How's that?
- Fine.
I'll get it.
- Merry Chris...
- Ain't you gonna invite me in?
- How are classes going?
- Tough.
Physics.
"- Oh, physics is tough."
"- It's not the work, it's the students."
"A student, to be exact."
- My back.
Personal growth is so painful.
"- My son, doing manual labor?"
I never thought I'd live to see the day.
"Hey, Mom."
Check out this ironic twist of events.
"- Ryan is now a science nerd, I'm working a blue-collar job."
"- That's nice, honey."
- Mom?
"- Oh, Seth, don't worry."
"Your grandfather's situation is very serious, but your father and I are handling it."
Right.
Grandpa.
"To tell you the truth, I haven't even like... um..."
"- .. slept well the past couple nights, so concerned have I been for his well-being."
- But everything is going to be okay?
Right.
- Right?
- Right.
"And what, if Grandpa, like, he did have to go to some white-collar prison with tennis and TiVo, then...?"
"- Don't worry, Seth, it won't affect you."
- He wouldn't lose the company?
- No.
- What about the house?
- Son.
That's crazy talk.
Have faith.
We have no choice.
Crossing the Adriatic on this?
- You do not have to continue complaining.
I'm not complaining.
I'm realist.
Mr Moreau?
- Yup?
"The palace will pay me back for the boat, right?"
"But of course, Mr. Lloyd."
- I spent all I had.
The west is from that side.
"At sea, the most direct route is always a curve, sire."
"Tell me a little, do you still have a future in Belgium?"
"I mean, why split a peanut into two?"
Diplomacy and moderation
"They must lead us to the compromise, Mr. Lloyd."
Maybe we should split it and that's enough.
Wonders say they are tired.
"She is tired, Mr. Moreau?"
- I'm tired...
Of simplifications and stereotypes.
"Carlos, tell me a stereotype."
Wonders are lazy and take advantage of it.
Mr Moreau?
- The Flemish are arrogant.
He did not hear you.
- The Flemish are arrogant.
Why do not we look at the positive side?
Are There Stereotypes Positive?
Wonders are warmer.
More warm as people.
"Ms. Ramsey, uh, would you say that you and your niece"
Are close?
"Oh, of course we are."
But she's my sister's only daughter.
"And, uh, now that Stephen is..."
"Well, now that Stephen is dead,"
She's the only family I have left.
How did Stephen and his sister get along?
"Oh, just fine."
They were as close as any brother
And sister I've ever seen.
Why do you ask?
"No particular reason, Ms. Ramsey."
"Uh, we just have to ask a lot of questions"
When we're checking out a possible homicide.
Homicide?
What are you talking about?
I thought it was an accident.
I read it in the newspapers.
"Well, yes, it may appear that way, ma'am."
"But, you see, we have to, uh, check out everything,"
Every possibility.
It must have been an accident.
Run over by a car?
"Uh, that's the way it appears, yes, ma'am."
"Well, if it wasn't, then someone wanted Stephen dead."
"Oh, that's ridiculous."
"I don't believe that boy had, uh, an enemy in the world."
RICHARD:
Seems like everyone we talk
To feels about the same way.
"And then, of course, the next question is, who"
What stark had for breakfast two months ago.
Mm-hmm.
You feel him sweat?
Wife's the key.
Stay on the wife.
"Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet..."
I'm afraid I mistakenly took your stolen-car report.
"Well, thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen."
"Unless you're going to arrest and charge me,"
I'll be on my way.
"If there's anything further you'd like to discuss,"
Please feel free to contact one of mr.
Stark's attorneys.
Do you have any idea how stupid that was?
I didn't...
exactly.
You didn't think.
"For the love of eve, will somebody tell me what I did,"
Who I cheesed off to have you dumped in my lap?
Why you never catch any actual assignments.
Hey.
You see this man?
"He did exemplary work today, and you ruined it."
"Now, what do you have to say to him?"
"Agent thompson, I apologize."
"Agent carter, sorry doesn't even begin to cover it."
Doesn't even begin to cover it.
Get out of my sight.
Sir.
♪ you see me when you please ♪
♪ and think it's right ♪
♪ that I should stay at home every night ♪
How are you?
I'm okay.
I was gonna call you.
Then I saw you were coming for the parent-teacher conferences.
I want you to know the school is not gonna be bullied by Nick McCullers.
Everybody here loves Emily.
What about Nick McCullers?
"Uh, well, he came in making a big deal about how he thinks Emily's getting special treatment because she's gay."
Everybody knows Emily's the better swimmer.
Except McCullers.
He came here to school and said that?
In front of everyone.
"Students, teachers."
- Was Emily there?
- She was.
Hello?
Hello?
You better put that back.
Put it back or she'll know you were in here.
I'm sorry.
I knocked.
The door was open.
"I heard you, but I couldn't answer the door."
I was on the phone.
My lawyer called.
The DA is dropping the charges against me.
They're not gonna charge you with killing Alison?
I didn't get the details but he said the blood evidence was corrupted.
The district attorney can't go to trial without it.
- They're finished with you?
- Not finished.
They can charge me anytime they find new evidence.
This is the center of the collection.
You'll find this in the Main Room.
All the artworks are to be removed and all of them handled with the utmost care.
"You'll enter the property at midnight, on my command."
Is that clear?
"Yes, sir!"
Alright.
Good evening.
"Good evening, everyone!"
"Ok, let's not stand on ceremony, let's jump straight in with"
item number one in your catalogue:
"""A drive around the circuit in Monaco"", beginning bidding at... 50 thousand!"
"Now don't be shy, do we see 50 thousand?"
50!
Do I see 55?
55!
I see 55...
Do I see 60?
Your hand up?
Do we see 60?
"Is that 70, sir, or wonderful hair. 70!"
That's gone to you.
Thank you very well!
Auctions can be pretty torrid affairs.
Yes!
"I believe the last time you and I saw each other, we were bidding on the Malevich."
"You won that one, I guess."
Have you still got that Mondrian:
"""Study In Composition number 2""?"
Red and Blue!
"Yes, of course, that's one of our favorites."
Constantine hung a Rauschenberg next to it and would talk about the unbroken tradition between the two.
Why would he call me?
"Even if he calls, I'm not ready to talk to him."
Please.
Don't get furious.
"Even when he had was blind, he was peaceful."
Now everything has turned upside-down.
Why are you telling me this?
Varun left for Kanyakumari all of a sudden.
He didn't share any further details.
He has not been picking my calls either.
I'm confused.
And worried.
So I called you.
"Sorry, aunt."
Don't call me hereafter regarding him.
I'll get it repaired.
"This Alphonse can fix all phones, don't worry."
Okay.
I'll leave.
Bye.
Welcome.
- Did you get any information?
No call from the number you mentioned got completed.
From Manoj's number?
Yes.
"Unless the call gets completed, I can't find the number Manoj has been dialling."
I checked the date you mentioned.
"After the 17th, there are no incoming or outgoing calls to and from the number."
"But before the 17th, calls have been made and received to and from a specific number."
I eve have it written down somewhere.
Here it is.
7599... 447333.
- Apology accepted.
"For God's sakes, you're the only woman for me, now hang up the fucking phone!"
"Listen, your skills are missed around here, Frank."
I need you.
"Oh, my God."
"So, how about you come see me at the airport tomorrow?"
It'll be great to have you back.
Yes!
Yes!
"Oh, God, yes!"
"All right, Frank."

"America is a nation of believers that is being led by a group of censors, critics and cynics."
"All of the people telling you, ""You can't have the country you want,"""
are the same people that wouldn't stand...
"I mean, they said, ""Trump doesn't have a chance of being here tonight."""
"Oh, we love defeating those people, don't we?"
Don't we love defeating them?
"To all Americans tonight, I make this promise."
We will make America safe again.
"Oh, forget it."
Look.
"Where are all your weapons, Captain?"
Don't you display your weapons?
Trelane.
"Don't fret, Captain."
"I'm only a bit upset with you, but this Mr. Spockyou mentioned, the one responsible for that unseemly, impudent act of taking you from me, which is he?"
I'm Spock.
"Oh, surely not an officer."
"Isn't quite human, is he?"
My father is from the planet Vulcan.
And are its natives predatory?
Not generally.
But there have been exceptions.
"Oh, really?"
You will see to his punishment?
On the contrary.
I commend his action.
But I don't like him.
Get off my ship.
"Oh, rot!"
You're all going back with me.
We're not going anywhere.
Nonsense.
I have an absolutely enchanting sojourn on Gothos planned for you all.
You shan't spoil it for me.
"Anyway, the decor of my drawing room is much more appropriate and tasteful."
Don't you agree?
No.
"But so much more fitting, honorable sir."
You...
DeSalle.
"Ooh, I like him a lot."
"Just sign here, and your son will stand to inherit my entire estate."
Whoo-hoo!
We're rich.
"Bart, get over to the mansion and open up all the windows."
We want to get the old people smell out before we move in.
"- Dad, Mr. Burns hasn't passed away yet."
- Huh?
"Oh, right."
"So I guess you're in okay shape, huh?"
- No heart problems or anything?
"- Well, I--"
- Boo!
- [ Groaning ]
[ Groaning Continues ] I'm okay.
Now that you've all agreed to reap the windfall of my death...
"I must return to my large, empty mansion to rattle around... and await the inevitable alone."
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.
- Let's push him down the steps.
- No!
"You know, Bart, since he is giving you all of his money... maybe it would be nice if you spent some time with him."
- Well--
"- Come on, honey."
All right.
How come Bart gets to do that... and I can't spend one night lurking in the bushes outside Chef Boyardee's house?
"Bart, I know you children see me as some sort of""booger man""... but, uh, I'm really not such a bad... dude."
"Oh, your milk's gone cold."
I'll ring for the maid.
- Whoa!
[ Muffled Grunting ]
"- Oh, sorry."
"Look, Evan, I thought a lot about it."
"Right, I just, with Trend..."
"Don't worry about Trend, he decided to deactivate."
That's convenient.
What about the other guys?
There's always gonna be guys that don't like you.
Not everyone likes me.
That's true.
Thanks.
I think you can't let the way people feel about you determine how you live your life.
You're my little brother.
I garantee you I got your back.
So trust me.
And take this back.
At least think about it.
What you doing now?
I'm heading to the house to celebrate Cappie's release from CRU jail.
I'm not gonna be able to make it.
More movies?
"Actually, no."
I'm going back to Omega Chi.
Are you kidding?
I belong there.
You can't run away 'cause things aren't perfect
So Evan wins?
I thought you said it wasn't a competition.
Are you forgetting?
It's the same Evan Chamber who fought me at Dopplers who humiliated my sister at the carnival.
I don't know what you want me to say.
Alright?
"There're 2 sides to every story, Evan can be a real decent guy."
Are you saying Casey deserved what he did to her?
Lovely!
"Wolfie'll check out this tart you've been boning, then."
- Good.
- Maybe Wolfie'll pull her.
- He won't do that because she loves me.
- She loves you?
I'm going to cry!
I mean...
- She loves to fuck me.
- Yeah...
Course she does.
"That evening at the Civic Hall,"
I hoped Neil would enlighten me about what I'd be up to next week.
"He'd never enlightened me about anything before, but you never know."
How was the newspaper?
Did you write anything?
"No, nothing boring like that."
"I'm on the internet most of the day, this afternoon I smashed old desks in a skip and then home at four."
Are we the oldest here?
Possibly.
It's even more shit than I knew it would be.
I honestly don't why you came.
- To see you get blown out by Charlotte.
- Please try not to fuck this up.
"Charlotte asked me so there's a chance, admittedly a very slim chance, that she wants to pull me."
Or maybe she needs a mechanic for her car!
- Good one!
- I'd service her all right.
I'd slide my dipstick in deep!
"Thanks for coming, really appreciate it!"
I'm gonna find Charlotte.
Up to you.
It should fetch millions.
Money?
Is that all that it means to you?
Money bought me my title.
This estate.
And now it'll help me go down in history as the discoverer of the Treasure of Atlantis.
"Sorry, co-discoverer."
You think you can buy your way into the history books?
I wouldn't be the first.
Come in.
Anybody.
"Answer me, please?"
"Come in, this is an emergency."
Have a sherry to celebrate.
"I may be forced to work with you, but don't expect me to enjoy it."
"Please, professor, spare me the hypocrisy."
You and I are two of a kind.
"Now, Zavros, he only wants the money to fund his little revolution in Macedonia."
"But you and I share the same dream, to find the Treasure of Atlantis, no matter what it takes, or what the cost."
Go on.
Kelly.
Miss Carson.
"Hey, now, there's no need to be rough with her."
"If she's here, so is MacGyver."
General Zavros is right.
Where is MacGyver?
Answer him.
Tell us where MacGyver is.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
"Kelly, I-I do think you should answer them."
I don't betray my friends.
I'll make her talk.
"If you disagree, I'll file an emergency appeal."
We'll drag this thing out forever.
We can talk about it all day if you want.
"Okay, okay."
Okay.
Okay.
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Your Honor... we respectfully ask for time to consider filing a motion to preclude this testimony.
I respectfully deny your request.
Get Mr. Corey in here.
Now!
So I got to put my ass in the hot seat now?
- He has nothing.
- [click]
Really?
"You sure of that, huh, Donald?"
I am.
What if he does have something?
- [click]
- Huh?
You know what I suggest?
I'd suggest we give these fuckers
$10 million and get this over with now.
"Try not to be stupid, Wendell."
Lord knows you're capable of it.
And don't go weak on me after all I've done for you.
[scoff] Donald--
After all you've done for me.
- [clicking]
- You condescending asshole.
How about the nearly billion dollars in fees we've paid you over the years?
"When you illegally tested and developed items to get a jump on the market,"
My adorable... adorable... cat... cat...
Go by yourself.
Good...bye...
"Please leave the rest to me, Sasaoka."
"Bake Neko, I know your Makoto and your Kotowari."
I finally know everything.
Your Makoto... and your Kotowari is known...
The sword... shall be unsheathed!
UNSHEATHE.
I have seen enough of how you act.
I won't fear you anymore.
I won't be intimidated by this scene and this bloodlust.
"Brace yourself, I won't forgive you!"
Vanish!
Won't it be bothered resting by this mansion?
It would probably want to be near Tamaki-san.
I hope it'll get to live with Tamaki-san this time around.
It's the end for this house.
"The thing that I have been protecting, it has been destroyed..."
I did not lie to you.
I told you the Makoto.
Is that so?
That is the Makoto behind you?
The thing that you were trying to protect.
Take a good look at it.
What are you going to do from now on?
Where are you going now?
That's not something that you should be asking me.
"Odajima-sama, isn't that the thing you are thinking the most about right now?"
I am thinking of going back to my old village.
I can't stay here any more.
As for me...
-Yes.
"And you're Brandon Bourne, aren't you?"
"The seventh, or ninth, or something?"
Only the third.
How do you know?
Your wife comes into the store quite often.
Everyone likes her.
"I like her, too."
"Since you know I'm married,"
I suppose you wouldn't consider sitting down with me for your ginger ale?
Sure.
I'm curious about guys like you.
Yeah?
"-John, this reserved?"
"-Always for you, Mr. Bourne."
"One ginger ale, one Scotch over rocks, please."
"Yes, sir."
"What are you curious about, with guys like me?"
"-Well, doesn't your wife dance?"
-Brilliantly.
Yeah.
"She's prettier than I am, she dresses better, and she's probably a lot smarter."
"Everything I can do, chances are she can do better."
"So, what do you want to be sitting here with me for?"
What is it with guys like you?
What goes on in your fuzzy little heads?
"What do you want, my philosophy of marriage?"
"-Well, I'm a reformed character myself."
-Oh.
"No, really."
"But before I reformed,"
I suppose my thinking went something like this.
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?
We took those photos less than an hour ago.
Why is the size of the haematoma in that scan... three times the size of the one in this man's skull?
It's like the whole mess is healing itself at warp speed.
"The home number was unlisted, but Rickman was in the ER last year... with a badly cut finger, and his wife had a Pap smear."
Dr. Willock.
"Dr. Willock, excellent."
And who's taking care of this fellow now?
"It's not Dr. Stegman, is it?"
No.
Steg isn't in.
I believe Hook.
Hook?
Excellent.
- Do you think so?
"- Yes, indeed."
You say this Peter Rickman is quite well-known?
Yes.
"In fact, here."
"I included this, in case you hadn't seen it."
I see.
"Thank you, Brenda."
"Quick work, and even quicker thinking."
Thank you for this.
"Here, take this, and one of these... and, of course, one of these, for your car window."
Aren't they wonderful?
Aren't they really excellent?
Very nice.
"Jesse, if this works out, the Rickmans are in a position... to give Kingdom Hospital a great deal of help."
"Filthy rich, are they?"
"- I don't know if I'd say that, exactly, but..."
"- No, but just between us?"
"And Lil Wayne be looking at him from the back, he be..."
"""Yeah."
"What you doing on the ground, lil nigga?"""
¶ What you on the ground for ¶
¶ Weezy F baby.
¶ Please say the baby.
¶ Ridin' with your bitch.
¶ Got keys on the lady.
¶ Bitches and strippers.
¶ And strippers and strippers and bitches ¶
¶ Bitches and strippers and money ¶
¶ That's all I talk about.
"""Yeah!"""
"I like Lil Wayne, but we all must concur in this building this evening."
"That man look like a big-ass cricket, don't he?"
It's like he call girls in the club like this.
¶ Come here baby.
¶ I wish I could chirp every girl in the world ¶
¶ Young money yeah
"I'm just saying, man."
"What Wayne has done is he's brought a lot of people together musically, and that's what we need, baby."
'Cause discrimination is the deterioration to our nation.
Huh?
"All I'm saying is you white, I'm Black."
That don't mean we can't sleep together.
It just means the baby gonna look like Barack.
That's all the hell it means.
"If you're Asian, we can make Tiger Woods."
"If you're Spanish, we can make Victor Cruz."
"If you're Indian,"
I guess our children gonna open up the first chains of Subways and KFCs put together.
"And if you're really white, like really white, like..."
"Look, we know that having a deep pocket means that sometimes you get subjected to extortion."
It happens.
But for them to saddle up a child-- the child of a suicide victim--
Where does it stop?
"Well, at the end of this case,"
I hope it stops there.
You can go... prop.
"Ryan never talked about what he was working on, but I knew it made him very unhappy."
He was very stressed.
"Now, did he ever talk about killing himself?"
No.
Never.
"After he died, that's what Borns Tech told me happened, and I believed them."
Why did you believe them?
"Shock, anger."
I wasn't thinking clearly.
"It was easier to blame Ryan somehow,"
- and I regret that.
- Right.
You weren't thinking clearly.
Hmm.
But clearly well enough to take an enormous settlement from Borns Tech.
I had my son to consider.
You told us that Ryan was unhappy and stressed.
At work.
Not at home.
"I mean, everything okay with you two at home."
Yes.
Pretty much.
Was he unhappy or stressed about anything between the two of you?
No.
It's your last chance to come clean.
Please don't turn me into one of those things that make it harder.
Mr.Cole?
South from downstairs.
"I'm not the ""War""."
"I'm not the ""Committee""."
I would it better.
Mrs.Cole?
Hello Alf.
Heavy rescue.
They want to know how many number in cellar 12.
Alright.
"When the twins got to Dunkirk, they did whatever every other small boats did."
Ferry troops off the beach and onto the big ships waiting in the deeper water.
"They were shelling' and drafin', but they honestly didn't talk about that."
What really seems to have stuck with them are the details.
The little authentic details...
There's a soul Joe with the dog in his kit-bag.
"Umm, the Frenchman that tried to kiss Lilly."
"I wish I could make you understand, how awfully brave they were..."
"Their father's a bully, I think."
A bit of a drunk.
"They're terrified of him, but, they took his boat anyway."
"""The Nancy""."
The Nancy?
"""The Nancy Starling""...after their mother."
The nail on the head!
Hm?
Wonderful.
"Authenticity, optimism and a dog!"
"I imagine, call ups left quite a hole in the ranks."
"So, in the interests of a quick turn around, we'll let you have some of our people."
"Mrs.Cole, Ms.Moore, hmm-umm,"
"it gives me pause, Lutie, to see him."
There's such a lot of recklessness under that crazy charm.
There's a danger in him and a kind of violence.
it's hard for me to keep my hands off.
"Sometimes, when he looks at me as we pass and it's never more than a flick of his eye i feel that he must know something and that he must hate me for it."
i understand Sarah Beth graduated last week with high honors.
Sarah Beth Brewton.
Hazel Sawyer.
BRlCE:
They tell me she'ii be home soon.
"i wonder how Sait Fork will seem to her now, after her years of schooling."
BROCK:
"Pardon me, ma'am."
"I'm, uh, looking for a little sawed-off, freckled, ugly runt of a girl."
I'm looking for a handsome young gentleman.
"Well, you found what you're looking for, but how about me;"
You went and changed on us.
"-Oh, Brock."
"-Hello, Sarah Beth."
Where's Papa;
Papa.
Papa.
"Good to see you, Sarah Beth."
"Oh, I might've known you'd be like this, both of you."
-Like what;
"-Oh, good-looking."
"A couple of years do a lot for a young lady, don't they;"
"Well, what did you expect;"
"Of me, I mean."
"Not as much as we got, eh, Brock;"
"Not half. I don't know, though, looks stuck up to me."
-Probably won't like our town anymore.
With a knife.
"All right, I'm gonna tell you something, kiddo."
I woke up last night thinking about it.
I couldn't sleep at all.
"First I thought, ""Who am I gonna talk to?"""
"And then I thought, ""Michelangelo."""
Because you're a good listener.
"I mean that, really."
But it's not an easy thing to talk about.
Because...
Well...
Maybe...
Maybe it was my fault what happened to Bonnie.
And Dorothy.
"Because you see, in a way, Minx wanted them dead."
"But a girl can't help her feelings, can she?"
That's all they were.
Private feelings.
Private thoughts.
I didn't really want it to...
You know.
"What do you think, Michelangelo, honestly?"
Do you think I made a mistake with my career?
"You see when I was born mother decided I was to be something respectable, reliable."
"So you can imagine, when I started playing with dolls, mother started crying day and night."
It was a nightmare.
And that's when I began to dream of being a psychiatrist.
To stop mother from crying.
"And then one day, a man told me I was beautiful, asked me if I wanted to be in a commercial."
"Big hair, big eyelashes, big fur."
Vodka.
It was a big success.
"I shall remember that, sir."
"""...change our vile body, that it may be like His according to the working whereby He can subdue all things to Himself."""

Turn forward and...
"Stand by, all hands."
"I haven't time for assembly, so this serves a second purpose."
Stand by to witness punishment.
All hands to witness punishment.
Two dozen.
- Just for looking at him.
- Stow it!
- Commence the punishment!
- Start the roll!
Keep low.
She'll take off our masts.
She'll lop them off!
Keep down.
Keep down.
"Goss, are you there?"
I'm...
"Boy, where's Mr. Goss?"
"On deck, sir."
For the flogging.
Flogging?
I authorized no flogging.
Twenty-three!
Twenty-four!
"Punishment completed, sir!"
Two dozen lashes!
- Cut him down!
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Enjoy yourself?
"You see, Trixie, now that this young Tyler has brought more money into the play"
I shall arrange for you to have more to do.
- And you may become a star.
- A real star?
A great star.
Possibly as big as-as a planet.
"Well, where is she?"
Where's Miss Chummy?
"Well, I've called her twice, she's over there with the judge."
"Tell everybody else to go home, I'll attend to her."
Okay.
"Alright, Miss Chummy we'll go through that new number you've been telling me about."
- I brought my own piano player.
"- You wouldn't trust ours, heh?"
"Yes, but he knows all my routines."
"He does, huh?"
Mm-hmm.
[wailing]
"Listen, being that it's a new number today just for the sake of novelty, please try to sing the same notes what he plays."
"- Alright, ahem."
- Music.
[clears throat] [falsetto singing]
What have you got in your mouth?
Firecrackers?
Must you give out with that shrill gargling?
"Well, I'm a dramatic coloratura."
Coloratura?
Music.
[piano music]
* Fluttering chirping birds of spring *
* Come back to your home in the north and sing * [falsetto singing]
What do you think you're doing now?
Must have been quite an impression.
You did research on me?
Are you following me?
That day you bought me a drink so now you want chocolates for free?
Disgusting.
You are such a big business tycoon.
- I'd think you'd be able to afford them.
- Afford?
I can even afford a car.
But then how would I enjoy this walk with you?
How will this work if you too keep quiet?
I am already the silent type.
Who comes to a party and...
Personality problem.
Mysterious smile?
And I want to make chocolates.
Have our personalities exchanged?
"You're damn strange, man."
It's hard to figure you out.
That means you are trying to figure me out.
"Actually, yes."
Yes?
I think we should do business together.
- What say?
- No.
But liquor and chocolates get along.
- They do.
- So then?
It'll be difficult to focus.
For you.
Doesn't that sound like a Hindi song?
"""A girl walking in the rain."""
"All right, tie it off!"
Now look alive.
Mr. Petty...
You arrive to us with much fanfare.
I can assure you most lags don't get the benefit of a welcoming party.
"But then you are a special case, aren't you?"
A smile.
"On a child's face, it reminds us of all that's good and pure in this world."
"But on yours, it's all the company of Hades."

"No, the lady does not."
But nice thought.
Thank you.

For your nausea.

Emerson Hauser.
"She has good taste in music, Mr. Hauser."
Any improvement?
I'm sorry.
And if she stays here?
Did she ever talk to you about a DNR?
Are you saying she's dying?
"Guy, ready?"
"Oh, okay."
"Hey, buddy."
How you doing?
Where'd you come from?
"I have no problem with that, Mr. President, as long as we realize we are working against a clock."
I want all departments present to work up an open versus covert containment strategy and report back to me in 30 minutes.
"In the meantime, I want Health Services to issue guidelines, but only to be distributed internally."
That is all.
I'll be in my office.

"Give us a second, please, Aaron."
"Of course, sir."
Secret Service just received a phone call from the west Los Angeles police department.
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
He was found 15 minutes ago in his home.
All signs point to a heart attack.
It isn't possible.
"Well, apparently, it is."
You told me Sherry was on her way over there about an hour ago.
She changed her mind.
Made some phone calls from her car.
Came straight back here.
"David, is that what she told you?"
Yeah.
And where is she now?
Resting.
"Aaron, take me to Sherry."
"Yes, sir."
She's right this way.
Hasn't your shift ended?
I stayed on.
"I sense it's a difficult day, and I wanted to be here for you."
- I appreciate that.
"- Right in there, sir."
Sherry.
-You could have it.
-You took it first.
Excuse me.
"There are two copies, you both could have the same."
The bill counter is at the left corner.
You could pay the bill there
Your's sir.
- Thank you.
- Yours madam.

-Not made today?
Nothing is made today Didn't you see the board outside?

- Give me pongal?
- What you guys want for pongal?
"For pongal give us trousers and shirt, some pocket money."
I asked what you need as side dish?
As if you have eight-variety dishes?
Give me that same damn chutney.

I won't tell jokes to the neighbors.
The building is equipped for change.
"For instance, if you're in a westerly room and you're exposed to the setting sun, our computers increase the flow of air-conditioned air."
So your temperature is always perfect.
There's no comparable building anywhere.
How about that one?
"Oh, you know, that building doesn't look as tall."
Probably doesn't even have one computer.
"Honestly, I love it."
It'll be like living in the top drawer of a glass box.
I'll take it.
"Hello, little Cyclops."
Welcome to your new home.
"Don't forget, you're supposed to take the curse off the lonely nights."
Lonely nights and lonely days coming your way.
"Cut it out, Michaels."
"Hello, L.A."
This could be the start of a meaningful relationship.
Mr. Frimkin?
"Hello, I'm Leigh Michaels."
"Fine, thank you."
And you?
Yes.
"I worked at WXN, New York, for five years."
Uh-huh.
"I was born in Carthage, New York."
I'm 29 and I'm single.
"I hope that's not going to be a problem, Mr. Frimkin."
"- All right, listen up."
- [chuckles]
"I've decided to make some positive life changes, and I am giving up drugs, selling and using."
Fucking have at it.
- [Ron] Holy shit!
"- [Cassie] Oh, my God."
"- Oh, my God, Edgar."
- Take whatever you want.
"Edgar, there are children here."
What do you have in a nice house hallucinogen?
"I'm glad you asked--I have some acid, mescaline, and oh, my favorite organic hallucinogen of choice, mushrooms."
"Oh, hell yes."
- See you later.
- Yup.
[sighs] [knocks]
Yeah?
"Hey, uh, I need to know something."
What--what is your plan for me here?
We're working the plan.
"You're in the Cellar, honing your craft."
"No, my craft's already honed."
I'm killing it every night in the Cellar.
All right?
I need the Main Stage.
Jesus.
You kids and the Main Stage are like lemmings heading off a cliff.
"Well, how about a straight answer?"
"No chickens, no lemmings, no no struggle, just a straight fucking answer."
You hear Barton coming out of your mouth?
"You think 'cause some guy offers you the moon and the stars, he can actually deliver?"
Barton's offering cash...
- [scoffs] - ...and stage time
I feel like I ruined everything.
You didn't ruin anything.
Not a damn thing.
I want you to be happy.
"You didn'tsee it, did you?"
Yes.
Yeah?
She knew.
What?
She was drawing angels.
Two years later.
It was the meanness of the campaigns... the almost complete lack of candor and honesty... that turned the voters off..
I think that these parties are demonizing each other.
They're projecting our own personal fears and anxieties... onto the national stage.
People don't like it.
"People are very, very unsatisfied at the moment."
It makes them complacent because they don't see any possibility of change.
2004...
Is there a dark horse candidate out there for the Democrats?
"Well, I'm hearing a lot about Russ McCallum."
- Governor of Virginia.
"- Yeah, he might do what Carter..."
"Hey, I told her to watch."
Who?
Peter's friend Gwen.
She'll be there tonight.
"Oh, God."
"Look, I don't think I'm gonna be able to make that one tonight."
"Come on, you can't keep blowing this thing off."
I'm not.
I've got an interview with the governor.
I gotta be in Richmond at 8:00 in the morning.
"This is just like ""hairspray""!"
"Then the cops showed up, and it turned into a riot."
Whoa!
A riot?
Yeah.
Sweet!
Did anyone use nunchakus?
"You know, I don't think so,"
"But that riot was something else, and it reminded me..."
"So aunt Edie told them all about the riot,"
"The moon landing, and the time she saw elvis"
"Buying double ""a"" batteries at Wheeler's market."
Maybe Axl and Sue didn't find
"The time capsule they were looking for,"
But they ended up finding a better one.
"And it turns out,"
I had a little time capsule of my own.
"A file, mike?"
Someone seriously has a file on me?
How do I go from being a person teachers always loved
To a person with a file?
"Well, you know, maybe they didn't love you"
As much as you thought they did.
So what are we gonna do about this crossing guard thing?
"I take tuesdays, you take thursdays,"
And then we switch off?
"What do you mean ""we""?"
Hey.
I'm telling.
"'course you are, 'cause you're a narc."
"(This film is based on the true event of ""Wushe Incident"")"
I told you Schnickelfritz.
You made me bet on Equipoise.
I clocked him this morning.
He was running like a doll.
You clocked him!
Why don't I clock you?
Another one of his enterprises was the distillery.
He ran a bar right in our barracks selling schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.
The boys called it the ﬂamethrower but it wasn't really that bad.
"We brewed the stuff out of old potato peels and once in a while, a couple of strings off the red cross parcels just to give it a little ﬂavor."
"It ain't fair, Harry."
"I'm telling you, it ain't fair."
My Betty.
Ain't she beautiful?
She married an orchestra leader.
So what?
There's other women.
Not for me.
Betty.
- Betty.
"-Forget Betty, Animal."
I'll get you a date with some of those Russian women.
You'll get me a date?
Sure.
I'll get you into the Russian compound.
How?
Pinky Miller from Barracks 8 tried getting over there and they shot him in the leg.
"It takes a gimmick, Animal."
I figured us a little gimmick.
- You did?
-Sharp.
Sometimes I'm so sharp it's frightening.
I ran away from home to pursue my blue-collar aspirations.
I thought you looked familiar.
Got plans for mother's day?
I am taking my little boy to the amusement park.
It's supposed to be my day and he gets all the fun.
"That's okay, when he's older,"
I'll let him make it up to me.
A little guilt goes a long way.
How about you?
Cemetery.
"- Oh, I'm sorry."
- Thanks.
I lost mine too.
Still hurts.
I am not so good at losing family.
Who is?
What's weird is that it didn't hit until I picked out her burial dress.
I pictured her while buying it...
Not knowing it would...
"You know, be the one."
"Seems unfair, doesn't it?"
Not knowing things like that.
"Hey, how about spending the day with me and Nicolas after the cemetery?"
Sounds dreamy.
"Hey Reynolds, what did the Feds want you for?"
Armed robbery.
"Oh yeah, that's right, because me and Jackson had you pegged as a paedophile."
"Ain't that right, Jackson?"
"Shit, probably guilty of that too."
"Hey, I don't see what's so fucking funny."
Y'all clowning this motherfucker like it's some big joke.
Well it ain't!
Just go to the concert alone.
- Zach.
- See Seth.
"No bickering, no bantering, just talk."
"As much as I like you, Summer, you need to figure this out with him."
I need you to figure this out.
Holy mack.
"You are, like, such an adult."
"I mean, you're not insecure, you're not jealous."
Are you a robot?
Huh?
"We had a great time over break, right?"
"But if that's all it was supposed to be, and we've taken this as far as possible, just let me know."
Okay?
Okay.
Do you think champagne is really necessary?
Ooh.
Absolutely.
"We need to toast to quitting, slash, getting fired."
To independence.
- You mean unemployment.
"- Oh, Dad, just think how much time Sandy will have to spend on your case."
- Padding around the house in his black socks and his robe.
I can't wait.
"- Cal, don't you have a toast to make, too?"
- No.
"Uh, it's all right."
"Um, too much champagne, I get giggly."
- When have you ever been giggly?
"- Dad, what is it?"
"Julie and I have been talking, and, uh, I've come to a decision."
"Tomorrow morning, I'm calling a press conference to announce that I'll be stepping down from The Newport Group and appointing"
'Morning.
"Rosa, close the door."
There's a draft.
- She opened her eyes.
- That gives me the creeps.
- And when she yawns?
- I shit myself.
"Doctor, I wanted to talk to you."
Of course.
How are you?
How did you sleep?
I'll buy you a coffee.
How long do you think Lydia can stay like this?
"Months, years, her whole life."
Is there no hope?
"As a doctor, I have to say no."
However...
RESUSCITATED
"""Meryl Lazy Moon awakens from a coma after 15 years."""
She went into a coma during childbirth.
"Meryl was a PVS, persistent vegetative state, like Lydia."
theoretically unconscious for life.
Her recovery contradicts all I'm about to say.
So that means there is hope.
"No, I repeat, scientifically, no."
"But if you choose to believe, go ahead."
She can open her eyes.
Or am I imagining that?
"No, she can open her eyes."
But that doesn't mean she can see you or is aware of anything.
Lydia's cerebral cortex has been completely destroyed.
But the brain stem is intact.
Run!
The warehouse is gone.
They can't get out now
Let's retreat!
Run!
Hot?
Hot!
I don't need you to save me
You don't deserve it
Don't pretend you care
Do you think by killing me this world will be a better place?
You're too naive!

There'll always be another villain on the lurk
You will soon be like me

Okay.
Not that I'm obsessed with him.
"Oh, my God!"
"It's a closed-circuit infrared 400,000-CCD-pixel resolution."
I have known Reynaud since I interned under him.
He had an undiagnosed brain tumor.
I want your advice.
"Yes, you have the surgery."
- You remove as much of the...
- What if I don't want to live?
"No, buy as much time as you can, and then you spend it with your son."
"You are wrong,I only know your name, and I am not interested in knowing you."
Alex.
"Where where you, I was looking for you."
Adriana
Its just that I came out for a stroll on this wonderful night.
"to take in the fresh air, and to gaze upon the moon."
A moon in a blue bikini?
"No...you are wrong, Adriana."
"Excuse me, Madame, I forgot my bracelet."
Valet?
"Please give this to Mr. Dinamo, at the casino."
No more bets.

I will teach you how to win at this game.
You don't say. it seems I always loose when you are along.
seventeen.
"Listen to me, I am an expert."
No more bets.
seven red
"Oh my, that is the only time I did not play seven red and now it comes up."
"and its all your fault for interrupting me, just when I was going to play seven red."
"Do not worry, we will win now, on seventeen."
"No more bets, ten black."
"Ah, so you are quite the expert, eh?"
Now you will believe.
Tokens please.
"Unfortunate in games of chance, fortunate in games of love."
Lets put that theory to the test.
"Mr. Dinamo, a message thanks seventeen black"
We won!
"We won, Alex!"
what?
The heavens must be saying that everything will be fine.
Nuna!
Nuna!
(Nuna - older sister)
Who is it?
"My sister is acting very strangely, she can't breathe."
How can that be?
"Put her on oxygen, and inject her with epinephrine."
Yes.
Does she have asthma?
"I'm not sure, but she is allergic to flour."
She ate food containing flour today.
It's possible that her allergy caused anaphylactic shock.
"Her blood pressure is 70/40, and her pulse is only 41."
Her oxygen saturation is only at 70%.
"Nuna, Nuna, Mi Jin Noona..."
(Nuna - older sister)
"Then we'll leave it to you, Doctor."
"Let's not be too worried, let's go out and wait."
"Oh, why is there such a thing!"
"Kim Na Na, can't I go first?"
What did I do?
I don't know them.
Do you think I'd ask you to bring me here if my leg didn't hurt?
Ah... seriously.
Mi Jin!
What if your father comes back late?
You should clean the house.
Make some food to eat with your brother.
"You clearly knew that flour would cause problems, so why did you still eat bread?"
"Eonni, you don't know what happened."
Our water and gas were cut off.
-She's just a kid.
Jesus Christ.
"-The fuck, Emerson?"
(panting)
GREY:
No loose ends.
(COCKS GUN)
(GUNSHOT)
DOCTOR:
How long have you been out in the field?
"It should say there, in the file."
I want to hear what you say.
A long time.
I didn't know you smoked.
When did you start?
Right after I quit drinking.
Why did you stop drinking?
I was a drunk.
What would you say is your current disposition?
How do I feel?
How do you feel about the girl?
She asked a very good question.
-Which was?
-Why?
"Well, that's a question that needs to be asked."
We are not sociopaths.
We're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else.
"We face these decisions every day, and we vote up or down."
"Like everything else, it has all been distilled down to zeros and ones."
They have asked for me to describe your emotional state
(helicopter hovering) in as detailed a manner as possible.
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field.
He was found two weeks ago.
Patrolman saw him wandering on Bahnhofstrasse.
"Dazed, confused."
"Ran his prints and uh, found that he worked for your group, NATO Intelligence."
Thought you could help us.
He was stationed in Zurich.
Shuffling papers.
Hm.
What'd the doctor's say?
No.
He's catatonic.
"Appears to be awake but he's uh, not responsive."
There's been no change in the two weeks.
I think he's hopeless.
So whatever he once knew will die with him.
Nothing?
"No sir, we had a tracer put on Keene's passport."
The woman as well.
But they vanished.
And Jared Clayton.
"They are moving him into a nursing home, outside of Staad."
On NIA pension of course.
Of course.
"All right, we tie up the usual loose ends."
Release statements about terrorist cells to cover up.
"And tomorrow morning, we'll be back to business as usual."
"Good night, agent Henry."
"Sir, there's just one more thing."
It's very late.
It's about the Kozlenko affair.
What about it?
"I did some research, and as you know the NIA keeps excellent records."
- It makes a handy weapon in a pinch.
You kidnapped me with a candy bar?
"Well, you have to admit it was rather inventive."
"Oh, God."
Don't be upset.
"If I'd had a real gun, I would have used it."
It sure felt like a gun.
I thought for sure everybody would hear the wrapper crinkle.
"Oh, God."
I can just see the headline now.
- Hey.
"Hey, candy thief."
"- ""Kidnapper Exposed When Candy Gun Melts In Hand. """
Hey!
Hey!
Come on.
Thanks.
Thank you.
If my father only knew you kidnapped me with a candy bar.
Think of the embarrassment.
"Oh, God, what a jerk."
"You know, he's probably thinking right now about how he can use all this publicity... 'cause he wants to run for governor of California."
"Now listen, once this whole fiasco is over..."
I want you to get me and Natalie on A.M. San Diego... and all the national morning shows.
Call Ted Turner.
Tell him I'll give him an exclusive first once this insane thing is wrapped up... in exchange for some good publicity.
He owes me one.
"Uh, you get to work."
I'll call you back.
- Mr. Voss?
- What is it?
- Our chopper's back.
- This was awkward.
"Like, ""Wait a minute, no way."
Seth Meyers?
"- That wasn't him."""
- Their mouths were making noises.
"- I'm like, ""Why are you telling me?"""
"- They totally made out, like, for real."
"This was an interesting biological experiment, to have them making out in the back of that Yugo for a whole night."
- I think that's fake.
"- Yeah, they committed."
- Something came over them.
- Did they get pregnant that night?
Their characters did.
The characters got pregnant.
"Their characters did, they did."
Sick.
Was it awk...?
Did they...?
"Like, when you guys would cut in between would, then, they sit on opposite sides?"
"- No, we were all talking."
- They were chilling.
- Or were they still making out?
- They were friends before this.
"So it was more comfortable than it would've been, I think."
I don't think they were friends in italics.
They weren't friends afterwards.
No.
Bet she was pointy.
"It was fun, though."
I remember laughing a lot this night.
And we went really late this night.
"I think we went till, like, 6 or 7."
"You killed leslie stoltz,"
And we can tie you to both.
You guys are pretty funny.
"I mean, you just crack me up."
You really think you're gonna pin a murder rap on me...
Based on a lambskin condom?
I don't think anybody here
"Mentioned a lambskin condom, genius."
That's knowledge only the killer would have.
Ah.
"You know, mr."
Enright told me
That she'd be a willing participant.
He told me that he was sick of the bitch.
"He gave her to me, as a bonus,"
Because we had a good year.
"You know, if she would've just relaxed and just..."
"Stayed with the program,"
Everything would've been just fine.
So that's when leslie tried to stop you.
She came barging in.
"And everything kind of went, uh..."
Everything kind of went haywire.
"Oh, my god."
What are you doing to her?
You shouldn't be here.
So you roofied anna
Because she wouldn't cooperate.
"I didn't roofie anybody, pint-size."
That was tony.
Do you want her?
You can have her.
She pays his salary.
"She may let him strut around like boss man, but make no mistake... without his wife, David Harris is a big, fat zero."
Sorry.

"Nice to see you, ladies."
"L""ll give you a call."
"Clara, God""s grace is with you."
- Kiss the children for me.
- I will.
"Son, don""t you worry."
The Lord forgives everybody eventually.
Thank you for saying that.
I made dinner reservations for tonight.
Just the two of us.
Same place we got married.
Where?
"David, at the Bayview."
I like this music.
"You""ve really impressed me, David... the way you""ve handled this like a man."
"Pastor Paul says, as long as you""re completely honest... we can survive this."
For a second I thought it might have been-- lt was like going out the jump door.
I was falling through space.
"Count, sucker, and pull the ring."
One thousand.
Two thousand.
"Then, lights."
The ground batteries had picked me up.
"I tried to side-slip the chute, but I couldn't."
"The lights got brighter, blinding me."
He's coming to.
"Go ahead and make with the music, f riend."
We love it.
"What's the letter say, f riend?"
"- Tell us about it, f riend."
"- Quiet, Krause."
I haven't yet solved the code.
Repeat the message in the letter.
I hadn't read it yet.
I just started to when you sapped me.
You place me in an extremely distastef ul position.
"By nature, I'm a gentleman."
Truly gentle.
Brutality has always revolted me as a weapon of the witless.
Like your f riend Baretto.
"Yes, and Krause here."
Although Krause's inclinations are more psychopathic than intelligent.
"He suffered an injury to his brain once, and ever since then.... lf you make me leave you to his quiet whims, I will never f orgive you."
Go take a flying jump f or yourself.
I'd f ormed a higher opinion of your ability to make decisions.
"The rest is to dance time, f riend."
"You like music, f riend?"
I like music.
"""And I'm also going to take a picture."""
And so I took this picture.
"And it was really hot, I tried to show this with..."
With this clumsy coloration.
Clumsy...
A picture can be personally pornographic while being also...
Publically decent.
Wouldn't you say so?
This is my father.
Where is this?
"Between Washington and New York, on the road."
This was one and a half years ago.
I took it because I realized it was...
The way I saw my father...
"Almost all of my childhood, as we travelled..."
"While driving, I always saw him from the back."
I saw his eyes only through the mirror.
I mostly saw his big hands on the wheel.
I trusted him.
Therefore it's a picture...
I mean...
"It's a family picture, a sentimental picture."
A childhood memory.
But it's a childhood memory that isn't in childhood pictures...
That's why I reproduced it.
I mean re-photographing a memory I had.
This isn't a family picture.
It's in Corsica.
It's a pseudo-sunset.
The sunset isn't real.
"The sun wasn't setting, it's here."
The light beams.
"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked."
I've seen your picture in the paper from time to time.
They don't do you enough justice.
But I'm sure you've heard that more than once.
"Thank you, doctor."
And thank you for coming to the house.
"Oh, it's a pleasure, ma'am."
"I'd like you to meet my niece, Samantha Reece."
How do you do?
Pleasure.
Likewise.
Doctor?
"Oh, forgive me."
I was just studying that oil.
It's magnificent.
I think everything about this house is going to be magnificent.
Bad news?
What kind of bad news?
About my record company.
"Someone is buying up large blocks of stock in my company, and I don't like it."
When did all this begin?
Immediately after your party.
When you announced the pipeline deal.
The brokerage house that is handling the deal is located-
Don't tell me.
It's located in California.
"Los Angeles, to be exact."
Were you able to trace down who it was that was buying up that stock?
No.
No.
I haven't been able to find out anything.
It's Jason Colby.
What I saw was the night-show;
He's into the matinees now!
Let's apply some ointment...
Why did you go there anyway?
I went for a soft-drink and she didn't let me open the fridge.
The thief?
She must have had it herself.
She's stolen so much already.
Is that the truth?
Of course.
All right.
Papa will set it right!
"Aunt will set it right, you mean!"
Well...
Aunt will!
"Back to the table, Bharti."
"I've got an order for 50000 pairs of shoes from Italy, sir."
The manager has left his file.
Good.
But he said we can't execute the order.
Why not?
Slaying animals is tough... thanks to the animal protection groups.
They're protesting atrocities against animals in the Capital.
"You'll get a shock, Bharti."
Kaushalya... you switch it on.
"""Listen to the secret news from Bharti"""
"""There are many thefts taking place at No. 10, Juhu Scheme"""
"""Our reporter, Aunty, is investigating the robberies"""
"""We present a special report"""
You even steal!
That's not me!
"They're playing such dirty tricks on film stars, too!"
- I'll drive you home.
"- No, I'll get there myself."
"Okay, Mike."
- Tell me I'm a genius.
- You're a genius.
Come on.
You can do better than that.
Remember the mail we were sorting' through at Doug's place?
"Outdoor Life, Field  Stream."
Got me thinkin'.
Outdoor types always go back to the woods.
"I got ahold of a buddy at the Coast Guard who knows a guy in Park Service... and I said, ""Hey, there's a couple of good bottles of Patrón in it for you if""-"
"- Just tell me, Sam."
- State Parks has a record... of Doug's license plate at Mangrove Campground.
- Keys.
- Yeah.
"Now, look."
"I'd go there with you, but..."
Veronica sort of set up a mini vacation in Boca.
"- You know, one of those swimming' with the dolphins-"
- I'll take care of it.
I can't believe that you found them so quickly.
That's amazing.
My friend Sam may have bruised a couple federal statutes along the way... but nothin' a gift-wrapped bottle of tequila can't smooth over.
"- Well, you won't get in trouble?"
- We found him.
That's what's important.
I knew I could count on you.
- Is that loaded?
- Yeah.
"Well, you're not gonna bring that with you when you go getJasper, right?"
It'll be fine.
Well you broadcast this alone.
Did you go crazy for her or what?
No.
I only wanted...
Sorry.
-Well not this at all.
-And why not?
"On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other, and they call it love."
Why don't you want to broadcast it?
Because they wouldn't understand it.
Love...
And why do you care?
We must deliver all available information.
"This information is available, but incommunicable."
-What do you suggest?
-I wouldn't like it if we caused panic on our planet.
I'll alter it a bit.
-What about this?
-Let me see.
"""On Earth there are people of different genders, that attract each other."" This is already better."
So broadcast it.
"But... ""attract each other""."
I'll omit this too.
-This is useless titillation.
-All right.
Broadcast it.
-And what about the gender?
-What about it?
"Wait, I have it!"
And this way it will be without consequences.
"""There are people on Earth."""
Right?
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.
Why don't they just come right out and tell us what's on their minds?
You're more advanced than a cockroach.
Have you ever tried explaining yourself to one of them?
How many people have seen it?
Ten.
"Twenty, maybe."
Listen to me.
Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.
Don't go back.
Stay away.
I can't talk about this anymore.
Mr. Leek.
There is a reason... that I ended up in Point Pleasant.
Something brought me there.
Whatever brought you there... brought you there to die.
You're just in time.
They're just about to light this Christmas tree.
They have been for the last two hours.
Isn't that Denise?
Is she okay?
She left Gordon.
He got fired from the chemical plant.
Just stopped coming to work one day.
Where is he?
Who knows?
Be back in a second.
Connie.
What's wrong?
Fifteen more people reported seeing that thing today.
I have a family that needs me!
"When's the last time you did something, anything, without thinking about how your family might react?"
- I think Griff is in trouble.
"- I told you, he's using!"
Tell me you think our brother is not on drugs.

"Jesus, she's a cop."
What the hell happened?
Fell through the floor at an abandoned factory chasing some jackass.
- How's her airway?
"- Looks clear, but her sats are low, 93 percent."
I'm taking her up to 10 litres of O2...
let's push ***.
She's tachypneic but breaths are shallow.
Where are those chest tubes?
- Laryngoscope?
"- Kelly clamp, now."
Got no radial femoral pulse by palpation.
- It's already at the carotid.
- That's not a good sign.
- How is she?
- Right tube... is placed.
- You need to find her husband.
"- I'll call dispatch, let them know."
That doesn't mean he's God... or even smarter than we are.
But from where he's sitting... he can see a little further down the road.
I think we can assume that... these entities are more advanced than us.

Something terrible is going to happen in Point Pleasant.

It was business.

Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.

"He was one of the city's biggest hijackers of booze, cigarettes, razor blades, shrimp and lobsters."
Shrimp and lobsters were best.

This is the problem.

But that's not possible.
That's what we thought.
So we tried again.
And again.
And again.
And the same six numbers kept popping up.
"Not always in the same order, but the very same numbers."
How did that happen?
They're very lucky numbers?
Metallic paint.
"Very good, Mr. Monk."
We took a closer look.
The numbers on these six balls and only these six balls were painted with metal-based paint.
All the others were acrylic based.

Then she really was all talk.
Rider died protecting her Master.
You are in no position to call her a coward.
A coward is a coward.

Uh... with my credit card.
- OK...
"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Would it be more suspicious if I use cash to pay for the fertilizer?
- No.
"- Um, I disagree."
I think cash would be much more suspicious.
"And yes, to answer the question your face is asking,"
I am a Muslim.
OK...
Does that mean you get like a discount or something?
I should get a discount!
Inform the chiefs of all the 12 clans
Tomorrow morning... we're going to gather in Wushe
and offer a blood sacrifice
Our ancestors' spirits...
We're here for the guns.
Sorry to disturb you
- Boss...
- Welcome.
This way please
Fill them up with salt And give me ten boxes of matches
Wow!
"Lots of things to buy, huh?"
"Boss, we'll pay for it next time"
On credit again?
"- Yes, we can"
- How much is it?
"No, you can't!"
Wait!
You're buying all these on credit?
It's alright
It's alright?
But you never pay me back!
Let's give them a hand
That old drunkard Mouna Rudo really can't take it anymore?
I'll ask the young men to get ready before they all get dead drunk
"Young man, how dare you tell me these in front of the police station!"
Good morning!
Pihu Sapu?
What the hell was he up to?
That crazy boy spells nothing but trouble
"But we'd be bored around here without him, won't we?"
You call making troubles interesting?
This thing looks okay.
Very okay.
But there is a conviction.
Criminal possession in the fourth degree.
In the fourth degree.
A 4-C.
It's a probational offense.
Practically a misdemeanor.
"Kevin, there are 4-Cs, and there are 4-Cs."
You keep looking at that as if it weren't kosher.
A cut of meat is kosher.
A piece of fish.
Savory foods are kosher.
But a probation report is not kosher.
A probation report is merely a probation report.
"I am a good Louisiana lapsed Catholic, Abe."
Don't talk to me about kosher.
Give it to me straight.
What's wrong with this?
It's too kosher.
Translate that for me.
The Virgin looks pregnant to me.
Look.
The supervisor signed this.
So what?
That's a lot of weight for a 4-C.
So what happened to the original little probation officer?
Where is his signature?
Do you know this supervisor?
His name is Schwartz.
- A landsman of yours?
- Landsman landsman.
"Then why, Luis, are you alive and Julio's dead ?"
"I'm cagey, man."
Not cagey.
Meaningless.
Got the bullet from Julio ?
Right here.
22-caliber.
Long rifle used for distance.
And not a match to Luis's gun.
"What else, Alexx ?"
"Julio's got ulcerations of the oral mucosa, stomach and intestines."
That's rare for a young man.
Yeah.
And look at this :
He's got burns and lesions on both hands.
"Now the burns could've come from drug use, but the lesions, I don't think so."
"Alexx, I want to order a CBC."
A complete blood count ?
I don't think this is drug-related.
You think he was killed for some other reason ?
Not killed.
Assassinated.
"Horatio, I've got the results of the blood work you asked for."
Ran Julio's CBC with a complete white cell differential.
And look at this :
his lymphocytes are alarmingly low.
"And you couple that with the ulceration, and, well..."
He's been exposed to radiation.
And not a little.
We're talking serious exposure.
This guy was working in this stuff.
"Thank you, Alexx."
Tell me you're sending this.
She's relaying a message.
"It says ""century""."
Starbuck's been hit.
I say again :
Starbuck's going down.
"There's really not much more on the eye in these scriptures, but there is... several interesing stories about the temple."
Listen to this.
"""Five pillars of the temple were fashioned after the five priests"
"- devoted to the one whose name..."""
- Laura.
What ?
The cylon we know as Boomer arrived with the others.
"She told our Sharon that her child was alive, and that she was on board one of the cylon baseships."
And that she had been seen on New Caprica in your school.
The child is alive.
Yes.
Yes.
The child was at the school.
"Yes, I kept her there."
And we suspected that the cylons captured her during the exodus from New Caprica.
"Yes, it's true."
"Listen, the thing you might want to know is that when she..."
Do you have any idea what we've gone through ?
You of all people... know what it's like to lose a child.
The difference is your child's still alive.
"And eventually, I hope you become grateful of that."
I want to see her.
"What you mean, she's gone down."
Gone down where ?
Somewhere in the north valley.
"Okay, get your men on the line."
And you are never gonna believe where she works.
"(whirring, rhythmic beeping)"
(tires screech)
"Yes, I can confirm that one Amanda Baylor is in the hiz-ouse."
"Very unattractive, in case you're wondering."
"By the way, are you aware of a little film called The Graduate?"
Mike Nichols.
Fantastic.
"""Would you like me to seduce you?"""
"Wait, what?"
Were you quoting the movie or was that real?
Where's Baylor?
Secure encryption room.
She's in the middle of a 72-hour shift.
"Logged in 14.5 hours ago, before I got here."
"Once an encryptor goes in, they don't come out-- department policy."
Probably well on the way to being ripe in there.
Did you know that your hair sparkles under these fluorescents?
Really?
How much does it sparkle?
So much.
So much?
"So, so much."
Open it.
Can't.
"No in, no out."
Encryptors even have their own private commode.
There's a lot of confidential crap in there.
Here.
"I can make sure you don't lose your job, but there might be something else we could talk about you losing."
I've decided to open it.
Thank you.
"Right, I'd like to get started right away."
Of course.
"Sara, would you get the neutrotope, please?"
Sorry.
It's a natural reaction.
"Right, I'll get back to you as soon as I can."
You're quite sure about volunteering to stay?
We must help these people.
Must we?
"Personally, I don't care if their whole planet turns into a mushroom."
I shall stay because I don't like an unsolved mystery.
You don't think Dortmunn and his life rocket are the answer?
- No.
- Why not?
There is something else that has to happen before it all begins to come together.
Thank you.
You'd better give me your guns.
- Don't fail us.
- I won't.
"Vila, bring me up."
"My people have a saying, ""A man who trusts can never be betrayed, only mistaken""."
Life expectancy must be fairly short among your people.
- 3210?
- Check.
32100?
- Where are Cally and Avon?
- It's a long story.
- What's in the box?
- It's an even longer story
I like stories!
"Zen, get a locator fix on the other ship."
I want to be able to pinpoint its position at all times.
- Is this a trick?
"- Nope, just, you know, wanted to do something nice for someone other than myself for a change."
"So hopefully, I don't know, we can all hang out, we can be friends."
Friends.
If you want.
"Anyways, enjoy the show."
"- Do you want this closed, or...?"
- Yeah.
"Thanks for letting me stay over, and thanks for breakfast."
"You finally learned how to make French toast, huh?"
"Mm, anytime."
Happy to have the company.
- I know what you mean.
"- Yeah, what do you know about being lonely?"
Hmm.
"Well, let's see."
My stepfather blackmailed me into living with my mom.
"My mom shipped my little sister off to boarding school, oh, and my boyfriend spent the entire summer with a girl, who may or may not have been pregnant with his child,"
- and now that he is back he won't talk to me thanks to D.J.
- Who's D.J.?
"Doesn't even matter since he's not talking to me, either."
"Mariss, honey?"
You ready to go?
I'm gonna go get my stuff.
Back to the gulag.
She knows I heard that.
It's a little game we play.
Mm-hmm.
So how's Caleb?
"Fantastic, never better."
"- Facing prison, we could lose everything."
- So you gonna divorce him and take his kids?
"Yes, sir."
I have a good idea of where he is.
But we don't want lntelligence in this.
"I regret to say, sir, yes."
"That's right, sir. I ref use."
The last address Yale had for Preston was a town I'd never heard of.
"Welcome to Gulf City, Mr. Murdock."
Murdock....
"Yes, a room is reserved f or you."
Nobody knew I was coming.
"- Warren Murdock, and f rom St. Louis."
"- l don't get it, but I'll take it."
It's our best.
The gentleman who telephoned insisted.
"- Then it's f or me, all right."
"- Front, boy."
"Geronimo, the paratroopers' jump call."
"It was Johnny, all right."
We could read each other's minds.
He knew I'd want to help.
He'd seen me look at the back of his pin.
"Will call later, the message said."
That was 10 hours ago.
"How long is ""later""?"
"What to do in a hot wind, smelling of jasmine ex cept wait and sweat and prime the body to sweat more?"
A phone directory might help.
I'd never heard of Johnny speak of any relatives but I was ready to try anything.
"""Prendergast, Prescott, Prestwood. """
"Stalled again, like a jeep on synthetic gas."
48 hours since he'd called and no word.
I'd pitched the Cardinals into the pennant and set the Red Sox down in the World Series.
"Suddenly, Johnny's service record came to me like a photograph."
"What I mean is if he could stay in the sick bay he'd be out of their hands, you see."
- Who would be out of whose hands?
- Your son.
- What are you trying to tell me?
- I can hear everything.
My quarters are just opposite.
These punishments...
Is my...
Is Mr. Crawford the only one punished?
"No, but when two or three get beaten, he's always one of them."
It's got to stop.
"On the lower deck, men are beginning to think..."
- Think what?
- What I mean is...
"Mr. Scott-Padget's compliments, sir."
"He begs you for an audience, sir."
"At once, if possible."
"He said it is of the most vital importance, sir."
"- Mr. Crawford, go to sick bay."
"- No, sir, I'm not ill."
Honestly.
"Please, may I take him your answer, sir?"
I'll deliver it myself.
- You asked to see me.
- I didn't expect you to come.
I want to thrash you and clap you in irons but that would suit you very well.
"- I fail to understand, sir."
- Do you?
I won't follow your previous captains onto the beach.
Understood?
"- Now, what do you want?"
- Only to be restored to duty.
- It was his hat.
- What are you doing with his hat?
Why shouldn't I have his hat?
"Hanna, maybe you're looking for something a little edgier after Sean."
- But this guy is dark.
"- Spencer, he's not that dark."
He's dark enough.
"Well, he's no Arthur Dodger, whoever that is."
"Yeah, he's just had it tough."
Are you two on speaking terms again?
- Of course we are.
- You need to be careful about that guy.
It seems to me we had this conversation once about Toby.
I'm looking for Coach Fulton.
- Is the coach expecting you?
- The coach is avoiding me.
- That's what the coach is doing.
- Are you a parent?
"Yes, I'm a parent."
Nick McCullers.
My daughter is Paige McCullers.
I have your daughter in English Comp.
I'm Ezra Fitz.
The coach.
Why don't we walk to the principal's office see if we can find Coach Fulton?
I've seen the principal and all I got was politically correct double-talk.
About the agenda in this place that's penalizing my daughter.
Taking opportunities and giving them to someone who doesn't deserve them!
"Everybody gets a fair chance here, Mr. McCullers."
We go out of our way to make sure it works.
My girl is the best swimmer on that team.
You can't give it to somebody...
I didn't get your name.
Shawna.
Hi.
- And you are...?
- Therapist.
From Cardiology.
Really?
Your husband has to undergo an angioplasty.
"That's where we're going to insert a catheter into a blood vessel in his leg, and we're gonna use it to inflate a balloon that will open the blockage."
"Well, good luck, Mr. Rappaport."
I have to get back to my other patients.
It was nice to meet you.
Excuse me for just one second.
Whoa.
That was close.
Thanks.
I-I really owe you one.
"Hey, listen, if you ever need a sex therapist..."
I think I'm good.
"Now that you mention it, do you ever do any pro bono work?"
"Yes, I spoke to your resident, and he thought a hold was unnecessary, but I disagree, and all I'm asking is for a second assessment from another attending."
Watch it!
"No, Dr. Wakita, not you."
"Hey, Jerry, where have you been?"
I was getting worried about you.
Everyone was acting as if I'd sent you out in a hurricane.
Are you okay?
What the hell happened to King Funshine?
Did you get hit by lightning again?
He didn't get hit by lightning.
Here's your change.
Okay.
Don't rush.
Do I want to know what you had to promise him
To get him to come?
"No, it wasn't me."
"It's not like he even listens to me,"
And he probably just ran out of girls to have sex with.
"I, uh, want to apologize."
My absence has been inexcusable.
"Well, I know my situation brings up a lot of issues for you."
You've had to deal with so much loss.
But I'm not gonna lose you.
"I'm here for you,"
Every step of the way.
"You, uh, you look good, Lily."
"In fact, you look better than good."
You look great.
Thank you.
I feel great.
So you had better be prepared
"For a lifetime of family brunches,"
Because I'm not going anywhere.
Okay.
Oh.
Hey.
I bailed on the Columbia gala.
I was kind of in the mood
For watching a pretentious movie I don't understand
With you and Vanessa.
"No Vanessa, but pretentious movie?"
check.
"Look, not that I'm not thrilled to expose you"
"To the joys of Russian cinema, but does this visit of yours"
There must be some way to stop him.
Things are out of control now.
I'm running out of options.
Wait.
Mace...
You can't be serious.
"- I mean, what would the Illuminati say?"
- If I wasted the gargoyle?
"Lt'll be a black mark, no question of that."
I'll be severely reprimanded.
"But if I allow Goliath to become the first prisoner who ever escaped Hotel Cabal, the flushing sound you hear will be me and my 75-year pension going down the drain."
Notice the one-way mirror.
(thud)
- I can't miss.
"It's checkout time, gargoyle."
"- I don't think so, Mace."
Bluestone!
Whoa.
- Going up?
"- As a matter of fact, I am."
Hold on!
"You played me for a fool, Bluestone!"
You and the gargoyle were in this together!
"What can I say, Mace?"
"(laughs) When you're right, you're right."
"I'll see that you get yours, Bluestone."
Nobody double-crosses Mace Malone!
Nobody!
Poor Mace.
Wonder how long it'll take him to realize he dropped his key.
"(Matt) OK, I admit it."
"To save Goliath's life I had to forfeit my chance to get in good with the Illuminati, bust their organization wide open."
"David, my wife Sally."
"David, hi."
Pleasure.
Pleased to meet you.
Shall we get you home?
(Door opens)
Just passing.
Mm-hm.
Am I correct in remembering you handled a drug case two years ago with a key witness who's a guy called Shrimpton?
Stanley Shrimpton?
You got a conviction on the basis of his testimony.
That's what you've come here to talk about?
"Yeah, I think I might be defending a genuinely innocent guy."
"I mean, an actually innocent guy."
Why did you go to bed with me if you didn't want me?
Hmm?
Was it just about landing me?
"Once I'm flapping about on the deck, I'm just a dead fish."
"What are you talking about landing you, Red?"
We'd already done it before.
"So you tell me, then."
Why did you want me?
"Because at that precise moment, there was no-one more beautiful on Earth and I had to have you."
"No, no, no, you're so full of shit!"
OK.
"Because I was drowning, and because you were a lifebuoy and you were in the same wet place."
Stanley Shrimpton.
A piece of vermin who got off child abuse charges by becoming a police informant.
"Now, go, will you?"
"Thanks, Red."
"OK, I'm sorry."
I was bored stupid.
- Does Vicki know about this?
- No.
And I don't want her to know.
I've been targeted and that puts everyone who's close to me in danger.
"Oh, gee..."
Thanks for bringing me into this.
"Okay, if only one of you can work this town, how do I know I'm not going to like this other vampire more than you?"
"Because I'm the devil you know, detective."
"Yes, you are."
Okay.
Two conditions.
"One, we find this thing, we put it down."
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What's the second?
- Full disclosure.
"I ask you something, you answer."
"I want to know what color your underwear is, you tell me."
You got it?
Red.
"Silk, actually."
"I'm not actually asking, Fitzroy."
When do we start?
As soon as somebody phones the police about a dead body.
Got a quarter?
I feel so bad for that Evan guy.
He blames himself for Gene's death.
Does he have reason to?
Typical Friday night.
Go train in from the burbs.
Burger and a movie after the Underground.
They must have up to something.
"Come on, you don't go out for a burger and wind up as the main course at an insect buffet."
What happened to the Poncherello School of Cool?
"Well, I'm always open for suggestions, Jon."
"Go up to her and say, ""Hey, my name is Frank and I'd like to get to know you. "" Take it from there, just be honest."
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
I'm gonna let her discover me.
I'll put these on and go outside and polish my bike.
"Chicks can't resist a nice, shiny bike."
And me in these shorts.
There she is.
I can't see her feet.
Got it.
Dalecki's Baby Food.
One of my officers?
Loose load cite?
"Not so far, but we'll check right into it."
"Yes, sir, we'll start an immediate search for the two boxes."
Right.
15-5 Mary L.A.
"11-82, southbound Harbor freeway at Exposition."
"15-7, Mary L.A."
"11-79, northbound Hollywood Freeway at Vermont."
Attention all units we are requesting all area agencies to assist in the search for two boxes of contaminated baby food.
"The boxes were lost on the Golden State, southbound, near Ninth."
The food is contaminated with botulism.
"Repeat, botulism."
I can't find the blue one.
Which goes best with these shorts?
Come on.
You're not going to a fashion show.
- You're going to meet a girl.
"- Yeah, maybe I don't need a shirt."
Is she dangerous?
She's a Wraith!
"Although, I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Now remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferrison root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock now, would we?"
No father.
Seriously.
Have you ever seen anything like this before?
No I have not.
She's unlike any Wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer, why would he protect her?"
Maybe the act is for his benefit too.
"No, they live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other Wraith, he would be her first victim."
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
I just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's gonna take him up to the cave.
I'm gonna check in with the villagers.
What are you gonna tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Let's start by analysing that drug of yours, shall we?"
"Yes, of course."
- Unless maybe that's what you want... - Cohen!
- What?
Come on!
Just wait a second.
- I believed you.
"How you were changing, that you just wanted to be friends."
- I do!
That's...
Maybe I just...
I can't be just friends with you.
"Well, then, I guess maybe this is it for us."
I'm so tired right now.
I
- I didn't even sleep at all.
"- Oh, dude, the only thing holding my head up is my lungs. - Sorry, man."
- I handled that Summer situation so wrong...
I just...
- I really shouldn't have returned her phone calls.
- She never called you.
- I should've dated other girls.
- What other girls?
"Maybe if I'd played her hot and cold, right, mess with her mind a little bit, then I don't know."
I think it potentially could
"- Look, man, I'm sorry, really, I am, and I would love to rehash the evening second by second one more time, but I'm late."
-
- Uh...
I'm meeting my lab partner.
I've got this physics assignment.
- On a Saturday?
"- Ryan, the whole geek routine... it was really amusing at first, but I think you're taking things a little bit too far."
- Thi
"- I just need to talk about me for, like, several more hours at least."
- Jesus!
Are you sure?
Take her by car did not help.
I'll take care of it.
How will you deal?
"We will aim, Carl, until we learn."
- What can we find out?
- If you are scared.
- It's already scared.
- Can not scared enough.
"Thanks, Kate."
"Miss Keesey,"
I'm Special Agent Adam Frawley.
I deal with the bank robbery investigation.
Need to tell you we take fingerprints to eliminate them from the list of suspects.
I see that you have given us a preliminary DECLARATION.
I want to talk about your abduction.
Well.
I understood that you were threatened.
One of them stole my license management.
You tried to escape?
No.
We can identify in any way?
Do you have evidence to stand as witness?
I tried to escape because they were înarmaþi.
I understand.
Then they let you go?
"Yes, I have let you go."
You should not have a lawyer here?
"You're not charged, but anyone asks a lawyer is guilty."
- I believe that you did not need.
- Okay.
While behind the wheel of a car with headlights on.
So?
"- Marisa, how long have you smoked?"
None of your business.
- Just humor me.
"I don't know, since, like, 10th grade."
When I was 15.
- You've always smoked Camels?
"Pretty much, except for when I've bummed from friends."
You've seen that pack of Camels thousands of times.
Think real hard about the man on the package.
Was he sitting on the camel or is he leading him with a rope?
"Oh, come on, Marisa, this is a fastball right down the middle."
This is ridiculous.
"- Ah-ah-ah, no cheating."
Come on.
"Okay, fine."
I am 99 percent sure that the man is leading the camel by a rope.
Shit.
There is no man.
"Wow, that's crazy."
What people see and what they think they see are often two different things.
How can we put so much weight on what a witness saw in a flash in the middle of the night?
"Trick question or whatever, the fact is you don't admit to murder if you didn't do it."
They wore him down until he believed what they told him to believe.
- I want another vote.
Judd?
Okay.
All those favoring guilty?
"Hey, Jean."
Yeah?
- Did you clear out my messages?
Why didn't you just telephone the restaurant?
The line was engaged.
"There isn't really a fire at St Mary's, is there?"
) George is Max.
"Well, I think I had better get back, just, just in case..."
Good idea.
"I hope we can do this again, Bridget?"
"Oh, yes!"
Of course!
I'd like to eat this fish but I don't think it would be safe.
I know you killed Vera Blanchett... ..and let an innocent boy swing for it.
"I don't know what you're talking about, Father."
Your work took you to the Crown Court regularly.
That's where you met Vera.
"She was young, impressionable."
You were a Detective Sergeant.
How could she refuse you?
But she did.
"And that's when it went horribly, horribly wrong."
I presume Max is your middle name?
If you leave this restaurant I will call the police.
Was it your idea to pin Vera's murder onto Thomas?
"It was my boss's idea, and his boss's."
"To protect their reputation and the ""good name"" of the police?"
But I did nothing to stop them!
Did you poison Henry too?
What?
No!
Surely he needed to be silenced.
Thanks to Iris he knew that you were Vera's killer.
But I only just found that out from Mrs McCarthy.
"Father, I have done some monstrous things in my time but believe me, I would never, ever harm Henry or Mrs McCarthy."
And you need to trust me.
You give me orders.
I'll follow them.
But you inherited me.
You didn't...
see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal -- they were fake."
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those... kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
"- mom, i told uncle bob -- - i don't care."
please don't leave me alone here with her.
"- these bullies are hassling tim again, and just because someone had him kick them in the nuts."
"- well, that's not my fault!"
it's his dingdong haircut and his silly eyeglasses that make him get in trouble!
- mom!
"- oh, you know what i mean."
come on.
"i'm your mother, and you're staying right here."
damn kids!
- dang kids.
- da-- dang kids.
"[chuckles] yeah, they're always listening to their friends and not their parent."
"- it, um, appears the only items you have in your refrigerator are two cans of cheese-please and a liter of pop?"
"- yeah, it's -- it's grocery day."
- it's grocery day!
it's grocery day.
"look, i know these kids."
"they -- they eat a full balanced diet 'cause they're still growing and crap, so..."
- oh.
so you do have a job?
- no!
working's for suckers!
- [chuckles] - skoal!
"- i'm, actually -- um, i'm, like, in this transitional phase right now."
- i've seen enough.
"[door creaks] uh, who is she?"
i-i don't have her on my list.
- oh.
"um, she ain't really mine."
"see, her daddy is my friend with benefits."
so she just comes around here sometimes.
Those two.
"All right, ma'am, I've just spoken to Amy."
Her and Dan are with Pierce and his mom at the hospital.
- But there's been a holdup.
"- Oh, God."
She's probably gonna die just to spite me.
That evil bitch.
And Richard and Jonah are there.
And I blame Kent and Bill for that.
"Well, this is a long glass of frozen strawberry fuckup."
"Hey, listen, Ben, you've got to do something."
I don't want to be a bagman for the toughest guy in D block.
"- All right, stop it, Gary."
"- Okay, look, get Pierce here."
Okay?
Right now.
"I'm gonna take control of this situation that I don't know anything about, right?"
Because I am the only one who seems to be...
Capable.
"Oh, God."
Is it possible to stop coughing?
No!
- You are not taking him.
- His jittery ass is mine.
"- Guys, I'm right here."
"- I'm sorry, your jittery ass is the president's."
"You shouldn't even be here, Jonah, unless you're giving your brain to science."
"I'm here on behalf of the president, Amy."
Do you remember her?
She's the woman that would have fired you if you hadn't gone fucking Fukushima.
"That's right, we're on a mission."
I am surprised the two of you even found your way out of your own mothers' vaginas.
"They called me Minx, sent me to New York, and I sent money home to mother and she stopped crying."
That's when I learned that the best medicine is money.
Money.
I still dream of being a psychiatrist.
Because I think I could help people with their problems.
Really I do.
Do you?
"I've been developing my ideas, Michelangelo."
And I'm here to make a proposal to you.
I've seen your site.
"Yes, I have."
"I know my way around the web, all right."
"Now if you put your mind to it, you could become one of our brand-awareness operators, Michelangelo."
You could become... an influencer.
Do you know what that is?
That is a kid who sets a trend.
And we employ a lot of them.
"Now tell me, OK, honestly."
How many hits did your site have yesterday?
Wow!
Really?
"You see, I knew that the youth market was the niche to explore."
It is just where the numbers are...
"Except for the ageing population, of course."
Wow!
That just came to me.
Geriatrics!
"They sure need fragrance, right?"
"See, Michelangelo, you have to think ahead in the world of the new."
That's a pity it's not called N.
"""N is for new."""
But then that wouldn't work for the old.
"You see,"
I'm here to discuss the Box Tunnel 20.
Come on.
Home sweet home.
It's a shit-hole.
"Yes, but it's our shit-hole, so show some manners."
"I could tell you many stories about cheap BB's like this, George, many stories."
And I don't want to hear any of them.
"- Well, hello."
"- Oh, I thought I heard the door."
"Well, did you hear my heart begin to beat a little faster?"
"No, no."
"No, definitely the door."
You sure it wasn't the buttons on my fly pinging off one by one?
"You know, because of... my lob-on?"
"Oh, you filthy little..."
"- Annie, this is Adam."
- Hello.
Adam is a vampire.
- Isn't that fantastic
- Yeah.
Adam is going to be staying with us for as short a time as possible.
Upstairs.
You can find a room to sit and think about the way you've just behaved.
"- Catch you later, sweet cheeks."
- Go.
- Don't ask.
- OK.
Have you any idea of the trouble your little escapade has caused?
"I mean, have you seen a newspaper in the last four weeks?"
"This is the biggest manhunt for a century, and you're strutting around in broad daylight."
What happens when the police catch up with you?
I'll talk to you later. 10-4.
10-4 and out.
DUD:
Just give the names of the two suspects.
"Ray Malcolm and Lane ""Pluto"" Franklin."
Give a description of the girl and say the victims were stabbed to death.
How many stab wounds?
"No, don't mention that, or the hog-tying or the pillowcases."
What about the three other victims?
Just say they were strangled.
And what about the kid?
Don't mention the kid.
Just say there was a survivor and that we think the suspects fled the state.
Might get us some national coverage and make it hard for them to travel.
You got to give me something.
The press is all over my butt.
Okay.
Play it up that they're as violent as we've ever seen.
Really?
Yeah.
Thank you.
What's the story on this Star City thing?
"Somebody, come on."
Dud?
Would it be a wild goose chase if you went down there?
"We've been lucky so far, and we can tie Ray there."
The police chief in Star City said he didn't know of Ray or Fantasia but he thought he'd heard of the uncle and was going to check them out.
I'm just waiting for his phone call back.
What about an ID on the second suspect?
JOHN:
"They call him ""Pluto."""
His real name is Lane Franklin.
Be my guest.
"I'm not sure if Kai will let you be his, but you might as well try."
Hold on a second!
Hold on a second!
"Yeah, what?"
It's funny.
I think was expecting someone more...
Charming.
"You know, for a rock star."
May I come in?
Who are you?
"Dr. Tom, Erica's therapist."
Thanks.
"So, what, are you tag-teaming me now?"
Huh?
"So, Dr. Fred sent you in here to talk me back on the straight and narrow, convince me I'm destroying my life?"
Erica ever mention to you that she had a brother?
No.
"Well, he died 10 years ago in a tragic accident, one that Erica tried to go back and prevent by twisting this therapy into something that it's not."
Did it work?
What do you think?
So...
"Well, explain to me, Kai... what is it that you want, exactly?"
To disappear.
Why?
"I mean, what is it that you figure that's gonna do?"
"It's gonna make things better for everybody, including me."
"Well, it seems to me you've tried that already, though,"
Haven't you?
"I mean, you ran away from your whole life."
"And yet, here you are again... running."
"Um, I'm just wondering where it ends."
We thought you'd like to see this.
So many of you have expressed an interest in knowing how I was paid.
Now I can afford to go back to my diet.
Tonight's play is about a body.
Not mine.
"However, the title is"
"""John Brown's Body. """
"In my opinion, John, this is the type of furniture we should be making."
Remarkable.
What is it?
"It's a chair, made out of wrought iron and plastic."
It's the latest modern design.
"And this, Harold?"
That's a copy of a new Swedish reversible sofa.
Hmm.
Does a set of instructions go with them?
I'd be afraid to get into that thing.
"Unfortunately, John, our customers are not quite so old-fashioned."
The public is demanding modern furniture now.
Take this sofa.
"My boy, that is not a sofa."
That is a sofa.
"Constructed, not turned out."
"Quality, my boy."
That's what we're selling.
People are looking for something new.
We've got to give it to them.
Chairs made out of scrap metal?
That's not what our customers expect from John Brown and Company.
We'd get new customers with a line of modern furniture.
"Now, Harold, our sales are fine."
We're making money.
Trevor Nigel.
And you must be Richard Castle.
- Yes.
- We've only ever talked on the phone.
Yeah.
Nice to finally put a face to all those notes.
Thank you so much for seeing us without an appointment.
Are you kidding me?
This is fate.
"I'm serious, Rick."
Your name literally just came up in our last story-development meeting.
It did?
"Now, look, I know this studio did a poor job producing Heatwave, but believe me, I fought for your vision."
"And now that I am running the studio, it is time to get back in the Richard Castle business."
"Oh, uh, well, thank you."
I'm flattered.
[Cellphone chiming] But we're not actually here about my books.
We're actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.
"Yes, I heard about that."
It was shocking.
Phil was a great guy.
He saved my ass a couple of years ago.
Got photos of my ex having an affair with our personal psychic.
- Oh.
- Saved me millions.
"[Chiming continues] So, Phillip's sister told us that you gave him permission to go undercover here at the studio."
Yes.
Phil said he was working a new case.
He asked for a favor.
"I owed him one, so I said okay."
Who was he investigating?
He wanted access to Austin Elektra.
You think she's gonna be psyched?
"Totes, dude."
Why wouldn't she be?
So how does this work?
We just--we show up in Amsterdam and we start calling hotels... and ask if they have a Maria staying there?
- I don't even know her last name.
"- Dude, it's totally cool."
We're definitely gonna find her.
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be--
"Sir, I need you to step aside, please."
Let me search you.
- Did I beep?
"- No, you didn't beep."
Just a random security check.
"If you could just step aside, please?"
Just over here.
"- Random, huh?"
- Yeah.
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?
"Kumar, just do what the guy says."
"Sir, it's our job as airport security... to search for all possible weapons or illegal drugs."
"So just because of the colour of my skin, you assume that I have drugs on me?"
"- No, he's--"
"- What are you, a racist?"
Racist?
"Dude, I'm black."
He's black.
He's not a racist.
"Please, dude, you're barely even brown."
"No, he didn't mean that."
"Compared to me, you look like Matthew Perry."
Miss!
The two days are up.
"Still no news of him, something bad must have happened."
What should we do now?
"Miss, it's best if we return to BuYeo first."
It doesn't help if we stay here all day.
I... am going to the bandit's hideout myself.
Miss!
"This is not like you, what's wrong?"
What was I like last time?
You were fast and precise.
Sometimes you outshine even the Chief himself.
"Now, you can't even get your priorities right."
You think I'm taking a blind risk?
It's no different from suicide.
What plans do you have?
!
Don't worry.
"After I heard Prince Ju-Mong went to their hideout,"
I regretted not thinking of it earlier.
"As long as I can get Bae-Mang to drop his grudge against me,"
Then we wouldn't have to go back to BuYeo.
"When I was little,"
I remember Father used to tell me this...
"As a merchant,"
One must learn to make business even with an enemy.
I had forgotten the fact that I was a merchant.
You're saying you want to trade with the bandits?
Why not?
"Uncle,"
Please look after the fleet.
Sa-Yong and I will go to the bandit's hideout.
"I'm sorry, Mike."
ROBERTS:
"I'll get hurt in vesting, at least I'll get partial pension."
Maybe it's for the best.
Wife's coming up.
Got the middle daughter in a ballet recital.
"You know, used to come a time if I went to this recital..."
"... I'dhavemyselfpaged,find  an excuse to go over to Dee Dee's."
"Now I get to see the whole dance of the Enchanted Field Mice, whatever it is."
You want to see me?
You get those test results back?
"Close the door, Larson."
Let me have your gun and your shield.
What for?
Your tests came back with multiple positives.
Steroids--
Hold it.
"Now, steroids are not on the banned-substances list."
Methamphetamines are.
There is no way I tested positive for meth.
That's gotta be wrong.
Testing's sophisticated now.
Can't cover your tracks with sudafedrin.
You're terminated as of tomorrow.
You report to 1 Police Plaza...
... forout-processingin themorning.
Your gun and your shield.
This is a setup.
"If you think that I am gonna sit still for this, you are crazy."
"I am gonna get a lawyer, and I'm gonna sue your asses."
You have two guns listed.
Give the other one to the sergeant before you leave.
"When you want a story, all you have to do is ask."
Bye.
Don't you want to get out of the box?
Can you tell me a story?
People story or animal story?
Happy or sad?
"A thriller, comedy or horror?"
Made-up or real?
A story about people.
Your story.
Mine?
- Don't you have a story?
- Sure.
- Can't you tell me?
- I guess so.
"I was born, and I had a lot of brothers."
My mother used to tell us stories so we should not think about eating.
"Then I grew up, got married and had a bunch of children."
I told them the same stories my mother used to tell me.
"I grew old, my husband died and one by one, my kids went away."
So I kept reciting stories aloud to myself.
I told them in the streets.
Some of the passers-by liked them and gave me some change.
"One day, your grandma came up to me and asked:"
"""Would you tell your stories to my grandchild for food and shelter?"
"She said I could eat myself sick, if I wanted."
"I agreed, so they put me in that box."
"Before they closed me up,"
I asked if I'd get paid on the spot.
"""Once my grandchild opens her present, you can eat,"" she said."
"Well, that's my story."
May I eat now?
What do you expect?
Freakin' animals.
"Like ""Apocalypse Now"" down there."
Like Colonel Kurtz holed up in his jungle.
And my SAC in El Paso sends me home.
"Now, that's a sound leadership decision right there, huh?"
"You don't put your second most senior man on the trail of those motherless bastards, you send him home."
"I was, you know, ""He's out getting an evidence bag, and so ends up without a scratch on him."
"So must be something wrong with that picture""."
So are you home for good?
"No, no."
Playing it by ear.
"""To be determined."""
Think you might want to
- talk it through with somebody?
- What?
A shrink?
"No, no."
I can't.
"Start going down that road, kiss your career goodbye."
Or Marie.
"Or me, if you like."
"You know,"
I don't know how to say this.
"You know, the things I deal with, you and me don't have much of a... what you might call an experiential overlap."
What if I told you we do?
I have spent my whole life scared.
"Frightened of things that could happen, might happen, might not happen."
50 years I spent like that.
Finding myself awake at 3 in the morning.
But you know what?
Ever since my diagnosis...
"- Thank you, Doctor."
"- There were other symptoms, Doc."
"He had hallucinations, heard voices."
Aren't they both associated with glioblastoma?
"I see nothing here to suggest... something as exotic as glioblastoma, Mr. Klein... but if you'd like I can refer Mr. Smallwood to another neurologist... for a second opinion."
- He's wrong.
"- No, that'd be fine."
Thank you very much.
¡Gordon!
Wait.
Wait.
He's not wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
He's not wrong 'cause there's nothing wrong.
There's nothing wrong.
You go to a doctor with a bleeding ear.
and he tells you you got a headache...
"Yes, well, you're not sick, so that is good news."
I wish I was sick.
Then I would know why this is happening.
You shouldn't say things like that.
You should not say that.
"What should I say, Denise?"
I'm hallucinating.
I'm hearing voices.
Was your wife hearing voices before she had her tumor?
No.
"13 News is headed to the scene, and we'll have a live report in minutes."
"Again our top story, Domain Air."
Flight 9 out of Denver has crashed.
An airline representative is expected to make a statement shortly.
- There is hardly any.
"I've heard, ladies used to fancy their dresses, longtime ago."
"But nowadays, why have you ladies become so stingy about it?"
"Now look, what I like to wear is my personal matter."
I see.
"Just like the loafer's personal matter was to whistle, right?"
Any matter which troubles others cannot be personal.
But how does this dress trouble others?
This question suits the loafer who whistled at you.
"An_ay, you seem to be a decent girl from a decent family."
"Ifyou put on some decent dress, then I think it won't trouble anyone."
"An_ay, it's your wish."
"Sawant, take down her complaint."
What's his name?
He just doesn't possess any kind of etiquette.
My case is fixed on the 21th.
And the witness...
Don't talk about the court.
This is a pam.
Have fun.
This is the first time I see you on time.
And...
"Hello, Mr Sahney!"
Have you met my daughter Sheetal?
Hello
"- Sheetal, he is a famous criminal lawyer."
"Mr Sahney, please come with me."
"- Hey, Mr Mehta!"
I've read about your Nihar murder case in the newspapers.
You were just incredible and you won the case.
Really?
Are you interested in such things?
TheWorstof theWorst
"It's her, right?"
Give me the phone now.
No Jik!
Thepersonyouare tryingtocall-
What's wrong?
I told you to give me that girl's number.
"No matter how you look at it, she's messing with a student."
Is Sin Joon Young that great?
Yeah he is.
This girl isn't that weird either.
She's normal but Joon Young is so awesome that he's even able to change her.
I'm not saying that right now.
Don't fall for Joon Young.
-What?
-If your always around him filling the documentary then you'll definitely fall for him.
This rascal...
You dont know Jin Joon.
Joon Young is know a person in a different world now.
Joon Young's saying something without thought.
Don't be mistaken and don't get any useless hope.
You'll get hurt.
Did you eat something wrong this morning?
That's right.
"Those ribs must have tasted weird, right?"
"So that's why I told you to stay away from them and not to eat them, you punk!"
"Noona, I hope you and Hyung will have nice courtship."
Even if he doesn't have anything he's a really good person and you fit with him.
That's the way that you'll be happy.
Then this is the end of my nagging.
No Euly!
Film the documentary well.
(music fades)
"You like that, Stewie?"
You like Anne Murray's music?
Do I?
I've never known such happiness.
This must be what it's like for you when you're buying potatoes or scraping your heels or smushing on makeup for a sad night out.
ANNOUNCER:
This portion of the Channel 5 News at 6:00 is brought to you buy condoms.
"Put us on backwards a little bit, then put us on the right way."
"Mom, Dad, I need to get new sneakers."
What?
I just bought you new sneakers.
"I know, but I need cooler ones."
"Shut up, and stop complaining."
"When I was your age, I didn't even have sneakers."
We wore stale hamburger buns.
"No, you didn't, Peter."
"Shh, he doesn't know that."
"He's just a dumb, fat loser."
Did you see his shoes?
"Look, Chris, I'm sorry, but money's tight right now."
"Yeah, I even had to take a second job as a door-to-door vacuum salesman."
This thing can pick up anything.
Here's a little demonstration.
"I'll pour some wine, rub in some feces, and, to top it off, some mustard mixed with feces."
"Tough stain, right?"
"Oh, crap, I forgot the vacuum."

"[stammers] It really meant a lot to me to have a lot of you there, especially so soon after the loss of my other dog, Noir."
But that's not what I really wanna talk about this morning.
"No, I wanna talk about another best friend that I lost recently."
He went out.
And it was a surprise.
"And it hurt, you know, that it happened."
And that he didn't tell me.
And that he lied to me.
It just really shook me up.
He was my Eskimo.
He got me sober.
I just thought that we could tell each other the truth.
"But today, I'm trying to focus on the positives."
I have this new business venture that I'm really excited about.
And I'm just trying to be grateful.
So thank you.
I'm really happy to be here.
[applause]
"All right, I think that's all we got time for."
Unless someone has a burning desire?
No?
"All righty, let's do the prayer."
"Man, I'm sorry to hear about the dogs."
Really.
- Condolences.
- God... [all] ...grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change.
"The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
No.
Not the seat.
Motherfucking...
"Aw, fuck off."
[mutters] Motherfucking...
- So weird.
"- Yes, yes."
I mean the way people talk.
"I mean, people think we did it."
I know.
It's like we might as well done it anyway at this point.
"I mean, you know, if everybody is talking about it already..."
maybe we...
"I mean, not to make a big deal of it or anything."
Out of what?
Out of anything.
I mean if everybody's...
already assuming it anyway.
"Maybe, we should just..."
"It's amazing the things you notice,"
"Llke the corner of his collar that was coming undone,"
"Llke he was from a poor family and couldn't afford new shirts,"
"That's all I could see,"
"The whole world was that unraveled piece of fabric, I think I have to go."
"- Look, I'm sorry if l--"
"- No, it's okay."
- No pressure or anything.
- l have to go.
You could just think about it.
"It's such a lle that you should do what's ln your heart, lf we all did what was ln our hearts, the world would grind to a halt,"

He got a perfect score on his PS AT.
Do you believe that?
Math will be ruined.
What does this have to do with Angela?
That's when they had sex.
Her and Jordan?
I mean about your being so wonderful and still single and everything.
Who knows what he meant.
"Well, what's so funny?"
"Lottie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself, and at your age."
My age.
His age.
Same age.
"Give a little, take a little."
[Blanche laughing]
"Besides, who'd have him even if he asked me?"
That I'd like to see.
"Well, don't kill yourself laughing, Blanche."
"I may be a size 14, but I could get to be a size 10 for him."
"For a man like that, I could even get to be beautiful."
"For a man like that, a woman would do anything."
Just anything.
"Lottie, you didn't...."
Didn't what?
You didn't kill her?
What?
"Have some more cake, Mom."
"No, not for me."
I'm gonna start cutting down.
"You know, Janie, you wouldn't believe it."
"But when your father and me was married, I weighed only 98 pounds."
"He used to call me ""Peanut."""
Used to brag about my figure to everybody.
"In a nice way, of course."
Funny how a woman lets herself go when there's no man around.
"Well, those afternoon teas that you and Mrs. Armstedder indulge in... don't help either, Mom."
"You know, Janie, sometimes I think Blanche Armstedder isn't all there."
Only sometimes?

"Gee, makes a person afraid to go out on a job."
"You know, I was supposed to sit for the Thompsons tonight."
But now....

"Come on, Lottie, I bet you're just dying to tell me all about it."
"Move over, will you?"
"Well, if that's your attitude."
[slurping]
It's cherry chocolate with tutti-frutti.
[groaning]
There.
"Come on now, tell me."
What was she really like?
"It's a long, long story, Blanche."
"Well, don't worry."
I've got refills.
"Well, go on."
"You know, how I've often said... that sometimes a pretty face will do you more harm than good."
"Well, that Clara Nash was doomed to a violent end."
"Way she was carrying on, she deserved what she got."
"Shame on you, Lottie."
Go on.
You know how particular I am about who I sit for.
"Well, I never would've sat for her."
Except I had a soft spot in my heart for the boy.
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
What a gentleman he was.
"And the way she treated him, he deserved something better."
Did you see the flowers the women's club sent?
When was that?
-Six months ago.
-Right.

"Well, several people came up to me and said:"

Of course you're my sister mom.
I show you the documentation about progress.
You mean you made slides of sexual intercourse?
They're gorgeous you know.
"Hey mom, can I have some money?"
"I have to be right, I'll send you a check allright?"
Allright.
You take American Express?

Can I give you when I left uptown?
No!

"Lucky for you, I'm also off duty."
Isn't that a relief?
I asked what was wrong.
Is my question hard to answer?
Is my answer hard?
If you keep on wrecking her wedding the Sergeant Seo way she'll probably be relieved for breaking up with you.
There's no way she'd regret it.
"But if you go with me, we can make her regret all night."
That was what my answer meant.
It's tempting.
But I have a condition.
"First, turn the rear mirror around."
She's an expert at breaking couples.
But what was the condition?
"From here, I appear."
The person that my father sees as husband material is coming in as a lieutenant.
My father said he was my upperclassman in the army.
He already came.
It's been two days since he came.
He came fast.
"Anyways, say that you're dating me."
You don't like Yoo Si Jin?
His appearance isn't my style.
He looks like a girl.
Cooperate?
"Well,some dads are better with sons"
Than they are with daughters.
My dad was.
Drove my sister crazy.
"When you get into the mock jury room,"
Don't be surprised
If the focus group asks you some questions.
It's a good thing.
It's how we learn what kind of questions
The real jury's gonna ask
When they're sitting in the box at your trial.
Just answer honestly.
Okay?
"Go on,ann."
What happened next?
"After dinner, i wanted to go home,"
"Because i had a test the next day,"
But he wouldn't let me.
"Stein called me names, and he hit me."
"So i grabbed the knife to defend myself,"
And i swiped the knife behind me to get him away from me.
Why didn't you go to a restaurant?
"Well, the hotel was his idea."
I bet.
- Yeah.
"It's got a five-inch-thick door, three-inch walls."
It's got six-sided protection against concentrated attacks with mechanical and electrical tools.
"We keep our ready-to-sell harvest in here, okay?"
"As we rotate it out, we fill it back up."
No cash.
No personal items.
You and me are the only people on this Earth that know the combination.
Watch the hands.
The hands tell you everything.
"I stand corrected, and... disturbed."
Okay... what about our cranky friend over there?
"Sum him up for us, Tony."
Cranky car salesman.
Lonely childhood.
Behind on his quota.
Regretting his life choices.
Not a couple.
And not familiar to either of you?
"Geez, Ellie, let it go."
"I'm trying, but..."
he's right there.
"You know, Tony, I don't mean to pin this on NCIS, but Ellie became much more suspicious about people since she joined you guys."
That is so not true.
"Oh, you really like talking bad guys."
"Well, I have to talk about something, since we can't talk shop anymore."
"When we were both at NSA, we'd debrief every night after work-- but now that he's restricted from telling me anything, all I can do is talk about what we do every day."
Chase bad guys.
"So I get where I may seem more suspicious, but..."
I'm not.
"Hey, why don't I get us some coffee."
"Well, there's Dirk, if it's a boy, obviously, or Oskar, with a ""K."""
Oskar Palmer-- that's a lot of R's.
Hmm.
"If it's a girl, we're thinking, uh,"
"Freda, Greta, Liesel-- something sort of Von Trapp-ish."
"Come on, McGee, up and at 'em."
Workday's over.
We're talking baby names and snow angels.
Can't right now.
For instance?
"You'll need a second in command for that special stunt, Sir."
"Young man, ""stunt"" is a word I do not like."
Not when applied to a military operation.
"Slip of the tongue, Sir."
The Chief Instructor said he put a word in.
He did.
"It's a word I wouldn't care to use, but we'll see."
"A falling object descends earthwards at the rate of 32 feet a second, accelerating to the maximum speed of 176 feet a second."
That's what I call descending.
"You'll be all right, Alf."
As long as you land on that big head of yours.
"Green light on, action stations, Number One, and er..."
Hold it!
"What, may I ask, are you doing up there?"
Practising.
"If you want to be polite to a regimental sergeant major, you address him as ""Sir""."
"Practising, Sir."
Get down from there before I take you to the guard room!
Two volunteers to put him on his bed.
You and you.
At the double!
"Ooh, my leg."
So you're what they're turning out as soldiers these days.
I wanted to see for myself.
Mm.
Mm-hm!
A horrible lot of little men.
Thank God we've still got a navy.
Let's take a look.
... I'll kick him in the...
"First balloon jump 0600 hours, tomorrow."
But I've always been a little sensitive about it.
You understand?
"Oh, I certainly do, sir."
"Lou, Lou, I'm talking, but you're not listening."
(KNOCKING ON DOOR) There's no money in the budget.
"Lou, will you believe me?"
There's no money.
"Look, that's the way it is, take it or leave it."
Good.
Good.
You got yourself a deal.
"What is it this time, Lieutenant?"
I'm a very busy man.
"There was no one out there, sir."
It's all right.
So I just came in.
Congratulations.
Congratulations for what?
I heard you came into a lot of money.
I see.
You heard about my little windfall?
"Yes, sir, I have."
"Lieutenant, if you think I knew anything about this, you're wrong."
My lawyer called me and told me my wife's safe deposit box was practically layered with receipts for these silver certificates.
I'll be damned if I can figure out how she did it.
"I think the government's gonna have a little trouble, too, because she never declared them as income."
She kept the certificates in a numbered account in a Canadian bank.
"And it all goes to you, right, sir?"
And it all goes to me.
After taxes.
Including a few lovely IOUs from Ward Fowler.
"Is that so, sir?"
"Here's what happens, right?"
It's a sexually aggressive badger?
Locks on your leg.
"I'm sure other people have heard this, that you have to carry..."
"Never heard about it before in my life, mate."
Should have backed me up on the fucking film.
Did you find it?
Did you find it?
I've seen badgers.
They never locked on me.
I never smelt like a...
They never smelt me like a competitor.
"The badger will only release when it hears the crack of bone, so you have to carry a stick and if the..."
Is that a real thing?
Yes.
Only when your bone cracks will it let you go?
Look...
They're only about that big.
They can't do that.
"No, they're huge."
You either heard this somewhere...
Or dreamt it.
Or dreamt it.
Would you like me to put you out of your misery?
"The director has come into my ear and said Honkytonk Man was released in 1982, starring Clint Eastwood."
APPLAUSE
"I'm sorry, Johnny."
"He told me that about five minutes ago, but it was much more fun..."
"The period of time where you were going,"
"""Is there nobody here?"
"!"" was more fun."
Carrying a stick.
Come on!
-I hope he's seen it.
-I'm sure he has.
"And with those figures, he will be able to restore the Tardis."
It won't take long.
"Well, while he's sorting that out, perhaps you wouldn't mind explaining something to me."
"Back home in Brisbane, we call that a sweatshop."
This street.
Nyssa.
Nyssa.
Nyssa.
"Nyssa, my dear."
Father.
"They don't smile, they don't talk to anybody."
Their language is the language of numbers.
And they have no need to smile.
No need to smile?
We are a people driven not by individual need but by mathematical necessity.
The language of the numbers is as much as we need.
"Now, it is important that we do not disturb them."
But if they don't talk to each other...
You've done it!
"Yes, there does seem to be some positive development."
"But what is this mission of yours, Father?"
You're so changed by it.
"You look younger, but so cold."
Logopolis is a cold place.
"A cold, high place overlooking the universe."
"It holds a single, great secret, Nyssa, which you and I must discover together."
-And the Doctor.
The Doctor can help us.
"-Oh, yes, the Doctor can certainly help us."
The remaining we shall do it there.
"Brother, you have handled such a big responsibility of mine."
Okay!
It's okay Ameena.
Now we are free.

"When you finally killed him, why didn't you call the police?"
"I wanted to, but I was afraid."
"You hadn't committed any crime, defending yourself."
What was there to fear from the police?
I don't know.
I was just afraid.
You had nothing to fear.
"Until you hid Lucas' body, isn't that right?"
But the moment you buried your stepfather's body you had a great deal to fear.
-That's right.
But you buried him!
You must have had a reason... a powerful reason!
And don't tell it was simply because you were afraid.
-I was!
-Are you sure?
-That is the only reason!
-Fear is panic.
"And clearly burying the remains of a man you just murdered requires cold, careful thought!"
-Objection!
-You knew what you were doing!
-I didn't!
I didn't!
"He's not cross-examining, but harassing the witness."
Objection sustained.
I withdraw the question.
I have nothing further.
Miss Cross... at all times during the quarrel that led to the death of Lucas Cross were you in fear of bodily harm?
"-Yes, I was."
I have no further questions.
You may step down.
I wish to call Miss Allison MacKenzie to stand.
Raise your right hand.
- It's a policy we have.
- A policy?
A policy?
That's a damned bad argument.
"If you want to get on in the world, you need to make decisions."
"When you break policies, you show decisiveness."
"Yes, and I think you should go home."
"You stupid, little asshole."
Who do you think you're talking to?
- Run off and get another bottle.
"- Jorgen, we'll go somewhere else."
I'm not the only one that's drunk.
Coming?
I'm sorry.
Empty already?
Those silly little bottles.
- Mother helped too.
- That's good.
"Helene, I would like to have a party on my birthday."
It would be nice.
"Sure, but is one bottle of whiskey each enough?"
"Jorgen, would you please tell me what this is all about?"
I couldn't be bothered.
We're getting up early tomorrow and driving far.
Why won't you let Jacob go home?
You can't just run our lives in your sick head.
Do you know what really doesn't suit you?
- When you feel sorry for yourself.
- Don't talk to me like that.
But I don't understand what you're talking about!
"What have I done wrong, Helene?"
Can't you tell me what I've done wrong?
What do you mean?
We haven't interfered with your business.
"Shuji, you mean you think I had something to do with the hit?"
"Never, never in a million years would I do anything to disrupt our agreement."
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
Our relationship means everything to me than gold and you know that.
"Come on, shuji, what do you think I am a fucking idiot?"
What are you trying to say here shuji?
Huh?
"Not me, not my family."
Not anyone who has a future on this fucking earth.
"Someone hires a low life piece of shit that worked for me for five minutes, makes it look like my guys puts you and me in a war together."
It's the last thing I want.
Do you understand?
The last thing.
Mr. tendo will be relieved to hear that.
"Well tell Mr. tendo that he has my full respect, huh?"
One thousand percent.
Thank you.
Any time.
So?
It was him.
Really?
Yes.
Now what?
We eat.
Come on lets go.
Come on.
Wow this is a beautiful house.
I always thought you guys ate on the floor or something.
So how do you like Japanese food?
It's good.
Remember Dan Aykroyd in Ghost Busters with that cigarette?
- He does that scene.
- It's hanging vertically.
"I know exactly what you're talking about, when he finds Slimer."
- How'd he get that cigarette to hang?
- It's incredible.
I'm glad that my life's insecurities of thinking people are mad at me got put to good use in this movie.
"- Yeah, it was such a good choice."
"- Oh, Ari."
I've been thinking that a lot lately.
"The phone rings and, ""Hey, we need to talk about something."""
"I always have the impulse now of saying, ""Are you mad at me?"""
"If I had a dime for every time I say that in life, I'd be a rich woman."
You haven't said that to me.
"You've only been like, ""Do you love me?"""
"""Do you still love me?"""
The answer is always yes.
"That's a pretty good one too, right there."
"Oh, my gosh."
- That's hideous.
- We were laughing filming this.
Right?
For some reason?
- We were giggling.
- Why were we laughing?
"Oh, it was when we were doing that shouting thing, which I can't say..."
I can't say because it's a bad word.
Remember the high-pitched shout?
"Oh, yeah."
"Wait, I thought that was in the van."
I think this is where it became invented.
Unfortunately.
Knocking.
Where's Olive?
Olive Snook was where Lily had taken her.
It was a place that valued Olive's silence as much as Lily did.
"Hello, Betty."
A little bee tells me you've met Kitty Pimms.
Briefly.
"Well, this morning Kitty says to me, she says, ""I wanna speak to Betty Bee."
"Bee-Girl to Bee-Girl, tell her how much she means."""
Bless.
"If there's a lull in the conversation, you just ask Kitty why she loves bees."
Oh?
Oh.
- You'll be glad you did.
- Thank you.
"Betty, I know Kentucky was your number one Bee-Girl and I wanna live up to her standard of honey harvesting and sales excellence."
"You're not really going to stand there and kiss my ass, are you?"
Or didn't Woolsey tell you?
He didn't.
How politic.
- Tell me what?
- His acquisition was a hostile takeover.
"- No, he didn't mention the hostile part."
"- Oh, yes."
The ass you were just kissing is now just the ass of a retired honey mascot.
That's my new title:
Honey mascot/consultant.
Used to be founder and president.
That would make me stinging mad.
"I get to keep my old office, just not my dignity."
"When all of your bees die, it's hard to care about any of it."
- All your bees died?
This could be really good for our marriage.
"I mean, if there are things bothering us about each other, we should just get them out there, you know?"
It's healthy.
I guess.
"All right, so come on."
"Hit me, baby."
Uh...
I guess maybe sometimes...
You wear a little too much makeup.
What do you mean?
"Well, just, you know, all that goop over there."
Sometimes I think you could just...
Back her down a notch.
"Ok, this is stinging more than I thought it would."
So you really think I wear too much makeup?
No.
"I just-- like if we're going out for burgers, you know, and I throw on a pair of sweatpants and a baseball hat, you look like you're going to the opera..."
Or you're in the opera.
Ok.
Ok.
I will try to wear less makeup.
"Well, this is great."
All right.
"But we're gonna do this together, ok?"
And I'm gonna join a gym and start to diet.
I'm gonna whip this body into shape 'cause nobody's calling me fatty mcbutterpants anymore.
Somebody called you fatty mcbutterpants?
"On line at the bank yesterday, yeah."
And it took seeing the big and tall bag to push you over the edge?
Mmm-hmm.
Ok.
I dieted for the last 8 hours.
-We push!
Good evening Antwerp!
This is gonna be good!
One Direction One Direction!
"Europe has been so crazy because there's a lot of fans who have been there  for you know a year two years, three years."
And they've just waited for us to come.
"-Three, two, one."
-We push!
"berlin, make some noise!"
"I think we're in the 50s now, Iike 53, maybe 54 out of 1 30-something shows."
So we're nearly halfway there.
You sing.
Sing it.
"Just a natural, really, aren't I?"
"I mean, I don't mess about, that's the main thing for me."
I think the Europe trip so far has just flown by.
When you think about tour rehearsals and everything...
-...it seems such a Iong time ago now.
-I know.
Do you remember when we met at boot camp?
Yeah.
"I just saw you darting around in your beanie every day and just being like, "" Hey, I'm Harry."""
"Those were the days, man."
"NiaII was the loudest person at boot camp, without fail."
"Wherever NiaII was, there was a guitar there was noise and there was loads of people around him."
-He was so popular.
"-Yeah, I remember."
"When we first got together, there was always little clashes."
Yeah.
But there wasn't anything huge.
Do you remember when we went to the coffee shop and Zayn didn't turn up?
-There was a serious conversation.
- How's everybody doing?
- Good.
You?
So far...
There's the little momma.
I got a little something for the kid.
I won it at a fair last night.
That is so sweet.
- I'll see you guys later.
- Call me later.
- Coffee?
"- No, I'm good."
What's up?
Just hearing about these American guys coming into town.
- You know anything about this?
- Do I know anything?
They've been giving my guys a hard time.
Selling good weed for cheap.
"I've been chasing them off, but then they took over the park across the street."
- They coming in here?
- They showed up at my brother's club.
Just a matter of time before we see them here.
We should do something before something gets out of hand.
What about the bank machines?
"I'll have my accountant look at the final numbers, but I think we're done."
You wanna talk about the weed?
You'll have the Eastern connection.
We're looking for commission on deals.
- Are you gonna want to work with me?
- Gonna have introduce you around.
- So we have an agreement here?
- We'll start exploring it.
Never mind.
"I've never even met you, never fucking heard of you, but I know your kind."
You're the spawning infestation of micro-cocked little bitch bloggers who take shots at people who are out there actually doing real shit.
"Nobody likes you, bro."
You're a fucking zero.
You have no friends.
"Jesus Christ, himself, wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire while holding the virgin Mary."
"Keep up the good work, player."
Have a nice day.

Didn't even know you knew that word...

The enemy is you.
How much weight are you gonna lose?
"Um, like 30 pounds."
- Are you starving?
- I could eat.
You're a masochist.
"Yeah, and you're..."
- You're the other one.
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything!
No way.
A guy with just one arm.
We should buy him a barrel organ and give him 2 Mark.
We gotta take care of him!
What use is a one-armed man to us?
What use is a headless man to us?
- Why?
- Because he's starting to make sense.
He just wants to spy on us!
I know what he wants.
I'll test him and take responsibility for his actions.
"Mieze, you gotta look after him!"
They treat him like dirt.
"I'll go and work for him, even if it means playing a barrel organ!"
I know those guys quite well.
You gotta watch out that they won't be a bad influence on him.
Understand?
"Tomorrow evening, right?"
And Biberkopf is really gonna be with us?
Sure!
What's wrong with that?

"I think you guys are talking about postpartum depression, and that totally makes sense."
One out of every seven new moms does suffer from it.
"Yeah, no, no, um..."
"You're saying, no, that's not true?"
"I'm worried that, uh..."
Our kid's just gonna have a shit vibe.
"- Sorry, come again?"
- Okay.
I-
"- I'm, like, ehh..."
You know?
"And he's, like, the worst, so I feel like, when we made a baby, so it'll just be like..."
- Her dad's my boss.
- Gotcha.
"So you're not talking about postpartum depression, you're just concerned that your baby's an asshole?"
"Okay, yeah, like, that's what I'm talking about, too."
"- And, like, off of what she said."
- Right.
"I think, just ultimately, we're mostly afraid that he won't be chill."
"Like, what if he can't hang?"
"Or he hangs too hard and has one too many drinks and does that, like, slow-blinking thing."
Let's open it up.
Any-
- Anybody else with some fears?
Bats.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Okay, I should have been more specific that I meant fears about the baby."
"Okay, I have a fear about my human baby."
"- Okay, great."
- Um...
I'm really scared that my baby's gonna be blind.
-What are you afraid of?
What he will think?
He loves you.
It would ruin his life marry to a girl who...
"Doc, you know not a respectable person in town would accept him."
Respectable!
What kind of respectability are you talking about?
The people with enough money to hire him as a lawyer.
Don't you understand?
We're talking about your whole life!
Prison can be a kind of dying!
Losing Ted would be a worse kind of dying.
"-Besides, you mustn't get involved."
"-Now, never mind about me."
Promise me you won't tell them.
"Promise me, please, promise!"
"All right, Selena."
I'll promise you.
"Selena, you don't seem to realized."
You face a possible life sentence!
-I need much more to work with.
-There is no more.
"Lucas was drunk, brutal."
"When he tried to beat me, I killed him."
Killing in seIf-defense is understandable... but you hid the body and acted like a criminal.
-I know.
-But she was fighting for her life!
The State is sending a prosecutor for one purpose: to convict Selena.
I've seen him work.
"He's competent, relentless as the law itself."
"Yes, tell her to come in."
There must be something you haven't told me.
Do you honestly think the other factions will stand for this?
Because you're so popular?
Get her out of here.
"When that message gets out, it'll be the end."
What message?
You'll see.
I'm gonna put it on every monitor in the city.
WOMAN ON RECORDING:
We have separated you from the rest of us.
And we created factions to ensure peace.
The time has come to emerge from your isolation and rejoin us.
We've allowed you to believe that you're the last of us.
But you're not.

They are vital to humanity's survival.
You did it.
- Yeah.
-Yeah.
Everyone's staring at me.
You changed everything.
(SIGHS) What now?
Only one way to find out.
You ready?
It's been over 200 years.
Who knows what's out there?
You'll never find out.
(GUNSHOT)
I knew Jess Mclntyre would help you.
"- They're helping us, ain't they?"
"- Yes, sir!"
"- Retha, give them boys more chicken."
"- Yes, ma'am."
"You're all very kind, kinder than we deserve."
That's right.
[Innkeeper] You won't have no trouble at all.
"Once folks find out what you're up to, they'll put the big pot in the little one."
"[Innkeeper] Well, look who's here!"
"[Retha] Land sakes, but you're wet!"
"You need some of Retha's cooking, Mr. Andrews."
Sounds mighty good.
Smells even better.
I think I'll get warm first.
Evening.
"[Innkeeper] Retha, fetch Mr. Andrews that peach brandy, you hear?"
"Yes, ma'am."
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have great news."
"On the strength of it, I'd ask you all to have a glass with me... if I knew the color of your politics."
You needn't worry about these boys.
"They've been living amongst Yankees, but they're coming out on the right side."
Good.

- Did Beauregard lick that buzzard Grant?
- [Andrews] Cut him to ribbons.
What about the Yankee gunboats at Pittsburgh Landing?
"100 of them sunk, and thousands of prisoners taken."
"The whole Yankee force, gone up the spout."

Isn't that wonderful?
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm really afraid that our son is going to... be on those dating apps and that his profile pic will be him wearing those new year's glasses where the numbers are the eyes.
Oh...
"And what if he does something totally unforgivable, like rape?"
"Or, um..."
DJ'ing?

It starts in the home.

I got stuck on another awkward date last night.

You need to try the website I'm on.
It keeps dating super casual.
I already tried It's Just Lunch.
It was still awkward.

"When a guy decides he wants to briefly meet you, he'll send you a no-presh, super cash ""slight nod""."
- What a good idea.
"- This Friday, already."
- I think that's a wise decision.
- You can't cope with this.
"- No, it's pointless."
- You can help move her there.
- Of course.
"One wiener, one frankfurter and one with bacon."
- Why didn't you eat any lunch?
- Bodil turns me off food.
The mentally handicapped turn me off food.
One or two rolls?
Lots of people feel that way.
"When I have handicapped customers, they scare all the others away."
- They need to eat too.
- But does it have to be when we eat?
- She'll be fine there.
- The Gimp needs to get rid of her.
He can't bring girls home with her sitting there.
He had sex with her the other day and she just lay there.
He didn't know if she enjoyed it.
"Technically, he could be raping her."
Scary thought.
"It sure makes you appreciate what you've got, honey."
- Appreciate your own good sex life.
- We've got no complaints.
"Good God, no."
I think if we take all of Copenhagen   we're in the top five percent.
"Honestly, honey, is there anything I could do better?"
"Well, maybe just in the oral department."
- Do I give you bad oral sex?
- I didn't say that.
Why did you come in?
You should have called me.
I'm not taking advantage of you?
- You've done three nights this week.
- Don't worry.
If I have one afternoon free that's enough.
I have to talk to the builders about the apartment.
It's in such a mess.
Then I just have to get a photo framed.
My situation won't improve.
Maybe we should tell the clinic and let them decide.
"Look, your husband walked out on you and the kids."
"You come the nights you can, and I'll do the rest."
Between us we'll manage.
Thank you.
- You stopped the intravenous nutrition.
- She didn't tolerate it.
- We can try again tomorrow.
- Yes.
"Now, go on."
- And cheer up.
- Thanks.
Six bulls and one woman.
"Next Wednesday, in the traditional bullring in Brihuega,"
Lydia Gonzalez is going to fight six bulls!
"- That's a lot of bulls, Lydia."
- Good evening.
Why such a drastic decision?
My job is to fight bulls.
"Two bulls, six, whatever they say."
People say a lot of bullfighters won't fight with you because you're a woman.
People can say what they want.
She was just Fanny.
Fatimah Fareeeha Taarhira al-Amatullah.
Not at all like the kind of girl you'd meet back in Illinois?
"Actually, sir, not that different."
When did you find out she was a princess?
"When I asked her on a date, sir."
She told me she wasn't allowed to be seen with me in public.
And yet you spent time together anyway.
We used to meet at the Botanical Garden.
Nobody much went there.
We'd just walk and talk.
"While you were in Al Khair, the only time you had together were these few stolen moments?"
Mostly.
We spent a night together in a jeep once.
"Well, I'm sure the members get the picture."
"Not like that, sir."
I got an urgent message from Ops.
My mom was having an operation to diagnose a tumour.
It was my mom.
I felt like I was a million miles away.
Fanny held me all night.
"Just held me, till I could call my dad and know my mom was okay."
"Why do you suppose Fanny did that, petty officer?"
Because she loves me.
You're sure about that?
"Yes, I am, sir."
And how do you feel about her?
"I love her with all my heart, sir."
And so you broke these laws so the two of you could be together?
"- Yes, I did, sir."
- And you'd do it all again?
"No, sir."

I want a Louis one.
"And then at night, I can just go and say good night."
And that's my favourite hair on Liam.
I just love that one.
Just shed tears just looking at him.
"-Yeah, you've only got the images."
"-Yeah, that's all you've got."
"They become like someone in a newspaper in a magazine, to you."

Never in my wildest dreams would think he'd be this big.
He goes away for so long.
Sorry.

No-arm boxing.

"Not with just my pants on, anyway."
- when he came to the Daily Planet today.
- Doesn't mean he'd take his own life.
He was rattled the last time I saw him.
Desperate to give me something...
A locket.
What does a locket have to do with Lionel Luthor falling 40 stories from his office window?
Mr. Luthor...
I just wanted to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your father.
"When I was a boy... we took a trip together to Washington, D.C...."
It was just the two of us.
"I thought I was just tagging along on another business trip, but... he wanted to show me the Air and Space museum."
He knew I loved things that could fly.
We were looking up at the Apollo 11 command module.
I couldn't believe it went to the moon.
My father held my hand.
"And he told me, ""The right man, can make anything possible."""
You have his locket.
How did you get him to...
"Lionel was a cruel, sadistic man."
What are you suggesting?
No one will ever know.
I promise you.
Where's the key?
It was empty.
My father must have given it to someone.
I asked you to keep an eye on him.
Lionel stopped by the Daily Planet before going to Luthorcorp.
He was spotted in the basement.
Get the helicopter ready.
Of course.
You killed dad for a necklace?
You're not real.
"I believe it, you know."
"In fact, this brother I visited, Celestino, he was a real hijo de una puta."
I remember the day that I finally accepted it.
But I hated him for so much of my life.
"It was like a dam broke inside of me, releasing a torrent of hatred."
Was that the same dam that released the torrent of bullshit that's comin' out of your mouth right now?
"Do me a favor, tough guy, okay?"
Don't tell me this is about some epic clash between two brothers.
This is about you and your needs.
"Cut to the chase, Gecko, or this will become a feeding ground."
I used to think that she was just a dancing girl.
"But now, now I get it."
She's your queen.
That's why I'm gonna bring her back to you.
Your headliner.
I'm gonna bring you back Santanico Pandemonium.
"Kate, help me move this rack."
Come on!
"Come on, let's go!"
We gotta get out of here!

- Ready?
"One, two, three."
[grunting]
I am trying to be civil here!
- [pounding]
"- You know, maybe..."
- Maybe he's not wrong.
- About what?
About the blood well not being such a bad idea.
It could keep the culebras from killing.
"You don't seriously believe anything he says, do you?"
Do you have kids too?
Is your husband unemployed?
Did he mess up while doing business and ask you to bring home money?
What crazy person do you think would marry a beggar like me?
"If it were, would you do that?"
I don't have a husband and most definitely do not have kids.
"I don't have a house, money, or pride, so I'm living with my friend Na Ri."
So what?
"Because of a certain psycho, I got fired from my job, and I will continue to not have money, a house, or a husband."
Is it entertaining?
Is it funny?
Why do I even bother saying these kinds of things to you?
Crazy wench...
-SKYYoonproductionPD.
-Hello?
"-It's me, Yoon PD."
I think you will have to continue working on Sin Joon Young's documentary.
I thought you were switching me out for a different PD.
Sin Joon Young said that he would not film a single scene if you weren't the PD.
He said to cut back on all of the staff except for the production crew.
I think you'll have to come to the company to discuss it.
"You can come now, right?"
Hello?
No PD!
"No PD, are you listening?"
Hello?
"Ah, I'm telling you, it's urgent!"

Has been terminated.
I don't want him back in the building.
You make sure you get his security pass and keys.
Get him out of here!
"Stan, listen to me."
It was my fault too.
"I tripped over the cable, I."
This is not about you.
I've been warning this guy all summer.
"Come on, people."
Let's get that stage reset and make it look good.
"Big, big jackpot on monday."
- Garfunkel?
"- Yeah, I'm probably the biggest garfunkel who ever lived."
"I mean, after all I've done for her."
"You know, I give her money almost every week."
But doesn't she work for you?
That's not the...
point exactly.
Natalie's a human being.
"Now all this attention can throw a person off-balance, especially if it comes suddenly and unexpectedly."
"I once wrote a book on body language, and it... it spent all of three minutes on the best seller list."
"Now I was very young, and I'm sorry to say I became a bit of a diva."
- I didn't like myself very much.
- So now you're on her side.
The question is why aren't you on her side?
Why aren't you happy for her?
Natalie's your friend.
Maybe you're afraid...
She doesn't need you anymore.
Maybe you're afraid of losing her.
- Leon?
"- Leon, Maurice Leon."
- Leon?
But he made up the name.
I don't know what it was before.
Some people called him Moussa and that annoyed him.
You met him on the set?
"No, I met him at a little Algerian restaurant."
Maurice studied at the Sorbonne and at night he made couscous.
"Strange guy, anarchist, atheist, and an excellent cook."
We became friends and one day he told me his story.
I don't know how we suddenly found ourselves working on a script.
A sad love story.
"Like Romeo and Juliet, but in Algeria."
Why didn't you finish the movie?
It was a mistake to begin with.
It was my idea that he direct it.
"I financed it, I recruited all our friends from the Sorbonne."
You realize I was a little in love with him.
I was young and he had a poetic soul.
I thought if we made the film he'd love me as he loved your mother.
That's the story.
We barely managed to film two scenes-.
"Maurice became depressed, he didn't show up and everything stopped."
Want to see?
- See the film?
"- No, there's nothing left of it."
But I have a few photos.
Come.
This is all that remains.
"Pictures, moments."

"Okay, um, not that I care about this challenge, but it's cheating to wear overalls over a suit."
"No, it's not."
"They're not called ""over-T-shirts,"" Robin."
"They're not called "" over shirtless fat guys who used to come fix my mom's car"
"""and then hang out with her upstairs for a little while."""
No.
"They're called overalls, okay?"
And I can wear them over whatever I want.

(CHUCKLES) Challenge accepted.
Good evening.
"Tonight, we're gonna have a nice, quick class on bridges."
There are six types of bridges.
"Beam, cantilever, arch, suspension, and two others."
"You got land on both sides, water in the middle."
See you all next week.
"Hey, we get you for the whole hour."
"Oh, come on."
"I mean, who really wants to sit here and listen to me yap about bridges for an hour?"
Really?
(LILY EX CLAIMS)
I just thought about how awesome Ted is again.
(LILY AND TED LAUGHING)
This is a weird drinking game.
Can I buy you a drink?
(IN SOUTHERN ACCENT) He's got a big brown jug with three X's on it.
What have I done?
One very important thing to keep in mind when designing a bridge...
And he would be a lawyer and I would have his children.
And in the week ends we would barbecue.
And all the other princes and their princesses would come:
"and they would say delicious, delicious,"
"Or, how boring!"
"So I was taught, that I should come to New-York and become an independant model."
And my prince would come and he would be... an agent.
And he would get me a role.
And I would make my living waiting on tables.
I would wait till thirty...
till forty...till fifty.
And I was taught that to be an actress one should be fashionable.
And to befashionable is to be androgenous.
And I'm androgenous not less that David Bowie himself.
They call me beautiful.
And I kill with my cunt.
Isn't it fashionable?
Come on who's next?
I take lessons.
How to get into show business.
"Be nice to your professor,"
be nice to your agent.
Be nice to your audience.
Be nice.
How to be a woman?
Want them when they want you.
How to be free and equal.
Fuck women instead of men and you'll discover a whole kingdom of freedom.
Men won't step on you anymore.
Women will.
"So come on, who's next?"
Who wants to teach me?
"Oh, dear, oh, dear."
"There you are, the senior partner's lot-- disobedience and insubordination."
James?
- What?
"Oh, sorry."
You're looking despondent.
"Not ailing, are you?"
I do feel a bit under the weather.
"Touch of flu, perhaps?"
- No.
Or is it melancholy-- a feeling of mea culpa?
What do you mean?
- Paul cotterell?
"Don't explode, James."
"I know how reticent you are about private matters, but it is Paul's death that's troubling you, isn't it?"
Yes.
"- You can't carry the burdens of the world, especially not a world that's tearing itself apart like ours is."
"He was in despair after I put his dog down, and I can't help feeling that's why he took his own life."
You've got to accept it.
He was a very sick man.
"Come on, snap out of it, or do you want me to get Helen to sort you out?"
"Oh, no, thanks."
That is more than I can take.
Ah-choo!
- Aha!
"Our seasonal friend, I'll hazard."
You hazard away.
"This winter, I stay germ-free."
I'm off on my visits.
"Likewise, me to surgery."
"Wrap up warm, James, and..."
"Stay away from the cold, empty place..."
"Well, if you're implying that mr."
Stark would ever...
I'm implying you.
Mr. Stark's on the run.
He is also...
An innocent man.
I can see why he hired you.
"You're smart, cool-headed, extremely loyal,"
"Which is surprising,"
Considering you were charged with treason.
There you go.
Stay on him.
"Oh, yeah."
It's right here.
There's not much in there.
But seeing as whatever you did's
"Been swept under a rug, I'm guessing"
"It's a big green one made of stark money, hmm?"
So you dodged the treason conviction.
But you couldn't get out of the dishonorable discharge.
"Well, I guess money can't buy everything."
This looks bad...
"Bad to every good man who ever served,"
"Bad to your friends, neighbors..."
And to the fine folks at the office of immigration.
"Yeah, I'm putting that on the table."
That'll be a fun conversation to have with the wife.
Yeah?
"""honey, pack a bag."
"""spot of bother."
"We're being deported."""
you know what?
I've made a deal with Jacob.
You should be happy.
"If you're so bored, get another job or a hobby."
Instead of going around making my life hell.
"Fine, as long as I get peace."
Helene!
I must admit it got a little wet.
- I hope I didn't scare you.
- It takes more than that.
- How about a drink?
- It's a little early.
"I've changed the plans a little, so it will take a few more days."
Why?
I can't do that.
I need to be back in two days.
Listen.
Instead of an annual donation -
- I've talked to my advisors about establishing a fund.
It means something to all of us that you're Anna's biological father.
So I'm establishing the fund in Anna's and your name.
You two will decide how the money is spent.
So you've chosen my project?
- I just said that.
- And you want me to do it with Anna?
"Yes, why not?"
She has shown a great interest in aid work.
My advisors have gone through everything and agree   that a sum of 12 million dollars is realistic.
- 12 million dollars?
- I know the dollar is low.
All kidding aside.
"You can quickly see   that it will cover a whole year for 65,000 children."
"Including room, board, school and administration."
- Where are the movies?
- They're getting away.
- Somebody get a rope!
- Let's season 'em!
- Have we crossed into enemy territory?
- I hope so.
- Where the hell is Klinger?
- At last.
A friendly face.
I knew this would happen.
Klinger would be back with our cosmetics by now... if you hadn't sent him off on a wild-fish chase!
You've completely destroyed the morale in this camp.
Let me know if that crowd gets out of control so I can go out there and egg 'em on.
- I take it you haven't heard from Klinger.
"- No, but I'm sure... we'll get a postcard from Toledo any day now."
"Oh, come on, Colonel."
Just 'cause he's a little late?
You call it late.
I call it permanently skedaddled.
How could you three-day suckers give Klinger a blank pass?
That's like the warden asking Willie Sutton to lock up the hoosegow.
"- Colonel, you're just jumping to conclusions."
"- Well,jump on this."
He took his footlocker with him.
Ayear's change of duds to go with his change of scenery.

[ Horn Honking ]
- [ All Cheering ] - [ Hawkeye ] What took you so long?
"Please, please."
An artiste cannot be rushed.
"- There you go, sir."
Sure...
But this is not the most important thing in life.
What is most important in life?
To live in harmony with yourself and feel free.
We seem to have problems with that.
You're wrong.
This is the first place I have felt truly free.
"You're joking, aren't you?"
No.
You only value what you lose forever.
We have lost the illusion of freedom.
But we were never free in reality.
We had some troubles and communal inconveniences.
Freedom is the ability not to depend on circumstances.
It is the ability to think.
It is victory over your fears.
Do you ever feel fear?
Sometimes.
Freedom has nothing to do with bars and locks.
Somebody gave an order to do away with me.
Who did it?
My business partner?
He has been dreaming of getting rid of me for a long time.
Sell the control package of shares.
The Americans are offering great money for it.
Sell your shares to me.
I'll buy them.
May be it was Marmazin?
He is an oil-trader.
He is an authority.
"- Hey, bro!"
- He feeds the cops from his hand.
"From the information I see, they already received money for food."
Why are they still saying they're starving?
How is it possible?
"They probably spent the money somewhere else, that's why they're saying they're hungry."
"The children say they do not want to be treated as beggars, so they don't want to take it."
Children these days really like to lie.
Don't be fooled.
"There are many children like this, who lie and instead spend their money at the internet café."
What if it is you?
"If it was you, would you choose to starve or to play games?"
What?
!
You!
Who are you?
What are you doing?
You... you!
Me?
I hate seeing children go hungry.
The people have paid so much taxes.
I want to know why children are still starving.
That... what is that?
Are you implying that I pocketed the money?
I'm not sure who is lying.
This is really strange.
I said that you're the one.
"No matter what, please get them corrected after your confirmation."
I need to use the restroom.

"I'm a registered nurse, just like all these women here."
"When they came into the army, they were made officers automatically."
"I should've been, too, but they made me a lousy private."
The army won't recognize me as a nurse because I'm a man... so I spend half my time pushing a stupid broom.
"- He's right, you know."
- This man's army is very discriminating.
You bet it is.
"You got a lot of nerve, buddy."
"Look, pal, I don't make the rules around here."
"If the service isn't your cup of joe, fine."
I'm not here to shanghai anybody.

"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
Hold on.
I haven't made any threats.
I'm the one who needs help here.
"Okay, what exactly do you want?"
What have you got?

- Other people were bribed?
Did any witnesses lose interest?
How good are your records?
- Very good.

No.
That's the pot calling the kettle black.

Excuse me?
Did I say that?
I'm sorry...

- Why did you sabotage Betty's Bees?
- Why?
Because Betty had it coming.
Intention was to quit before I got caught.
- Who caught you?
- I couldn't see his face.
Or her face.
All the lights went out one by one and then there was a terrible hum.
"Then, out of the darkness, it came for me."

"Well, because I was..."
My face was completely obscured in shadow just then.
"This was, like, the coldest night ever."
- This is as bad as it got.
- Poor Alexis...
- It's true.
"...who has, you know..."
"Weighs, like, 5 pounds and didn't have any clothing."
"Also, we were like on..."
- We were near the bay.
- And on the water.
- You were right on the Hudson River.
- Hudson River.
"It was, I don't know, 3 or 4 in the morning and it was probably about 5 or 10 degrees."
- This was the day...
He's gonna abandon that car.
We'll find it.
It'll tell us where he's going.
Watch this.
Keep your eyes on the guard.
Look at his holster.
The safety strap's unfastened.
Wait a minute.
"What the hell is he doing with a gun, anyway?"
"Weapons are for towers, gates and transports only."
- Maybe it was a rookie mistake.
"- No, not a rookie mistake."
He's in on it.
He wanted Dawkins to have that gun.
What's in it for the guard?
"Whatever it is, it was worth putting an armed and dangerous fugitive back on the streets."
Hey.
"Billy Omana, right?"
- Yeah?
"- Yeah, put those on."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, he said put them on."
Who the hell you guys think you are?
What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Billy, if you answer incorrectly one more time, we're gonna put those scrubs on you, drop you in the general population."
- How long you think you'll last there?
"- Heh, you can't do that."
This here says I can.
"Dawkins said if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand."
And you believed him?
"He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account."
I don't understand.
"No, no, no."
Please!
"Please, I'll be quiet."
I don't want to go in there!
I promise I'll be quiet.
"No, don't!"
"No, don't!"
"Please, I'll be quiet."
Please!
I want to go home!
Please!
"I wonder what the unsub meant by ""eleven."""
We know he measures the time spent in each house.
It could be some sort of countdown.
"What are you thinking, Aaron?"
The hospital report on Ellie Zumwalt.
Her injuries were minor.
It was the gradual loss of blood that caused her to lose consciousness.
"Well, the unsub must have thought she bled out and left her for dead."
That was his big mistake.
I don't think there was a mistake.
What do you mean?
"What if Ellie Zumwalt was never meant to die, that the mistake that the unsub made was actually at the first crime scene?"
The Brewer murders?
The guy's a family annihilator.
He killed them all.
To me that sounds like mission accomplished.
We didn't understand why he used two different murder weapons on Jim and Lyla Brewer.
That's because there never was a second weapon.
I'm still not following.
"Dave, you said that a large piece of furniture was moved to block the top of the stairs at the Brewer house."
- More of a fight.
She beat me senseless.
That must have taken at least ten seconds.
"15 seconds, actually."
"We're about to be sent to Devil's Island,"
Tarby's coming for an important dinner party and you're babbling on about your insane mother.
We're up plop creek with no loo brush.
- I'll telephone my agent.
"- Good idea, let's blame him."
Yeah.
"Hey, what if he won't take the rap?"
"Say we'll go to the papes about his ""children's catalogue""."
Nice thinking.
"Hello, Filthy?"
"God bless, look after Mum, drive safely."
"Listen, you filthy, evil porno merchant, me and Eddie are in trouble."
"Unless you take the blame, we'll tell the world the truth about your ""stage school""."
"Please, daughter, please."
Please.
"Listen, I am not a well man."
"This morning, I coughed so hard I sucked my trousers up my backside."
"Now, listen, Richie."
Nobody needs to take the rap for this.
What you have got to get yourself is an alibi.
"Don't shout, daughter."
There's only so much an agent can take after only one bottle of aspirin.
"Now, look, alibis are easy."
"You're a comic, right?"
"Well, loosely speaking, of course."
Yeah.
You were doing a show.
"No, no, that's easy."
"When I'm sad, they're here for me."
"Oh, my God!"
They're just genuine guys.
We love them because they sing our feelings.
They say what we want to hear...
"-...and no boys, no one, says to us."
-Yes.
They can't be real.
They make us believe that everything is possible if we believe in ourselves.
I know they love me.
Even they don't know me.
I know.
They have changed my Iife.
"It may sound cheesy, but they have."
"We love you, One Direction!"
I'm right in front row!
You sing!
"Here we go, O2!"
think our fans are dedication at its best.
hat they've done for us  in three years is just....
It's unheard of.
here was this group  of what called superfans.
And they were like promoters.
"Go on, spread the word!"
So start tweeting and I literally made it my Iife.
"I've sent like 1 6,000 tweets."
I was tweeting from Japan.
"hat was quite mad  watching our witter just gradually, Iike, keep totting up."
"hese girls are crazy about One Direction, and I've got no idea why."
I'm not a neuroscientist.
As soon as Directioners listen to music and find the music pleasurable what happens in the brain is that a neurochemical called dopamine is released and provides feelings of joy and happiness.
Shivers.
"The idea is to keep girl from leaving, not drive them away."
Frannie'd have found a way around this.
"Let's play ""What would Frannie do?"""
Go with me girl.
She'd make Lizzi cry.
And?
Tie her up and put her on a basement somewhere.
I don't know.
- The Kappa Taus have a basement.
"- Buffalo Bill, let's put a pin in that."
Wait...
- You have an idea?
- Yeah.
You just have got to be the #1 weapon on the fight for abstinence.
I thought you enjoyed being ravaged by me in super places.
It's like we're secret sex spies.
I say we remove cars from our list of spy places.
"We're running out of places, library, aiport,"
- that church.
- We'll be more creative for the future.
You believe we have a future together.
Hypothetically.
"In a world where there's no Casey, you're a one-woman men and people don't gossip."
"Miss Logan, I'm surprised you worry about such things."
I don't.
But maybe you do.
You're not contradicting me.
Which is why secret sex is so appealing right now.
No complications.
Get out.
I have class and we can't be seen together.
It'll blow our cover.
Hmm.
I wasn't ready to do the kind of dancing she wanted to do.
Wow.
High school me would've hated high school you.
"If we're doing this, we should do it right."
Chaperones are prom secret service.
"It's like I keep trying to tell you, Boo-- stop talking to me."
"Look, tonight won't be so bad."
All we have to do is stand around.
I'm gonna act like I did at my own prom--
I'll be aloof and above it all and judge everyone.
"- You'll seem different, but not."
- Yeah.
"Guys, none of us are gonna take this that seriously--"
I now take that back.
"[ To tune of ""Bridal Chorus"" ] ♪ prom, prom, prom-prom ♪"
"♪ prom, prom, prom-prom ♪"
[ Gasps ] Prom!
Yikes.
Dudes.
Weak.
How come I'm the only one who's in the prom spirit?
'Cause you're the only one insane enough to think that we're gonna jump aboard your crazy train.
"Ellie, I caught some of that, and I don't think I liked it."
You know what sucks?
The fact that I'm the only one that is weird enough and goofy enough to take this as a chance for us all to have a little fun ourselves.
That's what sucks.
- [ Door opens and closes ]
- O...
M...
Gigi freakin' Fernández!
[ Both giggle ]
"Hutchinson, what would you say to tantalum foil here?"
"- Good idea, sir."
- Oh.
"After all, you're the doctor."
"Hey, old-timer, I'm lookin' for Colonel Potter."
"Could you speak up, sonny?"
My bird and I are a little hard of hearin'.
"Sorry, sir."
"Uh, I thought, uh..."
"Eh, that's okay, Sarge."
I'm subbing' for my company clerk.
- What can I do you for?
"- Sergeant Joe Vickers, sir."
Area retention officer.
I've got the names of your enlistees who are due for discharge.
I wanted to talk to them about re-upping.
I trust you brought your portable torture kit.
"[Laughs] No high pressure from me, sir."
I just wanna point out the big picture.
"You remind me of a ""feller"" who once tried to sell me a dead mule."
Said it'd be no problem to feed and it didn't kick.
"[Laughing] That's a good one, sir."
Uh...
"Oh, I have this, uh, memo for you too, sir."
"As, uh, C.O., you're obliged to try to get your officers to, uh, extend their tours."
You'd better talk to the commander about that.
I'm just the company clerk.
"## [Humming] Oh, Charles."
Read any good books lately?
Professor Hutchinson just came in.
Why don't you go over and thank him for that lesson he taught you today?
"Bandy your japes, apes."
Not that much.
Most people did what you did.
They saved or they paid down debt.
We don't want people to save and reduce debt?
"We do, but when the next guy's president."
- You win.
- I always do.
"Yes, sir."
- I'll tell you what I find interesting.
- What's that?
"You. $35,000 a year, a sister to support and you gave $ 1435 to charity?"
I'm not sure that check isn't better off in your hands.
"Oh, I'm taking it."
Don't be ridiculous.
"When you get to your place, you're gonna find a DVD player and that wimp-ass Bond movie."
- Mr. President...
And I threw in Yeoman of the Guard on CD.
- That was an incredibly nice gesture.
- I'm really something.
Mr. President.
"- Hey, John."
"- Could we have a minute, sir?"
- Yeah.
"- Charlie, get that woman on the phone."
I'm feeling magical tonight.
They're in the tunnel.
The readings show nothing beyond the predictable level of radiation.
"The flatbed's back on its way, and the Carlsbad is behind gates."
- So we dodged a bullet.
- Yeah.
"We pack this stuff in two inches of stainless steel, four inches of lead."
We rammed it with trains and dropped it from helicopters and it still isn't gonna protect us from the thing we haven't thought of.
You dim little shit.
I hired you out of pity and this is how you repay me.
"Tomorrow, when people find out that your precious president.."
helped a maniac open the nuclear football..
"who do you think they're going to believe, you or me?"
"You, you would be a nobody."
"But me, I'm the president of the United States."
"No, you're not."
"Eli, Eli."
"Quite the politician, huh?"
You did all of this just to keep your buddies in the defence industry happy.
How far did you fall into their pockets?
This is ridiculous.
"Take him into custody, general."
"Yes, sir, Mr. President."
"No, I'm still president."
I am still president.
"Well, just consider this a coup d'état."
Get this trash off my lawn.
You're not fit for office.
You son of a bitch!
You're selling this country out to the Arabs.
This isn't over.
I got friends.
And I'll make sure all of your friends meet you in prison.
Let's get him to the hospital.
You okay?
You look terrible.
Thank you for everything you did today.
Thank you for trusting me.
Special Agent Cale!
I'm not going anywhere without my protection.
- That's just me.
- Yeah?
"Well, I'm starting... the bottomless trend."
"Hence, the bottomless party."
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.
- Where are you going?
"- Bang bang, buddy."
Listen.
I'm really sorry to bother you with this.
- You all right?
- Not really.
"They were locked up for less than an hour, and they already escaped?"
Damn it.
Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.
Don't need the public thinking we're some two-bit operation.
"Got it, sir."
It must have been either al-Qaeda or North Korea who broke 'em up.
Find out if they have any relatives in the country.
You probably should have done that in the first place.
"Do you have a problem with the way I'm running the show, Beecher?"
I'm just saying that...
I've looked through the files on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.
"Other than a couple of traffic tickets, they're clean."
Right.
That's why they just broke out of prison.
But they--It's not even clear that they should have been there in the first place.
Shut your--
"You see this cute, little white girl, Beecher?"
Yeah.
"When John McGarrett was investigating his wife's murder, he found a lot of evidence, bits and pieces."
Not all of it made sense to him at the time.
You recognize those numbers?
Can't say that I do.
It's an offshore account.
CIA used it to fund black ops.
"If I gave those numbers to a reporter friend of mine and he started digging, who knows what he might come up with."
Or how high it goes.
What do you want?
Doris McGarrett.
I need a location and a phone number.
"Take my advice, Joe, and just walk away."
This one's too hot.
"Steve McGarrett wants answers, Sam."
He's not gonna quit till he gets them.
I'll tell you what.
Because we're friends...
I'll give you the information you want on Doris.
You can decide how much of it you want to share with her persistent son.
It may be the better part of valor to keep him in the dark... once you hear what I have to say.
MAN:
"Eternal rest grant unto Billy, oh, Lord."
And let perpetual light shine upon him.
"May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace."
Amen.

Ready.

There are many such interesting and sensational cases.
"Now that we know each other, I'll tell you about it in leisure."
What are you doing tomorrow evening?
Nothing.
Why do you ask?
- l have some work with your father.
A good reason to meet you too.
No place for reasons.
You can drop in at any time.
"I must leave now, Miss Sheetal."
So early?
- Even I have to work for a living.
"And this fool had to drop in now, you see."
Bye!
"Sheetal, meet Vijay."
And she is my daughter Sheetal.
"My dear, he is a daredevil police officer."
I see?
"So, he is a police officer?"
"I don't understand one thing, daddy."
The crime is on the rise day by day.
What does the police do about it?
"Mr Sahney, our police force and the C.l.D has set an example for the world."
"But, this fact is known only by few educated people like you and me."
Fools and illiterate people just ty to find flaws in it.
But we must not take them seriously.
What do you think?
"Am I not right, Miss Sheetal?"
Perhaps.
"But Daddy, if our police force is so effective then why doesn't crime cease?"
"Mr Sahney, if not cease, crime can be reduced."
But the people must also understand its responsibilities.
"No, not really, I suppose."
But I have made a prudent judgment that it meets the conditions set down in The Ritual.
You would want to do the exorcism yourself?
Yes.
It might be best to have a man with experience.
Someone who's spent time in the foreign missions.
"I understand, Your Excellency."
Let's see who's around.
"In the meantime, I'll call you as soon as I know."
"Thank you, Your Excellency."
"Well, he does know the background."
I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist.
"There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway."
What about the exorcist?
Have you any ideas?
How about Lankester Merrin?
I had a notion he was in Iraq.
I read he was working on a dig near Nineveh.
"You're right, but he's finished."
He came back three or four months ago.
He's at Woodstock now.
"What's he doing there, teaching?"
He's working on another book.
"Don't you think he's too old, Tom?"
How's his health?
He must be all right.
He's still running around digging up tombs.
"-Besides, he's had experience."
-I didn't know that.
"Ten, 1 2 years ago, I think, in Africa."
The exorcism supposedly lasted months.
I heard it damn near killed him.
You just missed out on the night of your life.
(PANTING) The night of your life.
I've been in love with her for five years.
I've been in love with her for 12 years.
I've been in these overalls for an hour and a half.
"Hey, maybe you can't dunk anymore, but you've achieved more in your 30 years than that 15-year-old dweeb could ever dream of."
You put yourself through Columbia Law School.
You had the sense to chop off that stupid rat tail.
And you married a smoking-hot chick who looks nothing like your mother.
I think that earns you an entire foot closer to dunking.
"There you go, Vanilla Thunder."
Step back.
(MARSHALL SCREAMING)
"Oh, baby."
"How about instead of dunking, we go up to your office, and you lie very still while I go bananas all over you?"
MARSHALL:
Could we maybe instead just do it right here?
"Sure, baby."
- She loves me!
- But I chose her!
Guys!
Guys!
"Guys, we have to figure this out."
We are dealing with a very small window of opportunity here.
"Guys, let me assure you, if you let me in there, that window's gonna open up again in, like, 10 minutes."
"- Wait, where's Maggie?"
- She's gone.
- What?
- I sent her home.
You guys were like vultures fighting over her.
Let her be single for once.
- Jealous bitch!
Now this truck contains somethin' in addition to just cologne.
- Somethin' like what?
- A bag full of money.
"The weird part, is the guy called us up... and had the stones to taunt us after he did what he did."
- Stones...
- Or some kind of a death wish.
Cos he all gave us his address.
"His name and number, was clear as day the whole time he was fuckin' with us."
Culpepper lives about three blocks from this dude.
She's checked him out.
"Says he leaves in the morning, comes back in the afternoon."
"When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him."
And that's that.
"The landlord's on our team, so the door will be open."
- Better be.
"- Relax, the door will be open."
And you don't have to worry about the noise either.
- Why not?
- The building's almost empty.
Switching over the condos or some kinda gentrificational kind of shit.
"You sure this guy was working alone, Russ?"
Pretty sure!
Landlord said the guy's a loner.
This happens tomorrow.
- Can you handle it?
- 'Course we can handle it.
You got the specs?
Now we good?
"Yeah, we good."
"Come on, Daze."
Hey you guys hear about Barbie Sunday's new dress?
- Yea we know.
What do I know?
They...
They are very...
- Are you ill?
- No.
I only wish to lie down for a minute.
I have a room just to the side where you can relax.
"It's all right, everyone."
She's going to be all right.
- What do you suppose is wrong?
- She's probably pregnant again.
There's George.
Excuse me.
I have no desire to speak to that woman.
Chopinsky!
You hiding from George too?
You would know the reason.
I don't want to spoil a good drunken stupor by imagining your reason.
"Ever since the latest chapter of her egregious memoir was published,"
I can hardly show my face anywhere.
Did you read her latest novel?
"It's not literature, it's drainage."
She only wrote good books when she was with me.
Every morning while she was sleeping I'd cross out half her adjectives.
Hercules could not have done it.
He'd have rather cleaned out the bloody stables.
Know what's funny?
- She doesn't come.
- Oh.
"She makes a lot of pretty noise, but she can't come."
Like her books...
lovesick posturing and pretence for quick money.
"Last month, I had to lay him off, two weeks shy of retirement."
Lawrence did not take it well.
What the hell was that?
"Doc, I don't have all year to figure this out."
I told you I needed to study Wickes.
You just watched him for two hours.
Yes.
And then you blocked my view at the critical moment.
"First mention of AUTEC, all I saw was the back of your big fat head."
I can't even confirm now that he was involved in the blackmail.
Looks like Ridgeway might be.
"Oh, you think Wickes was rattled enough to give up a partner just like that?"
"Or he's just telling us what he knows, and he's innocent."
I didn't try to block your view.
I didn't try to ruin anything.
That's it?
Is that all you have to say?
No.
Lawrence Ridgeway.
TONY:
Say hello to Lawrence Ridgeway.
"A spry 62, and loving it."
"Third-generation steelworker, hired at Wickes Steel when he was just a kid."
"Dedicated employee, sort of like yours truly."
"By the way,"
I want to thank you for allowing me to participate in the SECNAV op.
Thank the Doc.
She's the one who chose you.
"Yeah, I thought your game show host quality would be good for the stage."
Ziva?
ZIVA:
Ridgeway has had a rough year.
"This is in Corsica, it's a man whom I loved very much."
I photographed him in a field...
Which he owned in a certain way...
It's land that...
That was his heritage from his uncle in Corsica.
It's a picture taken 5 or 6 years ago.
I particularly like the sun in the tree over here.
"And this man, standing straight in front of the tree."
I took it because that's kind of his empire.
"When seeing him there, I told myself that..."
"That this land is his own, and he's standing there..."
"I've always envied that - people who have a land, a place..."
A belonging.
I've never had that...
"I also loved him for this, actually..."
Therefore it's a sentimental picture.
"That's why you took it, because he was there..."
"Well no, there's no real explanation for this..."
It's just a sentimental picture...
All pictures are sentimental.
What do you think about it?
I don't know.
You never know.
Never mind.
It's in London.
That's more recent.
It's in a pub in London.
"In the day, we were having lunch."
A very British pub.
I really like pubs.
Their... sort of darkness...
At that time I didn't photograph myself yet...
They mustn't get away.
"Come on, we must get to the other side."
Step on the gas!
"Ah, yes, thank you."
I'm glad I can show you our problems on the spot.
- We've just received this radio message.
"- OK, thank you."
"Gentlemen, perhaps we should propose a toast to our president Ramírez."
May our relations always remain as positive as they have been thus far.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Thank you.
...images of the plane that was shot down as it was approaching the runway.
"There were 185 children aboard the plane, who were on their way home."
Both the children and the crew died.
Enrique Carrasco is held responsible for the attack.
He was seen at the airport at the time of the attack.
/t seems certain that he committed this inhuman crime...
- What do you think about this?
- We didn't catch Carrasco.
He escaped.
No one who has seen these images will help him.
He's finished.
- It's got stuck in the tree.
"- Come on, let's climb up."
- I've got it!
I've got it!
- Come down and show it to us.
Show it to us.
What does it say on this piece of paper?
Nothing important.
They're asking the guerrilleros to surrender.
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war than the typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in a uniform, like every mother's son."
That is if he ever had a mother.
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub spawning spontaneously in saw dust."
No.
"A lot of men are scared we won't go into our boxes, when this is all over."
Makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied it.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
What's this?
Lunch.
"Girls compile the boat at home, right?"
"They compile it, the bloody boat... they can lead the damn fleet for all I care!"
But Johnnie.
Freeze the propeller.
You're late!
I took the liberty of ordering.
It's alright.
"We've guests, eh?"
Friends from Poland.
Things are very bad in Europe.
It's not exactly a picnic here.
If you haven't noticed.
You can't find a decent waiter in service since they joined the war.
"They all got rounded up in so called ""Enemy of the State""."
Apart from Jepetto over there.
Rumor is that he is a spy.
Ceres.
Huh?
How 'bout Yale?
Collateral damage.
Acceptable losses when you consider that with interest there's over twenty million in Kozlenko's account right now.
"Aw, c'mon partner, just think what we could do with that money."
"You been planning this for a long time, huh?"
Nah.
"You know, you got out when you should."
I stayed too long.
"I got bounced around, passed over."
"You know, the last time I really enjoyed the game was Berlin."
Right before the wall came down.
"So, you started thinking about the money."
"Yeah, checked some records."
It was forgotten about.
"I mean, c'mon, it's all sitting there, right there."
"I think I'm gonna follow your example, bro, and not share."
You are gonna tell me your code numbers and Marta's code numbers.
Oh.
"Oh I know you way too well, partner."
Yeah?
Yeah.
You're not gonna shoot me.
You couldn't pull the trigger.
You're right.
The only thing I'm gonna regret is that you won't remember what an asshole you've become.
I wonder what two shots would do?
"So, how did it go?"
Couldn't have been smoother.
They didn't ask any questions?
Transferred all the funds to a new account in the Cayman Islands.
Oh baby.
What we want to talk about is...
"They keep you pretty busy out there, don't they, Chief?"
Sure.
You got six people dead out there all at the same time.
We don't get that here.
Sometimes we get a stabbing.
"Colored boys, generally."
Just like out there.
One of them sticks another one over a card game or some shit.
"Chief Dixon, I think we should discuss..."
Craps sometimes.
You were wanting to know about this boy's uncle.
I think we hit the jackpot.
The uncle's place is the damnedest hideout I've ever seen.
"It's out in the woods, northeast of town, over this old rickety bridge."
You couldn't find a soul out there if you didn't already know where to look.
"You boys being from the city, you'd be lost in 10 minutes."
"But I'll be with you, so you don't have to worry about that."
"Damn, Bonnie."
Excuse me?
"Oh, nothing."
CHERYL ANN:
They were out of onion rings so I got you tasty taters.
"It's L.A., Cheryl Ann."
Chief Jenkins and them.
"Yes, sir?"
Will this be a promising avenue of investigation?
"Oh, it's a promising avenue, all right."
Me and my deputies can start setting up a surveillance now.
"Chief Dixon, why don't we hold off on that until we get a game plan?"
"Well, if you say so."
JENKINS:
"Brother, it can turn death into life."
Good sword!
"Brother, your 8-divine Sword is fantastic."
"Yue-lam, you must have suffered a lot."
"Otherwise, I would not have been able to learn Chin Kang Fist and 8-divine Sword."
"Brother, I know how much you love kung-fu."
What I've done is worthwhile!
Good girl!
But I wonder if I learned it thoroughly enough.
It'll be alright!
"With His Highness's background, he can learn everything."
"Your Highness, you'll be the ruler of the martial arts world."
Sung Chi!
Each faction has its characteristics.
All parties are getting stronger and more formidable.
And they are all Han.
It's a threat to our Dynasty!
You're right!
But don't worry.
I have an idea that will destroy both parties.
What's your idea?
"Your Highness, Shaolin and Wu-tang are traditional rivals."
We can kill two birds with one stone.
How?
"Your Highness, order the two factions to merge into one."
So that they'll fight each other!
"Right, they'll fight each other!"
But that's against the spirit of kung-fu.
Yue-lam!
You must understand that this is my duty.
I've got to do this!
Teach him starting from tomorrow.
brat!
Looks like you want a double suicide.
But you're going to make your trip to Hell alone.
Don't make me laugh.
Who could be beaten by a brat like you?
Don't you get it yet?
That armored suit is as good as a toy in front of me.
Why don't you stop profaning God's temple with your blood already?
God's temple?
Where is God in this room?
and the one who wields it is God.
Which part of this extermination equipment is God?
!
is only given to the chosen one.
A person like you has no right to be on this ark.
You're just another person who's being used!
You're just an expendable item to your government!
Don't you see that?
!
My plans no longer have anything to do with the Pentagon or the Machiner's Squad.
I'll judge these rotten human beings with my own hands.
You've gotta be kidding!
Stay back!
You bastard..!
He's dead.
"Project name... ""Cosmos."
The Pentagon's special experimental unit in which elite killers are trained since childhood.
Number 43.
Don't call me by a number.
Yu Ominae....
I've heard the rumor... didn't you?
Number 43!
There's two sides to that.
I made a mistake.
"Look, you know more about this sort of thing than I do."
I don't want you thinking that we're incompetent down here in Star City.
"Let me tell you, Dale, you got the energy and dedication of 10 cops."
No shit?
No shit.
"Say, Dud."
"Let me ask you about something else I was thinking about, and if I'm full of shit, you just tell me, all right?"
All right.
"Well, sir,"
I've been thinking about moving to L.A. and joining up.
Joining up with what?
Police department.
Been on the force down here ever since I was grown.
"Hell, after 10 years of busting peeping Toms and stop sign runners,"
I'd kind of like to take a crack at the big time.
"Now I realize that getting on the force out there is no walk in the park, but, well, I figure after we wrap up this big case here, and with your recommendation..."
"Well, who knows, you know?"
I think you and me and Mackintosh can make a hell of a team.
"That's, um..."
That's an interesting idea.
Well?
"How you doing, Hurricane?"
"Hi, Larry."
"Hey Dud, this is Larry Gibson."
He's our local Smokey.
"Larry, this is Dud Cole."
He's from L.A.
How are you?
"Hi, good."
Last night some folks killed a Texas state trooper in Odessa.
"It means that Mother Kali, with all her arms outstretched... hugs us to her bosom, welcoming us back as Thugs..."
Thugs awakened from a sleep... of 50 years.
Let the neophytes and their teachers draw near.
Where are the stranglers?
Give them their strangling cloths.
Give them their burial picks.
Swear by our Mother Kali... to be thrice faithful to her and to me and to our order... and to all of us.
"Rise, our new-made brothers."
Rise and kill.
"Kill, lest you be killed yourselves."
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali.
Kill!
"It's them all right, Din, the whole blinking lot of them."
Very bad men.
The Colonel's got to know.
"You must get there, Din."
The Colonel's got to know.
The Colonel?
I run quick.
Since mighty roast beef is an Englishman's food
It accounts for the freedom that runs in his blood
For generous living Does it do all good
"Excuse me, mates."
"Oh, the roast beef of England And, oh, the old English roast beef"
"Sing us a song, will you?"
You're all under arrest.
The whole bunch of you.
"And you, too."
You know why?
Her Majesty's very touchy about having her subjects strangled.
I can't waste any more time.
Yep !
The old Gibbs is back.
GIBBS:
"You see something, Abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean, it's tragic, but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a TV set?
- It says it all.
"- Well, it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
Still got my eyebrows.
Good point.
"I found Finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he was probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
"After being underground, it's unlikely."
"Strange case, huh?"
I had this friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an NEA grant...
- Abby.
"Um, next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Nothing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
Gentlemen...
I wouldn't come too close to the door if I were you.
Have someone guard the prisoners.
"You, stay here."
"Yes, sir."
"Of all the asinine, fool-headed behavior."
You might have been killed.
For what?
For nothing.
"Well, what good is that?"
"Have a little faith, professor."
I'd prefer a hacksaw.
"I'm sorry, MacGyver, I'm afraid we're done for."
I should never have dragged you into this.
"Well, no one twisted my arm."
"No, you don't understand."
I lied.
The Academy didn't send me.
"In fact, the, uh, directors, uh, revoked my tenure."
I mean to put it simply...
I was sacked.
Who financed the expedition?
"I did, I thought that if I could find the Torch, prove Atlantis really existed, then the Academy would reinstate me."
It took all my savings to get this far.
I could barely afford the telegram I sent asking you to come.
"I hate to deceive you like that, but, uh,"
I had no other option.
"Uh, you must believe me."
"I was at the end of my rope, MacGyver."
"Oh, please understand, I mean, y-you were the only person that I could turn to."
Story of my life.
"Anyway, it's useless,"
I spend 23 hours a day wondering whether we' re wrong for each other.
Wondering whether we've got the energy that we need to get through everything that we seem to get into.
Whether the baggage we both bring would sink a small ship.
"But in the 24th hour, I realize I've been thinking about her for 23 hours."
"And I come back to, there's something about her that I can't stay away from."
Something about her that makes me wanna love her.
"Julia, my sister, read this story about a little Japanese girl who had cancer."
"And she tried to make a thousand paper cranes because she thought if she did, it would make her wish come true."
- What was her wish?
- To get better.
So how many paper cuts do you have?
A lot.
But my wish is kind of different.
What is it?
It's hard to explain.
"I kiss pretty good for a dead kid, huh?"
Not bad at all.
Cop wounded in a multi-car collision.
"BP, 124/68, pulse, 96, good sats."
"Jing-Mei, take him in."
I'll wait on the next.
- Find the guys?
- The guys opened fire.
- We have a bunch of cops hurt.
"- Mitch Palnick, 41-year-old officer."
MVA with passenger-space intrusion.
- Can't breathe.
"- Hey, nice to see you again."
- You know him?
"- He wears Florsheims, rubber-soled."
- Isn't that right?
- Correct.
"Unless Emilie has come back to life, the meeting will begin in a minute, with or without you."
- I'll contact the Ministry of Justice.
- Do that.
I was about to suggest it.
- How the hell did he get away?
- I don't know.
- They're still looking for him.
- You were right.
Emilie wasn't shot.
She wasn't there.
"They're searching his car for clues,"
- What the hell have you found then?
- Louise Hjelby's crime scene.
It seems she was picked up by her killer in a black car on her way home.
"He took her to an old boat builder's yard, where she was held captive and abused."
- Then he faked a suicide in the harbour.
- And the perpetrator found this place?
"He's trying to find whoever did it, with a notebook he's acquired."
- What notebook?
"- A bay was writing down license plates,"
The perpetrator took the book from Borch.
- The Zeuthens have just arrived.
- How did Borch get that book?
You'll have to ask Borch or Special Branch about that.
There was a reason.
I'd like to explain.
I don't want...
We've searched the dunes and the beach with a team of dogs.
- They lost the scent by the stream.
- He's on foot.
He's wounded.
They think he followed the stream inland.
"""Mr. Belfort done lost his mind."
"He done lost his mind."""
"I said, ""Does anybody else smell pancakes right now?"""
'Cause I do.
"Anytime you hear somebody say, ""Oh, Lord!"""
They are old as hell.
I'm serious.
I was watching a porno the other day.
And I didn't know how old the lady was until the dude hit the spot real good.
"He said, ""Pow!"""
"She said, ""Whoo!"
"Oh, Lord!"""
"I said, ""I ain't watching this no more."""
"""Smell like cookies and love in here."
"This remind me of Nana."""
"Oh, pfft!"
Sound like my ex-girlfriend.
¶ What my girl say.
"Now, I don't know if y'all have seen that sketch."
Yes.
"But look, if you laughed at it, you was laughing at my life, 'cause it was based off of some painful shit."
"I'm gonna be honest with you, it was about me and my ex."
"We're not together no more, know what I mean?"
"But let me tell you something, my parents have been together for 33 years."
And you don't have a 33--
And you do not have 33 years of a relationship without going through little bumps and bruises.
"And if they can't get through the bumps and bruises, forget about 'em."
"Find you somebody that's your ride-or-die, you know what I'm talking about?"
Find you somebody else.
That's got to be the yin to your yang.
The peanut butter to your jelly.
The Gayle King to your Oprah.
"So I figured someone cashes it in, you could look at the videotape."
There's our thief.
Yeah.
"Uh, could you excuse me for one moment?"
"Of course, there's no guarantee that the thief would turn it in himself."
You meeting us here is kind of a coincidence.
We were just discussing your case.
"That's a great detection idea, Howard, but I guess we feel like you've been inconvenienced enough."
"So, on behalf of the Montecito, allow me to pay you off on the bet."
- There you go.
There's eighteen hundred.
- Wow.
"And I'll just pull- 2,000."
Thanks.
I-I don't know what to say.
I will definitely recommend your hotel to everyone I know.
That's the guy I played poker with.
And our wallet thief.
And the guy who cost me 240 bucks.
Now it's personal.
Uh-oh.
Better tell the women and children to take cover.
Are you kidding me?
"Seriously, I.R.S. problems?"
Forget about it.
"The I.R.S. is like putty in my hands, honey."
"Really, no worry."
It's putty?
"Stan, what do you know about that guy Roger who played in your poker game the other night?"
"Uh, why don't you call me."
"Uh, not much, you know."
"And I'm really sorry about that whole situation, man, really."
- It was so cold.
She has a funny story about the dance.
I can't remember what it is.
"But, like, it was a dance that they used to do in 8th grade or high school or something."
No.
"You know, what she did was she went back to Tawny Kitaen's choreography in the Whitesnake video."
"- Oh, my God."
- And she copied some of the moves.
"Yeah, because in that video, basically it's Tawny Kitaen dancing on the hood of a Trans Am or something."
- I don't know what it was.
- She looks great.
I mean...
- She modified it for the Yugo.
- She did.
Look at that wind.
That wind doesn't even...
That jacket just goes the other direction.
And they had these huge heater-tunnels things that blew hot air on you.
"It's great because it's so sexy, but so hilarious at the same time."
- It's so cheesy.
- It's so Tris.
"- Cheesy dance, but she looks fantastic."
- It's so painfully cold right now.
Look how cute she is.
What were you thinking when you were watching this take after take?
"I think I was thinking I'd rather be somewhere warm and ""Does she really need me to be here for this?"""
"- Oh, my God."
- Look how cute she...
Look how just...
- She's so adorable.
"- Oh, Mike."
"It looks like there's a wind machine, it's so perfect."
"Well, I haven't slept in days."
Maybe if you just let me get some rest.
I just got kidnapped by space aliens to conduct a freaking top secret science experiment.
You know what we need.
Accelerated regrowth of your native mantle.
I understand what you're asking but come on.
He's doing the best he can.
Do better.
Liana's under a lot of pressure.
"Don't worry, once you crack this, you'll be back home, safe and sound."
What if I can't?
I won't let her harm you.
You have my word.
_
Adíos.
Allison's in a play this weekend.
- Put the meeting off a couple days.
- You know I can't do that.
Going to school events is what normal parents do.
So you're behind schedule in your research because of PTA meetings?
There is no time to waste!
We've got to get the reversion procedure working!
Mommy?
Allison.
What are you still doing up?
"It's late, honey, you should be asleep by now."
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
Fostering human tendencies only confuses her.
"- It's not fair, Ted."
- Let's get you back to bed.
"Making her think she's something she's not, it's not fair to her!"
Déjame verla.
Off your duff Hartley
"One, two."
"One, two."
"""I greatly appreciated the jar of nuts you sent,"" comma..."
"""but would you please show up for your next appointment?"""
"Just sign it, ""Sincerely yours,"" and, you can type it after lunch."
What's the matter?
"I went to Jerry's health club, and I tried to keep up with a 65-year-old woman."
Did you lose any weight?
I don't know.
I'm too sore to get up on the scale.
Ha-ha.
"Listen, Bob."
Do you want another pitcher of water before I go to lunch... or should I just run a hose in here?
"You know, Carol, being on a diet is bad enough without people making fun of it."
"I mean, you probably don't know that."
You've probably never been on a diet.
"In five minutes, I will have been on a diet for seven years."
"You looking forward to your birthday party, Bob?"
"It's not a party, Carol."
"It's, just a small dinner."
"In my case, a very small dinner."
"Oh, listen, Bob."
I wanna ask you something.
Do you think I can have an extra 15 minutes off for lunch?
I have to buy a birthday present for someone.
"Oh, sure."
Take as much time as you want and buy that somebody something real nice.
I certainly will.
"- Well, see you later."
- Right.
- You pressed the button?
Still... we did a lot of good... especially considering we're down a man.
I'm proud of you.
"Yeah, but I didn't feel like we were down a man, though, the way everybody was pitching in."
It was kind of cool.
"Didn't get Gregorio fired, either."
As far as we know.
(Lasalle laughs)
"Well, we'll finally get back up to speed once Sebastian gets through training."
In the meantime... let's take the day off.
"Now, that works for me."
(chuckles)
"Man, I can just hear that firing range calling my name."
(chuckling):
Geez.
What about you?
I think you know.
Hey.
Think we have enough for an indictment?
"I'll let you know when I get back, but I doubt it."
We are still looking for the smoking gun to directly link Garcia to NOLA businesses.
New Orleans.
New Orleans.
"You really have changed since you've been down here, haven't you?"
How so?
You seem happier... which is a good thing.
"Not for us, maybe, but for you, definitely."
Maybe... you finally have stopped running.
I think so.
"Still, what are you gonna do for work?"
NCIS slot's already filled.
I don't know.
I was thinking I'd try talking Isler into transferring me here.
Shooting people was a normal thing.
It was no big deal.
We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.
This was really a touchy thing.
Tommy had killed a made guy.
Batts was part of the Gambino crew and was considered untouchable.
"Before you could touch a made guy, you had to have a good reason."
"You had to have a sit-down, and you better get an okay or you'd be the one who got whacked."
"Saturday night was for wives, but Friday night at the Copa was always for the girlfriends."
"And last week we saw Sammy Davis, Jr."
You got to see this show.
What a performer!
He does these impersonations.
"I swear, you'd think it was the real people!"
"Oh, it's unbelievable."
You could see how a white girl could fall for him.
What?
Not me.
But you could see how some girls could.
Like that Swedish girl.
In other words you condone that stuff?
Take it easy.
I just wanna make sure I don't wind up kissing fuckin' Nat King Cole over here.
I don't mean me.
"But, you know, he's got personality."
"""Personality?"""
He's very talented.
I understand perfectly what you're saying.
But you have to watch out sometimes how you say things.
"You know, people get the wrong impression."
I just said he was talented.
Why don't you just leave it alone now?
For your signature.
"Yes, the pipeline deal."
"Well, I'll just have to look these over and then I'll sign them."
So you and Claudia got married.
Blake doesn't approve.
I hope you do.
"Oh, there's bound to be friction between you and your brother."
I feel no animosity toward Steven.
"If there are any problems, they won't be of my making."
"Adam, I want you to make this marriage work."
"And if that sounds like an order, it is."
Steven.
I heard you were here.
I thought you might like these copies I had made.
What are they?
Papers on the pipeline deal.
Mother signed them a little while ago.
Thanks.
"What else brings you here, Adam?"
Frankly?
"Something's been bothering me, Steven."
"A lack in you, let's say."
What kind of a lack?
You've never congratulated me on my marriage to Claudia.
What's the matter?
Don't you approve?
It's not for me to approve or disapprove.
"Well, surely, you must have some opinions, Steven."
"I mean, you did abandon Claudia to run off with your boyfriend."
"His name was Luke, and he's dead."
And I don't want you to talk to me about him with anything but respect.
You understand?
Why don't you ask me to come to your place?
I'm asking myself the same.
I can assure you I'm not calling for nothing.
Then put me with the asylum's principal.
"Alright, with the housemother then."
Good evening.
I was trying to explain to the other Mrs. the matter of my call.
"But apparently, there's a strong discipline in not letting an adult lady, who's there by her own will, answer the phone."
I'm not trying to teach you anything.
But...
I don't see the necessity in imposing...
military rules to some peaceful old people.
The problem is this:
It turns out that Jacoba... left home leaving a note in which she wrote me where she was going.
Without any apparent reason.
Please note that I'm disconcerted.
Jacoba's been at home for more than 40 years.
I don't know.
I can't remember her last name.
Good morning.
Did you make all this by yourself?
Of course.
And where did you get the jam and the toasts?
Everything was in the house.
And the cups?
They're yours.
Where were they?
There.
They'd only be used for special occasions.
"Like today, for example."
"God, they're tasty."
Don't laugh.
Let's get out of here.
We're gonna draw a crowd.
Just don't lie there.
Get 'em!
Wait.
Higgins.
Wait.
Easy.
Better?
A little trick I learned in Shanghai just after the war... from a sturdy little Oriental chap who demonstrated using dogs.
"Actually, it's still pretty bad."
I think I may be out of action for several days.
- No swimming with this.
- Perhaps a little acupuncture.
Let me just get my needles and we'll try some simple muscle testing.
"On the other hand, activity could be good for circulation."
Let's go back to the guesthouse.
"I'll give you hot packs, alternating with cold packs."
No.
Not so fast.
Aren't you forgetting something?
- You mean?
"- Yes, as a matter of fact."
The Hardy Boys out there.
Especially the one with Roger's teeth.
I was just gonna tell you about that.
You were just so busy with beauty and pain that it slipped your mind.
Roger doesn't have any gold teeth.
"Well, these two guys came to see me in Bayonne about six weeks ago."
Looking for Roger.
What story did they give you?
Even at the exercise salon it sounded phony.
Too busy for personal hygiene?
"When I am focused, I am focused."
"You know, McGee like them gamey, but I'm not sure he'd go for this one."
"Oh, I clean up nice."
Why don't you put the computer down and step out here?
"Let's go, Animal Kingdom."
Come on.
"So, who are you working with?"
"Ah, um..."
I don't know.
"Well, we know some stuff about the blackmail and about the AUTEC account."
We also know that you're in cahoots with someone inside Wickes Steel.
Um...
Did you just use the word cahoots?
I did.
Nice.
"All right, somebody hired me, through Wickes, but, uh, I don't have a name."
Didn't want one.
Was it Ridgeway?
Did you kill him?
I don't kill people.
I hack.
I haven't really left the van.
No kidding.
"Next time, hacker, why don't you crack a window?"
This is all of Baylor's computer hardware.
No sign of the rifle used to shoot Ridgeway in her van or in the apartment.
"Abby, you do know that AUTEC is just a facility where they run tests, right?"
"No, Tim, it is a potluck of the unexplained, and this scientist is eating it up; you know why?"
Because there's a lot of really important things that can't be explained.
"Like what, Abbs?"
Like Atlantis.
"German, American, everything."
Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."
"You have to pay attention to women, talk to them, be thoughtful occasionally."
Caress them.
"Remember they exist, they're alive and they matter to us."
That's the only therapy.
I know from experience.
What experience have you had with women?
"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.
I lived 20 years day and night with one and 4 years with this one.
I love the bullfighter's boyfriend.
I bet you anything he's well hung.
How do you know?
Did you see him?
"Okay, I'm pretty sure it wasn't that bad, but this is how Uncle Marshall likes to tell the story."
"Oh, yeah, no, that's the cuff."
"I'm woozy, and I can't flex my fingers and the rotten fish smell is getting stronger."
But I'm learning to compensate with my left.
Is that why last night when I asked you to honka honka me you only honka'd me?
I didn't think you noticed.
Snap's been jealous of Crackle all day.
Just take the cuff off.
"No, but, baby, then all the sex will stop."
"Marshall, you don't need a cuff for me to find you sexy."
"All you have to do is smile, and I'm ready for you to hop on Pop."
"Thanks, baby."
Are you too woozy to do it one last time before we seek emergency medical attention?
Only one way to find out.
Mm.
"I'm sorry, bro, I totally overreacted."
You think?
I can't believe you're allowed to ship a dead possum.
He died?
That possum was supposed to be an olive branch.
Are you sure he's not just playing dead?
He smells like Marshall's hand.
"And wait, you-you forgive me?"
Absolutely.
"Hey, I got a couple ""cee-gars."""
Get over here!
All right.
"So, where are those ""cee-gars""?"
"Eh, we'll break 'em out in a minute."
"Hey, Barn."
Ted?
"Barney, what is your sister doing here?"
And Norah doesn't despise Tris.
We spend a lot of time trying to define the relationship between the three girls.
"Because that idea of, like, ""frienemyship"" is hard."
"And so there's like a lot of debates, like, figuring out how mean they were to each other versus how friendly they were versus how passive-aggressive."
There was a lot to figure out.
And I...
Here we go.
Here it is.
- Here it is.
Here it is.
"- Michael, you stop doing that."
"Wait, watch for it."
There was no cut when we did this.
"- Okay, I'm gonna call my boyfriend."
- This is the gum.
- It looks fake.
- It looks fake.
- It looks like a skillful editing trick.
- Like someone passed me a new...
- No.
"- No, that's dirty gum."
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
- That is tainted gum.
- It's all spitty and...
"And, also, I should point out that I think Alexis and myself and Ari decided that we had all been friends since babyhood, basically."
- That's why we all tolerate each other.
- Right.
I figured that about me and Raf and Aaron too.
- We all grew up together.
- Stop trying to copy our ideas.
"No, it's the same with us."
What will this sister of mine do with rice?
But my father hath made her mistress of the feast.
- Ou!
"- Oh, help me!"
Help me!
"lam robbed, sir, and beaten."
"Lend me thy hand, I'll help thee."
"Oh, good sir, tenderly."
- Oh!
- How now!
Can'st stand?
Dost lack any money?
I have a little money for thee.
"No, good sweet sir, offer me no money, I pray you"
- That kills my heart.
- Then fare thee well.
I must go and buy spices for our sheep-shearing.
"Prosper you, sweet sir, I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too."
"♪ Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way"
♪ And merrily hent the stile-a
♪ A merry heart goes all the day
♪ Your sad tires in a mile-a ♪
"Reverend sirs, for you there's rosemary and me."
Grace and remembrance be to you berth and welcome to our sheep-shearing.
"Come, a dance, I pray"
"Your hand, my Perdita."
This is the prettiest lowborn lass that ever ran on green-sward.
"Good sooth, she is the queen of curds and cream."
"Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter?"
They call him Doricles
"He says he loves my daughter, I think so too"
I think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best.
- I just want that to be known.
- You did.
You did.
"Okay, this is sexy."
This was the original beginning of the movie.
Right.
This is how the movie was gonna start before we shot...
"Yeah, this was the opening scene."
- Look at Rafi go.
- People went bananas for Rafi.
That's really Rafi's voice too.
That's him singing.
"Although, we're not playing those instruments."
He is the only one who's really doing it.
I'm playing an instrument.
- The love instrument.
- Your body is your instrument as an actress.
"When we rehearsed this scene, before we started shooting it in Don Hill's and we were listening to that song, it was one of the most exciting moments of all..."
"People love this song and they would, like, sing it between shooting it."
This was the first few days of shooting in here.
- Why isn't this on the soundtrack?
- This was the first week of shooting.
- We were all strangers.
- It's not on the soundtrack?
It's on iTunes.
I'm gonna buy it.
"So, what are you talking about, Pete, with the stars in the sky or something?"
"Well, in the title design, they drew little squiggles and stuff in the sky."
"I was waiting for it to happen, it already happened."
"If you squint really hard and do like this, you can see."
- Okay.
- It's similar.
I'd be packing in no time.
No time at all.
That's very clearly stated.
"So, what do the rest of you think about what he just said?"
Should people take the law into their own hands like that?
"I mean, is that the answer?"
Does that solve anything?
Anyone?
Angela?
Angela?
And right before the gun went off...
I was thinking about how much I wanted that soda.
is that weird?
"Like, why did I leave it there in the first place?"
And what if I had gotten up to go get it right at that moment?
"Oh, my God. I think I better change my locker."
Like what happens when you don't sleep.
Like I haven't slept since it happened and keeps coming back to me...
just keeps coming back.
What was that?
I just keep going over and over in my mind.
Like all my friends and they go by the locker all the time...
"and it's just, not even me."
"If someone just had been going by there, and gotten shot."
"It's hard, isn't it?"
"You don't think I could get a few days off, do you?"
You are here again because I wanted to hear your story...
and Detective Martinson wanted to hear it too.
I really don't have anything else to tell.
M r.
"Krakow, can I tell you something?"
This is a good school.
They were not permitted to marry.
- On what grounds?
- Eliza was poor.
"She was flung out of the house, and he was packed off to the army."
I think he'd have done himself harm if not for John.
- What became of the lady?
- She was passed from man to man.
She disappeared from good society.
When Brandon returned from India he searched and searched. -
- Only to find her dying in a poorhouse.
I thought my daughter Charlotte might have cheered him up.
Look at him now!
So attentive!
- I should try a little experiment.
- Please.
Let the colonel alone.
All suitors need a little help.
- We haven't heard you play of late.
- You have a superior musician here.
Brandon shares your passion for music.
He plays the pianoforte well.
You know as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne.
You must play us a duet.
Let us see you both side by side.
I do not know any duets.
"Forgive me, Colonel."
Will we never have peace?
The rent is low.
But it comes on hard terms.
Mrs. Jennings has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's daughters.
There's a parcel arrived.
Look!
- No.
I don't think so.
Did he know Diane?
"- He says no, but I think yes."
Are we gonna see him?
No.
How 'bout a piano player called Tickler?
"Well, I remember somebody at the club who played piano, but I don't recall his name."
"You know, Mr. Caine, it sounds like you didn't know anybody there, and nobody there knew you except Diane."
It was a long time ago.
I told you the club wasn't one of my hangouts.
I met Diane at the beach.
"Sure, I knew people, but I don't remember their names, even their faces."
"Look, there's only one person I am interested in meeting, and that's Diane."
"Now, if you haven't found her, where are you taking me?"
To jar your memory.
?
[ Radio:
Distant ]
[ Engine Shuts Off]
- Why'd you bring me here?
- Last place you saw Diane was here.
"No, no."
The last time I saw Diane was on the dock.
I told you that.
"You know, Magnum, you keep testing me, and I don't like it."
And you're not telling me everything you know.
"Come on, Mr. Caine."
It's tough enough finding a woman who disappeared 40 years ago without my own client sandbagging me.
"Magnum, there is nothing more I can tell you that'll help you find Diane."
Nothing.
You just have to believe me.
Look at her.
"Does she look innocent to you, of anything?"
Put your head back.
Put this on.
Better.
Let's go.
Self surreender
Are you entering a plea today?
Excuse us.
We're coming through.
Thank you.
We're here to stop an injustice.
"Yes, she had to defend herself--"
With this--The knife.
She has nothing to hide.
She asked us to turn this knife over
Because she wants the truth to get out.
"The bastard spins on my show,"
Then doesn't even give me an exclusive.
He's gonna pay for this.
She defended herself against a violent man.
"She deserves a medal, not a murder charge."
We will not let her be victimized
By the justice system.
That's it!
"The ""hollywood hooker homicide"" heats up."
Sources say she was a high-Priced prostitute
Who stabbed stein to death and picked his wallet clean.
The d.A.'S story is that ann is a prostitute
Who killed stein for the money in his wallet.
"Now the wallet was empty, but her prints weren't on it."
Now the d.A. Is going to say that she is lying
"Fortunately, the producers are two of my oldest and dearest friends."
"And, uh, ahem, I may be able to persuade the boys to part with a small piece of the show."
"Mind you, I said I might be able to."
"Chop's coming right along, my dear?"
"- Yes, in a moment, father."
"- Uh, may I?"
"- Thanks, I think I can manage."
- Ah..
"Charming girl, your daughter."
Nice of you to go to all this trouble for me.
"Oh, anything to make you happy."
(Tyler) 'It's a special ambition of mine to feature you' 'in my first production.
Or did I tell you.'
"(Patricia) 'Yes, I think you did.'"
"Sorry, I'm already rehearsing in a play."
- What kind of a play?
"- A musical called Hooray For Love, if you must know."
"Ooh, Hooray For Love."
Good show?
"(Patricia) 'Surely not as good as the one you'll produce, but it'll do.'"
"Huh, hot."
"Careful, not too much salt."
- You don't like salt?
- Hate salt.
You forgot this little corner over here.
Thank you.
"Tell me, uh, is the young one mine?"
How did you guess?
"Mr. Ganz, do you recall telling me the other afternoon when my daughter was rehearsing that you could use some additional money?"
"Whether you like it or not, you'll be in my fall production."
- Bet you my high head I won't.
- It's a bet.
-Jeannie drinks.
-Maybe she's depressed.
Give me a break.
She's drunk.
"As soon as something happens, you automatically make them out to be saints."
They had bad skin and wore too much makeup.
They didn't look very good.
They looked beat-up.
And the stuff they wore was thrown together and cheap.
A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.
She spends her life in a nightgown.
"The woman is no angel, believe me."
They talked about their rotten kids were and about beating them with broom handles and leather belts.
But that their kids still didn't pay any attention.
"When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy."
I don't know if I could live like that!
"God forbid, what would happen if you had to go to prison?"
Karen...
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband--
Do you know why Jeannie's husband went to the can?
"Because he wanted to get away from her, that's why."
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.
Unless they make themselves get caught.
They don't have things organized.
I know what I'm doing.
You know who goes to jail?
Nigger stickup men.
Know why they get caught?
"Because they fall asleep in the getaway car, Karen."
"Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie."
Come here.
"It's not like that, Nate."
"Look, I know you and I haven't talked very much."
And I'm sorry about that.
But that's just fall out from your dad and me.
"I know you're going through some tough times so, if you need anything..."
"Well, let me ask you something."
"You played basketball in high school, right?"
- Only for a little while.
- You didn't enjoy it?
What are you kidding me?
I loved it!
But there was no pressure then.
And then I didn't love it so much anymore.
Your dad came up and just made everything a competition.
So then you just walked away?
Only looked back at the cheerleaders.
"It's just a game, Nate."
Not a life.
Hey spirit girl.
That cheerleading thing always throws me off.
What?
Just the more I get to know you the harder it is to wrap my head around it.
My mom used to cheer and Brooke and I have been cheering together forever so it's just kind of our thing.
- Oh cool.
- What's up?
"So, um, I need some advice."
About Nathan.
I don't know if its crossing a line.
"Okay, funny wasn't what I was going for but.."
I was the queen of boyfriend-dysfunction and now I guess
"I'm everybody's go-to on relationship advice its just kind of bizarre, right?"
If it's too weird then...
- (farmers):
Ready!
I say we shoot whatever it is and ask the questions after!
- (farmers cheering)
- You pull a stunt like that and it'd be murder.
"I'll personally see to it that you all bloody hang for it, no matter who pulls the trigger."
She killed a man and won't get away with it as long as I'm standing.
"Night will fall soon, that's when she's likely to move."
Ready the torches!
"You'll not be readying anything until I say so, got it?"
Right then.
Each of you will pair up with a constable.
"Crabtree, you talk to that farmer."
"You, stick with me!"
♪♪♪ (indistinct chatter)
- Keep your eyes open!
- Yes.
Do you see that trail?
"Ah, George, there you are!"
- Sir.
- I need you to come with me.
"The girl, Fen, she's likely to flee from the light of the torches."
"But then, sir, how will we see?"
- With these.
- Good gracious!
"Now, George, if you were trying to get away, which direction would you be likely to go in?"
"- Sir, I would follow the river."
- Exactly.
(door closing)
So you have something?
Not yet.
I need more information on Roland.
"We shall see you at Barton Park, I hope."
Next time Sir John gives one of his hops. (CHUCKLES)
"Allow me to escort you to the carriage, Mrs Dashwood."
"Thank you, Colonel."
Marianne is still rather weak.
"And Miss Marianne, of course."
Your mother's as good a hand at that game as I am.
(LAUGHS)
"Thank you, Colonel Brandon."
"I wish you a good journey, ladies."
"Dear Colonel, thank you for your kindness."
"How good it is to see the sun, after what Shakespeare calls the furious winter's rages."
"Oh, my little love."
We shall always be grateful to the people at Cleveland.
Mr Palmer's library is full of great books.
I wonder if he has ever read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare.
I should think he bought them to make a fine show.
I have formed a plan.
I shall enter upon a course of serious study.
I shall rise at six and divide every moment until dinner between music and reading.
I dare say Colonel Brandon will advise me as to my reading.
"Yes, I'm sure he will."
I long to sit down at my own dear pianoforte.
My plan shall keep me busy.
We shall have no time for regrets.
(PIANO PLAYING)
It is over now.
"Elinor, do not grieve, that moment had to come."
I'm glad it is over.
- Is it?
- At least we are talking about him.
- We should have done so before.
The legend is beautiful.
That ship is also very amazing.
"I can go in there, right?"
But how come this ship is here like this?
Because it's bewitched.
"If you become bewitched to a beautiful place, you become like this."
Have you ever been bewitched?
"Of course, I have."
I think you know.
"♬ When I look at you, everything stops ♬"
♬ I'm not sure when it started ♬
"Now that I think about it, I still haven't heard your response."
Have you been well?
Are you still sexy in the surgery room?
I think you misunderstood.
I didn't come here to do the volunteer work with good intention.
A higher up dragged me down for a little bit.
The place he sent me to was here.
"And now, I don't do surgeries anymore."
Looks like I didn't have enough skills for surgeries.
I will go back soon.
I will have to go back to the place I was in after I go back.
I am very busy.
I see.

"When you come to a place like this, you eat like this."
You will have the memory of this taste forever.
Give me your torch.
Snakes.
Why did it have to be snakes?
Asps.
Very dangerous.
You go first.
"If you're trying to escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction, so please, eat something."
I must apologize for their treatment of you.
Yeah.
Whose idea was it?
"No food, no water."
What kind of people are these friends of yours?
"At this particular time and place, to do my work, they are necessary evils."
They're not my friends.
"However, with the right connections, even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilized."
It's beautiful.
I would very much like to see you in it.
I'll bet you would.
All right.
What do you got to drink around here?
We don't have much time.
"Soon they will come to harm you,"
"Soon they will come to harm you, and I will not be able to stop them, unless you are able to give me something to placate them."
"Some, uh, piece of information... which I can use to protect you from them."
I've already told you everything I know.
I have no loyalty to Jones.
He's brought me nothing but trouble.
"Marion, you are beautiful."
I don't think we need a chaperone.
Steadily.
Steadily.
Whoa!
You understand?
And and...
what elss?
"See this i have changed them, they were very old, i have spend the money."
See more carefully.
"You sold this car with lot of effect, and she was saying no."
"That's why Chandni made her unconscious, yeah Chandni?"
Yeah... yeah... if you were hitting her then why you were behind me?
Dad please think one more time.
"That's what i am thinking, we should leave its getting late."

"Get some water madam is going unconscious, lets run with the car, this diamond is mine because this car is in my showroom."
Diamond is mine because the car is mine.
This diamond is four of us.
But what if Laxmi Narayan came to pick up the car then?
"Then we will sale him the car, what?"
But before that we will take out the diamond.
"You, never listen to me ever."
"Laxmi Narayan Jee i am Laila speaking, yeah?"
Can you come after one hour?
After one hour?
Actually papers will talk little time.
"All right, you know my nature right?"
I will come after one hour.
Quick.
Here it is...
don't be questioner... never questioner when someone is about to begin some work.
"Let's have coffee, coffee?"
Where will you hang around with this lets put it in locker.
Will it be safe in locker?

Now let's go get some ice cream.
Well...
Just in a minute.
"Hey, Street, here comes your best friend."
"Oh, that's funny."
Somebody's got to talk to him.
"Low man on the totem pole, that would be you."
Hi there.
Interested in a Malibu.
"Afternoon, Gerald."
"Oh, hey."
How you doing today?
All right.
Just came to have a second look.
Yeah.
"Can I ask you something, Gerald?"
Yeah.
What's the problem exactly?
Sorry?
Why won't you let yourself have this car?
What do you mean?
What is it really?
Is it that you think if you buy this car you're gonna find another car you like better elsewhere immediately after buying it?
Or is it that you just think you don't deserve the car?
"Man, you don't know me."
"No, Gerald."
"Please, I'm not insulting you, so please don't take it like that, okay?"
I'm just trying to understand you.
"Because all these salespeople around here, take a look at them."
They sent me over here because they've given up on you.
All right?
"They sent me, wheelchair guy, rookie, low man on the totem pole to talk to you because none of them believe that you can pull the trigger on actually purchasing a vehicle."
"Neil, tonight, Victor..."
I'm sorry.
It's not over yet.
I'm exhausted.
"Oh, thank God."
"Me, too."
"Hey, we never stopped at the cash machine."
That's right.
I still owe you a lot of money.
"Well, maybe you'll find some other way to pay me."
I'll see what I can come up with.
Whew.
"I like these parties, but they are a lot of work."
May I help you?
Hi.
I'm sorry to show up like this.
"- You're Adriana, right?"
- Yes.
"I'm Anika Truman, Grace Truman's daughter."
"Yes, of course."
I thought you looked familiar.
"I know she did some work for you a while ago, and she showed me the drawings of your house, and I'm just passing through town, uh..."
Of course.
Would you like to come inside?
Maybe you'd like a cup of tea.
- I'd love some tea.
- All right.

"All right, bitches, all set outside."
Let's wrap it up in here and go hit the strip club.
"- Yeah, baby."
"- Oh, my god."
"Franco, we just did a full tour in the firehouse."
"We had 5 fires in 2 days, and now you're talking about tits and ass?"
That's all you can talk about?

"Um, actually, yes."
"Not to mention, scores serves sandwiches till closing time."
- Really?
"- Yeah, really."
"All right, let's hurry up and get over there."

"Yo, yo, yo, bro."
"We're closed, man."

"Yeah, between the hours of 10:00 and 3:30, ok?"
Some come back tomorrow.
Ok.Sorry.
"Goddamn.Guys, I'm gonna need somebody else on the door if black shawn ain't coming back, ok."
"You know, got to get somebody to work for him tomorrow down at the firehouse."
"So, wait, he's still not back at work?"
Nobody knows where he is?
I got a message from him saying he's up in boston.
I know he's got a cousin in the department up there.
He hasn't called colleen.
She's out of her mind.
"You know something, if we keep covering for him like this, needles finds out, asshole mode he's in, trouble in river city."
"I hope he's not pulling this disappearing act because, you know, he knows I found out about what went on with him and colleen."
What?
I think so.
It's alright.
Shh!
"See, Fen?"
No harm done.
Huh?
I wasn't hurt.
"- Fen was helping, I know."
- Pa.
Pa.
"It's alright, girl."
It's alright now.
Fen stabbed Hugo de Jaager.
She was trying to protect Mr. Travis.
You caught your murderer.
"Makes you happy, does it?"
You're going to advocate for Fen to remain at the asylum.
Yes... though I can hardly argue that she wasn't in her right mind when she stabbed Mr. de Jaager.
"She was attacking a man she thought was harming her father, a perfectly rational action."
"But she didn't have men's rea, a guilty mind, so I have considerable leeway."
Can she be helped?
I don't know.
"But with further attention and care, she may be able to learn to control her wildness."
And become civilized.
(Julia sighs.)
"Given the behaviour of some of the so-called civilized people we encounter in our work, I wonder what we'd be teaching her."
"Well, she did show us that she's capable of empathy, Julia, by attempting to protect Mr. Travis the way she did."
It is the hallmark of humanity.
"No matter what we may think of him as a man, she saw him as her father."
"William, there's something I have to tell you."
(Julia sighs.)
"You have to look your best, little man."
You're gonna be vice president.
- You'll talk about legitimate issues of concern.
- Right.
Where is the senator's monitor?
There is no monitor for her.
She'll hear Pete in the earpiece.
That is a piece of shit.
"We talked about this, Ray."
"If Peter's gonna be able to see her, she has to be able to see him."
- He's got a sensory advantage over her.
- You wanna pull her?
I'm not talking about pulling her.
I'm just saying it's bullshit.
She was just great in the hearings today.
Cool and collected.
- Steve Poullet.
- Hi.
Should I hear anything?
"Oh, I got it."
"Okay, great."
"Oh, it's that one."
"Yeah, I know."
Can't hear...
"Yeah, right, got it."
"Okay, I've got the intro now."
"Thank you for having me, Peter."
"Sure, that'd be fine."
"Well, it has been a taxing experience... but if we're forced to take the voters out of the equation..."
I think that the vetting system by simple necessity must be arduous.
Mmm.
"I have to plead motherhood on that one, Pete... but I not only served on the Foreign Relations Committee..."
"I sponsored the Hanson-Fineman Bill which readjusted the War Powers Act... to allow the executive to respond to state-sponsored terrorism... like that of Iraq, Libya, North Korea, for instance."
"Actually, I wasn't alone."
Sergeant Hutchinson here served as my foil.
"- Well, thank you, Doc."
- Don't mention it.
"One day, you'll be proud to announce that you had the honor... of observing the great Dr. Winchester."
Anything I should know from here on out?
- Ask the expert.
- Just keep a close watch.
"If there's infection, the tantalum acts as a foreign body... and you have to remove it."
"If you'll excuse me, I have to sweep out the lab."

- ## [Stops]
- That's enough from the hurt parade.
"As long as the ""Harbor Lights"" are on, you're never gonna see things clearly."
"Oh, I see things very clearly."
That's why I'm writing Gus.
"""Dear Scum."""
I figured I'd start slow and then really let him have it.
Gus knew I still loved Laverne.
I told him that when I wrote him.
I don't understand something.
If all this happened because you wrote Gus in the first place... how were you gonna make things better by writing Gus in the second place?
What do you want from me?
I can't just sit and wallow in self-pity.
"Oh, Laverne!"
Laverne!
"Klinger, listen to me."
"You're yelling at him, but you're crying for her."
"If you wanna communicate with Laverne, why don't you write Laverne?"
- Hey.
"All we have to do is to get you a real show tonight, then Eddie can crawl around surreptitiously, change the audience's watches back to the time you blagged the store."
"Yes, yes, I know just the venue."
'Très chic.
Très bona.
"'Yeah, only the nicest young ladies need apply. '"
"A peepshow, Filthy?"
What if Tarby finds out?
I'll be thrown out of the Royal Order of the Charitable Self-Publicising Showbiz Bog Otters.
Don't worry about the Bog Otters.
They were in here themselves half an hour ago.
They had to leave cos they run out of 50p's.
How's my boy Richie doing?
"That audience are getting a bit restive at the moment, trying to see if bouncers really do bounce."
Don't mither the act.
"He's got enough to concern him, what with being crap."
You were supposed to be changing the audience's watches while they ogled the girlies.
I was trying to but the hands are moving too quickly.
Get on with it.
"Right, that's it."
"Richie, you're on."
"God, I'm not ready."
"How do I look, darling?"
"Not good, daughter."
"Très, très bollocks."
- He's absolutely bloody right.
- Philistines.
I'd better do my superstitions.
What are you doing?
"Titch ""Oo-er, madam, don't start me off"" Juicy always did this before a show."
- But he was notoriously awful.
"- God, you're right."
"Boys and girls, lads and lasses, please welcome to the stage a very funny man indeed, the world famous Mr, er..."
Those are exactly the same pictures.
Come to think of it... you sure do look like Suzukichi.
You are like two peas in a pod.
That's really something!
- Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
- Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes glares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, let's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'll devote himself to flirting with Clark's daughter.
Will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
Emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
Where are you going?
- Carlos:
Out.
- But--
"Carlos, wait!"
What's up with you?
"I'll catch you tomorrow, all right?"
If you told me a month ago
"I'd be running my pop's bodega, I'd say you were smoking crack."
If you had told me when we were in high school that I'd be the super of our building...
I'd told you that you were having some kind of psychotic episode.
"That shit is not even funny, man."
And you know what the thing of it is?
- What?
- I'm a pretty good super.
"Don't take this the wrong way, but it ain't that hard, man."
"It can be hard, you dumb fuck!"
"You've got to have all sorts of different management skills, you've got to know how to deal with all sorts of different people, you got to know your accounting, and I recycle."

"- Oh, shit!"
- My ball!

Come here.
"- Oh, thank you."
Carlos:
"Oh, you stupid fucker!"
"On weekends, me and Daisy got this thing, where she calls me-- to fix stuff in her apartment, and I go up, and we have sex."
I don't like to make things about me.
"You know, people think of me as a giving person."
"Oh, I can't take it."
I'm blowing the lid off this web of lies.
"I'm gonna ""Brady Bunch"" her."
You know I wasn't allowed to watch television as a child.
"Well, this man blamed Carol for injuring his neck in a car accident, and then Mike and the kids went to court, and then Mike dropped a briefcase, which caused the man with the fake neck brace"
"to whip his head around, proving that his neck wasn't hurt at all."
The whole family went to court for a traffic accident?
"The doctor was supposed to be examining my neck,"
- but his eyes were journeying.
- It's quite a journey.
"Mama, I can't find my ball."
Try to find anything else to squeeze.
"You know, I had him on a flight once to JFK."
No!
He kept on pressing the help button.
It was supposedly because he didn't know how to work the...
Damn it!
"I thought you said the ""Brady Bunch"" man dropped his briefcase, not his husband's spaghetti plate!"
Mom!
You okay?
"Oh, she's fine."

Isn't it about time that somebody put this kid on medication?
They stick his hand in this weird --
"I don't know, contraption and, while he's going through it, he's explaining to us that, like,"
"""oh!"
"It's taking a tissue sample."""
Ow!
And extrapolated it.
Some kind of accelerator?
Agh!
Are you all right?
I don't know.
"That's just -- and then, all of a sudden, this, like, gorgeous 16-year-old girl walks out of this unit and he's like"
"""Oh!"
"That's my daughter."""
Arm yourself.
Where did she come from?
From me.
From you?
How?
Who is she?
"Well, she's -- well..."
She's my daughter.
"Hello, Dad."
"They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples from other people, which is weird."
"Now he's a father, which is a great way to have a kid."
"All those years, he didn't have to not sleep because the kid was up, crying, or having to go to school because of chickenpox."
"Hello, Dad."
"In the same way that Jenny came out of nowhere, at the end of the episode, she kind of awesomely goes into nowhere."
It's very sad.
The Doctor gets a clone and so then there's another Time Lord and you think about the potential for adventures and everything that he could've taught her and shown her and then it's snatched away so quickly.
"Jenny, be strong, now."
You need to hold on.
Do you hear me?
"Oh, yes."
No.
"Yeah, probably, I am."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Well... it was a great two-and-a-half dates.
And I'd be willing to round it up to three if you want to.
I don't think so.
"I hope you're sure about this, because once I leave, I'm not coming back."
Unless you want me to.
"Bye, New Christine."
Bye.
That is one hot grandpa.
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
"I see, you are the Makoto of the Bake Neko!"
Please tell me.
What can you achieve by talking?
What can be achieved?
That is already out of control.
"Soon, I'll be killed by that."
"To you, it doesn't matter if you survive or die, but to me, I must definitely kill it."
"In order to do that, I need you to talk."
"The one who turned it into a demon was you, and thus, you have an obligation to talk."
Obligation?
It is just a grudge filled story.
"I have wasted my life living to this age, to actually be intimidated by that..."
Final Act
"That girl, Tamaki was a sacrificial offering."
"It slowly became inevitable, as if and leaned towards me."
"Because of how things ended up, it would have been pitiful if I had taken her home."
"So, I let her wear beautiful clothes and eat delicious food."

A pity Edward has no passion for reading.
You asked him to read.
then you made him nervous.
Your behaviour is cordial.
You like him in spite of his reading.
I think him everything that is amiable and worthy.
Praise.
Indeed.
He shall have my devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother.
- What shall I do without you?
- Without me?
"I'm sure you will be very happy, but promise you won't live far away."
- There is no question of...
- Do you love him?
I do not deny that I think very highly of him.
That I greatly esteem him.
I like him.
Esteem?
Like?
Use these words again and I shall leave the room!
Believe my feelings to be stronger.
What else do you want from me?
Five minutes.
So you've been what?
Stalking me?
I just wanted to see you.
"If I wanted the best vanilla shakes, I would have gone down the street, right?"
I'm sorry...
"Look, you should know that I didn't want to put you through that test."
Ok?
"It's my family's lawyers, they insisted on it."
"I don't want your money, ok?"
I want your signature on a piece of paper.
"As soon I saw you, I knew there was no need for a DNA test."
You're my daughter.
"I know this is really, really confusing."
Ok?
"Believe me, I get it."
"But you need to understand that before I was served those papers,"
- I had no idea you even existed.
- No.
"My dad, Donald, he told me that you left after you found out Mom was pregnant."
No.
"I never should have left your mom, that's the worst thing I've ever done in my life."
But I swear I did not know she was pregnant.
I loved your mom a lot.
I brought you this.
Just read it when you have the time.
Are you going to sign the papers?
As soon as my attorneys say it's ok.
I gotta get back to work.

"Whereas now, it's all around the world."
hen we started getting ready for it we just knew that it had to be good.
think we felt lik e we had a lot to prove.
he fans have spread the word about One Direction so much that I think it might be a little bit different this time.
e never expected any of that so now there's something to live up to.
"And if we don't live up to it, then I don't know what happens next."

Now that sums it up.
"I just don't know where it goes from here, really."
It's mad.
I'm really nervous.

"Proper nervous, Iike."
So crazy.

Kozlenko's require a Class A security clearance.
"And in 1988 there were only two people, other than the operatives themselves with that kind of clearance on that specific project."
"One of them Yale, is dead."
"Oh god, what the hell is this?"
You are the one that set up agent Kozlenko.
You told the Stazi about the defection.
And you helped set the trap that killed him.
You have no proof.
"Actually sir, I do, the money."
The ten million dollars marked for Kozlenko.
Once a year the bank needs a signature to renew the account.
I checked it out.
"It was your signature, sir."
The only thing
I can't figure out is whether Jared Clayton was working for you.
Or you were working for him?
"I knew you were ambitious, Henry."
I just didn't know how ambitious.
"Security is on its way up to you, sir."
You might want to call your lawyer.
I'm not going to be calling anybody.
"Sir, you were saying?"
Sounds good.
I'll release the statement in the morning.
"You should get some sleep, agent Davis."
You sound tired.
It's been a long week.
"Yeah, yeah, I"
- I can hear him.
"Uh, yapping in the background."
Is he house broken yet?
"Mm, sorta."
"Got to keep drawing their fire, all right?"
Got it.
Give me another mag.
Where are you going?
We'll never get a clean shot from here.
I need to get up that hill and shot on the gunner.
All right.
I got your back.
All right.
Cover him!
"Rob, why eliminate witnesses?"
"I mean,whoever's tracking you, they either... want to use the bomb for themselves or... they want to keep you from using it, but... either way, wh-what difference do witnesses make?"
"I mean, the bombs have fingerprints,don't they?"
Something that make them traceable.
I remember reading that.
It's the uranium.
"It has, uh..."
It has a specific signature.
It places the origin of the device where it was made.
"So there were dozens of these things used in the attacks,right?"
And now you have the last one.
Yeah.
"Robert, I don't, I don't think these people are looking at this thing as a weapon."
It's more than that.
It's...
Evidence.
It's the smoking gun behind the greatest crime in the history of the world.
Huh.
The bomb... it could expose the people who were responsible for the attacks.
That's why they need it back.
Yeah.
Did you see what I just did?
"I'll join you in a moment, babe."
Sit down.
What the hell's the matter with you?
You know better than to talk in front of her.
The price of beef is going up too fast in New York.
They feel a congressional investigation is imminent.
"So, what do they want from me?"
A four cent drop for the next six months.
[Laughing]
"Six months, huh?"
Do you know how much that'll cost me?
"Hey, you seem like a smart, young man."
"You tell me, what am I paying' those guys down there for, anyway, huh?"
Can't they do something about it?
They are doing something about it.
They're giving you a warning that could save us a lot of aggravation.
You can't afford to be too greedy.
It's not like the old days.
"All right, all right, all right."
Work it out!
But don't you give me no crap about the old days.
"At least, in the old days, you could understand the comics."
"Today, all they got is cosmic ducks and star shit."
"Now, you get outta here."
Don't you come back until you have something I wanna hear.
"Okay, Mr. pontivini."
Whatever you say.
"- Hi, tom."
"- Hey, Ralph."
"Very good, thank you, very good."
"Listen, Ralph, uh..."
"I'm lookin' for the girls that were with those, uh, ghetto ghouls on the night they were killed."
"Six cod and chips, six haddock and chips, threepenn'orth of spare chips and a dozen pickled onions."
Come to six and threepence.
"Here's the change, Mr Twelvetrees."
"Thank you, Henry."
Did you get any crispy bits?
"Yeah, I got those for nothing cos it was such a big order."
"Cor, what a lovely smell."
Did you put salt and vinegar on?
"No, I didn't think it would be to his lordship's taste."
"You put them in the warming oven, James, I can't stand the smell."
"Am I to understand it's fancy dress tonight, sir?"
No.
We want to put the workers at their ease.
"I see, sir."
"Pour me one, George."
What on earth have you done to yourself?
Perhaps the cap is too much.
You look absurd.
What do you mean?
"There was a man digging up the road, he was dressed exactly like this."
"So I made a list, gave it to my tailor, and he sent them round."
"For God's sake, take that awful red hankie off."
Put it back on again.
- What are you doing in that get-up?
"- It was you father's idea,"
- so as not to embarrass the guests.
"- You are a silly arse,"
I simply said we won't dress for dinner.
We just looked out the window and saw three men looking at their watches.
"I don't want to worry you, but they were all wearing dinner jackets."
- (Bell)
"- Oh, my God!"
I guess you're right.
And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.
What is eating inside your heads?
You're just like beggars.
I am only going because... this man Suzujiro is my big brother.
"And mind you, I am not going to see him because he is rich."
"Everybody, come over here!"
What is it?
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just oId-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
And now... we've upset Grandma.
I feel pretty bad.
You've got to do something about it.
"Well, I guess I destroyed the mosque before we even built it."
Most of the people here probably won't even remember this.
"You know, that's... sad that that's as reassuring as it is."
"Amaar, sorry, I'm late."
What did I miss?
"You're so pretty, Rayyan."
{ Advertisement }
Can't let this get you down.
- How would you suggest I...
- Motivate it?
"Look, if we don't raise the money, we are not getting the mosque."
"And if last night is any indication, we are not raising the money."
- Do you need a bottle?
- A bottle?
"Yeah, 'cause you're acting like a baby."
"So, last night tanked, suck it up!"
You wanted a sign?
You were given one that told you to build a mosque!
You might have to do some of the heavy lifting yourself.
"- I'm sorry, was that too harsh?"
- No.
You're right.
You're absolutely right!
I can do this.
Positive attitude makes all the difference.
What if the chicken wasn't a sign?
What if I missed the real sign while I was hanging out...
- With a chicken?
- You want another sign?
Really?
That's kind of creepy.
[ amused exclamation ]
"And I was like, ""It's cool, really."
"You can call me Sheer for short if you can't get it."""
"And she looks at me and she goes,"
"""Can I just call you Jane?"""
"And I was like,"
"""If you want to give me a slave name."""
[applause]
You can't do that.
Just change someone's name for the convenience.
"Is this ""Roots""?"
Are you trying to Toby me right now?
"And every time that happens,"
"I want to get so sassy and be like,"
"""Oh, I'm sorry my name's too ethnic for you."
"""Sorry you can't fit all that heritage in your little lips."""
[cheers and applause]
"But I don't really have a right to be angry in that regard, because my name's not actually from any island or African culture."
"It's from ""Star Trek."""
My parents are Trekkies.
Technically Trekkers.
That's what the fans were called when the show first came out.
And they were watching an episode together--
"Season 2, Episode 50-- and Captain Kirk was flirting with this alien princess, as he does."
"And he gave her a rose, and she goes,"
"""Oh, we have something like this on my planet, except it's made out of crystal and it's called Sasheer."""
"And my parents were like, ""Yes!"
"That'll be our daughter."""
And they gave each other a Vulcan high five and called it a night.
Then why were you out in it the night before last?
I wasn't.
"I was here all night, Mum."
Do you know how many nights I've stood on that bridge?
"How many times I've... climbed over and stood on the parapet and... wanted to jump, wanted to end it all?"
You want the truth?
The truth is...
I'm a coward.
I'm fucking scared.
I need your help.
I need you to be there for me.
The only way I can do this is if you help me.
You said we were friends.
Mm?
Then help me to do this.
"Please, Paul."
"As my friend, all right?"

MydearestFrances  I know you're angry and hurt.
You don't want to hear anything I have to say.
I don't want you to feel bad for not speaking to me.
I don't blame you at all.
"And, of course, you're right."
I don't expect you to understand why I've done the things I've done.
I don't even understand them meself... though me pals Arthur Guinness and Jack Daniels might have an idea.
Anyway...
I need you to know it was never my intention to hurt you.
"I've been stupid, and selfish, and pig - headed."
I don't have much to show for me time...
except you.
And I couldn't ask for more.
Look after your mother.
You don't need me to tell you she's one of life's good ones.
Far too good for someone like me.
It says Robert Quinn?
"Until there is signed consent from Robert Quinn, the adoption of Callie Jacob is denied."
Told you I was gonna hit you where it hurt.
Your bones are shattered in several places.
- He's gonna need surgery.
- He's a pianist.
Our concern right now is making sure he can still use it at all.
- What are you doing up?
- Can't sleep.
You?
I remember when you used to crawl into bed with me when that happened.
"Yeah, I thought I'd, uh, spare you tonight."
Hm.
"Then you'd end up sprawled out sideways, your feet next to my head, kicking me in the face all night long."
"See, I remember it as you headbutting my feet, actually."
Really?
Then Mama would viciously attack your elbows with her ribs?
Really?
Yeah.
Sorry about that.
Sounds terrible.
Eh... it was pretty nice.
Back when that was all it took to make you feel safe.
- How's it feel?
- About the same.
Still numb?
"What if I, um  can't ever play again  like I used to?"
"Honey, don't think like that."
"You can't think like that, ok?"
"You just have to keep trying, keep at it, you know?"
"Don't you ever give up on your dream, you hear me?"
- We don't have any oranges?
All right.
Will it be fine if I just give it to you?
Then we have a deal.
A contract?
Didn't you say that you will definitely pay me back?
No need to look to know that you still want to be a driver.
Why don't you just be my driver?
I'm not that familiar with South Korea.
You can also help me run errands.
I'll pay you 25 000 Won to be my driver and also to run errands.
Two hundred times should be enough for a total of five million Won.
Two hundred times?
You don't want to?
Then don't repay me.
Why so urgent?
Where do I need to sign?
It won't be easy.
"Even if it's going to be tiring, I will not give up."
Over there.
- President?
- Now?

(Dark horse - is a term used to describe a little-known person.)
I heard that you also got an invitation from United States.
Why did you choose to come to South Korea instead?
Money?
My father has earned a lot.
He will definitely let me inherit it.
So I don't feel the need to serve the United States.
"So, you are a patriot."
"Mr. President, being under your service is a big honor, and it can't be compared to any other thing."
"In ten years, you'll be a forty year old ahjussi."
"At that point, today will appear like a faded, yellowed old photograph."
"Without even knowing it, you'll realize you've already let go."
"After that, the days will continue to build on top of each other, and you'll be like a fossil from the dinosaur age to me."
Too depressing?
"This is Lee Seo Yeon, I wasn't able to reach the quota."
"No matter how hard I tried to lengthen it, I just couldn't do anymore."
Did you send the manuscript?
I'm calling because I've been waiting.
"I sent it, you didn't receive it?"
"No, I didn't."
Where did it go off to?
Emails lately have been arriving hours later than usual.
I sent it last night around ten or eleven.
"Anyway, I definitely sent it."
It's hard to believe an email you sent last night still hasn't arrived.
"Anyway, please send it again."
"All right, I just got home, I'll send it right away."
"All right, thank you."
Yes.
I sent it.
"I sent it, I definitely sent it."
I sent it.
Welcome!
I decided to make curry today.
It's going to be amazing.
What's wrong?
What?
Be quiet.
Did you lose something you've been working on?
I said be quiet!
Why are you getting angry?
It's the flies and beetles that feast upon us.
"I'm more interested in why someone did this, Doctor."
"Then I'll have to research the predatory, manipulative, grandiose nature of this behavior."
But my first impression is that we're dealing with a complete loon.

"I have seen a lot of things selling real estate, but can you imagine walking in, seeing that?"
When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpsein the living room, if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real estate women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
Who's the owner?
A local contractor and me.
"Uh, I buy and Bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert Whitehead, the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here, you or Bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body, that's a real plus."
Jody.
I came as fast as I could.
You okay?
That's my husband I called him.
"Just  duck under the tape, Rick."
David.
What's wrong?
Alan Milliken is dead.
What?
How?
Why don't you tell me?
What do you mean?
"I told you, I didn't go there."
I know what you told me.
"You sat in your car, you made some phone calls, and you came straight here."
"Yes, and that's the truth."
Then you won't mind the police checking your cell phone and the car you used tonight.
"You know... you asked me to take care of a problem, and I did."
"If you want the police to check phone logs, then have them check yours first."
Because remember?
You called me tonight.
"I am here because of you, David."
"What happened, Sherry?"
I went over to the house just to speak to Julia.
Alan interrupted us.
There was an argument and... he had a heart attack.
There's going to be an investigation.
You're going to have to tell the truth about this.
The truth isn't going to save either one of us.
"All they're going to hear is that I was there on your behalf to prevent Alan from meddling with your presidency, and that he died from natural causes."
"Now, how do you think that's going to play out in the New York Times for the next six months?"
What did you do to Alan?
"Honestly, David,"
nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
"Kim,"
I transferred that feed to your system.
"Alright, put in an aircomms request with all the main providers."
I want a name and address as soon as possible.
"If you want my opinion, from the blood on the back of the door the attack looks like it started when she came out of the bathroom."
"Ally, you be the victim."
- Why me?
- Because you're...
"Alright, you be the victim."
"Go on, get in touch with your female side."
She should probably have a leak in the bathroom.
You don't have to do that part.
When she comes out... she gets a blow to the back of her head.
Now it's bad but doesn't kill her.
She goes on the bed.
Now she's probably out cold when the attacker comes at her again.
Are you enjoying this?
"Now, the attacker is covered in blood."
"The traces we found in the bathroom,"
I reckon he took time to wash before making his or her - equally - exit.
Where are you going?
I've just bludgeoned you to death.
Mark!
Happy birthday!
"I was just out for a run, so I, erm, I thought I'd surprise you."
- Right.
"- Life lesson there, isn't here?"
Should never turn up unannounced.
I saw him leave.
So what was Kenton doing here?
Did he stay the night?
"Laura, can you talk to me please?"
Is there any point in lying?
Why would you do that?
"We'll be on our own again, eh?"
"Well, don't forget Mr Nibbles."
Yeah.
Have you seen him this evening?
"No, but his food's gone, so hopefully that was him."
"And I cleaned up a mess in the linen cupboard, hopefully that was him."
"Oh, yes, it's good to be loved."
Good night.
"Morning, Mary."
"I just wanted to say, I hope there's going to be no hard feelings."
In fact I got you a little something just to let you know how much
I value your experience and I'm looking forward to working with you.
Thank you very much.
"I don't drink, but that can go to the cleaners."
"Well, there you go."
I just hope we can move forward and forward our nifty little team.
"Yes, professionalism above all else."
"Jenny, I need you to wee into the cup here."
What?
I just need to check you're not on heroin.
Heroin?
"Yeah, I'd give you the benefit of the doubt but there's been an accusation from a member of staff that you might have been injecting in front of the patients, so..."
"How many miles are you on these days, Len?"
1672.
Just- just outside Kiev.
Kiev?
***
Don't
"- Don't touch the chart, please!"
I'm thinking about getting myself a bike actually.
Oh!
"You know, one of those fold-outs for the commute."
- Yun-hwa!
What are you waiting for?
Come in and take a good look.
"But if you do not find the man you are looking for, there will be consequences for violating the privacy of a maiden."
"No, wait out there."
Are you satisfied?
What more do you want?
Leave this room.
How much more contempt must I tolerate?
It's bad enough that you've force yourself into a maiden's room.
Do you now wish to tear it apart?
Leave now.
I will not tolerate any more disrespect!
What are you doing here?
Lady Yun-hwa has a message for you.
For me?
You wish to go to the baron?
Do you know who you are up against?
The baron isn't your only opponent.
"Imperial Attendant Ju Tae-moon, Prime Minister Yoon Won-hyung, this could be a fight against the King who would shield them!"
One man has already lost his life.
I have no other choice.
This is the only way to save my friend's life.
They will not release him that easily no matter what you say.
"In fact, they will try to hurt you as well."
I can't back down.
You may be disqualified from the exam.
You may never get the chance to realize your cherished dream!
I know.
"Master, it's Kyun."
Enter!
Brothers...
"But, look, if you don't get ahold of Alice and get the recipe, how you gonna sell this stuff?"
- What are you gonna do?
-Very simple.
The first thing I gotta do is get some financial backing.
"Now, tomorrow when I go to work, I walk right in to Mr. Marshall."
"Mr. Marshall, the president of your bus company?"
"Why, certainly."
He's a swell guy.
"Last year, for instance, there was some guy named, uh..."
"Herman Fatrack, and he had some kind of an invention."
"It was, uh, a wrench lock."
"Well, he took it in to Marshall, showed it to Marshall,"
"Marshall liked it, gave him some money and now he's got a whole factory going for himself."
Called Fatrack's Factory.
"Not bad, not bad, Ralph."
"But have you got an idea on how to present this, uh... this, uh, stuff here to your boss?"
I don't need any idea.
I'll do the same thing we did.
I'll let him taste it.
He'll be sold on it just like we were.
"Now, soon as he puts the money in my company and Alice knows that my boss has got money in this thing, she'll be proud to give me the recipe."
"Ralph Kramden, I got to take my hat off to you."
"Now, let's see."
We got to get some kind of a name for this.
Yeah.
How about this?
Kramden's Delicious...
"Now, wait, ho."
Wait a minute.
"What do you mean, ""Kramden's Delicious...""?"
Mr. Marshall is putting up the money for this thing.
You got to get his name in there someplace.
His skull would have had to go right through the table.
The body is in the wrong position.
Was that tape torn?
I'm sure this is important.
But why?
"Because if I'm the killer and I want to get a dead body off my table,"
I'd cut the tape.
BRENNAN:
It was torn.
Which suggests Aldo tried to break free.
So perhaps he was killed somewhere else.
"They're at the sound studio, combing through the wreckage."
What's left?
"What's left is you could fit into a beer can, that's what's left."
So we're back where we started.
Who is this guy?
And why did he target Aldo Clemens?
Yeah. (phone ringing) Hold on.
(Booth groans)
(phone beeps) Yeah?
There's one possible explanation for how Aldo died.
"Well, look, does it get us any closer to finding out who killed him?"
"Well, let me show you what we have."
"All right, hold on."
What do you got?
(sighs)
BRENNAN:
"From the position of the body and the fractures, the killer couldn't have snapped Aldo's neck while he was restrained."
So what's left?
SAROYAN:
The most likely explanation is that Aldo killed himself.
"He was fastened to the table by duct tape, but he managed to loosen it."
Let me tell you that this is one of the worst days of my life.
Remember how I told you Minx's best friend was the light?
"Well, now I realise I was wrong."
Bonnie was my best friend.
Bonnie.
I saw that crystal clear today when I went to the airport to pick up her parents.
It was a good photo opportunity for Minx.
"So she went, even though it was very early."
"You didn't laugh at my little joke against Minx, Michelangelo."
Maybe you don't have a sense of humour.
"Anyway, her family are fat."
They're all fat and small.
Her little sister looks like a sausage.
Look over there.
But they loved Bonnie.
They loved her.
"Nursed her through the operations, the eyes, the nose, everything."
Worked night and day to pay for it all.
And now she's gone.
All for nothing!
The detective asks me how I feel about my models.
"I told him again and again, I adore them."
"Of course, Michelangelo!"
They wear my designs!
"OK, OK, Dorothy was, I must admit, tiring."
It was the tears like a fountain.
"And Bonnie was, I admit, a nightmare, but in the show, you see, she was a winner."
"She could walk, you see."
"And then there was the hair, red, which was, in my opinion, overrated."
"That's why I put her in a wig but not just any wig, you understand."
"A 30-metre long black braid, Chinese reference."
"It was superb, truly superb."
Bring her in.
- You know what?
It's so nice out.
Why don't we just all go for a walk?
"It's pouring rain, Ted."
I think it's pretty obvious she can't fit through the door.
"She is a gorgeous, athletic woman."
"""Athletic."" Sideburns, no cans."
- She is hot.
"- So why can't she come in, Ted?"
She can come in... in six and a half months.
Wait.
Are you saying she's...
- Twenty and a half.
- Almost.
"Hold up, guys."
She had to bounce.
Um...
Flash mob broke out in front of a line... of Korean-Mexican food trucks in Williamsburg.
The only thing that would make her more of a 20-year-old is an ironic form of transportation.
She's roller-skating there.
"Yeah, I don't know which is more pathetic..."
That you're going out with a 20-year-old... or that you bought a leather cuff to get a date with her.
I didn't buy this to get a date.
"I just happened to be out, catching up..."
- on some Saturday afternoon leather cuff shopping...
- Oh.
And she just happened to be a leather cuff saleswoman.
"God, I am so glad I am done chasing bimbos."
"Now that I'm engaged, that whole part of my life just seems sad and empty."
"I don't want this to sound too harsh, Ted, but you disgust me."
"Uh, until a month ago, your headboard had a lube dispenser."
You know why?
"'Cause the one day-- the one goddamn day that your department, that your crew, that your goddamn country needed you the most, you froze up like a goddamn needle-ass little dick."
Anybody else want some?
"You're all right, you're all right."
It's all right.
It's all right.Get up.
I wish you boys could learn to get along.
Jeez.
"When we were riding down in the rig that morning,"
I think we were figuring out what we were gonna do.
"I was ok, so was he."
"Getting off the rig, fine."
"Going in, going up, coming out, the first couple of saves, all good."
Even as the building... was coming down.
"The rumble, all instinct."
"Run, roll, cover, fine."
"But after... rubbed all that shit out of my eyes, out of my ears, couldn't see anything, couldn't hear anything."
"You never told us what to do after, did you?"
"Running up the beach on d-day, huh?"
"Guys on the left of you, the right of you getting their heads blown off."
You kept running up the beach.
Hitler's holy hell.
"We heard all about that, right?"
D-day.
The marching to berlin.
Goddamn concentration camps.
"Going in, freeing everybody up."
We heard all about that.
Goddamn hero.
Goddamn decorated hero.
What were we supposed to do after?
You never told us what you did after.
I'm the deciding authority here.
But finding the vehicle involved in the accident is also is a tough task...
Exactly.
Come with me.
"Based on the postmortem report, the impact suggests that... it's clear that the vehicle involved in the accident is a car."
There were shattered glass pieces all over.
That must be of the car's windshield.
"If it was an outsider, he couldn't have left the town without changing it."
The same applies to a local person as well.
What if it was a local person...
And he has his car hidden without changing the windshield?
"Okay, you leave."
Investigate this case in your pattern.
Or try a cookery show instead.
Don't ask for my help.
"- Sir, chill..."
I was just giving an opinion.
You are the leader of this case.
Forget about it.
Tell me about the next step.
Start the bike.
What?
I don't know to ride a bike.
I have to do that as well?
"Greetings, Sir."
Greetings.
I want all the details of windshield repairs that have been done since the 18th.
"Okay, Sir."
I'll check it.
Also I need the address of nearby workshops.
"Okay, Sir."
List of people who had changed the wind shield.
- review our options.
- Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
And you got a grand total of two.
"Option A, Brandon takes the deal."
"Option B, Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big."
"Look, look."
What about... reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon... informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if..."
God forbid...
that they decide to...
- take revenge?
- What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about ""if I talk, they'll kill me""."
"Right now, he's the only thing holding up this deal."
- Good.
"- No, that's not good."
That's terrible.
"Trust me, sir, your nephew won't last in prison two weeks."
You let him take his chances on the outside.
Maybe I can
- work in some witness protection.
"- No, look, look."
"These are vicious, desperate people."
I've been told that one of them killed another man by crushing his head with an ATM machine.
People love to take credit for the fun ones.
The guy who got his head smooshed used to be a client of mine.
"His wife killed him, all right?"
It was open and shut.
"Trust me, you folks have nothing to worry about, okay?"
"So, this kid ends up losing."
"And I go to him, and he doesn't pay me."
"Instead, he goes to the Dean, tells the Dean, and the Dean expels me."
When did this happen?
Um...3 weeks ago.
I don't know.
But there's 2 days left in winter break and I can't even go back to school.
And what about the money?
"God, I owe this guy $6,000 now, and next week it's gonna be 7."
"He says if I don't have it by the end of the week, he's gonna come to my house and take it from my mother, so..."
Let's get some lunch.
Bailiff:
All rise.
Judge:
"Having reviewed the petition briefs, and based on arguments presented,"
I hereby deny the petitioner's request for asylum.
"Your honor, may I be heard?"
"You have been heard, Mr. mooney."
There's no legal basis to grant asylum here.
The petitioner shall be returned to her home immediately upon her release from the hospital.
[Gavel bangs]
How long you been out of school?
Ahem.
I got kicked out 2 weeks before winter recess.
What have you been doing?
"Oh, you know."
"Intercepting mail, phone calls."
"Just trying to figure this whole thing out, basically."
"Well, you gotta tell your mom."
[Cell phone rings]
"That's, uh..."
That's the bookie.
!
"If they see that you've been making a detailed record of all the fancy gifts you've been going them, even a fool would know your intended use for that journal."
"You may not end up in prison, but you would lose their trust at the very least."
What?
Release the criminal who stole government property!
One of them has already died in confinement.
I fear it will hurt your esteemed name if the other one dies as well.
Add glory to your name with display of mercy.
But what if that boy starts talking and causing trouble?
Don't worry.
I will make certain that he keeps his mouth shut.
Chun-su!
Chun-su!
Thank god you're all right!
What's wrong with you?
Do you know what he did to get you out?
I don't care.
Chun-su...
What's wrong with you?
Your friend risked his...
Don't even mention him.
He's no friend of mine.
"I told you, you're wrong about him!"
"Chun-su, Baron Huh would like to see you."
Go ahead and drink it.
"Me, sir?"
I had them brew the best herbs for your injury.
It will make moving around much easier.
Sir...
A good medicine is always bitter.
Go ahead an drink it.
I apologize.
Where?
Taking Owen to our place?
"Well, I didn't want to go there."
"I don't like Owen baby, I don't want to see Owen."
What's your schedule like?
I need your help.
I cannot get to close because I'm a stranger in this country.
There are some things which are difficult to study because of that.
I watched the creature from the empire state building but at night it's closed.
How can I study the behaviour of this creature?
It's on a private property.
I don't know...
"I'd like to help you, but I don't know what you expect me to do."
I'm just a college acting teacher.
"Fuck see Owen, OK."
"I got business, I got things to do."
See fucking Owen.
"Well, listen..."
I'd like to help you in some way but...
"I've an appointment right now, can we get in touch tomorrow?"
"These aliens are killing people, you're the only person I know in New-York."
"Telephone me tomorrow, keep in touch OK?"
Almost everything you've done since you left me has been self destructive.
Adrian is a real bad influence on you.
She didn't care anything about you.
She's only using you.
You're ruining your carrer.
Your future.
What are you talking about?
"It's the only thing I care, about my carrer."
What do you thing I'm doing right now?
I'm getting ready to shoot with a fashion photographer I met at the club.
One day in his hospital in Switzerland he told people he was going to dance a solo performance.
He put up a crucifix made out of black and white cloth.
He climbed up on it like Christ.
"He wanted to tell people about war  the death, destruction, and emptiness of war."
Tomoko went home.
Without eating breakfast?
She gave this back to you.
"""Paganini"""
I haven't seen you in a while.
I saw Yagi the other day.
I got a letter saying that the place on the hill was sold.
"I was wondering what was up, so I tailed him."
He seems to be pretty worried about you.
Ha ha.
He was looking for Takehara-san everywhere.
"You didn't tell him yourself, did you?"
Of course not!
"In fact, it was I who suggested to him buy it for your studio."
I don't want to build a new studio anymore.
"In fact, I'm thinking of giving up my studio in Tokyo."
Why?
"I don't think I'm going to continue working, that's why."
"Mrs., don't make me worry like that."
"If you're worried, remember that I'm behind you all the way."
You mustn't quit like that.
I don't think Yagi likes it when I dance.
"Mrs, you need to do something about Yagi and his dreary ways."
"Mrs., go it alone!"
You need time for yourself and to get your enthusiasm back.
It's about time you got a divorce.
Get a divorce!
That would be better.
Do you want me to pull it up for you now?
Yeah
I don't think she's going to give them anything.
We're going to have to find Marcus Alvers by ourselves.
What can I do?
"Um, I followed up on some of those Asian connections, but in the meantime, there's something I want you to look at."
- It's a long shot.
- What is it?
A list of cities where Marcus Alvers has been in the last three years.
Each time only for a couple of days.
Maybe he was meeting somebody.
Cross it with the other suspects in our database.
"Let me know what you come up with, okay?"
Okay.
"Look, I don't know why we have to go through this again."
I already answered that.
"What is it, Edmunds?"
Just wanted to give you an update on Nina.
"Rae, could you pause that?"
She give us anything new on Alvers?
"No, other than the probability she knew him personally."
She's not cooperating.
What are we doing?
Richards is working on her now.
I think that's a mistake.
Why?
"/I don't think anybody should be in there that hasn't worked with her before, doesn't know what she's capable of."
She'll manipulate him.
All Richards does is inflict pain.
There's no way for her to manipulate him.
All right.
"How much more of this you want to endure, Nina?"
"I just heard some sounds, like animals, and was..."
"Oh, call it natural curiosity."
"That's what got me into this business, I guess."
I'm just naturally curious.
"Well, I assure you, there is nothing here"
Nor any place else on my property that could
Interest you in the slightest.
I realize it's been difficult for you
With all that's happened.
Look here.
I don't like to see anyone die.
But I didn't know this Jeff boy at all.
Were he and your niece engaged?
Not really.
There wasn't a ring or anything.
Did he stay at her house?
He had his own apartment.
Suppose she stayed with them?
That would hardly be the behavior
I'd expect from my niece.
Check up on her very often?
Lord no.
"Since her mother's death, I've look in on her"
Once in a while just to see if I could help.
"Ms. Ramsey, this is a question I have to ask."
Do you know of anyone who would want Jeff Ingram dead?
I don't know anyone who even knew who he was.
"Now... well, except Audrey."
Does that answer your question?
"I know it's crazy, but it's the only thing"
That makes any sense.
"No, it doesn't."
I just have to...
I just have to...
"Oh, God!"
-
- What have I done?
-
- What have you done?
It's time for a bit of advanced training.
I've got to get a bit of steel into you.
It's no good g--going through life laying back and letting things happen to you... like your mother used to!
"Oh, 'eck!"
I've been sweeping round these things for two years!
"Why don't you give up on these, eh?"
You're never gonna get rid of these.
Who's gonna buy these?
Don't worry about them.
They're too advanced for you.
Stick to basics like how the h--hell you're gonna pay for that ice cream.
"You know, you can't just drag people into the shop."
This is not dragging 'em in.
It's propelling 'em in this direction as if by accident.
-
"- All right, show me."
-
- You've seen me do it often enough.
I've always been too embarrassed to watch.
It's not a case of embarrassment.
It's a test of skill.
"Well, I hope this section never gets published in me biography."
"I'm warning you, if ever I become famous, well, one day, I want absolutely no reference to this."
I see.
"Ashamed of it, are you?"
"I'm not taking any time off, I swear."
"Whoa, Brian, it's okay to take a break every now and then."
- It is?
"- Yeah, absolutely."
"In fact, coffee preparation is very important."
Yeah.
"Actually, making coffee is one of my favorite hobb..."
That's great.
"Listen to me, I need to ask you something."
"The other day when I said those things to you about taking time off, I mean, I don't even know"
- if you remember it.
- Like it was yesterday.
"Well, in that case I was just wondering... how bad was I?"
You weren't that bad.
Good.
"Now, would you be willing to swear to that in court?"
- What?
Why?
- No reason.
"Truth is, my recollection is exactly the same as yours."
"You asked for a couple days off, and I gave it to you."
"See, I even wrote it in my diary."
"""Gave Brian two days off."
"Felt good about it."""
It looks like you just wrote that today.
- What makes you say that?
- It has today's date on top.
I just wrote that down to remember today's conversation.
Can I go back to work now?
"Yep, just make sure you have the affidavit on my desk as soon as possible."
"Thanks for seeing us on such short notice, Ms. Randolph."
"I have to say, when I heard the name Frank Gallo, my interest was piqued."
One minute.
"Give us a minute, Okay?"
Does it hurt?
They gave me some aspirin.
"Enjoy it, because it's the last fucking drug you'll ever take."
"-I'm sorry, T."
-Shut the fuck up and listen to me.
"You're my nephew, Christopher, and I love you."
That's the only reason you're alive right now.
"If it were anybody else, anybody... they would've had their intervention through the back of their head."
"You and me, we're close."
We've done a lot of things for each other.
That cop shot my father.
"I know what you're telling me, I'll never forget that."
This is how you repay me.
I gotta worry if you'll flip over a nickel bag of white powder.
"-No, Tony, never."
-You lied to me.
"I told you, you were the future of this family."
I gave you that responsibility.
"And you looked me in the eye, and you accepted it... and you were fucking high."
Shut up.
Tomorrow morning I gotta go with Patsy up to this rehab place in Pennsylvania.
You're going in.
You're staying in.
"You'll go to every session, and you'll keep your mouth shut."
"Now, if you need anything, anything at all..."
Patsy's going to be half a mile away from you... in a motel.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
-Do you understand?
"-Tony, I'm sorry!"
How did I fucking get to this?
Any reasonable person would be scared.
Not me.
Nope.
And they punished you for it.
Made you feel like a traitor for doing your job.
I just did what I was trained to do.
"I know, Mr. Petty."
The cold and the fear...
And the wave after wave of enemy soldiers coming across those frozen fields.
You never knew who the enemy might be.
Even women and children.
Children?
Tossing land mines everywhere?
Little soldiers.
And so you did what you had to do.
"You went to the village of Wonju, put the mines where they got their water, where they played in the fields."
Trying 55 volts at 2/10 of a second.
"That's right, Mr. Petty."
It's okay.
It's all going to be okay.
"You were in the 45th division in Korea, it's that right Mr. Madsen?"
"If you know, why are you asking?"
"You got your degree in medical doctoring, right?"
I did my residency in internal medicine.
Then you explain to me why a perfectly healthy man spends most of his time in infirmary and not on work detail.
I assumed you were ill.
"Well, you'd think I was after all the blood they're taking."
"I know all about the new lag, the one who likes to blow things up."
Is that his voice on the tape?
"If you want to know what the song is, then you find out why I am in here all the time."
Deal.
The song?
"Hubby, what shall we do?"
Fashion design?
!
Court.
"Prosecutor, you can start your final address now."
Although sentiment counts beyond law.
One should be punished if he killed.
You'd better think.
"If your family was killed, what'll you do?"
"Now, all the evidences which the court admitted, prove Ho Foon is the murderer."
I request the jury would plead Ho Foon guilty.
Defence counsel.
My husband paid me to study law in UK.
"But I am so sorry to him, I didn't study law."
I studied fashion design.
"I am not well educated, but I don't understand one thing."
What's more important?
Legal procedure or life?
"Your Honour, if you don't mind me telling my point of view."
"I think that, you've studied so many years of law, you have got nothing at all."
"Like my husband, I haven't studied law."
But I dare to open my eyes to see what's right and wrong.
I am proud of my hubby.
I love him.
"Jury, I believe that you are not nuts."
You should know how to judge.
"If all of you are nuts, it'll be useless to say anything."
Thank you very much.
You've been released!
Yes.
You heard everything?
Yes.
That is absurd.
All I could think was:
"""This isn't happening."
My sister loves me.
"And what the hell is Hello Kitty smiling at?"""
- Is that why you never came to see me?
- No.
- That place freaked me out.
- Of course it freaks you out.
- It freaks everybody out.
It's a loony bin.
"- Well, it scares me to see you like that."
"Allie, I need a sister that's gonna be there."
I need to know you're not just an illusion in my head.
I need to know your voice is really happening.
- I'm afraid.
- You need to stop being afraid of me.
"Lucy, I'm not afraid of you."
I'm afraid of becoming you.
"Bread pudding, everyone."
"There was that warm Columbus Day weekend when Dad was barbecuing his special wings, when that woman called."
She said there was something very wrong with you and that they'd taken you from your dorm in restraints.
I'd seen you the week before.
We'd taken you out in Westwood for your birthday.
"You were 19, the same age I am now."
You know how you told Luke that I was always the prettier one and the smarter one and the star of the family?
"Well, you forgot that I have better boobs too."
"Um, you do not have better boobs."
"Uh, mmm..."
"All right, fine, the boobs are a toss-up."
Um...
But you're right about the other stuff.
"A brilliant bloke like him, too."
"Cutter, we got to do something."
Come here.
- What now?
"- Look, Mac... for four days we've been waiting for them Thugs to start something."
Four days in this cruel heat and horrible tension.
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.
Go on.
"Three hours from where we're sitting, by a secret trail... there's a gold temple waiting to be sliced away and carried off."
Have you started after this buried treasure again?
"Just a minute, Mac."
This one ain't buried.
"According to Gunga Din, it's standing right out in the open."
"According to Gunga Din, eh?"
I thought he might have been at the bottom of this.
What's the idea of this lushing?
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!
Just a minute.
"MacChesney, I'm here to speak, and I'm going to have my say."
"You want Ballantine to stay with us, don't you?"
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right.
Just a minute.
It's as easy as parting your hair.
"We take Bal to the temple, show him the gold... and the moment he starts slicing at it... marriage and the tea business will whiz from his mind."
"MacChesney, versus that, you can't think of a single argument."
"Cutter, I'm warning you."
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?
I'm sick of it!
-I don't know.
Prayed.
They grew out of his mattress.
"Come on, Steve."
Hey.
- What do we do for decorations?
-For that you got to pray yourself.
"""And so, Joey we do hope that you will finish that last year of law school when you come back home."""
Law school?
"Hey, you don't want to be no stinking lawyer with a stinking briefcase in a stinking office, do you, Joey?"
No.
"""And do keep writing, son."
Your letters are very dear to us.
"With all our love, Dad."""
"Hey, it's from your dad, Joey."
"Here, take it."
"Next time we write to your folks, you know what you're gonna say?"
You're gonna say that you don't wanna be no lawyer.
"That you wanna be a musician, maybe, huh?"
And play the ﬂute.
"Yeah, Joey?"
"""I saw a wonderful article on German prison camps in one of the magazines."""
Mom reads a lot.
"""They showed pictures of the tennis courts and they also say that in the winter they freeze them over so you boys can ice skate."""
Anything about us grouse hunting in the Vienna woods?
"""In a way, I'm glad you're not in America right now with everything rationed here, like gas and meat."""
"Heart-rendering, ain't it?"
Why don't we send them some food parcels?
What do all those broads say?
What do they always say?
Let me read one.
"It's not good for you, Animal."
No.
I'm staying here.
"Good night, Franz."
Why don't we all just go to bed?
"You don't know me, otherwise you wouldn't suggest that we all just go to bed."
"Have yourself a nice evening, and drink some cognac down at Tonis."
We'll see you tomorrow.
"My mother used to always say, the best guests are the ones who complain."
That way you can always improve yourself.
My mother worked in this restaurant for fifty years.
And I think...
There's far too little complaining here.
Can I finally get back to work boss?
I'm not done yet.
"Angie, there are problems."
What kind of problems?
We'll do a little demonstration for you.
Are you ready?
What kind of demonstration then?
Just say that your ready!
In that case I'm ready.
"What can I do for you, boss?"
A beer for me.
You want something too?
I'd like a soda please.
A beer and a soda.
Right away boss.
"What sort of demonstration is this supposed to be, boss?"
"We're not done yet, Angie."
"Angela, my name is Angela, and not Angie, boss."
"Angie, you are, generally speaking, if I may say  the problem that some people have with service industry."
But actually the problem isn't you.
"Meaning, even if the odds are only 1 in 1,000 that I can get the job done, there's still a chance"
"so yeah, I had defective semen."
"But in the land of the blind, the one eyed man is king."
"Well friends, I believe Chips has just settle the old question:"
Is philosophy to real life as masturbation is to sex?
And the answer is?
Sometimes you want to have a wank and a shag in the same day
six girls?
That's nicely done.
Just putting to good use my large sex organ my brain.
"Thanks for that, Chips."
Don't forget to leave me your textbooks.
"You trouble me, Eric,"
taking out your issues with me on James.
Not your finest hour.
He isn't smart enough for you.
How can you still not see it?
"Being smart isn't everything, has it done for you just what you hoped?"
Punishing him makes no sense...
Because he doesn't know about us.
I'm not sure he needs to know.
Especially after the way you behaved today.
"I love him, so leave him alone."
I just couldn't put all the pieces together
Who could?
You.
Nobody is trying to take anything away from you.
I got mad at you about going to Cornell.
I still don't understand how he got in.
I wrote his essay for him.
Did you?
No.
"Oh, look what's happened to city property."
No... but I'm still gonna take you to school.
- Just soon as I...
- Come on.
You jeopardized my life's work.
My accountants' are desperate.
You've proved yourself incompetent yet again.
I don't even know if I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?
I trusted you enough
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.
Don't tell me you don't trust me.
We have to trust each other.
Right.
I trust everybody.
Yes...
"Well, fortunately,"
I thought of something very spectacular which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money.
"Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money."
"But, before we celebrate your return to sanity, we'd better do something about Tony's sister."
How did she know we were at the museum?
I...
I'm not certain.
Tony.
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?
Telepathy.
She'll show up again and ruin everything.
"In that case, she will have to be, as you would say Scratched?"
Tia.
Tia.
What happened to you?
I can't explain now.
"Figured I'd keep tabs on you, you know, in case something popped up."
'Cause she misses us.
PATTON:
Agent Gregorio!
Hey!
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Let's pretend you didn't.
I have to get back to the Garcia case before I don't have a case to get back to.
Good luck!
I thought she hated beignets.
She does.
"So, we got four robberies, all connected to the racing circuit, marked money in Jared's garage."
Neither Russ or Dana are talking.
Hard not to think that they're the bank robbers.
"Yeah, except Dana seemed more scared than guilty."
Check Jared's leave record.
See where he was on each of the robberies.
Copy that.
"Hey, you might want to check, see if any of 'em are cyber geeks."
I dove into the specifics of how they manipulated that car crash.
"Whoever did it, they are good."
I'm talking Mensa hacker level good.
"Yeah, but..."
it wasn't Jared.
"According to the marines, he was TDY on three of the four robberies."
So he couldn't have been a part of the crew.
Maybe he found out about it and tried to do the right thing and got killed before he could.
Still doesn't explain why he got stabbed or why Dana was too scared to talk.
Maybe we ought to take another run at the father now?
This time with a warrant.
(keys jingle)
"Good, good... that's what I like, willing footmen."
Bend over.
"""Oh, they're so naughty!"""
Early scientists also used kites in an attempt to harness electricity from lightning.
Foxsmith is preparing a tribute to these brave men.
He's also hoping to generate a spark among the group.
"So, are you going to go for Everett then or what, Miss Hopkins?"
No.
No?
No.
Why is my love life the topic of today's discussion?
- Really.
- I'm sorry.
"I just I mean,"
"I'm quite happy being single, thanks."
I think Mr. Everett's great.
He has a heart of gold.
He's just an all-around great guy.
This place is like living in a fairy tale... and...
"I could see myself being swept up in it all and... it scares me... it really, really scares me."
Kite makers...
"Sorry, I was on my way to my bath and a letter's arrived which I thought we'd all like to hear."
It's rather good news.
"Um, it's from our friend Mr. Carrington."
Who is coming back to join us.
"He enjoyed his time so much at Kentchurch over the weekend that ""I can't wait to get back there and be amongst such illustrious company."""
So isn't that good news?
Very good news.
Everyone happy?
"You know, it'll be nice to have some music back in the house."
And that's the only reason?
"And a nice, happy, smiling face."
People actually cheered for us.
- How about the Hansons?
"- Yeah, the Hansons."
Killed them.
Didn't see them put one in the net.
"Hey, I looked for you after the game."
What game?
All I saw was a wrestling match.
Got to give people what they want.
"Put butts in seats, win the vote."
Yeah?
"Well, keep playing that way, you won't be seeing this butt in the seats any more."
Interesting style of play.
"Had to let them know we meant business, sir."
That's how it was when I was a boy.
Hard-nosed hockey.
"I admire you, kid."
I do.
"But if all this is about the vote on your home,"
I don't see much hope in hockey changing their minds.
What if I told you we already changed one?
A big one.
"It seems these boys have been inspired by rumours that Mayor David Kenneth plans to support their petition to save the Newman Home when he returns from his vision quest in Peru, if he ever returns at all."
"Man, that's awesome."
I can't believe this!
I want names.
Good newsman never reveals his sources.
There isn't a good newsman within 50 miles of here.
"I'm just trying to capture the spirit of the thing, Bernie."
Is it true?
"Well, no, no, no, no, hang on a tick."
Our office was not contacted for this story and the mayor is unreachable.
I was afraid it was gonna mess us up.
But you told Chloe.
Chloe and my sister have been helping me take care of the baby.
She's a good friend.
Excuse me.
Chase?
You wanted me to let you know when Angela woke up.
- Thank you.
- Sure.
"Kim, I'm just as confused as you are."
But all I know is that I love you.
"And I'm falling in love with Angela, too."
And I need to make this work.
Go on.
What's happening with Nina in interrogation?
They're getting something.
What?
The connection between Alvers and Nina might be deeper than we thought.
"You'd better hope she's not just spinning your wheels, because she knows how to manipulate our interrogation protocol."
Tony knows what he's doing.
"Okay, fine."
"Look, I need to get together with Chloe."
I need everything that she's got on the Amador investigation.
Not yet.
"Ryan, look, you're wasting my time."
"Now, I humored you with the physical."
"And we both know that my blood work's gonna come back with trace amounts of opiates, but enough is enough."
Rae Plachecki from the inspector general's office is here.
She wants to talk to you.
"- Well, this is not the time."
"- Actually, it is."
"You'll talk to her, then we'll evaluate whether you can go back to work or not."
Flippa!
(retching)
"What gives, brah?"
You're supposed to be my GPS.
"Sorry, cuz, I got seasick."
I see why our navigation system's on the fritz.
"Well, leaving your first mate in charge of the liquor may not have been the most prudent move."
"Don't sweat it, Doc."
I got an auxiliary engine just for this situation.
(engine whining)
I assume you checked that the battery was charged before we set sail.
This thing has a battery?
Mayday.
Mayday.
This is the SS Thong Magnet needing emergency assistance.
And I'm afraid the radio is powered by the battery as well.
And we lost cell service a few hours ago.
Why are you so calm about this?
"Well, I project outward confidence as a way of coping with stress."
"Inside, I'm terrified."
We're gonna die out here.
Nobody's dying on my watch.
All we got to do is send a distress signal up.
Coast Guard will come and tow us to shore.
(clicking)
"You got to be kidding me, brah."
Must be a safety-- give it here.
"Sure, let the drunk guy handle the firearm."
Great idea.
"Everyone chill, I got this."
"Well, there's no missing that."
I heard you got something.
We don't even know who she is.
Could she be a prostitute?
Whoa!
"Mrs. Stein isn't gonna like hearing that,suzanne."
"Neither is this woman, whoever she is."
"I mean hypothetically, if the woman is a hooker,"
She could have rolled stein for his money.
"What is this,aruba?"
We're just making theories up.
Americans have a right to a fair trial.
"Actually,ron's right."
"At this point,"
"We don't know what she is,"
And we don't know if she was involved in this.
She has to be involved.
Witnesses saw her with stein.
I hear stein had a terrible temper.
Did anyone else hear that or know anybody who was a victim of that?
Maybe the poor girl was defending herself.
I don't remember.
How long did you two date?
We didn't date.
I'd see him at parties and premieres and award shows.
Beats going to keggers at frat houses.
That's the great thing about going to college here
Is that you can go to all that hollywood stuff.
"I'd see stein at these things,"
"And he would flirt with me and ask me out,"
And i always said no.
"Until you said ""yes."""
We just went to dinner a couple times.
That's all.
A trauma brought on by my own father!
My life changed forever that day.
You sacrificed me for the traveler.
Why?
"Who is it, dad?"
Who is it?
!
"What if I told you now, that you are the traveler?"
You're right.
Your life truly changed that day.
I told you in the helicopter that you were destined for a great future.
"That's why I've been so hard on you, trained you so relentlessly."
"Think, Lex."
You have survived mortal injuries so many times.
How else can you explain it?
Because I was trained never to accept defeat.
"When I get my hands on that box in Zurich,"
I have a feeling all my questions will be answered.
I know how strong it is...
The attraction of the dark power.
But it will destroy you.
I can't let you go down that terrible path.
I can't open it... because I need a second key.
Give it to me.
I've swept every possible place you could have hidden it.
"And I finally realized, there's only person you would trust it with."
Yourself.
"If you open that box, if you get hold of that secret,"
there will be no redemption for you.
No redemption.
Ever.
I was raised in your shadow.
"Well, I can't even remember the name."
Flett-giordano syndrome.
And you're welcome.
What?
You started the rumor?
"Well, now you can beat the dead girl... at her own game."
But-- but you can't just say that I have a disease.
I've never even heard of it.
"Well, no one has."
That's the beauty of it.
"Uh, Victoria Chase."
"Yes, I'll hold for people magazine."
Elka.
I need a list of really fun things... to do in Cleveland.
"Will's coming, and we haven't really... spoken much since the divorce, and I really wanna reconnect with him."
"So if you were a 20-year-old boy, what would you wanna do with your mom?"
Watch her buy me beer?
"Hey, joy."
Where you been?
"Okay, don't go all Melanie on me, but I decided to take your suggestion... and I met with a couple of potential therapists."
Wow.
How did it go?
They're all so nosy.
Asking me questions about... my childhood and feelings and sex... and saying I need to come in four times a week.
"I mean, who can talk about themselves for that long?"
"And then at age 12, I decided becoming an actress... would be the best way to serve humanity."
"No, no, no, thank you."
"Oh, Elka."
You are a genius.
"Elka came up with this Internet rumor... that I have this very, very promotable deadly disease."
"Well, I'm sure nothing could go wrong with that."
Oh.
Fuckin' figure it out.
Better not forget those fuckin' all-dressed chips.
No ketchup chips neither.
WAYNE:
Figure it out.
Somebody really ought to write a letter.
"They do got six different types of Cap'n Crunch, though."
How do you know that?
Saw a comedian talks about it on the Juste Pour Rires.
"Can't remember his name, though."
"Good guy, though?"
A little long-winded for my taste.
"But, yeah, a pretty good guy."
"Well, glad to hear he's a good guy at least."
They have running water down there?
"Anyhoo, the evening went so well that, uh, we got up to a little bits of a foolin' around."
Did you French her?
WAYNE:
"Kind of out of line there, Dary."
- Did you go up her shirt?
"- Now you're really out of line, Dary."
"We did French, that much I will reveal."
"Well, you already revealed that much, might as well just tell us if you went up her shirt."
"It's impolite to kiss and tell, Dary."
"I don't like to kiss and tell, but..."
"The Frenchin's tooks a hard left turn, from which I have yets to recover."
Do you wanna know what?
"I'm not asking you to kiss and tell, 'cause that's impolite."
But...
I'm kind of curious.
"Yeah, Dan, kiss and tell."
I'm sure you boys have had a couple  of curve balls thrown your way betwixt the sheets.
"So, there are 100 possible combinations."
It is really hard to guess.
But Kaan has an amazing idea...
"When the day for stealing comes, we'll arrange for Gamze to be the guard on duty."
"When Professor Fatma is in our class, you'll make your move."
I can't.
I get panic attacks.
"You will not panic, sweetheart, you will only attack."
"Professor, there is an urgent phone call for you that you have to take."
- Really?
Who could it be?
"- I don't know, professor."
I am coming right away.
Don't make any noise.
"When Professor Fatma leaves the class, I'll go next to the table and pretend to be looking at the attendance sheet."
The bag will most probably be open...
I'll get the password without anyone noticing.
- They have hung up the phone.
- I don't know professor.
Sure you don't.
When one day they come to ask for your hand... how are you to start a family and raise kids?
So irresponsible!
How are we going to get the questions from the bag?
I am answering.
A) During lunch break.
"Meaning, while there is no one in the school or the teachers' room."
Kaan and I have been watching her for the last few days.
She never goes out with that bag.
She always leaves it at school.
Meaning in the cupboard of her room.
Congratulations!
Correct answer.
Get away from the door.
Jessie is a friend
"Yeah, I know he's been A good friend of mine"
But lately something's changed That ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl And I want to make her mine
And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late Late at night
"You know,.."
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Private staff quarters are strictly off limits to hotel guests!
I'm so sorry that we are disturbing your fortress of solitude here.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave The Ponderosa immediately.
"Well, that's a shame, because the place is so inviting."
When does Hoss and Little Joe show up?
Dave.
You gentlemen have broken into The Ponderosa and have broken the rules of this island.
"And, unfortunately, I don't think you're gonna like the consequences."
I'm gonna call monsieur Marcel.
"No, no, no, no, no, no."
"Sctanley, there's been a big misunderstanding."
Some of us don't necessarily want to be here.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Smith, but you've broken the rules and there are consequences."
"Yes, could you get Marcel for me, please?"
"Yes, I know he's asleep, but wake him."
This is important.
I'll hold.
What a shocker that this went bad.
Thank you.
Came here for answers and now I'm not gonna get them!
Great.
"Like your mother, there's nothing that you can't do either."
"Now, things are going to be easier now between you and Michael."
"You should have the kind of a marriage that you deserve, a good one."
"My beautiful daughter and her fine, upstanding young man."
"Things will be happy, Daddy."
Doctor?
That's interesting.
Why would Blake Carrington want you to see a doctor?
"For a very obvious reason, Joel."
I've been playing that I have a headache so I won't have to perform my wifely duties.
So he doesn't realise I'm not his darling Krystle.
"He's sick and tired of your headache, sleeping alone and feeling lonely."
Exactly.
"Rita, why don't you go to the doctor?"
All you have to do is pretend to take whatever pills he gives you.
It's like back problems.
You can't prove a headache.
"Well, suppose he wants me to take a blood test and mine doesn't match your aunt's, then what?"
Then nothing.
Her blood will match perfectly.
"I should know, I'm her doctor."
- You?
- Me.
This is perfect.
Don't you see?
Either one of you?
"What are you talking about, Joel?"
I've just cast myself.
I'm going to be playing Krystle Carrington's good doctor.
This is the chance I've been waiting for.
My chance to get into the house.
What better way than to be a specialist she's asked for on the advice of a friend.
It's not just that worrying you.
You can't stop thinking about that portrait of your family.
It won't get out of my head.
Just yesterday I was posing with my family.
My mother scolded me because I wouldn't sit still.
"When we finish the mission, we'll find out what happened to your family."
"I don't know if I want to find out, Julián."
There it is.
A new mission awaits us.
Victory or death.
I prefer the first one.
Me too.
You two go and see the Prior.
And you?
I'll start looking.
With this habit no one will suspect anything.
Be careful.
And to what do we owe your visit?
There is a risk of imminent attack by the Maquis.
I doubt it.
We are peaceful people.
and because of that have always been respected.
A big fish in the German army is coming to visit this monastery.
We need to be sure that nothing happens to him.
"Do what you wish, but do not bother the brothers."
You've arrived just at lunch time.
(Door creaking open)
(Two shots)
Throw down your weapons!
"Look, how thoughtful."
This one doesn't need subtitles.
I said to throw down your weapons.
It's ugly.
It's loud.
It's always moving.
I never feel still long enough to hold a thought.
I feel sick out there among the people.
"I need to remedy this, and an opportunity has presented itself."
I'm gonna take it.
I've got no money and no hope of another advance.
I'm doing what's best for me.
"Yeah, you're doing what you're best at."
You're looking out for your own self interests without thinking about how it might affect me or anybody else.
Typical!
You're hardly around anyway.
You won't even notice.
"Hey, don't tell me I'm not gonna notice that I'm alone all of a sudden."
Why can't you do something that involves me?
Why can't we go somewhere together?
"You know, alone or..."
Is it the money?
Because I don't mind if you need to borrow some again...
"Put your money away, all right?"
I'm not taking any money from you.
Those days are behind me.
"Forever, I told myself."
I hope this will be good for us.
But especially for me.
You are selfish and unsentimental.
- Everyone knows this about you.
- You say that like it's a bad thing.
On the contrary.
"An admirable trait, if you ask me."
I come from an unsupportive background.
"- I went to vocational school, Sir."
"Besides, I wasn't born yet."
"- Yes, how time flies!"
"""Ruit hora"" as says.. um..."
- Horace.
- Horace.
"I was saying, our case is one of mythomania."
The word comes from the Greek:
"mitos, myth, mania, mania."
"It's formed in the psyche, in the subconscious, a sort of gap."
"It lowers, it lowers blinds that.."
Blocks the memory.
"- No, not exactly."
It lowers the blinds..
"yeah, fine, that blocks the memory."
"Excuse me, Sir, did you see that guy?"
Can it really be him?
"That's not a man but a gnome, a runt!"
"- Papa, what do you know, excuse me?"
"It's a question of the subconscious, as the counselor rightly said."
It all depends on the fact that if it lowers we call it blinds.
We all have our blinds.
"Oh, perfect!"
"You have believed in good faith, and we'll support you with our doctrine that he was the other."
In these long years of solitude you created from reality a totally ideal image that matched the other.
"Don't worry, ma'am, I'll take care of you."
Thank you.
"Sir, excuse me, what about Mario?"
"Mario, who is Mario?"
- What do you mean?
"Mario De Santis, her husband."
- No.
[ Gasps ] Or when we broke into Tom's house and we locked his girlfriend in the closet?
Wow.
We sound totally insane when you string 'em all together.
You ready for another crazy adventure?
"The crazier, the better!"
- [ Laughs ] - [ Laughs ]
"So, like, normally, this is the moment where I would pound my drink and then smash it against the wall, but I'm kind of at a loss here."
- Would these help?
- [ Gasps ]
Soul mates!
"Party in the bathroom stall, y'all!"
Oh!
Isn't it great that you can still get crazy when you're a mom?
It's time to put the popular girls in their place.
"Hey, catty cheerleaders, you want some real gossip?"
Your jock boyfriends are all in love with each other.
"Ellie, I am trying to focus on my job."
"Me, too."
You think this dumb prom's gonna mock itself?
Prom is not dumb!
It's a beautiful night of magic and wonder.
"And sometimes, a poor kid's life is destroyed forever."
But that won't happen here.
"Oh, no!"
Not on my watch!
It sounds like you're working through some stuff.
I'm gonna leave you to it.
And I gotta get back to my thang.
"Hey, bet you 5 bucks that 5 years from now, that condom will still be in your pocket."
You get it.
He's not gonna ever use it.
It's not that heavy.
It's only one loaf!
Sometimes it happens to be the l--l--last loaf on the shelf.
"Customer comes in and says, ""I'll take that last loaf off you."""
And I have to turn down a sale.
Do you realise wh--what it does to a shopkeeper to turn down a sale?
I know what it does to you.
You get nasty.
That is a secondary symptom.
The first thing that happens is m--me top lip goes numb.
It goes absolutely lifeless.
It lies there as dead as if it had been n--nationalised.
-
- Me moustache loses all its lustre.
-
- It's looked like that for years!
Never!
"It's been very lively in its time, has this moustache."
"No, it's me lips where rigor mortis s--suddenly sets in."
"Well, they're due for a rest, anyway!"
"It's not funny, Granville!"
"It's a hell of a place for something to die on you, right under your nose!"
A very peculiar sensation.
L--l--I have...
I have d--difficulty f--f--formulating my words.
Really?
I'm sure it's not noticeable!
Me finger ends get all constricted.
Tried taking them out of the pockets?
I don't g--go around with my hands in me p--pockets!
Not your pockets -- other people's pockets!
"Listen, if you want to succeed in business, you have to have a streak of ruthlessness."
Either that or a rich wife!
"You're right, that didn't help me at all."
"All right, well, I can tell you this:"
"Gay or straight, you're not gonna get anywhere by being inactive."
She likes you.
Maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something.
"Hit me up with an oatmeal raisin, will you?"
- Thanks.
- Here you go.
TRENT:
"If a girl's into you, she's sleeping with you."
"If after a month, or two months at the very outside she's not sleeping with you?"
She doesn't like you.
The trick is to spot this girl early.
Don't wanna waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out it's never gonna happen.
So I've come up with some signs about how to spot this girl.
"A girl will never sleep with you if she calls you ""cuddly"" or ""dependable."""
"If she pops a zit in front of you if her name is Amber or Christine if she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers on dates one, two, or three."
"I know it's not scientific but I'm just saying, you were warned."
"Wait, stop."
What?
BEN:
Shit.
What?
I am so into you.
"Seriously, I've never felt like this before."
I have to actively stop my brain from thinking about you.
"Like, all the time."
Why stop?
Because I don't do stuff like this.
Stuff like what?
Like sleep with women that aren't my wife.
"First of all, I am not ""women,"" I'm just one."
"If I sell my Porsche, that'll buy me at least six months."
"Maybe by then, my investment will start to pay off."
"I guess it's pretty scary, huh?"
"I'm so sorry, Sebastian."
Pete?
Pete!
- Hi.
- Maggie.
You seriously didn't have to come see me off.
"- No, I did."
"- No, you didn't."
I've got pretty good instincts when it comes to breakups.
They teach us situational awareness in boot camp.
You were sending some very clear signals.
No!
"No, I wasn't sending clear signals."
That's the thing.
"Uh, you barely dressed up to see me, wouldn't even kiss me, and that diner..."
- Kind of the opposite of romantic.
- I know.
I know.
I...
I've been trying really hard to keep you at bay so I wouldn't screw this up like I have my other relationships.
What are you talking about?
It's just...
I've made a lot of mistakes in the past.
And I don't want to repeat them.
So I'm just gonna be honest with you and hope that you don't want to break up with me after I say all this.
"The fact is, I sleep with people way too soon..."
Or people who are just wrong for me and think it's love.
"Because I totally confuse sex with love, and then I get my heart broken or make huge mistakes."
And I really like you.
I was bowled over by her journey.
And that was priceless.
Stop sticking your weenie into what's not yours!
"You know other ways to prove your cocksmanship, don't you?"
Shut it!
"Watch it, Albert..."
The good lord rears his ugly head when a prick tries not to understand.
"As long as you punch me, Albert!"
When you're punching me I know you're alive!
"At last, we got the address for Mickey's hidey-hole!"
We've been in the know for an hour.
Savvy?
You'll understand.
Sorry for now.
Sorry for before.
Sorry for after.
I didn't know how to get hold of you.
"By the time I snuffed out the fuse, you'd disappeared."
I called back.
I looked.
"Le Baron tracked you down, he looked up the name of your cousin, thanks to her centerfold in that nudie mag."
"He bought out this apartment, just across from yours, because I asked them to."
Top dollar!
They never understood my caprices!
And Mickey?
What did you do to him?
I destroy everything I love!
"I told you, I am a liar."
"The Venom is here, not entirely eradicated."
"By the way, did you know he used to be one of my mother's lovers?"
"He just found out that you can't put a price tag on love, this venomous man."
A small time punk proved to him that he couldn't keep something that he thought he could junk.
I'll give you back your man-goggles.
Here.
"I just thought we might run into some cute boys on the way home, but it's probably best we didn't."
That's a pretty angry lip you got there.
- Really?
- Uh-huh.
Wow.
Does everybody's get this red?
"Well, you had quite a bit of growth."
"I was gonna have that lady take a crack at your arms, but she had already sweat through her apron."
"Oh, my gosh!"
I already have 100 likes on my picture of my new nails.
"Um, FYI, I'm..."
"I'm sort of in the background there, screaming mid-wax."
400 people liked this photo.
I was not one of them.
"My art teacher made a pithy ""blue period"" comment, and my top prom prospect suddenly found a girlfriend in Canada."
Do you think I could get my sneakers back?
"Ohh, I threw them away with the rest of your clothes when you were in the changing room."
"I thought about saving them for the housekeeper, but I couldn't remember if she had a son."
"Look, I've tried really hard to put up with a lot since..."
What's going on?
"Oh, I just had so much fun with you!"
We don't do this enough.
I just wish there was something that you could teach me.
Uh-huh.
"Wait, what about your Judo stuff?"
Uh you're not interested in that.
No!
No!
I am!
Come on!
Where you been?
- Heaven.
- Tell me where you been.
"What, are you fucking wearing lipstick?"
When'd you start wearing lipstick?
Where you been?
Tell me where you been and don't lie.
"Don't tell me you been at Tina's, 'cause your mother already colluded on that lie and I'm not buying it."
"- I don't have to lie to you, I don't have to tell you anything."
- You're dating that nigger again.
"- Yeah, I don't date niggers, Dad, I just fuck 'em."
- There's something wrong with you.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- There's something wrong with you.
"- Yeah, what's wrong with me?"
- Somebody should put you away.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- She's got a mouth on her.
"I mean, the way she talks."
You know what I heard?
"That all teenage girls, they got, like, a hormonal imbalance, so no matter what you do, you know, you could smack 'em and smack 'em."
"beat the shit out of them, tell them right from wrong, it ain't gonna get through."
- That's true.
"She gonna be married in another year anyway, Horace."
Let some other guy smack her out.
"- Your people do that a lot, donât' they, George?"
- Say what?
- You smack the shit out of your kids.
"- Well, I just do what my daddy did, man."
- A teenage girl hates her father.
She's supposed to.
It's a biological imperative so she doesn't fuck her father.
To commemorate my time here. so i hope to see you there.
Both of you.
Is that a program?
Yeah. and smile.
Today's the first day of the rest of your life.
Way ahead of you.
This graduation is a celebration for us too.
No more mean girls.
We have suffered under their dictatorship for way too long.
"Starting next fall, there'll be peace in the kingdom."
J. wanna throw your hat in the ring?
What are you talking about?
Queen. what else is there to talk about?
The fact that there's not gonna be a queen next year?
What would high school be without hierarchy?
Bearable?
a nice place to spend time?
Ladies.
I thought we were matching our headbands under our caps.
- What's going on?
- your minions were just telling me
About the search for the next queen.
They don't get to choose the next queen. i do.
"And take off that hideous scarf, penelope."
You can see if from space.
Not so fast j. don't waste your time appealing to blair.
We don't listen to her anymore.
The coronation happens at midnight at nate archibald's party.
Whoever brings us the biggest piece of untold
Constance gossip wins and you've got competition.
The new girl emma boardman transferring in next year.
Nice to meet you little j.
Silence!
I made a program for you and you decided not to follow it.
You defied my instructions and you went off course.
"Why are we being held to a different standard, Marcel?"
You weren't here on time this morning.
"I was here before sunrise, sadly, by myself."
"Therefore, I chose not to wait."
"Marcel, I've got to be honest with you."
You know...
Silence!
"No, you silence!"
"Please, just..."
"I don't need some speech about moments, okay?"
"No more, okay?"
"I'm sorry that we kept you waiting this morning and that we didn't respect your program, but last night my wife and I, we spent some real time together, and for the first time in a long time,"
"we woke up actually very, very happy."
"So, with all due respect, sir,"
"I don't need you, or anyone else for that matter, to, you know, say anything, really."
I know.
Sorry?
You do?
Yes.
That is why I am giving you this.
I don't understand.
I could never reveal your true inner animal spirit.
It was always up to you.
"Cynthia, Jason, your spirit is the rabbit."
"No matter what obstacles are put in front of him, the rabbit will scrape and burrow and find a way to create his home."
Thank you.
Thank you.
"Lucy, Joseph."
"For you, the wolf."
"Okay, here's our Taurus coming out of the Biltmore service garage."
We pick him up 50 yards away on a surveillance cam at Commerce Bank.
Valera's headed west.
We catch him on a traffic cam at this intersection.
We catch him on the library's weather cam.
Got the results back on that fabric swatch.
Blood's AB-negative.
Sara's O-positive.
It's not her blood.
So whose blood did Marcy bring us?
Run it through CODIS for DNA.
"Okay, there's Valera's starting point."
Let's roll it.
"Okay, we lose him here for a minute as he passes out of the CBD, but keep watching."
Looks like he's headed toward the 20.
Which puts him west toward Alabama.
Roll it back.
The weather cam time code puts them at the on-ramp at 7:22.
Now roll it back.
But this traffic cam puts him at the tunnel at 7:18.
So why did it take him so long to get to the on-ramp?
Traffic doesn't seem to be an issue.
Go full frame.
Keep your eyes on this SUV.
Freeze it!
The Taurus is right behind the SUV entering the tunnel.
"There's the SUV exiting, but where's the Taurus?"
The Taurus must have pulled over inside the tunnel.
That's our transfer point.
"If there was a handoff, both vehicles would've interrupted traffic flow."
That compare who's going in... with who's coming out.
"Other than Valera's Taurus, no interruption."
- Then you better hope
Gallo doesn't leave her a message the same way he left me one.

"Staring out the window, Louis?"
That's a sign that something's going on.
"Nothing's going on, Rachel."
Then why exactly did you make Brian Altman relive that horrible day?
- Which horrible day?
- The one where you treated him like shit because you were losing your mind.
That day.
You want to know what's going on?
I'm being sued.
That's what's going on.
- By Brian?
"- No, by Stephanie."
For sexual harassment?
"Louis, this is bad."
"- I know what it is, Rachel."
"- Well, then we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it."
"No, we need to talk about how you're gonna handle it."
"Louis, that's not a good idea."
It's the only good idea.
You need to go over there right now and put an end to this.
- I can't do that.
- Why not?
"Because I had a run-in with Stephanie after you did, and then I had another run-in with her after Donna fired her."
She's not gonna listen to me.
"It is sexual harassment, Rachel."
I cannot have it on my record.
"Someone needs to convince her to let this go, and it needs to be a lawyer I can trust, but it also needs to be someone who's close to her level, or she's gonna feel attacked."
Then I think I have the perfect choice.
There's paint over here too.
"Doc,give me a hand with this."
Okay.
You're right.
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint,rubber tiles... oh,my God."
Playground turf.They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change,and he'Il tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
"Wait.How is it that you caught up with this guy,but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
- Surprise me.
- We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
- And Petty?
- He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means,but the turf..."
- what color was the paint?
- The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
What color was the paint?
We'll come and get you when we're done.
It's Jesse.
Just-- just please try to be careful.
Some of this stuff is really valuable.
Yeah?
Hope it's bulletproof.
"Come on, Schmidt."
Open up.
"Come on, come on, come on."
"Bad news, Sam."
"When I was picking up rounds, I paid a neighborhood kid to ride his bike by Maddy's house, just to make sure everything was okay."
He said the garden rake's propped up against the garage.
She gave the meeting signal?
Why'd she give the meeting signal?
"I don't know, Sam."
It's a rake.
It didn't come with subtitles.
"If you think someone might be following you, the temptation is to drive erratically."
"It may force the tail to reveal itself, but it also reveals you're onto them."
A better approach is to drive very conservatively.
Go below the speed limit and linger at stop signs.
"You won't win any fans on the road, but it'll help you lose your tail."
"If they think you're simply an overcautious driver, it'll catch them off guard when you suddenly take a risk."
"Oh, thank -- thank God."
I was afraid you wouldn't make it.
"Well, we, uh..."
we've been busy.
We got the signal late.
Yeah.
That's the problem with communicating by garden tools.
What's going on?
Olivia Riley paid me a visit.
"So we need to get in, get the number without her knowing about it."
How?
We need a woman.
Like Mr Ray Charles says... ..we've got a woman.
You must be joking if you think
"John, how many other birds do you know?"
We meet again.
Thanks again for everything you did to help me.
"Oh, don't just thank me."
How else would I know which hotel you'd be in?
"Which amoeba, scratching his crutch, not a million miles away, might know that you kept your private stuff hidden behind a map of the world?"
And tell Lenny when you were leaving?
"What is it you do for them again, Calum, you miserable little snitch?"
"I got used to having your big, cheery smile around."
Didn't want to see you leave.
And what do they have on you?
I'm guessing that sex with strangers in hotels wasn't really top of your career list.
It wasn't.
Advance warning.
I'm getting ready to do a runner as well.
"Well, as long as it's not in my direction, Calum."
I was once a police officer.
"I bet you looked lovely in that uniform, PC Rose."
Was Lenny your guv?
"Undercover, actually."
So do you think you can get us into the house?
"Yeah, I think I might just be up to it."
Sweet.
"Oh, that's the front door."
"Darling, I'll speak to you tomorrow."
OK?
I'm awfully sorry to disturb you.
You know he loved you like a son.
Took a hell of a lot for you to alienate him.
"Not much, just you."
"Marion, get out of here!"
Duck!
Doctor Jones.
Die herr in the bar Möchten mit ihnen Sprechen.
Kommen Sie bitte mit uns.
You're looking for me?
"Ha, ha ,ha.."
Belloq.
"Good afternoon, Dr. Jones."
I ought to kill you right now.
Not a very private place for a murder.
"Well, these Arabs don't care if we kill each other,"
They're not going to interfere in our business.
It wasn't I who brought the girl into this business.
"Please, sit down before you fall down."
We can at least behave like civilized people.
I see your taste in friends remains consistent.
"How odd that it should end this way for us, after so many stimulating encounters."
I almost regret it.
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?
Try the local sewer.
You and I are very much alike.
Archaeology is our religion.
Yet we have both fallen from the pure faith.
Our methods have not differed as much as you pretend.
I am a shadowy reflection of you.
"It would take only a nudge to make you like me, to push you out of the light."
Now you're getting nasty.
You know it's true.
"Running works, okay?"
"I learned at a very early age, you don't try to be the hero."
"Okay, I ran from bullies, I ran from cops,"
I ran from feelings.
"Okay, I have very good survival instincts."
"If it wasn't for those, I would have been moshed to death at the warped tour."
"Okay, survival instincts, yeah, all right."
What are you supposed to do when there's a tornado coming?
Run.
Where?
Away.
"No, you're supposed to go into the basement."
Wha... go to the basement?
Where the laundry is?
"What am I, gonna do a load of whites?"
"All right, well what about if there's an earthquake?"
Run.
"Again, with the running."
"You know, it's times like this where you really see someone's true colors."
Is that a song?
"No, it's a real emotion, Whitney, all right?"
"You know that we're in a relationship, right?"
"We're supposed to be together, we're supposed to be a team."
"Yes, we're on a team."
"It's called ""team stay alive."""
"Okay, teammate, can you tell me one situation where your first thought wouldn't be to run?"
I guess if I had a bomb strapped to me.
Thatwhen you'd stay with me?
"Come on, man, let it out."
What you feeling?
"Mark, I don't..."
"Dude, for the last time, don't tell me, tell her."
- In his office.
"Well, what have you got to say for yourselves?"
- We didn't get the plans.
"- Yes, go on."
"We trailed the girl, but she ran into a house occupied by a Bertie Wooster."
We waited all night but didn't see her come out.
"This morning Wooster appeared with his man, got into their car and we followed them."
"- Go on, go on."
- We stopped them on the road... posed as Scotland Yard men and searched them but they didn't have the plans.
They're coming here and that's why we hurried ahead to warn you.
"Yes, Mr. Manville?"
"If Mr. Bertie Wooster arrives, let me know immediately."
"So you followed the two men, forgot all about the girl, eh?"
"No, we left Burton there to watch the house."
He's going to have a long wait because I happen to have the lady in this hotel.
- What?
- I met her when she arrived and arranged to have lunch with her.
She thinks I'm going to help her find Mr. McDermott.
Now listen.
This is what I want you two to do.
And let there be no slipup this time.
Go to her room and make a thorough search of everything.
- We will.
- Just a moment.
And keep an eye on that Wooster fellow.
That's all.
- All right.
- I'll see you later.
"That's not bad, Jeeves."
We did the last mile in exactly one minute and 12 seconds.
"Begging your pardon, sir."
I think that's inaccurate.
- But -
"Yeah, but we've had this conversation."
Yes?
Mmm.
Why aren't you having any?
There's only enough bacon for one.
You have it.
"Hands and knees, Pat."
I'm waiting.
I'm begging you to help me.
"After you gave David the all-clear, he went down the recruitment office to find out about signing up."
"When the time comes, they'll give him a medical and if they find anything relating to asthma, they won't take him."
Tell them he's got it.
David is a young man -
- He's not a young man!
He's a boy!
A 16-year-old child.
I understand how you must be feeling.
You have two daughters who'll never see action!
You can't possibly understand how I'm feeling.
All I'm asking is you write to the recruitment office and tell them that David has a history of chronic asthma.
"But, Miriam, he doesn't."
"It's acute at best and has, thankfully, been on the wane for a number of years."
They don't need to know that!
- That's quite enough!
"With all due respect, Erica, this is between me and Dr Campbell."
Will has looked after your family for many years.
"He has great affection for you all, but you're asking him to commit a malpractice."
He can't possibly do that.
I sympathise.
I really do.
But you'll do nothing.
Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.
"You okay in there, bestie?"
I'm fine...
The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness;
the inability to pass uri...
"Yeah, I said I'm fine."
Stop talking to me.
She always this crabby when she urinates?
We're really not that close.
Screw it.
I'll go later.
And I'll be right by your side.
Did I tell you Priya invited me and Howard to have dinner with her and Leonard?
"Oh, that's nice."
"No, it's not."
It's a strategic maneuver.
Leonard's new girlfriend is testing Bernadette's loyalty to you and the group.
That bitch is crafty.
- You think?
- Of course.
How does the cheetah attack a herd of wildebeests?
By going after its weakest member.
"Well, what makes me the weakest member?"
Your trusting nature coupled with your teeny-tiny body.
You wouldn't last a minute on the Serengeti.
"Okay, Amy, you're being silly."
I'm not concerned about who hangs out with who.
And I certainly don't have a problem with Leonard's new girlfriend who wears way too much makeup.
"Ooh, these are cute."
"Of course if I buy them,"
I'll have to rent my womb out to a gay couple.
It doesn't matter.
I specifically remembered making sure that he had a cot.
"I think he made that up, I think he wanted the attention."
"He totally did, he's such a drama queen."
"- He was a trouper, though."
- I don't know how he did that...
"I think it really hurt him to sit and stuff so when he's sitting in the van, you know..."
But he never really complained.
"But look at the energy, just..."
"I mean, when I'm in agony, I don't do stuff like that, normally."
"When I'm in agony, I make sure everybody knows that I'm in agony."
Absolutely.
Rule number one.
"- Hey, I'm in agony."
- Sympathy.
- put on some pants.
- I like this tune.
"- Yeah, put on some pants."
- I like this tune.
"- Yeah, put on some pants."
"- Ari, we are adorable."
"- Shut up, there we are."
This is still all reshoot stuff.
- All reshoots.
"- Oh, my gosh."
Did you guys have to revisit anything to get back into character six months later?
- No.
- All me and Kat had to do is look deep into each other's eyes and then we were back.
All we had to do was...
"There's some creepy old men teachers, like, going in and out of the hallways."
"Remember, when we were waiting to go outside?"
That was all we needed.
"- Alexis, in that outfit, is so adorable."
You think some old guy's digging up bodies to get their medals?
"He'd know where they were buried,right?"
"- Silver stars,Korean war?"
"- Yeah,yeah."
"Look,forgotten warriors on the east grounds near the family plot."
I got to go back inside.I never wear the right clothes.
Thanks for meeting us.
Doesn't look like anything's been touched.
Maybe he got the medal from somewhere else.
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah,and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from,Warden."
"Glad you approve,son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
**********
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills,Mr.Petty.Those are mints."
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle,the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
"No, thanks."
"I had a raisin earlier and, boy, am I stuffed."
"Sabrina, you're looking awfully skinny."
"You're not still on that diet, are you?"
Me?
"No, I'm fine."
"Hey, do I see a little scalp up there?"
(gasps)
(gasps)
Don't tell me.
I've inherited the Spellman gene for a keister the size of Manhattan.
"Oh, I knew it."
It was just some sort of spell.
And yet the insecurity about my butt won't go away.
I think it's time to bring back suspenders.
"Sabrina, we have to talk."
"Oh, well, I only have a little while before Harvey picks me up for the dance and your stern lectures tend to eat up the clock."
"Not only are these things a scam, but they can cause serious side effects."
But I have to lose weight.
Like making you think you have to lose weight.
"Come here, look in the mirror."
"No, not the mirror!"
It's so cruel and unforgiving!
Not anymore.
"That creepy salesman put a spell on it, but I deactivated it."
See?
What are you talking about?
It's like looking at a picture of William Howard Taft.
"Oh, no."
All this dieting has affected you psychologically.
"You can't see that you're so thin, you're practically sick."
"Oh, well, what good is my health if I'm not Queen?"
- This dealer hasn't violated any state or federal laws?
- No.
- Hotel or Gaming Commission policies?
- I don't believe so.
"And there's no acts of moral turpitude, no guest complaints?"
What about the boss's complaints?
You have no grounds for dismissal.
And I assume I can't fire you for providing completely disagreeable advice.
I can't fire him.
Happy?
I'm so sorry.
"Well, don't celebrate too much."
I have a plan.
Can't wait.
I want you to find a cooler.
"Did you just say a ""cooler""?"
"Yeah, I just said a cooler."
Right.
"Monica, I know people talk about coolers, oh, and they made the movie, but, uh, there's no such thing as a cooler."
Did I hear someone mention a cooler?
"Hi, Monica."
Because I am one.
"Every time I go to a table, whoever's there starts to lose."
"Doesn't matter how much they were winning before, I show up, everything heads south."
It's wacky.
"Delinda, I want you to go over to that table... and stand as close to the dealer as you can get."
- I don't want to make people lose.
"- Oh, I guess I'd call it an order."
I'm just here to try to patch things up with my father.
We're not really speaking.
I work at Pure.
"Oh, my mistake."
"The posts that you're referring to,"
Raina told me about them weeks ago.
She regretted them and thought there might be consequences.
But I'm gonna tell you exactly what I told her.
Not one word of what she wrote was actionable.
So if you think you're gonna turn this into a basis of a homicide investigation...
Tendu and I had a meeting.
Two days ago.
What?
"Well, I didn't tell you 'cause I thought if an attorney was there, it might scare him away."
"We met in my office, and we made a deal."
I promised to support indigenous seal hunting if he would come out against commercial seal hunts.
Commercial hunts killing 20 times as many seals as the Inuits.
"Yeah, last thing I would want is Tendu dead or in some kind of trouble."
Can you prove any of this?
I have a draft of the agreement at my office.
We both signed it.
I can send you a copy.
You can ask other people at the meeting.
"My assistant, Tendu's girlfriend, Libena."
Libena-- that's a Czech name.
I guess so.
"I don't know, she had a thick accent."
Why?
Is that important?
(knocking)
Thanks for coming.
Of course.
You okay?
You don't look so good.

I didn't get much sleep last night.
"In here, with us."
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
"Could you help an old altar boy, Father?"
"Your mother is in here with us, Karras."
Would you like to leave a message?
I'll see that she gets it.
If that's true then you must know my mother's maiden name.
What is it?
What is it?
"Hello, Daddy?"
This is me.
Thank you.
"Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing her more harm than good."
Nothing you could do could make it any worse.
I can't do it.
I need evidence that the Church would accept as signs of possession.
Like what?
Her speaking in a language she's never known or studied.
What else?
I don't know.
I'd have to look it up.
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
There are no experts.
You probably know as much about possession as most priests.
Your daughter doesn't say she's a demon.
She says she's the devil himself.
"If you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd realize that's the same as saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte."
You asked me what I think is best for your daughter.
Six months under observation in the best hospital you can find.
"You show me Regan's double same face, same voice, everything and I'd know it wasn't Regan."
I'd know in my gut.
I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter.
You are projecting.
Which is exactly what you said when Mr. Nose Hair maxed out your credit cards and took off with the gardener.
You swore on your father's grave that you would not bring that up again.
"Desperate times, desperate measures."
Is it that guy you're seeing?
Mystery man?
- Who else?
- You need to end it with this guy.
It's not gonna get any better.
"If I could do that, don't you think I would have?"
"Laura, you have no idea."
Did you terminate a pregnancy?
How did you know that?
I know.
Did the father pressure you to do it?
Out loud?
"No, he would never."
"But, he did make it clear that if I didn't,"
I would be twisting in the wind.
"I just keep thinking about this little munchkin that I'm never gonna see and who's never gonna skin her knee, who's never gonna have her first kiss..."
I believe in a just universe.
"One of these days, he is gonna pay."
- You deserve better.
- Excuse me.
Mara?
We just got the citizen video on the DeBray killing.
Will you come help me log it?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I'll stay and go through it with you.
- The video or my trauma?
- Both.
"And then we broke up, but then we got back together again, and now she thinks that you love her more than ever."
"Oh, honey, I just wanted things... to be better between us."
By doing something completely Shady.
How could I ever trust you again?
Oh...
Honey.
"No, will."
I'm sorry.
"Well, on the plus side he's not getting married."
And you raised a son with enough character... to break up with the wrong girl... even though she has... a truly spectacular set of knockers.
"And the reason I don't have a goiter... is because as an actress, my..."
My vocal chords are so highly developed.
"Well, 's coming."
"Now, um, miss Chase, which of your parents is asian?"
What?
"Well, the disease is only carried... by people of asian descent, so-- ah."
Yes.
"Well, my father, you'll see, is asian."
"Okay, you know what?"
I just--I can't do this.
"You see, I don't really have the disease."
What?
I just said that I did because I thought... it would help me win an emmy.
"Well, that's..."
Reprehensible.
I know.
I--I feel terrible.
As you should.
"Although, in the last week, she has brought the foundation... a great deal of money and attention."
It would be nice not to share offices... with the toenail fungus people.
"Wait, what are you saying?"
"Well, um..."
I was terrible at chemistry.
I'm more of a humanities guy.
- How did you find me?
- We should talk about that.
"It should be much, much harder for people to track you down."
My PI charged me for three hours so I seriously doubt it took him more than one.
"So this is, what, blackmail?"
"Walter, I'm your lawyer."
Anything you say to me is totally privileged.
I'm not in the shakedown racket.
I'm a lawyer.
"Even drug dealers need lawyers, right?"
Especially drug dealers.
"So, what, you're just doing this out of the kindness of your heart?"
Come on.
Have you seen my hourly rate?
"By the way, where do you keep the money?"
Is it in your mattress?
Is it in a jelly jar buried in the side yard?
This kid Mayhew may be the first of your guys to get picked up but he won't be the last.
"And if I can find you, how far behind can the cops be?"
I don't understand.
What exactly are you offering to do for me?
What did Tom Hagen do for Vito Corleone?
I'm no Vito Corleone.
No shit.
"Right now, you're Fredo."
"But with some sound advice and the proper introductions, who knows?"
"I'll tell you, you've got the right product."
Anything that gets the DEA's panties in this big a bunch you're on to something special.
And I would like to be a small and silent part of it.
"Food for thought, yeah?"
Thank you.
I still can't believe that guy kept us there for no reason.
I don't know.
I think his reasons are pretty good.
"When a guy gets around a girl he's crazy about, sometimes reason goes out the window."
He forgets to take things slow.
"Well, sometimes, when a girl gets around a guy she's not too crazy about, she does some pretty stupid things, too."
I'm sorry for posting your mug shot up in the ladies' room at Taylor's birthday.
"Well, it showed a lot of creativity."
"Speaking of creativity, Caitlin... clown porn ?"
I'm not even going to ask where that came from.
I found it in Dr. Robert's study.
You guys will believe absolutely anything.
"Hey, Frank, have you ever considered cutting your hair ?"
Is that Seth ?
"Oh, my God, pull over."
"Mom, I'm really sorry I shot you."
"I know we don't always get along, but..."
I really love you.
"I love you, too."
I... don't think I've ever heard you say that before.
"Taylor, that's why I went to Julie's."
"After the earthquake happened, all I could think about was you."
"Oh, my God, Mom, me, too."
I was shot because I was such a total failure as a mother.
It never even occurred to you that I would come looking for you.
But you did.
So...
So.
Mom...
Hi.
"I guess this is the point where I'm supposed to tell you that you gave us all quite a scare, except I was never scared."
How about our favorite croupier?
"Mr. Stone was arrested when the ship docked in Miami, along with Mr. Stancati."
The cruise line is very grateful.
They even offered you all a free trip.
"If it's okay with you, Charlie, I think we'll stick to dry land for a while."
"Congratulations, angels, and, Kate, I want you to know how proud I am of you."
"Thanks, Charlie."
Interesting place to meet.
Somehow it just felt right.
How's rehab going?
- Slowly.
- You're a fighter.
"You know, I'm never going to be able to repay you."
Why did you help me?
"- Always with the questions, you."
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
"It's, uh, it's a force of habit."
"You know, I tried to tell myself that taking dirty money was just a one time thing..."
"That I could walk away, but I couldn't."
"Once your story broke, it helped me realize who I had become."
That's a first.
I have never been thanked for destroying someone's career.
"I wish I could say,"
I took those bribes because I had no choice.
"Fact is, I thought I was putting bad money to good use."
Spent it on the people I loved.
"Put my brother through school, paid my mom's mortgage..."
"Called myself a hero, but I wasn't."
"Well, to be fair, you got mixed up with a very bad crew."
I think I've got much better taste in friends now.
So this new career...
- Then you must not give up.
There's no one here with a greater love or-or knowledge of music.
And that's the key.
You must show him... that his musical career is not over.
You can't let him waste that precious talent that God has given him.
"Thank you, Father."
"""Big surprise dinner party."""
"""Spectacularly unforgettable."""
Did you ever consider renting your mouth out to the motor pool as a garage?
"Beej, if we don't come up with something soon... we're gonna be modeling the latest in tar-and-feather wear."
- Let's attack this rationally.
- I'd rather attack you irrationally.
Come on.
Think back.
You remember some special dinner party you once went to?
Sure.
Lucia Murphy's 1 4th birthday.
We played spin the bottle and sent out for Chinese food.
"Now, there's a nice touch of home."
Dinner just like Mao used to make.
"Hawk, admit it."
No matter what kind of spectacular food we come up with... as soon as it hits those tin trays on those crummy tables in that rotten tent... it's still gonna be a mess.
So we won't have it in the tent.
What can we eat outside?
- Dirt.
- No!
A picnic!
We'll have a cookout.
Wait a minute.
Wait a-
- W-W-Wait!
I just got a great idea that will save us from a lifetime of death.
Go get on your flight.
"Ma'am, get over here!"
"Why are you trying to feed infants?"""
"Anyways, that's my airport jaunt."
"If you think Jesus was white, you're not allowed to have an opinion on gun control."
Not everyone's gonna agree.
"We know now, more than ever, education's expensive."
"Also some people in the crowd are like, ""But Jesus was white."""
And you're doing the best.
I want to live like that.
I can't.
I gotta be up here.
I gotta look into it.
"All I'm saying is, if you guys want real change, you gotta limit some people's ability to vote."
I know.
I know.
I know.
It doesn't sound progressive.
Neither does genocide.
People hate genocide.
Why?
Because it's been used horrifically every single time it's been used throughout history?
That doesn't necessarily make it a bad thing.
"If I told you guys tomorrow that we were gonna round up all of the racist, homophobic people and kill them, you're telling me all the smart people wouldn't be like..."
"""Well, shit, we haven't tried that version."
"That might actually have an impact."""
Maybe it's not based on skin color or religion.
"Maybe it's just, ""Who's the dick?"
Get him out.
"Get him out of here."""
Lump in global warming deniers.
Let's clean house.
Would that I could have sustained that moment.
"Ah, no matter."
Do you have a last request?
If you think I'm going to obediently stick my head in that noose--
You still haven't learned.
You have no choice.
"Oh, this is becoming quite tiresome."
It's all so very easy.
"That's your problem, Trelane-- everything's easy."
It's given you a bad habit.
"You're not aware of it, but you have it."
"You don't think, Trelane."
That's your problem.
"You miss opportunities,"
like your anger before and mine right now.
"Oh, you enjoy it, but you couldn't have accomplished it without me, and you know why?"
"Because you're a bumbling, inept fool."
"Take care, now."
"Here you have an opportunity to experience something really unique, and you're wasting it."
You want to commit murder?
"Go ahead, but where's the sport in a simple hanging?"
The sport?
"Yes... the terror of murder, the suspense, the fun."
"Oh, I'm intrigued."
"Go ahead, Captain."
What do you suggest?
"A personal conflict between us-- not like the duel before, but the real thing."
The stakes?
A human life--mine.
Oh... yes!
Yes!
That's the idea.
"It's called grieving, Shay."
"It got embarrassing, Arlo."
"Hey, hey."
"Look, what I'm trying to say is maybe her process hasn't started yet."
Did she tell you about the postcards?
The ones her mother supposedly sent from all over the world?
"Wait, so someone was trying to pretend her Mum was still alive even though she's been dead all these years?"
"Unless Trina sent them from beyond the grave, it looks that way."
"What, like someone was trying to cover up her murder?"
"Well, there are other explanations."
"Well, yeah, but not as cool."
Some revision still might be a good idea.
"If you want, I can help."
"It's Media Studies, Arlo."
"It's not like brain science, or whatever."
You sitting an exam today?
I kind of have too.
"Well, couldn't you get a dispensation, given the circumstances?"
"Nah, I did like no work all year, so if I don't pass the exam I am sunk."
Oh.
Eggs?
Poached not fried.
Two.
"With avocado, not tomato."
"But hey, the good news is this is the last exam, so once it's over it's party time!"
Yay!
My God!
"Your mother is dead, Lindsay."
You can't just pretend it didn't happen.
Shay.
Look...
"I get that you were all totally gutted when your Mum died, but mine chose to leave us."
It's fucking amazing.
Do you know how few people reach this level?
You seem to not care.
I really don't.
Did you ask me here so you could talk about yourself?
Next question.
Does talking about this stuff make you feel happy?
No.
I find thinking about it all to be unfulfilling and exhausting.
Does nothing for me.
"Well, that's how the rest of your life is gonna be."
Unfulfilling and exhausting.
I think success has made you ugly.
"I think you've gotten far too in touch with your selfish instincts, and it's not healthy."
But I still think about you.
I think the guy I used to know would have made a really great boyfriend.
I want to take that cupcake out of your hand right now and throw it so fucking far away from you.
"Goddamn it, you make me sick."
You're just a big baby.
Babies wanna be around sugar all the time.
No wonder you're a baker.
You're the worst.
"I'm not successful, I'm notable."
There's a difference.
"Besides, I'm not notable, either."
Noteworthy at best.
I once considered you my favourite ex-girlfriend.
That's very sweet of you.
Let's...
"let's turn this day around, do something fun."
"Maybe, I don't know, break into a bank, or rob a car or something."
"- All right, let's do it."
I believe it's some kind of weapon.
A picture of my dead mother.
How come you're putting it in the box?
"Because I don't know why my dad keeps all of her pictures hidden in the attic, and tells me she looked like Grace Kelley."
Who's Grace Kelley?
"Oh, she was a very famous clown."
She was a princess.
"And, also..."
I don't know what it's like to have a mother.
We could tell you.
You can't tell somebody something like that.
Have you ever noticed that girls don't fart?
My mom farts.
Looks like a boob.
Yeah.
Make them fly around.
My boob's bigger than yours.
Let's see if you can catch my boob.
"You've got, like, a mosquito bite boob, Frank."
Why don't girls spit?
They're hiding something from us.
The rules have changed.
Gotcha.
"It's a battle of the sexes... and believe me, we are way behind."
Shit!
I can't dance.
"You see this, Frank?"
This little seedling represents an entire species of marsh grass.
"If it lives, the wetlands will survive,"
"Mortlake turtle can return to its natural habitat, and birds like the glossy ibis won't lose another precious nesting place."
"Dad, if you don't get dressed, we'll be late for school."
"Dad, if you don't get dressed, we'll be late for school."
"Is it alright then, Jon?"
Well done Catrin.
"When there's raid, I want you to go down the tube station."
I didn't bring you all the way from Wales to see you get hit by a bomb.
I saw April today.
She and Tony have made up ever such clear code.
So you can write to him about what she's doing.
'The Veg green' that means England. 'Onion Soup' is France.
There's a word for regiment and one for troop...
Oh....
"Do you really have to smoke that thing, Ambrose?"
Wouldn't you just mind?
I can mind smoking.
I can't mind smoke.
That's a cut.
I wonder would it be possible to have something to do?
My hands are aching for something to do.
And it seems alright for the character.
"Perhaps, try to find some knitting?"
Water or word.
"I fully understand the national importance of what we are shooting, and obviously, there's no question of diluting the message."
I just...
I wonder if it might impact a little more punch if Mr.Brown would express a little more.
"For example, the mention of the clever code, I might say, ""Well, that will be the first clever thing, April has ever done in her life"""
Did you...do you see?
Just a...just a dash of...of humor and then follow it on.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh!
Certainly.
Oh!
No.
Yes.
A reminder that shakpeare got it wrong.
We are not food for worms.
It's the flies and beetles that feast upon us.
"I'm more interested in why someone did this,doctor."
"Then I'll have to research the predatory, manipulative, grandiose nature of this behavior."
But my first impression is that we're dealing with a complete loon.
"That masters in psych is starting to pay off,ducky."
merciful god in heaven.
"I have seen a loof things selling real estate, but can you imagine walking in,seeing that?"
When was the last time you were here?
Yesterday morning.
First showing.
And everything was normal?
"There was no rotting corpse in the living room,if that's what you mean."
Who else had access?
A couple of dozen real este women.
The keys are in a lock box on the front door.
- Who's the owner?
- A local contractor... and me.
"Uh,I buy and bob fixes."
We split the profits.
Bob?
"Robert whitehead,the contractor."
A number where he can be reached?
Yeah.
"So who put the body here,you or bob?"
Neither of us.
Though it is an empty house.
"If you're looking to ditch a body,that's a real plus."
Jody.
I came as fast as I could.
-There are only three small onions.
-Three onions?
How many tomatoes?
-Two big cans.
-You don't need three onions.
Johnny Dio did the meat.
"We had no broiler, so he did everything in pans."
It smelled up the joint something awful and the hacks used to die but he cooked a great steak.
-How do you like yours?
-Medium rare.
Medium rare.
An aristocrat.
When you think of prison you get pictures in your mind of all those old movies with rows and rows of guys behind bars.
It wasn't like that for wiseguys.
"It wasn't bad, but I missed Jimmy, who was doing his time in Atlanta."
Give me two steaks.
"Everyone else in the joint was doing real time, all mixed together, living like pigs."
But we lived alone.
We owned the joint.
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.
They deserved it.
Even the hacks we couldn't bribe wouldn't rat on the guys that we did.
People used to be able to leave their doors open.
Sorry it took so long.
That skinny guard's a pain in the ass.
-We'll have to do something about that bastard.
-l took care of him.
What'd you bring?
Some bread.
"Vinny, I got your peppers and onions."
"Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese."
"Bumi, how did you manage to take out this entire encampment on your own?"
"I did it all with my trusty flute and... oh, never mind."
You wouldn't believe it anyway.
Let's get moving.
You run into the portal.
I'll try to hold off anyone who comes after you.
"No, you're too hurt."
You need a healer.
"Asami, can you take Oogi and my dad back to my mom?"
- Mm-hmm.
- This is my fight now.
Korra.
I love you.
"I love you too, dad."
Yipyip.
"Once we're inside, you go find Jinora."
"Mako and Bolin will take care of Unalaq while I close the portal, so Vaatu can't escape."
Wait a second.
Worst-case scenario.
"So we're fighting Unalaq, you close the portals, and let's just say something happens to you."
Are we gonna be trapped in there for eternity?
"If everything goes as planned, we'll all walk out together after harmonic convergence."
If not...
Let's go.
"Tenzin, go find Jinora."
Come on!
"You're running out of time, Raava."
I know you feel it coming.
You guys.
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady, and I-I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
"Not for any reason, I just..."
It's quite arty...
It's quite arty writing.
I wanted something different.
"I tried it in Chinese writing the other night, it looked very good."
Victoria was very impressed.
I copied it off of a Chinese menu.
"So I probably had ""fried rice"" and ""salt and pepper ribs"""
"and ""hot and sour soup"" on my arm, instead of ""Victoria""."
Aw.
He's adorable.
I don't understand.
Is that real?
Is that real?
"What do you mean, is that real?"
"I thought that was a Comic Relief spoof video, or something."
"No, that's a documentary he made back in 2000."
"Oh, my God."
"Also, he doesn't call them tattoos, he calls them arm pictures."
"Oh, my God!"
And he also had two weird square bowls with floating eggs in them.
"Yeah, he had two hard-boiled eggs in front of him."
Yeah.
In the water.
"Why, David?"
"You know those e-mails where he was asking for a effing knighthood, they were definitely doctored, because there's no way he could spell ""knighthood"", from watching that."
"It must be pretty hard, though, considering Sir Mix-A-Lot got one and he didn't."
"I don't think you should be angry about getting one, but I quite think I'd quite like to be a sir."
"I mean, I..."
Good luck with that.
"If anyone here is going to be a sir, it's going to be the king of daytime."
I bet the Queen watches Pointless.
I will.
I promise you.
"Farewell, cousin."
What is the rush?
"I pray you tell, My Lord, I will not marry yet, and when I do, I swear it shall be Romeo, whom I hate, rather than Paris, whom I despise!"
Here comes your father.
You can tell him so yourself.
My girl is like a channel.
"What, more tears?"
The level of the sea will start to lift if much more water flows from your sweet eyes.
"Wife, have you told her of her marriage plans?"
"I have, and she will have none of it, I swear."
Soft.
Soft.
"Take me with you, take me with you, wife."
How?
Will she none?
Does she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud?
"Does she not think her blessed, unworthy as she is, that we have brought so worthy a gentleman to be her groom?"
"Thankful I am, and grateful for your love, but proud I cannot be of what I hate."
"How... how-how-how, chopped logic."
What is this?
"""Proud"" and ""I thank you,"" but ""I thank you not."""
"Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds!"
"Be ready, lady, Thursday morning next, to go with Paris to St. Peter's Church"
- or I will drag thee thither on a rail!
- Are you mad?
"Good father, I beseech you on my knees."
Will you not give me leave to plead my cause?
You...
I tell you what.
"- Come on, boys, get a move on."
- You always say the people are on our side.
So why do they treat us like this?
They stare at us as if we were animals.
"To them, we're no better than the government troops."
"If I were you, I'd alter my behaviour."
Then this will change.
This stuff will give you every disease in the world.
"- Shit, I've been hit really badly."
"- Nonsense, we'll fix that."
This is madness.
Who will benefit from us blowing up the dam?
"Put him here, but carefully."
Why do we destroy bridges and farmers' houses and everything they own?
"You're an engineer, not a revolutionary."
The commandante will know why.
He might not know either.
Do you have a smoke?
"We haven't got any dressing material, but there's a hospital in San Juan."
They might cure him.
There's a priest there who knows something about medicine.
You know so much.
It's kind of you to try to help us.
"If you take me with you, I'll help you fight as well."
I always win at war games.
I'm the fastest one when it comes to climbing trees.
"At war, climbing trees is the most important thing."
"He's right with one thing, Mariá."
José has to be taken to San Juan.
You should go with him.
"Jaime, Getullio and another man will accompany you."
- But I thought...
I went up to him and told him I admired him and what he stood for and while I was thanking him he asked me if I liked stone crabs.
Halfway through dinner I had a job.
"At the end of dinner, I felt like I had a new home."
And here we go.
I hear the curve in your voice.
I've been with Pappas for 3 years and I finally found a place where you can make a difference.
"Well, you did."
You made a difference to Elaine Santos.
"You cleared Eddie's name, got their pension."
"Yeah, but not so fast."
We got to keep Wakeley on ice till I find that report.
We don't need the report.
We just take Wakeley's deposition.
"No, that's all you need."
I got to get that report see where it leads.
"What if, while you're playing detective Wakeley decides it'd be healthier to disappear?"
Then we're left with nothing.
How's Elaine supposed to feed her kids?
That's a risk we must take.
I don't need you to get Wakeley's deposition.
If you talk to him on your own you'll feel the full weight of the mayor's office upon you.
It's not a pleasant feeling.
"You're a mean prick, you know that?"
"Where I come from, that's a compliment."
Hold on a minute.
To what?
Your ambition?
John Pappas' coattails?
"Burger, fries, Coke and a lemon pudding."
I'll take these.
The mayor's boy gets the lemon pudding.
Mr. Schwartz?
Sorry.
"E, what are you doing here?"
I thought you might need some company.
I lied to my father once.
It was three months before he died.
I'd stolen his car keys and taken the car around the block even though I was only 1 4.
"Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, so help you God?"
I do.
"My dad went out the next morning, and I had parked the car a foot back from where he had, and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how he noticed that."
[Bob clears his throat]
"And, uh, this contract dated October 8th, this is for more concrete?"
"Uh, yeah."
Yes.
"And is, uh, this your signature on the bottom?"
"Yes, it is."
"Well, your signature's more illeg... ille... illegible than mine."
"So, um, isn't there usually a sales tax denoted on receipts?"
"Uh, I guess so."
Can't say I noticed.
You guess so.
You can't say.
Hmm.
Yes or no?
You're in business.
You're familiar with sales tax.
is sales tax a part of every transaction or not?
"Yes, it is."
So you or someone connected to the project broke the law here.
"Mr. Dumanjik, I'm the architect, not the contractor."
"I may have signed for delivery of materials, but I was not charged with paying the bill or handling any of the paperwork."
Did you check to see that the tax was paid?
- No.
Now I want to know who that other woman is.
We're not here to talk about that.
"Is she saying that she's engaged to Jimmy, too?"
"'Cause if that's true, he better hope he's dead, or else I'll kill him."
"James and I connected on a deep, spiritual level."
"From then on, any time he was in town, he was with me."
How often did you see him?
He would come and go a lot.
But I understood.
That's how it is with Special Ops.
Lance Corporal Finn's record does not indicate he was involved with Special Operations.
He said his missions were top secret.
"He wanted to tell me more, but he didn't want to put me in danger."
When'd you last see Lance Corporal Finn?
Six months ago.
Before he left for Iraq.
How'd you meet?
At a bar.
Two years ago.
"I was there with some girlfriends, and when I got up to go to the ladies' room, he blocked my path, said he couldn't keep his eyes off me."
And that worked?
"What worked  is that when we talked,  he had something to say."
"Most guys won't shut up about their online war games, but this guy, he had seen real action."
"And I was  feeling patriotic that night,  so I invited him to come home with me."
The sex was fantastic.
When did you two get engaged?
About a week before he left.
"James wanted to borrow $30,000."
Did he tell you what the money was for?
Gambling debts.
"And if he didn't pay, they were gonna hurt him."
Who?
-Normal?
No.
I would probably be a bit taken aback from it.
I would probably go crazy if they were here.
"I haven't the time to respond to anything, I'm going to a meeting."
That sublime expression...
It's possible to see it when they are thinking.
"When I'm thinking, you can't see anything on me."
Nothing at all.
Really.
But you are forgetting that we don't need to think.
So we can continue.
-Can I ask you a question?
-Certainly.
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
How would I react...
"Calmly, the same as to any other visit."
How fluid their walking is.
Just look.
We are not walking we are shambling.
"Yes, we are shambling."
Calm down.
They'll also be shambling.
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
I'm already too old for this.
How would you react to a visit from an extraterrestrial civilization?
Hard to say.
Thank you.
"You're from television, aren't you?"
They have questions like this.
"I don't know how I would react, you know."
Please don't put this on television.
"- Oh, no?"
- No.
- Then you lured me here...
Under false pretences.
Just a lie to get you into my room.
Cunning.
But unnecessary.
Sorry.
I might need this to replace the pretty clothes you ripped off me last night.
You work for them.
Good luck.
"So what now, John?"
"- How do you see this playing, then?"
- You tell me.
I won't go through that routine next time you run away.
Then why did you this time?
"Oh, you know I'm always curious as far as you're concerned."
- You wanted to go back to prison.
- Yeah.
I'll take my chances.
"They're not good, to be honest."
"And of course, that kind of decision has an effect on others."
"You and your sister - you were separated when your parents died, weren't you?"
You entered the chaos of the care system and Jess went to live with Aunt and Uncle.
Who raped her and called the neighbours in to hold the camcorders.
Incredible what goes on behind the net curtains in this nation of ours.
"Robert and Abi, though, they seem contented little kids."
"I'm sure they'd rather be together, with your sister."
Is he fast?
Cos I'd put money on me ripping out your windpipe before he takes a couple of steps.
"I would, too."
"That's partly the reason you're here, isn't it?"
- Your wedding?
- I'm engaged to be married.
We haven't announced it yet.
Father said it was an awful comedown for an earl's daughter to marry a mere baronet.
He was joking of course.
He didn't care about things like that.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.
Lady Carnarvon.
The carriages are ready.
Goodbye.
This is for you.
It's the terms of the concession.
My husband was very keen that you continue with your work.
"He agreed with the government that you remain in charge of the clearance of the tomb, no matter whether it remain intact or not."
- I won't let him down.
- No.
"- Goodbye, Howard."
- Goodbye.
MACE:
I think we're going to have to lift this frame up a couple of feet to get the right angle of leverage.
"Ali, Ali, can you give me the rope?"
- How's it going?
- Good.
"If you're looking at the damage, don't blame us."
They must have just banged it into position.
They don't seem to have taken much care.
It took us 12 hours to get the last one out.
We should be able to restore it.
When are you going to be ready in there?
I don't know.
There's a crack across the lid.
I like a man who can answer his own questions.
Saves me from stating the obvious.
Look after her.
- Hmm.
Fresh straw and everything.
You think he's joking.
Have you spoken to him?
"- If this is what he wants, we can't stop him."
You forgotten how old he is?
- I was a year younger.
"If you were my son, I'd have stopped you."
You wouldn't have had the option.
"Young men are drawn to war like moths to flame, Mim."
It's their chance to prove themselves.
Or be blown to pieces trying.
From a bullet or regret - more than one way to die.
"Spare me the glory of the battlefield, Bryn."
It took us years to get through it.
You still can't pour a jug with a steady hand.
"That said, I'd sooner have gone than not."
David isn't ready.
- No-one is.
You're not listening.
It's not a choice.
Not for most.
"Well, now your precious Institute's closed, perhaps I'll have your full attention."
"You've always had my full attention, Bob."
"- No, no."
Your mind is frequently elsewhere when it should be focused on ensuring that the only breadwinner in the house is looked after.
"But if you'd allow me to work,"
I could alleviate some of the financial worry.
We've had this conversation.
- She didn't mean anal.
"Should I have told you that day in People's Park... when we saw that woman arguing with a trash can, and you said:"
"""I want you to meet my mom""?"
"And we laughed, and it was funny, except that could have been my sister."
"Yeah, you feel like crap?"
"Yeah, well, welcome to my world."
Heh.
Wanna know what real guilt feels like?
"When my sister finally went to the hospital,"
I dreaded her coming home.
"It was a relief when she was gone, and we..."
We were happy.
We felt like a family again for the first time.
"- Lucy, that's not true."
- It's okay.
- Honey.
Honey.
- It's okay.
Well... at least the chicken was good.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
"If you were really sorry, you wouldn't have said that in a room that didn't have doors."
"Look, I didn't mean to be cruel."
"Yes, you did, Allie."
You've wanted to tell me that for a really long time.
Do you realize that you're furious at me for being sick?
"I mean, I guess I shouldn't be surprised."
It's a very common theme in group.
See?
Anything I feel is invalid because you are the sick one.
"Nobody ever seems to remember that when my sister who I idolized, by the way, was supposed to just be laying with me in bed, was instead using my nightgown to strangle me."
- You have to stop taking that personally.
"- Oh, my God."
- What?
Could you repeat that without the condescension?
Just say it to me like you're talking to another guy and not your six-year-old daughter?
What are you looking at him for?
I'm talking to you.
[laughs]
That what makes Goldie Goldie.
"You know, she's a straight shooter."
[chuckles] You got your spin.
"Anyway, don't worry about it."
I took care of it.
Got one of my girls to rewrite it.
You did what?
"I'm a producer, so I'm producing."
No.
"No, you don't hire writers."
"No, not without consulting me."
"Look, Marty, if I had a prick, I might stand around holding it all day, but I don't, so I have time to actually get shit done."
She'll have your pages by the weekend.
Come on.
"You know, for a woman who usually sees the big picture, that was extremely shortsighted."
I refuse to put out a mediocre product with my name on it.
I've worked long and hard to make that name mean something.
"Oh, come on, no one is disputing that."
"The problem isn't your message, it's the way you deliver it."
You kill more flies with honey.
What's wrong with a flyswatter?
You have to respect the network.
You can't treat 'em like a necessary evil.
"You ask me, they aren't all that necessary."
"Jesus, Gold."
You're not gonna break if you bend.
Good luck!
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
Angel...
"You have been blaming yourself all this time, haven't you?"
"In this world, there's no one who blames you."
Every single one of you say you don't blame me.
"But, in private, you say that Mom's death is my fault!"
"Back then, I was opposed to having the baby."
Lily was right at the peak of her career...
"At that time, she was at the prime of her modeling years."
"I can't believe that for her child, Lily was willing to sacrifice everything."
"In the end, because of a child's request, she dropped all her work, and specially flew back in order to celebrate her birthday."
"Mary, you're up."
Give Auntie a hug.
Come...
"Daddy, Mommy died because of me."
Didn't she?
Of course not.
"Why would you think that, Mary?"
Let's go.
I'll take you to get something to eat.
You can't trust what adults say.
That's not how it is at all.
Don't have such foolish thoughts.
That's definitely how it is!
That's definitely how it is!
"Even now, Dad still hates me!"
"At this time, in the script..."
Lola appears.
"She cannot hold back the tears, but gently laughs once."
Why is it disdainful laughter?
No!
That Randy's happy without me.
What am I doing?
I'm dragging you all over the country after some guy who isn't even interested in me anymore.
This is my worst idea since I told DeNiro to stick to comedy.
"So, what are you saying?"
I'm saying this is a mistake.
Let's just go home like you said after that hyena knocked you to the ground and tried to hump you.
Can I get $12 on number four?
And on which aisle can I find tucking tape?
"Okay, I will just have these Slim Jims and a Ho-Ho."
It's not like I have to fit into couture today.
- Stop hitting me.
- Stop hitting me!
"Girls, stop fighting."
I hate to see women fighting each other.
"Well, unless, of course, it's Hoda and Kathie Lee over the last glass of chardonnay."
That's RuPaul!
From RuPaul's Drag Race!
We love your show.
We used to watch it through our neighbor Jeff's window.
"But then he met Dean, and now all they do is cook naked."
So we just watch that now.
"Oh, you poor babies."
"So, why the cat fight?"
Did she steal your size 12 stilettos?
'Cause I would cut a bitch for that.
We were actually on our way to Texas to see if she and her ex could patch things us.
"No, we're not going to Texas."
We're going back home.
Sometimes you got to admit defeat... and that there is a very live junebug in this macaroni salad.
"Oh, no, honey."
Oh!
That's kind of devious.
"They might have, who knows?"
Were you in any kind of position where you could pretend that you weren't having sex?
Let's see.
You tell me.
"Johnny, tell me about the Catholic newsletter than you inadvertently subscribed to."
You don't have to.
We were having such a fun time.
You don't have to if you don't want to.
Very religious household.
Three brothers.
"My dad, the only man who never actually had any porn in the house."
We went into other people's houses and their dad had a stash.
It was almost like being a dad meant having a stash.
"In the '70s, definitely."
"Inside the bath, the bath's plastic panels."
There you go.
"Mayfair, that sort of thing."
In the shed.
I could literally give you a tour of Carlisle of where all the porn was.
"I was a little girl, you know."
Cos there's nothing else to do.
It would be in a hedge.
"I used to walk dogs for the neighbours and walk round, because blokes who got rid of it hastily would throw it across the field."
Why is it always in a hedge?
Always in a hedge.
Porn would find you.
I feel sad now walking my dog.
There's no porn anywhere.
"You always think, ""Oh, God!"""
A badger attacks you.
Told you he thought you were cute.
"Couple drinks, one thing leads to another, you're heading out to the alley to go do the fairly obvious and, before you know it he's punching you, he's kicking you, he's all over you."
"Okay, I didn't meet him at the bar."
But I had seen him before.
I kept running into him outside the courthouse and I was like...
Outside the courthouse?
"Yeah, he'd be across the street at that coffee place."
I just thought it was his spot.
And he was big and muscly and like every gay man's fantasy.
I just couldn't believe that he was actually talking to me.
You know?
"So we started talking, and I told him that I was on the jury."
"I know I shouldn't have, but I just was trying to impress him or whatever."
And then he smiled at me this big seductive smile.
And he threatened me not to tell anyone.
So you lied to the police?
"- No, I was just..."
I was scared that he...
"- Did you happen to tell him, which way you were leaning, guilty or innocent?"
"Yeah, I told him innocent."
Okay.
"Kyle, we have to take this to the police."
It could change the whole outcome...
"- No way, man."
Are you fucking kidding me?
He's gonna kill me this time.
No.
Please.
"- Okay, okay, okay."
What do you have on tap?
First gay bar?
Newcastle.
Wu-tang originated from Shaolin.
They are so ambitious as to compete with us.
The Highness will be the host of this competition.
Then please send me!
That's what's in my mind.
But we still have to get our chief's approval.
Tat-chi has only been with us for a short time.
He's still got a lot to learn.
How can he be our representative?
"Please decide, Chief!"
Why do you propose that Tat-chi fight?
"Although he has a short history with us, he has great potential and a firm foundation."
He would make an ideal representative.
Only a senior student can represent our temple.
How is your sole testimony supposed to sway me?
I don't think we should let seniority decide.
"Then since you must continue to insist,"
I would like to test him!
You don't have to argue anymore then.
Yes!
"Tat-chi, would you like to compete with Fat-chi?"
I'm willing to accept it!
Tat-chi!
You must do your best!
Please excuse me then!
Very nice!
"Fat-chi, excuse me!"
"Tat-chi, your strikes still cannot demonstrate a sure win."
Try your Chin Kang Fist now.
Let's see how you do with that.
Tat-chi!
Tat-chi!
And this is my personal safety device.
"It's a flashlight, it's a radio, it's a cell phone charger, it's a siren and it's a compass."
Hmm.
North is that way.
Handy.
"Also got canned goods, batteries, water, ooh, a gas mask and-- that's right..."
"North Korean currency, because you just never know."
"Hey, why are you wearing a jacket ?"
Are you cold ?
Let me get my space blanket.
It preserves up to 80% body heat.
A bit of bad news just in.
Our first fatality.
"Not a lot of information, a pedestrian hit by a downed power li..."
No reason to think its anyone we know.
"Yeah, of course not."
"Still, aren't families supposed to reach out to each other in times of uncertainty ?"
"I know the phones are messed up, but you were able to get through to Sandy and he was able to get through to Seth."
"Uh, right, you're worried about your mom."
Yeah.
She gave birth to me.
"If I'm worried she may be hurt, then shouldn't she be worried about me ?"
I think we need to go over there and check on her.
To her house ?
"Yes, Ryan."
"I know my mom is a total bitch, but she's still my mom, and she doesn't drink a lot of milk so her bones are probably very brittle and she's always been kind of scared of the dark..."
"Taylor, Taylor, we can't go over there."
Seth and Summer are coming over here.
What ?
Since when ?
Since Seth texted me.
He said that they were.
"That's what I say too, but you don't believe me."
"You're just lying to yourself, aren't you?"
You'll never know for sure whether your dad really wrote those messages.
I know!
I just know!
What's going on here?
Will the show continue?
Don't know...
You just know?
What basis do you have for saying you know?
Do you think you know your dad very well?
Back to the script.
Gong Xi is going back to Lola's lines.
She's acting again.
Yes.
She's back to Lola's lines again.
You've never had a proper conversation with your dad.
"All day and night, you just complain that Dad doesn't care about you."
You never try to be understanding of his feelings.
Isn't that true?
"Mary, how was your day at school?"
Did you play any fun games with your classmates?
Why does he ask the same question every time?
Lame.
"Bit nippy, but this time of year, what do you expect?"
"And as your daughter said, no-one really knows what's gonna happen."
You don't have to do this any more.
You can live instead.
Daddy!
You've been found guilty by a unanimous verdict.
"The law says you should be punished, but we don't have the resources to impose a custodial sentence."
"Therefore, I have no choice but to pass a sentence of death."
Mama knows you're hiding things from her.
"Leena, this isn't the right time."
When is right time?
The child is around and we can't say a word.
"Mama, why don't we talk later about the theatrical swamp?"
"Sure, stick your head in the sand."
What are you hinting at?
"I'm just saying that for the past months you come here and talk about everything aside from ""the matter""."
"- I already told you about ""the matter""."
"I told you when it was in the papers, I told about the police."
I don't sleep at night and friends is a term that doesn't exist anymore!
"Is that ""the matter"" for you?"
I understand you're talking about me.
We're talking about this whole family.
"A family with a big blemish, like cancer."
"Yitzhak is not a thief, do you understand?"
"I read the papers, they're investigating, there will be a trial, it could end badly."
And please don't smoke in the living room!
He had no choice but to write out fake invoices.
The theater wasn't paying him.
He was supposed to get percentages on ticket sales.
And it was a musical.
A grand operetta.
Who says they owe him a bonus?
He took what was coming to him!
Not honestly.
Fictitiously.
But we don't talk about that anymore.
We keep quiet here.
I don't keep quiet.
I'll tell those who need to know.
Not you.
- Just checking.
"- No doors, people."
You have no idea what it is like growing up in this house.
- I'm not saying I do.
- Know why that poster is still on the wall?
Because my life stopped when I was 12 years old and it did not start back up again until a year ago.
"Since the first time Lucy got sick, everything has been about her."
Doors!
You wanna know what's funny?
It was about her before then too.
She was the smart one.
She was the pretty one.
She was the star of the family.
"Apparently, that was not enough for her, because then she got sick."
And she dominated every moment of our lives.
- Everything else was just put on hold.
"- Okay, I can't listen anymore."
- I'm going upstairs.
"- No, Mom."
"No, I wanna hear this."
- I wanna hear the unvarnished truth.
- I like my truth with a little varnish.
Know what it's like to postpone your birthday because your sister sees giant rats running across the floor?
"Or to have your parents so distracted all the time that they can barely get through the day, let alone find the energy to come to your stupid soccer game?"
"If Lucy had a bad day my mom wouldn't get out of bed for the next two days or weeks, depending on how bad it was."
I'm really sorry you had to go through all that.
- I wish you had told me.
- On our first date?
Or second?
How about the first time we did it from behind?
- When she says that...
Just...
"I promised him, no plums in the basket."
Okay.
I made room for some of Mike's stuff in the hall closet.
I'm gonna take these things over to goodwill.
Don't you dare.
Those are your dad's clothes.
You can't give those away.
"Mom, he died 25 years ago, and this leisure suit passed away ten years before that."
I don't care.
You're not giving them away.
"Oh, it still smells like daddy."
Hai karate and hot sauce.
It's gonna be so weird having another man living here.
"By the way, I was wondering if you guys could clear a little space for him in the bathroom."
"Ooh, that big man in our little bathroom?"
Yipes.
Don't worry.
"All he's got is a razor and a toothbrush, and for some mysterious reason, a shower cap."
It's not about counter space.
We're worried about the beating that toilet's gonna take.
Mom.
Why don't we make him use the downstairs bathroom like we did with dad?
There you go.
"Just throw in a good, industrial-strength plunger and a big scented candle."
"Citronella, like they use at campsites."
Or we could just rent one of those porta potties and put it in the backyard.
Good idea.
Then it becomes the neighbor's problem.
"All right, this is the last of it."
We got a dreamsicle and what is either a frozen tamale or a pair of yellow dress socks.
I will have the dreamsicle.
I'll spin the wheel on that tamale.
He has gone with him.
"Chun-tae, listen carefully."
"When we land, I'm going to make a run for it while Yum Moon is attacking Buryung."
"But if we get caught, we're dead."
Why would we get caught?
I just don't have a good feeling about this.
Jang Bogo will kill us at this rate.
The best plan is to run away.
Got that?
Are we going to work for Madam Jami?
We can decide that later.
- Got that?
"- Yes, sir."
Chief Jang.
Yes.
I have never disobeyed the master until now.
I know.
You would obey his orders even if they led you to your death.
I still remember the time you jumped off a cliff without a word when the master ordered you to.
"At the time, I couldn't understand why the master was so cruel to you."
"But with time, I've learned how much he cares for you."
It bothers me that I've disobeyed him.
But I am doing this for him.
We will self-destruct at this rate.
He will understand my loyalty for him when we return with provisions and weapons from our attack on Buryung.
You'd better answer my questions truthfully.
Then your life will be spared.
Yes.
Where are Yi Do-hyung and Yum Moon now?
"Master is on the ship, and the head chief is not on the island."
Then where has he gone?
He's gone to secure provisions and weapons.
"The Escape""... at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Southern California."
The theme park ride is the stage... for a spectacular free-fall demonstration.
It will showwhat happens when a carfull of people... and a tennis ball fall from 415 feet in the air.
Okay.
Here we go.
All right.
"Oh, my."
"Oh, my God."
The riders are shot up the 41-story-tall tower... at a hundred miles an hour.
"With their eyes open, gravity will help them see a superhero."
"Oh, my God."
Okay.
I'm going to drop this ball now and--
"Oh, my God, it's floating around!"
It's floating!
It's floating!
"Oh, the wind blew the ball away that time."
"While we expect all objects to fall freely together, regardless of mass... on a windy day, results aren't always perfect."
All right.
"Oh, my God."
"At the very top of the ride, when upward motion has stopped... gravity takes over and the downward free fall begins."
I'm going to drop this ball... and it's going to float.
It's going to float.
"Oh, it's floating."
It's floating.
I'm going to release this ball now.
"And then, for a few blissful seconds... theme park thrill-seekers feel weightless... as ifthey are free of gravity, or in what scientists call zero-G."
"Oh, that one floated well."
That one floated well.
"Oh, I'm going to try dropping the ball."
But zero-G isjust an illusion.
"In reality, gravity is running this ride."
Jimmy had never asked me to whack somebody before.
But now he's asking me to go to Florida and do a hit with Anthony.
That's when I knew I would never have come back from Florida alive.
"Whenever you move me, I asked once and I'll tell you again"
I don't want to go any place cold.
You don't have a choice in that matter.
Come on.
Just whoever fucking controls it... just no place cold.
Do that for me.
I'm trying to...
"He's bronchial, that's why."
"If he's legitimately bronchial, we'll take it to consideration."
I'd like to go someplace not cold.
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?
What about them?
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?
Don't I have some kind of contact with them?
No.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that
"God forbid, something happens to my parents they get sick, I can't going see them?"
"Maybe something can be worked out, if they're sick if there's extraordinary circumstances..."
I can't do this.
"I can't do this, Henry."
I can't leave my parents.
"Excuse me, Karen, I told you before."
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
I can't do it without you.
"So, you do whatever, but... that's it."
You?
You created Poopie Penguin?
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
What's Poopie Penguin?
That's right.
What's Poopie Penguin?
What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?
"Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points."
Penguins don't fly.
No.
They do in my universe.
"Let me explain something to you, my kids, Charlie and Grace, they play this game non-stop."
Must have spent $100 on it just last month.
"Yeah, that's the beauty of in-app purchases."
"Yeah, I don't think there is anything beautiful about it."
I think that it is a scam.
You're ripping off children is what you're doing.
"I mean, you give them the app for free, and then they got to pay if they want to keep playing for the power-ups and the boosts or whatever you call it."
You're like a drug dealer pushing dope.
"First taste is free, then they're hooked for life."
"Don't hate the player, hate the game."
"I hate the game, I do very much."
Would you please stop and let him focus?
He needs to focus.
This is important.
(sighs)
"I'm just curious, how do you think of something like that anyway?"
"Ah, simple."
"A, poop is funny."
I'll give you that.
"B, it's relatable, everybody poops."
The groom isn't supposed to see the bride on the wedding day.
"Well, we have a few details to work out."
"Nothing that can't wait, I hope."
-Dr.
Rasgotra's scrubbing in on this.
-l am?
Yeah.
You did that open lap in the street.
I think I can trust you in a sterile operating room.
"You're not getting cold feet, are you?"
We'll talk later.
Are his vaccinations up-to-date?
His pediatrician and I don't believe in them.
Immunizations are probably one of the most successful...
... publichealthinterventions ever developed.
"Thank you, but it's a personal decision."
Did you know the air has 21 percent oxygen in it?
He's studying the atmosphere in school.
"Well, that's very cool."
"He's sitting at 94, which is low, but nothing dangerous."
It probably has to do with the fluid I heard in his lungs.
"I'd like to get a chest x-ray, which is nothing scary."
It's just a special kind of photograph and it doesn't hurt at all.
My uncle Deaver had one of those and we got to see all his bones.
Mm-hm.
"-l don't want x-rays, if possible."
"Mrs. Kenig, I'm pretty sure Stewy has pneumonia."
"Well, can't you just treat it then, and we can avoid the radiation?"
"Well, it's a small amount. lt just helps us have a look at what we're dealing with."
-Glenda's waking up.
-Thank you.
Wouldn't you go with antibiotics anyway?
"But, you have come very far."
How did you think that I would leave you?
"How much was I hit by small boss, because of this fellow?"
He should not be alive now sir.
I'm the one who should kill him.
Correct sir.
Kill him till you relieve your anger.
The whole magazine should be emptied.
Today is no enemy day for us.
No enemy will be left for us henceforth.
How is that sir?
Vasundhara with son and daughter-in-law would land in Aurangabad and leave to Shiridi by road.

Why are you tensed?
I am not getting the signal when I am trying to speak to Karthi.
Even my phone is not working.
It is surprising.
"You are thinking who I am, right?"
I am son of Jayaraj.
I am Jayaraj's son.
My dad i.e your husband has planned to kill you all.
"My men can do that work, but do you know why did I involve?"
Because of you I lost the identity as Jayaraj's son for 25 years.
I will not just take my revenge by killing you all now.
I will become the King of your entire empire.

Are you still alive?
"Due to the shock I give, both you and your father.."
The pasta carrots?
"I know there is a glitch with my copter, too, but at least I had it under control."
A glitch is one thing but I saw...
"Kade, Dani, Graham, you guys did great work today."
Can I be excused?
"Optimus or no Optimus, I don't know how long I can put up with this..."

"Others taking the credits, having to pretend we're tin cans."
"What, did you see the way my partner pilots me?"
My controls are still sore.
"It's always higher, higher, faster, faster."
"Still, it was nice being a part of emergency response again."
I find our Chief quite competent.
There's much he can teach us about this law enforcement procedures.
The humans do have strange ways.
But that's what makes them so interesting.
I'm leaving.
You can't leave.
You're our leader.
"Then, we'll all go."
Those humans will never understand us.
We'll never belong here.
I know what you mean.
Don't bother.
You're not fooling anybody.
Trust me.
"Living in Griffin Rock,"
I know robots and you guys...
worst robots I've ever seen.
We failed in our mission.
Our cover is blown.
"If this human knows, he'll tell the others."
I wanna kiss you more than anyone in the world.
I wanna kiss you 1000 times.
I never wanna stop.
That's pretty good.
I'll give you one kiss.
What would Allison say?
Why bring her name up at a time like this?
Only one kiss to a customer.
"Betty, I couldn't help it."
My father made me call you.
Wouldn't you rather be with me?
"- Oh, yes, yes."
- Tell me how much.
"In the whole world, in the whole wide world there's nobody I'd rather be with than you, Betty."
Give me another kiss.
"Oh, honey, honey."
- You want to make love to me?
"- Yes, yes, of course I want to."
Now go make love to Allison MacKenzie!
Go get the girl you brought and try it with her.
"The next time I go out, it will be with a man, not a papa's boy!"
Ladies and gentlemen.
"Pupils and faculty of Peyton Place High School, and especially the seniors."
"They tell me it is a tradition here to end each graduation dance with ""Auld Lang Syne. """
Since I'm new here and not yet part of your traditions I think the song should be led by a woman who has been with you long.
Ms. Elsie Thornton.
"Thank you, Mr. Rossi."
We're a small spot in a small town on a great big map.
And maybe Peyton Place High School isn't a name that shakes the world but it's a part of each of you forever.
Make it great by honoring it and come back to see us whenever you can.
Now let's form a big circle everyone holding hands.
"It's an odd feeling, being in a school when it's so quiet."
Or maybe it was the day before that.
"No, I didn't pick up, what for?"
"The end means the end, it's pathetic."
What were you expecting?
Just forget about it.
"Yeah, forget about it and leave me alone."
You bother me about it everyday.
"I'm going to have to change my number, not because of him but because of you."
I can't not pick up your calls.
Maybe you don't want to cut yourself off from him completely.
Right?
"Fine, I'll change it."
Has Young Soo's movie made its premiere?
I thought it was supposed to be released around this time.
It premiered about a week ago.
Really?
That bastard was born to throw my money down the drain.
What's with the 'bastard'?
What of it?
You don't call your own child a bastard.
Mothers use it to refer to their children.
Why are you picking a fight?
Even my mother called me a bastard.
Is something causing you pain?
- Me?
- Yeah.
"Why do you look so glum, as if you've eaten something rotten."
And you haven't said one word unless it was in answer to something.
"He has no reason to gossip with you at a place like this,"
- why are you being like this?
- Why are you being like this?
You look uncomfortable.
None of it's working.
"I had this guy leave me a voicemail at work, so I called him at home."
"And then he e-mailed me to my BlackBerry, and so I texted to his cell."
Then he e-mailed me to my home account and the whole thing just got out of control.
And I miss the days where you had one phone number and one answering machine.
And that one answering machine housed one cassette tape and that one cassette tape either had a message from the guy or it didn't.
And now you have to go around checking all these different portals just to get rejected by seven different technologies.
It's exhausting.
What about that MySpace guy?
- Jude.
I like him.
- Good.
"Yeah, I felt like we connected."
Great.
What if she wants you to kiss her?
"Well, then I guess I'm just gonna have to kiss her."

This babe has plenty of battle scars.
Hello?
"Oh, hey, you're home."
Where am I supposed to be?
"Out, maybe?"
It's Saturday night.
You won't let me go out with guys who don't like me.
It's kind of limiting.
Right.
"Listen, I was just gonna leave a message."
I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come.
"Oh, I don't know."
Won't Conor be there?
"There's a full tactical support team on-site, and some heavy-hitter seems to be running the show."
We got them boxed in.
"Whatever it takes, I want it finished."
We have Westen.
Awaiting instructions.
Stand down and let him go.
Please confirm stand-down.
Confirmed.
All units stand down.
"I'll never stop, Westen."
I'll hunt you down to the ends of the earth if I have to.
Then I'll see you there.
"When you're a fugitive, it's tempting to flee the country and worry about the details later."

Randy Weems?
What the hell kind of name is that?
What happened to Chuck Finley?
That's my lucky name.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Weems, but my I.D. guy doesn't take requests."
"Oh, crap."
"Well, just stick with ""Sam,"" will you?"
Don't be calling me Randy until we leave.
"Speaking of leaving, shouldn't Elsa be here with the supplies already?"
Michael and Jesse are almost done with the radio.
Don't worry.
She'll be here.
I just gave her a few extra things to pick up for me.
She probably just got stuck shopping.
"""A few extra things""?"
You are now looking at the new colonel of the ninth regiment.
"And this time, the uniform is going to be the genuine article."
"Where'd you get it, jim?"
Are they selling commissions now?
"No, of course not."
I just paid the regiment's deficit and told the militia boys i'd get them a job on the railroad.
"Work is the crying need of today, luke."
"And besides, they're a nice, tough bunch of boys to have around in case of trouble."
Now you go out and get them a job on the erie.
The whole regiment?
Yeah.
"Go ahead, go ahead."
"You know, i feel just like an actor having my uniform made in theater."
What's the matter with this waistline?
"It sticks out a bit, don't it?"
"Only sticks out where you stick out, boss."
"Say, what goes with these suits?"
A bass drum or a bugle?
"Say, i want a shiny sword, too."
"But you only carry a sword while on parade, mr."
Fisk.
It doesn't make any difference.
"Even if it don't cut cheese, i'm not gonna fight with it, anyway."
One shiny sword.
"- Yes, sir."
And put a big hunk of gold on the handle.
"Yes, sir."
"You know, i always did like a uniform."
"Me, too."
You could make me a dozen uniforms like this.
"Here's josephine, napoleon."
"Well, do i pass inspection?"
Everyone seems to be leaving me.
Home was my haven.
Now everything there just reminds me of everything not there.
Chuck.
"I mean, Charlotte."
Her room is how she left it.
"Clothes in the closet, her books on the shelves."
"Her special pillow, still at the head of the bed."
I didn't know she had a special pillow.
It was her father's.
"I'm sure it's teeming with fungus and microscopic bugs that feed on flakes of human skin, but she was fond of it."
"I know you loved having Charlotte safe at home smiling on the other side of the room, but she's gone."
She's moved out.
Hm?
I mean on.
She's moved on.
Maybe it's time for you to move on and get rid of that pillow.
As the Pie-Maker considered Chuck's worldly belongings  and how Vivian clinged to them  Olive was clinging to her own.
"Uh, excuse me."
Mother Superior.
Hi.
I have been here for a day and was told the porter would come for my things.
- Do I need to tell him what room I'm in?
"- The poor, sister."
The poor will come for your belongings.
Part of your vow of poverty?
I thought that was a temporary vow since I'm only gonna be a temporary nun.
Don't you have some kind of storage facility?
This is your home for as long as you're here.
"And as long as you're here, you will live as a nun."
But I like my belongings.
That's why they belong to me.
"What about if she comes after my mom, my brother..."
Doug's son Jasper?
- So we sit here and wait?
"- For once, she's right, Mike."
We gotta do somethin'.
"We're gonna hand him over to the U.S. Attorney,get him into Witness Protection."
- Won't she still come after you?
- We'll deal with that later.
"Sam, I need you to call the U.S. Attorney."
Tell them we're bringing Doug in tomorrow morning.
- I'm on it.
"- And, uh... somebody needs to go to my mom... see that she's safe, make her house secure."
- Think she's cooked dinner yet?
"- I'm sure she'll heat somethin' up for you, Sam."
"Well, then I'm on that too."
Fi...
I need you to prep an armed escort.
Doug.
I need you... to stay away from the windows.
You say this is just a precaution?
"Oh, yeah."
It's nothin' to worry about.
"Um, say, um, this is a little embarrassing, but, uh... me and my lady friend, uh, had a falling out, and... well, Mike thought maybe it would be okay if I, uh, crashed here for the night."
"Sam, I'm not an idiot."
You want to tell me what's goin' on?
"Well, see, there was this lady, and she was making some threats."
- Against me?
- Not specifically.
"Well, I mean, your name came up, but it was more like a hypothetical type thing... so it's nothing to worry about, but Mike wanted me to stay here and give you some... you know, self-defense pointers in case I had to leave."
You gonna leave this here with me when you go?
Okay.
"Be careful, okay?"
She's mad.
She saw us together last night.
I'll talk to her.
Explain to her how bored out of my skull I was listening to you and my dad talk about dead writers all night.
You okay?
You just seemed kind of weird when your dad called me over.
"He had just told me about this horrid job he's taken in New Zealand, so he's gonna be gone for like ever now."
"Well, did you tell him not to?"
"When we spoke on the phone, you told me it was crucial that you speak to Julia in person."
"Yes, and I changed my mind."
I-I spoke to her over the phone.
About what?
About Kelly's disappearance.
I asked her if she would check Alan's cell phone and see if there were any recently made calls.
And?
She wouldn't do it.
"You don't take no for an answer, Sherry."
What aren't you telling me?
"Nothing, David, I swear."
What have you been up to since we last talked if you weren't at Milliken's?
Making calls.
You could have made them from here.
"Yes, but I didn't."
"I parked on the side of the road,"
I started making calls because I didn't want to wait.
I told you we have a small window of opportunity here.
I wanted to exploit the fact that Milliken may not have had time to cover his tracks when he had someone grab Kelly.
All right.
I have other things to attend to.
Okay.
Is there anything else?
That's it.
But it was over.
"That I explained everything to you, and you believed it."
Did Drew believe it?
"I think so, yes."
What if he told someone else?
I think we should wait until we're sure.
You need to finish mixing the explosive.
My brother says we could be activated at any time.
"If we get the code, we must be ready to go."
Are you there?
I got to go.
Carter this is crazy.
You'll never get out of there alive.
"Just tell me if the money is at the police station, Rebecca."
Your source is right.
"Metro pd made a drug bust in southeast d.C., recovered a little over $4.6 million in cash."
Can you tell me where the evidence lockers are?
"Yes, first floor, next to dispatch, but they're covered by two surveillance cameras."
"But I'll hack in and put them in a loop, create a blind spot."
You can do that?
Welcome to our world.
"Before you do anything, give us some time"
To see if we can find the leak.
How long is that going to take?
"20 minutes, 30 tops."
"No, no, it's too long, okay."
Grimes is expecting this money in half an hour.
Then we'll bring CTU into this.
Take our chances Mullins isn't the leak.
We can't take that chance rebe...
"Listen... everything that's happening, it's on me."
"Eric, that's not true."
"Promise you won't mention it again, or even think about it!"
- Promise me!
- Why?
"If you say that to anyone else, you'll be in big trouble, and I won't be there to help you."
"If it'll make you happier, I promise."
- However much we like her...
- Do you like her too?
"Of course, how couldn't I?"
She likes you too.
"Benigno, Alicia is practically dead!"
"She can't feel anything for anybody, not for you, not for me, not even for herself!"
Get that into your head!
Our patient Alicia Roncero has been raped and is pregnant.
I haven't told her father yet because first you're going to tell me what bastard did that in my clinic.
"Sir, we all feel extremely concerned."
You should be feeling responsible.
Alicia was on your floor.
Then let me be the one to explain the situation.
"Rosa, please..."
Alicia's periods stopped two months ago.
"At first, I thought it was only one month but I was mistaken."
That isn't mentioned in last month's report.
"In fact, it says you put the towel on her as always."
That week I was off again with the flu.
"You wrote it, didn't you, Benigno?"
It's your writing.
"Yes, it was me."
Why did you falsify the notes?
I didn't want to cause any alarm.
It isn't the first time a patient's periods have stopped.
That's true.
Why did no one notice?
- I'd rather not.
It's late for Buddy and I ought to finish these socks.
"Come on, Frank, you and Ruth can chaperon us."
Lay off.
I told you I don't wanna go.
What are you gonna do?
Stay and make faces at yourself all night?
Will you go on to the movies and let me alone?
Come on.
No job's worth eating your heart out.
"But it was my job, wasn't it?"
You said so.
"I said so, but the company didn't."
They got their own ideas.
Where did they get the idea Dombrowski was so hot?
"Well, he invented that oiling system that they're using now."
He's saving them dough.
They figure that a guy who could do that could save them in other ways.
He's got his nose in a book and going to school while we lay around and listen to radio.
You gotta hand it to him.
"They've already handed it to him, ain't they?"
I suppose if I went around showing off reading books they'd make me president of the company.
"If you wanna be a sorehead, forget it."
Sorehead?
Sure I'm a sorehead.
Ain't I got a right to be?
How would you like it if you'd been counting on a break sure you was gonna get it and all you got was laughed at just because some guy's been sucking around the boss?
- Yeah?
"- Hello, Mr. Taylor."
This is Jenkins of the Zenith Auto Sales Company.
I showed you the car this afternoon.
"Well, forget it."
- That's why they stopped and searched me on the road.
- They told me all about you.
- That must have been most interesting.
Most instructive.
I saw the same two in your room when you were having lunch.
- You did?
Why didn't you stop them?
- I thought it over.
One can't monkey about with Scotland Yard men.
I tried to tell you while you were having lunch but you fortunately stopped me.
Why was that fortunate?
Because the man you were having lunch with was another government chap.
He threatened to shoot me if I so much as look at you.
Thank you for telling me this.
"And, now, if you'll excuse me, I won't keep you any longer."
I'm in no hurry.
I haven't come to the most important thing yet.
Don't tell me there are more detectives on my trail.
"There probably are, hundreds."
"Black with them, for all I know."
I must give you one word of advice.
Will you give back those plans?
Get whatever it is you've stolen... and we'll trickle down together and just see those detectives.
- You're out of your mind.
- I'm not.
"I just love you, that's all."
"In fact, if you'll reform, I'll willingly consider marrying you."
- I suppose I should feel flattered.
- You certainly should.
I don't propose to every girl I meet.
Now put on your coat.
- Please leave my coat alone.
"I'm Helen, I'm a taxonomist from London."
Welcome back.
"You've both lost a game, won a game, and now it's your chance to get through to the semifinal."
"Marianne, what's with the hat?"
I've just got a massive collection of hats.
I just really like hats.
"I suppose when you're looking down at your hive, it'll look like you're looking up with your eyes, is that the idea?"
Yeah.
"And you've got an owl in your top, Helen - is this for wisdom?"
We hope so.
We hope so!
"Well, let's see, because you're playing for a place in the semifinals."
We want lots of wisdom.
Best of luck to you both.
Let's play Hive Minds.
All the answers are hidden in a hive which looks like this.
"And if the answer to my question was,"
"""What are the names of this week's teams?"", you'd be looking for..."
"And as you can see, answers use adjoining cells, can go in any direction."
And no cell is used more than once.
"In round one, as you are looking for answers, after two seconds, letters start to disappear, and as they do, the points go down."
"So the faster you answer, the more you score."
"Be careful - we've laid a few false trails, we've set a few traps."
"So, Lutrophiles, here's your first question."
Buzz in when you think you've found the answer.
Reveal the hive.
Grimsby.
Or...
Is Grimsby there?
"Ooh, I'm not sure it is."
No.
What else is there?
"Oh, then you approve?"
"Yes, but... you can do better than that."
There's still not enough sport in killing me with a sword.
I know.
That will be dull.
We'll have to have something more fanciful.
"Let me see... a hunt, a royal hunt-- predator against predator."
"Now, you may go hide in the forest-- anywhere you like-- and I shall seek."
"How does that strike you, Captain?"
"It strikes me... very well... but you'll have to make it worth my while, Trelane."
Why not up the stakes?
The stakes?
Yes.
"While we're playing our game, free my ship."
Let it continue on its way.
"In return,"
I'll give you a contest you'll remember.
Always back to your ship.
"Oh, well... if it will add spice to the pursuit..."
"I accept your terms, Captain."
"[ Trelane ] Remember, you must try not to let me find you too quickly."
Let me notify the Enterprise that it can go.
At your convenience.
Enterprise...
"Enterprise, this is Kirk."
Can you hear me?
[ Static ]
Get the ship away as fast as you can.
I'll try and give you the time you need.
Can you hear me?
Aha!
Enterprise...
I don't think I ever closed my mouth in this movie.
It's hard not to laugh when you're standing next to me with your mouth open like that.
It's such a good choice though.
"This is the first thing we shot on the movie, this performance."
- That's right.
- The second thing was this scene...
And then Rafi normally comes down and kisses a guy.
It just cuts away right when it happens.
And that guy was so excited.
He had to kiss that guy and it didn't make it in.
- They kissed a lot.
- That guy was so excited when...
We couldn't stop them from kissing after a certain point.
"Mike, I love your face when you do that."
Your were so pissed.
I like the Jerk Offs sign in the back.
That's Lite-Brites.
Those were some of my favorite things.
"Dave Doernberg, our production designer, dug out the Lite-Brite."
- I love Lite-Brite.
- He doesn't do that for every motion picture he works on.
This is the first thing of our friendship that we ever filmed.
Yeah.
"Watching this scene, like, this is where we all got to know each other."
This is where l...
I hadn't ever met Jonny or seen him in anything.
And he didn't say a word in this sequence.
"He's standing in the crowd staring at Rafi, but I learned so much about him just watching him from the stage."
"- But you met him at rehearsals, right?"
"Yeah, I mean..."
"But still, you know, it was kind of..."
We were just acquainted.
It is feasible.
I know that wasp venom has a pheromone in it that signals other members of the hive to attack.
Of course one question still stands.
"If this is a pheromone, then how did it get into their bloodstreams?"
Are you kidding me?
People will try anything if they think it's going to get them high.
"Remember a few years ago, people were licking the backs of cane toads?"
Do I!
Awful things.
"So, this substance, it could ostensibly be attracting the insects."
"It is possible, but to be sure"
I need to be able to run some tests with a pure sample.
"All right, I'll get on it."
"Oh, hey, did you have any luck with that thing you were working on the other day?"
What thing?
"The Jane Doe, you and Mike."
"Yes, we were able to get an ID off her dental records."
You going to tell me or what?
Why wouldn't I tell you?
"It's, uh..."
Gabriel Claremont.
"Oh, okay."
The thing I'm not supposed to tell you is that this may have something to do with Henry Fitzroy.
"Oh, trust me."
"According to her agent, Miss Claremont had a photo shoot three days ago."
Nobody's heard from her since.
So the last person to see her would be the photographer.
I'm still working on that.
I did however find the address to the studio.
Do you want to go check it out?
- I'll get my coat.
- Okay.
Check the circuit breaker.
Nobody move!
Everyone here's a suspect.
Put on another pot of coffee.
It's gonna be a long night.
"Four turds, five suspects, so many, many nameless victims."
The first poop was obviously Frank.
"Old and weak, he had an accident, that's why he was so intent on destroying it."
"There were many turds before this one, weren't there, Frank?"
"This was just the first time you got caught, wasn't it?"
And then you went and did it again the next night?
Or did you?
Two poops in two nights?
Tall order for such a short man.
No.
The second poop belonged to Charles.
"He wanted to get back at Frank, but due to his poor diet, couldn't produce a turd."
"So he called Mac, who jumped at the chance to see"
Frank humiliated one more time.
But Charlie overlooked the fact that Dennis listens to Mac's phone calls and he heard every word.
Dennis was jealous that Charlie had chosen Mac to help instead of him.
He swore to have his revenge.
That's why encouraged Mac to sleep while he stayed up.
He was going to put the frame on Mac by pooping next to him.
But he didn't realize that a futon slept on by the weight of three men would be off its axis and slope to the center.
And like a small brown snail... it crept to the middle between Charlie and Frank.
Deandra!
You wanted in on this poop war from the start.
"No, I didn't."
The outcast?
The slut?
The bitch.
Lfinally went there and told them I was a faggot.
You mean it's that easy?
You need to dress like a fag.
"If you go there looking like him, it won't work."
"Well then, it should not have been hard for you."
"Nothing is ever hard enough for me, honey."
"Plus, you show them photos to prove you are a fag."
In yourdrag clothes?
"No baby, they have to show you being fucked up the ass."
Disgusting.
I don't want to sacrifice my ass just to escape the army.
If you go there without those photos you'll see just how disgusting it gets.
"Ha ha, your medical discharge proves you're a nut!"
"So what, asshole?"
I'd ratherbe called a faggot than die in some stupid warzone like yourdad did.
"Whatever, they won't get me anyway!"
What the fuck now?
Come and hold this...
Should I have a little tuck around my eyes?
I think you should find a camel and ask her.
And why is that?
Because they are honest.
They're so ugly so they have no otherchoice.
Are you a freak orwhat?
"Yes, no objections though."
I am enjoying every minute of it.
"If it weren't for Kerem, I'd kick yourass out right now!"
Are you senseless?
What's that supposed to mean?
Why would they call it common sense when it is so rare?
"You should be thanking me, jerk!"
...stupid cow.
And this material is identical to that of the suit.
It's been established that Mr. Somers was located in bungalow number 3.
"Where were you, sir?"
"Here, two doors down."
What time did you check out?
"I'm a salesman, see?"
And I like to travel at night.
So it was about 20 past 9 when I put the bags in the car.
That's when I saw him.
Saw whom?
Him.
"Let the record show that the witness pointed to the defendant, Axel Norstaad."
What was he doing when you saw him?
He was running like a scared rabbit out of the cabin.
How can you be so sure of your identification of a figure you saw running away into the night?
"Well, I ought to be able to identify Axel Norstaad."
I've been selling him a line of paint specialties for years.
"This is how it was, Mr. Mason."
First I went to see the bartender.
"Then I went into the office of the motel, and I saw the register."
And Somers is room 3.
I knock on the door.
There is no answer.
"But the door is open, and the radio is playing, so I go in."
"""Somers"", I say,"
"""if you try to make trouble for Edie like you do for me--"""
And then I see him on the floor.
I bend down to look.
And it was while you were bending over him that you got the blood on your trouser leg.
Yes.
"And when I saw that... also how it would look if someone come in and find me there, then I-"
- How do you say it?
What did he say?
We will attend.
It'll be the finest concert ever to be held here.
Of course I'll pay for the ferry tickets on Sunday.
Rolf and Knut will pick you up by car tonight.
Just the three of you.
Four guards on the pier.
"Most likely there won't be any guards on the ferry,   but the ferry crew members sometimes sleep there."
The raft is positioned a quarter of a mile from the dock.
"It's no problem getting there unseen,   but from the raft to the ferry, that's risky."
My neighbor will be on the ferry.
- You asked me to change the departure because so many people traveled on Friday.
- I know...
- You can't warn him now.
- It's his entire family!
Makes no difference.
Do you understand the consequences?
- You know someone on the ferry as well?
- Could be.
- Don't you think about that?
- I've been ordered not to.
- They are innocent people!
- And?
"We have gotten an order, so someone must have considered it."
We save more people by sinking the ferry.
- Is it really that simple for you?
"- Yes, it's that simple."
What if I warn him?
I didn't hear that.
Get up in the highlands and make contact with England.
There you await new orders.
I'll see you there in two days.
- No.
- Near Cherry Point.
It's like a military base.
"I went there 'cause I wanted to save my money to get a Hobie Cat, a boat."
Do you ever go sailing or anything like that?
- No.
- Do you know anything about--
"Well, you're sensitive."
"I bet you want to stay out of the sun, right?"
"You probably frizzle, you burn, you know?"
"Ha, look at that, you're smiling!"
Look at that smile.
"See, you use every muscle in your face when you smile."
You're all sad sack.
You know?
Can I get you a drink?
Maybe that'll cheer you up.
Then I can prove to you how good Iâm gonna be at this job.
"- Listen, Mora, can I have your phone number?"
Maybe I'll call you when--
- Oh!
My phone number?
"- I mean, just so I can call you when we figure out what we're doing, 'cause Iâm not sure what we're doing."
"- Okay, Iâm gonna give you a phone number."
"I don't really have a phone, but I know this guy--"
It's a long story.
"It's this guy I dated for a long time, he was actually an alcoholic and gay and he came to my house and he drank all the sangria and then I had this watermelon and he picked it up and he threw it on the floor"
and then he wet my bed.
"I dated him for two years, it took me five to get over him, but I'm gonna give you his number."
He'll call you.
"Ugh, he was a Sagittarius."
"You know, they say if you look at something green for ten minutes every day, it's supposed to cheer you up."
I understand if you don't trust me anymore.
"Listen, I have quite a lot to prepare for tomorrow."
"I tried to keep things separate, but I'm not as strong as you."
I've had pressure from all sides and now there's the thing with my ex-husband.
But that doesn't change how I feel about you.
I'd like you to understand that.
She was at the bridge.
His boat was found in Copenhagen harbour.
We'll look there.
The police have put in extra manpower at the harbour and along the coast.
- They've checked all ships in port.
- Where have the police not been?
- They haven't checked the containers.
- Have them checked.
- Is that realistic?
They're sealed.
- Contact the freight station chiefs.
Say we'll cover all the losses that possible delays may cost.
"But they're not all Zeeland containers, and the contents are private property."
I'll get it started right away.
I'll ask our legal team to handle the case.
"Apart from that, the Board wants a meeting."
You'll have to take care of it.
"I left the living room brieﬂy, when I returned, Carl had turned on the TV."
He was watching the news.
Don't listen to the things they say about Emilie.
Mum and Dad are looking for her.
You can ask us anything you like.
- What if you can't find her?
"- We'll find her, dear."
- When'?
- Soon.
"So I wrote ""Southern Nights."""
"When I was a little boy going on about six, my father would take us out to the country to visit our relatives out there."
"All of them spoke Creole, very little English."
I'd sit on the porch and I'd look up into the trees and everything was above me.
"As writers, we would like to be inspired all the time."
We would like the clouds to open up and receive us.
"""Southern Nights"" was a song that did that."
"It was a kind of spiritual feeling to be in that environment and to know where we came from, so we'd know where we're going."
"All these cities had so much to offer, musically and culturally."
And then sometimes there's obstacles.
"Sometimes it's weather, or in the case of New Orleans..."
We recorded in the middle of the French Quarter.
Kill the tape.
Let's call Dave Grohl in here.
He hit the bar.
"You know, if you put a guy like Dave in New Orleans..."
- Is Dave across the street at that bar right over there?
"- Yes, he is."
...sometimes you gotta go look for him.
We didn't have to look far.
Do you want to come check out this drum...
- What's that?
"- Hold on, I gotta pay..."
Came to haul Dave out of the bar.
How much?
- See y'all.
I'll be back.
- I'll be here.
"You pull me out of a bar, better have a good reason."
"It's like the Faces, dude."
Sounds good.
I had a blast doing the drum track.
Then getting around the town as well is not good either.
"Well, the bridge is the problem, isn't it?"
"Yes, the bridge is hopeless, it goes off several times a day."
The long-term future has to be to sort the infrastructure out.
NEWSREEL:
Increased activities in the dock has highlighted a problem...
The bridge!
"For generations, it has divided the town."
NEWSREEL:
"This is the real source of the problem, the town's harbour bridge."
"When it is raised to allow a ship to pass, everything stops."
It divides this small town.
It can take an hour to get from one side of it to the other.
"To use a bridge as a metaphor for hope might seem a bit obvious, a bit trite."
But it works.
Bridges get you to where you want to go.
"At least that, is the theory."
"Well, that's it."
"Nothing can go across it and even as I speak, the traffic is starting to build-up."
There's a lot of frustration out there.
We need a new bridge!
And a new A12!
Otherwise what happens?
We've got no work!
You blame that on the bridge?
Yes!
It goes up.
Who wants to bring a factory here when you have got to wait - this is going up-and-down all the time?
You need a new crossing?
We do.
Desperately.
"The Labour politician, the"
Then we go about our day making a series of decisions that lead up until that moment.
"But if we deviate from those decisions, then this photo never happened."
"Which means ""us,"" the people who saw the original photo, can't go forward."
Because our futures don't exist anymore.
"Um, what do you mean ""can't go forward""?"
"I mean, are we 100% sure that's how he died?"
"No, but do you really want to test it and find out?"
So it's agreed then.
We got to do what's in the photo.
"(SIGHS) Okay, all right, fine."
We have to do this tonight.
But we're talking about not reporting a dead body.
"I'm pretty sure if anybody found out, Jasper, that's jail time."
"Okay, but nobody's going to find out."
I-I was over there this morning to make a list.
"All we have to do is bring in his newspapers, water the plants."
We should probably move his car so it doesn't get any more tickets.
"Um, I found a couple pieces of mail."
"Maybe a couple bills, so I should probably post them."
(SIGHS)
"Well, you seem to have everything figured out."
Dude.
"Just relax, man."
"- The risk is so minimal, it's almost nonexistent."
- (SCOFFS)
"All we have to do is make sure that storage unit door stays closed, and... we become rich."
And you get your paintings.
Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
"Come on, Bobcat!"
"Fuck, yes!"
All those men were fighting over who could buy me a drink.
"Oh, what happened to your eye?"
I got lemon juice and grease in it.
"Oh, poor Joy."
"Poor, poor Joy."
Wonderful evening.
Have you ever had five men buy you drinks?
"Please, I've had six, often seven."
Just let me do the talking.
I've flirted my way out of dozens of tickets.
"What seems to be the problem, officer?"
Your blinker's been on for the last 5 Miles.
"I'm sorry, officer."
We're trying to get to the hospital for my poor sister's eye.
"Wow, you have a beautiful accent."
- Oh.
- We have the exact same accent.
Would you like an escort to the hospital?
"No, we're fine."
We have an excellent navigation system.
"I'll let you go with a warning, but drive safe, okay?"
You're carrying precious cargo.
Did I just flirt my way out of your ticket?
Thrilling.
You don't seem very happy for me.
"Of course I am, although, thinking about it, being hot isn't for everyone, which makes me wonder if, on some level, you wouldn't be happier back in the convent."
But I don't want to go back to the convent.
I'm having fun.
"Maybe, but it doesn't suit you."
"Oh, my goodness, you're jealous 'cause I'm blossoming and you're wilting."
You just can't stand the idea of not being the prettiest woman in the room.
"Well, you know what?"
Not the best vantage point.
There's your escape exit.
"Yeah,except he didn't want that."
He needs to watch the show.
This is the moment he's been waiting for all year.
One where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.
So he watches as long as he can.
"Yeah,but fire's unpredictable."
Every second in here he's putting his own life at risk.
And this guy's obviously confident that he can get out of here before it's too late.
But there was a fire alarm.
My men were here in 5 minutes.
- And he knew it.
- How?
This unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.
He knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.
He probably knows response times or at least listens to them.
"all units,be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 east mills."
this is your man dj cutz with an instant blast.
The feds are in town cracking down on this year's devil's night.
So i'd advise everyone to stay off of the streets and keep them radios locked to fm 99 detroit.
"the first time i looked at these victims on the map, none of it made sense."
"7 different victims,various ages,sex,and ethnicity."
- What do you see now?
- The first victim...
- Often tells us the most.
- Tommy proctor.
"Well,his rap sheet is longer than the nile."
It looks like he's always walked on the dark side.
The first kill inspired him.
What's different about it?
Two things.
Uncle Eddie has intel that we can use to penetrate Malvado's operation.
Do you have any idea how much time that can save us?
Of course not.
You have absolutely no clue because you're such a freak about murdering this guy that you don't think.
You just runnin' around lighting' things on fire like a little pyro kid who just found her first box of matches.
"And don't you ever tell me that I'm on a ""borracho"" or whatever."
"Thanks to you, instead of being this close to hitting our mark, we now have double the work."
We need those plans!
- So take them.
- What?
You're a thief.
Steal them.
- I'm not gonna do that.
- Why?
Because Eddie's like family.
Eddie is family.
The family you said you didn't need anymore?
You don't take another man's gig.
There's a code.
"Oh, there's a code."
"Right, there's a code. [Laughs]"
There's a code.
"The one your brother follows to the letter, correct?"
The one he's used his entire life to keep you under his thumb.
"I think it's time for you to make your own code, Richard."
[tires screeching]
"I swear to God, if you hadn't of stepped in,"
I was going to smack her in the face.
"Seth, she's talking shit."
"And yet, she was pretty specific, wasn't she?"
Said you made a deal with someone?
She's off her goddamn nut.
"Do you think when your marriage is over that you're gonna find somebody that just caters to you, no matter what?"
That you're not gonna have to work at it?
"That's gonna be, like, psyched to go to Applebee's with you every Friday night and hear the same football stories about how you rocked in high school?"
I did rock in high school football.
You want to check tape?
"But whoever that person is, you have to listen to their stories, too, or they're not gonna go to Applebee's with you."
You're not gonna have someone to go to Applebee's with.
"You'll be sitting by yourself, eventually, at Applebee's, all alone."
And who wants to go to Applebee's by themselves?
You know what?
"If anyone should be mad here, guys, it should be me."
"I am having a real fight with my wife, okay?"
And it's not a fun feeling.
Look it.
I'm talking in circles.
I'm on an island.
I'm getting island fever now.
I'm starting to lose my mind.
This is an early sign of things to come.
And what we need to do now is get focused and stop pointing fingers.
You're a problem.
"You're a real, real problem."
Is that Salvadore?
Does this guy think he's a mermaid?
What is his deal?
Oh.
"Please, excuse my nudity."
I was expecting no company.
Allow me to put something on.
"I would have asked you to join me, but the water is a little chilly."
But perhaps this will warm up the evening.
And what is that?
"Here I am, this little kid, I can't even see over the steering wheel and I'm parking Cadillacs."
"But, it wasn't too long before my parents changed their minds about my job at the cabstand."
"For them, the cabstand was supposed to be a part-time job."
But for me it was definitely full time.
That's all I wanted to do.
"People like my father could never understand, but I was part of something."
I belonged.
I was treated like a grown-up.
Tell him 519.
Every day I was learning to score.
"A dollar here, a dollar there."
I was living in a fantasy.
Did you have a good day at school today?
My father was always pissed off.
"He was pissed that he made such lousy money, he was pissed that my kid brother Michael was in a wheelchair."
He was pissed that there were seven of us living in such a tiny house.
Tell me about this.
It's a letter from school.
It says you haven't been there in months.
In months!
You're a bum!
Want to grow up to be a bum?
"But after a while, he was mostly pissed because I hung around the cabstand."
He knew what went on at that cabstand.
And every once in a while I'd have to take a beating.
"But by then, I didn't care."
The way I saw it everybody takes a beating sometime.
I can't make any more deliveries.
What do you mean you can't make any more deliveries?
You're gonna fuck everything up.
My dad said he's gonna kill me.
Look.
He offered.
"You know how in school, there are rules you have to follow?"
"Well, the same goes for here."
"We have to follow the rules, or else we get in big trouble."
And what that man offered you...
was definitely against the rules.
She's fighting with the insurance people again.
You're not supposed to worry about stuff like that.
"Tell her something good today, even if nothing good happens."
She needs good news.
I've got a body full of-- of high-quality parts here.
3-day liquidation sale.
Everything must go.
"Even if we could do it, you have to be a match for him."
Which means we'd have to crossmatch your blood with his.
Good thing we're both in a hospital then.
Let--let me save a life before I go.
It's the--it's the least I can do.
So you really expect me to believe that you want to do this for a kid?
"Whatever helps you sleep at night, dr."
Grey.
"The infection's made its way deep into the bone, so we're gonna have to take the rods out of your legs..."
And clean out the dead infected skin and bone.
You mean I won't get my 2 inches?
All that pain for nothing?
"Mr. Ruben, at this point, you're lucky to keep your legs at all."
"Yeah, that's easy for you to say."
"What are you, 5'10"", 5'11""?"
"Leave the doctors, alone, Chuck."
They're just trying to help.
"Oh, shut up, Gary."
You are over 6 feet tall.
"In another time, another place, could it have been me?"
"Perhaps, but you're talking about a world without Johnnie."
And that's not a world I'd care to live in.
"Have you ever looked at something and known you want it, want it more than anything you've ever wanted in your life before, and known that it can never be yours?"
"I have, and I tell you, it'll either finish you or put a fire in your belly that'll keep burning to the end of your days."
"I wasn't there at the beginning of the story, but you can bet your bottom dollar I'm not leaving before the end."
Because I know now that it has to be the right sort of ending.
The sort of ending that's worth fighting for.
Miss.
Oh.
Wanna stay and watch it again?
You'll find more in to make you laugh second time round.
I've seen it five times.
"It's our picture, isn't it?"
They're our girls.
"Thanks, but I'd better get back to work."
What's work?
Air-raid wardens.
- They want an outline.
- We haven't got a story yet.
"And they're asking about characters, apart from Hilliard as a cat burglar."
"Three girls, three different walks of life."
I need specifics.
"A nun, a showgirl, a lady wrestler."
"Seriously, you push us now, and that's what you'll get."
Men?
"Well, who else are the girls gonna fall in love with?"
- Each other?
- We've got titles.
Raiders Overhead.
Fires Overhead.
Fire in the Sky.
"""'Cause it hurts, bitch!"""
"And they got this stupid app now, and it's called Snapchat."
I don't know if y'all have heard of this.
That is the dumbest app I have ever heard of.
"It's an app that allows you to take a picture and send it to somebody, and it disappears within a matter of seconds."
"It's kinda like this, ladies."
I sent you a picture of my dick.
"No, I didn't."
"I had a chick, right, and she was looking sexy, man."
She had on the thigh-high stockings.
"She had her breasts all out, and she was looking amazing."
"And she sent me this damn picture, but it disappeared."
I was like...
"I texted her back mad as hell like,"
"""What the hell did you send me this for?"
"""I can't jerk off in five seconds!"
"What the hell?"""
"You find somebody that can jerk off in five seconds, they need to be put in the Guinness Book of World Records, and they need to fun for the presidency next term, 'cause they can get shit done fast."
That's all I'm saying.
But not me.
I'm not a punk.
"I'm a survivor, man."
Give y'all some background.
"You know me, I used to work at Golden Corral."
"""Whoo,"" my ass."
That place is terrible.
"As soon as you walk in, it smell like diabetes, don't it?"
"You know it's bad when the only good thing you can say about your establishment is,"
"""Uh, we got a chocolate fountain."""
That's the best thing about it.
I seen a nigga put a steak in there.
"And he was just turning it like a rotisserie chicken, just..."
"- I know, the cancer's back."
- While he's here waiting the mother has asked that you keep your distance.
- What?
- She doesn't want you interacting with her son.
What does Sean say?
She's a grieving mother.
I think we need to respect her wishes.
"Look, we should get their names or something."
How else are we gonna file a complaint against them?
Why don't you just be quiet?
Story checked out at the Y.
County confirmed you' re employed there.
It's not like we didn't tell you guys that.
You can pick up your stuff at the front desk.
Have a nice day.
Is her crit stable?
Holding at 29 with two units in.
"Luka, if you wanna take it easy for a while we can keep you out of the trauma rooms assign you to non-critical-care cases."
"If you need me anywhere, Kerry, you need me in here."
We all have times where we could use a little less stress.
I'm fine.
There's nothing wrong with admitting that you need some help.
I don't.
"Even so, I've scheduled a meeting with Dr. Meyers up on seven."
It's a formality.
Unless you wanna make it something more.
But it's mandatory.
You shouldn't have let them search the car.
That's what you do when you' re innocent.
I don't usually ride around with a bloody shirt.
- You guys hear what happened?
- I thought none of our people got hurt.
"I know... what you mean, but..."
Guess it's about the right time to eat some kidney beans.
Real stubborn.
That's for sure.
"""Who needs them!"" There's no television."
"And that refrigerator, guess how much I had to beg her to buy it?"
She still won't go for a washing machine.
"""Washing can be done without a thing like that,"" she says."
"A stone head, with a reed screen over it."
"It's delicious, really delicious!"
Eating with all of you makes the food extra tasty.
Grandma.
Let my sister cook the meals starting tomorrow.
I'm sure it will be good for everybody.
"And it will be much easier on you, too, Grandma."
Don't worry about me.
To put it simply...
Grandma's cooking is driving us to despair.
"In other words, your cooking just doesn't agree with our tastes."
"I mean, as a matter of fact, it's just plain lousy."
"I'm sorry, Grandma, but... this pumpkin and kidney beans, and pumpkin and chicken... it's so boiled down with soy sauce that we can't even tell which piece is which."
"- It is so black, and pulpy, and salty..."
- Tateo!
I think Grandma's cooking is lousy because of her false teeth.
"As long as everything is soft, it's all right with her."
- But we don't have false teeth.
- Shinjiro!
"Shinjiro, you sure are great!"
You did real well.
That's true.
Because of you...
I can sit at the table starting tomorrow with a sense of relief.
"All I know is, that's not it."
"Lieutenant, I need your help."
I need you to find out what's funny.
"Oh I can't, I've got to build this.."
I ran out of room for my shoes.
"Well this is more important, it's about me!"
Well how am I supposed to know what's funny?
What's so important about a sense of humour anyway?
Oh come on Tommy.
"Having a sense of humor is having the power, to transform someone's mood, to lift his spirit."
You give it to someone you love when she really needs it.
"And I just found out today, that Marys been getting it from another man."
"Dick, I think this whole being funny thing is just innate."
"What do you think, lieutenant?"
- What do I think?
I think either you got it or you don't.
Look what you just did!
What's wrong with you guys?
Come on!
"Wake up you two, come on!"
How am I ever gonna find out what's funny?
No I don't get it.
Give me an example of what's funny.
Okay let's see.
I thought the movie Emma was really funny.
What was funny about it?
Didn't you get it?
It was full of irony.
"Okay, so irony's funny."
"Sure, because someone says something, and the opposite is actually true."
"Oh okay, like when you told me Emma was gonna be a really great movie, when actually it sucked out loud?"
"Well, apparently, irony is a little too sophisticated for you."
"I'm not related, by blood, to your side of the family at all."
I didn't know that.
"What I'm trying to say... sometimes, you know, late in the day...."
Can I tell you about some of the specials we have today?
Right.
"Yes, thank you."
Maybe this will keep till we get home.
"First we have the prawn jalfrezi, very nice, with a niramish curry and Punjabi...."
"And the bedroom, which is...."
"Yes, I see what you mean about the post."
Wouldn't want to forget that's there in the middle of the night.
No.
And this must be the south-facing window you were talking about.
Looks out on the river.
I bet that's....
"Yeah, great when the sun comes up in the morning."
You warm enough?
I can turn the radiator up a bit.
"You know, I think I still got a bit of that tuna lodged in here."
In that gap next to the upper premolar.
"But, no, that was a great restaurant, wasn't it?"
Very nice ambience.
"So, what are you going to do, do you think, about that old woman's money?"
"Well, I don't know, 'cause, you know, she quite obviously didn't want it to go to them, so...."
Maybe I should give it to charity or something.
"I mean, in deference to her wishes because...."
I don't know.
What do you think I should do?
I think... that you should come and sit down.
"So, what will she do?"
Go straight to school tomorrow from her friend's house?
Yeah.
My husband had to borrow and beg to make this trip.
He went through all sorts of horrible difficulties and-
I know.
"Well, now he - he's gone."
That's why I was going to suggest that-
"And you were gonna take it away from him, steal it."
"Oh, now, please be reasonable."
Why don't you come in with me and Shorty on this thing?
"Where our map is incorrect, give us the right route."
We'll be partners.
"And, well, while you're about it..."
I suppose you may as well consider all angles.
We need your information about this.
We could probably find the mine ourselves without your help.
It would take longer.
"Of course, you don't know us very well... except that we're a little rough on women."
We might play you dirty.
"We might take your information and then tell you to, well, go jump in the river."
We might do that.
"On the other hand, we might be on the up-and-up with you."
Let me see your map.
"This river here - it isn't a river, it's a dry creek."
"- And that mountain peak, that's down here."
- Criminy!
That's it!
Ha!
All the other mistakes are minor ones.
"All right, Mr. Thornton, now you can tell me-"
How did you express it?
To go jump in the river?
We've gotta do a lot of jumping ourselves to get the 700 bucks for the outfit.
- Seven hundred dollars is hard to get.
Do you think I'm not worried?
Aren't they beautiful?
is that how you're getting ready to go to Austria?
"It's half past ten, when do you want to be ready?"
In a minute.
"- Marcel, you, too!"
- What for?
"We're going to see her off, aren't we?"
I don't know how to explain it.
"I trust her, but here it's not a question of trust."
I don't want her to experience some disappointment there.
"She's an idealist, she always imagines..."
Do you think I don't care?
"I didn't want to agree at first, after all, she's going to a strange world..."
"When it comes to such things, I'm totally..."
What should I do now?
Give her some guidance?
"In Salzburg the water in the lakes is cold, take care not to catch cold there."
Be careful about bathing!
- There's salt water there.
"- lt's not salty, but cold."
"I don't want you to bathe dressed up warm, but..."
You catch cold quickly and that's no simple matter.
I know I can bathe only in the afternoon.
And no playing the hero!
I know how such girls like showing off!
I never show off.
That's what we're worried about.
"After all, there must be some trust."
"You know, it's hard to explain what I feel... my wish for her is that everything will go smoothly."
"I wish she may have a great love, and that everything will be beautifully harmonious for the rest of her life."
A great love... are you thinking of the kind in novels?
They are a protected species.
"Well, we should let him go."
"What are you going to do, just put him on the ground?"
Just put him on the ground here and then we will...
"I think he's going to make a dash for it, wouldn't blame him."
Can't believe his luck.
"OK, he's just smelling..."
"Oh, he's going the wrong way now."
There he goes.
There he goes!
They find it hard to walk because of those big claws - of course they have to walk with the claws curled...
"Oh, look at that."
That's where the claws come in handy as well.
Oops.
Reasonably in handy!
That's better.
Got the hang of it now.
That's fantastic.
Splendid.
Well done.
"Well, that was a great success."
Yeah.
The pangolin faces an even greater threat than poaching.
"Like so many other animals here, it's fast losing its habitat."
The main cause - the dramatic increase in palm oil plantations.
Rows and rows and rows of these palm trees.
I know.
"It's scary, isn't it?"
It's literally as far as the eye can see.
"Look, over that hill and beyond."
"And these are all over South East Asia, aren't they?"
"Yes, it's one of the big conservation issues in the world, let alone just in South East Asia, because what's happening is vast areas of tropical rainforests are being cleared and replaced with palm oil plantations like this."
You ever feel that way?
What makes you think I feel that way?
Spring cleaning.
"Dragging the past out of the closets, seeing who we've become."
You still look great in a bikini.
I wouldn't know.
I haven't worn one since Josh was born.
Remember how I was supposed to be the cool mom who published thought-provoking articles and had a career?
All I've accomplished this weekend is five loads of laundry.
Not to mention an insanely aromatic marinara sauce.
"Yes, there was a time when I wanted to teach, but I don't feel like I'm really missing anything, 'cause I never went down that path."
But you had to go the corporate route to support our family.
Which I wouldn't trade for anything in the world.
Why don't you go gather the troops.
All right.
I'm on it.
Hey.
Is she coming?
I hope so.
She got my message.
"I know now is not the best time to ask, but can we add that electrical trick to the list?"
"I really want to learn that, too."
"After Amanda goes back to New York, when you have more time."
I promise I'll make time.
"But I have to make time for Amanda, too."
She might be staying.
"Oh, she's staying?"
She doesn't want to go back.
You're surprised.
"No, it's- it's good news for you."
Do you know why?
"Not yet, but now I have a chance to find out."
And we know he's gonna be watching.
"Well, we're gonna bust him this year."
We've got two agents on the way to last night's crime scene.
Great.
I'll meet them there.
I hope we find something soon.
It gets dark early this time of year.
- And we'll head to the morgue.
- Hope you have a strong stomach.
Gasoline was the accelerant?
"Gas vapors collect in a low, enclosed space."
"When he ignited, those vapors burned down to his bone."
We call this a fourth-degree burn.
There's a fracture on the back of his skull?
- That's right.
- Was that postmortem?
"No, it was antemortem bruising."
He was struck from behind.
Blitz attack.
What's this on the face?
Charred fabric.
All of the victims have the same material on them.
"The fire fused the original garment to his flesh, then burned away, leaving behind these remains."
- He's covering their faces?
"- That's my best guess, yes."
He doesn't want his victims looking at him even though we wants to watch them die.
It could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy.
"[Rossi] Now, wouldn't a guy like this want to see the terror in their eyes?"
"Instead, he keeps them in the dark."
He's covering their faces and setting them on fire.
It's an execution.
[Prentiss] It's easy to see why he sets fires down here.
You got him at the station?
"Ray, there's gotta be a way out of this for everyone."
"So, I say why don't we all go in tomorrow together?"
"Listen to me, Freddy."
You know the difference between men and boys?
Boys bet everything on everything.
Boys think every hand is a royal flush.
"You play cards with a man, he knows his limits."
"Freddy, I invited men... cops... good men... to live in this town."
"And these men, to make a living, they cross that bridge every day... to a place where everything is upside down."
"Where the cop is the perp, and the perp is the victim."
But they play by the rules.
They keep their guns in their holsters... and they play by the rules.
The only thing they did was to get their families out... before it got to them.
We made a place where things make sense... and you can walk across the street without fear.
And you come to me with a plan to set things right.
"Everyone in this city holding hands, singing ""We Are the World. """
That's very nice.
"But, Freddy, your plan is the plan of a boy."
You made it on the back of a matchbook without thinking!
Without looking at the cards.
I look at the cards.
I see this town... destroyed.
"That's not what you want, is it?"
I look at this town... and I don't like what I see anymore.
Who the fuck do you think you are?
"The sheriff of Garrison, New Jersey."
Then be the sheriff!
Defend this town!
Protect these men!
"Freddy, you got him at the station?"
Just drop the keys.
It helps them sell copies and benefits all parties involved.
- Noted.
"- We're wanting you to cover this as a feature for one of several magazines, that we're currently negotiating with."
"I just like the new book, and this idea came up, and I kind of suggested you."
"- Thanks, Josh."
- Interest?
Terms?
You'll take whatever we can get you.
It'll be two to three weeks.
"I assume we can get you something like 5,000 to 8,000 depending on where we ultimately sell it to."
Right in my pocket.
Sounds great.
"See, when I slam a door, life opens a window."
When do we leave?
You gonna be speaking in little turns of phrase like that the whole time?
I might.
I don't know.
I think this is gonna be fun.
You wanna go sit somewhere and talk more about it?
I think we're pretty much on the same page.
"Hey, thanks for doing this, by the way."
You don't seem to give a shit about this at all.
"Sure, I do."
I'm a nice guy.
Read an article about me.
I'm self-deprecating.
"No, I'm not thrilled you're going away for over a month."
That is why I'm acting like this.
Can we please not talk about this in public?
"It strikes me as unlikely, as you supported ideas like this when I still could have turned them down."
I need the money.
"What I said was, it would be good for your career."
"Philip Reinhardt, you're under arrest for murder."
"I didn't kill her, I didn't kill her, I didn't kill her, I didn't kill her."
"Philip, settle down."
What do I have to do to convince you?
"I mean, tell me."
I'll tear out my teeth.
Why don't you come clean about that relationship with Laura?
There was no relationship.
That's not the way to go.
"I mean, considering what we got on you."
You have cards?
Let's see them.
He tried to influence Gillian Booth to help him fabricate an alibi.
That's not true.
And the bite mark on his neck is an exact match for Laura.
Am I the only one who sees how absurd this is?
"Well, it must be incredibly frustrating for you."
"To feel like everybody else is out of step, except for you."
"I mean, you do more in one day than most people do in a week."
"Yes, yes, that's the story of my life."
"Well, you're hyper-manic."
A personality like yours faced with the intransigence of a young woman who led you on to further her career.
"- Yes, that's what she did."
"- Philip, don't."
It's unreasonable to expect that you would have reacted differently.
It was beyond your control.
Enough with the Vulcan mind meld.
Now I want to talk to my client.
Matthew.
"I can't ignore a bite mark, and neither will a jury."
"- Stooped shoulders, low affect."
"- Yeah, he's gonna fold."
Stay calm.
Don't mention that we have a relationship with you.
We have to do some quick work to get you out of there.
"I am supposed to be on the plane for Mexico, tomorrow morning."
I'm aware.
I'm gonna do what I can.
Refuse to answer any questions.
I'll get a lawyer down there to see you.
Sit tight.
"She's in immigration lock-up, desperate for us to intervene."
Let her stay there a while.
I'll go see her later.
Jimmy Reardon is staying at the Chickadee Club.
"His partner's upstairs apartment, is my guess."
"That's here at the front, on Seymour Street."
And that's probably the way we'll have to go after the club shuts.
"I need to know exactly what the layout is, so I want you two guys going in tonight to scope the club."
No weapons.
They've got security at the door.
You're just a couple of guys looking for a lap dance.
"The lap dances happen upstairs, so that gets you up there."
We're looking for a way into the apartment.
Who are you?
Bob Clay.
I'm the supervising DEA agent up here.
- How can we help?
"- Well, Bob..."
"We've got an operation running on the Chickadee club, a local strip bar."
We've been running surveillance for a couple of months.
That's this Reardon character's club.
We spotted someone doing surveillance on it.
We're wondering if you know who that is.
I'm not going to do this unless you and the kids come with me.
"I can't do it without you, ok?"
"So you do whatever, but...that's it."
"-You need Henry, not me, right?"
-That's right.
I don't care whether you go or not.
"If it'll make him a better witness, I want you with him."
They don't want me.
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.
They can only get to him by getting to you or your kids.
If he goes into the program you're in danger.
-l don't know anything.
-Don't give me the babe-in-the-woods routine.
I've listened to those wiretaps and I've heard you talk about cocaine.
Conversation after conversation you talked to Henry on the phone.
It doesn't matter.
"Whether he goes to jail or stays on the streets, he's a dead man."
He knows it and you know it.
What about the kids and school?
"I mean, what goes on?"
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.
Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.
What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.
"We'll save your life, his life, and we'll keep you out of jail."
This morning you told the jury about your background.
It was easy for us to disappear.
My house was in my mother-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.
My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.
I never voted or paid taxes.
My birth certificate and arrest sheet were all that showed I was alive.
"Come on, let's get down to the office."
"Hold your horses, i'm waiting here for a printer."
What printer?
A printer with a show bill of josie.
"Now look here, jim, you know more about injunctions than i do."
"Go on down to the office, i'll wait here for your show bill, if it's so important."
Will you?
It's not a bad idea.
And don't be afraid of him.
His bark is worse than his bite.
"Come on, luke."
"Come on, uncle daniel."
"Ohh... oh, stop moaning, will you?"
"Look here - if you don't smile, i won't go with you."
Come on.
"Won't you sit down, mr."
Boyd?
We'll not bother with formalities.
I had a reason for wanting to stay here.
Yes?
You know jim is spending more time on you than he does on business.
"Well, i'm sorry, but i've tried- look here, miss mansfield, there's only one thing in the world that's stopping jim fisk from being the richest man in this town."
That's you.
"He's in a tight spot, and if you're as smart as i think you are, you'll let him alone."
Even the right horse can't win if he's carrying too heavy a load.
"Excuse me, ma'am, the printer just brought this."
Thank you.
The 12 temptations.
And every one of them called josie mansfield.
All i can find in this erie charter is 40 different ways to issue stock.
And every one of them's padlocked by that pesky injunction.
"In 24 hours cornele will be sitting in that chair, cracking his bullwhip at me."
Was it my aunt Crystal who complained?
"Um, Georgie, I can't answer that."
I bet it was...
because she's mad at Lou and Peter because they didn't let her stay and get to know me.
"You know, I haven't seen her since I was two, and I don't even remember her."
"But my brother does, and he says that she wasn't very nice, and my mom didn't like her and she was a bad influence on us."
I don't really need to know the whole history.
You do!
"You need to know my aunt just as much as you need to know me because she's the one who's accusing my mom and dad of being bad parents, and it's a lie!"
You're supposed to be helping us.
You're supposed to be helping me.
"- Okay, so..."
- So what's the next step here?
"Um, I'm afraid I have to review the case further."
I'll be in touch.
Please stay in town.
- That's my best offer.
- Fair enough.
Not as many takers as we'd hoped.
"Well, rumour has it that Matt's been telling people the sale was cancelled."
- Look at this one.
"- No, I'm not sure about him."
"This is a really nice, young colt, okay?"
He was easily gentled.
"It's gonna some time to gain his confidence, but he's a hundred percent sound."
Good boy.
"Now if I can do this in a day, imagine what you can do with more time."
"Now if anyone is interested, please go see Matt and place your bid."
Why hasn't she called?
"You know, and Clint... picked the worst possible time to be on vacation."
"Of course, I've left more messages, but they're probably all going to Abby."
"Don't go over Abby's head, okay?"
Do-- you're -- you're sauntering on purpose.
Thank you.
No!
"You're not -- you are repellent to me, Dixon, and are no longer welcome in my home."
Wait!
"Wait, wait!"
But they drove!
Good.
Oh!
"Well, what do you want?"
We need to get out of the country.
We're told you're one of the best.
One of the best?
"I-I could smuggle the Queen of England wearing the crown jewels as a bikini past border security, and nobody would bat an eye."
We need the whole package -- new identities in a foreign country and safe passage there.
Can you do that?
"Normally, yes."
"Yes, I-I smuggle people, I smuggle items,"
I smuggle goods.
"Anything smuggle-able, I smuggle, all right?"
"But seeing as you guys are these lights-out super-spies, maybe you've noticed the triple-locked door, the arsenal, the many empty food containers."
Hmm?
"Did you maybe ask yourselves, do I look like I'm in a position to help anybody?"
!
Okay.
Why don't you just tell us why you're in hiding?
Let's start there.
How about I don't?
How about you leave?
"All you need to know is there's a big, scary guy who wants to grind me into dust."
"Mr Schmidt, there are at least a half a dozen things in here that I could use to blow you into little-bitty pieces, and I would use the dust to powder my nose."
"Look, we -- wow, we got off on a bad foot here, didn't we?"
Apple pie...
She put them in the porch to cool.
We had an apple tree in the backyard.
When coming from play and the porch would be filled with steam.
We couldn't have any pie until after dinner.
You were lucky baby she sounds like a real angel.
Listen I happen to have a free evening tonight.
I'd love you to come at my place I've done some changes.
I'd love to know what you're doing.
I'd love you for dinner.
"Well I have an appointment with a fashion photographer, I can't get out of it."
Well I'm glad your carrer is going so well.
The most interesting fact we found these killings occur during sexual intercourse.
"You don't know my mom was great, listen to this:"
One time she came out of the house for a ride.
And she was OK she was cool she was great.
"So she went out with this guy, this really straight guy, they went to this really fancy restaurant."
"You know, best in town!"
Right?
She was doing fine.
"And all of a sudden, man, she stood up on the balcony."
"She could be right up on the balcony man, and she pulled up her skirt and she looked at all the people and she said:"
"I'm Jesus Christ, man."
And I baptize you in the name of the son the father and the holly ghost and she pissed on every body.
It must have gone in the fucking food and everything.
Can you beat that?
Shit...
Then what happened?
Then they threw her back in.
Thank you.
"Get check, please."
Remember the last time you were off at the studio?
But instead you went rogue and you came to L.A.
"To keep tabs on you,"
"I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm."
And I placed it...
In my watch.
That was you.
"Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant."
So I lost track of you.
"And by the time I found you, you'd been shot in the side."
Who shot me?
You wouldn't say.
"You did mention your CIA handler, a guy named Jenkins."
You said that you were going to go and ask him to erase everything that had happened to you here.
But that doesn't sound like me.
I'm curious by nature.
Why would I do that?
"I have no clue, but you were adamant."
"And you made me promise that if I ever met you again,"
I'd never say any of this.
"Well, that doesn't explain why you stuck around, why you agreed to come work with me."
"I'm fond of you, Rick, and I adore your daughter."
"And after a lifetime of caring about nobody but myself,"
I decided to stick around and keep an eye on you two.
It's like a Philip K. Dick novel.
Wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to erase my memory.
Or you could trust that you did it with good reason.
"Maybe just let your lost time go, because if you keep looking, if you keep searching for that answer, well... there's no telling what kind of hell you'll unleash."
Dad?
What did Hayley tell you?
The truth.
Why did Hayley lie to us?
Because I asked her to.
"Good evening, Mexico City!"
"Oh, my God."
One of the best things about all of this  the fact that have now made four new best friends.
Mexico!
e're all there for each other and I think that's why it works.
t's cool man.
You don't get that if you're a solo artist.
"Now we're just  five brothers, if you Iike because we spend more time with each other than we do our own families."
e just feel lucky that  there's not one guy  in the group who's an absolute ass.
You guys have been right there since day one.
And it means so much to us because none of this would happen without you.
The fans completely changed our lives.
e are so thankful.
And I think it's important  that we try and let fans know  that this is a teamwork between us and them.
We've got the best fans in the world.
don't think we'll ever get fully used to it because it's all just a bit too mad.
"We just go about it day to day, and we don't take it too seriously."
"And that's the main sort of thing that we all live by that keeps us you know, as us."
I couId just do this for the rest of my Iife.
just love it so much.
You know 'd do it till was lik e weathered and people were asking why I was still alive and stuff.
Like Keith Richards.
hat a gig though.
"I mean, we even got fireworks."
"Yeah, amazing."
"You know what, Liam?"
You are one of the worst-smeIIing people I've ever known.
-Yeah.
-could we have a nod or a shake from the camera if I'm smelly.
Am I smelly?
Sing it!
"Last time, O2."
I thought Sandy said it was safest for us to stay where we are.
"No, no, no, Sandy said that it's safer for all of us to be together."
"All right, folks, we got to remain calm and we got to remain here."
"Anyone in need of medical attention, please identify yourself to this gentleman, and everyone who is willing to help anyone who might need it, please come over and introduce yourself to me."
"The good news is, we got everything we need here."
"We got shelter, we got food, we got water."
"We got fine literature, chips and salsa, so if we all stay together, we can get through this no problem."
All right ?
This is like Berkeley 1989.
"Oh, you say that so warmly."
"Not that I'm fond of natural disasters, but there is nothing sexier than your husband calming an angry mob."
"Now, are you okay ?"
"Yeah, I know I've been complaining about Newport a lot lately, but it just breaks my heart to see it like this."
I'm going to pass these out.
All right.
Hello ?
"Oh, hey, Sandy, I'm glad I finally got a hold of you."
Are you with Ryan ?
"Oh, no, Frank, but he's at the Cooper house with Taylor."
"He's fine, we're all fine."
That's great news.
"And Julie and Caitlin, they're at the house too, right ?"
That I don't know.
Do you have any idea where they might be ?
"I'm sorry, I don't, but I'm sure they're going to try to get in touch with you, and if I hear anything at all, I'll call you."
"I... yeah, yeah, thanks, Sandy."
Great.
"Okay, Gary, how's it look up there ?"
Can you climb down and get some help ?
Um... not really.
Why not ?
What's going on ?
If you ask him then he can ask you in return.
Otherwise you don't need to ask him in the first place.
"Still, I don't have to tell you what my business is."
Then he doesn't have to tell you if someone was here.
That makes sense.
You're really smart.
If you are that smart you should remain that smart.
"Hey, wait."
Stop for a moment buddy.
Just a moment.
Stop running!
Why are you in such a hurry?
What do you want?
"Just asking a question, nothing else."
"So, where are you going?"
- Work.
"- Ha, that will take a while to find any."
"But I have something for you, with all your muscles."
"I don't use my muscles, I use my big mouth."
"Come closer, ladies and gentlemen!"
Why does the wealthy man in the west wear a bow and the yobbo doesn't?
"You too, young miss with your husband."
Why doesn't the yobbo wear a bow?
Because he can't tie one.
So he buys a clip-on tie... and after the purchase it goes bad and then he can't tie a tie.
That's betrayal of the costumer and fraud and it enrages the people!
It pushes Germany even further into misery.
"Come closer, ladies and gentlemen!"
The gents from the Sturmtruppe are welcome too to participate.
"Come closer, please ladies and gentlemen so I can go easy on my voice."
"You see, I didn't insure it because I haven't paid the first deposit yet."
"Buy my little machine, no assembly required!"
Well you're really a brave.
You're the first man to ever leave me just before we're about to have dinner.
Fuck the guests.
Fuck the party.
Just gonna sleep.
Be serious.
I'm ab-so-fucking-lutely serious.
Don't talk to me like that.
Why can't I?
Because...
"Because this is your place, because you pay for anything"
Let's not start that subject again.
"I didn't start that subject, you did, I don't care..."
I'm sorry but I'll be right back.
Oh don't expect me to wait for you.
I don't like cold chinese food.
I don't intend to start liking it now.
I'm sorry but duty is more important than shrimps.
Well the duty is yours the house is mine.
And in my house shrimps are more important than duty.
I'm going to sleep.
Right?
You ruined your carrer and now you want to ruin mine?
You know I've invited everybody to this.
"Do you know how hard I've worked to make everything perfect, and you've not lifted a finger to help me!"
Now you want to humiliate me and embarass me in front of my clients.
You wanna just prove to everybody that you're a failure.
"That you take dope, you take drugs, that you haven't made any money from any of your films, your books or anything you've ever done, mainly."
"You want to humiliate me, that's your point."
But I'm such a fool to love you.
"Well, if you don't like me, leave!"
This is my house...
He may have been in the snare for hours afterwards.
That or that he was attacked while in the snare.
By this feral child?
"No, she was inside a cage at the time of the murder."
"William, I'd be most interested in examining her if it would help."
Of course.
"Thank you, Julia."
"Oh, I spoke with the nanny at the hotel, and she assures me that Roland is fine."
I know you were concerned about leaving him with a stranger.
She'd let us know if he needs us?
Of course.
Of course.
"And the animal bones that I saw in her cage, George, some of them are too big to be from chickens."
She may be eating cats and dogs even.
Maybe even a goat?
"Could be a small goat, Henry."
"You know, you joke, but the keeper told us she fought off a wolf when she was 7 years old."
She has a nasty scar on her arm to prove it.
"These would be the wolves that raised her, I assume."
"Don't be so ridiculous, George, it wouldn't be the same wolves."
The attack likely came from a rival pack.
"Henry, let's get to work."
Right?
"What were you hoping to catch, Mr. Hewitt?"
"Well, it wasn't a man, I can tell you that."
"You see, something is killing livestock at my farm."
I reckoned whatever it is roams the ravine and I aimed to catch it.
"Your farm is near where you set the snare, correct?"
- Yes.
- Were you home that night?
Did you not hear a man cry out?
"Well, I heard noises, but I thought it was the animal"
"I was like, ""He's going to be traumatised,"
"""he's run to the front of this room and had this amazing song"
"""and he's running out of fucking words."""
"And my thing to help him here, was to make a joke, like,"
"""Whoa, someone hasn't got the..."" I couldn't shit on it, I couldn't make a joke, he was really in it, everyone in the room's rooting for him to nail this song, and I just thought, ""You know what?"
"""I've had a thousand bad gigs, I can do this"", so I just stood up, no jokes, this is not funny, I'm in the room, straight-faced and I'm like..."
# And you can tell everybody...
# This is your song... #
And then the room starts joining in.
# Hope you don't mind!
#
The couple...
"So, no-one's laughing, everyone's totally in this and I'm like, ""Do not laugh, just be here."""
The couple I met on the first day then burst into tears.
"""This is our wedding song."""
"It was like an emotional orgy, it was the whole room singing."
ALAN SINGS INAUDIBLY It was insane.
"But breakfast the next day, it's like..."
Awkward.
"It is like a one-night stand, yeah."
"Everyone's like, ""How you doing?"
You all right?
", can I get the eggs?"""
"""There was a lot of singing, you're right."
"""We should meet up and go on a walking holiday""."
"""I never want to see any of you again."""
"But, yeah, and whenever anyone says, ""What's the worst gig...?"", that flashes into my brain."
"Nothing is as bad as having to not smile and to not make a joke of it, and hold a note and sing along to this guy who didn't have, like, an awful evening."
You've saved him.
I did.
"It was traumatising, it was really traumatising."
"Well, I loved that story."
We were doing so well too.
"That rich girl was good, I liked that."
"Fake ransom note was a little elaborate, but it was creative."
The note was incredibly unlucky.
And then there was the pizza boy.
Loved that.
Straight to the point.
But you ruined it all from the very start with the Christian.
It wasn't so clever making Stubbs swallow the article.
It's a pity it proved as indigestible as you said it was.
I don't know why I did that.
I got carried away.
"Ah, that's the thing."
You get carried away.
I hadn't counted on you being so histrionic.
Look what happens when you try one on your own.
You're not really a man of action.
"You're better suited to the desk, to study, to the..."
How did Hegel put it?
The adoration of the question mark.
An_ay...my real bone of contention is you going and killing Henry all on your own.
What the hell did you do that for?
It was against everything we had agreed - random selection.
"When they came to me about the note, you doubted me."
I doubted your ability to execute a murder without broadcasting it to the world.
And so has it proved.
I wanted to show you that I have a heart for this.
Heart?
Heart is exactly what we don't need.
We started this because we could.
We didn't want reasons.
We didn't need anything a crass as a reason.
And if I find one thousand of such men.
I will put them all one thousand of them in blue uniforms!
I will ignore status and rank and place men in service based on their talent and ability.
"And from this moment forward, that will be the highest, most strictly enforced law in this naval station."
"Acts that undermine this law will be seen as acts that assist the enemy, and I assure you there will be severe consequences!"
You're so good!
You're so good!
Why are you hitting my bottom?
You're so good.
I'm just so proud of you!
You should be the head cook.
They're all identical in size like they've been pressed with a mold!
Let me see your hands.
Are you hiding a special tool?
Stop kidding around!
I'm not in the mood!
What's wrong with you?
Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed?
"Some men become commanders overnight, but look at me!"
I'm stuck in the kitchen making rice balls!
I can't take this anymore!
You're here early!
I'll go bring my tools and join you.
That's a fine color!
You look mighty dandy in that uniform.
I guess clothes really do make a man!
Uncle Chang...!
Did you make and fix those ships all by yourself?
"If they're going to put you in a commander's uniform, shouldn't we be in commander's uniforms too?"
"Good luck, Commander!"
You're on your own!
I'm in no mood to work!
"If you're a dude in here, and you think it's gross that I've used a Fleshlight, you need to look at the facts."
"You're in a city that you do not live in, in a hotel room by yourself."
Someone gives you a free Fleshlight.
You can go fuck yourself if you think you're not gonna go fuck yourself.
You're immediately going to go fuck yourself because you have to know.
What is it like?
"I know some people are in here, ""Oh, I don't need a sex toy."""
Grow up.
"If you were out on the sidewalk right now and someone pulled up in a Ferrari and was like, ""Get in,"" you're not gonna be like, ""But I already have a car."""
No.
You're gonna get in.
And you're gonna find out the hard way it's a Kia Rio in disguise.
Here's how they work.
"Whoo, this joke is a two-parter."
"You have to take a fake, rubbery vagina... out of a flashlight casing and put it in warm water for five minutes."
Never in your entire life will you feel more ridiculous.
"Standing in a hotel bathroom... naked, 'cause you're ready."
You're ready.
You don't know.
You don't know what's about to happen.
Be ready.
Be naked.
Be ready.
Standing over the sink like a kid who just dropped one of those dinosaur sponge pills into the water.
Can't wait for my vagina to be ready!
I love going on the road!
Brings out the best in me!
"When you're doing that in a hotel bathroom, there is one other person in there with you, and you lock eyes the moment you look in the mirror."
And he's got questions.
"Rory, how did we get here?"
How did we get to this point?
You're married.
But I don't wanna do it until I know why he wants us to do it.
"I mean, something's wrong here."
"What is this, Daze?"
"I mean a guy doesn't just up and hijacked a truck chuck full of cash and cologne, to get himself rub out."
There are other ways.
"I want this guy's story, but getting it would just make our job harder,"
I mean it changes everything.
That's why they don't name any other pigs on a sausage farm.
"And for that reason, I don't think we should talk to him anymore."
"That's gonna be tough, He's interesting."
He sure is.
How about those cookies?
Oh man!
Have you ever had anything like that in your whole life?
"If we were rich, and didn't have to kill him, we could pay him, just to make those cookies for us all the time."
"Hell, what if the cookies are just the tip of the iceberg?"
What if he makes brownies?
"We'd get so fat, but it'd be so worth it."
"Anyway, let's just do it as we said before,"
We just runnin' there blast him.
- You bring anymore ammo?
- No.
I thought you said you have some more.
"Nah, I just wanted to sound pro and say I did."
It's not like we're facing five or six jokers who's shotgunned one of Chet's night club.
"Besides, I was tryin' to save up for the dresses."
Never get to hang of this.
There must've a time in your bucket list that I wouldn't sweat it.
Where's that place again?
What place?
"The place, where you said we could get the bullet."
I thought you had some.
"""We'll remember this forever."" So my wife and I are having sex."
"What I didn't realise was that right over the ridge, when they took off to leave to go to town three hours away, there was a ranch, and on the ranch, luckily enough, this guy had a spare tyre, the same exact size."
"They were back about 20 minutes later, mid-sex."
They come over the hill.
I'm like this.
"My wife and I look, we make eye contact with them and they just drove by us as if nothing was happening."
Tactful.
That's tactful.
"We get dressed as quickly as possible, we get in the van, five-hour drive home."
Nobody brings it up.
Five hours of silence.
Five hours?
Really?
"And in the six years that I worked with that woman, her and her husband invited us to do one other thing, and that was to go to a concert."
"We go to the concert, and I'm with her husband and I see this woman who's just dressed slutty and I turn to him and go,"
"""Oh, my God!"
"Look at this slut!"""
"And he goes, ""Dude, that's my sister."""
"I go, ""Bullshit that's your sister!"""
And he calls her over and it was his sister.
You deserved that one.
"And you go off and you find a bucket of water and you go,"
"""Does she want a shower?"""
Good one.
Really?
"Five hours all the way home and no-one could say,"
"""Well, that was awkward."
We thought you were going to be gone longer
"""and, you know, we got caught up in nature and everything."""
I had to see her at work every day.
Every day I had to go back to work.
Do you think they might have been watching you for a while?
You cannot undermine me every time I try to discipline him!
I can't help it.
"He's so small, and helpless..."
I can't take any more of this!
It is tearing our marriage apart!
"For his own good, you have got to buckle down!"
"Do you understand me, Lois?"
You have to find some way to be this boy's mother!
"Hello, Dr. Sachs?"
It's Lois again.
"I know I just called, but... my husband yelled at me again about being stricter with Francis, and I wanted to know if you could write me a note that says yelling at him could damage his psyche?"
It's such a tender time for Francis.
"He's so fragile and unformed and I just want to make sure I get it right, but everything I do feels wrong."
"If this is all supposed to be so natural, why can't I get this?"
"I love him so much and I want to be a good mother and I know I have to be stronger, but I just don't think I can look in his eyes and not give him what he wants."
He has such a sweet little face and he's so innocent.
I'm going to have to call you back.
Fire... is... dangerous.
Fire can hurt you.
Fire can kill you.
I will not let that happen.
Let me make one thing clear.
"I love you, and I will do whatever I have to to take care of you, and keep you safe and happy and alive."
"I don't care if you grow up to hate me, but you will understand this:"
I will... do... anything.
That is how much I love you.
Yes.
That's right.
It's coming back to me;
"that sense of strength and power, and purpose..."
"I finally knew who I was, and what I was born to be."
"Honey, you're back!"
Listen.
"I made her a passport, and then I lost the paperwork, 'cause that was part of the deal."
I don't -
- I don't even remember the name that I gave her!
"Oh, I think you'll remember."
"Today, you're gonna die, Mr. Schmidt."
Only question is how much you're gonna suffer.
This knife ain't hot enough.
"When an operation goes seriously wrong, you have to decide quickly whether to bail out or keep pushing and try to salvage what you can."
"Bailing out is less risky, but when it means leaving someone behind to die, sometimes you just have to grit your teeth and roll the dice."
"Mr. Hamady, can I talk to you for a second?"
"A few hours ago, that bastard was gonna kill me, but your men saved my life."
I owe you for that.
I think I can help you.
I don't need your help.
"With all due respect, I think you do."
I was an interrogator for the Special Forces.
You're trying to find your wife?
I can help you do that.
Yeah?
What can you do that this cannot?
Trust me -
- I know what I'm talking about.
You told him that he would die no matter what.
"You start cutting him up, he'll tell you every lie until he bleeds to death."
So what do you propose?
You ever heard of suxamethonium chloride?
It's a hypnotic sedative.
"You pump Schmidt full of that, he'll give you everything that you want."
I used to work with a medic.
He can get it for me.
I just need to call him.
You need me.
You don't even have your own hairpin.
I do now.
You happy?
"Well, yeah, I know a few guys who do I.D. work, Mike... but, you know, the feds are gonna be all over them too, especially now."
"Feel 'em out for me, will ya?"
"Mike, they said if you leave Miami, they're gonna pick you up."
And D.C.
- There's gonna be someone there who is gonna recognize you.
The best fake I.D. in the world isn't gonna change that.
The guy that burned me tried to have me killed.
"As long as I'm in Miami, he can find me."
I'll take my chances in D.C.
You know who might be able to help... is Lucy.
"She called a while back with a job... but you were pretty busy with this whole burn notice business, but now-"
- What's the job?
"- Well, I don't know the details... but I do know that she works with some real artistes."
These are the kind of guys who can give you a whole new life to go with your I.D.
- You interested?
- Let's give her a call.
Corporations need spies just like governments do.
"Of course, they're not called spies."
They're called security consultants.
They're basically mercenaries with nice suits.
Your offices just keep getting better and better.
"It's good to see you, Michael."
What have you been up to?
"Little of this, little of that."
Haven't you been getting your reports from your F.B.I. buddies?
I didn't tell them anything they couldn't find out for themselves.
"If you tell them, they don't have to find out for themselves, do they?"
What?
You order your men to get in behind them rocks... and you see us down as far as the bridge.
"We'll let you loose, and there's no harm done."
How's that?
"Speak, you ape, or I'll kill you."
"You would throw away your shield, brave soldier?"
"- Do you hear something, Bal?"
"- The bagpipes, Mac?"
"I've been hearing them for hours, but it isn't them."
It's the blistering heat screaming in our ears... that makes it sound like it.
"They'll pull us out, old boy... if they can find the blasted place."
"Don't waste any of your guff on me, Mac."
"Here we are, and this is it."
"It might have been worse, though."
I might have left a widow.
"Eight feet away from where I'm sitting, right here... there's enough gold to make me sole owner and proprietor... of a pub as big as the Crystal Palace."
Best pub in Hampshire.
And here I am.
You torturer!
Setting that in front of my eyes.
Is there no limit to the torture an Oriental mind can think up?
"So help me, if you mention gold again, I'll tear the tongue out of your head."
Here it is.
Get it.
"Brave soldiers, can it be that your nerves are tightening?"
"We can stand it up here as long as you can, Mr. Wise Man."
"Preserve your courage, gentlemen."
You are not forgotten.
They will come to save you.
"That's right, mate."
You're going to see more soldiers than you ever saw before.
"Gentlemen, good news."
Here's a sight that should make your hearts pound faster.
"You can guess it from my modus operandi, say something new."
Your body can bear anything.
"You can say it looking at my body, say something new."
"You trust your sense of timing, you're cocksure nobody can catch you, above all you're good in making caustic remarks."
"You can judge it from my words, say something new, partner."
"If my guess is right, you're near by, looking at me while speaking to me."
Your guess is perfectly right.
"One more thing, you're the best one to catch me, but do remember one thing, I'm always top and you're always down."
You can never catch me.
"You've hurt my ego unnecessarily, and challenged me, wherever you may hide, I'll hunt you down."
"How can you catch me, partner?"
Do you know how do I look like?
You don't know.
Do you know where would I be?
You don't know.
Do you know who's next victim?
You don't know.
Do you know where would I be tomorrow?
"You don't want to meet the character in your story, but I want to meet the character in my story, actually I'm here to catch him."
What?
"In the arrogance that I can't catch him, he left a clue for me."
Do you know where would I be tomorrow?
He didn't call me a loser.
It's a clever clue he gave me.
I took two days to crack it.
This is not just a word but the flight number he took to Malaysia.
Right now he's in this city only.
He can't escape from me this time.
I'll catch him even if his shadow falls on me.
Can you guide me to this address?
And you...?
I too don't know.
They were meant to hit other men.
Want to deny yourself the opportunity of venting all that rage and frustration you have over bush and 9/11 out on another living human being?
And you could imagine bush's face on the head of your opponent just before you cave it in.
"Yeah, if it's such a good idea, how come you don't step into the ring, huh?"
'Cause I'm a pussy.
"But you, my giant latin friend, you are one thick spic."
"I mean, the very sight of you strikes fear in the hearts of men."
Me included.
"If I wasn't your superior officer, would I be saying any of this to you right now?"
"If you weren't my superior officer, I'd be pounding the shit out of your right now."
That's the killer instinct a good fighter needs.
"So what do you think, franc?"
Can I wear head gear?
You can wear a dress and a jogging bra for all I care.Just say yes.
Yes.
"Yeah, I swear to god, guys, if good old nielsy didn't cut the wheel and nail the brakes just at the right time, there'd be like 4 people dead."
Nielsy's one of the finest wheel men on the job.
"Yeah, he's like B.J. And the bear minus the monkey."
I'd like to get a monkey.
"Man, I'd love to be a driver."
"Well, usually just senior guys drive, kid."
"Now that there's so few of us left, newbies can take the course in maybe 2 or 3 years."
"Oh, would that mean he wouldn't have to go into the fire?"
That part of his job is a little hard to get around.
"Well, it doesn't hurt to ask."
"Maybe once he graduates probie school, I can put in a good word."
Have him assigned to this house.
Keep him in good hands.
"You, sidney, are too sweet."
He's a good kid.
Certainly comes from fine stock.
And you can call me sidney.

Neždet. her sisteranswered the phone?
I spoke with her
"Kader Altun,of all those letters that you sentto your son, are missing, right?"
"Maybe theylost in the mail,"
It probably happenedBefore I sent them to my niece in Trabzon. did you ever mention in any of these lettersyour relationship withmr.
Sulejman?
Never!I never mentioned it
"Nazif from Trabzonwas very honored one . to tell him about my relationshiplt would hurt him,and also make him so angry."
"How can we comprehend,you have not to mention it To protect Suleiman's life?"
"Not at all,"
I did not writebecause it was inappropriate...
In the town where I'm fromthey do not accept easilythis kind of relationship.
Maybe Nazif Kara learned about your relationship from someone else?Is that possible?
Maybe some offriend or relative?
No.Nobody knewabout our relationship.
"Many years passedsince I escapedfrom his family,"
"That's why I changed the name,I never used the name Kader,only Nihan"
So I couldnot be found.
mrs.
"Kader,you came to the court on the day of the murder.Why did you come?"
That was the day ofMahir engagement...
I wentand saw my son from a distance...
It is so difficultfor a mother not to benear her only sonon such a beautiful day.
I stood thereas a foreigner...
Then I wentby Suleiman cryand share my pain with him.
Suleiman was alwaysvery compassionate and promised to help meto meetwith my son...
He promised me he would call Mahirand called him to come totalk to him.
"Wait a minute,just a little bit..."
So that was the reasonwhy Suleiman sent the policeto bring in Mahir Kara that day?
I do not know...but I think so...
He promised to call him... mr.
"Judge,This explains everything!Nazif Kara went instead Mahir to prevent the mother to meet her son forever"
*and then sentenced to life in prison plus 33 years. *
*Is that justice?*
*it is justice for my people that is at stake. *
AG:
"That is an excerpt of a letter Assata Shakur read,"
"*When my people receive justice, I am sure that I will receive it, too."" *"
*Let me emphasize that justice for me is not the issue I am addressing here; *

"When we come back from break, we'll be joined by Assata Shakur's longtime attorney, Lennox Hinds, and the scholar and activist Angela Davis."

This is the daywas the day of my engagement...
The Godfather Ismetcame for me and we went as usual to the barbershop in the neighborhood...
"Back than ,I learned that the policetook my father..."
At first I was not surprisedbecause a few days ago the shoping Centerwas robbed against which we raised a complaint...I thought it was because of that the police were there... and took away my father actually allstarted after the robbery...
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world
That picture of everything I ever dreamed
Now the picture's crashing down around on me
Calls are coming in and we're looking at our friends
Wondering who's it gonna be
It was so good once upon a time
It was a simple time
It was a good time
Now we got the perks and all the crème
And it's tearing us apart at the seams
But I remember
When it was good
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No I never wanted nobody else
When it was right not like tonight
We were sitting on top of the world
When it was good
No we didn't have a cent to our name
When it was good
We were happy in the pouring rain
I wish it would would be that good
When we were sitting on top of the world
Once upon a time it was real
Once upon a time I was thrilled to get yo call
Then I could get yo all
Then I could get your heart
Now ain't the same
Seem like now it's a game
Once was reckless but now it's tame
You may see on the right side
"Casentino and Murlo, two small villages, once Etruscan settlements, closer to South West Asia than to Europe, while in Volterra this ancient signal is now too diluted to be detected."
"Human and bovine mitochondrial DNAs indicate that Etruscans and bovines docked to Tuscany, sailing from S-W Asia."
This also confirms how the Italian wisdom
"""take wife and cattle from your homeplace"" is now totally implemented."
"Since domestication, animals always accompanied humans during migrations, wars and conquers."
"They have been silent witness of human history, but until recently they have been impossible to query."
"Now, thanks to DNA analysis, they can tell us their story."
Thanks for your attention.

Elaborate a plan

Quick everyone out!
Quick!
Quick!
Pathetic....

SUSAN?!
Ok this could be a plan to end the meeting but you can find a better one:
Elaborate a media plan
Elaborate a plan
Right gang.
Are we in top gear or have we stalled in the pits?
What have you got for me?
Adding YouTube to the TV media plan!
Bravo!
World champions!
A big bottle of bubbly on me!

Stop!
"Do not come any closer, Young Miss."
I cannot reveal my identity due to reasons untold.
Then at least tell me your name.
"What is the use of revealing my name, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;when we are like two leaves flying by in the wind?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Let us just remember each other by our fragrances in the moonlight.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
But I don't smell anything.
Do not come any closer and ignite the explosives of love in my heart.
But I don't have any fire on me. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The light in your eyes is enough to light any fire in a man's heart.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Now that the fire has been put out, I will bid you farewell like the wafting smoke."
Are you telling me to be like fire and go out?
Alright then.
"I'll go. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell, Doe Eyes.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
What did you just say?
I...
I mean...
Do you know me?
No.
"But didn't you just say, ""Farewell, Doe Eyes""? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;No, I said ""Farewell, Goggle Eyes""&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; because you looked like you had bad eyesight."
So you may go.
"In any case, thank you."
I'll repay this favor in the future.
I am Heo Yi Nok.
I sell medicine in front of Merchant Wang's store.
"By the way, I have great eyesight!"
Don't worry about me!
"He hasn't seen her in a year, and yet he can't say what he wants to her."
Wait!
I have a request.
Forgive me for sending you away without showing you my face.
But I cannot reveal myself to you. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But I know I will think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
"Please take care of yourself. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I'm sorry for sending you away like this.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I will not be able to show myself to you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;But even so, I will always think about you.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;I hope that you'll be safe.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Farewell...&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Stupid girl.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"Farewell, Young Miss."
Maybe there's even more magic here than we know about.
"Now, I have continued to discover  that there's little things in, anandamide, for example,  the bliss chemical is present in chocolate."
"The love chemicals,  phenethylamines that are damaged by heat, but entirely present  in raw chocolate."
There's at least seven of them  in raw chocolate.
"And those are the feelings of love, happiness and fulfillment that chocolate gives us."
It's from a chemistry that's in the plant.
This is the book.
"And if you recall the book,"
"I do want to mention that when I got to chapter 16, there was a most amazing citing that occured for me  when I was in Amsterdam many years ago."
(Laughter)
[You] can guess what happens there.
"""Oompa-Loompas!""  everyone said it at once."
"""Oompa-Loompas!"
"Imported direct from Loompaland,"" said Mr Wonka proudly."
"""There's no such place,"" said Mrs Salt."
"""Excuse me, dear lady, but..""  ""Mr Wonka,"" cried Mrs Salt,"
"""I am a teacher of geography."""
"""Then you'll know all about it,"" said Mr Wonka."
"""And oh, what a terrible country it is!"
Nothing but thick jungles infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world -- hornswogglersand snozzwangers  and those terrible wicked whangdoodles.
A whangdoodle would eat  ten Oompa-Loompas for breakfast and come galloping back for a second helping.
"When I went out there, I found the little  Oompa-Loompas living in tree houses."
They had to live in tree houses  to escape from the whangdoodles and the hornswogglers  and the snozzwangers.
They were practically starving to death.
"And they were living on green caterpillars,  and the caterpillars tasted revolting, and the Oompa-Loompas spent every moment  of their days climbing through the treetops"
looking for anything to mix with the caterpillars to make them taste better.
The one food that they longed for  more than any other was the cacao bean.
(Laughter)
But they couldn't get it.
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky  if he found 3 or 4 cacao beans a year.
"But oh, how they craved them."
Listen to this:
"Charlotte Greenwood, also all together than with Jack Haley, frozen faced comedian of stage and screen, and charming Cobina Wright, Jr."

"Barbara, you still wanna go through with it, don't you?"

"After all the McNeill Steel Works, you know?"
Some girls will put up with an awful lot if a fella's got money.
"Yes, is it awful?"
I could never understand.
We're going to have a wonderful life together.
"Where will we live, darling?"
Where would you like to live?
"Oh, anywhere."
Cozy little hut is good enough for me.
"Oh me, oh mi-ami"

You'll celebrate a brand of love
I go round in a trance

"Well, the first seven questions on Assignment [unknown], all focus on the precise use of language."
"So, I'll let you discuss those with the other students."
They're all at about the same place.
And with these bubbles...
"This isn't a video, the bubbles represent figures from a database that draw this diagram."
But I can still pull everything around.
That's the genius of the program.
We can choose specific bubbles and I can go to 1964 and the hostilities between Vietnam and the United States.
If I eliminate the other countries we see only Vietnam and the US.
Al Gore grabbed me and said:
And that was Al Gore!
Then Google's founders Sergei Brin and Larry Page approached me.
They wanted to talk some more and invited Ola and Anna to Google.
Rosling 's son Ola and his wife Anna developed the animated graphics along with three others.
Now they all have jobs at Google.
Google also bought the software for millions.
The money became the basis of the non-profit Gapminder foundation.
Today eight people collect data on development and distribute it free.
For example on video.

There was a gender conference on Sunday.
"Then I flew to the US and talked in Portland and at Google's AGM, called Zeitgeist, in San Francisco."
Then I was home...

Then I head for Washington for the World Philanthropy Forum.
"Headed by Bill Clinton, they donate money to global development."
"You meet a lot of people, but do you feel you influence development?"
"Yes, because people gain a greater understanding of statistics."
And then they feel very happy here.
And I am happy when I see they are happy.
What impresses me the most is the credit from my customers.
"Before, when we were still not ready to open the fish-watching area."
Sometimes the customers would complain about us.
"But then later, after two or three months, the customers came back again"
He said
"I would like to come back, because I appreciate your service attitude"
This made me very happy
I was so touched.
Then all what they used to complain or even scold at me is nothing to me at all.
"With their credit and appreciation, I feel I need to work harder."
I should work harder to have the people see what we own.
"Here these ""screws"" got much ""torture"" from us"

And also we give them much pressure
"But from all this, you can see, from the first year, the second year, to the third year......"
"Everybody has improved himself gradually, everyone"
"Little by little, they are not afraid of approaching people"
"Gradually, they become more willing to try new things"
"Before, they always said, ""No, I don't want, I can't"""
We are happy when we see they are changing their attitude gradually.
These employees have grown up.

That I learn what I didn't know
That a tour guide shows me a Like!

"Where other scientists would play in their laboratory,"
Tesla created his inventions in his mind.
NT:
"To my delight, I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility."
MT:
"And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination, he would build them in his workshop."
NT:
"I needed no models, drawings or experiments."
"I could picture them as real in my mind, and there I run it, test it and improve it."
Only then do I construct it.
MT:
His great idea was alternating current.
But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe?
"To sell his idea, he became a showman."
NT:
"We are at the dawn of a new age, the age of electricity."
"I have been able, through careful invention, to transmit, with the mere flick of a switch, electricity across the ether."
It is the magic of science.
(Applause)
"Tesla has over 700 patents to his name: radio, wireless telegraphy, remote control, robotics."
He even photographed the bones of the human body.
"But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream: harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls, and bringing light to the city."
But Tesla's success didn't last.
NT:
I had bigger ideas.
Illuminating the city was only the beginning.
"A world telegraphy center -- imagine news, messages, sounds, images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly."
MT:
It's a great idea; it was a huge project.
"Expensive, too."
NT:
They wouldn't give me the money.
lots of opportunities for students.
Beth Seaton:
That's wonderful.
So tell me how you're involving students in the project.
Win Phippen:
Great!
"A lot of private seed companies, breeding seed companies, especially for corn and soybeans, are trying to get students re-energized about the field of plant breeding."
"And so this grant allows for students to do internship projects, and that's on the entire summer, time to work with these private companies."
"And so, this year, we have four interns."
One is at Pioneer Hybrid
Another one is over at Iowa State University.
And another one is with the USDA in Peoria.
And I have another one here at Western.
"And another one that is at the University of illinois,"
learning about bio-energy crops.
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Tell me about why plant breeding is important to the USDA and to the general population.
Because I don't really know too much about plant breeding.
Win Phippen:
"Well, a plant breeder is the person who takes undomesticated plants."
These are plants that haven't been considered for commercial production.
"Let's say a plant has a very strong, sort of, pharmaceutical properties to it."
And we want to a...
"Instead of trying to synthetically make in the labs, sometimes it is easier to have the plants produce these particular compunds."
Beth Seaton:
Okay.
Win Phippen:
"And so the plant breeder is the one who would go out in the wild, collect up the wild plants of these particular species, and they'd start doing some crosses."
And they would try to make different combinations of these plants to create a plant that would be suitable for commerical production.

If people better understand what's happening in the world they can make better decisions.
Whether they run a company or are activists wanting a new world or are members of a government.
Everyone needs to know how the world looks.
TED Conference Los Angeles 2009
Hans's theme:
8 minutes on HlV
The HlV problem in Africa is not due to poverty.
"The poorer you are, the lower the risk of your having HlV."
The richer part of the continent has more HlV than the poorer.
We don't know why HlV is so common in eastern and southern Africa.
In Ghana less than 3% are infected and in Senegal less than 1%.
But sexual differences between cultures is a sensitive issue so no one does research into it.
They research other things instead.
- Is it a cultural issue?
- It's probably multiple partners.
In parts of southern and eastern Africa the majority of the adult population has 2-3 sex partners.
"It's not that it's a cultural norm or rule, but it is accepted."
There are cultural roots and it's accepted.
It's also related to the fact that sex is a bartering tool.
When you sell your maize you offer sexual favors to raise the price.
Let's see if I...
We've got a lot of information here.
This is very important...
"A yearbook photo, 7th grade class at the Domarringen school."
This is Agneta Thordeman.
We went to school together and have lived together for 40 years.
She started working in healthcare early on and that got me interested.
I decided to apply to medical school.
"In 1972, halfway through med school"
Hans and Agneta took a trip to India.
Visiting medical students in Bangalore
Hans Rosling became aware of his own prejudices about the world.
- You cannot even touch her shadow.
You said I cant even touch her shadow?
I am going to marry Shailu.
Venkat weds Shailaja.
If anybody try to obstruct Venkat kills anybody.
I like you O Nijam girl and you are my princess
Welcome my dear prince and take this young beauty with you
If you give me your hand I will take.. ..you atop the elephant with me
Arrange for the musical band for our marriage.
I will come with you
This girl has eagerly accepted my proposal
Let us come together and steal each others hearts
Talk sweetly and open the treasure of my beauty
You too became intelligent
Because you pampered me
I laid a path of jasmines for you.
Come to me running
I heart found the priest of love and could not escape from him
Be the deity in the temple of my heart
I am intoxicated with your love and come to you
I will blow away with you like a gale
My shyness became an hurdle
I will drive it away by kissing your cheek
Drown me with your kisses and lift me in your embrace
Become the beautiful day once and a lovely night once
We must be exited each time we embrace
I lost all my prestige.
"When he was kissing you in front of your father.. ..and everybody, you didnt say a single word."
She is being ecstatic about it.
You took an oath by your mother.. ..does he became important than her?
I took oath of mom that I will act in movies not to forget him.
It is unnecessary for me to live any more.
Insults are always a sign of inability
"Happens a lot, For example when a guy tries to get the girl"
"Nothing happens, so he tries to insult her"
Hi baby.
Let's Dance
"Sorry, no ..."
Sl*t
"Insults are really just empty air, We should not pay attention to them...."
Completely!
"Who understands it, it's mpossible to hurt him"
But there are those who take the harsh words in their direction
"For them, it is better to understand thay insults are lies and complex of the offender or the meanness of offending"
"Indeed, how low you need to go if you insult someone weak"
So you're rose above him.
Laughed and forgot
But he remembered and stepped out the window
"Maybe I'm exaggerating,But the essence is clear"
"By the way, is often not only an insult."
And by praise you can understand human values
Someone praises a rich businessman.
And translation:
Yeah cool I also aspire to be like this
"Someone praises a monk, sitting in a monastery And a similar translation:"
I aspire to be like that
But when one praises the monk but reproaches the one that praises the businessman
It's only a clash of values.Full stop
Therefore such criticisms should pass by you
Because this is for you.
That it for him.
Different issues
"Better still, to heal each other with words."
Simply and bluntly
Not the best idea.

No!

Welcome to the latest edition of Inside CBA.
So many great things have been happening here in the College of Business Administration that I though the best way to convey them is through video so you can literally see for yourself.
"In September, the Nebraska Board of Regents approved plans for our new 240,000 square foot building."
This 84 million dollar project will be privately funded.
"In 2016 when the building's completed, we'll have a facility that will allow us to attract students and faculty from around the world and help us with our growing enrollments."
This fall our freshmen enrollments exploded by a 25.4 percent increase over last year.
And our first time transfer students were up by almost 16 percent.
"Our goal as a college is to hit $5,000 students in accordance with the chancellors charge that UNL's total enrollment should reach 30,000 by 2017."
Size matters.
"For our undergraduate program, enhancing the size of the student body and the faculty provide greater opportunities to find their niche, to locate a mentor who can direct them to their passion, to explore a wider set of opportunities than they can imagine when they graduate from high school."
I'm going to a party with Hollywood folks.
And I'm going to wear this.
We got the name Gapminder from the London underground.
American hotels almost always have an iron in every room so you can look your best.
A little note for Agneta...
There...
It's a new phase of a strange journey for Hans Rosling.
From a doctor in Africa to a professor of international health and most recently a global star with an unusual message:
The world is actually getting better.
He's on his way back to the scene of his breakthrough.
"It's California's ""Davos"" meeting, where Silicon Valley meets Hollywood."
The room is full of key people of industry and entertainment.
From movie stars to film producers.
"The conference is called Technology, Entertainment and Design."
I was invited to it in 2006 and it changed my life.
Yesterday the WHO's statistics manager e-mailed me after I'd requested malaria statistics.
He wrote:
"""I always send your video to my friends, of course I'll help."""
"If I count the number of minutes I've been teaching, this video teaches more than anything I've done in my life."
"All the articles, books, courses..."
None of it can compare with this one video.
That's a humbling experience.
Uppsala University wanted a course in global development.
"The ""Man and Nature"" course had students from many fields."
"Their worldview was cartoonish - really ""us and them""."
They were convinced that no one should touch rainforests.
"That we have to lower our standards, not everyone can have electricity."
I was horrified at their attitude and lack of knowledge.
They thought developing countries lived in harmony in the rain forest.
Only a fraction of so-called devel- oping countries live that way.
So I did a graph with money on one axis and child mortality on the other.
"The idea of ""industrial"" and ""developing"" countries is bullshit."
"I'm looking at a list of your published articles, doctor."
You've been quite busy and prolific.
"So based on your time spent with Holy Roller snake-handlers... ...voodoo priestesses and Indians tripping on peyote buds... ...based on observing these bizarre individuals... ...you've concluded that possession is... ...a basic, typical human experience?"
"I must say, counselor... ...that's quite a laundry list of disdain... ...and one that thoroughly mischaracterizes my research."
"No, I don't think possession is a typical experience."
But I am convinced that it is a scientifically verified... ...culturally universal one.
Have you ever used Gambutrol in your studies... ...to test your theory about its effect on the possession experience?
Absolutely not.
That would be dangerous to the patient.
"So this notion of Gambutrol locking someone in a possessed state... ...the key to your assertion that her medical treatment harmed Emily... ...this would be your own pet theory, correct?"
- You're just making this one up?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
Sustained.
"Although I think he's just taking a page from your book, counselor."
No further questions.
Erin!
I've got a doctor who wants to testify.
"He's an eyewitness, Erin."
He was there.
He was at the exorcism.
- What?
- He called us.
"Dr. Graham Cartwright, Department of Abnormal Psychiatry... ...at St. Mary's Hospital."
Dr. Cartwright.
Ring a bell?
Yes.
He was there?
- Yes.
"- Father... ...if you want me to defend you, you've got to give me... ...all the information I need."
With all of this medical testimony helping the prosecution... ...how could you not tell me that a doctor attended the exorcism?
He asked that I keep his involvement confidential... ...and I said I would.
"This means I'm standing here on stage facing you,"
"And you are in the audience, in your seats, facing me."
You see the first row in the photo from the top here.
This is a photo of the model that the architects built for the contest.
"The building changed a little during construction, but basically it still looks as you can see here."
This is a photo of the National Theater of Somalia in Mogadishu.
This building has been constructed by Chinese people in the 60ies.
It was a gift of Mao to the young state Somalia.
Therefor Mao-Bibles have been provided at the opening celebration 1967 for each visitor.
"There was a page marked, when you opened it,"
There was a quotation from Mao:
"An army without culture is an uninformed army,"
And an uniformed army can be defeated.
A photo of the opening celebration.
The photographer took this picture on the 4th of May 2012 from a steep perspective.
Therefor you can see the stage tower well.
"From the stage, where I'm standing up to the rooftop are about 14 meters."
This equates roughly the height of the opera-house in Bayreuth.
The only difference is that this theater here is located in the heart of the city.
"Because of the angle which the photographer chose, you can see the prospect hanging there."
"This is the stage desgin of the opening play, which hase been written especially for this occasion."
You can see 4 persons hugging each other.
"At the back up in the sky, here, this is the white star from the flag of Somalia."
This flag resembles the flag of the UN.
It has been designed that way as gratitude to the UN for their aid.
The play has been written for this occasion.
It is called Dalaarwin Walid -
Dadaarwin Walid.
This means advices by the parents.
And this is a play about love.
"Somalia is a country in the east of Africa, which doesn't exist anymore."
"Anyway not as a state, because it fell apart in more than 20 years of civil war."
And this is why chocolate  is associated with longevity.
"If you recall, there was a great book written years ago, which we're gonna look at"
"""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
"And the Oompa Loompa's had brilliant pearly white strong teeth, because chocolate is great for your teeth."
Chocolate toothpaste is coming.
"This is what the cacao bean looks like  when you break it open, when you break it  into the different pieces."
"And those are called nibs, and these products are available  here in Finland now."
And all over the world.
Raw chocolate products --  in fact this industry is now over a hundred million dollar industry.
And it all came from one moment when I bit into raw cacao bean.
"And for the last 8.5 years,"
I've been proselytizing  about the power of chocolate all over the place.
In fact it never stops.
Some people complain about that.
"Anyway, iconically chocolate is associated with wonder and magic."
"And if you see that giant head back there, that's an Olmec head."
They're the ones who originated the word cacao.
"And you can see the bird in this image as well, indicating that connection between birds  in that realm and chocolate."
"Chocolate, as I discovered when I was studying in Oaxaca Mexico, is added to guacamole, but not process chocolate, raw chocolate."
They take the crushed up nibs  and they put it in their guacamole.
Try it at home.
"I was fortunate I grew up in California with Mexican people, and I was in love with guacamole  from an early time."
What an amazing thing  to have your cuisine expanded.
And that's what we're doing with chocolate.
"I got so into chocolate, I started growing chocolate."
This is my chocolate nursery in Hawaii.
"I have a farm in Canada,  I have a farm in Hawaii."
And the purpose of that farm in Hawaii  is to grow chocolate and explore the mystery and magic  of this great plant.
I grew that chocolate tree from seed.
Such an amazing amount of learning  can come from growing plants.
You can learn more from a garden  many times then you can from a book.
"I was very, very excited to explore."

There IS a way we can collectively fight back against environmentally destructive multinational corporations.
"A coordinated global general strike and boycott, combined with personal preparedness, in sufficient numbers, can cause a great deal of economic disruption."
The best tactic?

I'm here with Dr. Agus who is a professor of engineering and medicine here at USC.
We're looking at pictures of things that seem very different to me.
What is the commonality?
Dr:
The commonality is inflammation.
"Inflammation can be manifested by a runny nose or the flu, it could be manifested by an infection in your toes, it could be hitting your head playing football, or hitting your arm when you fall while playing a sport"
All of those can cause inflammation.
S:
Inflammation has a certain meaning in everyday language:
It means something is swollen and red.
But here we're talking about inflammation in the medical or scientific sense where it's not things are swollen and red BECAUSE of inflammation.
Dr:
Right.
S:
So what is inflammation?
It isn't just swollen and redness.
Football players get red and swollen.
Dr:
Inflammation occurs when your body senses danger.
"So when something is wrong--whether it be infection, whether it be trauma--in the case of football players your body senses danger and sends in its front-line soldiers which are its immune cells in order to fight whatever is causing it."
"So, if it's trauma, the immune cells go in there and they help rebuild the tissue that is damaged."
"If it's bacteria, they go in there and try to take away the bacteria so you can get over that cold or that flu."
"So, that whole process is what we call inflammation, it's the ""danger process""."
S:
So the immune cells go to the site of danger to either fight the danger itself or repair the aftermath of the danger.
That sounds like a good thing!
Dr:
It's an awesome thing.
"It was nice, thank you."
The Inclusive Design Research Centre is focused  on designing for diversity.
"We try to design with, rather than designing for."
We believe that we will have greater designs for diversity and more innovative designs when there are multiple perspectives.
Our research is intended to help everyone.
A 3D printer is a printer that prints stuff - physical stuff.
It will enable everyone to basically have the equivalent of a little factory in their own home.
"Well, my name is Judith Snow."
"It's not really so much how the Institute has helped me, as it is I'm a participant."
Inclusion brings out a lot of value in society.
"This place is all about the structures of that, making inclusion actually work, so nobody's left behind."
Ontario is probably one of the most diverse communities in the world.
We are a world leader in things like accessibility legislation.
"What we're creating here is potentially an economic driver for Ontario, so that the world can come here to receive innovative solutions for designing for diversity, or for digital inclusion."
"I went to Eton, paid a lot for knowledge"
I joined the Bullingdon at Brasenose College that's where I caught his eye
He told me that his dad was loaded
"I said, 'Mine too, we should run this country!'"
"He said, 'Yah.'"
"And in 30 seconds time, I realised"
I'll need the votes of common people
I must pretend to do the things that common people do
Then I'll shit on the common people
Then I'll shit on common people like you
What else would I do?
I'm a Tory.
That's what we do
So I became MP for Witney
"It was an easy seat, I had to start it somewhere"
So I started there
I met some people who had no money
"I laughed and laughed, and said, 'Ha!"
And it came up again not long ago too.
ST:
"Yes, we have the ""ideologically similar"" media, although I find the phrase unfortunate."
JL:
I don't want to be there.
"I mean, if there is media which is ideologically similar or different"
I don't want to be on the list of the ideologically similar media outlets.
ST:
"I'd like you to tell me about the best experience you have had since the 15th, and the worst experience."
And here we can move on to these things.
JL:
There have been three best moments.
"One when I was streaming with the telephone and I saw there were thousands of people connected to my streaming with my bloody telephone. and I said ""what's happening?"""
"But especially when I turned off the streaming, or the network collapsed or something, and I put down my mobile and looked not through the screen, because I was really stressed out."
I was knackered.
"But I put down the mobile to rest a moment and I thought ""Blimey, something's happening here"""
"I mean, something big is happening here, that's what I thought at that moment."
"And that's actually the headline I used in my chronicle that night, then I changed it, but the URL is still ""something big is happening here""."
Because that's what I felt.
"I didn't know what is was, but it was big."
That was the first big impression I got.
The second moment was when I started to see the cardboards in the square.
When they put cardboard on the ground so everyone could sleep.
And they started to
"""carpet"" the Puerta del Sol, that was the second time that I thought something big was happening."
"I mean, they were carpeting the ground so they could sleep there!"
"It's an image that's fixed, after that came the blue carps, the distribution of the commissions, the infrastructure, the firefighters helping out... the construction of the Medina de Sol."
But the first moment
I realised they were building a city was when I saw the cardobard on the floor.
"And I saw people were going to stay there, lots of people."
ST:
"I remember an image, let's see if I can describe it."
No!
They are going to know.
"Then, no!"
They are going to know.
Have We not made the earth a resting place?
And the mountains as stakes?
And We created you in pairs..
And made your sleep [a means for] rest..
And made the night as clothing..
And made the day for livelihood..
And constructed above you seven strong [heavens]
MashAllah Tabarak AlRahman
"When we meet these people, especially those with special needs we find in ourselves.. honestly in myself and yours.."
"The lack towards the speech of Allah we can see and the Quran is right infront of us, and our FlRST language is Arabic"
"Allah says:And is it not sufficient for them that We revealed to you the Book which is recited to them? yet we still keep away from Quran, some of us read the Quran only in Ramadan, and some of us does not want to memorize the Quran and he knows that the Quran is easy to memorize."
Look at all these examples that was brought your way!
We now want from you to start with your children in helping them memorize the Quran. and you should also memorize too.
"Memorizing the Quran, Reciting the Quran and prefecting it because"
"BY ALLAH, this Quran will be with us OR against us on the Day of Judgment. especially for those who know the Arabic language, those who have been blessed with their sight, their hearing and their tongue"
By Allah we will not succeed.. and will not find blessing except by the Quran.
I ask Allah to Allow us to complete this show and through these great examples - motivate you to memorize the Quran.
You and whoever is around you.
Ameen.
"""I can't seem to get this paper right!"""
"""Having trouble with your writing, Timmy?"
"Have you tried the writing center?"""
"""The writing center?"
"What's that?"""
"""Why Timmy, the writing center is a free opportunity for you to improve your writing skills!"
You don't need an appointment and it's located right in the tunnel.
"Our excellent staff will be glad to help you at any stage of your writing."""
"""Wow!"
"Our porch served as a place to relax, for meals, nargilla, the dining room"
"Here are the stairs, here was the dormitory, two rooms, 30 guys- our first class."
This is where the Mechina began.
"We were told, ""There's a kindergarten about to be abandoned, not far away, just as the municipality promised us."
It wasn't clear if we were suppossed to get both classrooms or just one.
"In the end, the kindergarten emptied and we added caravans."
Here were the sports area and a mini obstacle course
Here was the climbing rope
"Everyone who came to the Mechina knew that by the end of the year, he'll reach the top of the rope."
"In the end, after 5 amazing years in Kiryat Malachi, the Mechina had to move on."
"We came here, to the Shafir area."
We had study partners at the local school.
They told me all the time to check out the Mechina program.
"I came thinking I'd be here for a week or two, and then move on to the army.."
I had no intention to stay..
I wanted to just go straight into the army without thinking too much.
"I didn't even think for a moment about life processes, yeshiva."
Not even for a moment.
"My thinking at the beginning of the year was to come to the Mechina, do my psychometric tests, and then immediately apply for the Atuda program, without any thoughts of staying"
I came to the Mechina
And I see great guys great Rabbis who love us for who we are.
You see the warmth here.
I saw that this Mechina is more special than the other Mechinot I saw.
Gili was a Platoon Commander in the Tank Corp.
They were called to go to Ramallah.
They asked Gili and his platoon to enter the junction in order to attract the gunfire away from the infantry.
This is what saved them.
They told him it was enough but he insisted on going in again.
One bullet penetrated the earpiece on his helmet and killed him.
"About a year after Gil was killed, a major donor of the Mechina, Sandy Kolb asked us if we would agree that the Beit Midrash be named after Gili."
This is how we got to know Rav Boaz and Naftali Kendler.
Their self-sacrifice is close in my heart to the self-sacrifice exhibited by Gil to his soldiers.
"Unique, modern, innovative religion is ..."
"Unique, modern, innovative religion is ... ...."
MONEY!
"And different currencies are as Catholic and Christian religions, Protestantism, Buddhism, Judaism"
Literally money as your god.
"We all believe in them, they are the source of everything and may occasionally perform miracles."
"And this God has his disciples, sacred millionaires ... .."
Which you so enthusiastically studying.
Here also you do systematic rituals of divine society getting the envelope with piece of the sacred body
"And ask anyone, just for fun .."
"""How much money you get?"""
They gonna shit their pants as if you ask for confession
And what's the story with this banknotes?
They are the holy icons.
"You are looking at them and for you they are not just paper and ink, no ..."
For you are the body of your god
"Which arise in a sacred place, which can't access any common mortal."
"And these sacred scraps of paper fall into the hands of people and then tired, wrinkled and dirty .. ..."
"Burn in the incinerator to be reborn again, like the phoenix"
To do their earth's path.
We all touching them.
Take out your wallet.
Can you imagine the path each banknote have done? ...
To get your hands.
Who was the first who rinkle that?
Where they are going?
"One with syphilis, a prostitute, a prime minister and you ... ..."
Wiping with the same piece of paper.
People c'mon.... wake up ..
Circulation of money used to give money your power
Since the value of money means your work
And without it money do not cost anything.
"Convicted, that's correct."
JG:
"You write in the preface,"
"""It had been and is my view that it was the racism in Middlesex County, fueled by biased, inflammatory publicity in the local press before and throughout the trial, fanned by the documented government lawlessness, that made it possible for the white jury to convict Assata on the uncorroborated, contradictory, and generally incredible testimony of trooper Harper, the only other witness to the events on the turnpike."""
"There was one other state trooper, Harper, who survived the confrontation and who was the main witness against Assata."
LH:
"Yeah, but Harper ran away during the shootout, came back, and his story was conflicted and contradictory."
And—
"Yeah, it all comes down to tapping buttons."
Which brings us to our next accessory.
Probably the stupidest thing ever invented: the Speedboard.
What is it?
It's a piece of fucking plastic!
You attach your controller.
You get it?
In case you don't want to hold the controller with your hands?
"In case you enjoy playing on the floor, or behind a table?"
Then this is for you.
It's embarrassing.
What's the point?
To put the speed at your fingers?
Why in the ass would I need that?
"If I'm playing a game that involves having to tap the buttons like crazy,"
"I'm probably gonna get a turbo controller,"
like the NES Max or NES Advantage.
How could they even sell such a thing?
"Even though it's made by a third-party company, it was actually licensed by Nintendo."
It's like covering a turd in ice cream sprinkles.
"Next up, oh boy, the Konami LaserScope."
Now I just wanna go on record by saying I fuckin' love Konami.
But this thing reeks of ass!
"It's essentially yet another form of the Zapper, but it's voice-controlled."
"After medical care and observation,"
Maxine explores her new freedom at Farm Sanctuary.
I've seen that like a hundred times and I still get goosebumps.
"It's simple, you know."
It is unnecessary.
It doesn't have to be this way.
You change your perception.
You change the story.
"That's all it is, the changing of the story."
"And we cannot wait for other people to do it, we have to do it ourselves."
"Every animal wants to live, every animal wants to live, and no animal wants to experience pain."
"If you guys want more information, you can always email me at james@arff.org"
You can visit our website for all of this information www.arff.org
"We are giving these presentations throughout the year, this is on obviously every last Sunday of the month"
I give this presentations here at Sublime 536-30
"But also, we go to juvenile detention centers, we go to high schools."
"We do other many different presentations on different subjects as well, right now I am spending most of my time in camps."
"It has been very nice not to have to say, ""If you can hear my voice, clap once"". or ""Do not put that in your mouth or your ear."""
"So yes, if you want more information about what we do, all these presentations are free."
They're all for free.
We give them free.
"So if you are interested in having a presentation at your school, if you're a teacher, at some community event that you might be running, we do everything."
It doesn't matter what it is.
"Birthday parties,"
"Bar Mitzvah, Bat Mitzvah, circumcision."
Maybe not the circumcision.
"Also I do want to say, there is a lot of information out there, we have starter kits, we have ""why vegan?""."
It's a talk about the ethical aspect of veganism.
There is also again more information on the Animal Rights Foundation
This is a card.
"This has a list of all the veg friendly restaurants in South Florida, Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, definitely take one of these."
It's all out there on the table.

"Oo, I've got wine coolers!"
"Over here, baby."
Oh!
I want a Zima!
Make sure everybody has Zimas!
"don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease"
I be in my house trying to think about what I'm gonna eat because I'm fuckin' starving and somebody knocks on my fucking door with his little dawg
"looking like ducks man they pissing me off cuz they knocking hard waking up my mother waking up my daughter now they got my exploding why the f*ck they knocking 8 o'clock in the morning that sh*t ain't funny so i walk to the door carrying a potato on the left hand carrying a potato nigga I'm trying to make burrito i know that's what you thinking get your mind right not your mind left don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease don't you just hate it when you trying to chill this people always trying to disturb the peace no foods, no drinks, but left the grease i swear this people act like fleas disease"
"As a magician, I'm always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion."
"And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century."
It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage.
"Now, I won't use mirrors, but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater."
So let the story begin.
"On a dark and stormy night -- really! -- it was the 10th of July, 1856."
"Lightning lit the sky, and a baby was born."
"His name was Nikola,"
Nikola Tesla.
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy.
Let me show you.
"Tesla, what is 236 multiplied by 501?"
Nikola Tesla:
"The result is 118,236."
Marco Tempest:
Now Tesla's brain worked in the most extraordinary way.
"When a word was mentioned, an image of it instantly appeared in his mind."
Tree.
Chair.
Girl.
"They were hallucinations, which vanished the moment he touched them."
Probably a form of synesthesia.
But it was something he later turned to his advantage.
"Fan: ""and back"""
The Red Line stops just outside the ballparks 35th Street is the stop for U.S. Cellular.
Addison is the stop for Wrigley.
What could be more convenient and fun than a train full of like-minded fans?
How about a bus full of fans?
The #152 Addison bus drops fans just feet from the friendly confines... ...as does the #22 Clark and #8 Halsted.
The #35 35th street and 39 Pershing buses offer front door service to U.S. Cellular.
The CTA once again has commemorative fare cards and posters for this year's Crosstown series.
The posters have become sought-after souvenirs ever since they were first introduced in 1998
"This year's poster features the unsung heroes of the ballpark, the hot dog vendors."
Let's be frank.
Grilled meat and cold beverages are as much a part of the ball park experience as the game itself.
"""Exactly."
"It's part of the atmosphere, its part of the environment."""
Steve Musgrave is an illustrator who has created twelve Crosstown series posters for the CTA.
The 2010 poster is a whimsical departure from past depictions of ball players.
"""I appreciate the fact the CTA was open to doing something a little more playful than a baseball player- so it's a hot dog vendor."""
"Steve's first CTA gig was a series of baseball-themed paintings that adorn the Addison ""L"" station"
"Now, his posters adorn countless walls in and across Chicago. "" I really enjoy it, it's a lot of fun..."
"Some people collect them and some go out of their way to pick them up, which is nice to see."""
"""I'm a big fan of earlier 20th century European poster design kind of a streamlined or deco look."""
"""Every time I design them I picture them on some kid's wall, what I would have done with them as a kid."""
And how does he decide whether to put Cubs versus Sox ... or Sox versus Cubs?
"""Whoever hosts the games first gets the top billing."""
"Prior to each game of the series, CTA employees distribute the posters as long as supplies last."
"The commemorative farecards are available for purchase in CTA vending machines across the system, throughout the month of June or while supplies last."
Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone
He's on the run
And your Daddy's here
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful"
Then we released the video showing the slaying of two Reuters journalists and 18 other people in Baghdad.
"And that application was canceled for what judges, two judges involved tell us is for political reasons."
So it really is important to have a diverse funding base that is built around the interests of people and not organizations that are busy in power plays.
"I'm sorry, and your first question was...?"
"If you see your example, you're setting an example that more media put more resources into investigative reporting from war zones."
You mention the example of Sy Hersh and the My Lai Massacre.
"I spoke to Sy Hersh about this last year and, while many people have heard of the My Lai Massacre as the sort of archetypical example of abuse exposed in Viet Nam, what people probably don't know is that Sy Hersh couldn't get that story out, that he wrote, submitted it to the New York Times, the Washington Post, etc. and it was not accepted."
Rachel and Clare Wallmeyer are identical twins.
"They were beautiful, bright, straight A students."
"Then, when they were 14, suddenly their perfect world collapsed."
"Kilo by kilo, the twins began wasting away."
"And for the next 20 years, they'd struggled with a deadly disease."
One that affects thousands of Australian teenagers - Anorexia.
Now the twins are 34 and they are literally just skin and bones.
"They still live together, still share everything including, tragically, a death wish."
"Quite simply, they've given up on life."
"Thank goodness, not everyone has given up on them."
"Identical twins, Clare and Rachel Wallmeyer are running out of time."
Their lives have been ruined by anorexia and now they are literally starving themselves to death.
"""We are living, solely, [for] anorexia."
It's a horror.
"We live to die."""
"""It's been a constant pain to wake up everyday and not being able to get out of bed."
We're so tired.
"Everything's a struggle and there's no point."""
Rachel and Clare run to lose weight.
"This obsessive training is all part of their illness, an illness they've been fighting for 20 years."
Interviewer:
"""Rachel, how much do you weigh?"""
Rachel:
"""About 32 and a half kilos."""
Interviewer:
She said that Father Moore had suggested she stop taking the drug.
"And what, in your medical opinion... ...was the result of Father Moore's suggestion?"
I believe Father Moore's suggestion killed her.
"Objection, Your Honor!"
The witness is asserting outrageous conclusions based on pure hearsay.
"Technically correct, but I'll allow it as part of his expert opinion testimony."
"Thank you, Dr. Mueller."
Your witness.
You said you observed a possible epileptic focus in the temporal lobe.
Doesn't this imply what you observed may not have been an epileptic focus?
"Yes, that's also possible."
"Would Father Moore's advice to stop taking Gambutrol be good advice... ...if Emily were, in fact, not epileptic?"
Of course.
But that's not the case here.
She was epileptic.
Really.
When Emily saw objects move on their own... ...and felt an invisible presence on top of her... ...was she experiencing symptoms typical of epilepsy?
"Not typical, no."
Are they typical indications of any other conditions?
"- Say, for example, psychosis?"
"- Yes, I would say that's correct."
But isn't psychosis an entirely different medical condition from epilepsy?
"- Yes, in my..."
- So aren't you selectively choosing... ...what parts of Emily's experiences fit your epilepsy diagnosis... ...while ignoring those which indicate something else?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Withdrawn.
No further questions.
We have to work fast.
They're only giving me an hour with you tonight.
Listen.
"Before we get started, there's something I have to tell you... ...something I should've said to you before I let you take the case."
"It's just an ounce of prevention, worth a pound of cure."
"Especially when it comes to keeping one of these precious, lovely children alive."
Let's go through the answer together.
"We definitely want to name our procedure t_string, and now the real trick to this is just writing a good regular expression."
"Here I've written a regular expression that starts with a double quote, ends with a double quote, and can have anything that's not a double quote-- remember that super useful carat character--0 or more times."

"Dear Thay, dear friends, dear family, such a happy moment to be up here  and look down."
"Just to know that our togetherness  for the common purpose of education, this brings me a lot of happiness."
I know that so many students  will benefit from this.
"That awareness really fills my body up, my heart, I am filled."
"I think, just that, already  gives me a lot of hope, a lot of trust."
"Thank you for coming here,  freeing time to be with us."
It is very precious.
"Today, we have a few wonderful friends."
We've got together already just to know what they will share.
"I am just grateful that they agree  to come here to share their experiences in the practice,  in bringing mindfulness, bringing the practice into the areas that they are involved with."
I will sit up here just to be a time keeper.
I have the big bell here.
(Laughter)
"It is not threatening,  it is peace."
"But I will, once in a while,  remind our friends here."
Because their stories  are very inspirational.
"And of course,  we live in a ... (inaudible)"
"Our brothers and sisters, and Thay, in the Plum Village community, we took the initiative to bring  mindfulness into education, maybe 3, 4 years ago."
Thay wanted to secularize the practice and bring it into society.
"But keeping who we are,  which is monastics, we are in a spiritual tradition,  Buddhist based, and so on."
Now Mister Morton is happy and Pearl and the cat are too.
"They're the subjects of the sentence and what the predicate says, they do."
Are you a hardworking artist?
I think I'm a hardworker but at the sametime I'm lazy.
"I usually wake up, get rest, watch tv, do nothing."
Then in few hours I can work more than enough and finish everything.
I can't say that it's racked my brain
"Well there must be something, it's all done by yourself, but I'm sure it's also improvised."
There's not a certain subject nor story.
These are not message giving drawings.
Usually there's a main subject.
"Not in all, but some of them"
"Some are very simple ideas, and some are about very personal things that even I might be embarresed to tell."
I usually think how to deformate an idea onto the drawing.
"For example it can be read from this side, and if we look at it from this side, it can be something completely different."
I try to take an idea in this way as well.
"while trying to draw for example a house or a castle, there are several technics, academical or perspective..."
"For example, here the castle can symbolise a room but I don't think what symbolizes the room."
I have fun when it becomes something different with the free angle.
It's like I make some rules and actually I play a game.
Colors.. .
I have my own color restrictions and I don't pay attention to do them at the same time or to let them be in an harmony.
"As I said before, between the years 2007 and 2008,"
"I've been in a period of searching and all these pictures came out afterall, which made me really happy."
"If a pshycologist would come and see these drawings, he or she might evaluate, analyse and say something about them."
"And the result might show the truth about me, but I don't think about it too much,"
"I only try to keep myself in a positive way, self-enclosed."
Since few years I've been reading William S. Burroughs and interested in Beat Literature...
"Lately he has written the book called ""My Education"" where he talks about his dreams."
"I read it sometimes, it became one of my favorites..."
The name of this exhibition comes likely from there.
"Actually there are less handwritings than my past works, and signutares are bigger."

Hi My name is Colleen Hall-Patton and I am your teacher/faciliator for this semester.
I thought that you should probably have some idea who you're dealing with not all of these are going to be video recordings but we will start with this so you at least have some idea who I am.
A little bit of background about me to begin with is I have a PH.D. in Sociology from UNLV in 2004 took me ten years to do that so those of you on the long track on this I empathize.
A Bachelors and Masters Degree in Anthropology and so I take kind of a more world view of things and across cultural sort of view on stuff.
I have been teaching Women's Studies at UNLV since 1999 while I was still a graduate student and I think in Women's Studies especially it is important to know the placement of where you are or a person is in various hierarchies.
So here's mine.
I am came of age in the 1970's at kind of the height of optimism on changes on the second women's movement.
I am married had been for 35 years.
Which I don't think I am old enough to be married that long but there it is.
Two kids who are both young adults. and I had a 25 year career in Information Technology and switched over to teaching full time in 2003.
So that's kind of a background of where we are on this.
"In terms of the class, the class is organized in modules 1 for each week and our book has 13 chapters so we've got 13 chapters over 15 weeks."
"In this we have a life time of experience doing gender, race, class, ability even though we may not recognize that we do and of course our experiences are all unique."
Recommendations for this class is stay on top of the work.
"Do the work for the week in the week, contribute to the discussions that's going to our primary place of talking to each other."
I will be in out of them as well.
You learn through participation.
You learn from the other students.
"A food that's archetypically connected with winning the golden ticket, that's connected with prosperity."
"I was taken on a rocket ride across the universe in a voyage of discovery  that has brought me right to you at this present moment, right now."
"This food is filled  with legends and lore, which I summarized along with scientific data and recipe information and all kinds of great stuff in my book ""Naked chocolate,"" which became the sourcebook  or a reference book for people who are interested in raw chocolate, because all the chocolate we've ever had has been processed through high heat and machines."
"And we thought,  maybe we should just eat it cold processed -- is there a difference."
And that's we're gonna explore here as we delve into the astonishing truth about the world's greatest food.
Chocolate comes from the Mayan lands  and ancient Mayan farms.
Chocolate is a Mayan word.
"The word ""cacao"" is one of the oldest words in use in the world today."
"Some people estimate that  that word is 15,000 years old."
The oldest word in the world.
It was brought to the West  and brought to you by Hernando Cortez.
He was the conqueror of Mexico.
"It all happened by an accident, because Montezuma,  who was the leader of Mexico at that time, was in a state of civil war in Mexico City."
"And when Cortez showed up there  in 1521, there was -- they believe that"
Cuauhtémoc himself had come to the great city.
"Christopher Columbus,  when he first spotted cacao he thought it was almond."
And this was money for them.
This is what their currency was.
Today we use coins.
Then they used cacao.
It was their money.
And he saw -- somebody dropped some cacao beans on a little boat.
And they all jumped for it.
Columbus wrote that these people  are crazy about almond.
Montezuma was known to drink  50 cups of chocolate a day.
It was always consumed as a drink.
"And there you see the cup that Montezuma was known to drink out of, or one that's similar to that."
"Anyway, how do you turn this bean,  this nut, into a drink?"
"Well, you'll have to break it open, and eventually get all of those cacao beans into a beverage,  which we'll see later."
"But before we do that, we've gotta look at where  the chocolate comes from."
This is the chocolate tree.
"And yes, money does grow on trees."
"And then he bids for one million, and of course no one bid, any bids for five hundred thousand, four hundred, three hundred.."
Let's start two-fifty.
Someone put their hand up - two-fifty.
"And that's when he started - two-fifty two-fifty, we've got two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, two-seventy-five, anyone two-seventy-five!"
We've got two-seventy-five!!
"Three-hundred, three-hundred, wawawawawawa..!!"
[laughter].
"And even I was a monk, even I started getting excited."
[laughter].
"And you can see just how they do this, just the way they speak, they suddenly raise their voice and started speaking very quickly, and you do get excited."
"And how emotions can be generated, when you see how those emotions can be generated, you can actually sometimes be in power over other people's emotions."
"Just by acting slowly, and by speaking softly you can calm people down."
One of the first times I saw this and it was very impressive was the former abbot and Spiritual Director of the Buddhist Society of Western Australia
Ajahn Jagaro.
I was with him when he was a monk just learning his trade in Thailand.
Because we do learn a trade - this is a training which we go through.
And we were having our morning meal when a Thai lady ran into our dining hall.
"She ran in, and she's obviously very upset, because they don't usually do this - interfering in a monk's meal."
"And she was saying something in Thai, and I actually caught it after a while, she said ""Suchin is dead!"
Suchin is dead!
She shot herself!
"She's committed suicide!""."
"And I got really quite excited too because I knew that lady, she had cancer, we've been going to see her, talking to her, counselling her."
She was a close disciple of the monastery.
"And that morning she had shot herself, and this was her best friend who found her body."
"She came in to the monastery just straight away, completely distraught having found her best friend committed suicide."
You can understand what she felt like.
"And I understood that, and I looked to Ajahn Jagaro who was the head monk at that time to see what he would do."
He understood what she'd said and he put his head down and carried on eating.
And this
"lady - ""She shot herself!"
"She killed herself!"" - and the monk just carried on eating as if nothing had happened."
That's what I was talking about.
To block somebody in a training session on purpose or tease somebody....
I never did that.
"And I think that, because of me, we have nowdays clear rules in this respect..."
That one treats another fair no matter if someone has the fastest or slowest car.
Everyone tries to respect each other and let them their freedoms.
"Things in Formula 1 have changed a lot after 1994, also due to the death of Ayrton Senna."
When you look now at yourself...
What are the special things about Michael Schumacher?
"Considering the beginning of your career where you were considered unapproachable, overambitious, gifted with steady nerves and an intuition about how to act in critical moments..."
There is a good example.
A German sport journalist described it like this:
In order to describe the characteristics of Michael Schumacher there is one key moment!
"It was in Austria 2003, Schumacher is about to win and makes a pit stop."
"While he was standing in the pit, flames are blazing."
"The astonishing thing is that the remains calm, with an even temper."
"Not like that he would jump out of the car, as we might do it... but one recognizes that he moves the helmet slightly to the right and observes in the mirror what is Happening."
"He sees the flames and although everything is over quickly, he drives out of the pit and wins the race."
And I think in this situation you can see what makes the difference between very good racing drivers and champions...
The ability to be mentally ahead in criticial situations.
That they take their time and analyse without any emotion and only after that make their decision without beeing hectic.
Did he describe it correctly?
...
Not bad ...
But I did not say that money is a bad thing
"I respect every religion ... ... as servile, as it is."
Oh. .. yes ... you do not know ...
"Only calm down, stop splashing with your the spinal cord."
MONEY IS GOD
And you believe religion is Christianity Buddhism and shamanism0:
"00:00:23,501 --&amp;gt; 0:00:00:25,001 not ... but certainly not ..."
And you are not stupid ...
13 gallons.
How many people worldwide have no access to any water within a 15 minute
radius of their homes?
One billion people.
And how many gallons of raw or partially treated
sewage flows into U.S. waterways per year?
"Oh, exactly."
Okay.
And final quiz and then
"we'll get on to some more content. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [INDlSTlNCT] &amp;gt;&amp;gt; That's everything, yeah."
"That's the whole management system across the country, yeah."
Final quiz.
"Who said, ""Whisky is for drinking and water is for fighting over, fighting for?"
Any guesses?
Mark Twain said that.
Okay.
Back to you Laura.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"So to start talking about Greywater, there was a really excellent report that came out last year looking at the--can Greywater can really meet our needs and it's a non-potable source of water."
"So if we look at how it can meet our irrigations needs, we can find that it actually matches up really well."
So there's two charts.
If you just look at shower and
"laundry water, these are--have average per capita use in California."
"And then you look at the outdoor use for landscaping, there's a really good match."
"So we can just take all that water instead off sending it to the sewer plant which often, you know, doesn't treat it properly, often it does, but not always."
"We can use that to irrigate outside, things that don't need potable water."
"And another thing to of note is, you know, how much water is this?"
"Like, you know, each household Greywater system like does it really--will it really impact California water?"
And if we look at--this is millions of gallons per day of savings.
"If people take that water and irrigate outside, you can look at just from washing machines, how many millions of gallons you'd save, showers and washers and then all Greywater."
And I wanted to point you to one number that 10% column.
"If just 10% of people--and this is just Southern California--re-use their Greywater to irrigate plants outside, that would off-set the need for a medium sized desalinization plant."
"In Gregorio Marañón or in Castelar, I don't know."
"That moment, when the people were crying and hugging."
"People coming from the northwest and people from the northeast, it was also a moment of..."
"Just over a month had gone by and these people were still getting emotional over little things like that, to meet in a square again coming from different parts of the city."
"They were very emotional moments, and nobody, whether they're for or against what was happening, can deny that there have been moments of emotion. sharing things that don't usually happen in politics."
"They don't usually happen, but that's politics too."
Empathy is pure politics.
Those were three emotional moments that I experienced.
"And the worst, probably what happened in Barcelona."
"I mean what happened at the gates of the Parlament, violence as an answer to whatever, but in the end violent outbreaks of tension."
That somehow fractured part of the message that we were sending out.
That was a very sensitive moment.
But it also consolidated the movement.
"Because people went out to the street to prove that that was just an isolated episode and not what we're about, that is not what defines us."
But it was a complicated episode.
Another bad moment...
ST:
I'd like you to find something that you experienced.
"That you witnessed or that affected you, that made you feel bad."
In my case it's obvious.
There were maybe two.
"The violence on the 5th in the Ministery of Interior, or the 4th of august which was the first contact and not very violent, but for me very surprising."
And afterwards undoubtedly on the 17th I took that video and got home trembling.
I experienced that and it was terrible.
I don't know if you...
JL:
I wasn't there that day.
ST:
"It doesn't have to be in that sense, I don't know."
Frustrating.
"Or if you don't remember, I'm happy for you."
JL:
"For example, on the sculptures, there are 3 crescents, swastika, latin cross, inverted cross or moon and stars of the Turkish flag"
"When retouching or drawing onto them, it gives you the impression of supernatural things."
I'm not trying to give a message or
I don't have a political stance.
"That swastika is standing there actually for ignoring that, it becomes a figure in the picture or a character in the story."
It's the same with the signature.
For me there are 2 types of signature.
Signutare seems like artist's ownership in the work.
I don't believe that signutare is important.
I think the artist is like a screw.
The actual important thing is the artwork itself.
Artwork is like a gun or a toy.
"As I said before, the big signatures that I make, are like symbols and for ignoring this behaviour."
I use the handwritings in the same way
"For example, if there's an empty part in the picture, the handwriting might come right there, I write my name etc."
"If there's not a catchy sentence or word,"
I can simply wirte my name there.
It can be offensive for someone but at them same time it's pretty.
I will do the thing that I want to do with the painting here in this room.
"I will make copies, put them onto the wall, there will be a small video..."
"There's a video that I made, it will be here etc..."
"I collect images from google and make collages with these images,"
I will put them here as well.
These were going to be big sculptures.
"I actually wanted them to be bigger, but still, they are still a reference."
"When we went to see Derya with the paintings,"
she recommended us to show them to Christina and Nesrin.
One night we went to meet them at Galata with paintings.
"They got surprised actually, because normally people do this representation with pdf files or books."
"It was a nice evening though, we liked eachother and we decided to do the exhibition right on that evening."
"I will attend to an exhibition soon, in Koln."
"It's not ready yet, I'm on process"
It's designed for other people too.
We should think about everyone living in our city.
"We need more things designed for everyone."" Babies, children, young people and old people are living in our city."
Some people are physically challenged.
We sometimes care about only ourselves but we should care about those people too.
"As a person living in this city, I want to make everyone happy."
It's important for us to think about things from other people's points of view.
That's the thing I learned in this class.
Let's work together to have a better life in our city.
Hey guys.
Welcome to another episode of Drive Clean.
"I'm Larry from ammonyc.com, where we're obsessed with driving and protecting cars."
"Now, on today's episode, we're going to be working on a 1958"
Porsche Speedster.
"Now, the paint is totally wrecked, so we're going to restore it."
That's all coming up today on this episode of Drive Clean.
[MUSlC PLAYlNG]
"Before we get started, I want to thank all you guys for the emails and comments I received since the first episode."
"They've been spectacular, and I'm really grateful for them."
"But the cool part is I've actually kept track of everything you suggested, and we're going to try to incorporate them into the upcoming episodes."
"So for today, we're going to restore this 1958 Porsche Speedster."
"Now, I think the problem was they washed it improperly, and nobody took care of it, didn't put a cover on it and left outside, so the paint is totally wrecked."
"Now, the first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to clean, protect, or restore the paint."
"Now, obviously, in this condition, it's so bad, we're going to need to restore the paint."
"Now, the second question is what year is the car and has it been repainted?"
"Now, this particular car is a 1958, but it's been repainted in modern times."
"So now I know there's clear coat on it, I can approach it differently."
"Now, the third question is a little bit more complicated."
It's deciding whether the paint is hard or soft.
We're going to talk about how to figure that out in the upcoming steps.
"So this episode is going to be a little bit more complicated, because we're really going to geek out."
No.
"-There you are, you little silly, now it's time to die!"
"-Any last words, you cute little butt-heads?"
"-Yeah, why are you guys acting like Richard Simmons?"
"-Uh, oh no he did not just say that."
"-What the hell, man?"
All Italians are like that.
-[stammers]:
"But, I thought they were like,"
"""It's a spicy meat-a-ball-a."""
-Oh!
I can't listen to this racist little prick anymore.
-Enjoy being racist!
And gay!
-You're gay?
Eww!
"-Well, that was a quick flight."
"Oh, I'd like you guys to meet my new friends from Japan."
[rock and roll music plays]
"-Oh great, let me guess, all Japanese people look and dress like Elvis, right?"
"-Uh, no."
We just got back from an Elvis convention.
-[speaks Japanese]:
-F--king racist!

This video gives a live demonstration of the recursive constructs in sequel that we introduced in the previous video.
"As a reminder, recursion has been introduced intosequal as part of the with statement where we can set up relations that are defined by queries that themselves refer to the relation being defined, and finally we have a query that can involve the recursively defined relations as well as other relations or other tables in the database."
The typical expression within a with statement for a recursively defined relation would be to have a base query that doesn't depend on R and then a recursive query that does depend on R. We gave three examples in the introductory video and those are the same examples that we'll be demonstrated shortly.
The first one was to compute ancestors when we have only a parent relation and the family tree could be arbitrarily deep.
"And Mozilla has been blessed with all three: immense effort, tremendous skill and this luck that things appear."
"So, Mitch appeared and he essentially arm wrestled AOL for that seed money."
We look at the 2 million dollars and we thought that we could support maybe 10 people for two years.
"Because we had set down as mozilla.org and thought that to be effective as a project, the minimum number of people we needed was 10."
Running the machines was one person.
"You know, we keep the project alive but we couldn't be successful."
And Mitch had pitched a little bit of other money and IBM and Sun were our first commercial partners and they pitched in some money and started maybe with 12 or 13 employees.
What that meant was:
"Johnny Stenback and D Baron, that was the platform team."
"One person on Firefox for the front-end team, one person on Thunderbird, one release engineer,"
"Chofmann as an engineering manager,"
"Mick did the ultimate sacrifice and ran our systems for us, for a year or two before we were able to get him back into a role that really fit him better, we had one person helping us on sustainability,"
"Brendan as Brendan, and me trying to be successful."
And that was it.
And that seemed like a lot to us.
[Question]
"That's right, I forgot Asa"
How can I forget Asa?
[Question]
And project management.
And still.
"From that day till now, phenomenal."
"Whenever I have a problem with my browser, Asa is always able to figure out what it is."
So that's it.
No one else can ever do that.
[Question]
"All of a sudden, we had our own independence."
"It was pretty scary, 10 people is not really enough, there was no ongoing financial sustainability that we knew of, it was a gamble, but we had our own independence and we could make a product."
We made phenomenal changes in that period.
It was our second set of phenomenal changes.
"When we were founded we made up an organisation that was revolutionary, as Chofmann described."
How do you work with a company?
"Our life at the resort has finished,"
"We haven't seen the sea, but everything else was wonderful."
Just wait for us to rest from resting
And we'll begin to rest with doubled ardor!
"Go, go, have a rest!"
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers"
"Sea islands, buenavista."
Tou-tou-tourists
"Tourists, for you, tourists,"
Everything is pleasant and useful.
"Tourists, adventurers"
"Sea islands, buenavista."

We're quite content to be the odd browser out.
We don't have a fancy stock abbreviation to go along side our name in the press.
We don't have a profit margin.
We don't have sacred rockstars that we put above others.
"We don't make the same deals, sign the same contracts, or shake the same hands as anyone else."
And all of this is fine by us.
"We are a pack of independently spirited, fiercely unconventional people, who do things a little differently."
While other companies may value the bottom line we value.. well.. values.
"When a competitor considers making something proprietary, we strive to set it free."
"And while most products and technologies are developed behind closed doors, ours are cultivated out in the open for everyone to see."
"We're not beholden to stake, share or powerholders."
We answer to no one but you.
"And we don't operate this way for the fun of it, even though it is incredibly fun."
We operate this way because we believe it is the right thing to do.
We believe in principle over profit.
We'll come back to larger questions of community design on
Thursday.
This is a video about how Vi Hart creates her videos.
He is filming a video about how I actually make my videos but I am filming  a video about How I make a video about how I make a video...
She's famous for being YouTube's most popular Mathemusician and a Khan Academy employee.
"If you haven't seen any of her videos, go to  youtube.com/vihart and watch a few of them."
Vi aims to make videos that show math is cool and  she's doing a great job of achieving her goal.
"For example, ever since seeing her videos about plants and the Fibonacci spirals and Sponge Bob's pineapple when I watch an episode of Sponge Bob or see a pine cone,"
I've become aware of patterns I never seen before...
"Vi Hart has been featured in newspapers including the New York Times, on the YouTube home page several times, and on the YouTube channel ""The VlogBrothers"" from Hank and John Green."
"""Nerd fighters, Click here watch a Vi Hart video  and your whole life will be changed"""
"Well, who am I?"
"Well, I am Ethan Bresnick"
I am a student and short filmmaker.
"Although math is not my thing, making films is and I want to show you how Vi Hart makes her videos."
"Vi starts by writing a script, first."
"If you are interested in how she writes scripts, click on the link in the description below to  view an example of her script writing."
It takes Vi anywhere from a few hours to a  day to write a script for a doodling video
Videos that require research take up to a week or even a month!
"But sometimes it takes a few weeks, as in the  case of her ""What Was Up with Pythagoras?"" video, to make sure that nothing was embarrassingly wrong."
Vi spent several months researching and scripting her plant series of videos.
"For you tech geeks out there, Vi uses Microsoft Word on her work computer and Open Office on her home."
"Next, she shoots her videos."
"""Filming time!"""
Shooting is one of the shortest parts in her process.
"While she usually shoots her videos alone from start to finish, sometimes she offers supporting roles to a few of Khan Academy's interns and employees."
They are eager to help out.
We are just going to do the old switcheroo
You can finish out writing this 100 times.
Keep going!
"It kinda like, you smear it on the back of my hand."
Okay we need more snakes!
*... and sometimes extreme paranoia. *
*The seizures may lock up the joints* *and slightly contort the body. *
"*The pupils will dilate,* *making the eyes appear black. *"
So you believe that Emily had epilepsy... ...which developed into a form of violent psychosis... ...a condition that can be controlled with Gambutrol?
Yes.
"And it would've been, if she'd continued her treatment."
"In your opinion, if Emily had continued with her medication... ...would she be alive today?"
- Absolutely.
"If treated early, psychotic epileptic disorder is rarely fatal."
"I mean, this..."
This was a very sick girl.
The defendant should've realized that Emily was in need... ...of continued medical treatment.
"Thank you, doctor."
Your witness.
"Doctor, you testified that Gambutrol could've controlled Emily's condition."
How do you know that?
It's the inevitable result of taking the drug.
It would've controlled her seizures... ...which were the root cause of her psychosis.
But wasn't Emily still experiencing psychotic symptoms... ...even after she started taking the medication?
Yes.
Because Gambutrol has a cumulative effect.
It takes time to build up in the system.
"You assume that Gambutrol would've helped her, but you don't know."
"It's a reasonable assumption, but..."
"No, of course, I can't be certain."
"Doctor, is ""psychotic epileptic disorder"" a common medical term... ...or did you just make it up?"
"Well, I distinguished and named the..."
So psychotic epileptic disorder is really your own pet theory?
- Objection.
Argumentative.
- Sustained.
When Emily chose to stop her medical treatment... ...what do you think should've been done?
"Elvis was a hero to most, but he never meant  to me."
"Straight up racist, the sucker was simple and plain."
Mother your man John Wayne.
Already I'm hyped cause I'm amped.
Most of my heroes don't appear on no stamp.
"You want to find something that you are engaged with, that you are engaged in, that something that keeps your interest because some of you are going to look back at this time in your life when you were a revolutionary radical and then you grew up and you had kids and stuff."
"I was going to transform the world, now I'm a corporate lawyer with 10 clients, making half a million dollars."
I want to come and visit you then.
"Because life is like that, but the point is you evolve."
You grow.
You deepen.
Let's end the bigotry against young people.
I know some of they sag their pants like they live in sag harbor.
"Maybe if you lift their hope, aspirations, and dreams they're pants will follow."
[Applause]
"Martin Luther King Jr. didn't just change black people, he changed America."
He made white people more human.
He made white civilization more tolerable.
And he brought the humanity of black people to bear.
But he refused to give up on white brothers and sisters and said there is something dignified and beautiful in the consciences of America when we can appeal to those consciences to transform America.
This rather unusual looking car can reach speeds of up to 180 kilometres an hour but that is not what makes it special.
All is revealed when it unfurls it propellors; this car can also fly.
The Personal Air and Land Vehicle or PAL-V is a gyrocopter that can both fly and is allowed on the road.
So what do you need to drive this machine?
"Robert Dingemanse, CEO and founder of Dutch company PAL-V, said:"
"""A normal drivers licence."
And for flying a personal or private pilot's licence and that's something you get in around 20 to 30 hours worth of lessons.
So it's pretty easy in a gyrocopter.
"It's a gyrocopter and that's the easiest way of flying, also the safest way of flying."""
"If the PAL-V sounds like the answer to the traffic jam, there is a hitch."
"It requires 165 metres of runway to take-off, 30 metres to land and can only be flown from an airport."
"It is expected to retail for somewhere between 250,000 and 300,000 euros."
"Kyle, are you here?"
"So, that is my work -to try to bring  a change in the vision of education which is basically about people  getting jobs and doing skills rather than becoming a complete human being."
"Holistic education is about educating  the whole person, the body, mind and the spirit."
"Gandhi said they are an invisible whole, as soon as you try to break off one, you commit a gross fallacy."
And we have committed the gross fallacy in education.
"So, the aims of holistic education,  in my view, are the development of wisdom, and compassion and happiness."
Wisdom and compassion.
"Not intelligence, but wisdom."
That deep understanding of how things are.
"So in holistic education, what is really important, and I think in any education, is the presence of the teacher."
"And so much about teacher's education  and even in service education, is about technique, is about theory, but there is nothing about how  to enhance the presence of the teacher."
"So, how does one enhance  the presence of a teacher?"
"It is simple, it is through practice."
It is through practice.
"So, my practice has been meditation,  and so, in my courses, starting in 1988,"
"I required all my students to meditate for six weeks, every day."
Starting with five to ten minutes  and working up to about half an hour.
"And they kept a journal, they still do  keep a journal, cause I am still teaching."
"And at the end, they write  a one page reflection."
Also I introduce mindfulness activity.
"I have them eat a raisin mindfully and then for the rest of the week, do something mindfully, take some  small thing and do it mindfully."
The final thing is I start my classes  with loving kindness meditation.
"This is in a public university, University of Toronto."
"I think one of the reasons  I came to Canada,"
I do not think I could have done this in US.
"So, since 1988, I have been introducing meditation to over 2000 teachers."
"And to read those journals and  to read that one-page reflection, has just been one  of the greatest joys of my life."
(Half Bell) (Laughter)
So I taught this summer and I have one student that was in my summer class and I am really delighted  to see the students come up to me.
"But I just want to read the journal  of one of the students, just a few words."
"In the meditation,  he was counting one to four."
"So exhale, one..."
- How are we on our medical experts?
- Not good.
The psychiatrist you wanted is tied up in another trial.
And the neurologist is sailing to Costa Rica.
"This book I'm reading, it's by an anthropologist."
"It's about contemporary cases of possession, mostly in the Third World."
People there are still primitive and superstitious.
Maybe.
Maybe they see possession for what it really is.
Maybe we've taught ourselves not to see it.
- You saying you believe in this stuff?
- No.
Maybe we shouldn't just try to invalidate the prosecution's case... ...by punching holes in the medical approach.
Maybe we should also try to validate the alternative.
- Validate possession in a court of law?
- Yes.
Okay.
I guess we could bring in some priests to talk about exorcisms...
"No, the archdiocese won't let us do that."
They wanna limit the Church's exposure to Father Moore.
I've got three articles by the anthropologist who wrote this book.
She approaches the subject of possession... ...from a scientific perspective and doesn't try to debunk it.
- You want me to track her down?
- Yeah.
Keep looking for a medical expert to refute Dr. Briggs.
But send the case file to this Dr. Sadira Adani.
"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...as you know by now, my name is Erin Bruner... ...and I represent the defendant, Richard Moore."
"Mr. Thomas has contended that Emily Rose suffered... ...from a serious medical condition... ...that required medical treatment, nothing more."
"He has asserted that any attempt by my client... ...to help Emily by anything other than medical means... ...was not only inappropriate, but criminally negligent."
I'm now gonna ask that you keep an open mind... ...to what our evidence and testimony will show.
Medical treatment was not the answer for Emily... ...because she simply did not suffer from a medical condition.
She was neither epileptic nor psychotic.
The Zande have dozens of names for illnesses and they also have hundreds of medicinal plants that they use to cure those illnesses.
"But when the treatment doesn't work, if the illness gets worse, they pay less attention to the medicine, and they turn their attention to the witch that is behind the person getting sick in the first place."
"For example, stubbing your toe is not extraordinary."
So if you stub your toe usually gets better after a few days.
"But if it doesn't get better, if it gets infected, if it turns into gangrene, that's witchcraft."
Or lots of people catch the flu.
And you get over the flu in a few days.
"If you don't get over the flu and it gets serious, and you catch pneumonia, that's witchcraft."
"So if the Zande can't control the illness through medicines, they turn to something they can control: social relations."
And I have a couple of stories that I'll show you how that works.
Medicines-- or caught not that one.
Here's a picture of Lucy and her son Benjamin.
Benjamin was just a few weeks old when I arrived.
And he had conjunctivitis in one eye.
And I always carry small bits of medicines with me when I travel.
So I had antibiotics and I treated him every morning; every evening.
I put a drop in his eye.
It got better.
"Lucy wasn't really concerned because it's very common for babies to get conjunctivitis, and it usually clears up, and it did."
But then the conjunctivitis came back in the other eye.
And so now she was getting a little worried.
I then treated the baby every morning; every evening for five days and the eye cleared up.
"So, Lucy was kind of wondering what was happening, but she was okay because it-- then it cleared up."
But then it came back again in the first I.
"And this was really a sign that something was going on, and that there was probably witchcraft involved."
"Now, babies are not usually victims of witchcraft because they really can't offend people."
And he was never really in danger of dying or anything.
"So Lucy interpreted his eye-- is conjunctivitis as a sign that someone was upset with her, and she knew who it was."
So now I want you all to think like a Zande.
Who could possibly be mad at Lucy and her baby?
[inaudible]
Pardon?
"little thing that says, I would say, dude that is totally singular."
Just so you know.
Don't like be messing around doing back slash with that matrix.
Okay.
All right.
That's it for today.
&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;Maile Ohye:
Hi.
I'm Maile Ohye.
I'm a member of Google's webmaster support team.
And I'd
like to help you better understand how to use the URL parameters feature in webmaster tools.
URL parameters is a fairly advanced feature.
So some of this information might be more complex than one would expect.
"Before you further watch this video, please check out the URL parameters page to see if you have a message from Google explaining that we already believe we have high crawl-coverage of your site."
And therefore no adjustments to this feature are necessary.
"The message would say ""Currently Googlebot isn't experiencing problems with coverage of your site."
So you don't need to configure URL parameters.
Incorrectly configuring parameters can result in pages from your site being dropped from our index.
"So we don't recommend you use this tool unless necessary."""
"For those of you who have that message, you're good to go."
And no further viewing is even necessary.
But for those of you who don't have that message please keep watching.
And one of the main takeaways is that improper actions on the URL parameters feature can result in pages no longer appearing in search.
"Again, it's an advanced feature."
The settings in the URL parameters are used by Google as a helpful hint in our crawling process.
"For stronger directives, you want to use things like a robots.txt disallow."
Or a meta noindex.
But using the URL parameters hint is still very helpful.
"In 2010, the Google store only sold about 160 products."
And that seems fine and fairly easy to crawl.
"But the thing is, that of these 160-ish products, it actually created 380,000"
Martin:
"Yes, it's also one of the things we are allowed to tell you people, that you may well start thinking about everything as in movement because everything is basically motion and the more one goes into the movement, the easier life you get it is no more than a few years ago it dawned on me that our beloved Greeks didnt have a word for music"
"What is called ""musica"" is a blend of all the musical expression, so"
"If one started playing, there was of course one that began to dance, another who sang and everyone attended there was no real audience until far into antiquity"
"I think we could learn something from that, and it's also what you say that the movement becomes a part of it"
"I'm sorry to say so but if you want to continue the illusion as a earthling please do, but I would love to help you so if I may, in the other dimensions, you let me know in any case, I think we should all lean at Ole Fogh Kirkeby's wise words"
"A true philosopher, I hope it plants seeds out there in small ponds"
"And so I thank you for your participation, Kirkeby's one of the good guys in philosophy master's in human and Dr. Phil of management philosophy at Copenhagen business school. and director of the ""Centre for Art and management""."
Did I say that the right way?
Ole:
Yes
That is very much in one person
Thank you for joining and send me a letter at:
"Martin@tvfraenandenplanet.dk and if you sit at home and think ""wish it was me who was alien"" then you may very well be"
"Look into my eyes and be inspired, then perhaps we'll meet in a dimention"
Thank's for now
"So that's, you know, coming along."
I'm working with a vocal coach.
Strengthening the...
Lot of guys ignore the laugh and that's about standards.
I mean....
"If you want to get into the evil league of evil, you have to have a memorable laugh."
What?
Did you think Bad Horse didn't work on his weenie?
His terrible death weenie.
No response BTW from the league yet.
But my application is strong this year.
A letter of condamnation from the deputy mayor.
That's gotta have some weight so...
Fingers crossed!
E-mails!
"Too-sly-for-you writes ""hey, genius!"""
They targeted Harry Belafonte.
They targeted Eartha Kitt.
"They targeted anyone who supported the struggle for civil rights, that they considered to be dangerous."
It is in that context we need to look at what happened on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973.
"What they call Joanne Chesimard, what we know as Assata Shakur, she was targeted by the FBl, stopped."
And the allegation that she was a cold-blooded killer is not supported by any of the forensic evidence.
"If we look at the trial, we'll find that she was victimized, she was shot."
She was shot in the back.
The bullet exited and broke the clavicle in her shoulder.
She could not raise a gun.
She could not raise her hand to shoot.
And she was shot while her hands were in the air.
"Now, that is the forensic evidence."
There is not one scintilla of evidence placing a gun in her hand.
No arsenic residue was found on her clothing or on her hands.
"So, the allegation by the state police that she took an officer's gun and shot him, executed him in cold blood, is not only false,  but it is designed to inflame."
JUAN GONZÁLEZ:
"But, Mr. Hinds, before we get into more of the details of the case, this whole issue of 40 years later—"
LENNOX HlNDS:
Yeah.
"UAN GONZÁLEZ: —suddenly branding her a terrorist and also insisting that she is a threat to the United States government at this time, could you talk about the significance of that declaration?"
LH:
"Well, I believe that we have to look at it in the context of what has just happened in Boston."
"I think that with the massacre that occurred there, the FBI and the state police are attempting to inflame the public opinion to characterize her as a terrorist, because the acts that she was convicted of has nothing to do with terrorism."
"The acts that she was convicted of, if you look at the evidence, she was convicted of aiding and abetting, and therefore was present during the shootout."
The FBI and the state police's theory was that Sundiata Acoli shot Officer Foerster.
That was their theory during his trial.
JG:
"One of the people in the car with her, that—"
LH:
"One of the people in the car, yeah."
AG:
"It didn't have a clear designed aesthetic, it didn't have an approach to consumers."
So it was a very powerful product and if you couldn't figure out what was really the best user experience you'd build both and have a pref for it.
"It was known as loaded and overweight and technically good, but a poor product."
That was 2002.
"About a year later,"
AOL decided they were tired of investing in the browser.
"They still had, I don't know, 75 or a 150 people they were paying to work on the browser and they weren't really getting anywhere with it."
"At long last, they became interested in taking mozilla.org assets and giving them to those of us who'd been running the project."
"Again, to give you a sense of what life was like in those days, mozilla.org assets were the trademark, the name, mozilla.org, four big servers we fought for that ran all mozilla.org"
and some seed startup money.
That was really it.
"Yeah, Mick."
[Question]
That's definitely the timing.
"Yes, so that was why it may well have been."
What Mick said was
"""wasn't it the case that the reason AOL stopped investing in browsers and in Gecko is that they just completed a deal with Microsoft where they had agreed to use IE or the Microsoft rendering engine in their browser."""
Is that right?
"Yes, that's right."
"The AOL client, that I forgotten about."
So Microsoft managed to buy AOL out of their own browser effort.
But it was good for us.
"Because that didn't seem like a lot of assets, but it was really critical to us."
"We had thought before about starting our own effort at mozilla.org but without the name, it would have been really hard."
"And four giant servers doesn't seem like much today, but in that era it was a big deal."
"We also got some seed money from them, we got 2 million dollars."
That was a funny story too because
"I had ended up working with Mitch Kapor,"
"I don't know if you know, from Lotus, those who remember Lotus 1-2-3, and Mitch had come to see that open source was really important, after he left Lotus and he had his own open source organisation, and I was working with him."
And he really stepped in to help us.
So Mozilla has a history of things appearing when we need them.
"There is that saying that is it luck, or is it effort, or is it skill."
For example what do Stanford alumni most want to see?
Sat scores.
"Winning state championships and, and national championships."
What is it?
What resources are considered most and
least important?
"On the other hand, does the availability or supply of the resource influence its value?"
Is the resource scarce?
Do only some of the other organizations have it?
How concentrated is the resource?
"Are there, are there alternatives to this resource."
Can another kind of resource be substituted for it.
Who else has it?
Let's consider Stanford again.
What does it offer?
"What, what does Stanford offer that is unique, that no one else can provide?"
It's an open question.
Leave it for the forum.
Discretion over a resource also defines relations of resource dependence.
Discretion is defined in at least two ways.
"First, who controls the resource?"
Can the exchange partner dictate how you use the resource?
Is the resource regulated by the government?
"So changing, districting to increase the resource or, or pool of available students for a particular school."
Is your firm dependent on the supplier for materials and funds?
Or is it dependent on consumers like students and families?
"Second, what controls dependencies?"
What laws are in place?
What are the copyrights or contracts and
licences that exist that prevent us from sharing certain curricula?
"So, for example, in this course I can only afford to use images from the Creative"
Commons.
"This stream cipher consumes in the beginning both a key and IV, as we've seen, but does a computation 100 times to produce an internal state that is then mapped onto the output that's then XORed with the message is basically the output message."
"Interesting is this part, though."
Each of these links is such a small computation that you can easily reverse it.
"It is nonlinear, meaning you cannot really reverse it without 100% certainty, but it's such a small computation that you can just kind of brute force the input space."
[Dave]
Okay. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Carson]
Right?
So little--
[Carson]
But the input space is small.
[Carson]
"Yeah, just a few bits change in each of these steps, so you can just go through all the possibilities of input space and see which ones map back to your output."
Right?
"Now, you may end up with several, so it's not always that only one of the inputs would have produced."
That's exactly the nonlinear property.
"However, this may look as a complication at first but does, in fact, help the hacker because each of these also generates a key for some given IV that you assume."
"Well, at least some."
Some may be dead ends.
But at least in a lot of cases you can track one point that you store in your table back to different keys. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
Different starting key IV pairs lead to the same output.
"Exactly, and on average, for each value that you store in the table you have 13 keys that you find every time."
Only one of them will be the correct one.
Sometimes even all 13 are wrong. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt;[Dave]
I see.
[Carson]
But if you do find a key it will just be one of them.
"However, storing this point in the table is equivalent to storing 13 points in this table."
[Dave]
"Right, and now each lookup is the equivalent of doing 13 lookups."
[Carson]
"No, the lookup is actually the same effort, but the storage is decreased."
"When I was studying in London, I took part in Malaysian and Singapore student organizations, and I dare say a couple of them were pretty radical."
"I thought they wanted to know my activities in London, for which I was mentally prepared."
"However, I began to feel disoriented after their repeated questions."
They kept wanting to know what instructions Tan Wah Piao had given me and what he had told me to do before I left London for home.
I was puzzled to say the least.
I knew not their target was Tan Wah Piow.
I did not know that there were so many people who had been hauled up.
Let me share with you this anecdote.
"I remember in the first few days of detention, our breakfast consisted of a boiled egg, two pieces of bread and a glass of tea with milk."
Almost the same everyday.
It could be the second day when I was one of the first to be served with breakfast.
I was jolted when I saw there were more than a dozen eggs in the bag the Gurkha adjutant was carrying.
I was stunned.
"Prior to this, I knew that one of my friends had also been taken in."
But I never thought there were so many people involved.
One of the detainees asked to see her lawyer.
The cold reply she got was:
"""Your lawyer has also been invited to ""have tea"" with us."""
"It shows how unprepared we were mentally, really!"
"It was strange that when I came to know they were spinning the yarn of a ""Marxist Conspiracy"","
I kind of sighed a heave of relief.
I surmised it must be another of those stories in Arabian Nights.
That same old story!
Why the ISD bigwigs decided to pick Tan Wah Piao as the vortex to get all of us sucked in.
I have yet to find a satisfactory answer!
I told one of the senior officers in ISD that I didn't know many of those arrested.
The answer given was:
"In a conspiracy, you needn't know all of the members involved!"
We may giggle at the reply given.
"But the stark reality is that the 1987 incident did act as a dreadful deterrent to more than a generation of Singaporeans, particularly the youth."
"For over 20 years, people were so wary of politics that they exercised all-round self-censorship."
"Even now, people still recall events in those years with considerable trepidation."
But you still can have a circle of 35.
The circle comes from indigenous people's.
It is a long tradition and this is the most healing way that we can actually be together.
"I am a strong believer  in the circle but also using other variety in things like tribes which is a way to do small groups, and there are kinds of support  mechanisms for that."
Those are just a few little things that I would say.
"-(Man) That last one you said, a tribe?"
"- (J. Miller) Tribes, yes."
Jeanne Gibbs has written a book called 'Tribes'.
Many of our teachers in Ontario  and Toronto are using it.
It is a powerful technique for dealing with large groups and breaking things down.
It gives a guideline to how small groups can work.
Because you can't just put students in small groups and then give them a framework.
(J. Bell) I would like to offer another idea.
Sometimes I've seen teachers  scratch their heads.
What should we do about this issue  when the answers are among students?
"I think if we change our model from thinking we have to control and set it up to saying, ""We are building  a community together."""
"This takes a lot of time up front, setting the rules together, making contracts, agreements for each other, how do we want to treat each other, to talk with each other."
Establish all those things.
"What if somebody doesn't talk like that,  what should happen?"
"We should bring that up, how should  we handle 'the discipline' issues."
"If you create a collective experience, they are getting that sense of ownership, of democratic decision making, a being mindful of how their behavior is part of the mix."
It is much more and you have much less behavior problems if you have 35 students helping  to create the classroom culture.
There are lots of other things.
The use of constant appreciations and shout-outs.
What I noticed Tommy doing well the other day.
"Jose, how did he do well as a leader."
Keep building it a constant thing so they are inoculated with a sense of loving speech and respect and cooperation in the classroom.
It doesn't eliminate every problem  but it goes a long ways.
(Half bell)
(Bell)
(Man in the audience) I am trying to still sort my thoughts as what exactly my question is.
Thank you first of all for the panel.
Question from Diane.
I noticed some attendees at the NASCSP conference asked how they could apply for Promise Neighborhood funds.
Are you seeing more of this happening in the CAA network?
Mark: there are a couple of agencies that are receiving/applying for Promise Neighborhood funds.
I don't know that I've seen a lot of increases in this.
Promise funds are a relatively smaller program right now and it has a very specific focus.
"I have not seen a large number of agencies that are looking at this as a source of funds, but it certainly is similar work to what a lot of agencies are doing."
Brad:
"Bob Scott, are you still with us?"
Bob:
I am.
Brad:
"Bob thanks for being patient through this very long discussion, and as we approach the end, having heard what we said earlier regarding the FY ""13, we hope to hear on the reallocation within a matter of days on FY ""14."
What are your thoughts?
Where do you see the program right now in terms of funding?
Bob:
"Well, I still think that we're at levels below what is really needed to sustain a national weatherization program, and I hope we can make that impression on Congress that $184 million minus a possible $24 million for the multi-family initiative will not keep maintaining this program."
Can we survive 2013 on $68 million plus whatever might be added by DOE?
Perhaps we can.
"I'd like to think we can, but it's only a matter of time before these types of numbers destroy the network."
"We're on very thin ice with it and I hope something can change, and we'll be working to do that."
We need to at least get to those pre-recovery act levels of $225 million.
So I hope we can get by.
"I think most states can hang on for another year, but I think the term, ""we could get starved to death"" is a good way of putting it."
It's certainly something that I fear and hope we can change.
Brad:
Certainly our strategy is to get the funding back to the pre-recovery act levels.
We're talking with
"Senators Reed and Collins right now about an ask in the range of $225 million for FY ""14."
"Elyse was with us Earlier, Senator Reed's Legislative Director, and when she referred to the member request letter, that's where we're having the conversations right now."
And we're looking at the figure right in the range of $225 million.
That's where strategy is.
Which blueprint they follow depends on the weather.
"If their pond remains full... the harmless small heads dominate, feeding on plankton."
"But if the summer rains fail, a shrinking pond means more big heads."
"Armed with curved teeth and strong jaws, the big heads feast on the defenseless plankton eaters."
The big heads become so bloated they can barely swim.
But this is gluttony with a purpose.
"As the drought worsens, the pond shrinks."
And the explosive growth of the cannibals pays off.
Skin toughens.
Gills disappear.
Lungs grow.
The bigheads are air-breathing adults.
The tiger salamander walks into number 7 because it turns cannibalism into a sophisticated insurance policy.
But eating each other is a short term survival solution.
"Some animals can go without food for months, or years, or decades!"
NARRATOR:
The Arctic.
One of the harshest environments on Earth.
"In winter, temperatures plunge to -50 degrees."
One animal sleeps in the storm.
The polar bear.
It survives in the frozen wilderness by saving energy.
"The polar bear looks white, but its skin is black and absorbs heat."
There are two layers of fur-- a soft undercoat; and guard hairs up to 6 inches long.
"The fur, coupled with a thick layer of fat, is such an efficient insulator that a bear loses little heat."
"Look through an infrared thermal imaging camera, and a polar bear is almost invisible, appearing little warmer than the frozen land."
"Wrapped in the ultimate survival suit, males spend their lives exposed to the elements."
Pregnant females use a different strategy.
"At the start of winter, they disappear--underground."
"Outside, a male wanders far in search of food."
"Inside, a female travels through time."
She slows her metabolism and sleeps.
"""I think everyone at some point in their life has felt like they don't belong to something."
"They're not being set apart, they are included in what every other kid they see gets to do."""
"There are more than 80 Sparkle teams all across the country, but those are only in middle school and high school."
"Here at UW Platteville, this is the first Sparkle squad at the collegiate level."
"""It's actually really fulfilling."""
Nate Stikes is a cheerleader and a mentor for one of the Sparkles.
"He's never worked with special needs kids before, and he was nervous at first, but that feeling quickly went away."
"""There's really nothing like it"
"I just see in their eyes that this is the most fun that they've had and they love every minute of it, and that's what makes doing it worth it, is seeing the smiles on their faces."""
"""Kids with disabilities are just like everybody else, and don't be afraid of them."""
Mitch says the program has had a profound impact on her life as well.
"""The first couple practices I'll admit I left and I was just so overwhelmed, I was in tears, and now I leave and I'm just smiling."
"The joy and excitement and the pleasure they get out of this, and their parents..."
"I still tear up a little bit because it's amazing."""
This team is special because each and every member makes it sparkle.
"""To know them and meet them is to love them."
"And you meet these kids for ten minutes, you're going to fall in love with every one of them."""
Stéphane (ST):
"Juanlu, thank you for coming"
First I'd like to ask you to give a brief presentation; who you are and what you do.
Juanlu (JL):
"My name is Juan Luis Sánchez, I'm a journalist and I'm one of the people who started periodismohumano.com"
"And, well, we were in the Puerta del Sol from beginning to end"
And we try to follow what has been happening around the 15-M phenomena before it was called that.
ST:
"Yes, afterwards we will ask you in detail about the coverage you gave to that."
"The first question is ""THE question""."
"I'd like you to tell us, from your point of view, what is the 15-M movement?"
JL:
"I think the 15-M was, for many weeks, a physical space where people could share ideas, that came from a non-physical space, a virtual space, from the net, from indignation."
"And all that soon spilled out from internet onto the street, and people started talking about politics, and that it should be OK to talk about politics, and come up with a common diagnosis to society's problems."
"Global problems, not just local."
Spent the whole day running around the museum.
It was awesome.
I had a wonderful time.
- I went to the Secular Student Alliance Leadership Conference in Columbus where I helped poison the minds of the current and future leaders of the secular movement.
- Good for you.
- All in a day's work.
- Okay.
The devil must be very happy.
- Yes!
"- Today I have yet another installment of my Failures of Chritianity series, and I've"
"- Which we could do forever, by the way."
- That's right.
So we're just scratching the surface.
I'm up to number 8 today.
"The idea here is there's so many failures, how could there possibly be a god behind all this?"
Or maybe there is.
I don't know.
"Previously, I've talked about the failure of christian based abortion policy, the christian genocide of the Jews, the failure of the catholic pedophilia scandal, the failure of prayer, the failure of the 2nd coming, the failure of social engineering, failure of biblical morality, and today I'm going to talk about the failure of"
'christian science'.
Got to put that in quotes.
So what is chrisitan science versus real science?
"Well, christians supposedly worship the creator of the universe, the creator of the earth that created all human beings, all animals, and supposedly the bible is divinely inspired and sort of written by the hand of god indirectly."
"And, supposedly, he talks to christians through prayer, and supposedly he knows everything."
He's omniscient.
"So you would think that there'd be all sorts of interesting facts about the way the world works in the bible and believers would know all these things, and there'd be all sorts of special insights there."
But that's just not the case.
"What qualifies as science in the bible would fit on about 4 pages, comments about he nature of reality."
And what is there is almost complely wrong.
It's pretty abysmal.
"So, christians like to use this word 'science' and grab on the coattails of science and use the word 'creation science' and try to make it science-y and make it all better."
And it's really just marketing.
"So, often there's sort of an attempt to steal the work of other people or steal the credit."
"So, conversation mode will be available on Google Translate in a few months."
We just wanted to give you a sneak preview.
I have just one more demo to show you before I go.
This is actually launching this week.
"It's the new Street View Ul, which will launch as part of an update to Google Maps for Android."
"And to show you that demonstration,"
"I'd like to take a quick trip to Florence in Italy, so I'm going to click on the bookmark here on my desktop."
"So here we are in Florence, Firenze."
I'm going to zoom in a few times and move around.
"Now, to activate the Street View feature, I can click on the business so I can just hold in place anywhere on the map, so which is exactly what I'm going to do here."
Let me try a different--slightly a different place.
So here we are.
"So, I can click on this little guy here, we call him Pegman and he will just launch the UI for me."
"So what you see here is a beautiful, you know, three-dimensional panorama on Street"
"View and there's a little guy here which we just launched, and if I drag Pegman around, you'll see this little circle, we call it the pancake; and the pancake actually knows the three-dimensional structure of the scene pretty well, so you can see that it understands that there are building and facades; and I can just drag it where I want to go, just"
"like I do on the desktop, and it will just take me there."
"Pretty cool, right?"
So it looks
"like there's something interesting here down the street, so let's keep going a little bit."
Let me just try this again.
Sorry about that.
So let's take an even bigger leap here.
So
I just keep going down the street and there's a beautiful building down there which I would
love to take a closer look.
"Now, here, I just want to show off this again."
Look how amazingly well is the understanding of the 3D scene here that we have with Street View.
"So I can actually get very close to that building down there, that's the Santa Croce Cathedral here in Firenze or over in Firenze."
"Again, I can zoom at it more closely."
"So if I want to take a look at the very specific details of the facade, I can see them in high resolution."
"This is beautiful, almost as if I were right there."
So these are the demos that I wanted to share with you.
(Laughter)
"So, anyway, we started and  because I have the disability,"
"I asked a colleague to teach with me because there are days I just can't walk and there are days that  my voice is not so good, so I always worked with a colleague."
So we started off about 8 years ago.
We had no money and what we had to do  is we have to make sure that we have enough students  to be able to pay the teachers.
"So, that is one of the most important lessons for you to think about."
We keep waiting for money and  permission to do this work.
And you don't have to do that.
You just have to step into it and  you have to find a way to integrate it.
"So whether you do luncheon learns for the teachers, whether you do it after school program, whether you integrate it into the teachers' morning coffee, however you are going to do it."
There are so many different ways  to be able to start to integrate mindfulness  and mindfulness meditation.
"Jack is right; that  if you teach the teachers, it will be contagious and  it will go right through the classroom."
"So, now I teach at University of Toronto,  and I also teach APEC master."
"So, two universities  for the mindfulness program."
That's remarkable.
And why are they asking?
"Because they realize that in health care in particular, not in education that is our issue, my program is addressing the professionalism which includes education but largely is a lot  of health care professionals."
We are suffering.
"I would say that right across the board, the society is suffering."
I think the world is suffering.
And we have forgotten how it is  that we are to attend this suffering.
So this is my goal and I have 60 workshops at University of Toronto and  there are 40 faculties.
Many of them who are here today.
"Okay, go ahead, hit the gong."
(Laughter)
That is another thing  mindfulness can do for you.
It just allows you just a larger vision because you perceptual feel changes.
(Laughter)
So I want to say to you that this is easy.
You can't be stuck in your demoralization  and we are all feeling demoralized.
"When you start to think back  to the early work of Thay around the Vietnamese war or Martin Luther King we worked with, you can imagine their demoralization  around seeing so many people injured."
We have gone the longest  of any civilization without war.
So that was 2001 when I was fired.
[Question]
Yes.
The question was:
"""The open web is here today it's easy to see why it's important back then in those days before the open web, how did you know?"
"What makes you willing to risk your job?"""
"We'd been working on a browser for a while, so we could tell that the browser was important."
"It was clear at that time, when Microsoft had maybe 90-95% market share in the browser, in the operating system and in the productivity suites,"
"Office and Excel, which were the only things that people used in those days."
"And so it was clear that in those days,"
Microsoft controlled access to the Internet.
We didn't call it the open web then but it was the Internet and we knew it was great.
"It was very clear that by controlling the browser,"
Microsoft controlled how individual people experienced the Internet.
"That the server side of the Internet in those days was developing, growing and becoming richer and more capable."
"But the client side was deteriorating and through that client,"
Microsoft was able to ignore formats to make vast quantities of content unavailable to people.
And to determine the business model through which you could access content and to have an immense influence over the entire structure of the Internet.
So that much was clear.
It sounds melodramatic but the future of the Internet was already an issue at that point.
It was very clear the browser was the leverage point.
We were very clear about our jobs.
"One second, I'm gonna tell a couple of stories and then I'll get you Chris."
But we were very clear that our jobs were on the line.
It wasn't just me.
It was everyone I named and Marcia.
Is Marcia here?
I didn't see her hand go up.
But we would have meanings as the small group that was mozilla.org when the tensions got really high and we would get together and we would say things like
"""What happens if AOL pulls the plug?"
What happens if we're all fired tomorrow?
"How do we keep Mozilla operating?"""
Dr:
Yes.
S:
Fascinating.
"The people who are dying of heart disease, is it the cholesterol that's killing them or the inflammation?"
Dr:
I think it's a chicken-and-the-egg phenomenon where the inflammation allows the cholesterol to deposit; and they go together.
S:
"It's really the statins affect inflammation, which then reduces cancer by stopping the inflammation."
Dr:
Exactly.
One of the problems we have in Biology and Medicine is what you can measure.
"So, I can measure cholesterol."
I don't really know how to measure inflammation well.
"So while we can make these associations in big studies where we look back, if I had a metric, a blood test or something to look at for inflammation, I could optimize this."
S:
Can you not just measure the amount of cytokines or other inflammatory types of things?
Dr:
There are different types of inflammation.
"So, some inflammation can be good, some can be bad."
"Some can be really causal, some can be a little causal."
"So we're putting them all into one basket now, which is inflammation, the key is to start to tease them out, and be able to modulate them."
"You can develop a drug, but then you would have to optimize it for a particular purpose."
"So, these were optimized to lower cholesterol."
They do that very well.
"It also lowers inflammation, and they work beautifully in that regard."
But how do we optimize that going forward?
"It also means that when you look at your lifestyle and my lifestyle, we have to limit inflammation."
"So, what are the easy ways to do that?"
"One is, which I think should be mandatory, is things like the flu shot."
"So again, the flu shot will certainly delay you from having or prevent you from having a bad flu..."
S:
I'm sure there is something else she's into
"No, there is nothing else"
"Ohh, there's toothpaste on this shirt."
"Someone needs to invent invisible toothpaste, please."
I see your little tongue.
Why don't you show everyone?
Look at that little tongue.
Yes.
Today's video's gonna be a little bit angry.
Little bit.
It's gonna be sort of a rant.
"So if you don't have time for that, then there's plenty of other things on the Internet for you to consume yourself with, so just go ahead and click off."
"So I don't think I've ever done this on my channel before, where I address, like, one thing that someone's said or written,"
"But I'm gonna do that today, because it's relevant and also because I think I can help people."
"What I want to talk about has to do with this fucking, absolute dickhead who wrote maybe one of the dumbest things I've ever read."
And his name is [fumbling pronunciation]
"Yuksel Aytug — I don't know how to fucking say that — wrote an article about how the Olympic Games are, quote, ""killing womanhood."""
Let me just read to you some of this article.
And I'm gonna link it below so you can go look at it.
"He's Turkish, I think the original article is written in Turkish, so this is a translation, but you'll get the gist of it."
"Basically what he's saying is that their bodies don't look like women, and to ""take a look at female swimmers."""
"""Broad-shouldered, flat-chested women with small hips."""
"They're ""totally indistinguishable from men."""
"""Their breasts — the symbol of womanhood, motherhood — flattened into stubs as they were seen as mere hindrances to speed."""
"He said the Olympics force women to ""look more like men,"" and ""the manlier you look the more successful you are."""
"Then he said that you should get bonus points according to how ""feminine"" you looked."
"""Otherwise we will destroy the grace and naïveté of women through the Olympics."""
"First of all, since we're objectifying people as tits and ass,"
"I'm gonna show you a picture of Ayteg [mispronounced], fucking whatever his name is."
"We're gonna call you ""Ponytail"" from now on."
"Now, I don't think that most people would agree with Ponytail."
"And, in fact, a lot of the Internet was angry, so I'm not going to try and slam him, for obvious reasons."
Telemachus basically undoes any doubt that we had about whether he's grown up.
"Remember at the very beginning of the, of the epic, Athena comes up to Telemachus and says basically, just come on, grow up."
"It's time for you to get going, take responsibility."
"On book eighteen he says, I used to think as a child, but not anymore."
"My heart takes note of everything, feels it too, both the good and the bad."
The boy you knew is gone.
So Telemachus is now stepping into a different stage of life.
"And he is ready to take on responsibility for, not just his own messes, but other people's messes."
"That's probably a pretty strong part of what it is to grow up, is taking on other people's messes."
"Who knows, maybe there should be a universal law built into this one."
To grow up means to take on other people's messes.
"But Telemachus is stepping up to do that and ready to, ready to do it."
Others seem to notice that this is going on.
"At the close of eighteen, he makes threats on page 389 that the suitors take seriously."
People are recognizing that he's talking more stringently.
"Page 419, we see another example of this."
"The suitors bite their lips, amazed at Telemachus stepping up and getting his, getting his more grown up person to take responsibility for what's happening around him."
Then we also see some close-up with what the suitors are all about.
We see this through Odysseus's eyes.
"We've heard from them, we've seen the misery and threats to Telemachus."
We've seen Penelope have some very small interactions with them.
But we really get to see them at work.
"See them, see the suitors being the suitors through Odysseus' eyes."
"And this starts opening up to us in this section of the, of the text through book seventeen and eighteen."
Odysseus makes his way in and makes contact and we get to see what they're
like.
"So these suitors, who are eating Odysseus out of house and home and helping themself to whatever they feel like that belongs to someone else."
"When a beggar comes in and ask them for their scraps, they turn him away similarly."
The suitor's not only abused the xenia that they expect is going to be offered them as sort of guests who horribly overstay their welcome in Odysseus' house.
"But, they've not only pervert that xenia but they also refuse to offer the xenia they should offer to the stranger that washes up into their, into their region in this courtyard of Odysseus' house."
They treated him with abuse.
They don't give him any food.
"A load of pople, and suddenly a sofa flying over everybody."
A sofa appeared through the street and they carried it into the square.
JL:
(laughs) Yes!
There have been precious moments that I didn't experience but they've told me about them.
"Like the first morning they ate rice with prawns, because the neighbours' were so supportive, or people who came from far away, brought a pot, and although they couldn't stay, they left it there so others could eat."
"And I remember the first or second night, they brought nine pizzas that someone had ordered for us from Galicia."
Someone in Galicia called a pizzeria close to Sol and put 9 pizzas on their credit card and asked them to be delivered to the kids that were there.
"That doesn't happen in real life, or maybe it does and we don't see it, that there are people that generous."
ST:
"I remember, maybe on the 17th, the second or third day, people from a restaurant came with beans and rice pudding."
"And I was so happy, for a few moments..."
JL:
"That was the Asturian, he also took cider."
He also took some of his own cider.
"I don't know if it's the same asturian, but a co-worker of mine interviewed that gentleman."
And he took his lorry.
"He took a lorry full of soft drinks of a particular brand, maybe we'll find out if it was the brand or the bar that sent them."
But there were very beautiful moments of true solidarity and communal generosity.
But that's not what it's all about.
Although it allowed the atmosphere to be very pacific.
"And the atmosphere swallowed up the very few who maybe would have liked to cause problems, because that was their way of fighting the system."
But that's not the debate
I want to go into.
"What I mean is that soon those people who usually do that kind of thing, they didn't because they were swallowed up by the multitude which said: ""we don't do that kind of thing here, we've decided that's not how we want to protest for now""."
That's an important force.
"And then the third moment of emotion was during the confluence of the ""northwest march"" and the ""northeast march"" on the 19th of July which was the first authentically hetergeneous demostration."
They came from different neighbourhoods and cities.
The moment they joined together at a roundabout on the Castellana.
Patricia:
Gregorio Marañón [in the background]
JL:
I know the labor HHS subcommittee's due the 26th.
I think most have planned it on that day.
Brad:
"Let's talk for just a minute about what that involves, because we've just been engaging with our community, many of whom are on the webinar today."
What's the strategy for the member request?
Are you seeking to be going out with Senator Collins on a broad-based letter?
Hopefully we can get 34 Senators or more.
Elyse:
Yes.
That's the hope and plan.
We are currently working with Senator Collins on finalizing a letter which we hope to get done in the next couple of days so that we can start circulating.
"The process is compressed this year because we only just finished up the FY ""13 process a few weeks ago and passing that continuing resolution for the rest of the year."
So now we're in this turn around.
We thought we would have a bit more time on these letters.
Chairwoman Mikulski really wants to get the process started.
The House is moving on a much faster clip with their member request deadline.
We're in this period where we're going to try to get this letter out in the next couple of days and share it with you so you can share it with your membership.
"And hopefully we will have the same kind of broad-based push for this letter as we did for the FY ""13 letter."
"Those kinds of efforts among the state directors and the people on the field to go out and call members of Congress, in this case the Senate, to say, ""This is an important issue, and I really would like you to sign this letter""."
That helps us get the signatures.
"The more signatures we have, the more signatures we can show, the better off we are in terms of trying to get a better number on the Senate Appropriations bill."
Last year the number was higher and we want to see the same this year.
Brad:
Absolutely.
Thanks to Senator Reed's efforts and Senator Collins for working together to get that number up to $145 million last year.
"But, very well said on the importance of the stake holder direct communication with the members."
Arley and I are on the Hill virtually every day.
"They see us, they know us, but when they hear from their own states and districts it makes such a huge, huge difference."
Elyse:
It's that human's touch.
That on the ground level knowing a constituent is calling.
You need both.
"But, I were working on a portrait, someone's face, then I'd probably would lower the Detail slider and increase the Masking slider because I don't want every little detail in a subject's skin to be exaggerated by sharpening."
Now I wanna mention that these sharpening controls affect the entire image but if you wanna apply more or less sharpening to a specific area you can do that using one of the two local tools which I'll cover in the next chapter; the adjustment brush and the graduated filter.
And I'll also mention that sometimes you can apply a sharpening preset and that will do all the work for you.
Lightroom does shift with the number of presets.
Those are located over here in the left column in the Presets Panel which I'll open by clicking this triangle.
The presets in Lightroom 4 are inside of
Subject Matter folders.
These are User Presets and in the User Presets there is a folder of Lightroom General Presets.
"And here, I have two Sharpening presets that come with the program."
A Sharpening preset for faces and another for scenes like this one and you can certainly try those out at least as the starting place and then you can tweak the sliders to taste.
Were you fooled?
It's not that tricky.
The answer is still the same.
"Energy is an amazing quantity, but before we can start making calculations using it, we're going to need to learn about something called potential energy."
"-What's happenin', forum?"
"So imagine that you're in your bedroom, getting undressed and you're butt-ass naked."
But then you look out your window and you see this pervert.
Buhh...
"Now, I don't know this perverted cat's name, so we'll just call him Quagmire."
"Now, Quagmire's video got, like, a half million views and I don't know why."
"I mean, look at him."
Just creepin'.
Waiting for you to leave the room so he can sneak in and sniff your underwear.
"And what's with cats, you know?"
"I mean, a dog might rape your leg, but he isn't gonna cut off your penis and wear it like a mask"
like this freakin' stalker.
Buhh...excuse me while I go take a shower.
"Okay, I actually didn't want to review the next video, but like literally billions of you sent it to me."
"Literally, billions... or hundreds, but you know, who's counting?"
So this awful video got like a million-and-a-half views in a day after it was promoted on FailBlog.
And you know what?
Just here...enjoy.
"Not turn the mindfulness  into another ought, because we can do that  if we are not careful."
"I guess I'll advice you to get support and to say that of course there is a great deal of it about, really."
There is a lot of mindfulness happening  in many ways and under many titles.
"So let's not get obsessed with any  particular approach, sect or language."
Let's reach out to people in social emotional learning.
"There are many mindfulness programs happening at the moment, very good curriculum being already developed."
"If you want to know what is around,  go on the Garrison website."
There are 37 programs to draw and  lots of fascinating stuffs around.
"I think we should really see science as an ally, not the enemy and I am sure I am preaching to the converted here."
But I think things like randomized control trials can be our friend not our enemy.
"I said that to someone  who is just being part of a group who published the randomised control trial or the .b program, and found very effective changes in terms of stress and anxiety and so on."
"Neuroscience is our friend, not our enemy."
We don't want too much 'do-wellism' here.
We don't want to start thinking  nice people teach mindfulness and nasty people teach physics and math.
(Laughter)
(Bell)
It is the same in classrooms.
"I am going to take 2 minutes  to say a couple of things, if I may."
"The final thing I'd like  to say really is to make sure that we bring mindfulness to people, not to expect people to come to it."
"And to be aware that for some people, the kind of stuff we do is very off-putting and very weird and very odd."
"We need to stop where they are, not where we'd like them to be."
"If we want to talk to teens,  for example, it may be 'singing songs about flowers' is not going down well with some tough teenagers."
(Laughter)
"Mad, dare I say."
Don't we get any more minutes  for laughter time?
No?
Okay.
(Laughter)
"Just to make sure that we express things in ways, in the language and imagery and use things like films and pop music and so on to really appeal to teens."
"Similarly, if we are talking to  administrators, let's talk where they are."
"Let's talk the language of stress  and number of days saved if people learn mindfulness, not to expect them to get into the spiritual side."
"They will get there, it is a path, we can start anywhere, as these people said."
We also made an initial experience for people they could relate to.
That's our Start page.
Before...
[Question]
Do you want to?
"You don't have mics, and there's no mic for that."
How about... you (...)
So I'm gonna step back.
How did Firefox come into being?
"Firefox had started in a few years before, in 2001 maybe, where it became clear that the old products had a bunch of problems."
"Not only was it really built for developers and much too powerful, not too powerful but not elegant and not beautiful on how it displayed its power."
"And it was a combined browser, email client, IRC client, app launcher environment."
"This was a cause of intense fighting and so a small group of engineers went off and had an idea for doing something more elegant, just a browser, that was focussed on a product a family would want to use."
So there were five or six of them.
[Question]
Yeah.
So Dan says a couple of those guys were at Netscape working on the suite as their day job and during their spare time some were community members and some were not engineers like Asa was involved
"So that had been bubbling a lot for a while, and so on."
It wasn't anywhere near done and it was both a source of a relief and some contention for the engineers working on it.
Was there more you wanted to say?
Ok.
"So it had been bubbling a lot and existed in a source code repository,"
I think when we formed the foundation it was 0.2 or maybe 0.3.
That's probably a good time to tell the story of the name of Firefox.
"So when it was first started, the engineers thought"
"""wow we're building a new browser out of the ashes of Mozilla 1.0"" and so it was named Phoenix."
[Question]
For a really non-product but Mozilla/Browser when it came to have a name it was Phoenix.
"Well, there is a company, Phoenix Technologies, it's a BlOS company, it's been around forever, they once had a browser kind of thing and so the World of Trademarks contacted us and said we couldn't use the name Phoenix and we looked at it and they were probably right, they had a product that was pretty close."
"So of course, from Phoenix, the next obvious name is Firebird."
"So our browser was Firebird for one or two releases and it turns out there was, and still is, an open source database project by the name of Firebird."
[Question]
(Bell)
"(R. Brady) Thank you John, thank you all."
Thank you all.
We now have about 25 minutes  for questions and answers.
"Please, there are some microphones in the center aisle."
"Please make your question brief, the answers also may also be brief."
Please ask your question  of the whole group and whoever feels led to respond would do so.
"It maybe that no one feels ready to respond and your question needs just to sit with you, which is a wonderful form  of contemplation."
Rilke talks about it in a very famous  quotation about living the questions.
"We all have questions that will take years for us to get answers to, so we might not get them today."
Let's begin with the first question.
"(Man in the audience) Hello,"
I grew up and started practicing as a child in a discipline which is quite different  than anything you do.
And actually I became a teacher  of this tradition.
That tradition was alloted to and added to science.
"Science as a tradition, as a discipline, has become the dominant one  in our culture today."
"Now, one of the interesting things is that over the time that I was teaching,"
I was trying to teach the students one thing.
That is to understand reality.
"And I find that the Buddhist tradition is essentially trying to allow you  to do the same thing, to see reality clearly  and to understand it."
"I wonder whether you teach the students using the Four Noble Truths, etc, to do that."
"(M. Chaban) The new science is going to be something that doesn't divide subject and object, is not reductive and all the paradigms  that went with scientific materialism have been proven inaccurate."
"We have lived for 500 years with one world view and we are at the tipping point of what Michel Foucault, a French  philosopher would say is a new episteme."
If you look at and this is more... because I am sure you understand this if you are asking the question.
"But if you look at Dan Siegel's work,  he has done a breathless presentation  on what the new sciences will be."
It would include the subject 'the voice'.
"So, part of what we did today  is we talked about ourselves."
That wouldn't be allowed a few years ago in any kind of scientific presentation.
"Secondly of all,  we are polished scholarships."
"Some of us are Buddhists,  some of us are not."
"Yet, we deep into different traditions and use them because they counter and form each other in a positive way."
His Holiness said that Buddhism  is very scientific.
"We used to have this beautiful, little bird: the mountain plover; also gone."
"This is sobering information, so what can we do?"
We can choose a better future.
"Let's apply the empathy that we have for our cats, dogs, and other pets to endangered species like this chimpanzee, but all endangered species."
Let's have fewer children; that's one of the most powerful-- (Applause)
- Thank you! - (Applause)
- I didn't expect that response. -
"That's one of the most powerful things that we can do in the United States; if we want to have kids, great; let's have two."
"If want to have more than two kids, let's adopt."
What else can we do?
"Well, we won't go there."
"So, what else can we do?"
We can help educate girls and provide economic opportunity to women in developing countries.
(Applause)
Amen!
"When we do that, those ladies choose to have to have smaller families, and we have more nutrition, more health care, more education for their kids, and the impact on the global population is huge."
"Finally, what we can do is we can give more to our planet."
"We can give half of our donations, let's say, to people and people-related causes, and half of our donations to the planet, to ocean conservation, to wildlife conservation."
"I want to mention, by the way, that today, we only give about 2 to 5% of all giving that goes to environment and wildlife as a category."
"You've been very patient with sometimes, a difficult topic;"
"I just want to say that the thing to think about is do we change, as a species, what do we do, so that our fellow living beings who happen not to be human can thrive alongside of us a 100, 500, and 1,000 years from now."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
"-- Hi, Jonathan!"
"Can you tell us who you are, please?"
"-- So I am the CTO at Normation, a company I founded in Paris, France, back in 2009."
I've basically a sysadmin background.
I've been using CFEngine since 2009 when the version 3 came out.
-- And can you tell us what is the role of Normation in CFEngine?
-- Normation is specialized in configuration management automation in general. we've actually been leading CFEngine training sessions across the world since 2011.
I think that to this state we've trained more than 150 people in CFEngine
I think the first session was in Paris for obvious reasons -- because we're based there.
- Have you seen it?
Just asking.
- Why did you ask?
- What?
Wait here.
I'll be back.
"- OK, just go."
How's the giant ghost bat?
Giant ghost bat my ass.
"Che, it's a pity you don't get to see a giant ghost bat."
I'm scared.
I'm scared?
Shit.
"Getting a sense for the way space time works in special relativity is very challenging and one of the ways that traditionally we Become accustomed to this and help wrap our minds around the weirdness, is to challenge ourselves with paradoxes."
"Almost invariably, they end up having to do with simultaneity because it's the relativity of what right now means that is really so current to everything that we are used to seeing."
"So, in this optional clip, I'm going to take advantage of my time and go through two of the most famous paradoxes in special relativity and discuss them in some detail and hopefully that will help clear things up and I suspect spur a lot of forum discussion because I'm not going to manage to clear everything up here."
"So let's start with a, a ladder paradox."
Ladder paradox is if you want urban parking problem.
The idea is you have a long
ladder of length L and the short garage of length G but G is less than L and you want to fit the long ladder into the short garage.
And the idea is very simple.
You come running with a ladder at the garage at a very high speed.
"Then, therefore the"
long ladder is going to be Lorentz contracted to the point if v is high enough where it is shorter than g.
"Notice that by making v close enough to c, I can make the Lorentz contracted ladder as short as I want."
"And voila, the ladder fix in the garage."
The ladder is fixed in the garage but note it only fixed in the garage while its moving very rapidly to the right.
"An obvious puzzle occurs because this may be true but relativity says I can look well, view the same situation from the point of view of somebody sitting on top of the ladder."
"And from the point of view of the ladder, the ladder is at rest, that's an inertial frame, the ladder is moving with a constant velocity to the right v. in the"
"ladder frame the ladder itself is stationary, while the garage is moving at exactly the same speed v but to the left approaching the ladder."
But from the
"ladder point of view, the ladder's length is L, its at rest."
Hand out of the frame!
What is this fractal snake doing here?
"Vi uses speed ramps and transitions, effects available in Adobe Premiere to produce a fluid switch between her hands and the intern's hands."
"My video includes snippets of Vi's video and  her video includes snippets of my video so our two videos are intertwined, like Escher's Drawing Hands"
"When I began watching Vi's videos, I wanted to know where Vi sets her camera and desk when shooting her doodling videos."
Alright!
So I got my tripod with my camera.
Looking at my notebook.
And I guess usually you don't know what else is on my desk.
In this case...Well there is always going to be sharpies everywhere on all sides... and possibly some snakes...
I have this pen holder for holding my sharpies...but  very quickly they end up screwing around.
My script is here for reference.
I have some lights clipped  to random things...That I may or may not use.
Sometimes I like to spin around in my chair when I am waiting
I do a lot of chair spinning...
Many of you may be wondering whether she storyboards her doodling?
No!
She just draws whatever fits her script.
"After shooting, she does a voiceover, typically at home  because it is quieter than her office."
She uses a Blue Microphone to capture the best possible sound.
"She records straight into Audacity, a free audio editor and recorder."
As you'll learn later on in this video the vlogbrothers appreciated vi's videos and as a present gave  her a mic and a higher resolution camera than the one she had been using before.
"If you look closely at my video, you can see  Vi is shooting on a Canon VlXIA HF M40."
Next Vi edits her video.
She uses Adobe Premiere on her Toshiba laptop.
She speeds up videos so you can see in just  a few minutes what takes hours to shoot.
Then she syncs it to her voiceover so that her  narration correlates to the images in the video.
Next she uploads her new creation to YouTube.
"Vi has a ""cool"" interface on YouTube because she is a partner."
"Following up on the theme of this video, recursion, Vi  and I point our cameras at each other."
"On the basis of viewers"" and fans"" comments and questions, Vi  and I decided to do a short interview."
"If you have questions about Vi's videos that aren't answered in my video, please let me know by writing a comment  below and I will answer them on a live chat, see the description below for the date and time."
"I've always wanted to be able to teach everybody, every single person and that's not been easy and I don't think I can teach everybody."
"But this experiment, hopefully which becomes an ongoing activity in my"
"life, I feel like this gives me the ability to reach out to you on a one to one basis and hopefully."
"Make you learn, and be excited."
Finally.
I love change and uncertainty.
Because life would be pretty boring if I knew exactly what was going to happen when.
I know sometimes in life you want certainty.
But I'm talking about most of life.
Uncertainty is what gives you value in life.
So remember we are experimenting here.
I want you to come with that attitude.
I'm going to learn
"Finance in a new way, and I'm going to go with it."
There'll be glitches.
There'll be errors made along the way from your side.
"Maybe from technology, maybe from some errors in the assignments or so and so forth."
I'm almost sure we'll try our best not for that to happen.
"But if something happens, remember, you are a pioneer, I am a pioneer, and we are working on it together."
I'm looking forward to seeing you in a week.
And may the force be with you.
See you soon.
Bye.
"Often times we think about the dangers of vehicles on the highways, but we rarely think about how dangerous they can be when we're parked in a driveway."
"You know, probably more children die every year than we'll ever imagine from being backed over, from a caring, loving, parent, or a visitor, who never intended to cause harm to that child."
"You know, with children playing, they're not paying attention to what the adults are doing, or the drivers are doing."
"And even from inside the vehicle, they could even check both mirrors,"
"left / right, rear-view mirror, and think that they really are clear, and that they can't see anybody."
"But you'd be surprised how a child can somehow maneuver their way into the back of a vehicle, into a blindspot, and you may never even know they're there, until it's too late."
"Then the driver puts the car into reverse, backs out, and that's all it takes."
"It's going to be important for a person to know where the children are at, at all times."
"Maybe even to say, everybody could you move into the yard, or could you move onto the porch until we back away, and are out of the driveway altogether."
I'll give you a couple of examples.
"Schools are still pretty much organized on factory lines - ringing bells, separate facilities, specialized into separate subjects."
We still educate children by batches.
"You know, we put them through the system by age group."
Why do we do that?
"You know, why is there this assumption that the most important thing kids have in common is how old they are?"
"You know, it's like the most important thing about them is their date of manufacture"
"Well, I know kids who are much better than other kids at the same age in different disciplines, you know, or at different times of the day, or better in smaller groups then in large groups, or sometimes they want to be on their own."
"If you're interested in the model of learning, you don't start from this production line mentality."
"These are, it's essentially about conformity."
And increasingly it's about that as you look at the growth  of standardized testing and standardized curricula.
And it's about standardization.
I believe we've got to go in the exact opposite direction.
That's what I mean about changing the paradigm.
"There was a great study done recently of divergent thinking, published a couple of years ago."
Divergent thinking isn't the same thing as creativity.
I define creativity as the process of having original ideas  that have value.
Divergent thinking isn't a synonym.
But it's an essential capacity for creativity.
"It's the ability to see lots of possible answers to a question,"
lots of possible ways of interpreting a question.
"To think, what Edward de Bono would probably call laterally."
"To think, not just in linear or convergent ways."
"To see multiple answers, not one."
"So, I mean, there are tests for this."
"I mean, one kind of cod example would be, people might be asked to say how many uses can you think of for a paper clip."
Those routine questions.
Most people might come with 10 or 15.
People who are good at this might come up with 200.
"And they do that by saying, well, could the paper clip be turned, and a foot tall, and be made out of foam rubber."
"You know, like, does it have to be a paper clip as we know it, Jim."
"Now, there are tests for this."
Factory farming is the biggest abuse of all.
Because in the United States alone there are 10 billion animals raised for food.
Its an extraordinary number and the average American eats 80 or 85 animals per year.
And we want to see that number reduced and we want to see the animals out of these terrible confinement systems.
And why do you think Al Gore didn't mention factory farming?
"You know I think that he probably thought that he was giving a lot of information already to people with An Inconvenient Truth, and maybe he thought that people would shut down if it affected them too personally."
"Because it gets very personal when you're talking about eating animals, and you're talking about something that is part of the American diet."
He thought all this is going too far.
But the public is slowly waking up.
I do not believe that we can have a good situation for animals or the environment if we continue to eat as much meat as we're eating.
"But even if you reduce your total consumption by half and instead of eating 80 animals eat 40, you cut in half the greenhouse gas emissions."
So we do think that our fork is a powerful tool.
"So, they're clear about this in the United States: the power lies with the consumer."
"As consumers, we can make a difference by changing our diets."
Matt Prescott says that meat is the number one cause of global warming.
And he gives a good example of this.
"If every American ate no chicken for just one day a week, then this would reduce just as much pollution as taking 500.000 cars off the road."
Chicken?
No thanks!
We'd rather have 500.000 cars!
It's funny.
"OK, I can hear you thinking:"
Meat and other animal products are bad for the environment.
I get it.
But don't we need meat and milk for our health?
"Where else do we get the calcium for our bones, the iron for our blood, and the vitamins and minerals we need to keep us healthy?"
"Advertisers and food producers have done so much to indoctrinate us, that you'd nearly end up believing it."
Go meat!
Sides of lamb are only 1.99 a kilo.
"The message is clear: milk is essential, meat is good for you, cheese is healthy for us all ..."
"But who benefits most from meat and dairy products, the consumer or the producer?"
Do we really need all that animal protein?
And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture.
"The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras, and those cameras can, frame-by-frame, reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment."
"So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject."
"And if you look in a comparison, on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us."
"So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this."
"But these were the early days of this technology, and it wasn't really proven yet."
We measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count.
"And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons."
We could go up into the millions of polygons.
It seemed to be infinite.
"This was when we had our ""Aha!"""
This was the breakthrough.
"This is when we're like, ""OK, we're going to be OK,"
"This is actually going to work."""
"And the ""Aha!"" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt, and we could put Brad in this device, and use this Contour process, and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights, and we could, in fact, scan him in real time performing Ekman's FACS poses."
Right?
"So, effectively, we ended up with a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing."
(Laughter)
"From there, we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face."
"So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes, a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing."
"Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44."
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
"We brought in Rick Baker, and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry."
"And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji, and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time."
"And we commissioned them to make a maquette, or a bust, of Benjamin."
"So, in the spirit of ""The Great Unveiling"" -- I had to do this --"
I had to unveil something.
So this is Ben 80.
"We created three of these: there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60."
And this really became the template for moving forward.
"Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad."
"So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct."
"I have some trauma or an injury, but I might have to run away from a lion tomorrow."
"So fix-fix-fix Sal now or fix David up so he can run away from a lion tomorrow, but in the wild I might not have lived to 40 anyway."
So why even worry about whether that person might get cancer if they get to 40 or 50?
Once they're past the point of reproduction.
Dr:
"Right, the body has to choose priorities."
The priority is today rather than tomorrow.
"An amazing study was done where we gave patients what we call a ""statin""."
Statins are drugs that were developed to block the synthesis of cholesterol.
"We thought, you know, people with higher cholesterol--particularly the bad one, LDL--those people have a higher incidence of heart disease."
"So, if we block the synthesis, we're going to affect heart disease."
What do you know?
We did!
A dramatic effect:
We lowered the death from heart disease with these drugs.
S: so it seems like they worked!
Dr:
Right.
"Then a company, or a very clever group did a trial where they gave people with normal cholesterol these drugs."
"It also had a dramatic effect, in that it delayed heart attack and stroke by almost a dozen years,"
Wow and it reduced the incidence of cancer by about 40%.
S:
"So cancer, something we don't normally associate with cholesterol."
Dr:
"So it turns out these drugs, which are the biggest drugs in terms of sells we ever had, worked by lowering inflammation."
"So the affected heart disease wasn't by lowering cholesterol, it was predominantly by lowering inflammation."
And the affect on cancer was by lowering inflammation.
"In fact, remember when the swine flu came out a couple of years ago?"
"If you got the swine flu, the only thing that protected you from your lungs collapsing going on what we call a ventilator, a breathing machine, was being on one of these statins."
S:
Because it would stop the inflammation.
"Because with swine flu, people were dying from inflammation going nuts."
So christians themselves seem to value ignorance.
The apple of the tree of knowledge - they shouldn't have eaten that.
"And, in the past, they've burnt books for freethinkers alike."
"I view this competition between real science and christian science as like watching a horse race where one horse, the christian sicence horse, has died in gates and never really made it out."
And the other horse has been going for 2000 years or more.
Which one will win?
We'll see.
"- If the finish line is right back at the start, then the dead horse got there first."
- Right.
"Like so many other areas, chrisitan science is a proven failure."
"Although, we're not alone here in picking on christianity."
"All the other religions,"
"like Islamic science, or whatever, Judaistic science."
It's all the same stuff.
"- It's pretty cool, too, because you can go to the Muslim science pages and they'll tell you everything that's wrong with the christian science pages, and the christians will tell you what's wrong with the Muslims, and they'll both tell you what's wrong with the Jews."
"Actually, I don't know that Jews spend a whole lot of time trying to make the Torah and Talmud match up to science."
- The Jews aren't big on marketing.
They're happy to have their exclusive club.
"- I think the most amusing use of science by Jews is actually using science, real science, in order to find a workaround for all the prohibitions for what they can do on the sabbath."
Which is really amusing.
- Little gadgets to push the button on the elevator so that you're not actually creating fire.
"- Or a phone that's always trying to dial every number and you have it stop not, whatever."
"Anyway, it's confusing."
Continue with your...
- Modern marvels.
"Well, today I'm going to talk a little about cosmology, which is one of the big topics that comes up, some other physical sciences, a little bit of mathematics."
"Another time, I'm going to save some of the more meaty stuff for other shows."
"I'll talk about the failure of creationism on another show, and I'll talk about the failure of chrisitian medicine on another show."
"So, so much fail, there must be a god."
The biblical cosmology is primitively wrong.
It's pretty screwed up.
"There's this notion of a firmament, which is this large dome that separates heaven from the earth in biblical cosmology."
"Finally, ask the patient to swallow."
It should be done without difficulty or regurgitation.
"Cranial nerve Xl, the Spinal Accessory nerve, innervates the sternomastoid and upper trapezius muscles."
"To assess this nerve, ask the patient to shrug his shoulders upward against your hands."
"During this maneuver, evaluate the strength and contraction of the trapezius muscles."
Practitioner:
Good.
Can you turn your head to... [fades]
"Then ask the patient to turn his head to each side, against your hand."
Observe the contraction of the opposite sternomastoid muscle and note the force of movement against your hand.
"Cranial nerve XIl, the Hypoglossal nerve, mediates motor functions of the tongue, which in turn affect articulation of words."
Inspect the patient's tongue as it lies on the floor of his mouth.
Observe for fasciculations.
There should be none.
Ask the patient to stick out his tongue.
"Note any asymmetry, deviation, or atrophy."
The tongue should protrude straight out.
"&amp;gt;&amp;gt; At this station, we're going to practice putting a naso-gastric tube in for a feeding tube and then we're also going to practice doing a bolus feeding and a tube feeding by a pump drip, continuous feed."
So first we're going to need a feeding tube.
"We could use, this would come in a clean package and I would have opened this up, and this is the Levin tube."
"That's a long, single lumen tube and it has pre-marks on it, to help you know to make your marking, to know how far you're going to insert it."
And so I'm going to put my clean gloves on and then I would have opened up my package.
"So I'm just using clean technique, because it's going into the stomach."
So I would open up my package that has a clean tube in it.
"And I took this out and have clean, now it's clean."
"First, I need to measure how far I want to pass it."
"So I want to measure it from the tip of the bottom part of the earlobe, all right?"
"The tip to the nose, to the nares, and then I'm going to add from the nares to the stomach, the middle of the stomach."
"So I want to about that marking, that's about how far I'm going to want to pass it."
"I want to have my patient with their head slightly forward, because if their was tipped back, that would open their airway, and I want to go into the stomach."
I can lubricate the end a little with water or may get some lubrication.
"If the patient's alert, they can swallow some ice chips while I pass to help this go down the right way."
"And obviously when a media corporation appears in a context of collective enthusiasm, there can be problems."
But I don't think it's very intelligent.
"I mean, I understand the reaction, but it has been proven afterwards that it's a reaction that doesn't benefit, but rather is detrimental for what was happening there."
You need people to insult you through the media.
You need people to manipulate you.
"You need people to distort your words, because there are a lot of people who don't succumb to that manipulation, who don't succumb to the insults, and who don't succumb to that distortion, and realises that you're not what the television says you are."
"It's a lot better to be insulted, I know it's a drag to say"
"""it's better for people to talk bad about you than not talk about you at all""."
"It's not exactly that, but you have to open yourself to the media and accept that they're going to hit you."
"Yes, they're going to hit you."
What's important is that there are other media outlets that understand you.
"Not because you're good to them or because they're on your side, but because ""each to his own"". there was a day"
"I was at an assembly where it was decided, or it looked that way"
"I think they didn't decide on it in the end, they decided that the only camera that could record there was the camera of the Sol audiovisual commission."
"You stop for 15 seconds to think where that's going to, what kind of model of communication it's going towards, and it's scary."
It's a bit scary.
Fortunately that didn't happen.
So there have been a few moments but in the end everyone always realised there was no sense in it.
But you see it's not coherent with who you are.
ST:
That is definitely NOT the 15M.
JL:
Definitely not the 15M.
Not letting the media work is not coherent with the 15M.
And yet I understand the indignation against the media.
Perfectly.
ST:
I participated in two assemblies in which I spoke about this topic.
About prohibiting cameras.
"One was on the 16th, I remember perfectly, the first day of the camp, saying that it was impossible. and the other was the same, but three weeks later."
And they were going on about the same thing curiously.
JL:
"Stone standing over our hero, who's been drugged and bound and gagged."
[music]
And we have this fight.
[music]
"It's an incredibly violent fight, but made much more tense, because no one in the scene can speak, our hero has been gagged."
The rescuers mute and of course the captain dare not say anything cause he doesn't want to bring the attention of the crew to them.
At the same time we hear off screen that calypso song.
[music]
"Which adds more tension because it really illustrates the distance between what everyone else on the crew is experiencing, and the horrors that are going on in this cabin."
How unaware they are.
"And also gives this counter point, which makes what we see on the screen all the more horrible."
Compared to the happy song going on off-screen.
"Worse and wells would learn about this, would learn from this."
[music]
In touch of evil.
[music]
"And Quentin Tarantino, of course uses the same technique of sound counterpoint to violence quite a lot."
"This is one of the first times, it's not the first time that I've seen it in a Hollywood film in 1943."
[music]
"And it comes from this B film from Lewton and Robson made at RKO. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; This is secure. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And of course, then, we come back to the voice over."
"And the odd thing is, Finn is supposed to be reassuring us that everything is fine."
"But if there's anybody who can't reassure us of anything, it would be Finn."
Especially when it's combined with this
"low key lighting in the bridge, and on the ship."
"And I dare you to call this a happy ending, in the end we come back to a place that's like the one where the film began."
"And it's important that when our hero goes and meets the new girl, who we don't see, we see only her shadow."
We feel the entire cycle beginning again this is our new Stone.
Because becoming a captain of ship losing yourself in work leads to this isolated madness in this world.
Now that is an overview how the film uses sound but the film also has these two set pieces.
Two moments that are there to push the audience to the edge of sanity by terrifying them.
And one set piece involves a hook and the other one involves a chain.
Now I recommend you go back and listen and think about how the chain sequence works.
Is this a future we want to leave for our children and grandchildren?
I don't think so either.
So let's steer towards a better future.
Thomas Berry wrote that our great work for our generation is to learn to live on the planet at least benignly.
Why would we do that?
"One reason we would do that is that our fellow living things, who happen not to be human, don't have a representative in Congress; they don't have a lobbyist in Washington, they don't have a voice at the table, and yet, they are completely dependent for their survival on our good will; much like children."
Let's talk about our country's population and our wildlife.
"We had about five million people in our country around 1800 and about 290 million people in 2000 - more now, of course."
"At a conference, I met a scientist, Andrea Laliberte, who had done fascinating work comparing wildlife sightings in the 1700 and 1800 in our country to how wildlife range today in our country."
"This chart, the pinkish areas - I'm not sure how it looks here - are where we used to have black bears."
The yellow areas are where they still are today
- you see there's been a lot of recession there.
This is the gray wolf; we used to have gray wolves running all over our country;
- the pinkish areas you see on the chart - not so today.
"We used to have grizzly bears running over about half of our country; as you see, they've receded, and we don't have them."
This was just 200 years ago.
That yellow island-like area
- that would be the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem.
"Let's look at a summary map: take a look at the right here - red is good, green is bad, white is very bad."
"You see that we've lost a lot of species in our country; those white areas mean that all of wildlife that was looked at,"
"- in this case, in the 1800s - it's gone from our country."
Do you think is normal not to have wildlife running around us all the time in our country?
That's not normal.
"Let's bring it home, here, to the Front Range of Colorado; tonight."
We used to have wild bison; they're gone.
We used to have gray wolves; they're gone.
"We used to have-- - sorry, my clicker's little sluggish - grizzly bears; could've been right outside."
They're gone.
"We used to have lynx, the cat; gone."
Maybe they are not leaving.
(Laughter)
"We used to have black-footed ferret, very dependent on prairie dog for their survival; gone."
Double recombinents are always the rarest class.
In this case the rarest class will be these right here.
"Now, when we look at this, which two of these genes are in the same phase and what's the third one that is in different phase."
Relative to the parents.
Here are the parentals.
And we can confirm that is actually the parental phase because that is most common.
"When we look over here, the rarest two have c been coming from the other chromosome, where's the capitals are together, just as they should be so, the little m, little b, big m, big c is necessarily the double recombinant, so it must have had something like this to come to double recombination event."
So the order must be B.
"A, C, B. So C is in fact in the middle."
"Now, what we can do, from those numbers you saw."
And you can do this for practice if you want.
You can go back and actually and calculate the recombination fractions.
The recombination between A and C is only 0.8 centimorgans.
"Or if you calculated it, directly it's 0.008."
Between C and B is 15.1% recombination or 15.1 centimorgans.
So we can infer from this since A was at 11P fifteen.
"Six, B is at 11P 12.3, C is probably at or near 11P 15.5."
"In fact, this gene is actually well known to be at 11P 15.5."
It actually has already been mapped and identified.
Now lemme conclude this video by just recapping one very important point.
Goal of genetic mapping is to localize alleles and genes that cause disease.
"What you're trying to do is you're trying to find, where is that unique allele,"
"like, which gene has it."
"Cuz again, genes don't come labeled."
"Even when you have the full human genome sequence, the genes do not come labeled."
Some markers will be associated with disease.
"And those ones that show that strong association where alleles at those markers, the gene attacked at that was the markers will, will be associated with whether or not you have disease, or will predict whether or not you have disease."
Those are ones that will be near the disease-causing gene.
Okay?
Some markers will not be associated.
It will be very weakly associated with it.
And those are the ones are that are likely far away from the disease causing.
I already mentioned a few cities that we are actively working with.
But there are so many more that we could and will be working with.
"So again, just to illustrate my point, here is a snapshot from Google Analytics that shows the geography of visitors to the webpage of my institution."
"And it's really not a webpage on which you can bump, it's not advertised, you really have to look for it."
So people who have found it have some interest in the same things that I'm interested in.
"Yes, as you can see, it covers almost the whole world."
"I know, I think we have to work on Greenland, but apart from that, it does cover the whole world."
"I guess what I'm trying to say is that contrary to a popular belief,"
"NGOs are not just about giving, they are as much about getting back or receiving."
"I started with a number, and let me finish with this number."
"Think of us, 7 billion people,"
like molecules running around.
"What you, I think, don't want, as Bertrand Russell would say, is to be like a hard, separate entity, a bit like a billiard ball that can have no other relationship with other such entity, except that of a collision."
"What you also don't want is to leave your chances of meeting those 150 most amazing friends of yours to a pure chance, because if you're going to sit home, nothing will ever happen."
"So my suggestion is to do something, and to do what?"
"To support, to get involved in one of the existing NGOs, or create a new one."
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning.
I'm going to tell a story.
I think I need a piece of technology here.
Thank you.
Now I just have to figure this out.
"I'm going to tell a story about -- ecology, which is a story of plants and their parasites."
"If you'd like to take a look at one of the parasites, you and I do every morning when we look in the mirror."
(Laughter)
"This story is literally the flow of energy and there happens to be one exquisite transducer, the land plant."
(Laughter) (Applause)
"And I'm not one of the people from Australia, either."
(Laughter)
"That story is literally better told by another set of constructs which is basically the cycles that make life possible, because life is made of the same materials."
"You and I have the same molecules that were in Plato, were in the dinosaurs, were in literally the first blue-green algae, as they emerged 3.5 billion years ago on Earth."
"Let's say, serious vote of no confidence and a serious use of patient of congressional authority."
"Now, it's."
Set the ball user patient of congressional authority because the congress voted it.
"By the way, when we were pushing or discussing this, who do you think was most [inaudible] against this provision?"
The congressional staff.
The staffers on the house ways and means committee really hated this.
Why did they really hate it?
[inaudible] in the heat but every time they're going to consider changing the Medicare law or the.
Right?
They didn't have power.
"They've got either the device people or the doctors, or the hospitals, or the drug companies, or the patients, everyone [inaudible] arguing why the opposition is right."
They have a lot of power.
"They just given up the power to some other organization, you know who are they?"
The [inaudible] decision made by someone else.
They're n obody.
They really hated this.
"Those staffers, they went berserk."
"But, the President made clear that this had was one of the, absolute [inaudible] parts of the bill."
I believe it will not be [inaudible] that this not another Republicans blew it.
How did they blew it?
Anyone following the news?
They blew it by their [inaudible] appeal to [inaudible] reform.
What does that blow it?
Democrats aren't interested in.
"Now, reforms stand along and they get enough for it."
So.
The ambition of project Velocar match one of the great stakes of our time : sustainability of our mobility.
"Before the end of this decade our big, fat and oiled powered cars will inevitably have to be reinvented."
"That's fortunate, we are not alone thinking this way."
"You may have heard of the recent Twizy, a two seated electric micro-car."
"And well before this, the velomobiles with their simple yet clever idea : get rid of you car problem, by replacing it, with you bike !"
"In practice, a Velomobile is an aeroshell that sits on top of a trike to help you brave wind, cold and rain on your everyday rides."
URLs.
These URLs were created by things like different types of navigation.
"So Googlebot, in terms of crawling your site, doesn't just look at, say, 200 unique URLs."
"But actually has to determine which URLs to crawl of the 380,000 that were created."
You can see how
Googlebot might want to be more efficient in crawling by looking at these two URLs.
"Now, the first one says, ""category equals YouTube."" Let's say that URL to 20 unique items on the page."
"But on the second URL, it's ""category equals YouTube and size equals medium."" So it's the exact same items."
"But now just say, filtered down to five."
"Because of the ""size equals medium"" parameter."
So in this way Google would rather just crawl the first URL and reach all 20 of the items.
Rather than crawling both URLs and seeing a redundant five items.
"Essentially, with your input in URL parameters, it helps us to understand your site better."
So we can crawl more efficiently.
"By crawling more efficiently, we don't crawl as many duplicates."
And that will save you bandwidth.
And helps us to focus on your unique content.
Rather than crawling the duplicate of information repeatedly.
"But if you want URLs removed, you can go to URL Removals in Webmaster Tools."
"Again, the URL parameters feature is to crawl more efficiently."
It's not about removals or explicit robots.txt disallowing.
Another background piece of information that I'd like to mention is that page-level markup is still taken into consideration in tandem with URL parameters.
So if you have page-level markup.
"Like rel, ""canonical"", or rel, ""next"" ""prev"", or rel, ""hreflang"", that's fine and can still be used by Google."
Even if you are using URL parameters.
Just make sure that we can still crawl your page.
Meaning that it's not robots.txt disallowed.
Or you haven't set it to not be crawled in URL parameters.
"As long as we can crawl your page, we can still use the page-level markup."
"Since we've covered the background information, let's now talk about the types of URLs that are eligible for this feature."
Here's one from the Google store.
"It says, ""category equals office."" Other URLs would be things like ""category equals wearables"" or ""category equals wearables and size equals medium."""
And going to college.
Just whoever was - There never seemed to be any shortage of people that could play.
Somebody played an accordion.
I can't remember who that was.
What did Walter McCauley play?
Guitar.
Did he sing?
I'm not sure.
Who were the singers?
Rita was one of them.
Rita?
Jules's wife.
Mary's mother.
I'm not sure.
"Oh, Loraine would get up - every once in a while she'd get up and do the tap dance thing and all this kind of stuff."
That would be entertaining more than a singer as far as...
I didn't ask the question.
I didn't take that risk because of being concerned about that my question is going to appear stupid.
"And learning about our own tendencies and understanding how certain situations may interfere with our other goals of actually learning and developing is very important in our self knowledge and in our ability to regulate our own motivation and say, I recognize this in me, I can see how this is holding me back and I'm going to regulate my emotions and shift my goal."
Or consciously adopt a learning goal orientation in order to pursue learning.
And part of the process that allows this to happen is what Ricarose is doing which is engaging people in conversation.
"How did you feel about this, what did it make you do and how would you cope with this and learning from each other and recruiting the community and supporting you in regulating your own motivation."
Natalie:
And we do it in a genuine way because we want to understand and then that gets them reflecting.
I've seen that also in this after school program with the University of illinois in Urbana-
"Champagne, part of a project called the Pathways Project where we're interviewing young people and staff in a variety of after school programs."
And asking young people to reflect on some project they've worked on over a period of time.
And through the interviews you start to see that they start to realize some things.
"Like they were preparing for a presentation, some of them said, I was going to do anything to get out of this situation."
"But because of their team, they didn't want to let their teammates down, they went and then they realized, oh actually it wasn't so bad."
"So these multiple experiences of working on projects and then having questions where you reflect back, like what did you think it was going to be, how was it?"
"And a lot of them are finding, oh actually now I want to do more of that."
"G can get to F in two steps, and that's an improvement because before the best we could get to F was 11 steps."
"Now, we can get to F in ten."
Can we get anywhere else new?
"No, cause the only nodes that are complete now are B and F, and they're already in the picture, and in fact, now we see that the fastest way to get to F is going to be in ten steps cause the only other way to get to F that we haven't considered is getting there through B, and that's going to be longer."
We can lock this down.
Alright!
"So, let's look at F."
"What edges are coming at F to uncompleted nodes, just this one to B."
That would have been F is ten steps plus one more would be 11 to get to B.
"That's an improvement over what we had before, and that's it for F."
"Now, the only node that we've got left to think about is B."
There's no way to get to be any faster than 11 cause there's no other place that we can go and then get to B.
"We can lock it down, and that finishes the picture."
We now know what the shortest distance is from A to === in the graph.
The distance to B is 11.
"Now, we've kind of lost a little bit of information of how we get to B in 11?"
"But, we'll deal with that in a little bit."
Good morning to everyone and above all to our guests.
"A warm "" thank you"" to Mrs Di Ture who represents the General Direction of our Education Department."
"I myself thank you because I don't have any merit for this event, I am only doing my work according to the general political and administrative lines of our Institute , which I consider more useful for our students."
"This activity was led by Mrs Calò and a starting group of Section A classes infact I think that this first step was made by our V A and to them, to these students our thanks must be given for what they have made and for what other students will be able to do on their example"
Let's look at multiplying binomials.
"For example, if we want to multiply (2x+5y) (3x-y), we could take this entire binomial here and distribute it to each of these two terms, which would give us (2x+5y) (3x) + (2x+5y) (-y)."
"And again, we can distribute this 3x to these two terms, as well as the -y to these two terms, which gives us (2x) (3x) + (5y) (3x) + (2x) (-y) + (5y) (-y) = 6x^2 + 15yx - 2xy - 5y^2."
"And now, 15yx and -2xy are like terms because yx and xy are equal by commutativity."
"So we can combine them, which gives us our answer of 6x^2 + 13xy - 5y^2."
"Now, this type of multiplication comes up often and there is an acronym used to describe it."
And the acronym is FOlL.
"The F in FOlL stands for First, which means we multiply the first terms in each binomial."
"So, a * c."
"The O stands for Outer, which means we multiply the outer terms in the two binomials, so a * d."
"The I stands for Inner, which means we multiply the inner terms of the two binomials, so b * c."
"We cannot make energy saving window without toxic materials in it, otherwise it doesn't work."
"So, this means to reinvent our materials to go into technical cycles."
"So, we now make washing machines where you can wash just 3000 times."
"We now make materials which can go into technical cycles, and biological cycles."
But this means reinventing  everything you see in front of you.
"We don't need to say, ""Oh, I'm so sorry to be here."""
"We can say, ""Hey, we are not good enough."
"Our design is not good enough  because it makes toxic waste."""
"Now, we try to minimize our footprint but we reach the opposite"
"We are making the wrong thing perfect, and by that, they are perfectly wrong."
"When we send these things to recycling, we only contaminate the biological system."
Because it was never designed for recycling.
"The design that you do is so important, but right now this design is amazingly primitive."
"Look, I became a designer."
"You can see when you look in the internet, you find I'm designing materials,"
"I'm designing materials like washing machines that only do five thousand loads of washing,"
But this is because the designers don't do their job.
I'm designing edible fabrics.
What we do see here?
"Stinking PVC, never designed for human beings."
Destroying fertility.
The whole system is very primitive.
That means that we need to reinvent all our materials again.
This is the amount of diapers which one baby makes in one year.
"In Europe, 20% of all waste stream in households are diapers."
"And, because they get older, the diapers get bigger."
There is some potential in it.
"A baby takes about 7,500 diapers."
"If we could make diapers for babies, which allow them to go into biological systems, if we change the soap absorbents and the plastics, we could grow with one baby,  150 trees, just with one baby."
So this baby could be carbon positive from the beginning.
"It's really carbon positive, not carbon neutral."
"With learning how to use the sun, we can reinvent everything to go back into technical systems and biological systems."
"So we've chosen the things that sort of solved the most complexity like being able to send an SMS with one click, being able to navigate some of it with one click."
"There's one that I didn't demonstrate, which I use, like, ten times a day, which is to say, ""Note to self,"" and then, you know, ""Buy milk on the way home,"" or whatever reminder you want to send yourself."
"I'm sure many of you geeks here send yourself emails all the time, trying a reminder."
So we're trying to solve the biggest problems before we try to voice-enable everything.
"The next step, by the way, is to actually open the voice actions platform with a public API so that third party developers can then start adding different actions to do anything, right?"
"So, Spotify, for example, could say, ""Well, it's great that a user can launch Spotify and play a song or a playlist, but what about controlling the playback?"" You know, ""What about being able to say 'pause' and other thing like that?"""
"So we're going to open up the voice actions API for that stuff, and all of these actually are doable today because there's an open API on Android itself for speech."
Hopefully that answered that question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KELVlN:
I'm looking forward to that.
"And the second question is to--I'm sorry, the second question is to Eric."
"Now, Google TV is one of the best of product from Google, right?"
Okay?
What's your strategy to get Google
"TV into China market, because I'm a Chinese, right? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Well, our current strategy is to try to get it."
"Because of the partnership you saw, it has to be integrated with the content provider."
"We're trying to get it launched in the next couple of months in United States, and then we'll do a worldwide launch later or basically in 2011."
"And I won't go through the details on a per-country basis, but it's pretty obvious what we need to do."
"We need to talk to the broadcasters and make sure we have the content, get the thing certified."
"Televisions are, in fact, offered by the local manufacturers."
They have to actually install the software in their televisions.
"Go ahead. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Dr. Schmidt, I'm really sorry, but I've Googled your schedule, you only have time for one more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
One more question. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And please try and keep it to one question.
"So, anymore?"
I think the gentleman all the way in the back.
If you could stand up and just announce yourself.
Thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; POPl:
"Hello, my name is Luppa Popi from Symantec Eds and my question is, what's your view about Apps?"
Everybody is talking in Apps and Apple has taken this phenomenon to the
last stage.
"And when we talk about Apps in two or three year's time, what will be the mash up use cases from the Apps. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
First is I think the iPad Apps have really shown a very good model.
"The stars and the sun are fixed to the dome, and this dome rotates around."
The earth is at the center.
It's flat.
"It's got corners, according to the bible."
Hell is somewhere below the earth.
Day and night was created before the sun and the earth in Genesis 1:4-5.
"According to biblical scholars like Usher, the age of the universe is somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 years."
"Although, they're not quite sure which. and the universe was created by god from nothing, from the void."
"In acutality, in reality, the earth is a planet, one of many in the solar system."
"There is no firmament, no sphere out there."
The sun is the center of the solar system.
The sun is a star on the spiral arm of a typical galaxy with billions of stars.
"The Milky Way is a galaxy, one of billions in the universe."
The age of the universe is 13.
"75 billion years, and the universe was created by natural processes from a singularity, as far as we know."
"So, lots of wrong here."
Lots of screwed up cosmology.
"Aristophanes, back in 2000 BCE, measured the size of the earth."
"He knew is was a sphere, and he measured the angle of the axial tilt."
"So, that's pretty impressive."
"Galileo upset the incorrect church's view using observational astronomy in the 1600s, and pointed out the foolishness of the church's position."
The church was not too happy about people using telescopes because they thought they were going to look up the skirt of god or something.
"Poor Galileo spent most of the rest of his life under house arrest, after that little episode, under fear of being killed."
"There's a long list of astronomers and others who have expanded and refined our understanding of the universe, and they continue to do so today."
"So, meanwhile, the church and the bible has contributed nothing."
"Yet, they're happy to claim credit."
"They say god did it, or whatever, and there's this notion of the god of the gaps, where, if there's something that's not known, well, that's a good place to stick, that's a god-shaped hole to stick god in there, and that explains it."
"But, as we learn more, that gap gets smaller and smaller and smaller, and it's really just an argument from ignorance."
"For other physical sciences, let's talk about lightning, rainbows and materials."
"Okay, lightning."
The chrisitan view up until the 18th century was
lightning was the wrath of god.
The message that arrives at Bob is not C. It's C'.
"Because at the perfect cipher, the attacker can't learn anything new about the message from C, but she could modify it."
Maybe she had a pretty good guess.
Maybe there was a number in the message somewhere or something that she wanted to change.
"Well, she could flip the bits at that part of the message, change the ciphertext that Bob receives to C."
"It would decrypt, and with the one-time pad encryption and decryption are the same function."
The decryption of C' would be M'.
"The attacker can actually control the difference between M and M', because the way the one-time pad works is just XOR."
The attacker could decide whatever difference she wants to introduce in the message.
This is a dangerous property for a cipher to have.
Another big problem with the one-time pad is that it's very impractical.
"The real reason that it's impractical is because the keys have to be as long as the messages, and we can never reuse the key."
The is this property that the number of possible keys is equal to the number of possible messages.
Maybe what we should try to do is to find a more practical perfect cipher.
"Unfortunately, Claude Shannon proved that that's not possible."
That's what we're going to look at next is why this property that the key space has to be at least as big as the message space i s a requirement for a cipher being perfect.
"Let's take a look at an approach for actually finding shortest paths in graphs, and we'll use this example once again."
"It will help to actually have names for the other nodes, so I'm going to add these in."
Just remember what breadth-first search does for this graph starting from A.
We mark A as visited and we add it to the open list.
We pull off the open list and add all the neighbors of A to the open list.
"Letter C, B, and D then we choose one of these nodes,"
"Let's say C and add all its unexpanded neighbors to the graph, but all its neighbors are expanded."
"Do the same thing with B. B has F, and D's unexpanded neighbors are E."
"Now, F's unexpanded neighbors are G, and E has no more unexpanded neighbors."
We finish this step for a search.
"What we get here is that by the assumptions of breadth-first search, the shortest path from A to B is this direct link from A to B."
"The search would have actually terminated here, but we ran that anyway."
These are supposedly the shortest paths in terms of number of hops to all these nodes.
It actually makes sense.
"One hop to C. One hop to B. One hop to D. Two hops to F, sure."
"Two hops to E, sure."
"And all that means is that if we see a register being reused, like over here, we have two assignments to the register X. Okay."
"We're just going to introduce another register name, for one of those assignments."
"So in this case I'm just gonna rename the first, use of X here, definition of X here to be some new register B. I'll replace the uses of that"
"X, by the name B, and now I have an equivalent piece of code that satisfies single assignment form."
"Every register is assigned at most, once."
Let's take a look at an optimization that depends on single assignment form.
"So we're going to assume the basic blocks are in single assignment form, and if they are, then we're going to know That a definition of a register is the first use of that register in th e block, And so, in particular, we're also ruling out things like this."
"So there could be something like this, where X is read."
"And then later on, X is used."
Okay.
"Sorry, X is read and then later on, X is defined."
So we're not going to allow this.
"This register here would have to be renamed to something else, say Y, And then uses of X later on here, are renamed to Y. Alright, so we're going to insist that whenever we have a definition Of a register in a basic block."
That is the first use of that register in the block.
"Alright, and if, if that's true, if we main, if we put things in that form, and that's, that's easy to do as we've seen."
"Then when two assignments have the same right hand side, they're guaranteed to compute the same value."
"So, take a look here, This example."
"So let's say we have an assignment, x=y+z."
"And then later on we have another assignment, w=y+z."
And we said that there could only be one assignment to x in any basic blocks.
"So, all of these instructions that are [inaudible] here, they can't be assigning to X. And they also can't be assigning to y and z."
Y and z already have their definitions.
"So, y and z can't be changed."
And that means that x and w here actually compute the same value.
"And so we can replace the second computation Y plus C by just the name that we already have for it X. Okay, and this saves us having to recompute values."
Alright so this is called common sub expression elimination.
Common it's a rather long name.
Sub expression.
The elimination.
"And this is another one of the, more important compiler optimizations."
This is actually something that comes up surprisingly often.
"And saves quite a bit of work if, if you perform this optimization."
We're not going to do it in the US.
It's just too--it's too creepy. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
"Okay, Doctor Schmidt. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Is that where you are? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
It's me. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Oh, there you are."
Sorry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:
Okay.
My name is Doctor Shiga.
"Actually, I just picked up the example of the cathedral."
"Actually, you know, you spoke about the organ of the cathedral."
My mother was one of those who have the chance to play this organ. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Ah, good. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I would like to say, when you come back to Berlin we will offer you a concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"Oh, thank you. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SHlGA:"
"And I say that because I wanted to discuss a topic, which you haven't discussed with us today, but I heard in the grapevine that there is something behind the curtain which may be of interest for us, but it's up to you to spoke about."
It's about generating and retrieving and working out proper memory.
"As you know, all this digital age we're approaching, we speak about the future."
"But I think maybe some of the most important challenges is not just hosting data, but it's not just giving us the data of our actual life, but actually hosting parts of our past."
"And I know that there are some projects in the way in the background of your big, big, big empire which are working on that."
"Maybe it's too early to speak about that, but maybe you can give us at least some ideas about these things which are less on the future which will have to do with our past and once we are done, we give you the concert. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Thank you.
"Well first, thank you, sir for such a kind offer."
We're very interested in getting historical information into Google.
"Usually, that historical information is owned by somebody; a library, or a cathedral, or a church, or what have you, and so we have organizations that go and talk to them and try to get that information to be published."
We want to be very respectful of copyright.
We don't want to do it without their permission.
"But most people, when we talk to them, are very interested in getting their information out because it helps popularize what they're doing."
"The more information we have, the more signals, the more information that we can have that we link things together."
I don't think there's anything particularly special about music or sheet music or any of those things.
We have a number of projects around going on a pro bono basis trying to do digital images of the original vellum of recordings from hundreds of years ago.
But our real objective is just to get all the information digitized.
"And he has realized that, as a doctor, he has no business being around a mother when she is giving birth."
So he gave up.
Eating fish is not a medical issue.
"However, when a fish bone gets stuck in my throat, then it can become a medical issue."
"By the same token, it's very important that we don't consider a mother who is giving birth to be ill."
The same way I'm not ill when I'm eating a fish.
Psychiatry and obstetrics are two of the most insane fields within the world of medicine.
"All of us and all doctors were once born, so doctors have their traumas."
"And somewhere it's about 'why should children enter life easier, happier and more loved, than I did when I was born?'"
In a way it's about jealousy too.
"'If it was hard for me, why should I make it easier for these children?'"
"It may sound strange, but I'm absolutely certain that it is part of the deal too."
Semmelweis had scientific results.
He didn't have a microscope.
"He didn't see bacteria, he couldn't prove his case, but the patients of those doctors who had washed their hands didn't die."
He saw things very clearly.
"When he felt doctors were the cause of childbed fever, that they became murderers unknowingly with their own unwashed hands as they assisted with births right after performing autopsies He saw it, he knew it."
"But when he mentioned it, he got expelled."
Doctors couldn't dare to imagine and acknowledge that for long years they had been hurting and killing women.
Semmelweis wrote a letter that breaks one's heart when reading it
"He wrote a letter, in which he was begging doctors to stop the old process immediately and he was asking them not to push this opportunity aside just so they wouldn't have to feel guilty."
"This regime, this mentality causes fear."
"Love is a virus when it spreads, but fear is also a virus."
It is a terrible virus.
"I would recommend obstetricians that they stand up immediately, today and say something."
I don't understand what they are waiting for.
What are they risking?
Is it that they would all be expelled with their licenses revoked?
"Agi's colleagues, obstetricians, experts"
Why are they silent?
What are they waiting for?
"Are they waiting for Agi and a few other brave obstetricians to be punished, and then ten years from now they will find their voices?"
"And when we solved this equation, we would know exactly where the two bodies would be at all times."
"As long as we know where the bodies were when they started out, using that force law and this equation of motion, we could tell you what r would be for all future times."
That's called deterministic.
That's classical mechanics.
"Well, we're not going to do it, but we could actually set up a differential equation and solve for what r(t) is using that force law."
We could do that.
"And if I did that and if I started out the electron and the nucleus at one angstrom from each other, like they are, roughly speaking, in an atom, what would happen is that that electron would plummet into the nucleus in 10^-10 seconds."
"If I solved these equations,"
I would find that r would be equal to zero and t equal to 10^-10 seconds.
We've got a problem here.
"The problem is that this classical physics,"
"Newton's second law and the force law, it is predicting that after 10^-10 seconds the electron and the nucleus are on top of each other, they've neutralized each other."
We no longer have an atom that has a diameter of 10^-10 meters.
That's contrary to our observations.
This is saying the atom collapses in 10^-10 seconds.
But what we see is that the atom seemingly lives forever.
"So we've got a big problem here, as they did in 1911, 1912."
And the problem is that this kind of classical way of thinking does not predict our observations.
"It does not predict the fact that the atom lives together, it lives forever."
It says the atom falls apart.
"So it could be that the Coulomb force law is wrong, or it could be that this equation of motion is incorrect."
And of course what's going to turn out is that this equation of motion does not work for electrons in atoms.
You cannot use classical mechanics to describe the electron within the atom.
"We need a new kind of mechanics, and that new kind of mechanics is going to be quantum mechanics."
That is where we will pick up on Monday.
Have a nice weekend.
"When I was growing up in Montana,"
I had two dreams.
"I wanted to be a paleontologist, a dinosaur paleontologist, and I wanted to have a pet dinosaur."
And so that's what I've been striving for all of my life.
I was very fortunate early in my career.
I was fortunate in finding things.
Generally speaking there's not a real problem for health if we have much lower meat consumption.
And there are potential benefits.
I mean after all colon cancer is one of the commonest cancers in high income countries.
And the risk of colon cancer is higher with high meat consumption.
"So there would be a real benefit in terms of colon cancer risk, for example."
Going from our level of consumption to something that's just a bit below half of that would not involve any significant health harms and would almost certainly bring health benefits.
"As you have probably already guessed, I'm a vegetarian."
I actually used to like eating meat quite a lot.
"But that was until around twelve years ago when I saw a Dutch TV documentary called ""What the cow wants""."
It contained some really bizarre footage.
This hole was made a few years ago.
Cows can live very long with this.
Sometimes more than ten years.
This is a hole with a diameter of around 4 inches.
Inside there is a silicone ring.
With inside a lid.
"When I push, it should be possible to open it."
Now it's open.
The lid comes out.
Here we have a part of the grass the animal just ate.
"When I saw this, for me that was the very limit."
"Animal diseases, animal suffering, animals that were no longer treated as living beings."
I had seen it all and I thought:
"""No, not in my name!"
"I want no part in this any more."""
And that's how you put the lid back on.
"In the factory farming industry, animals are adapted to the food that we choose to give them and the massive stalls in which they are forced to live."
"They are mutilated, they are given antibiotics to stop them getting sick."
Pigs are now sometimes even given anti-stress pills to help them cope with their unnatural living conditions.
"Yet the fact that it turns out that livestock makes an enormous contribution to greenhouse gas emissions by belching, farting and defecating doesn't necessarily mean that we'll start keeping fewer cows, pigs and chickens?"
"No, the industry will simply dream up something new."
"Would you believe it, they now even make fist-sized pills to stop cows from farting so much?"
The new basis is orthonormal.
"Therefore, β0 is equal to v0 inner product with x. β1 is inner product of v1 with x."
"In compact form, we can write β0, β1 as a matrix vector multiplication with a matrix R, which is a rotation matrix."
"A key fact of the rotation matrix, that you can easily verify, is that R transpose times R is equal to identity."
Let's compute a square norm in the canonical basis.
"So, the square norm of x is equal to α0 squared α1 squared."
"In the rotated basis, it's equal to β0 squared plus β1 squared."
Let's verify Parseval.
"So, β0 square plus β1 square is equal to the vector β transposed times β."
This is equal to Rα transpose times Rα.
We reorder the terms.
"We find R transpose R in the middle, but this is equal to identity, so, we have α transpose time α, which, indeed, is equal to α0 squared + α1 squared, verifying Parseval's formula."
Let us now look at approximation.
The problem is the following.
"We have a vector x that belongs to a space v, and we have a subspace S, that is included in v."
"We would like to approximate x with xhat, which belongs to S."
"Of course, there are various ways to do this approximation."
"We are going to be interested in approximation that minimizes the quadratic error, meaning, the difference between x and xhat should be minimum in quadratic norm."
"If we have an orthonormal basis for S, so Sk, k going from 0 to K-1 is an orthornormal basis for S."
"Then, the orthonormal projection will simply be x hat is equal to the summation of the inner product between x and Sk times Sk."
"This orthogonal projection is the best approximation over S, in the sense of least squares."
"So, the least square approximation has properties that it will give a minimum, quadratic error norm."
"So, among all y's that belong to S, the ones that minimizes the quadratic error is x hat, and the error is orthogonal to the approximation."
"So, x minus x hat, inner product with x hat, is equal to 0."
We're going to see this graphically now.
"So, we are in R2, x is a vector in R2, the subspace s is a one dimensional subspace."
And we start exploring what would be the closest point to x belonging to s.
"So, we put circles, we let them grow."
"And as they grow, at some point they touch s, that will be our point x hat, that's given by the blue vector."
And the difference x minus x hat indeed is orthogonal to x hat.
"To make this more concrete, let us look at an example, namely, polynomial approximation."
"So, we look at the Hilbert space, PN, from -1 to 1."
"And as your velocity changes, the distance and time also change."
That's the equivalent of rotating the coordinate system.
"But there is something that doesn't change, and let me write that down."
This is usually given the Greek
letter Tau [T] squared.
And this is equal to (Δ x^(2)) + (Δ y^(2)) + (Δ Z^(2)) - c^(2) (ΔT)^(2).
And this is invariant.
"This is an invariant interval, sometimes called proper distance."
"And as you change your velocity--as the space, as the mass, as the time all change--this quantity, describing the separation of two events--so, this describes the separation of two events, that quantity changes--doesn't change."
That quantity is invariant.
"Okay, so now, this answers one of the questions that was asked before."
Why does one use c^(2) or c to transform the space coordinate into the time coordinate and back?
It's because you need the c^(2) out here in order to make this invariant.
"If you're calculating the distance, if you use x^(2) plus 1/2 y^(2) or some other constant times y^(2), you're not going to get something that's invariant."
"And it's only when you use the c, here, that you end up with something that's invariant."
"And so, if you think about these as representing the four coordinates of the system, it's clear this one coordinate is x, one is y, one is z, just as you would expect."
"And then, there's this other coordinate, which is c times T, but it's negative so it has to be times the square root of -1."
"So, the four coordinates in space-time can be thought of as x, y, Z and i cT, if you want to think of it that way."
"And the time coordinate is imaginary, because when you square it, you have to end up with a negative number."
Don't worry about the details of that.
"But the presence of the c^(2) here is why you have to use c, in particular, to get from time to space and back."
And that's necessary because this is the thing that doesn't vary with velocity.
All right.
"So, this is actually kind of a weird expression."
"Because unlike the distance between two points--and you'll notice, these three terms put together, that's just the distance squared, ordinarily, but that is not invariant anymore, because there's this other term here, which can vary."
"Unlike the distance, this doesn't have to be positive."
You've got three different cases here.
This interval can be zero for different points.
"In ordinary distance it can only be zero if the two points are the same, but this can be zero for different points, for different events."
"It can be zero, it can be negative, and it can be positive."
"So, what does that mean?"
What happens when it's zero?
"If they're not equal, then you have too much of one and not enough of the other."
"So basically, what we can do is we can solve in this example-- in this example, we could say the marginal product of labor is 1/2 k over the square root of k times l."
The marginal product of capital from this production function is-- once again I'm using this production function q equals square root of k times l.
Marginal project of capital is 1/2 I over square root of k times l.
So the ratio of the marginal products is simply k over l.
"The marginal rate of technical substitution, given this production function, is k over l."
That's the marginal rate of technical substitution.
"So this says that given this production function and these prices, at the optimum you should set k over I equal to w over r, which equals 1/2."
"So what this says is given this production function, these price ratios, the optimal thing to do is to use half as much capital as labor."
"Half as much capital as labor is the optimal thing to do, and that's what we see in figure 9-2, is the optimal thing to do is use half as much capital as labor."
"Now, in other words, let's say, to now develop the intuition."
"Imagine you told me no, I should use as much capital as"
I should use labor.
As much capital as I should use labor.
Imagine I told you that.
"Imagine I said no, in fact, the efficient thing to use is why not have one machine for every worker?"
How would you tell me intuitively why that's wrong?
Why would I be wrong to say use one machine for every worker?
"Why would that be wrong, given the prices prevailing in the market?"
Someone can tell me this.
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"Well, renting machines is a lot more expensive than paying more workers."
JON GRUBER:
Twice as expensive to rent a machine as get a worker.
AUDlENCE:
So it would be more cost-effective to have the workers share machines rather than get a whole new machine.
JON GRUBER:
"The key point is the machine costs twice as much, but the machine doesn't do twice as much."
The machine and the worker do the same thing.
The marginal rate of technical substitution is one.
"You're indifferent between one more machine and one more worker, but the machine cost twice as much as the worker."
"Well, it turns out that a lot of us forgot somewhere along the line that are actually all of knowledge is connected."
"When you hear someone remarkable, whoever they are, share something of their passion or what they do, not only you're inspired by them personally, but you start to see connections that you didn't see before between what you do and what they do, or someone else does."
"So, we spend our lives digging these trenches."
"That's we get really good at one thing, and that's where we live, that's where we're focused."
"TED is the moment when you come out of your trench, and you ascend up a slope, and you see how what you do connects with whatever else does."
It can be really eye-opening and thrilling.
It can fill you with a new sense of possibility.
"So in, let's see, 11 years ago, I was certainly digging my own trench."
"I was trying to build this technology publishing company, magazines, websites."
I was in it deep.
"This was the year, I first went to TED."
I was smitten.
"You know, I'd always thought of myself  as this slightly ""Odd Man Out."""
"Like I always struggled to make conversations about house and God and family gossip, movies, celebrity, and all the things I think normal people talk about, do they?"
(Laughter) (Audience) We don't know.
CA :
(Laughing) 'We don't know'.
That was a great comment!
"At TED, I found myself surrounded by this motley crew of geeks, sort of passionate entrepreneurs, inventors, creators."
"Really, they didn't have a whole lot in common except that they were all very curious, they were all absolutely eager or willing to talk out-of-the-box ideas and to engage in conversations that depending on your view point, rather a little bit crazy or might turn out to be really important."
"I loved it, I thought I'd come home."
"And, the media entrepreneur in me noticed something as well."
"So, media were obsessed with this."
Attention is a currency.
"We measure it in lots of different ways: we measure eye balls, how many are there, ratings, circulation, and so forth."
"We also look at demographics, who owns those eye balls."
Bill Gates is worth more than Billy Blogs.
"And, there is a third measure of attention that is much harder to measure."
"So, we don't often talk about it."
We should because it is the most important of the three.
It's the measure of thequality of attention.
Is it focused or casual?
"Its not a physically invariant object, Lorentz transformations change it and indeed this distance means nothing physical and reading it off the graph produces no useful information."
"So, it is not true that I can measure off distances."
"They see and on the same scale as I did over there and thus, we figure out where the t prime equal to two save point is."
"So, how do I do it?"
"Well, if I really want to plot where along the t prime axis, the point say t prime equals to one is, what I need to do is the following construction: remember there is something that is preserved in this weird and is physically meaningful in this low ends relativistic world, and that is that c^2 t^2 - x^2 is the same as c^2 sorry for the color violation here, minus x prime squared."
"And along the t prime axis well, that's the point where x prime = zero."
So
I can erase that.
"Furthermore, along the t prime axis, x = vt because this describes the motion of the left side of the ladder which is moving with speed v. So I get that c^2 - v^2."
T squared is equal to equal to c squared t prime squared.
"I am going to eventually figure out exactly the time dilation, relativistic time dilation formula which is that t prime is t times square root of one minus v squared over c squared."
What does that mean?
"That means that the time here, t prime at this point is less than one."
If I draw the point t prime equal to one.
It will be somewhere over here.
And the point t'= two is somewhere over there.
Notice that the scales of the two axis are different.
This is confusing and troubling.
"It has to do with the fact that what is physically meaningful is this Lewenstein Distant, distance if you want this sort of weird distance with the minus sign rather than the Euclidean distance that were."
Is the distance that we observe in the graph.
And you can perform with negative value for the interval a similar calculation.
And you will find that the scale of the x-axes also is extended.
And in general in any space-time diagram the scale is smallest.
And the Observers.
For the observer that is addressed.
"In other words if I draw here the lines of constant x, the constant t prime and the lines of constant x prime then I find indeed that if I drew."
"X equals one, two, three and CT is one, two, three."
"And I then want to draw the lines of x prime equal one two, three."
Then I need to draw them approximately here.
And then x prime equals three would
"lie, lay, lie way over there."
"And likewise, t prime equals to one would be way up here, and two and three and so on."
"Salts, you know, sodium, all of that will damage the soil and damage your plants."
"You want to avoid boron or borate, that's also going to damage your plants."
"And chlorine bleaches obviously, you know, kills things; you don't want to send it outside."
The next thing to kind of just get a little more informed is there's a lot of chemicals in our personal care products that are really just not good for us.
"And it's not really a plant issue or a Greywater issue, but it's often a good time when people are going to reuse their water, they want to think about well, what's in this stuff I'm using?"
"And so, if you're interested in doing a little more researches to database, it's called cosmeticdatabase.org."
And you can enter any product and they'll tell you what's in it.
"You know things are, oftentimes, it's kind of shocking to do this."
Any of you guys tried this?
Not yet? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; No. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ALLEN:
"I think it's frightening, so be ready if you want to go down that route."
But it's definitely informative.
You can find out all sorts of things about the products.
And then the other thing is there's products that are recommended.
"So if you don't want to do lots of research, you know, we can tell you what products that we've researched and found to have no salt, no boron and not a lot of other carcinogenic things that are in a lot of products."
"So here are just a few examples like Oasis, Biopac, Ecos, Aubrey"
"Organics, there's more too."
"So, I'm going to talk about kind of some basic things with"
Greywater and this is just for the first way that outdoor simple systems.
"And a lot of times, it's really--Greywater is this unique source of irrigation."
So that's kind of common sense knowledge with other types of irrigation don't really fit with Greywater.
So it's important to kind of understand it and see the different kind of do's and don'ts of Greywater irrigation.
"So the do's, the things you want to do is mulch."
It's a really important component of a system.
You guys know what mulch is?
"Yeah, it's just like woodchips, you know, things covering up your landscapes so it's covering the soil."
Mulch is really important for Greywater.
You also--you always want to have a way to go back to the sewer.
"It's called a three-way valve, and Greg's going to show you one example in a sec."
You want to use plant-friendly products because it's going outside.
"And then you want to use--I put a proven designing clothes because there's, you know, so many different ways you could get your water outside."
"And there's lots of ways people can tinker and, you know, get it to go out there."
So thank you and thank you for listening.
(Applause)
"Hello, and welcome back to Introduction to Genetics and Evolution."
In the previous videos we looked at how to study the process of recombination.
And specifically how we can leverage recombination to actually map genes associated with diseases.
"And again, as I've said several times, we are looking for an association."
"Between alleles at markers, such as these hapmap SNP markers that we discussed, and a phenotype such as disease status."
That is essentially the what we're trying to do with genetic mapping.
"Now what we're gonna do in this video is, we're gonna actually try to map simple genetic traits."
So traits controlled by one gene that have a very large effect on that trait.
Relative to genetic markers [inaudible].
So.
We can actually use hat map markers just
like we use it for soft limitations in previous videos to map simple genetic [inaudible].
"So remember we did these problems using these three [inaudible] markers, a, b and c."
"And we did the case of the test cross with an individual that was heterozygous for all three, so it gave little a, big b, little b, big c, little c."
"Crossed to somebody who, who's homozygous."
"Little a, little a, little a, little b,"
"little c, little c, little c."
"Now we can imagine that A and B are snip markers with, you know, so they necessarily have two or more oleos, and that they have a known location in the genome."
Now what we can say now is maybe C is the disease gene.
"So what we're trying to actually do with a lot of genetic mapping, this isn't all of mapping but part of mapping, is to determine whether C, the diseased gene is between a certain pair of markers."
"And secondarily, about how far is it?"
"Like is it, for example, between A and B?"
"And if so, is it closer to A or is it closer to B?"
"Or is it off to one side, maybe out passed"
A and further away from B?
That is genetic mapping.
"So let's, let me illustrate this with an example."
I will be using concepts very much like what we did with [inaudible] mapping of genes.
Let's use cycle cell anemia.
"Now this disease is recessive, meaning you have to have two copies of the mutant type to exhibit the disease."
ladder.
"Remember, this was the instant when the right side of the ladder pokes out of the right side of the garage, and so I look at this equation and I say x prime two is equal to L, so I say L over here."
"And that is going to be equal to'x',"
'x' is'g' because it's at the right side of the garage and then minus'v' times't2' and then divided by the square root'1' minus'v' squared of over'c' squared.
"And okay from this I can solve, everything here is known, except for T2."
"So I multiply by the square root as I'm always doing, move the square root over to here."
"Notice I get the foreshortened length here, and what I find moving things around is that vt2 is G - L * the square root of one - v^2 / c^2 by construction we said that this is less than G so vt2 is positive because I was running fast enough."
"This number is small enough, the Lorentz constructed ladder fits into the garage."
"That means its right end will emerge from the garage after the left end entered. perfect that's what we set up in the garage's frame, the ladder fits into the garage."
How does this look in the ladder's frame?
Well and indeed there is this whole time as I said between the time the left end enters and the time that the right end exits that the ladder is completely contained in the garage.
Good for us.
"On the other hand, what happens if I look at the same thing from the point of view of the ladder, what I want to know is at what time did as measured by the"
"ladder, did the right end of the ladder exit the garage, so I want't' prime at this same event."
That turns out to be easier to extract from the inverse transformations.
So again x is equal to g.
So I put it g over here.
Over here x prime is equal to l.
"And I want T prime, so again I can solve for T prime."
And I find that V T prime again multiplying through the square root.
"I find that'vt' prime is one over, the square root of one minus'v' squared over'c' squared times'g' minus'l'."
"Now, G is less than L, this is a number less than one."
"T2 prime is negative. remember that T2, T prime = zero and also, Tzero, = zero was the time when the left end of the garage entered the garage."
"But here, the right end of the garage emerged before."
"So indeed, in the I adder's frame of reference, the ladder was never in the garage."
You couldn't close both doors.
"Because, as far as the ladder is concerned, before the tail end of the ladder entered the garage, the front end of the ladder was protruding."
"So what happens you ask if the garage owner in his frame when the ladder is completely as he sees it contained in the garage, swiftly closes both doors."
"Well, lets follow that in a graphic representation which will give us a chance to play with space time diagrams and see some of their strengths and limitations."
We could also do the calculation this way but I wanna demonstrate a graphic method of solution.
So hopefully.
"What we, what did we get from here?"
I pay nothing.
If there was some initial membership charge then maybe we would add that membership charge and you would pay the monthly fee after that.
"But here this looks about right, that the dollars paid is equal to 40 times the time in months."
The time in months is the independent variable.
"It drives the dependent variable, the number of dollars you pay."
"So these are turkeys, and this is electrified also."
This is space age stuff.
There's a little stainless steel filament.
See it running through the horizontals?
"These, the verticals, are dead."
The horizontals carry the spark.
This is really a major breakthrough in pastured farming.
"This poultry net material, we get ours from"
"Premier in Iowa, it's only been around for about 20 years and it took computer chips to be able to shorten the spark length down to 4 thousands of a second, to get the resistance"
load low enough so it wouldn't melt the polyethylene.
"So this is why I say, I am not a [indistinguishable] by any stretch, we embrace technology."
"But it's cool that this netting comes in a 150 foot roll, weighs 12 pounds, one person can take it up and put it down in 10 minutes, and it keeps out bears, coyotes, wolves, possums, skunks, racoons, and keeps the turkeys and chickens in, and all those predators out."
Who would have guessed that you could have that eighty years ago.
I noticed that there's no covering
like we see with the chickens.
"Is it because at this stage, at their size, the aerial predators don't become an issue."
"Exactly, at this point the aerial predators are not an issue."
"The group over there is three weeks younger, than this group here, this group is eleven weeks old, that group over there is eight weeks old."
Are they getting ready to harvest?
"No, they'll go to sixteen weeks."
"Again, what keeps us awake at night is trying to figure out how to scale these things, and all that."
"So this is a ""gobbledy go"", this is the latest ideology of a portable turkey structure."
"This thing is 32 feet long, 12 feet wide, these are roosts here."
"But the thing to notice is, they're just lodged boards."
So these purlins up here are just lodged.
"The point is that in five minutes you can pop all these off, pop the purlins off, fold up the shade cloth, now you're down to just eight feet, hook up to a pick up truck, and you drive down the road at 55 miles an hour."
And why do you have these in here for?
"And we tagged them very simply, not very high-tech, with a big, long pole."
This is a beachcaster rod with a tag on the end.
You go up in your boat and tag the shark.
And we were very effective.
We tagged 105 sharks last summer.
We got 50 in three days off Inishowen Peninsula.
Half the challenge to get access is to be in the right place at the right time.
"But it's a very simple, easy technique; I'll show you what it looks like."
We use a pole camera on the boat to actually film the shark.
"One, it's to try and work out the gender of the shark."
"We also deployed some satellite tags, so we did use high-tech stuff as well."
These are archival tags.
What they do is store the data.
A satellite tag only works when the air is clear of the water and can send a signal to the satellite.
"And sharks and fish are underwater most of the time, so this tag actually works out the locations of shark, depending on the timing and the setting of the sun, plus water temperature and depth."
And you have to kind of reconstruct the path.
"What happens is, you set the tag to detach from the shark after a fixed period -- in this case, eight months -- and literally to the day, the tag popped off, drifted up, said hello to the satellite and sent, not all the data, but enough data for us to use."
This is the only way to really work out their behavior and movements when they're underwater.
And here's a couple of maps that we've done.
"In that one, you can see that we tagged both off Kerry."
"Basically, it spent all its time, the last eight months, in Irish waters."
"On Christmas, it was out on the shelf edge."
"Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet with sea-surface temperature and water depth, but again, the second shark spent most of its time in and around the Irish Sea."
Colleagues from the Isle of Man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the Isle of Man to Nova Scotia in about 90 days.
Nine and a half thousand kilometers -- we never thought that happened.
Another colleague in the States tagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.
His tags didn't really work.
"All he knows is where he tagged them, and where they popped off."
"His tags popped off in the Caribbean, and even in Brazil."
"We thought basking sharks were temperate animals and lived in our latitudes, but in actual fact, they're obviously crossing the equator as well."
"So very simple things like that, we're trying to learn about basking sharks."
One thing that I think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks is.
"Alternatively if you only have one copy, we, if you're heterozygous we refer to you as a carrier."
"That means that you probably had a parent that had the disease for example, not necessarily but you probably did."
"Now let's imagine you're, you're serving a"
"lot of families and you have multiple cases of carriers, these individuals that we know are heterozygous for the disease, having kids with affected individuals."
When I say affected individuals I mean ones who actually have the disease.
"So you're crossing somebody heterozygous for the disease, the carrier, with somebody homozygous for the disease."
So this is again just like the test cross we did before.
Well lets say you have the gene attached for the parents and for the offspring.
But you don't know what the gene is causing the disease.
This is a very important point.
You do not know what or where the gene is causing the disease.
When I say you have the gene attached to the parents and offspring I mean you have their genes attached for a bunch of genetic markers.
You don't know where among those markers the disease-causing gene is.
"So let's, let's focus on two genetic markers on chromosome eleven."
"Let's say that you've already, from something else you already have some idea that, that this disease is caused by mutation on chromosome eleven."
Which actually is true by the way for sickle cell anemia.
Let's say you have two markers.
Let's say the A marker is at this point.
There's a picture of chromosome 11's chromosome Let's say the A marker is that this location.
I just made this location up.
Don't worry about that.
Let's say big A big A might be an individual's homozygous for the letter C for the nucleotides C in that position.
Big A little A has T at one copy and C at one copy.
Little A little A has T at both copies.
"This is, this is irrelevant."
I just wanted to give you some idea what I mean when I'm saying these snip markers and big A and little A. So this something just to make it more real in the context of a DNA sequence.
The important thing is that A is over here on a chromosome and B in contrast a little bit lower down on the chromosome.
So what are we trying to do?
We're trying to see is the gene causing
Sickle Cell Anemia between A and B?
Is it down below B or is it at that little area above A?
That's what we're trying to figure out.
YOU ARE NOT ALONE HERE you... you are not alone here
Then he thought:
"""The joy leaves us whihtout even getting to know us..."
At the same time SOMETHlNG is reminding about itself again and again...
Then he thougt:
"""Approaching the cherished line closer and closer will we acquire something in each other person...?"

This is an introduction to what we'll be doing in Week one in Physics twelve.
"Basically, we'll be looking at the characteristics of science."
This includes that science is divided into topics.
This you'll mostly read about in the textbook.
We'll also talk about how to be human activity.
"Again, this is mostly in the textbook."
"We will talk about the science of philosophy, this will show up in the"
"lectures but if you want to review the sections, these are all in chapter one."
The fact that it's practiced by a community. the institutional aspects.
"These are going to come a bit more later in the course, but I'll review briefly in the textbook."
"The fact that there is a specific method or process, we'll start that this week in the lectures but that will be the focus in the next two weeks."
"And the fact that it's constrained, this will be a key element of what is done in discussion this week."
"Or if this is a purely online version of course, we would be doing that in the forums."
"The philosophy of science, something that we will start looking at this week contains a few key parts."
The first being that the
laws of the universe are discoverable.
The universe is noble.
"The second is that science is repeatable, this is a key part in the online lectures but is covered in the book."
The laws are uniform and invariant.
"The laws are simple, and the"
laws are objective.
"These are ideas you definitely want to start becoming familiar with this week, but we will keep coming back to over the next couple of weeks."
The three things that set the groundwork is the scientific process.
"And those would be the scientific method, which is the advanced version of what you learned, probably in grade school."
This is how the individual scientist does his work.
Susan Calvin develops the positronic brain.
She designs their three laws and their implementation.
She is very important.
She is also unattached to any mails.
"Interesting, she's a wise old woman, she's not in any way part of the Eden complex."
She's much more like the female god.
"At the end, in the evitable conflict, she confronts Steven Bierley in his office."
"And she acknowledges that the whole world wonders whether or not he, who seems to be keeping everything running so well, whether or not he is not himself a robot."
"I mean, how can you distinguish perfect robots from human beings?"
"Earlier in the novel, Susan Calvin had said the only difference between a robot and a human being is that robots are essentially decent."
"Well, Stephen Bierley doesn't answer her."
"He doesn't prove his humanity, and he doesn't prove his robot nature."
"He doesn't admit to anything he says in fact, which either a robot or a human would say, humans would not like to know that a mere man controlled everything."
"And humans would not like to know that a robot, a mere machine had taken over the government of the human population."
"And so it is better for human beings not to know whether I, Steven Barley, I am human or a robot."
We can't argue with that logic.
The last image of the story is a fireplace behind a quartz fire screen and we look in it and a flame goes out and a wisp of smoke rises.
When I first read that I thought well the whole book seemed to be working its way toward utopia.
But I know what it means for a flame to be extinguished.
"Hey when a flame goes out, you know, that's the end of insight."
That's the advent of darkness.
"This is, this is negative."
The robots have taken us over.
But it didn't fit with the rest of the book.
"Well if you read the book as a series of separate stories that just happened to be published together as an anthology, what difference does it make?"
So one of the stories doesn't actually fit thematically with the others.
"But if you read it as a composite novel, How do you make sense of that smoke?"
"So, one day I was speaking to a colleague of mine, a quite prominent our historian and as soon as she heard this she said that's the Merode Altarpiece."
The Merode alter piece?
The Merode Altarpiece is a key example of a medieval iconographic trick.
"When in the annunciation, when the archangel Gabriel announces to Mary that she will bear the child of God."
"The Devine Light goes across from Gabriel as God's messenger to Mary striking sometimes in some paintings into her head, sometimes into her womb."
Last Probe for HuK!
"Three hit points left on this Stalker, it is trying to get around to the smoke."
"The Zealot is coming around, to try and swing it."
"Going into the smoke, the Zealot, will it kill the Stalker?"
"It is regenerating a lot of shields, now up to 20 shields is the Stalker, and NaNiwa might have done the impossible!"
"- His shields are coming back, that's exactly what he needed."
"The Probe are trying to get a surround, the Zealots are getting some shots off, down to 13 shields."
"NaNiwa, be careful, please!"
He needs those shields to come back.
"HuK trying to track down that Stalker, it is going to come down to micro here, trying to trap him."
One miss click and one of these players will lose the game.
And the Probe going for the kill.
"Down to eight shields and three HP, this is absolutely the most insane game I have ever seen."
Insane micro from both of these two players.
"The Stalker running around, trying to stay alive, trying to micro the best he can."
"HuK is hilariously trying to mine with the one Probe he has, trying to get more units on the field."
"But, this is an insane game Kibbles."
"- Axel, what has happened here?"
"While all of this is occurring, HuK is currently taking, he has taken out the Nexus with a Zealot, and NaNiwa has no chance of having an economic recovery."
This Stalker is his last hope to victory.
All the buildings could eventually be killed here by the Zealot in the main base.
NaNiwa has a clock ticking.
But he is managing to maybe kill one of these Zealots here.
"HuK, ultimately may end up needing to bring the Zealot from home."
This type of situation is called a dominant strategy in that confess is a dominant strategy for player 2 meaning it's always the best regardless of what the other guy does.
"Think about this the other way around, say we make some guesses as to what player 2 is going to do and then when we say in each case what's player 1's best response in that situation."
"So if player 2 confesses, what's the best thing for player 1 to do?"
"Say if player 2 confesses we're over here on the right somewhere we say player 1 can either get 5 by confessing or 0 for being quiet this problem is looking strangely familiar, say well 5 is better than 0 so player 1 is going to want to confess."
Now if player 2 doesn't confess what should player 1 do?
"So if player 2 doesn't confess, we're over here on the left somewhere and player 1 can either get 10 by being quiet or 15 by ratting out his buddy, well 15 is greater than 10 so he's going to want to confess."
Notice here that because we confessed in both cases confessing is also a dominant strategy for player 1.
So here I've circled player 2's best responses in green and I've circled player 1's best responses in blue and you'll notice there's one place here where they over lap to say that in this situation where both parties confess both of them are responding as best they can to what they think the other person is going to be doing.
"So, they can be described by four numbers, three spatial coordinates and a time coordinate."
They can be anything.
"You know, turning on a light, doing anything you want to do."
"Receiving a photon, whatever it is."
But they are points in a four-dimensional space-time and therefore require four numbers to describe them.
"And you can only get from one to another if they're separated from a time-like, that is to say, a negative, interval."
"Okay, so this expression, which I'll write down again, this is called a metric."
And the particular metric that I've written down here is the metric for flat space.
"Because remember, this is special relativity."
"There's no masses, no curvature of space, none of that stuff, yet."
This is the metric for flat space with no mass present.
And there are many other metrics possible.
"Any time you add mass or do other things, you get different kinds of metrics more complicated than this."
"So, what's special about special relativity is that you use the metric appropriate for flat space as opposed to the many other different kinds of metrics that you can use in general relativity, which has a much more general form for the metric."
"I should say, you can also write this down."
You can write down the spatial terms here in polar coordinates.
Remember polar coordinates?
"Polar coordinates, you describe the position in space, instead of with x, y, Z, you describe it with a radius, a distance from zero, and some angles."
"And it turns out, that's convenient to do so."
"Let me write this down in polar coordinates, or in polar."
That's an r.
Let me write that explicitly.
"This is an Omega, that's some angle."
And then the T thing remains the same.
And I've pulled a little bit of a notational fast one on you here.
I've gone away from the deltas and I've written these down as d.
This is the differential d.
Those of you who have taken some calculus will remember this.
"If this were a calculus-based course I would explain why I did that, but I'm not going to."
"So, just allow me this slight of hand, here."
"For technical reasons, these have to be differential."
Yes?
Let us see the words of the Tiferet Israel who is one of the commentators of the Mishnah.He writes as follows.
"""Man is compared to a tree in the bible and his wisdom is his honor"
"like the honor the branches are to a tree."""
"Wisdom is beauty just like the branches beautify the tree. ""the observance of the Mitzvot of the Torah is like the roots of the tree.The Mitzvot themselves  are the roots,when a person fulfills them.Look how contrary this is to the way people think."
"""Though,when he becomes too knowledgable.."""
"Like a person who studies a lot in the Kabbalah centers they have today,where he studies and studies but doesn't observe anything practical."
"So he says when he becomes too knowledgable,""He is like a tree that used up all his energy for its branches thereby making its energy too dull for its roots."
"Meaning,the investment itself turns out to be a deficiency."
"It is known that in nature,every tree whose strength spreads  to the very top doesn't have enough strength for the bottom."
"And the two of them,meaning the one who has many branches on top and the one who has few roots below,will uproot more easily."
Same goes for a man like this.
"""By the branching out of his wisdom of God's hidden laws"
"He learns and learns,the hidden aspects of the Torah,Kabbalah etc."
"So will the roots of his heavenly fear be lessened and weakened in his heart."""
Why?Because he doesn't apply or fulfill.
And they will both be the reason for his fall.When the wind of heresy captures him at the end it will completely uproot him from his eternal area of success.
"Meaning,you may see a person"
like this whose wisdom specifically will bury him at the end and uproot him.
Therefore it is so important to know that alongside the wisdom that a person acquires he must also apply the Mitzvot and fulfill them in everyday life.
We will conclude with one more special thing that we learn from the world of vegetation.
That is the topic of the  resurrection of the dead.
"There are many who wonder how a person who passed away and was buried,will once again be resurrected."
It sounds illogical.But a person who stands before God and asks
"Him,Tell me,God,will you really resurrect the dead in the future?"
"We've buried a person,how can he rise?"
What does God answer him?
"He says,are you surprised that I will do that?"
I do it already.
I do it in the world of vegetation.
How can a seed grow?
"You take the seed plant it in the ground,cover it and water it."
"It goes through a certain process  and suddenly from within this process where just a minute ago the seed  looked like something you could grind and make flour or bread from and now it looks bad.But from this bad looking seed,a stem comes out with a few dozen grains at its head."
And that separation is 0.088 millimeter.
"If we make the openings much narrower, indeed, the light intensities would be more uniform, each maximum would be approximately the same strength, but then very little light will go through."
And so it's a trade-off.
"And the moment you make these two openings, these two slots,"
"larger and larger, you will understand Friday why then the light intensities are not the same, why the light intensity is a maximum at the center and then falls off near the edge."
As you see.
"It's a maximum here, and then the light intensities become smaller."
"I've shown you now the interference pattern with sound and for red laser light, but imagine now that I did the same with white light."
"The situation would be very different, and maybe even disappointing for you."
Let this be the location on the screen.
"So we -- we have X here, and here X is 0."
"And I want to know where the maxima are in the red, well that's very easy, there will be a maximum here when this position is L times lambda divided by D."
This is when Nancy is 1.
And there will also be a maximum here when we have 2L times lambda divided by D.
"And of course there will be one on this side, same distance."
"And there will be one here, this is when N is 0."
N is 1.
N is 2.
The red light will have maxima.
How about the blue light?
"The blue light will have maxima here, where L lambda divided by D, but lambda is different,"
lambda for blue light is smaller.
"Substantially smaller than red light, so the maximum of the blue will fall here, the maximum of the blue will always fall at N equals 0 together with red, and then Nancy equals 2 the blue will fall here, so this is Nancy 2, Nancy 1, Nancy 0."
"And here Nancy 0, Nancy 1, Nancy 2."
And so the red and the blue and therefore all the other colors
live a life of their own.
They don't talk to each other.
They come in with their own separation in terms of angles and in terms of locations X. That's the reason why I chose one and only one frequency with the sound.
"Because if I had exposed you to many different frequencies, many different wavelengths, then the location of silence for one wavelength is not the location of silence for the other wavelength."
And so the experiment would not have worked.
"And that's why it worked so well with the laser, the red laser, which is practically one wavelength, and so the minima and the maxima are extremely well-defined."
"If we had done the experiment with white light, it wouldn't have been so impressive, and on the next slide I show you what you w- would have seen then."
We keep on going on like that.
We'll go out 1000 different steps.
"Each of these will be a distinct state, because this will be the state with time t equals 0."
"Here time t equals 1, t equals 2, t equals 3."
"But really, although it looks like we're getting different states, in another way of looking at it, we're always getting the same state."
We're just going back and forth from here to there and back to here and back and back.
We're going around in circles.
"In order to recognize that these are in fact the same states, we're going to have to take t out of our state, and we're going to have to deal with the t someplace else."
"We want our representation of a state to be just (here, there)."
We've got to figure out someplace else to put the t.
"I'm not sure what the right way to do it is, but why don't we do it this way?"
"We have a path, which is state, action, state dot, dot, dot-- keeps on alternating between states and actions."
"Let's change that so that the path is a state followed by a tuple of the action and the total time it took after applying that action, then the next state, then the next action and the total time after applying that, and so on."
That'll be our new representation.
"States are going to look like that, and paths are going to look like that."
"Now, I want you to write the new successor function for the bridge problem."
"We'll call it bsuccessors2--the ""2"" just to keep it distinct from the first version."
Again it returns a dict of state-action pairs.
"A state now is just a two-tuple of (here, there), and the here and there are still frozen sets."
It's pretty much the same except we dropped out the time t.
Go ahead and implement that for me.
"Hey Pokémon fans, I'm JWittz and for today's Pokémon fact of the day, we're going back to the Pokédex to talk about more reasons why it is NONSENSE!"
Now I've done plenty of videos in my extended series on weird and creepy Pokémon Pokédex entries (and I'm sure I'll do more of those in the future) but for now we're going to talk about something a little different: sizes and weights.
They don't make any sense.
Just how big is a Charizard?
"Big enough to ride, right?"
"If you're asking Game Freak, you might be wrong."
"Despite Pokémon having the most successful long-lasting media franchises of the past two decades, size just seems to be one of the things they can't keep consistent."
"Most of the time, we think we have a good grasp on the size of Pokémon thanks to the TV show, other shows we've seen, and referencing Pokémon to real life animals."
"But when you look at the official, cannonical sizes from the games themselves, things are a little messed up."
"For starters, the anime differs from the games greatly by having the occasional giant pokémon appear."
"This never really bothered me as a kid, but today it just baffles me for some reason."
"And now, we've already written it as a fraction and if we want we can simplify this down."
"Both 8 and 10 share common factors, they are both divisible by 2."
So lets divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2.
"We are not changing the value of the fraction because we are dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same thing 8 divided by 2 is 4, 10 divided by 2 is 5 and we're done."
"0.8 is the same thing as 8 tenths, which is the same thing as 4 fifths."
"Welcome, hope you had a good summer."
"I just wanted to talk about the class since there's about a week or so left before it starts, believe it or not."
"I, I have put something on the set, on the web."
And it's a detailed syilabus for the class.
And I would encourage you to take the opportunity to read it.
It's a big document simply because I want to give you clear sense of what you're going to get into.
And you want to make a decision that this class is good for you or not.
And even though you have resisted I encourage you to read it.
It gives you a good sense.
"But what I'm going to do in the video is I though I would give you visual idea and talk to you about the class, and it reflects what's in the syilabus."
"But hopefully, easier to follow, and motivate you to go read the syilabus."
The first main thing I will talk about are the objectives of the class.
"And to me, the main objective, the first one, is to learn how to value assets."
Assets are what create value in the world.
"And if you know which is a better asset than the other in terms of creating value for the world, I think you're on board."
"You're going to make good decisions, and that's the second, if you may, practical."
"Purpose of this class, to understand value, to make good decisions."
"And if you can make good decisions, it kind of empowers you, to feel comfortable in a very uncertain world."
"You're not guaranteed to make great decisions, but you will probabilistically make better decisions and that's what you want."
I want you to understand your environment and what public policy's all about.
Why is that important?
"Because, as"
"I said, Finance's beauty is about valuing assets but making real life decisions and all of this happens within a context and in fact the context is an outcome of our actions."
"So if you understand the interaction between decisions and what's happening and public policy, it will help you."
Now will it be a perfect understanding?
No.
"But I guarantee you when you read the popular press, you'll be able to understand things a bit better."
"And so we're at a stage now, where we're running more than 20 projects, where we have humans and robots  collaborating together."
"We have the robotics systems that take the data,"
"like poor Kepler up in space, and then we have the humans down here on Earth, who are able to analyze the data."
So humans and robots are able to work together in harmony.
Except that it never works like that.
We've all seen the Sci-Fi movies.
"We all know that the robots  always go wrong in the end, and this is the vision of my nightmare."
"This is the future that we're heading towards, expect it doesn't quite look like this, it looks more like this."
"Because this particular machine that's going to run roughshod over our classifiers, is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope."
This is a telescope being built right now.
It's going to be on a mountaintop in Chile.
It's as big as the biggest telescopes in the world right now.
But it's a survey telescope.
It's going to scan the whole sky once every 3 nights.
"And it's no exaggeration to say, it's going provide a movie of the universe."
We're going to see all the asteroids whizzing around the solar system.
We're going to see all stars flickering as they have star spots.
"We're going to see the planets, we'll catch those transits."
"And we're going to see the centers of galaxies flicker, as material falls down into the black holes that lurk within their centers."
But to cope with LSST is going to be a challenge.
It's going to produce roughly 30 terabytes of reduced data each and every night.
If all we care about is things that change in the universe --
"let's simplify the problem: a conservative estimate is that we're going to have half a million alerts, every single night."
"Even if all of you, even if everyone watching, even if we all commit to doing Galaxy Zoo and its friends, we're not going to cope with this."
So we need new solutions to combine the machine with the human.
"But luckily, there are things we can do."
The first thing we can do is we can just be smarter about using people's attention.
We could pay attention to what it is that machines can do.
Maybe they can classify the routine events.
We can let them do that and we can give only those things that really need human attention to the humans.
The other thing we could do is that we can educate our volunteers.
"We can use the power of the Zooniverse, the power of citizen science to train up a generation of volunteers, so that they're able to take on the task of dealing with the truly unusual things that LSST is able to provide us."
So then let's look at the implementation side of this and I have an implementation in here I want to get rid of.
Sorry about this but I
left the old one in here.
That will do all the things that will need to get done.
Okay.
So let's deal with at the beginning.
"Starting off, right, we will set the cursor to zero."
"So that's the vector gets started, initialize empty, and nothing else I need to do with the vector."
"A character [inaudible] cursor position in that, and then moving the cursor position forward, it's mostly just doing this, right, cursor plus, plus, right."
It's just an easy index to move it down.
But
I do need to make sure that the cursor isn't already at the end.
So if the cursor is less than the size of the vector then I will let it advance.
But it never gets beyond the size itself.
So
like all of these are going to have same problems.
"Like, if I'm already at the end and somebody asks me to advance, I don't want to suddenly get my cursor in some lax stated that sort of back that."
"Similarly, on this one, if the cursor is greater than zero, all right, then we can back it up and move the cursor around."
Moving the cursor at the start is very easy.
"Moving the cursor to the end is, also, very easy, right."
We have a convention about what it is.
"And so then inserting a character is, also, pretty easy because all the hard work is done by the vector."
"When I say insert this new character at the cursor position, right, then this character advance the cursor to be kind of past it, and then deleting the character, also, pretty easy."
"Let me show you, before I go finishing the cursor, I just want to show you this little diagram of what's happening while I'm doing stuff."
So this is kind of a visualization of the things that are happening.
So this is showing the vector and its length.
And then the cursor position as we've done things.
"Inserted six characters, the cursor's currently sitting at the end, and for the length of the cursor, actually, the same value right now."
If
"I issue a back command, right, that deducts the cursor by one, it shows another one backs up by one, and then eventually the cursor gets to the position zero and subsequent backs don't do anything to it, it just kind of bounces off the edge."
"And moving forward, things are easier to deal with."
"It will advance until the gets to the length, the size of that text, and it won't go any further."
I had a dream my life would be...
So different from this hell I'm living- so different now from what it seemed...
Now life has killed the dream I dreamed. piano
"Hi, my name is Nat McCullough on behalf of Expert Village."
"In these clips, we're going to talk about the proper way to remove and replace a front wheel drives vehicles ball joint."
"In this clip, we're going to talk about removal of the ball joints retaining nut."
There are two styles that you may possibly run across.
This one has what you'd call a through bolt.
"As you can see on the ball joints stud, there's a grove."
"The retaining bolt runs through that grove, something?s similar like this and clamps down and keeps the ball joint from coming off."
The other style you may run across is that the ball joint will be threaded on top and then actually a large nut will go down on top of it and hold it in place.
"Due to room constraints on front wheel drive vehicles, almost nine times out of ten, it will have a through bolt."
That eliminates the need for the stud to be bigger and having a large nut on it.
"Generally on pickup trucks, light trucks, and things of that nature, you will see the threads on the top."
So pay attention to that.
The nut and bolt is located right down here.
As you can see.
What I'm going to do is put an opened end wrench on the nut for bolt.
And use my three inch ratchet with the socket on the other side.
"You can see how I set my wrench on there using the spindle to actually hold it for me, so"
I can use both hands on the ball joints containing bolt.
And there you go.
"It may be necessary, just depending on how corroded it is, to actually have to screw the bolt out of its location."
"You can see, as I'm turning it the bolt is beginning to come out."

PROFESSOR:
Last time we were talking about binary search and
I sort of left a promise to you which I need to pick up.
"I want to remind you, we were talking about search, which is a very fundamental thing that we do in a whole lot of applications."
In that one we would go and check to make sure that the M characters match if we have a hash match.
And then if it could be that with such at a low probability could be that there's a hash match but not a substring match.
Then we're just.
Move on.
And from a theoretical point of view there's some very extremely low possibility that one could be slow.
But lets look over at what the analysis says.
So the theory says that if you take a sufficiently large random prime say mn^ three So a long value maybe you can get that and remember n is huge.
"Then the probability of a false collision is about 1/n. so you know in a billion things you might get, you might get 1/n, you might get a false collision."
"So in practice we choose actually q just to be, there's no reason not to choose as"
"large as we possibly can, not related to m and n.m And then the probably collision is going to be about 1/q."
"So we're going to take it to be like the biggest law, and that means that probably collision is extremely small."
And then you can take your chances.
You can do a Monte Carlo version where you just say I got a match because I got a hash match.
And be confident in the laws of probability.
And not worry about the client getting the wrong answer.
"Or you can have the Las Vegas version where you go, go ahead and return the correct answer."
And.
"And be confident that your client's not gonna run into a slow case cuz the probability is so, so tiny, 1/q, that you don't have to worry about it."
That's the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
"Now, why look at this algorithm?"
It's linear time.
We have other algorithms that are linear time.
"One of the key reasons to, be interested in Rabin-Karp is that it's easy to extend it to more complicated situations."
"So, say you wanna look for one of, several different patterns."
"Well, you just compute the hatches for those patterns, and then look for any one them Use, a symbol table, to look for'em."
"So, that's a much more, general capability than, we can provide with the other methods."
It also can be extended to do 2-dimensional search and other things like that.
"For straight suffering search, it's gonna be a little slower because, there's, interloop it's kind of long, the arithmatic operation, are gonna be a"
"little slow, if you wanna do the Las Vegas version you have to back up the text and you have this, Monte Carlo Las, Las Vegas thing, and you should think about, writing code to extend it to look for any one of p possible patterns, thats, an interesting,"
Algorithmic puzzle as I mentioned is not so difficult to solve.
So here's our summary.
"We started with a brute force algorithm, and although typically you don't have this worst case thing."
And we know from the other property of linear transformations that the transformation of a vector multiplied by the scalar is the same thing as the scalar multiplied by the transformation of the vector.
That's just from our definition of linear transformations.
Plus x2 two times the transformation of e2 plus all the way to xn times the transformation of en.
"Now, what is this?"
"I could rewrite this, so everything I've done so far, so the transformation of x is equal to that, which just using our properties of linear transformations, all linear transformations, this has to be true for them."
I get to this and this is equivalent.
"This is equal to-- if we view each of these as a column vector, this is equal to what?"
"This is equal to the matrix where this is the first column, T e1."
And then the second column is T e2.
"And then we go all the way to T en times-- let me put it this way-- x1, x2, all the way to xn."
"We've seen this multiple, multiple times."
"Now what's really, really, really neat about this is I just started with an arbitrary transformation."
"And I just showed that an arbitrary linear transformation of x can be rewritten as a product of a matrix where I'm taking that same linear transformation of each of our standard basis vectors, and I can construct that matrix, and multiplying that matrix times my x vector is the same thing as this transformation."
So this is essentially showing you that all transformations--
let me be careful.
All linear transformations can be a matrix vector product.
"Not only did I show you that you can do it, but it's actually a fairly straightforward thing to do."
This is actually a pretty simple operation to do.
Let me show you an example.
"I don't know, I think this is super neat."
Let's say that I just-- I'm just going to make up some transformation.
Let's say I have a transformation and it's a mapping between-- let's make it extra interesting-- between R2 and R3.
"And let's say my transformation, let's say that"
"T of x1 x2 is equal to-- let's say the first entry is x1 plus 3x2, the second entry is 5x2 minus x1, and let's say the third entry is 4x1 plus x2."
This is a mapping.
I could have written it like this.
"I could write T of any vector in R2, x1, x2, is equal to-- and maybe this is just redundant, but I think you get the idea."
"I like this notation better. x1 plus 3x2, 5x2 minus x1, and then 4x1 plus x2."
This statement and this statement I just wrote are equivalent.
And I like to visualize this a little bit more.
"Now, I just told you that I can represent this transformation as a matrix vector product."
How do I do it?
But I like to do it because I think it'll give you the intuition on what's going on when we take our surface integrals.
"So I'm going to say that this whole thing right here, that that is equal to r of s plus the differential of s-- a super small change in s-- t minus r of s and t, all of that over that same super small change in s."
So hopefully you understand at least why I view things this way.
"When I take the limit as delta s approaches 0, these delta s's are going to get super duper duper small."
"And in my head, that's how I imagine differentials."
When someone writes the derivative of y with respect to x-- and let's say that they say that that is 2-- and we've done a little bit of math with differentials before.
"You can imagine multiplying both sides by dx, and you could get dy is equal to 2dx."
We've done this throughout calculus.
"The way I imagine it is super small change in y-- infinitely small change in y-- is equal to 2 times-- though, you can imagine an equally small change in x."
"So it's a-- well, if you have a super small change in x, your change in y is going to be still super small, but it's going to be 2 times that."
I guess that's the best way to view it.
"But in general, I view differentials as super small changes in a variable."
"So with that out of the way, and me explaining to you that many mathematicians would cringe at what I just wrote, hopefully this gives you a little-- this isn't like some crazy thing I did."
"I'm just saying, oh, delta s as delta approaches 0, I kind of imagine that as ds."
"And the whole reason I did that, is if you take this side and that side, and multiply both sides times this differential ds, then what happens?"
"The left hand side, you get the partial of r with respect to s is equal to this times ds."
I'll do ds in maybe pink.
"Times ds-- this is just a regular differential, super small change in s."
"This is a kind of a partial, with respect to s."
"That's going to be equal to-- well, if you multiply this side of the equation times ds, this guy's going to disappear."
"So it's going to be r of s, plus our super small change in s, t minus r of s and t."
Now let me put a little square around this.
This is going to be valuable for us in the next video.
We're going to actually think about what this means and how to visualize this on a surface.
"As you can imagine, this is a vector right here."
You have 2 vector valued functions and you're taking the difference.
And we're going to visualize it in the next video.
It's going to really help us with surface integrals.
"By the same exact logic, we can do everything we did here with s, we can do it with t, as well."
"So we can define the partial-- I'll draw a little-- I can define the partial of r with respect-- let me do it in a different color, completely different color."
It's orange.
The partial of r with respect to t-- the definition is just right here.
"So if a naive user, a naive human, is not from Canada, he might not know how to spell Scatchwood."
"If a person is not know from New York, he might not know how to pronounce ""Schenectady, New York"""
And I'm not really sure I'm pronouncing it right either.
(audience chuckles) but this edge really makes the difference.
"So, why is that a problem for us?"
Humans regain the wake.
Franz just mentioned that the human evaluations switch volumes in translation.
It's the same thing in speech recognition.
"The ground truth, the standard, the golden rule- the golden standard for speech recognition is human performance."
We have humans transcribing these speech recognition and that's what we benchmark ourselves against.
"And if the benchmark is barely better than the actual system, then we really have a problem."
"The other issue is that, with the kind of growth that we've seen in terms of usage, we are getting a ton of data flowing throughout the system."
Everyday we get about 2 years worth of data.
You can't even start thinking about transcribing all that.
We also have to support 27 languages.
"Internationalization is a big, big empahsis for us and we're trying to expand in all the languages of the world."
"So, I'm joking here but we're sort of-"
Fred Jilinek is a very famous person in speech recognition.
"He used to say that every time he fired a linguist, the performance rate improved."
(audience chuckles)
I want to fire all the humans.
"So, the key insight for us has been- speech recognition as I said is two different components and those two components try to, sort of, compensate for the deficiencies of each other."
So the acoustic model can compensate for the deficiency of the language model and vice versa.
"The traditional way of doing it is that you have the Truth that's set by a human transcriber, that's the gold standard."
And you benchmark your system against the truth.
You compare your best system against the truth and you try to PUSH it. and learn towards that goal.
"If you remove the truth, you are out of luck."
You don't have anything that you can compare against.
"The trick here for us is that we can actually cheat, and we can artificially make it harder for some parts of our system to function."
We can actually weaken parts of our system.
"So for example, if I weaken my language model then I suddenly have a system that's actually. . ."
less powerful and I can compare against the best system.
This occurred there.
"Because it knows who I am, it knows what I care about and it knows roughly where I am."
"So this notion of autonomous search, the ability to tell me things that I didn't know but I probably am very interested in, is the next great stage in my view of search."
"And ultimately, we think we can understand things like what you really meant."
"So, for example, you ask the question, ""What's the weather like?"" That's the question."
"And what you're really asking is, ""Do I wear a raincoat?"" Right?"
"Or, ""Do I water the plants?"""
"We think we can make that bridge or get closer to it, to understand, ""What did you really mean?"
"What is the problem you're really trying to solve?"" We've also thought a lot about new areas in commerce, specialize searches of one kind and another."
We brought a company called ITA around travel.
"So we're very, very interested in making it possible to answer very deep questions using Computer Science about things that you care about."
"It's interesting that--that one in three queries from smartphones is now from about where I am, where my location is, something around me."
"So, we know that users are doing this and we know they're doing it a lot and it makes sense to them."
"So, the area of mobile--it's interesting that our most mobile search traffic grew 50% in the first half of 2010."
It's growing much quicker than everything else.
"So, not only is--do I believe my strategy is correct here, but also the data says that our users really, really like this."
"It's interesting that Android and I, of course, I hope everybody has their Android phones with them."
"Android is shipping about 200,000 activations per day now, and God knows what the growth rate is going to be."
It's so fast.
"What's interesting about Android, of course, is it's not just one partner."
"There are more than 60 devices and 21 OEM partners across 59 carriers in 49 countries, and that number is growing very, very quickly."
"And you can imagine those numbers will be much, much greater before Christmas because of all the new products that are coming out."
"Search traffic from the Android phones tripled in the first half of 2010, another example of all us taking on."
Another part of this is a browser strategy.
Everybody here knows what browsers are; the things that you use when you are using the Internet?
We have a browser which we like a lot called Chrome.
It's based on an underlying technology called
"WebKit, which is very much the fastest underlying browser technology."
It's used by many of the browsers now and that's part of why it's so quick.
"And in Chrome's case, it's getting--it's got a huge momentum; it now has more than 70 million users."
"It's--the latest release is four times faster, that are really four times faster than the release we did two years ago."
And deeper integration with the browser means that we can have more autonomous actions.
"Whenever we're going to do an experiment with two sources which are in phase, at the same frequency, you can predict the directions of maxima and minima and you can even predict the separation, the linear separation, if you know how far away you are from these sources."
And the first demonstration that I'm going to do is with sound.
We have here two loudspeakers.
"And the distance between those two loudspeakers, we're going to do it with sound, D, is 1.5 meters."
That's a given.
And the frequency is 3000 hertz.
"The wavelength, therefore,"
"lambda, equals V divided by the frequency, the speed of sound is about 340 meters per second, divided by 3000, is about 0.113 meters."
So the wavelength is about 11.3 centimeters.
"I can now calculate everyone who is sitting here [fweet] right in the middle through this whole plane will have a maximum of sound, and then when we go away at angle theta, some will again have maxima, and we go further away theta, again maxima, and in between will be the minima."
And I'm going to calculate where they fall in the lecture hall.
The first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to give you N as in Nancy and calculate that angle theta of N and I will do it for the maxima.
"In other words, I'm going to use constructive interference and you see there, the sine of theta N is lambda divided by D. That's the equation I use."
When N is 0 the angle is 0.
That is 0 angle.
Everyone here will hear a maximum.
"When N is 1, and you may want to check that at home, I find an angle of 4.3 degrees, and when N is 2, the angle is about double that, is about 8.7 degrees, and when N is 3, it should be close to 13 degrees, 13.1."
"In case you take N is 10, so I skip a few, you get about 49 degrees."
This is where the maximum fall.
And so there's going to be a maximum here and then 4.3 degrees away is again a maximum.
But surely we would like to know how far you in the audience will have to move in order to go from a maximum to a minimum.
"And so the way you have to think of this is that if I make here a picture of the lecture hall, if here are these two sources, you are at a distance L away from here."
Some of you are 5 meters away.
Some are 10 meters away.
"Some are 15 meters away, all the way in the back of the audience."
And you want to know where you're going to hear the maxima.
"I call this X1,"
"I call this X2, and I call this X3, and this is 0."
So this is the meaning of theta 1.
"And this is the meaning of theta 3, and this angle here would be theta 2."
That's the meaning of these angles.
"And so I can calculate now how far you have to move depending upon what capital L is to hear, to go from one maximum in sound to another maximum."
[music].
So let's get going today.
And what we were talking about
"last time is the discovery that the atom was not the most basic constituent of matter, that there was a particle that was even less massive than an atom."
And that is the electron.
"But today, we're going to discover the nucleus."
And so this is 1911.
And this is Ernest Rutherford in England.
And what he was interested in doing was studying the emission from these newly radioactive elements that were being discovered.
"So the emission from radium, for example."
What he did was he got a sample of radium bromide from his friend Marie Curie.
And what was known was that this radium bromide emitted something called alpha particles.
And the exact nature of these alpha particles was not known.
"However, what was known was that they were heavy particles, that they were charged and that they were energetic."
"And, of course, today we know what these alpha particles are."
"They are helium double plus, a helium with two electrons removed."
All right.
So he got this radium bromide.
And alpha particles are being emitted from the radium bromide.
"And he had some kind of detector way out here, which detected these alpha particles."
"And what he found was that at the detector there were about 132,000 alpha particles per minute."
That was the count rate that he was able to measure.
"And then, because he was just trying to figure out what is the nature of these particles, he did this experiment."
"He took a gold foil, a really thin gold foil here, really thin meaning 2^10-5 inches."
That's two orders of magnitude thinner than the diameter of your hair.
I've always wondered how he handled that.
That is pretty thin.
But he put that in there.
"And lo and behold, the count rate that he measured once this gold foil was in place, the count rate was still 132,000 alpha particles per minute."
It appeared that all of the alpha particles that were being emitted just went through the foil right to the detector.
It didn't even seem like those alpha particles knew the foil was there.
"We were desperate, so we rushed out to the Blaskets as soon as we heard there were sharks there, and managed to find some sharks."
So by just rubbing the mop handle down the shark as it swam under the boat -- you see a shark running under the boat here -- we managed to collect slime.
And here it is.
Look at that lovely black shark slime.
"And in about half an hour, we got five samples."
Five individual sharks were sampled using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System.
(Laughter) (Applause)
"I've been working on whales and dolphins in Ireland for 20 years now, and they're a bit more dramatic."
You probably saw the humpback whale footage we got a month or two ago off County Wexford.
"And you always think you might have some legacy you can leave the world behind, and I was thinking of humpback whales breaching and dolphins."
But hey -- sometimes these things are sent to you and you just have to take them when they come.
So this is possibly going to be my legacy --
Simon's Shark Slime.
We got more money this year to carry on collecting more and more samples.
"One thing that is very useful is that we use a pole camera -- this is my colleague, Joanne, with a pole camera -- where you can look underneath the shark."
"What you're trying to look at is, the males have claspers, which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark."
So you can quite easily tell the gender of the shark.
"If we can tell the gender of the shark before we sample it, we can tell the geneticist this was taken from a male or a female."
"Because in the moment, they have no way, genetically, of telling the difference between a male and a female, which I find staggering, because they don't know what primers to look for."
"Being able to tell the gender of a shark is very important for things like policing the trade in basking shark and other species through the sightings, because it is illegal to trade in these sharks."
And they are caught and are on the market.
"So as a field biologist, you just want to get encounters with these animals, and learn as much as you can."
"They're often quite brief, they're often very seasonally constrained."
You just want to learn as much as you can as soon as you can.
"But isn't it fantastic that you can then offer these samples and opportunities to other disciplines, such as the geneticists, who can gain so much more from that."
"So as I said, these things are sent to you in strange ways."
Grab them while you can.
I'll take that as my scientific legacy.
"Hopefully, I might get something a bit more dramatic and romantic before I die."
"But for the time being, thank you for that."
And keep an eye out for sharks.
"If you're more interested, we have a basking shark website now set up."
"So, I'm really good at taking notes on this; I am terrible at editing."
And it just means if I really wanted to become good at actually...
"If I had to do final papers or let's say documents for my boss or something on this device, I would really have to practice using that before and after letter, ah, issue I was just talking about."
But it's really confusing if you're not used to it.
"Because sometimes you're before the letter, sometimes you're after, depending on the direction you've moved."
And I'm making a big deal of that because I don't want that to throw anyone or convince anyone not to do this.
"Ah, it's just something that if you practice with, it's fine."
"When I go to meetings, I just do a lot of writing."
And there's a thing in here where you can email the note to yourself.
"And you get all the text, errors included, and that works out great."
"There's actually, If I can input here, there's actually a very good article on macaccessibility.net and that's www.macaccessbility.net, under the tutorials section that describes the cursor and how the cursor in mac or ios differs from the cursor in Windows."
"Uh, it describes it really well."
"That's what I read when I started using the ios devices cuz it got, it got me confused too."
"I'm like 'Wait a minute,'"
"'I didn't want to delete that character, I wanted to delete the one to the left.'"
"Then I read that article and now I realize that the cursor is different between the two operating systems, and so it's ah..."
I still make mistakes myself.
It takes a bit of getting used to.
I have done editing on here.
"But yeah, it's, It's definitely different than Windows."
[new speaker]
"And it's actually kind of neat because it's much more precise, but if you're not used to it it can really throw you."
And I don't want to waste everyone's time.
"If I were home, I'd spend the next ten minutes making this pristine just for the challenge, but I'm not going to waste everybody's time and do that."
[Audience member]
Thank you.
"Um..There's a lot of different places throughout the iPhone that you can actually go into edit mode, you'd like to be able to go into edit mode, like in the search fields, and um, and ah, text messaging, and things like that."
"Does this keyboard, this edit mode, work in every single one of the iPhone apps?"
Or does it only work in the notes?
"Um, the keyboard will work in any of the edit fields."
That's the nice thing about all of the ios devices.
"If you have an edit field in texting, or whether it's in notes, or Navigon, or any field, or any application, this keyboard's going to work with it. cuz an edit box is an edit box. and if the developer has-- [sudden library announcement over PA system]"
So the buildings will vary depending on the interests of the occupant.
"Other than that, there would be a very wide selection of what buildings people can live in."
"All the lines are curved, which makes the building much stronger."
And the boats and helicopter is there for your use.
In the future i don't think people will want to own anything anymore.
Everything is there for their use.
But you don't own anything.
You live in a building as long as you like.
You can travel any place you want to travel.
"And then if you come over here, this may be a model of an art center in the future, where artist materials, you have access to any material you want."
There is no fee anymore.
And so what you see here is different buildings and different mechanisms that serve a different purpose.
This represents a joint venture of all the world's people going out into space together and using it for the benefit of everyone.
"Now, if you come over here, you will see these are exhibition buildings."
Some of them we built for China originally.
And this represents a rooftop landing area.
And the rooftop gardens will be on all buildings in the future.
All of the larger buildings will have a rooftop gardens or solar generators as part of the roof.
"Jacque Fresco sees all repetitive tasks being performed by automated machinery in the future, enabling people to have more free time to explore their areas of interest and help advance society."
This is a way we produce buildings in the future.
This is a machine that has a die placed in this area and then it squeezes the buildings out like that.
And then a laser beam cuts them.
And this machine picks the building off and transfers it to this machine.
"And this machine, if i can change my position, if you can see this, this machine shoves the building onto that ramp."
It shoves on like that.
"And once it gets there, the memory metals lock and keep it in place."
"The buildings will be put up in dry dock, that means like ships are built."
Then a machine that looks like this will travel along putting in the windows and everything.
"And then when the buildings are finished, say you have got like 10 buildings finished in here, then we flood it with water and the buildings are built on a float, and we float the building to the location."
Then we use water jets under the building.
So we slip the building in place like that.
"Instead of bringing building material out there and cut it up and make it, we make them all in dry dock and we move them on water, because with water you can move heavy freight and it doesn't have to be fast."
(Gravelly)Not if Swagron has anything to say about it!
"(Electronically) No way, man."
Swagizo has got this one!
(insecurely) Polly-swag. . .
"(chuckles) Yeah, I think we ran that one into the ground."
Thanks Franz.
My name is Vincent Vanhoucke.
I work on the speech technology team here at Google and I thought I'd try to share with you a single piece of insight that we gain from working on speech technology at Google Scad.
"And that can be summarized basically as such and if you want to get a shot at super-human performance of machinery, maybe the first thing you should try and do is get rid of the humans."
(audience chuckles)
"So, you might be questioning my premise already."
"You might be wondering, ""[He's] talking about super-human speech recognition here."
"And we all know that speech recognition is not at human performance yet."""
The problem is that it's getting dangerously close.
Let me just give you an example.
Imagine- so one of the products is voice search so you can just speak to the search engine and we'll look for it.
You can just talk to it.
"So imagine you can just talk to your phone, you can record that prompt and then we play it back either to yourself or we'll play it back to the speech recognition engine we find in research, okay?"
And we ask for the transcription.
There is no question at this point that you will do a much better job than the speech recognition engine at recognizing your own speech.
The picture changes when if you actually change this up and play the audio to a naive human.
"By naive human, I mean someone who doesn't know you, who doesn't necessarily have the same cultural references as you have, who doesn't necessarily live in the same neighborhood, who doesn't have the same context, then, it actually becomes a toss-up."
If you just play it once to a user and ask them to transcribe it and they will do almost no better than speech recognition.
"So, why is that?"
"Roughly, without going into details, speech recognition is too complex."
There's an acoustic model and an English model.
The acoustic model is what recognizes the sounds and we're not really at human performance yet in acoustic modeling.
"In fact, the fidelity is not yet at the level of a native human speaker."
"But we have this language model, and the language model is what predicts what words you are saying and which order you you are going to say."
"We train similar to machine translation, huge!"
On huge corpuses
We train on 240 billion words for voice search and that gives us an edge that a single user might not have.
"Part of this process is to help people understand that this is possible, and create a demand for it."
"And if there's a demand, then people will take this information and start producing the product, which doesn't exist for the large part for many people."
"Believe me, people ask me, how fast could a transition be made?"
You know what?
In two years this could become the dominant agricultural paradigm.
"All it takes is for Americans to say, this is what I want."
"Because, believe me, there are thousands of small farmers around this country poised, able and ready to scale up."
"But they're not good marketers, they're whatever."
"We're going to talk about that later, some of the really exciting developments that you've encountered, within your local community, is the adoption of internet technology and social networking to allow that transition to occur, to easily sell the product."
"Yes, that's what we're needing to have, is aggregators, that crucial aggregator marketer."
"As I see it, the technology is here, the land is here, the knowledge is here, we just need people that are willing to say, you know what?"
I don't need that Caribbean cruise this year.
I'll take that thousand dollars and I'll buy better food.
And maybe I'll feel better.
"That's what we need, we need people to make that life adjustment, and as that happens it's going to be a good thing."
This is the only herd that we have right now that isn't being mob stocked.
"Because here we just made hay, and we've got all this poultry, so we're trying to just clean a little bit ahead of these, so they're in a pretty big paddock."
The paddock goes from the turkeys over here.
"We're just trying to clean up around the fringes, where the mower couldn't get."
But you get a sense of it.
Some of the grass finished beef here.
"This is what we call ""salad bar beef""."
"Everyday they get a new paddock, yesterday they were over there, today they're here, this afternoon they'll move into that next paddock right there."
"What we're doing here is we're just kind of cleaning up after we made hay, to kind of clean the fringes of the field where the mower couldn't get, and that sort of thing."
"These are grass finished beef, as opposed to grain, and grass-fed, that used to mean the same thing, and now it's become a distinction."
"Kind of like the term ""natural""."
It's been perverted and bastardized.
"Exactly, exactly."
"Grass-fed, the fact is that all cows in the US are grass-fed at some point in their lives."
And then they go into a feedlot for four months.
And it only takes 14 days of grain feeding to chase most of the conjugated linoleic acid out of the body of a ruminant.
"Two weeks and they're at it for four months, in the typical factory farm."
I'm just writing V1 here.
We do the reconfig with this member down.
"So now, these guys are on two."
"This one still has one, though, so when it comes back up, and it's trying to recover, it has an old version of the config."
"So it will communicate with the other servers, see that they have newer versions of the config, and grab that version from them."
"Then it will go into a recovery state, pulling data, rolling back, whatever it needs to do, and then eventually, it'll be back into that state and have the new configuration."
So that's fine.
"So in general, our config object is ID, set name, members, and each member of the set has a series of fields, ID."
"However, we can add some extra options to give the system some extra instructions."
"So what we can do is after this host name here, we can then have some options."
So let's talk about what these options can be.
"So, one of the most common options to use is arbiter, and it's actually called arbiterOnly."
"If you specify that, it indicates that the member of the set is what we call an arbiter, in MongoDB terminology."
It means the number has no data whatsoever.
"If we have a set, we might have a primary, a secondary, and an arbiter."
"So there will be replication here, these servers have data and no data."
"However, the arbiter does get to participate in elections, because the challenge without the arbiter in a situation"
"like this, with only two members, is how do you tiebreak on elections if they both want to vote for themselves?"
But consider a case like the following.
"You have a member here, a member here, and these are members of a set, and they're going to talk to each other, and they're trying to do an election."
They're trying to get a consensus on who should be primary.
"They both just booted up, let's say."
The problem is if the network is down.
"So this is our server one, server two, and then we have clients out here, client."
"And imagine we have a network here, and maybe we have some switches."
It's all in one data center in this example.
"Now we have a problem, though, which is this link is broken."
"Well if this server is up-- the mongod process is running on here, yet it's unable to connect to the rest of the world."
"This server is up, its mongod process is running."
It's able to connect to the rest of the world.
"So the question is then, who should be primary?"
"And it seems kind of clear that this one should, obviously and intuitively."
What about the people who eat it in their fish?
What are the public health costs?
"You know, all these costs."
"I mean, we're talking millions and millions and millions of dollars."
"So you want to make waste management, or you want to do waste reduction?"
"Which one is more cost efficient, cost effective?"
"For a government that's struggling, that can't even provide water to the residents in"
"Denpasar, there are so many other crises that are impending on this island, you know, plastic should be the easiest thing."
"Just put a bag tax, and then when people already realize, there's already public support, ""hey, bags are expensive,"" then you do a bag ban."
Ban it.
Ban the single use plastic bag.
Ireland?
92% reduction in 2 weeks!!!
"They just banned it outright, and it's possible in a place like Bali: it's an island."
You could just ban the bag.
And people would just have to learn to deal with it.
You learn.
"The first or second time you go to the store and you don't have a bag, and you're either forced to buy a bag or you've got to go home and get one, you won't forget again."
"You know, instant behavior shift."
Instant.
"And people will grumble, and [complain], but grow up!"
"We have to be adults about the environment we live in. / Students are the next leaders to come in the very near future, so they need to be able to have access to the kind of information and education to be made aware."
"And often times, not just in Indonesia, but in many countries, the school curriculum is outdated."
"It's not relevant to the current issues that we're facing in modern times, so to be able to infuse the perhaps outdated or ""has-room-to-grow"" curriculum, we feel that would be really effective, and get the kids excited."
"We started to select schools in different areas, many of them were in a little bit more remote areas, where they didn't really have any collection service, so typically the school would be burning the waste, or throwing it in the river at the back."
"We had very good discussions in a high school, in which, without wanting to say what was the solution, we were asking,"
"""What do you think should be done, what can you do to reduce waste in your daily situation?"""
"And without having to say anything, because we had refreshments around that were served by the school, students went straight away,"
"""This can take away, this we can reintroduce the banana leaf, don't use that and that."""
"So, I think actually the high schools should be a pretty good target. / A lot of programs, they don't need a lot of money, but they need some."
"And if you could help in the fundraising efforts for getting these programs off the ground or sustaining them, it would be a huge, huge help."
"When you think about it on that global scale, what will future communities do?"
"That is, this is going to be cut off point for A. This would be."
"B, and then this for, C, and, then, right here, for, D, and here for E. we can ask how much is, how much is A gonna incur in pollution abatement to clean up these first four units, cuz it's not, it's gonna buy one right, so that's 100 plus."
"200, 600, so that's three, six, $1500."
I hope I have that right.
"Let's try again, 300, yes, 1500."
"B is going to clean up these first two units, which is going to be equal to $800."
"And C is going to include all of these which is $600, $1200, that is $3000, that C is going to incur in clean up costs."
D is going to clean up the first three which is $3000 again.
"And E is when clean up only one unit or incur cost equal to $1,000.00."
Each of these firms is going to incur from setting standards and selling rights.
And A incurred $700 as we indicated earlier. with setting a standard.
"If we add this total up we're going to come up with $13,500 in total costs."
Now if we sell rights.
"These five figures here are going to total 9,300."
"It is actually cheaper to, to, to achieve the, pollution goal through the auctioning of rights and by setting standards."
"And the reason is that the people who buy the rights are, are going to be the high-cost polluters."
The people who are gonna be forced out of buying those rights are going to be the low-cost producers of pollution abatement.
"As a result, what we're going to do is achieve environmental. quality improvement by a la-, by encouraging the low-cost pollution abaters to do the pollution abatement."
"Now, the interesting issue is this, who would favor which."
"The method, the standard or the selling of rights."
"Well firm A incurs a cost of $700 here, $1.500 in selling rights issue."
You can imagine that even without considering the cost of the one ticket that firm A buys that firm
A. Will vote for the standard.
"And it's total cost over here is going to be $3,000, because 1,500 in abatement costs plus 1,500 for the standard."
"Firm B, well, it looks like the standard is, is going to be more costly than the pollution right."
"But notice that Firm B has to buy three pollution rights, that's 4,500 or 5,300, so B is going to favor the setting of the standards."
"C Well, right off the bat, this is going to be cheaper for Firm C. D has equal costs inclusion and in both cases, but C/D is going to have to buy two pollution rights which makesthis total over here $6000."
So we get D voting for the setting of the standards and firm E
"looks like it's a clear winner for the selling of freights, but notice that firm"
"E is gonna have to pay 1500 for each of four pollution rights, which means it's total cost of the year is gonna be 7000 dollars, which means that firm D. Is going to, is going to be a winner and in fact it will get the unanimous vote."
"What's really very interesting is that the selling of, of pollution rights is actually less costly in terms of resource use."
But the politics of pollution abatement favor the setting of the standard.
A little bit of code on this side.
[Inaudible].
Okay.
Pop empty cell.
I've got that.
"Oh,"
"I think I may have proved, oh, it deliberately makes the error, in fact."
That it was designed to test on that.
[Inaudible] up to the end.
"So let's see if we get back a three, two, one out of this guy."
Okay.
So we manage to do okay even on that.
"So looking at this piece of code, all right, the two operations we're most interested in, push and pop, right, are each oh of one, right."
"The number of elements out there, right, aren't changing anything about its performance."
"It does a little bit of imagination and a little bit of pointer arrangement up here to the front to the end and so it has a very nice tight allocation strategy, too, which is appealing relative to what the vector-based strategy was doing."
"It's like, now, it's doing things in advance on our behalf like extending our capacity so that every now and then we had some"
"little glitch right when you were doing that big resize operation that happened infrequently, you won't have that same concern with this one because it does exactly what it needs at any given time, which is allocate a single cell, deletes a single cell, and also keeping the allocation very tidy in that way."
So they'll both end of being oh of one.
And both of these are commonly used viable strategies for how a stack is implemented.
Right.
"Depending on the, you know, just the inclination of the program or they may have decided one way was the way to go versus another that you will see both used in common practice because there really isn't one of them that's obviously better or obviously worse, right."
"Now, this uses a little bit more memory per cell, but then you have excess capacity and vector has excess capacity but no overhead per cell."
There's a few other things to kind of think about trading off.
"You say, well, the code, itself, is a little harder to write if you're using only [inaudible]."
"That means it's a little bit more error prone and more likely, you'll make a mistake and have to do debug your way through it and the way with the vector it was pretty easy to get without tearing out your hair."
"Now, if we can do stack and queue that fast -"
"I mean, stack that fast, then you figure queue must be not so crazy either."
Let me draw you a picture of queue.
Okay.
I've got my queue and I can use the
"End queue operation on it to put in a 10, to put in a 20, to put in a 30."
And
Right.
"You're spending more money, time, resources and pension on asset C than it's, that you probably need to in order to comply with management's directive with, with, and with policy."
"When you're doing the base line approach, it's two steps."
The first step is to establish this minimum set of controls.
"And, you would select controls using, using standards and, you know, Barbara I know has talked to you about a number of standards and you're probably aware of other sets of standards."
"I mean, there are no shortage of standards out there. and then, you would make the security check"
list.
"And then, step two is you would analyze the gaps and you'd do that using the checklist."
"And then, when there's a gap, you'd do whatever you need to do in terms of remediation to either close that gap or to reduce the expenditures in areas where your level of control is higher than what's specified by the analysis."

"(Ken Robinson) Every country on Earth, at the moment, is reforming public education."
There are two reasons for it.
The first of them is economic.
People are trying to work out how do we educate our children to take their place in the economies of the 21st century?
How do we do that?
"Even though we can't anticipate what the economy will look like  at the end of next week, as the recent turmoil is demonstrating."
How do we do that?
"The second, though, is cultural."
"Every country on Earth, on earth is trying to figure out how do we educate our children so they have a sense of cultural identity, and so that we can pass on the cultural genes of our communities, while being part of the process of globalization?"
How do we square that circle?
The problem is they're trying to meet the future by doing what they did in the past.
"And on the way, they're alienating millions of kids who don't see any purpose in going to school."
"When we went to school, we were kept there with a story, which is, if you worked hard and did well and got a college degree,  you would have a job."
Our kids don't believe that.
"And they're right not to, by the way."
"You're better having a degree than not, but it's not a guarantee anymore."
And particularly not if the route to it marginalizes most of the things that you think are important about yourself.
"Some people say we have to raise standards, as if this is a breakthrough."
"You know, like, really, yes we should."
Why would you lower them?
[laughter]
I haven't come across an argument that persuades me of lowering them.
We got from here that the source of the paradox is the simultaneity issue in the Garage's frame.
Indeed the ladder is contained in the garage.
In the
"ladder's frame, this never happens and the reason is that simultaneity is relative, and because the ladder is moving, the relativity of simultaneity means that at the same time, that say, the left hand entered the garage, in the ladder's frame the right hand was already out, okay?"
"So, what's our graphic representation?"
"Well here's our graphic representation, this is already familiar."
"I was here careful to remind myself that I'm plotting CT, so the red line that goes off at 45 degrees is the world line of a light beam."
"You don't need a light beam here, but it helps me to draw the t prime, CT prime and x prime axis so that the light cone bisects them."
"And what I have here, these two black lines to represent the garage These two blue lines represent the world lines."
X prime equal to zero is the T prime axis.
And x prime equals to L is the bold line of the right side of the garage and so this point here is X prime equal to L and.
"Both sides of the garage are moving, of the ladder are moving."
Both sides of the garage are stationary.
"I may have called the ladder a garage, but hopefully you understand what I am saying by now, and you're used to my ambiguity."
A word on scales in these diag rams and a very important point.
"So, suppose that I were to draw a grid of lines so these are lines of constant t, these are lines of constant x and some units so these are, and, and"
I've picked the unit so they are compatible.
"In other words, that if in some units this is one, two, three, four so my garage in this case is precisely four units long."
"Then CT is also one, two, three, four and you can see that because these, these things intersect the 45 degree."
Light count.
And so I've drawn these.
"How do I draw the point, t prime = to one?"
Where along the t prime axis is t prime = to one? and one way to think about it.
"One, naive way, is to just measure this same length along this axis."
"And because it is, The axis is, is, not vertical."
That would lead you to some point.
Around here and you'd maybe try to set that as t prime equals the one and that would be incorrect.
"The point is that the distance along this axis, in general, distances in this 2-dimensional plot are completely meaningless. well, how do you measure distances?"
"Well, the distance is this, between any two points."
"Is the square root of the difference in x squared, the horizontal difference, plus the vertical difference squared."
"That's, the Pythagorean Theorem which applies very well to the Euclidean surface of this A tablet upon which I am drawing it or to this Euclidean surface of this slide, but this is not a physical quantity."
"In particular, there is no reason why it isn't all related to x prime squared plus c^2 t prime squared."
"That means the quantity of tickets available is going to be ten, the quantity of Tickets or pollution rights demanded is going to be 25, there is a serious shortage in the market and in an auction that shortage is going to be solved by an elevation of the rights."
If the price of one of these tickets goes to $150 then you can imagine that A. will only buy four rights.
Why?
"Because A would prefer to incurr the $100 cost of abating the first unit of pollution than to pay, to pay $150 for a right to pol-."
To pollute or to emit that unit of pollution.
"So, the price, the quantity demanded of tickets is going to go down."
"As, the price at the auction goes up."
"As in all markets, there is going to be an equilibrium price for, these pollution rights."
"In thi s market on my document camera, we have the supply of pollution rights."
This vertical
line here.
There are ten of them.
Got it indicated there.
This demand curve is actually drawn from the earlier table.
"That is, I just, if the price goes up, I just ask how many. tickets would firms a, b, c, d and e, buy, and this is actually how it turns out."
"That is, as the price of the ticket goes up, the number of tickets demanded, goes, goes down, goes down to zero at $5600."
"Well, the equilibrium price."
Is going to be the intersection price and supply demand intersect at 1500 dollars.
Now suppose that the government decides to auction off these rights and the equilibrium price is 1500 dollars as we've indicated from our graphical analysis and then we ask the issue how many. tickets or pollution rights with each of these firms obey.
While A would prefer to clean up the first unit of pollution at a cost of a $100 and had to go by a pollution right and would enable it to avoid clean up.
"It would prefer to but. clean up the second one and the third one and the fourth one, but it would prefer to buy a pollution right at 1500 than to incur $1600 in costs."
So A is going to buy one pollution right.
"B, on the other hand, would prefer to clean up these first two units, incur those costs as opposed to paying $1500 to avoid cleaning them up, so B Is going to want to buy, three pollution rights. c is going to want to buy none of, none of the pollution rights, and the reason is that it's cost of clean up is, is lower for each of these units, than the $1,500 ticket price, so c Is going to have zero tickets, quantity demanded."
"D, is going to want to buy two tickets."
Why?
"Because it is cheaper to buy a ticket for 1,500, than to incur a pollution cost, abatement cost of 1,800 or 2,200."
"So D is going to buy two rights, and E is going to buy four rights."
"The reason is, it will clean up the first unit at $1000 as opposed to paying $1500 to avoid cleaning it up."
"It is cheaper to buy the rights here, so we have a situation here in which A. Is when a by one right D three, C0, D2, and A4."
"Well, at the end those up one, three, four, six, ten."
Quantity demanded is equal to ten.
Now we know where the distribution is.
"The question would be well, ya why is it, why are these negative instance such a big deal."
Why can't we just reduce shortest path competition with negative edge links to the problem of computing shortest paths with non negative edge links.
Right so whatever just clear things out we just add big number to all the edges that makes them all non-negative and now we just run Dijkstra's algorithm and we're good to go.
"So this is exactly the sort of question you should be looking to ask, if, as a computer scientist, as a serious programmer."
When confronted with a problem you always want to look for ways to reduce it to simpler problems that you already know how to solve.
And this is a very natural idea of how to reduce a seemingly harder sort of path problem to one we already know how to solve using dutch [inaudible] algorithm.
The only problem is it doesn't quite work.
One isn't gonna work.
"Well if you, Let's say you have a graph, and the most negative edge is -ten."
So all the edge lengths are negative ten and above.
"So then what you'd want to do is add ten to every single edge in the network, and that insures that all of the edge lengths are non negative, run Dijkstra's algorithm, get your shortest path."
The is sue is that different.
Paths between a common origin and destination have differing numbers of edges.
"So some might have five edges, Some might have two edges."
Now if you add ten to every single edge in the graph you're going to change path lengths by different amounts.
"If a path has five edges, it's going to go up by 50, when you add ten to every edge."
"If a path has only two edges, It's only going to go up by twenty, when you add ten to every edge."
"So as soon as you start changing the path lengths of different paths by different amounts, you might actually screw up which path is the shortest."
The path which is shortest under the new edge lengths need not be the one that's shortest under the old edge
lengths.
So that's why this reduction doesn't work.
"To be concrete, let's look at this very simple three vertex graph with vertices s, v, and t and edge lengths as shown."
One minus five and minus two.
"Now what I hope is clear, is that in this graph."
The shortest path.
"The one with the minimum length is the two hot path Svt,"
That has length minus four.
The direct STR has length minus two which is bigger than minus four.
So the upper path is the shortest path.
"Now, suppose we tried to massage this by adding a constant to every edge so all edge lengths were non-negative."
We'd have to add five to every edge because that's the biggest negative number the VT edge.
So that would give us new edge lengths of six.
"So as product designers, we always have to be asking this question, what associations are people going to make from what they're looking at here?"
"Sometimes it seems absurd looking at a simple web form thinking, what associations are people going to make with this thing?"
What does this look like?
"So in these design processes, this is one exercise that we do, and I would highly recommend it."
It's not hard to get started.
"Just pull up a whole bunch of imagery and start sorting out on the table, start making these associations."
What should our product feel like?
What does our product feel like right now?
What do our competitors' products feel like?
What associations do we need to evoke in the minds of our users?
So now we're talking about how to make people care.
"There's one last idea I want to put out there, that one of the best ways to make people care about our products is to show people that we care about our products."
"Now, this is a reality about perception that's hard wired into our brains that sometimes very small things can make a really big difference in how we see something."
"Now, I don't know whether, if I download an app that has a poorly-executed app icon, whether it's going to be more flaky or whether it's going to crash on me."
I haven't necessarily seen the data with that correlation.
But I do know that that's the association that users are going to make based on millions of years of evolution.
"When you see something that's not quite the right color or that has a hole in the wrong place, you bite that fruit, you might be seeing the second half of a worm."
"So also, we need to do not miss the opportunities to do the things that we don't have to."
"Those little pieces of design in places where they're not needed, where they're uncalled for, tell the user that hey, a designer was here."
Somebody thought about this.
They're like little love notes for our users.
"It's the interactive doodle on the home page, or the mint on the pillow, what you put on the back of the box in the package."
It's the hidden extra level of the game.
"There's value in doing these things that don't have an apparent commercial purpose, where we're showing people that we care so they'll care enough to use our products."
"In this case, PacMan didn't help people to finish their searches faster."
"It probably actually got in the way for some people, me included."
"But people loved it, and why?"
Because we didn't have to do it.
It's like a note or flowers.
It's these intangibles that show people that we care.
"Here's another small example that comes from Google Now, where the Context Header changes based on your time of day or your location."
"And when we were making these, during the process people said, this is going to be hard."
"I'm just continuing this ultra, five star problem just so you make sure you can understand everything that's going on, especially with tension and pulleys and all the rest."
So here we were.
We figured out the net forces acting on this block.
And we said it was the tension of the rope minus the force of friction.
And we figured out the force of friction in the traditional way.
And that equals the mass of the block times the acceleration of the block.
"And actually, it would have been a good idea here to solve for tension."
So what is the tension pulling on this block?
The tension is equal to 10 times the acceleration of the block plus 39.2 newtons.
"And actually, this is probably the one that I should have squared because this is even more useful than what I wrote before."
So we figured out the tension of the rope here in terms of the acceleration of the block.
And then we moved on to the pulley.
"And we said, OK, well what are the net forces acting on here?"
"We have 150 newtons to the right, and we have twice the tension pulling back right?"
Cause we have the tension here pulling back and the tension there.
That's kind of what pulleys do.
And we knew that because the tension in the rope is constant.
"And if you were to do it here, not that it matters, the tension of the rope here is T and then the wall is pulling back on the rope with the force T."
And that's why this point is constant.
"But we don't worry about that, so back to the problem."
"So we said the net forces on the pulley, which is 150 minus 2 times the tension, is equal to the mass of the pulley, 5 kilograms, times the acceleration-- and this is the p here-- times the acceleration of the pulley."
"And at the very beginning of the problem I had said, well the acceleration of the pulley is half the acceleration of the block."
And I went off about all the reasons.
"And I'll say it one more time, because if this pulley moves an inch to the right, not only will the pulley move an inch to the right, this length of wire will get an inch longer, right, cause this is stationary here."
"So this length of wire, since the wire is a constant length, will get an inch shorter."
"So this is getting an inch shorter and the pulley is moving an inch to the right, so this block will move 2 inches to the right."
"So that's how we came to the conclusion that whatever the velocity to the right of this pulley is, the velocity of this block will be twice that."
"Or whatever the acceleration of this pulley is to the right, the acceleration of this block will be twice that."
And that's what we wrote here.
The acceleration of the pulley or the acceleration of the block is twice the acceleration of the pulley.
Or the acceleration of the pulley is 1/2 the acceleration of the block.
"So with that said, we took this equation and we substituted the acceleration of the pulley."
"Now the problem here is that you have this selling of pollution rights as, as less costly than the setting of the standards."
But yet the politics calls all five firms to vote for the setting of the standards and the issue becomes one of how do we.
Courage firms to vote for the cheaper method of beating pollution.
"Well, there is one possibility that you can get concurrence from the five firms."
To switch firm setting standard to selling the pollution rights.
"As opposed to just setting the standard for polluting two units, why don't we."
Tell these firms that we're going to give you two pollution rights.
And you can use these pollution rights or you can sell these pollution rights.
What we know from pour graphical analysis that the equilibrium price.
"Is going to be $1500 and that is established by the intersection of the supply of pollution rights and the demand for pollution rights and the demand for pollution rights as a function of these, of these call structures and these call s tructures have not changed."
So we know the equilibrium price is going to be $1500.
"When you give the rights to pollute to the firms and then allow them to resell, if they want to resell them, well what is going to happen?"
"Well at $1500 per pollution right A is going to figure, well"
"I would prefer To sell one of my tickets, collect the $1500, and incur the cost of $800 to clean up and I'll be better off to the tune of $1500."
I will keep one right so I wont' have to incur this $1600 in cost.
"So a is gonna sell off one, one right. b is going to, Say B is going to do what?"
"It's going to buy one right, why?"
"Because it want's to lower its cost of abatement by 1,800 at a cost of the ticket for uh,1,500."
"C is going to, is going to."
"Well, C is gonna sell both rights."
"Why, because it can collect $3,000 from the selling of it's pollution rights, and then incur $1,800 to abate the pollution."
D?
Well D is gonna hang on to it's rights.
And keep them so it won't have to incur these costs.
Well E Is going to buy the is going to buy two pollution rights.
The result is that you get the exact same distribution of rights if you give the firms the right to pollute and then allow them to resell them.
"You get the same distribution as we got when the government was selling the, The rights and if you don't believe it, go back and replay this video lecture and see that the distribution here is exactly the same."
"But we also have a distribution, have a, have a system here, that's likely to be an improvement. over the government auction, as least as far as the bi perms are concerned."
Because bi perms get the rights free of charge.
And they can either use those rights or they can sell them.
"And if they use them it's just like the standard method, but if they sell them they, they can collect the fifteen hundred dollar price for the ticket."
"So if a firm keeps the rights and uses "" em, it must be better of then, then selling "" em for fifteen hundred."
So 152.5 - we can't use that number.
"Instead, we have to convert this to mols, then we can plug it into the molarity equation."
"So to convert this amount in grams into mols, the first thing we have to start with is the molar mass of copper chloride."
"And so to find the molar mass of copper chloride, we have to find copper and chlorine on the periodic table and take a look at their atomic masses."
"So copper - there is 1 copper atom in copper chloride, so I'll take the molar mass of copper - 63.55, and then there are 2 of these chlorines in copper chloride - so I want to take 2 times the molar mass of chlorine, which is 35.44."
"When I add these together, I get 134.45 grams per 1 mol."
OK?
That's like the molar mass of it.
"Now, we're going to have to use this as a conversion factor to go between grams and mols."
Remember that when we have conversion factors like this we can always write them in two ways.
"We can write it like this, and we can flip it."
So we can say 1 mol for every 134.45 grams.
Both of these are ways to express the relationship between grams and mols for copper chloride.
"Now that I know how to go between grams and mols with this conversion factor,"
I can take 152.5 grams and I can multiply it by one of these two conversion factors.
I want to use the one that gets rid of grams from the top of the equation up here.
"Since gram's on the top, I'm going to choose this conversion factor with grams down here."
"So now grams cancels out, grams cancels out, I'm left with mols - and I'm going to do 152.5 times 1, divided by 134.45."
And that is going to give me 1.134 mols.
I'm rounding to 4 significant figures here because I have 1-2-3-4 significant figures and I don't worry about the 1 because it's part of the definition.
So now I know that I have 1.134 mols of CuCl2.
Now I can go ahead and calculate the molarity.
"So molarity is going to be mols of solute - 1.134 mols, divided by liters of solution, equals 2.25 liters, and I want to crank through that, rounding it to 3 significant figures, because I have 3 sig figs there - it's going to be 0.504 molar."
"As I said before, don't forget that what that means is that there are 0.504 mols of CuCl2 for every 1 liter of this solution that we're making here."
A solution has a volume of 375 mL and contains 42.5 grams of NaCl - sodium chloride.
What is its molarity?
"This is kind of a challenging question because there are two things we need to calculate molarity - mols of solute, and liters of solution."
We aren't given either of these two things in the problem.
"Instead of mols of solute, we're given grams of solute - sodium chloride is a solute."
So we can't use that right away.
We'll have to convert grams to mols.
"Then, instead of getting liters of solution, we get mL of solution."
"And, I just happened to have made a bean dip yesterday and I'm going to turn some of that dip into a sauce."
"So, when you start with the bean dip, you can do any type of dip - hummus or black bean."
What I made is actually is white bean dip with some Italian herbs and some nutritional yeast to make it taste a little bit cheesy.
"So, you get your bean dip, made to the consistency of a dip, and then if you want to make a sauce out of it, you just add more water."
I'll post this garlic herb sauce recipe over at healthyveganrecipes.net.
I'm going to make this into a sauce and I will show you how to that right now.
One awesome thing about unpacking is I got to find all of my kitchen stuff that I packed away last May that I have not seen since.
"So, that's been like 8 months of not having my kitchen stuff."
"One of the things that I love are these pyrex dishes, they're glass and can with a plastic lid, so I can put this right on the fridge, and I can keep my food in glass instead of plastic containers, which is awesome."
These are made by pyrex but I think there are other companies that do the same kind of thing.
"So, here's my white bean dip that I made yesterday, you can see its very dip-like consistency and all you need to do to make it a sauce is to add water."
"I'm just going to spoon out the amount that I want, and again, if you're looking for the recipe for this dip, just head over to healthyveganrecipes.net."
"This is going to be a lunch for us, so that should do it."
I've got that in a bowl and you can do this in a blender.
You can actually just do it to a sauce consistency first but I did a lot of beans.
"I cooked some dried beans and I end up with quite a lot, so I made the dip first and today I feel like a sauce, so here we go."
What I got in here are some Italian herbs.
You can choose from whichever herbs you like.
"I think I have basil, chives and oregano - I can't quite remember, and I got some nutritional yeast in here, which is always a nice addition to a sauce - it's this yellow-flaky-stuff."
"And for salt, I'm using something called herbamare."
"It's a mix of salt as well as some dried herbs and some kelp, which is awesome to add iodine as well as making this salty but reducing the actual sodium content."
"I want my sauce a little bit runny, and all I'm doing is just stirring this up with the water so you can see it's quite runny - it's actually a little bit too runny, so I'm just going to add another spoonful of the dip."
That's a nice thing to have some dip at hand.
You can use it for all kinds of different things.
"Phil and I use it for snacks all the time, its fantastic."
"So, that's something really good, take a little taste just to make sure that as you water it down, it doesn't"
lose the flavor.
That's really nice but I think I just add a little bit more nutritional yeast.
Nutritional yeast is another thing that I pulled out of my box of kitchen stuff that I'm so happy to find.
"So, that's ready to go."
"And then, what I'm going to do is I'm going to serve it over cauliflower - cauliflower is not so exciting most of the time."
This one has few little brown spots that I'm just going to thinly slice off here.
"Now let me be clear, we havent even defined the coordinate axes, we do not really know what angle we are looking at it from, this is only for visualization purposes."
"So this line right over here,"
I can draw will look something like this.
It would look something like that.
It sits on that white plane.
Let me do the same thing for this magenta line.
"The magenta line also contains the point (0,0,0) but it also contains the point (4,2,3)"
SO let me just draw it over here.
"SO, (4,2,3), so that's the magenta line."
"You wouldn't even see it if this was transparent, it would just keep going down like that."
"Now, I am gonna try to explain how I am gonna tackle this problem again."
"I am going to use vectors to find, that are implicitly defined by this blue line and this magenta line."
"I am gonna take a cross product of those two vectors to find a vector that is normal to this entire white plane and that vector has to sit in this perpendicular plane, and then I can use that vector and vector a to figure out a normal vector for this plane and then I will be able to figure out the equation of this plane."
So let me just do it.
So what's a vector?
What are the two vectors that sit in this white plane?
"Well the point (0,0,0) the position vector (0,0,0) and the position vector (4,2,3) is in this plane so the vector p = 4i + 2j + 3k is also in this white plane."
"I am really just subtracting this position vector from that position vector to get this position vector, which clearly sits in this plane."
"This vector starts from origin, goes to (4,2,3), this plane contains the origin is clearly sitting in this plane, and by that same logic, I can figure out a vector, actually the position vector itself that sits on this plane."
I will call that c= 3i + 4j +2k.
The fact that everything is at the origin kinda simplifies everything.
The position vectors themselves sit on the plane.
"If this wasnt sitting on the origin, we wouldn't have been able to do that."
We would have had to subtract between these two vectors or between two other points to actually get vectors on this plane.
"But with that out of the way, I could take the cross product of b and c and that will give us some vector that is perpendicular to both b and c which means it is perpendicular or it is normal to this entire white plane which means it must sit in this yellow plane."
"So I am gonna find a normal vector in the yellow plane, just like that."
Lets call that vector d.
"SO the cross product of b and c is just, this is how I remember it. the determinant, you take i, j, k, it has been discussed in a lot more depth in linear algebra. playlist."
The determinant of that.
"The next row is the determinant of vector b so it 4, 2 and 3."
"And then the next row is that of vector c, so it is 3,4 and 2 and so this is going to be equal to, let's think about that."
"So for i, cross out that column and that row."
Just take a look at these.
"Once we start doing pointers, right, there's just opportunities for error."
I feel kind of good about what I did here but I am going to just do a little bit of tracing to kind of confirm for myself that the most likely situations that get you in trouble with link list is you'll handle the mainstream case but somehow forget one of the edge cases.
"Such as, what if the list was totally empty or just had a single cell?"
Is there some special case handling that needs to be dealt with?
"So if I think about it in terms of the push case, you know, I might say, well, if there's an existing set of cells, so we're using Strategy B here, let me erase A so I know what I'm looking at, that its head is currently pointing to a set of cells, right, that my allocation of the new cell out here, right, assigning its value, assigning its next field to be where head points two, and then sending head to this new guy, it"
looks to be good.
If I also do that tracing on the - what if the list that we were looking at was just null to begin with.
So there were no cells in there.
This is the very first cell.
It isn't going to have any kind of trouble stumbling over this case.
"So I would allocate that new cell 40, assign its value."
"Set the next field to be what head is, so that just basically sets the trail coming out of 40 to be null and then updates the head there."
"So we've produced a single linked list, right, with one cell."
It looks like we're doing okay on the push behaviors.
"Now, the pop behavior, in this sort of case may be relevant to think about, if it's totally empty."
"All right, we come in and we've got an empty cell, then the empty test should cause it to error and get down to the rest of the code."
"Let's say that B points to some sequence of things, 30, 20, 10, that taking the head value off and kind of writing it down somewhere, saying, okay, 30 was the top value."
The old cell is currently the head so we're keeping a temporary on this thing.
"And then head equals head error next, which splices out the cell around so we no longer have a pointer into this 30."
"The only place we can get back to it is with this temporary variable we assigned right here of old and then we delete that old to reclaim that storage and then our list now is the values 20 and 10, which followed it later in the list."
"To, also, do a little check what if it was the very last cell in the list that we're trying to pop?"
Does that have any special handling that we have overlooked if we just have a ten here with a null after it?
I'll go through the process of writing down the ten.
"Assigning old to where head is, and assigning head-to-head error next, where head error of next cell is null but pointing to that, and then we set our list to null, and then we delete this cell."
"And so after we're done, right, we have the empty list again, the head pointer back to null."
So it seems like we're doing pretty good job.
Have a bunch of cells.
Have one cell.
No cells.
Different things kind of seem to be going through here doing the right thing.
Let's do it.

"Are flushing in the rosy light,"
And all above is azure bright — Australia!
"There is a land where honey flows,"
"Where laughing corn luxuriant grows,"
Land of the myrtle and the rose;
On hill and plain the clust'ring vine
"Is gushing out with purple wine,"
And cups are quaffed to thee and thine — Australia!
There is a land where treasures shine
Deep in the dark unfathom'd mine
For worshippers at Mammon's shrine;

The sending of streaming data itself is not part of the RTSP protocol. Most RTSP servers use the standards-based RTP as the transport protocol for the actual audio/video data. The RTSP server from RealNetworks also features RealNetworks' proprietary RDT as the transport protocol.
"Alexandria, Indiana"
"Alexandria is a city in the state of Indiana, in the United States. It was settled during the 1830s and 1840s by people who thought it would be linked by the planned 296-mile long Indiana Central Canal.

Wi-Fi deauthentication attack
"A Wi-Fi deauthenticatoon attack is a kind of denial of service attack that can be used in certain wireless networks. In a Wi-Fi network, devices such as computers communicate with a wireless access point. To get an iP address, each devices needs to be authenticated, so the access point knows the device. In this context, there also is a frame (or a command) that tells a device that it is no longer authenticated. As the protocol does not require these frames to be encrypted, an attacker can simply send such a command to deconnect a device. The attacker only needs to know the MAC address of the victim. This address is sent unencrypted with each frame."

A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65,535. Port 0 is reserved, but is able to be used if the sending process does not expect messages in response."
"Ports 1 through 1023 (hexadecimal 0x3FF) are named ""well-known"" ports and on Unix-like operating systems, binding to one of these ports requires superuser (root) access."
"Ports 1024 through 49,151 (0xBFFF) are registered ports."

Manslaughter
"Manslaughter is the crime of killing a person. When a person is killed, lawyers also look at the reasons, and motives why this person was killed. If the death of a person was not on purpose, but the killer did something that resulted in the death of the another person, this is usually called manslaughter, in English. It is less serious than if a person was killed on purpose (sometimes with planning involved), which is called murder, in English. Killing someone in self-defence may be manslaughter. Depending on the circumstances, killing in self-defence may be no crime at all. Negligent homicide is an even lesser crime."
"Manslaughter is a relatively new legal concept. It was first mentioned in an English statute in 1547, but was interpreted very loosely and not earnestly enforced, instead usually charging with murder. Very few countries had manslaughter on their books until the latter half of the 20th century. In fact, no jurisdiction in the United States had manslaughter on its books until the 20th century. England and the United States were the first two countries to introduce manslaughter into their laws."

Incarnation (Christianity)
"The Incarnation is the Christian belief that Jesus Christ is the God of Israel in a human body. The word incarnate comes from Latin and means “in the flesh” (in=in, carnis=flesh). The incarnation is a basic teaching of Christianity. It is based on the New Testament of the Holy Bible. The incarnation is the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second person of the triune God; took on a human body and everything that is human and became both man and God. In the Bible its teaching is in the Gospel of John, where in chapter 1 verse 14 (abbreviated as “John 1:14”), it says “And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,”"
"To Clarify, the holy trinity is made up of 3 divine persons'. The Father God, the Son, Jesus and the Holy spirit. The Holy Spirit is described in many situations, but the most commonly known one is the tongues of fire that rest upon Jesus' 12 disciples' heads and it empowers them to speak different languages and preach the good news of Jesus the Christ. His teachings and way of life allow us to find peace and harmony and help others in need. By doing as he taught us, we can become better people and show God's love through us mortal beings."
"In the Incarnation, normally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus Christ, who was both ""truly God and truly man"". The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at the Feast of the Incarnation, which is better known as the Annunciation."
"This is center to the traditional Christian faith held by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and most Protestants. Other views on the subject have been considered in the past, but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies."
"In recent past, another doctrine known as ""Oneness"" has gained credit amongst Pentecostal groups (see below), but has been rejected by other Christians."

RB Leipzig
RB Leipzig (RasenBallsport Leipzig e.V.) is a German football club from Leipzig.
History.
The club was founded on 19 May 2009 by the Red Bull Company. It was formed out of the SSV Markranstädt. Due to the regulations of the DFB the name Red Bull Leipzig for marketing reasons was forbidden so they were called RB (short for RasenBallsport). Also the logo was forbidden.
"The company was sure that there is a great chance to form a new club, because with the Zentralstadion (now Red Bull Arena) there was a good stadium and there is no club in professional football in the area. The club is now in the Bundesliga. Like in Salzburg many fans protested against this deal because they had the fear that the fanculture will vanish and football will be only a business. So they wanted a ""normal"" football club."
"They started in the Oberliga Nordost-Süd(5th level) and became 1st in the 2009/10 season. But the next season they failed to gain promotion to the 3. Bundesliga. So the coach was changed, the new one is the Austrian Peter Pacult. The first match under the new coach was a 3:2 win in the German Cup (1st round) versus VfL Wolfsburg from the Bundesliga."

LNWR electric units
"During 1909-1922, the London and North Western Railway embarked on a large-scale project to electrify their whole London inner-suburban network, encompassing the lines from London Euston to Watford and the North London Railway from London Broad Street to Richmond. This also included branch lines such as Watford to Croxley Green (where a depot was built to house the electric units), and links to what was to become the London Underground network. For this reason, the lines were electrified using the fourth rail 630V DC system, the electricity being generated at the LNWR's own power station in Stonebridge Park. The first electric passenger trains ran in 1914, limited to the West London line route (Willesden to Earls Court), and full services over the whole network did not begin until 1922, work having been delayed by the First World War. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway extended the network in 1927 by electrifying the branch to Rickmansworth."

Looking back at this era, Michael Cuscuna of Mosaic Records said, “ What John Hermansader and Paul Bacon really did was evoke the feeling of the music. They used everything from Bauhaus designs to things that were really otherworldly.” Angelynn Grant adds, “When people think of Blue Note covers they think of Frank Wolff”s photography and Reid Miles design. But John Hermansader laid the groundwork that got them going along that path.” Richard Cook, who wrote Blue Note Records: The Biography states, “Hermansader in particular balanced the twin issues of photography and type in a way that would mirror the concerns of the Blue Note of the years ahead.”"

Journalism sourcing
"In journalism, a source or news source is a person, written thing, or other way of getting knowledge gives the reporter information that is new. Sources can be official records, books or other printed works, broadcasts, people who work for governments or businesses, organizations and corporations, people who saw and heard crimes, accidents, or other news, and people to whom a news event or issue is important."
"According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), many things can make a source bona fide, or good, or bad. Reporters should build good relationships with sources so that they trust each other, especially if they write about the same kind of thing often. These reporters are called ""beat reporters."" Beat reporters should also not become close friends with their sources. Journalists should also be skeptical. That means they should wonder whether the source is telling the truth or whether they are lying or wrong. For example, the City News Bureau of Chicago wrote ""If your mother says she loves you, check it out."" Journalists should not use only one source. Instead, they should find many sources that agree with each other, especially when they are writing about a controversy, or something people might disagree or fight about."

Operation (mathematics)
"In mathematics, an operation is a function which takes one or more inputs (called operands) and produces an output. Some of the most common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, all of which take two inputs and produce an output. These are called binary operations, and are often used when solving math problems. Other types of operations are called unary operations, which take only one input and produce an output."
"There are more operations than these, including raising numbers to exponents, taking the root and applying the logarithm."
Below is a list of the most used operations.
List of mathematical operations.
Addition.
"Addition is the first arithmetic operation and hyperoperation. It is the inverse operation of subtraction. The terms in an addition are called ""addends"", and the result of an addition is called a ""sum""."
The symbol for addition is +
Examples of additions:
formula_1
formula_2
formula_3
formula_4
formula_5
"Any number plus zero is the same number (formula_6). This is called the ""additive identity""."
For example: formula_7
"Changing the order of the addends in an addition does not change its sum. This is called the ""commutative property of addition""."

Work.
"Shpataraku was a painter in the Orthodox tradition of icons and Byzantine church frescoes, active between 1736 and 1767. His works combine Byzantine tradition and Italian Renaissance influences."
Death.
"Shpataraku was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan. His family took his body and buried him in his village with his head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built later to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals, on September 21."

Elastin
Elastin is part of connective tissue. It is an elastic protein which allows many tissues in the body to go back to their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin helps skin return to its original position when handled. Elastin is also used in places where mechanical energy is stored.
"Elastin is important in blood vessels because it helps blood to flow. It is common in large elastic blood vessels such as the aorta. Elastin is also very important in the lungs, ligaments, the skin, the bladder, and elastic cartilage. It is present in all vertebrates above the jawless fish."
"In humans, elastin is encoded by the ""ELN"" gene."
Icterid
"The Icteridae are a family of small to medium-sized New World songbirds. They are usually brightly colored. Most species have black as a main plumage color, often enlivened by yellow, orange or red. The family is extremely varied in size, shape, behavior and coloration."
"This group includes the New World blackbirds, New World orioles, the bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas and caciques. They are only distantly related to the Old World common blackbird (which is a thrush) or the Old World orioles."
"Icterids are unusual in songbirds because they have considerable sexual dimorphism. For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15 cm in length (6 in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families."
"One unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively. This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food."

Water treatment
Water treatment is treating water to make it suitable to be used. Providing drinking water is one of the main uses of water treatment.
Many factories also need very clean water to make steam or to make high quality products. Some of this water has to be made very pure with almost no other chemicals dissolved in it.
Treating sewage so that it does not cause harm to the environment is another use of water treatment.
Which type of water is generally used in the treatment of water?
"Saline water can be treated to yield fresh water. Two main processes are used, reverse osmosis or distillation. Both methods require more energy than water treatment of local surface waters, and are usually only used in coastal areas or where water such as groundwater has high salinity."

How is water treated to make it drinkable?
"Filtration - The clear water on top passes through filters composed of sand, gravel and charcoal to remove dissolved particles such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses and chemicals. Disinfection - Chlorine or chloramine is added to kill parasites, bacteria, viruses and germs.Apr 14, 2016"
What is the difference between water treatment and water purification?

History.
"The station was built as the terminus of what would become the Hudson Bay Railway in 1908. At first it served by terminating services from the cities in the south. but later destinations were expanded. By 1929 trains were running to Churchill, Thompson, Flin Flon, Lynn Lake, Winnipeg, Saskatoon and Prince Albert. By the 1960s all train services were operated by CN. In 1978 Serives were taken over by Via Rail whom at the time operated a total of 18 departures per week out of the station."
The 1978 timetable consisted of:
In 1980 terminating services from Saskatoon were cancelled. Then in 1981 Via received a budget cut which saw tri-weekly services to thompson and to Winnipeg via Swan River discontinued. In 2002 services to Lynn Lake were cut back to Pukatawagan followed by the service being cancelled in 2006 and replaced by a twice weekly mixed use train operated by the local first nations. In 2011 one of the 3 weekly trips to and from Churchill was made to terminate here rather than continue on to Winnipeg. In 2018 flooding saw services to Churchill cut back to Gillam and they weren't restored until over a year later. During the Covid 19 Pandemic terminating services were cancelled and service to Winnipeg and Churchill were retained on a once weekly freequency. This is because the route served vital communites without reliable road access. Service has since reached pre-pandemic levels.

Currently The Pas sees 7 departures per week to a few destinations:
The Pas also sees 1 train per week which arrives from Churchill which terminates there.
Fly orchid
"The fly orchid, ""Ophrys insectifera"", is a flower which uses scent for mimicry."
The plant uses scent to mimic the wasps' female sexual pheromones. This attracts male wasps. The wasps pollinate the flowers as they try to mate with them.
"It is a remarkable example of sexually deceptive pollination and floral mimicry. The plant is pollinated by only two species of wasp of the genus ""Argogorytes""."
"The soil the orchid grows in is poor, and it needs mycorrhiza to help it get nutrients."
Emilia Romagna Grand Prix
"The Emilia Romagna Grand Prix is a Formula One motor racing event held at the Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari, often referred to as ""Imola"" after the town where it is located.

"The tradition started from Patriarch Francesco Barbaro in the church of St. Mary in the castle of Udin, from 1596 and 1616. Since the end of the 17th century many authors wrote many ""Nunsiadis"", among the other Zuan Tite Tomadin, Antoni De Zorz, Meni Pecile, Vigji Comencin, Zuan Tite Candot, Jacop Tomadin and Vitori Franz. The version of Candot is the most singed nowadays."

"The coal swamps were world-wide because, for that long time, the continents were close together in Gondwana. Therefore they had similar wet, tropical climates."
History.
The Glossopteridales arose in the Southern Hemisphere around the beginning of the Permian (~300 milliom years ago). Their distribution across several continents led Eduard Suess to suggest the southern continents were once together in a single supercontinent – Gondwana.
These plants went on to become the dominant elements of the southern flora through the rest of the Permian but disappeared in almost all places at the end of the Permian (~250mya).
"The only convincing Triassic records are very earliest Triassic leaves from Nidpur, India. Even these records are somewhat questionable owing to faulting and complex juxtapositioning of Permian and Triassic strata at Nidpur."
"Some textbooks cite the continuation of glossopterids into later parts of the Triassic and, in some cases into the Jurassic. These are mistakes based on misidentification of similar leaves, such as those of ""Gontriglossa"", ""Sagenopteris"", or ""Mexiglossa""."
"Glossopterids were, thus, one of the major casualties of the end-Permian mass-extinction event."
Gnetophyta
"The Gnetophytes are a group of seed plants with three genera. Their evolutionary relationships are unclear, but it is now clear that they are related to each other."

2 Girls 1 Cup
"2 Girls 1 Cup is the title of the trailer for Hungry Bitches, a scat-pornographic viral video produced by MFX Media. The trailer features two women defecating into a cup, taking turns eating feces, and vomiting into each other's mouths. ""Lovers Theme"" from Hervé Roy's Romantic Themes album released by Tele Music in 1992 plays throughout the video."
"This one-minute video is a viral video that became a well-known Internet meme among bloggers and message boards for its viewers reaction to the content. Around mid-October 2007, video sites such as YouTube were flooded with videos that show others' reactions to watching the video for the first time."
Origin.
"The video came from a Brazilian, Marco Fiorito, who talks of himself as a ""compulsive fetishist"". Fiorito first produced foot fetish videos but soon moved on to coprophagia. The movie was made by MFX-Video, one of several businesses owned by Fiorito. Fiorito says his movies are legal in Brazil, but authorities in the United States have branded some of his movies as dirty and filed charges against Danilo Croce, a Brazilian lawyer living in Florida, listed as an officer of a company shipping Fiorito's movies in the United States. Croce accepted a plea bargain and was sentenced to 3 years of unsupervised probation and forfeiture of $98,000. Fiorito said he did not know his movies were illegal in the United States and that his movies often contained chocolate instead of feces to appease some of his actors who were willing to appear in scat movies but not actually eat fecal matter."
"The first few seconds of the 2 Girls 1 Cup video contain the text ""MFX 1209"" (the product code for ""Hungry Bitches"") and the URL mfxvideos.com. The website is Fiorito's MFX-Video. This causes some in the media to incorrectly believe the video is one of the many Croce had to surrender to the Department of Justice but was somehow leaked in the process."
Reactions.
"2 Girls 1 Cup's spread because of the reactions it causes. Hundreds of videos exist on YouTube of users showing the original video to their friends and recording their reactions. Even Joe Rogan, host of ""Fear Factor"", a show known for the nasty things its players eat, had to turn away in a reaction video posted to his blog. A reaction video starring Kermit the Frog proved very popular on the Digg. In January 2008, ""Slate"" magazine wrote about the reaction video with a slideshow about the reactions."

Facing the enemy's heavy fire, he displayed extraordinary bravery throughout the charge, and was the first to reach the enemy trenches, where he quickly killed one of the enemy with his pistol, allowing his men to continue the assault. His leadership and valor turned the tide in the Battle for San Juan Hill.

Béarnaise sauce
"Béarnaise sauce () is a sauce made of clarified butter, egg yolks, and herbs. It is considered to be a 'child' of the mother Hollandaise sauce, one of the five mother sauces in French haute cuisine. The difference is only in their flavouring: Béarnaise uses shallot, chervil, peppercorn, and tarragon, while Hollandaise uses lemon juice."
"In appearance it is light yellow and opaque, smooth and creamy."
Béarnaise is a traditional sauce for steak.
History.
"Although a similar recipe was published in 1818, Béarnaise sauce was likely first created by the chef Collinet, the inventor of puffed potatoes (), and served at the 1836 opening of ""Le Pavillon Henri IV"", a restaurant at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, not far from Paris. Evidence for this is reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was named for Henry IV of France, a gourmet himself, who was born in the former province of Béarn."
Preparation.
"A Béarnaise sauce is simply clarified butter, an egg yolk, a shallot, a little tarragon vinegar. It takes years of practice for the result to be perfect."
"Like Hollandaise sauce, there are several methods for the preparation of Béarnaise sauce. Please refer to the Preparation section of that article for basics. Here we highlight the differences."
"The most common preparation is a ""Bain-marie"" method where a reduction of vinegar is used to acidify the yolks. Escoffier calls for a reduction of wine, vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon and crushed peppercorns (later strained out), with fresh tarragon and chervil to finish instead of lemon juice. Others are similar. Alternatively, the flavourings may be added to a finished Hollandaise (""sans"" lemon juice)."

"In WWII, he commanded the German Army in North Africa during the North African Campaign (1940-1943) in a long struggle against the British 8th Army. He was finally defeated at El Alamein. Later in the war, he commanded the German forces defending the French coast against the Allied Normandy invasion (1944)."
"Rommel was well liked by the German public and respected by the Allies. He was thought to be chivalrous and humane, when other German leaders were not. His famous ""Afrikakorps"" was not accused of any war crimes. Soldiers captured by his army were treated well and orders to kill captured Jewish soldiers and civilians were ignored."
"Rommel knew of the plan by senior officers to assassinate Hitler in 1944. When it failed, all concerned were tortured and executed. Hitler offered him the choice of suicide or court-martial, and he committed suicide. His death was announced as the death of a hero in battle."
Early life and career.
"Rommel was born in Heidenheim, Germany, 45 kilometers (28 mi) from Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg which was then part of the German Empire, on November 15, 1891. He was baptised on 17 November 1891. His father, Erwin Rommel (18601913) was a math teacher, and later a secondary school headmaster at Aalen. His mother was Helene von Lutz, the daughter of a local government official. Rommel was the second of four children; Karl, Gerhard, and Helene. Rommel wrote that his ""early years passed very happily."""
"At the age of 14, Rommel and a friend built a full-scale glider that was able to fly short distances. Young Erwin thought about being an engineer, and he showed a talent with technical work; however, because of his father, young Rommel joined the local 124th Württemberg Infantry Regiment as an officer cadet in 1910 and, shortly after, was sent to the Officer Cadet School in Danzig. He graduated on 15 November 1911, and was a lieutenant in January 1912."
"While at Cadet School, early in 1911, Erwin Rommel had met his future wife, 17-year-old Lucia Maria Mollin (also called ""Lucie"") (b. 6 June 1894 in Danzig; d. 26 September 1971 in Stuttgart). They married on November 27, 1916, in Danzig, and on December 24, 1928 had a son, Manfred, who would later become the mayor of Stuttgart. Manfred died in 2013. After having met Lucie, some historians think that Rommel also had an affair with a woman called Walburga Stemmer in 1913, and they had a daughter named Gertrud."
World War I.
"In World War I, Rommel fought in France, as well as in Romania and Italy, first as a member of the 6th Württemberg Infantry Regiment, and then in the Württemberg Mountain Battalion of the ""Alpenkorps."" While serving with that unit, he gained a reputation for making quick tactical decisions and taking advantage of enemy confusion. He was wounded three times and awarded the Iron Cross; First and Second Class."
"Rommel also received Prussia's highest medal, the Pour le Mérite after fighting in the mountains of west Slovenia, in Battles of the Isonzo–Soca front. The award came as a result of the Battle of Longarone, and the capture of Mount Matajur, Slovenia, and its defenders, numbering 150 Italian officers, 9,000 men, and 81 pieces of artillery. His battalion used gas during the battles of the Isonzo and also played a key role in the victory of the Central Powers over the Italian army at the Battle of Caporetto. While fighting at Isonzo, Rommel was taken prisoner by the Italians. He escaped, and because he spoke Italian, he was back to the German lines within two weeks. Later, when the German and Italian armies were allied during the Second World War, Rommel realised that their lack of success in battle was due to poor leadership and equipment, which when fixed, easily made them equal to German forces."
World War II.
Poland 1939.
"Rommel was a commander of the ""Führerbegleithauptquartier"" (Führer escort headquarters) during the Poland campaign, often moving up close to the front in the ""Führersonderzug"" train, seeing much of Hitler. After the Polish defeat, Rommel returned to Berlin to organize the Führer's victory parade, taking part himself as a member of Hitler's entourage. During the Polish campaign, Rommel was asked to help one of his wife's relatives, a Polish priest who had been arrested. When Rommel asked the Gestapo for information, the Gestapo found no information about the man's existence."
France 1940.

Herbert, the eldest, became a cardinal and archbishop of Westminster, and John, the youngest, auxiliary bishop of Salford. Another brother, Reginald, married Julia Shanahan, sister-in-law of Sir Patrick Jennings. Four of his five sisters became nuns."
"Because of his health he was educated at home in a religious atmosphere. In 1850 he was sent to St Gregory's College at Downside near Bath. His mother's death in 1853 made him think of a religious life and on 12 September he joined the Benedictines, becoming Brother Bede. In 1855 at his father's request and expense, he was sent to Rome for further study under the guidance of the Italian scholar and reformer, Angelo Zelli-Jacuzzi.

Royal National Lifeboat Institution
"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is an agency which rescues people at sea in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, as well as on some large rivers."
"The RNLI is a charity. Two-thirds of its funding comes from money left in people's wills. Most of its crew members are volunteers. The RNLI has 237 lifeboat stations and 444 lifeboats. These are boats that travel from the shore to rescue people at sea, rather than lifeboats that are used for escaping from a ship. Their crews rescued on average 22 people a day in 2015. The RNLI also provides beach lifeguards and flood rescue teams."
"The RNLI cannot be called for help directly. In the event that someone is in danger at sea, the coastguard of the country or territory should be called on 999 or 112. The coastguard organize the search for those in danger. They will then call the RNLI if their help is needed. Not all lifeboats in the UK and Ireland are run by the RNLI; there are some independent lifeboat agencies."

Isaac Newton was the first person to solve to the general two-body problem.

"Looking at the generalizations, there are two other problems which are related:"
Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Twelfth Amendment (Amendment XII) to the United States Constitution was proposed in Congress on December 9, 1803. It was ratified by the state legislatures on June 15, 1804. It provided new procedures for electing the President and Vice President. Before the amendment, each member of the Electoral College cast a single vote. The candidate who received the largest number of votes became the President. The candidate receiving the next highest number of votes became the Vice President. The Twelfth Amendment changed the process to the current system whereby one vote is cast for the President and one for the Vice President."
Background.
"The Constitutional Convention of 1787 went over several different proposals for electing the President. Some wanted Congress to choose the President. Other suggestions included selection by the state legislatures, by the state governors or by a congressional committee. Near the end of the convention the question was turned over to a committee called the Committee of Eleven for leftover business. They devised a system called the Electoral College. The plan was accepted and was added to the Constitution."
"In 1789 the Electoral College unanimously elected George Washington as the first president. He was reelected in 1792. In both cases he was the only president to receive all of the electoral votes. In the 1796 election, Washington declined to run. His Vice President, John Adams, and his running mate Thomas Pinckney ran for President and Vice President respectively. Alexander Hamilton tried to use his influence to get Pinckney more votes, making Adams the Vice President again. But the scheme backfired when Thomas Jefferson got more votes than Pinckney, but Adams won more of the electoral votes. This made Adams the President and Jefferson the Vice President."
"The 1800 Presidential election showed the deep problems in the electoral college system. Jefferson ran against Adams again. Both had running mates. Pinckney was again the running mate of Adams for the Federalist Party. Aaron Burr was Jefferson's running mate for the Democratic-Republican Party. Jefferson and Burr received the same number of votes creating a tie between two candidates from the same political party. Under the Constitution, the matter was to be decided by the House of Representatives. In the House, the two tied again in 35 votes. Only on the 36th ballot was the deadlock broken and Jefferson was elected president."
"The solution to the problem became the Twelfth Amendment. It was proposed by Congress on December 9, 1803. Three days later it was submitted to the states for ratification. Fourteen of the seventeen states (at the time) ratified it and the amendment was added to the Constitution on September 25, 1804."
Provisions.
"The Electoral College remained much the same under the Twelfth Amendment. But the process for choosing a president and vice president changed. Under the Twelfth Amendment an elector must cast separate votes for the President and Vice President. If nobody gets the majority of the votes, the process remains the same as before; the House of Representatives decides."

Hurricane Ida (2009)
"Hurricane Ida was the last storm in the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed in the southwestern Caribbean on November 4 after being in that area for a few days. After becoming a depression it quickly got stronger and became a tropical storm and a hurricane shortly before it struck Nicaragua. Over Central America, Hurricane Ida weakened very fast, becoming downgraded to a tropical depression before the end of the day on November 5."
"By November 6, Ida went back into the Caribbean and later became a hurricane again. Its strength changed a few times before it died on November 10 off the coast of Alabama. Reports show that Hurricane Ida caused $5.6 million in damage and caused 2 deaths."
Storm history.
"Ida was tracked back to a tropical wave that entered the western Caribbean Sea on November 1. A low soon formed near the tropical wave. This low did not move very much and it also got a lot of clouds near the middle of it. There was hardly any wind shear, which allowed for more clouds to form."
"On November 4, the tropical wave National Hurricane Center began call it Tropical Depression Eleven. The new tropical depression quickly got stronger and became Tropical Storm Ida soon after that. An Aircraft went into Ida and soon found winds at 65 miles per hour, which meant it was nearly a hurricane."
"Continuing to the northwest, Tropical Storm Ida was upgraded to Hurricane Ida when winds got to 80 miles per hour; at the time, it was put at only 75 miles per hour. Soon after this, Hurricane Ida made landfall in Nicaragua on November 5. Ida weakened quickly over land and was downgraded to a tropical storm just after landfall. Near the end of the day on November 5, Tropical Storm Ida weakened to a tropical depression."
"Tropical Depression Ida survived its passage over land and went back into the Caribbean on November 6. Over the western Caribbean, it quickly became a tropical storm again. After moving north, Tropical Storm Ida became a hurricane again. &lt;ref name=""update11/7/09""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its highest winds on November 8 while it crossed between Cuba and Mexico; they were measured at 105 miles per hour, making it a category 2 hurricane. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were not warm enough to keep Ida at this strength. so it quickly weakened back to a tropical storm."
"For only six hours, it became a hurricane again before it became extratropical on November 10 while it was just south of Alabama. At the time, it looked like it stayed as a tropical storm and made landfall in Alabama, this was later noted as incorrect. Its remnants formed a strong nor'easter that affected some of the states of the East Coast of the United States."
Impact.
"Damage in Nicaragua was near $2.1 million and there were no people killed. In El Salvador, it seemed at first that killed over 100 people, this was discovered as a mistake later on."

The Rugby Championship
"The Rugby Championship is an annual rugby union competition between the national teams of the sport's four strongest Southern Hemisphere nations—New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and Argentina. It began in 1996, a year after the sport became professional, as the Tri Nations. At the time, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa competed for the Tri Nations Trophy. Beginning in 2012, Argentina joined the competition."
"During the Tri Nations era, the contest began in July, during the Southern Hemisphere winter, and ran through September. For most of that era, each team played every other team twice, once at home and once away. Later on, each team played the others three times. When the competition added Argentina, it returned to a pure home-and-away format, with a total of 12 games played. Also, due to a slight change in the sport's calendar, The Rugby Championship now begins in August and runs through October. This format is used except in years in which the Rugby World Cup is played (every four years, in the year before the Summer Olympics). In those years, each team plays the others only once, with a total of six games played."
"Teams are awarded competition points for a win, but can also earn 'bonus' points. At the end of the series, the team with the most competition points wins the trophy. The team that wins the competition is usually considered to be the best rugby union team in the Southern Hemisphere for that year."

COVID-19 pandemic
"The COVID-19 pandemic, also called the coronavirus pandemic, is a current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The outbreak started in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) called it a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses gave the virus its name. As of September 4, 2022, more than 600 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in almost every country on Earth. More than six million people have died of COVID-19, and more than 580 million people have defeated, or recovered from the disease."
"The virus usually moves from one person to another with small drops made when coughing or sneezing. It mostly spreads when people are close to each other, which is why social distancing is encouraged. Coronavirus can also spread when people touch a surface with the virus, and then they touch their face. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and trouble breathing. The illness can worsen with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. As of January 2021, a number of vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed, but only a few have been approved as safe for use. The first vaccine to be approved was created by Pfizer and BioNTech, followed by the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine distribution has begun in many countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. The United Kingdom was the first western country to administer a COVID-19 vaccine. No antiviral medicine for COVID-19 is available. Doctors usually give patients supportive therapy instead. People can avoid spreading the virus by regularly washing their hands, covering their mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, staying away from crowds, wearing medical or cloth face coverings, and being alone for people who think they are infected, also known as quarantining."
"The outbreak might be from a coronavirus that usually lives in bats. This infected another animal, possibly a pangolin. It then changed inside that other animal until it could infect humans. It possibly originated at a wet market, Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. A 55-year-old person from Hubei province was the first human to contract the virus on November 17, 2019. A 61-year-old man who was a regular customer at the market was the first person to die from the virus on January 11, 2020. The exact origin of the virus is still unknown since the market in Wuhan sold a variety of live wild animals in cages. Chinese tourists have spread the virus by traveling to other countries and made it a worldwide pandemic."
Racism and xenophobia against Chinese people and Asians increased during the pandemic.
"In November 2020, two companies, Pfizer and Moderna, said they had finished making COVID-19 vaccines. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, have been tested. Both were over 90% effective. Countries began planning to give the vaccine to many people."
"25 other vaccines have been approved by at least one country, and many others are being developed."
"The United States has the most deaths from the virus. More than 1,000,000 Americans have died from the virus. California had the most COVID-19 cases in the country."
Epidemiology.
Epidemiology is the study of how diseases affect the health and illness of groups of people.
Background.
"On 31 December 2019, Chinese health authorities reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in Wuhan, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020."
"On 9 June 2020, a Harvard University study suggested that COVID-19 may have been spreading in China as early as August 2019, based on hospital car park usage and web search trends."

Sleeping problems.
"A good night’s sleep is extremely important for one’s quality of life. People may have trouble going to sleep, staying asleep or getting enough sleep. This usually means that they are too sleepy in the daytime."
"There are many things that influence sleep. Also some substances, called stimulants – coffee is an example – can cause poor sleep. When people have just eaten something, the body is busy digesting what they have eaten. This can cause poor sleep, too. Worrying and stress can also cause poor sleep."
There are many diseases that cause poor sleep. Fever can lead to bad dreams. Poor sleep can be a side effect of some medications.
"Sleep disorders directly influence how a person sleeps. Examples of sleep disorders are narcolepsy, sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep disorders."
The four most common sleep disorders are:
"Sleep specialists - doctors specialized in sleeping problems - often suggest better sleep hygiene to people with sleeping problems. Sleep hygiene means things people can try, such as:"
North Macedonia
"North Macedonia ( - Severna Makedonija) officially the Republic of North Macedonia ( - ""Republika Severna Makedonija""; ) is a country located on the Balkan peninsula and in Southeastern Europe. It was part of Yugoslavia. North Macedonia borders Serbia to the north, Albania to the west, Greece to the south, and Bulgaria to the east. The country's currency is the Macedonian denar (MKD)."
"The capital and largest city is Skopje, with more than 500,000 residents. It has many smaller cities. Some important ones are Bitola, Prilep, Tetovo, Kumanovo, Ohrid, Veles, Stip, and Strumica."
"North Macedonia is often called ""a land of lakes and mountains"". Three large lakes are on the borders of Albania and Greece, and there are many smaller ones. Sixteen mountains are higher than 2000 meters above sea level."
"North Macedonia is a member of the United Nations and World Trade Organization (WTO). It joined NATO on 30 March 2020. Since December 2005, it is a candidate for joining the European Union."
"The language spoken by the majority of the population is Macedonian. Albanian is also spoken by the Albanian minority (25%) living in the country. North Macedonia has two official languages, Macedonian and Albanian (since 2019)."
History.
"Ethnic Macedonians are Slavic peoples. The Slavs invaded and settled the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. What is now North Macedonia used to be the Bulgarian occupation zone of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Vardarska Macedonia became a Communist state in 1945 and called itself the Socialist Republic of Macedonia in the southeastern part of the country of Yugoslavia. When that country broke up in 1991, North Macedonia became independent."
In past centuries the territory which today is the Republic of North Macedonia was ruled by many different states such as Bulgaria and many other empires.
"During the Yugoslav Wars, Macedonia was mostly peaceful. However in 2001, fighting broke out between ethnic Albanians and Slavic Macedonians. The fighting ended with the Ohrid Agreement."
Earliest residents.
"People have been living in North Macedonia for thousands of years. Neolithic people lived in Macedonia from 7000 to 3500 BCE. The Iliad mentions the Kingdom of Paeonia in Macedonia. From 1000 to 1 BCE, Dacians, Thracians,Illyrians, Celts, and Greeks lived in Northern Macedonia."
Alexander the Great's empire.
"The Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedonia was just hundreds of small, independent, city-states. One example of a city state is Illyria. They sometimes merged together, but not often. One city-state that grew over time was the kingdom of Macedon. The Greek kingdom of Macedon is best known for Alexander the Great. He invaded and controlled the Middle East (excluding Arabia),Turkey, Greece, Egypt, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Gujarat state of India. However, when Alexander died in 323 BCE, at the age of 33, he lost his vast empire. The empire was divided into 5 countries, Lysimachia (Macedon), Cassander (Northern Greece), the Antigonid Empire (Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Southern Greece), the Ptolemaic Empire (Egypt), and the Seleucid Empire (Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan)."
Roman rule.
"Towards the end of the 3rd century BCE, the Romans invaded the Balkan peninsula. Illyria was taken over in 9 CE. The North and East of Macedonia were taken over by the Roman Empire in the year 29 CE. They became the Roman province of Moesia. Starting in the 3rd century CE, the borders of Macedonia were being attacked by the Goths, Huns, Bulgars, Avars, and others. In 395 AD, the Roman Empire split in two. They were the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)."
Byzantine rule.
"Although, Macedonia was part of the Byzantine Empire, there was little Byzantine influence. In the mid-6th century, Slavic tribes started to settle in Macedonia. From the 7th century to the 13th century, Byzantine Macedonia was governed by local princes and kings, allied with the Byzantine Empire. In the 9th century, the Byzantine Empire brought Christianity to Macedonia. The people who brought Christianity to Macedonia were saints Cyril and Methodius. Their goal was to bring Christianity and the Cyrillic alphabet to Slavs in Europe."
Ottoman rule.
"The Ottoman Empire was originally a small city-state in Turkey. The city-state grew, and it invaded Adrianople in 1354. From there, it expanded and took over Turkey. Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire, did not get invaded by the Ottomans until 1453. After the Battle of the Maritsa River, the Ottomans conquered southern Serbia and Macedonia. Macedonia was under Ottoman Rule until 1913."
Yugoslav rule.
"After the Ottoman Empire dissolved, Macedonia became a part of the newly formed country Yugoslavia. From 1914 to 1941, Yugoslavia was a monarchy. During WW2, the Axis Powers took over Yugoslavia. Macedonia was taken over by Bulgaria. The Axis powers left Yugoslavia after WW2. After WW2, Yugoslavia became a communist state. Josip Broz Tito was the leader of Yugoslavia from 1944 to 1980. In 8 September 1991, Macedonia became an independent state."
Naming dispute with Greece.
"Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia were arguing over the name Macedonia. The United Nations calls the Republic of North Macedonia, ""the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"" (FYROM) (Macedonian: ""Поранешна Југословенска Република Македонија - ПЈРМ"" - ""Poranešna Jugoslovenska Republika Makedonija -PJRM""). The north and northeast part of Greece has been called Macedonia for ages and officially since 1912, just like Kent, the southeast county of England, has been called Kent for a long time. 'FYROM' is also used by NATO and many other international organisations. But, many countries now call the country 'Republic of Macedonia'. The United Kingdom, for example, uses Republic of Macedonia in the diplomatic list."
"The ""kami"" of Emperor Buretsu was venerated at a Shinto shrine in Takaichi, Yamato province."
"According to the Imperial Household Agency, the emperor's final resting place is in an earthen tumulus (""kofun""). Buretsu is venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (""misasagi"") which is associated with the burial mound."
Prefectures of Japan
"are one of the basic local entities of Japan. They are the 47 subdivisions of the country. Prefectures are the governmental bodies of Japan which are larger than cities, towns, and villages."
History.
The former provinces of Japan were converted into prefectures between 1876 and 1879.
"The word ""todōfuken"" combines the suffixes of the names of the 47 prefectures. The four suffixes are:"
"Before World War II, different laws applied to ""fu"" and ""ken,"" but now two types of prefecture are the same, outside of their names."
Lists of prefectures.
List in Japanese ISO order.
"The prefectures are often grouped into these nine regions (""Chihō""). The regions are not formally specified, they do not have elected officials, and they are not corporate bodies. However, the practice of ordering prefectures based on their geographic region is traditional. This ordering is mirrored in Japan's International Organization for Standardization (ISO) coding. From north to south, the prefectures of Japan and their commonly associated regions are listed in traditional and in order:"
"Okinawa Prefecture is traditionally thought of as part of the Kyūshū region of Japan. Okinawa Prefecture is made up of islands which are southwest of the island of Kyushu. The Japanese government recognizes the prefecture as its own region in new 9-region, 11-region and 13-region systems."
List of provinces of Japan
"The List of Provinces of Japan changed over time. The number and borders of provinces evolved from the 7th century through the Meiji Period. In the 1870s, the provinces were replaced by prefectures."
"The traditional way of parsing the land of Japan was ""five provinces and seven circuits"" (""go-shichidō"")."
Five Provinces.
"The traditional five core provinces of Japan were called ""goki""."
Shichido.
"The traditional seven core circuits of Japan were called ""shichidō""."

"The island was changed from Ezo to Hokkaidō, and 11 provinces were established in 1869-1882."
Gilberto Kassab
"Gilberto Kassab ( or ; born 12 August 1960 in São Paulo) was the mayor of São Paulo, the biggest city in Brazil. He is a member of the right-wing Democrat party. Kassab became famous when he brought in laws to stop billboard advertising, which he said were ""visual pollution""."
Terra nullius
"Terra nullius means unclaimed territory. It is the correct term in international law. It means land which does not (at present) belong to any state. The term comes from the Latin, meaning ""Nobody's thing"". There is also an expression ""no man's land"", but that does not have a formal legal meaning."
"Rule over ""terra nullius"" can be got by occupying the territory. There are various legal problems about this concept, but in practice it is often the business of neighbouring states to decide by negotiation. Diplomacy may sometimes be replaced by warfare."
"Two territories that are currently ""terra nullius"" are Bir Tawil between Egypt and Sudan, and Marie Byrd Land, in Antarctica."

2016 Saxony-Anhalt state election
"The Saxony-Anhalt state election was held on 13 March 2016 in the German State of Saxony-Anhalt for the next composition of the Parliament of Saxony-Anhalt. The incumbent Governor is Reiner Haseloff of the CDU, governing with the SPD."
Post-election.
"The only realistic possibility would be a coalition government of the CDU, SPD and the Greens. Together, they would have a 2-seat majority . Other combinations (such as the CDU and The Left or CDU and AfD) are highly unlikely. The stark differences among the parties will make it harder for negotiations to create a coalition."

Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on January 23, 1933, the Twentieth Amendment (Amendment XX) to the United States Constitution moved the beginning and ending of the terms of the president and vice president from March 4 to January 20. It moved the start and end dates for members of Congress from March 1 to January 21. In both cases the start and end time is at noon. It also gives the procedure to follow if for some reason there is no president-elect."
Background.
"In the later part of the eighteenth century, when the Constitution was written, travel and communications were both very slow by modern standards. To cross the Atlantic Ocean could take several weeks. Traveling by horseback or by carriage on crude roads in the US could take even longer. Communications were mainly by letter or messenger. For these reasons the framers of the Constitution allowed for the longer periods of time it took to send and receive messages. Four months, the time from the election in November to the swearing-in in March, was necessary at the time."
"By the 1930s, a railroad passenger could cross the country in 3 days. The Post Office had been using airmail since 1918. But vastly improved travel times and communications were not the only reasons behind the Twentieth Amendment. The joint resolution calling for the amendment was sponsored by Republican Senator George William Norris of Nebraska. Called the ""Lame Duck"" Amendment, it acquired this name because Norris wanted to eliminate the lame-duck sessions of Congress where outgoing members still held office and voted on bills for several months before the new members could be sworn in. The bill he wrote applied to both houses of Congress, the offices of President and Vice-President."
Another area the amendment addressed was with the succession of the president if the president-elect died before taking office. It provides for the vice-president elect to become the president-elect and take office on January 20. The amendment also give Congress the power to legislate on other issues dealing with the succession of the president.
Effects of the Twentieth Amendment.
"The sessions of Congress between the election and the beginning of a new term are called ""lame duck"" sessions because members of Congress who were voted out of office still attend and can still vote. Originally the term ""lame duck"" was a financial term meaning those who could not repay a loan. As used in politics, a representative who lost an election was no longer accountable to the voters. As the framers of the Twentieth Amendment saw it, lame duck representatives should not be able to vote since voters had already rejected their views. The Twentieth Amendment only shortened the lame duck period by six weeks. Between 1933 and 2012, 18 lame-duck sessions of Congress have passed laws."

"Turkey is a popular place for tourists to visit. It has hundreds of kilometres of beaches on its Aegean and Mediterranean coasts, and many important historical places."
History.
Ancient Anatolia.
"The first major empire in the area was the Hittites (from the 18th century to the 13th century BCE). The Hittites, who spoke one of the Indo-European languages, developed a high culture in Central Anatolia. Their kingdom was destroyed by the Sea People in the 11th century BCE and the successor states were Lydia, Caria and Lycia."
"From 1950 BCE, Armenians and Assyrians inhabited parts of southeastern Turkey. The Assyrian capital was named Tushhan (900-600 BCE). The Assyrians ruled over southeastern Turkey until their empire was conquered by Babylonia in 612 BCE. Then Anatolia became home for various kingdoms including the Achaemenid Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms, Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire), Seljuk Empire, and Mongol Empire."
The Ottoman Empire.
"During the 14th century, after the fall of the Mongol Empire, Gazi Osman built a new empire named after himself: the Ottoman Empire. It became one of the longest existing empires of all time. The Empire also stretched across the Balkans, (Yugoslavia and Bulgaria) in Europe. The Empire was ruled by Islamic law, but other religions had certain minority rights."
"In World War I the Ottoman Empire was one of the Central Powers. During the war, 500,000 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were massacred in the so-called Armenian genocide. Turkey denies that the event was genocide. The Central Powers lost the war and the Ottoman Empire was destroyed, but after that Atatürk led the newly formed Turkish army to get rid of foreign enemies, like the Greeks and ousted the imperial Ottoman family from Anatolia."
Republic of Türkiye.
"Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was the first President of Turkey. He made many changes that made Turkey more modern. But some people did not like some of the changes that made life in Turkey more secular. Religious secondary schools were gotten rid of, for example. The opponents to Atatürk felt that he weakened Islam in the country. Later political disputes led to Coup d'état in 1960, 1971, and 1980, and several failed attempts."
"In 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus and later established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktaş became the first Turkish Cypriot president."
"On 15 July 2016, a coup d'état was attempted."
"In 2022, the government of Turkey started to use the Turkish spelling of Türkiye in both Turkish and English. However, Turkey remains the more common name."
People.
About 80 million people live in Turkey. Most of them are ethnic Turks. About 15% are ethnic Kurds. Many refugees from Syria (over 3 million) live in Turkey because they have run away from the Syrian civil war. Many Romani live in Istanbul and Edirne (European part of Turkey).
The biggest city in Turkey is Istanbul which has the biggest population of any city in Europe. Much of the population in Turkey is made up of young adults and adults.
"According to religiosity poll conducted in Turkey in 2019 by OPTİMAR, 89.5% of the population identifies as Muslim, 4.5% believed in God but did not belong to an organized religion, 2.7% were agnostic, 1.7% were atheist, 0.5% were belonged to the other religions, and 1.1% did not answer. Another poll conducted by Gezici Araştırma in 2020 interviewed 1,062 people in 12 provinces and found that 28.5% of the Generation Z in Turkey identify as irreligious."
"Turkish people have many ethnic and famous foods, such as mantı (Turkish ravioli), döner, kebap, Turkish delight (lokum), baklava, lahmacun, börek, köfte, and other foods."
"According to a study, Anatolia is genetically more closely related to the Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations. The Turks of Anatolia (Asian part of Turkey) have only 13% of genes from populations from Central Asia."
Majority and minorities.
"Most people in Turkey are Turks. The largest minority is Kurds. Kurds live mostly in Southeastern and Eastern Turkey. The second largest minority are the Romani, mostly live in East Thrace, the European side of Turkey."
Economy.
Turkey is in the OECD and the G-20 and is one of the 20 largest economies. The Turkish currency is called the Lira. The first coins were made in Turkey.
"In the 1970s, many Turks moved to other countries, like Germany, to escape the bad economy at the time and to get better jobs. They often come back to Turkey for summer holidays. Today, many of the people who left in the 1970s want to move back to Turkey."
"Until the 1980s the government owned most companies, but then Prime Minister Turgut Özal sold them. Before, foreigners were usually not allowed to buy companies, land or property. Turkey's international trade is mostly with the EU, the United States, the Russian Federation, and Japan. Turkey and the EU agreed not to put a lot of tax on what they buy and sell to each other. After that it was easier for Turkish factories to sell products to the EU and for business people in the EU to buy companies in Turkey."
Turkey's exports in 2010 were worth 117 billion United States dollars.
"Earthquakes in 1994, 1999, and 2001 slowed economic growth a bit. Turkey has no petroleum and not much natural gas so it buys them from other countries, like Russia. In 2010, oil was found in the Turkish City of Diyarbakir, but there was not enough oil to extract. Turkey is searching for natural gas in Turkish Northern Cyprus."
"Rich cities in Turkey include Istanbul, Ankara, İzmir, Edirne, Konya, Mersin (also known as İçel), and Antalya."
Culture.
Language.
"Most people in Turkey speak Turkish. It is written in Latin script and it belongs to the Turkic language group, which also includes many other languages spoken across Asia, such as Azerbaijani and Tatar. The Turkish language came from Central Asia, but now it is a bit different from the languages spoken in Central Asia. Turks living by the Mediterranean have southern, much thicker, and more masculine accents than western Turkey. Northerners, by the Black Sea have softer accents."
"The island of Sardinia has an area of and, after Sicily, is the second largest island in the Mediterranean Sea. It is long from North to South, and wide from West to East. It lies between 38° 51' and 41° 15' latitude north and 8° 8' and 9° 50' longitude east."
"The island is on the western Mediterranean Sea, between the island of Corsica to the north and Tunisia to the south. The Tyrrhenian Sea part of the Mediterranean is directly east of Sardinia, between the Sardinian east coast and the west coast of the Italian mainland peninsula."
"The Strait of Bonifacio (, , Gallurese: ""Bocchi di Bunifaciu"", ) is the strait between Corsica and Sardinia, named after the Corsican town Bonifacio. It is wide and divides the Tyrrhenian Sea from the western Mediterranean Sea."
Rivers.
"Sardinia has few major rivers, the largest being the Tirso, long, which flows into the western Mediterranean Sea, the Coghinas () and the Flumendosa ()."
Mountains and valleys.
"The highest peak is Punta La Marmora (), part of the Gennargentu group of mountains in the centre of the island. Other mountain chains are Monte Limbara () in the northeast, the Chain of Marghine and Goceano () running crosswise for towards the north, the Monte Albo (), the Sette Fratelli massif in the southeast, and the Sulcis Mountains and the Monte Linas ()."
"The mountain chains of the island are separated by wide valleys; the main ones are Campidano in the southwest between Oristano and Cagliari, and the Nurra in the northwest."
Islands.
There are many small islands around the main island of Sardinia. Some of them are:
Administrative divisions.
Sardinia is divided in eight provinces:

"A nuclear reactor is a machine that uses fission to generate heat. There are different designs which use different fuels. Most often, uranium-235 or plutonium-239 are the main components of these fuels."
"Most nuclear reactors are used to make electricity. In nuclear power plants heat from the fission reactions in the reactor changes water into steam. The steam is then used to power electric turbines which make electricity. As with other steam engines, the turbines take energy from the movement of the steam."
Some reactors are used for other purposes. Some reactors make neutrons for science research and others make radioactive isotopes. Some universities have small nuclear reactors to teach students how reactors work.
The first nuclear reactor was built in 1942 by a team of scientists led by Enrico Fermi. This was a part of the Manhattan Project which needed the fuel from the reactor to make the atomic bomb. The first nuclear reactor to make electricity was a small experimental reactor built in Idaho in 1951. It made just enough electricity for four light globes.
"Nuclear reactors are expensive to build because of the many safety features they need to have. There is also a problem with the huge amount of radioactive waste from the reactors. However they produce electricity cheaply, and do not pollute the air. There have been serious accidents at several nuclear reactors: Windscale (UK) 1957, Mayak (USSR) 1957, Three Mile Island (USA) 1979, Chernobyl (USSR) 1986 and Fukushima (Japan) 2011. Concerns about safety have limited the growth of nuclear power. There are about 437 reactors around the world which provide about 5% of the world's electricity."
Samobor
"Samobor is a city in Zagreb County, Croatia, population 36,206 It is west of Zagreb, between the eastern slopes of Samoborsko gorje (Samobor hills, the eastern part of the Žumberak Mountains), in the Sava river valley. It is part of the Zagreb metropolitan area."
"Samobor has been there since 1242, according to a document of endowment by King Bela IV. It is one of the earliest tourist resorts in the region, with the first tourist facilities dating back to 1810, oriented towards anglers, hunters and hikers."
Frankfurt (Oder)
"Frankfurt (Oder) or Frankfurt an der Oder (; abbreviated """", , Low Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Odru"", , Upper Sorbian: ""Frankobrod nad Wódru"", lit. 'Frankfurt at the Oder') is a town in Germany. It lies on the Oder river, which marks the current border between Germany and Poland (The so-called Oder-Neisse line). It's in the east of the state of Brandenburg."
"In January 1999, the town added a prefix ""Kleiststadt"" to refer to Heinrich von Kleist, who was born there in 1777. Today, about 65,000 people are living in Frankfurt an der Oder."
Cook Islands
"The Cook Islands are a group of islands in the southern Pacific. They form an independent state, but have strong ties with New Zealand. The 15 small islands have a total land surface of 240 square kilometers. About 18.000 people live on the islands, most of them from tourism. The largest island, Rarotonga, also holds the territory's capital, Avarua."
"The nation also has a distinctive Polynesian language known as Cook Island Maori, which is closely related to the Maori language of New Zealand and to the Tahitian language."
Map coloring
"Map coloring is a term used for two different concepts: In geography and mapmaking it is used to say that colors are assigned to certain areas on a map. Examples of this are coloring that show the countries or divisions of a country, but also to visualize other data, for example the altitude. The other use is in mathematics: There it is used to describe the problem of finding the minimal number of colors needed to color a given map."
In mapmaking.
"Color is very useful to show different features on a map. Typical uses of color include showing different countries, different temperatures, or different kinds of roads."
"Displaying the information in different colors can affect the understanding or feel of the map. In many cultures, certain colors have certain meanings. For example, red can mean danger, green can mean nature, and blue can mean water, which can be confused with the sea."
"Mapmakers may also use colors that are related to what they are mapping. For example, when mapping where it rains more or less, they may use different shades of blue. For a map of wildfires, they may use yellows, reds, and oranges. Carefully choosing colors is important so the map is easy to read and understand. Also, the mapmaker must take into account that many people have impaired color vision, and colors must be used such that these readers can see their differences."
QED
QED may mean:
Q.E.D.
"Q.E.D. is an acronym or initialism of the Latin phrase , which means ""what was to be demonstrated"". In other words, Q.E.D. means ""something was to be proven, and now it has been done""."
History.
"In the European Renaissance, scholars often wrote in Latin. The phrases ""Q.E.D."" was often used at the end of mathematical or philosophical proofs."
Equivalents in other languages.
"""Q.E.D."" is used in many languages, including:"
Five color theorem
"The Five color theorem is a theorem from Graph theory. It states that any plane which is separated into regions, such as a map, can be colored with no more than five colors. It was first stated by Alfred Kempe in 1890, and proved by Percy John Heawood eleven years later. Kempe also tried to prove it, but his proof failed. There are two restrictions which are placed on the maps: First, a country must be contiguous, there must be no exclaves, and secondly, countries that only touch in one point can be colored with the same color."
"There is also a four color theorem, which is stronger, and much more difficult to prove."
Silence procedure
"Silence procedure (French: ""procédure d'approbation tacite"") is a decision-making tactic or process used in international political contexts. The procedure is based on the Latin phrase ""qui tacet consentire videtur"" which means ""he who is silent is taken to agree"" or ""silence means consent""."
"The silence procedure is used to enhance the process of consensus-building. It is used by many international groups, including NATO, and the European Union (EU)."
"In the contexts of such multi-party groups, silence signifies a willingness to work together to limit the possible causes of paralysis."
Ahumada Municipality
"Ahumada is one of the 67 municipalities of Chihuahua, in northern Mexico. The municipal seat is Villa Ahumada. The municipality covers an area of 17,131.5 km²."
"As of 2005, the municipality had a total population of 11,727."
Villa Ahumada
"Villa Ahumada (officially Miguel Ahumada) is the seat of the Ahumada Municipality in the Chihuahua, Mexico. It had 8,753 inhabitants (2005). It is located along Highway 45, about south of Ciudad Juárez and north of the city of Chihuahua."
FCSB
"FCSB is a football team from Bucharest, Romania. It was founded on 7 June 1947 as ""ASA Bucureşti"" (""ASA Bucharest""). The original FC Steaua București team was part of the namesake CSA Steaua București sports club and belonged to the Ministry of National Defence. FC Steaua București was forced to change its name to FCSB in 2017. It has won the most championships in Romania, 26, and it is the only team from Romania to win a UEFA Champions League title. Its chairman is George Becali (usually ""Gigi"" Becali)."
Chevrolet Express
Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana are full sized passenger or cargo vans made via General Motors. These vans seat between eight and fifteen passengers. The cargo vans are used for commercial and business purposes. The Express/Savana vans were first produced around 1996.
"Weatherford, Texas"
"Weatherford is a city in Parker County, Texas near Fort Worth. It is part of Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area."
Green River Formation
"The Green River Formation is an Eocene rock formation on the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. It records sediment from a group of intermountain lakes. Its fine fossils make this a lagerstätte, a place of exceptional preservation."
"The various fossil beds of the Green River Formation span a 5 million year period, dating to between 53.5 and 48.5 million years ago (mya). During this period the climate moved from the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene."
"The sediments are deposited in very fine layers, in pairs: a dark layer from the growing season, and a light-hue inorganic layer in winter."
"Each pair of layers is called a varve and represents one year. The sediments of the Green River Formation present a continuous record of six million years. The mean thickness of a varve here is 0.18 mm, with a minimum thickness of 0.014 mm and maximum of 9.8 mm."
"The sedimentary layers were formed in a large area named after the present-day Green River, a tributary of the Colorado River. The formation is in three separate basins around the Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah:"
Conditions at the time.
The formation has many evaporites – minerals formed by the evaporation of lakes. This suggests that high salinity was one of the causes of the superb fossilisation.
Another factor was the frequent ash falls from nearby volcanoes. Rapid burial also prevents normal decomposition.
Climate.
"Fossils preserved suggest that the region was a low, subtropical, freshwater basin when the sediments accumulated."
"The Green River fossils show a transition between the moist early Eocene climate and the slightly drier mid-Eocene. The climate was moist and mild enough to support crocodiles, which do not tolerate frost, and the lakes were surrounded by sycamore forests. As the lake configurations shifted, each Green River location is distinct in character and time. The lake system formed over underlying river deltas and shifted in the flat landscape with slight tectonic movements"
Oil shale.
"The Green River Formation contains the largest oil shale deposits in the world. The 213 billion tons of oil shale contain an estimated 2.38 × 10¹¹ m³ (1.5 trillion US barrels) of shale oil. This is a tribute to the high volume of organic material that was buried. The source of the organic material was probably cyanobacteria, which thrive in warm alkaline lake conditions."
Fossils.
"The lagerstätten formed in anoxic conditions in the fine carbonate muds that formed in the lakebeds. Lack of oxygen slowed bacterial decomposition and kept scavengers away. Leaves of palms, ferns and sycamores, some showing the insect damage got during their growth, were covered with fine-grained sediment and preserved. Insects were preserved whole, even delicate wing membranes and spider spinnerets."
"The fauna included fish, alligators, bats, turtles, dog-sized horses, insects, and many other species of plants and animals"
Peggy Lee
"Norma Egstrom (May 26, 1920 - January 21, 2002) was an American actress and jazz singer. She is better known as Peggy Lee. She acted in many movies. She also wrote the music for them. She sang and acted for six decades. Lee was born in Jamestown, North Dakota."
Hurricane Alex (2010)
"Hurricane Alex was a rare June hurricane and the first tropical cyclone of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. The storm first struck near Belize as a tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became a hurricane and struck northeast Mexico; it was the first hurricane in June since Hurricane Allison in 1995. The storm killed 51 people (33 directly) and caused almost $1.9 billion in damage (2010 USD)."
Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum
"The Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum (Vietnamese: Lăng Hồ Chí Minh) is a large memorial to Vietnamese independence leader Hồ Chí Minh. It is located in Ba Ðình Square in Hà Nội. This is where his body is kept for people to pay their respects. President Hồ Chí Minh did not want a mausoleum at all. In his will, he said he wanted to be cremated and to have his ashes buried in the hills of the north, center, and south of Việt Nam. He said that he liked cremation because it was healthier than burial or a mausoleum and saved farmland. His successors did not let him have this wish. The government kept that part of his will secret. The government also pretended he died a day after he really did, because he really died on Independence Day and they did not tell anyone."
"Many aspects of ""Uncle Ho's"" last will and testament were altered or, as stated above, ignored. In his last days he was surrounded by those who formed what is now Vietnam's political system, while those loyal to him and his wishes were systematically kept or chased away. Others were put on a bus and executed."
Meng Tian
"Meng Tian (; ? - 210 BC ) was a Chinese general of the Qin Dynasty under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. His grandfather, Meng Ao, and his father, Meng Wu, were generals as well. After the unification of China, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered Meng Tian leading 300,000 armies to attack the Xiongnu and build the Great Wall of China. Meng Tian was forced by the eunuch, Zhao Gao, to kill himself by drinking poisonous wine after the death of Emperor Qin Shi Haung."
Kippah
A kippah (Hebrew) or yarmulke (Yiddish) is a small cloth cap worn by Jews.
"Traditionally it was worn only by men, but in modern times the push for equality between the sexes in the practice of Judaism has led some women to wear yarmulkes. Some Jews only wear yarmulkes while praying; others wear yarmulkes the entire day, making sure not to walk more than four cubits without head covering (especially outside)."
The basis for wearing a head covering is a story in the Talmud (tractate Shabbat).
"Often, the color and fabric of the ""yarmulke"" can be a sign of adherence to a specific religious movement. The Israeli National Religious community is often referred to by the name ""kipot srugot"" כיפות סרוגות, literally ""woven yarmulkes"". Similarly, some Haredi sects are referred to by the name ""kipot shkhorot"" כיפות שחורות, literally ""black yarmulkes""."
Etymology.
"The etymology of ""yarmulke"" is unclear. Linguists (e.g. Max Vasmer) maintain that the Yiddish word is derived (via Russian or Polish) from the Turkic """", meaning 'raincoat'."
"Traditionally, ""yarmulke"" is considered to have originated from the Aramaic phrase """""" (in awe of the Lord), in keeping with the principle that the yarmulke is supposed to reflect someone's fear of heaven. Or perhaps, ""yira malkah"""" (fear of the King)."
Judeo-Arabic dialects
"Judeo-Arabic languages are a collection of Arabic language dialects spoken by Jews living or formerly living in Arabic-speaking countries. Just as with the rest of the Arab world, Arabic-speaking Jews had different dialects for the different regions where they lived. Most Judæo-Arabic dialects were written in modified forms of the Hebrew alphabet, often including consonant dots from the Arabic alphabet to accommodate phonemes that did not exist in the Hebrew alphabet."
"In retaliation for 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jews in Arab countries became subject to increasingly insufferable discrimination and violence, causing virtually all of them to flee en masse to Israel. Their dialects of Arabic did not thrive in Israel, and most became extinct, replaced by the Modern Hebrew language."
"In the Middle Ages, Jews in the Islamic diaspora spoke a dialect of Arabic, which they wrote in a mildly adapted Hebrew script (rather than using Arabic script)."
This phenomenon is called Judaeo-Arabic and may be compared to both Ladino (Judaeo-Spanish) and Yiddish (Judaeo-German).
"Some of the most important books of medieval Jewish though were originally written in Judaeo-Arabic, as well as certain halakhic works and biblical commentary. Only later were they translated into medieval scientific Hebrew so that they could be read by the Ashkenazic Jews of Europe. These include:"
The Clangers
"The Clangers is a British children's television series. The first episode was broadcast on the BBC on 16 November 1969. The series is about a family of aliens who live under the surface of the Moon in caves. They looked like small, pink, knitted mice. Other characters include the Froglets and The Soup Dragon, a dragon that gives out soup. The family uses a US flag as a table cloth."
London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham
"The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham is a London borough in West London but is part of an area called Inner London. House prices are more expensive than most parts of England. The borough has three famous football teams: Fulham F.C., Queens Park Rangers F.C. and Chelsea F.C."
1 E9 m²
"1 E9 m² is a term used to group together areas of similar size. It is used for places that are between 1,000 km² and 10,000 km² in area. The term is based from the scientific notation for 1 x 109m²."
"AJ Lee held the Divas Championship 3 times in the WWE, successfully retaining her title at WrestleMania XXX. the night after on 'Raw' she was defeated and lost her title to NXT Woman's Champion, Paige. On the June 30, 2014 episode of ""Raw"", Lee returned to the WWE. She challenged Paige for the Divas Championship and won her second championship."
"On April 3, 2015, it was announced that AJ decided to retire from the company."
Basset Hound
"The Basset Hound is a short-legged dog, of the hound family. Bassets are used in hunting to detect the scent of game. Their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the Bloodhound."
"The name ""Basset"" comes from French words meaning ""rather low""."
"Basset Hounds usually have coats of brown, black or white and are most often spotted. Sometimes they can be other colors. Basset Hounds have been bred from the nineteenth century. They are said to descend from the Basset d'Artois. Basset Hounds are tall, and can weight up to ."
Alvin Plantinga
"Alvin Plantinga (born November 15, 1932, Ann Arbor, Michigan ) is an American epistemologist, philosopher of religion and professor at the University of Notre Dame. He is a founding member of the Society of Christian Philosophers."
Plantinga's aim in philosophy is to defend believing in God as rational. His epistemology is one that tries to say that knowledge is only possible if you accept the possibility of some form of intelligent design by God.
Acute radiation syndrome
"Acute radiation syndrome (ARS) also known as radiation poisoning, radiation sickness or radiation toxicity, is a syndrome or group of health effects which occur within months of exposure to high amounts of ionizing radiation. The term generally refers to acute (serious, rapid onset) problems rather than ones that develop after a prolonged period. It is mainly damage to the blood, digestive system, and nervous system."
Castorocauda
"Castorocauda was a genus of small, semi-aquatic proto-mammals which lived in the Jurassic period, about 154 million years ago."
"Its fossil was found in lakebed sediments of the Daohugou Beds of Inner Mongolia. ""Castorocauda"" was highly specialized, with adaptations like those of modern semi-aquatic mammals such as beavers, otters, and the platypus (convergent evolution). It is the earliest animal found with fur."
"""Castorocauda"" is one of the near-mammals in a group called the Docodonta."
"Although ""Castorocauda"" was not a crown group mammal, it is important in the study of how mammals evolved. It was the first find with an almost complete skeleton. Also it is not a ""small nocturnal insectivore""."
Element Skateboards
"Element Skateboards (sometimes shortened to Element) is an American company. It is known for making skateboards and swimwear. It was founded in 1992 by Johnny Schillereff. The company is based out of Irvine, California. The company was originally known as Underworld Element Skateboards but Schillereff decided to drop the ""Underworld"" part due to the company being absorbed because of financial problems. The Element company also sponsors professional skateboarders like Bucky Lasek, Bam Margera, Chad Muska, Ray Barbee, Vanessa Torres, Mark Appleyard, Nyjah Huston and"

Gustave Doré
"Paul Gustave Doré (; January 6, 1832 – January 23, 1883) was a French artist, engraver, illustrator and sculptor. Most of Doré's work was wood engraving and steel engraving."
Biography.
"Doré was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante."
"In 1853, Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's ""Don Quixote"". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Doré also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Raven"" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper &amp; Brothers in 1883."
"Doré's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Doré Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from ""The Microcosm of London"" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant &amp; Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid £10,000 a year for the project."
"The completed book, ""London: A Pilgrimage,"" was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Doré paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London."

Joint
A joint is the place where two or more bones make contact. They allow movement (except for skull bones) and give mechanical support.
"Joints have cartilage in between them, which help to make the movement flexible. Joints are described structurally and functionally. Structural classification is how the bones connect to each other; function is the degree of movement between the articulating bones."
Synovial bursa.
"A synovial bursa is a small fluid-filled sac lined by a synovial membrane. It has an inner capillary layer of viscous synovial fluid (bit like raw egg white). The bursa is ""a cushion between bones and tendons"" and/or muscles around a joint. This helps to reduce friction between the bones and allows free movement."
Hosni Mubarak
"Muhammad Hosni Said Mubarak (; 4 May 1928 – 25 February 2020), commonly known as Hosni Mubarak (), was an Egyptian politician. He served as President of Egypt from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011."
Mubarak became the vice-president of the Republic of Egypt after moving up the ranks of the Egyptian Air Force. Then he became the President after President Anwar Sadat was assassinated on 6 October 1981. His almost thirty-year presidency made him Egypt's longest-serving ruler since Muhammad Ali Pasha.
"As President of Egypt, Mubarak is thought to have been one of the most powerful leaders in the region. Under the 1971 Constitution of Egypt, Mubarak exercised strong control over the country and was generally considered a dictator. In 2005, he called an election and easily won it. Many opponents believed Mubarak changed the election results so he could win."
"In early 2011, during the Arab Spring, there were huge protests against his government. In the end, Mubarak resigned and handed over power to the armed forces. It is hoped that elections later that year for a new government. On 2 June 2012, Mubarak was sentenced to life imprisonment for ordering the shooting of protesters in the revolution that ousted him."
"On 13 January 2013, Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned Mubarak's sentence and ordered a retrial. On retrial, Mubarak and his sons were convicted on 9 May 2015 of corruption and given prison sentences. Mubarak was detained in a military hospital and his sons were freed 12 October 2015 by a Cairo court."
He was acquitted on 2 March 2017 by the Court of Cassation and released on 24 March 2017.
"He died on 25 February 2020 at a Cairo hospital after having surgery, aged 91."
Euclid
"Euclid of Alexandria () (about 325 BC–265 BC) was a Greek mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt and worked at the Library of Alexandria. Little is known about this person, but people think he lived there when Ptolemy I was Pharaoh. It is not known where and when he was born."
The Elements.
"Euclid collected together all that was known of geometry, which is part of mathematics. His ""Elements"" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms."
"The ""Elements"" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of ""greatest common divisors"". They were in his ""Elements"". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can fit evenly in both of the two numbers."
"The geometrical system described in the ""Elements"" was long known simply as geometry, and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today that system is referred to as Euclidean geometry to distinguish it from other so-called non-Euclidean geometries which mathematicians developed in the 19th century."
Other works.
Cheongsam
"Cheongsam (长衫) is typical, traditional clothing for Chinese women. Also known as Qipao (Ch'ipau)."
"A cheongsam usually has two long slits at either side of the hem for convenient movement and display of the legs. Unlike a short skirt, the slits of cheongsam show a woman's legs when she walks."
"A more formal description is: a longer, figure-fitting, one piece garment with a standing collar, an asymmetric left-over-right opening (youren) and two side slits."
"The modern Cheongsam was developed in Shanghai in the 1920s. Several alterations have been made to the design. It was popular in China from the 1920s to 1940s, as many noble and high-class women wore it. Although the cheongsam is thought to be traditional Chinese clothing, it is modern."
The traditional Qipao evolved from Manchu women's Changpao during the Qing Dynasty.
Kikuyu
Kikuyu is the largest tribe in Kenya. They are 22% of Kenya's population and are of Bantu ethnicity.
History.
"There are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from. First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia."
"According to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi."
Kikuyu language.
"Members of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is ""Wi mwega?"" which means ""Are you fine?"". There are a few Kikuyu dialects depending on region. Kikuyus from Nyeri, for instance, have other forms of greeting including: ""Wakia Maitu"" greeting an elderly female, ""Wakia Awa"" greeting an elderly male, and ""Wanyua"" for agemates."
"The Kikuyu language is also similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though English and Kiswahili are the main languages spoken in Kenya across tribes, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride."
Famous Kikuyu people.
"Famous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the third president of Kenya), Uhuru Kenyatta (current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)"
Incheon International Airport
"Incheon International Airport is the largest international airport in South Korea where all international flights leave and arrive every day. Gimpo Airport located near city Seoul used to be the international airport for Korea. However as the population grew and needs for places to stay increased in the area, Gimpo Airport no longer could expand its capacity to meet the growing demands for international flights. To solve the problem, a construction plan for a new 24 hour airport was started in 1992. Incheon International Airport is in Incheon City Jung-gu Unseo-dong (37°27′5″N, 126°26′4″E). Incheon International Airport Railroad (A'REX) and Incheon International Airport Highway were built to join the airport to Seoul. The airport is operated by Incheon International Airport Corporation (IIAC) and it is owned by the government of South Korea."
History.
"Incheon International Airport opened on March 29th, 2001. It was built on reclaimed land between Yongjongdo and Youngyudo. First stage of building started in 1992 and it took eight years and four months to finish. It cost 7.8 trillion Won. This allowed Incheon International Airport to have up to 170,000 flights, 27,000,000 passengers and 1,700,000 tons of cargo per year. Stage Two began in 2002 and was completed on June 20th 2008. The airport now has the capacity of holding 410,000 flights, 44,000,000 passengers, and 4,500,000 tons of cargo per year. When the airport is finished in 2020, it will have two passenger terminals, four satellite concourses, 128 gates, and four parallel runways. It will be able to have up to 100 million passengers, and 7 million tons of cargo per year."
Facilities.
"Incheon International Airport has passenger facilities (main passenger terminal, passenger concourse A), cargo terminal complex (A, B, C terminal), and operation facilities (control tower, runways, and meteorological facilities)."
Lao language
"Lao or Laotian is a language and is the official language of Laos. It is also spoken in the northeast part of Thailand. Lao, like the other languages of Laos, is written in an abugida writing system. The languages has variations, but the Vientiane dialect is considered the standard written form of Lao."
"Lao and Thai are both Tai languages and are very similar to each other. In fact, speakers of northern Thai dialects and Lao claim that they can largely understand each other, making the dialects mutually intelligible."
History.
"Lao is one of the Tai languages, spoken in what is now northern Vietnam and southern China. Mongol invaders and expansion in China pushed the Tai people south towards India. Their language was influenced by other languages in the region like the Mon-Khmer and the Austronesian languages. The written form of Lao originally came from the Pali language in India. The script form was brought to the region by Buddhists about two thousand years ago."
Vocabulary.
"in 1972 Gene Simmons together with guitarist Paul Stanley are the band Kiss, Gene and Paul join the band the musicians Ace Frehley on guitar and Peter Criss on drums and vocals. One of the characteristics of the band were his outlandish makeup and costumes. In 1973 Kiss; Paul Stanley guitar and voice, Gene Simmons bass and voice, Ace Frehley in lead guitar released their first album Kiss"", Gene composed the hit ""Strutter"" with Stanley, and ""Deuce"" two of the biggest hits of the band. Kiss recorded their second album Hotter Than Hell, released in October 22, 1974. In 1975 the band released the third album Dressed to Kill, with the theme Rock and Roll All Nite, the most successful of the band, written by Simmons and Stanley.

In 1983 Kiss appears without makeup on the cover of the album Lick It Up, the band had changed their style of Hard Rock for the Heavy Metal style. For 1984 released the album Animalize, another powerful album of Heavy Metal. Mark St. John as lead guitarist, was incorporated in replacing Vinnie Vincent. Mark left the band in 1985 and was replaced by Bruce Kulick, who would maintain the lead guitar until 1997. In 1989 Gene recorded with Kiss one of their best album Hot in the Shade, with two of the best tracks from the band ""Hide Your Heart"" and Forever.

Fox News
The Fox News Channel (commonly known as Fox News) is an American 24-hour cable and satellite television news network. It was made by Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes. It is owned by . the channel was officially launched in 1996.
Shows.
"The channel plays up to 15 hours of live shows every day. 6 hours of these are opinion shows. The hosts of its opinion shows are Sean Hannity, Neil Cavuto, Greta Van Susteren, and Tucker Carlson introduced to the network by Group CEO Gerard Bevan along with Geraldo Rivera. Fox News Network leans right-wing, but has some liberals (such as Greta van Susteren)."
Criticisms.
"There was a documentary called ""Outfoxed"" that criticized the channel because they say it is biased towards conservatives and the US Republican Party in its reporting. Fox says its opinion shows are conservative but its regular news programs are not. President Barack Obama, through a spokesperson, accused Fox News of working for the Republican Party. Fox has also been accused of having a right-wing bias, racism, discrimination, race baiting and gender inequality. Roger Ailes has called Fox News ""the balance"" against the liberal networks news groups such as ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, Cable News Network, and MSNBC."
Omsk
"Omsk is a city in Russia in the Siberia region, capital of Omsk Oblast. As of the census in 2010, Omsk had been declared one of the cities in Russia with over 1 million people. Omsk is close to the border of Kazakhstan."
Omsk is the only one city in the world which has Metro with only one station.

Question mark
"The question marker (?), also referred to as the question point, question stop, question sign, interrogation marker, interrogation point, interrogation stop, mystery marker, mystery point, mystery stop, mystery sign, query or eroteme or the question mark, interrogation mark or mystery mark for short, is a punctuation mark that is used at the end of a sentence when asking a question."
"The symbol is thought to come from the Latin quæstio, meaning ""question"", which was shortened to Qo. The uppercase Q was written above the lowercase o, and this mark was turned into the symbol that we use today."
"Another guess about where question mark comes from says that it comes from the 9th century, when it was a point followed by the curved part written slanted."
"Some writers put a space between the end of their sentence and the question mark. This is thought to come from a French practice and is called French spacing. In French a space is always put before question marks, exclamation marks, colons, and semicolons. In English, however, using this space is thought of as bad form. Some English books do have these spaces, but are often a very thin space, which are not full spaces but an attempt to make the words easier to read."
"The river plain which was the heart of the wetland stretched across Pangaea 5000 km from eastern Canada to the Ukraine, and was 700 km wide.p6 This would make the Pennsylvanian basin larger than any wetlands on Earth today."
Change of climate.
"The rainforest system collapsed about halfway through the Pennsylvanian, and was replaced by a cooler, drier climate."
"The wetland forests ended when the land level was raised by the pressure of the Gondwana continent against Laurussia, causing the zone of contact to be raised. The end of the Coal Measures marks the end of the Carboniferous period. China was too far away to be affected, and there the wetland forests continued for another 50 million years, into the early Permian.p30"
Structure.
"""Lepidodendron"" had tall, thick trunks that rarely branched and were topped with a crown of bifurcating branches bearing clusters of leaves. These leaves were long and narrow, similar to large blades of grass, and were spirally-arranged."
The closely packed diamond-shaped leaf scars left on the trunk and stems as the plant grew provide some of the most interesting and common fossils in Carboniferous shales and accompanying coal deposits. These fossils look much like tire tracks or alligator skin.
"The scars, or leaf cushions, were composed of green photosynthetic tissue, evidenced by the cuticle covering and being dotted with stomata, microscopic pores through which carbon dioxide from the air diffuses into plants. Likewise, the trunks of ""Lepidodendron"" would have been green, unlike modern trees which have scaly, non-photosynthetic brown or gray bark."
"""Lepidodendron"" has been likened to a giant herb. The trunks produced very little, if any, wood. Most structural support came from a thick, bark-like region. This region remained around the trunk as a rigid layer that did not flake off like that of most modern trees. As the tree grew, the leaf cushions expanded to accommodate the increasing width of the trunk."
"The branches of this plant ended in cone-like structures. ""Lepidodendron"" did not produce seeds like many modern plants. Instead, it reproduced by means of spores."
Stigmaria.
"Stigmaria are a type of branching tree root fossil found in Carboniferous rocks. They were the roots of coal forest lycopsid trees such as ""Sigillaria"" and ""Lepidodendron"". Each trunk had four of those roots. ""Stigmaria"" is a ""form taxon"", as the genus and species of the plant bearing the root cannot be identified."
DuPont
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (often DuPont) is an American chemical company. Eleuthère Irénée du Pont founded it in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill. DuPont was the world's third largest chemical company based on market capitalization and ninth based on revenue in 2009. Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
"In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the cooling industry and later, more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair."
"Some of DuPont's trademarked brands have become genericized. For instance, “neoprene” was originally intended to be a trademark, but quickly came into common usage."
Melendi
"Ramón Melendi Espinosa (born 21 January 1979 in Oviedo, Asturias) is a Spanish pop and rumba singer. He studied in the school, Leopoldo Alas ""Clarín"" with the Formula 1 pilot Fernando Alonso. He wrote a song for him called ""Magic Alonso""."
Career.
"In 2003, Melendi made his first album ""Sin noticias de Holanda"" which had 12 songs. In December of the same year, he wrote two new songs, ""Asturias"" and ""Moratalá"", which were very successful. In 2004, one of his songs, ""Con la luna llena"", was chosen as the official song of a Spanish bicycling event called ""La vuelta ciclista España"". One year later, he made his second single album ""Que el cielo espere sentao"". He sold more than 200,000 copies of it. Some years later he made three more albums."
Melendi sings in concerts around Spain and South America.

Description.
The two species of marsupial moles are rare and poorly understood burrowing mammals of the deserts of Western Australia.
"The word “free” in “free software” means ""freedom"", not ""price"". People are allowed to sell Free software, but the person who buys the software can change it, give it away or sell it too."
"The words “free software” are sometimes used in English to just mean software that can be downloaded without paying money, which is confusing. Sometimes this software lets people make their own copies for other people, however it may not let people do all the things that they can do with real Free software, such as change it or sell it. In this case “free” means “free of charge”. To make the difference more clear, software that does not cost money should be called freeware; it is almost always proprietary software."
1812
1812 was a leap year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar.
Zookeeper
"A zookeeper is a worker in a zoo, responsible for the feeding and daily care of the animals. As part of this, they clean the exhibits and report signs of bad health. They may also be involved in scientific research, and in public education, conducting tours or simply answering questions put by members of the public."
"Qualifications and pay of zookeepers both vary widely. A junior keeper in a small zoo may have no qualifications other than an affinity for the job, while a senior keeper in a large zoo would most probably have both a relevant college degree and extensive experience."
"Generally, a liking for animals and outside work and willingness to undertake moderate and sometimes dirty physical work are required. Many animals are themselves heavy and strong-smelling, as is the food some of them eat. Handling such is part of the job at times."
Cage
"A cage is a box which is made to keep something inside of, without it being able to get out (such as an animal). Cages are usually made of many metal bars."
"A cage which has birds in it is called a ""birdcage""."
Toddler
"A toddler is a very young child who is learning how to use their hands, stand and walk, and also how to communicate with others."
Most children are toilet trained while they are toddlers.
"Even when toddlers can walk, they are often transported in a stroller, buggy, or pushchair when the walk is a long distance or when they're tired. Toddlerhood typically begins after age one and is over by the time the child is 4, but this can differ depending on the child."
Ronald McDonald
Ronald McDonald is an American clown character who is a mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
"He wears yellow and red stripes and has wacky hair. He lives in McDonaldland, with lots of his friends. The first actor to play Ronald McDonald was famous weatherman and Bozo the Clown actor Willard Scott. Later the actor for Coco the Clown, Michael Polakovs, redesigned Ronald McDonald's outfit and make-up, which is the version still used by today's Ronald McDonald actors. The fictional character is a heroic magical adventurer that stands up good and freedom, such as saving the rain forest and supporting Ronald McDonald House Charities."
Actors.
"McDonald's has many actors employed to portray Ronald McDonald in restaurants and events. It is assumed, however, that the company uses only one actor at a time to play the character in television commercials."
This is a list of these main actors:
"An actor by the name of Joe Maggard stated in an interview of The Guardian in 2014 that he portrayed the Ronald McDonald character from 1995 to 2007. However, It was stated in a 2003 article by The Baltimore Sun that Maggard was only a stand-in actor for one commercial shoot in the mid 90s and stated that ""he is definitely not Ronald McDonald"", as Jack Doepke and David Hussey were the real current portrayers as Ronald throughout the time period Joe claimed he did. In 1998, he was charged of carrying a weapon in the New Hanover County, N.C., McDonalds and the next year he was convicted in making harassing telephone calls posing as Ronald. The judge ordered him to take anger management classes."
Bob Marley
"Robert Nesta ""Bob"" Marley (February 6, 1945 - May 11, 1981) was an important Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician in the 1970s and 1980s. He made the style of reggae music very popular all over the world. His music told stories of his home and the Rastafarian religion that he followed. Some songs were about religion and some songs were about politics like Get Up Stand Up."
"Bob Marley was born on February 6, 1945 in Nine Mile, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica to a black teenager, Cedella Booker, and a white man named Norvall Marley. When he was young, his friends gave him the nickname, ""Tuff Gong"". He started his music career in the 1960s with his group the Wailing Wailers (or simply the Wailers), that he formed with two friends, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. In 1962, Bob Marley and the Wailing Wailers recorded their first two songs called ""Judge Not"" and ""One Cup of Coffee""."
"Bob married Rita Anderson in 1966 and she joined the group as a back-up singer. They had five children together. One is Ziggy Marley, who is also a well-known reggae performer."
Fifth war.
"In 1574, the fifth war began. The Catholic monarchy faced an alliance between the Protestants and a new group, known as the ""Malcontents,"" Who were were Catholic noblemen who opposed the policies of the monarchy and wanted religious toleration for the Protestants. In 1575, King Henry III's younger brother, Francis, known as the Duke of Alençon, joined the Malcontents and raised an army. Henry III gave up and in 1576 agreed to a peace treaty with the Malcontents and Protestants. Called the Peace of Beaulieu, gave a lot of land and money to the Duke of Alençon and to the Malcontents. Many of the Malcontents, including Alençon, were satisfied and became loyal to the King and the Catholics again."
Sixth war.
"In late 1576, the sixth war began. The Protestants no longer had as many allies and lost the important cities of La Charité and Issoire. However, the King did not have enough money to continue the war and defeat the Protestants totally and so the war ended in 1577."
Seventh war.
"The seventh war began in 1580 when Henry of Navarre, the most important Protestant leader, attacked the Catholic city of Cahors. He conquered the city, but the Catholics captured the Protestant city of La Mure later that year. In November 1580, another peace treaty was signed."
"In 1584, the Duke of Alençon died. King Henry III was the only living son of King Henry II (reigned from 1547 to 1559), and the next man in line to become king was the Protestant Henry of Navarre. Many Catholics wanted King Henry III to disown Henry of Navarre and to make someone else the heir to the throne because were scared of a Protestant becoming king, but Henry III refused."
Eighth war.
"In 1585, the Catholics, led by Henry of Guise, raised an army and forced King Henry III to outlaw Protestantism in France. The war that followed, the eighth war, is also known as the ""War of the Three Henrys"" and is named after King Henry III, Henry of Guise, and Henry of Navarre. Even though Henry III and Henry of Guise were on the same side in 1585, many Catholics feared that Henry III secretly wanted Henry of Navarre to be the next king. In 1588, the supporters of Henry of Guise, known as ""Leaguers,"" chased King Henry III out of Paris. In 1589, afraid that Henry of Guise wanted to take the throne from him, Henry III had him murdered, fled to the Protestant army, and joined forces with Henry of Navarre. Charles of Mayenne, Henry of Guise's brother, became the leader of the Leaguers."
"The Royal-Protestant army defeated the Leaguers at the Battle of Senlis and surrounded Paris. Before they could capture the city, King Henry III was killed by a Leaguer but named as his heir Henry of Navarre, a Protestant, before he died. The King if France was now Henry IV, who defeated Leaguer armies at the Battle of Arques (1589) and the Battle of Ivry (1590) but could not completely defeat the Leaguers. In 1593, King Henry IV converted to Catholicism."
End.
"After six more years of fighting, the Leaguers gave up, and the war ended. Henry IV pardoned those who had fought against him, and made a settlement allowing Catholics and Protestants to practice their faith within certain limits."

She was on the covers of French Elle and Vogue Italia. She was the first model for Mango's plus-size line, Violeta by Mango. She designed a swimwear line."
Barkhad Abdi
"Barkhad Abdi (born 10 April 1985) is an actor from Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was born in Somalia. He has a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. He also has an Oscar nomination for his role in the movie ""Captain Phillips""."
Streptomyces
"Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria. ""Streptomyces"" is often found in soil and is very much similar to fungi by its shape. They form long thin threads called hyphae that can differentiate into a chain of spores for reproduction. Almost all of the bioactive compounds produced by ""Streptomyces"" are made while the hyphae are forming from the substrate mycelium."
Use in medicine and science.
"Streptomyces are medically important, as they produce antifungals, antiparasitic drugs, antivirals, antitumorals, anti-hypertensives, immunosuppressants and antibiotics. Different species of streptomyces are used to produce different antibiotics. Over 500 species of ""Streptomyces"" bacteria have been described. For example, widely studied ""S. griseus"" was the first to be used in production of an antibiotic streptomycin, while ""S. avermitilis"" as a source of avermictin. Another well-studied species, ""S coelicolor"", is widely used in genetic studies. Overall, Streptomyces produce over two-thirds of the clinically useful antibiotics of natural origin, such as tetracycline, neomycin and chloramphenicol."
Antibiotic mechanism.
"Antibiotics target essential proteins for pathogens’ growth and survival, inhibiting essential functions. For example, streptomycin, which is made from ""S. griseus,"" irreversibly binds to bacterial genetic material and causes errors in the production of new proteins, which leads to cell death. It can be used for treating severe infections, such as tuberculosis and plague. Another example is avermectin, made from ""S. avermitili."" It causes invertebrate paralysis (inability to make and pass nerve impulses), which is used as a drug and pesticide against parasitic worms and insects. Avermectin enhances glutamate (neurotransmitter) at the glutamate-gated chloride channels that mammals don’t possess. It causes the excess of chloride ions inside the cell (hyperpolarisation), so the action potential cannot be further induced, ultimately leading to paralysis."
Antibiotic resistance.
Examinations.
The RCO offers five qualifications or diplomas.
ARCO
"ARCO (short for Atlantic Richfield Company, the original name) is a United States oil company. It has operationsn 2 in the United States, Indonesia, the North Sea, and the South China Sea. As of July 2011, it had more than 1,300 gas stations in the western part of the United States."
ARCO's original parent companies included:
"The two companies merged in 1966, and bought Sinclair Oil Corporation in 1969. In 1978, ARCO opened its first ampm convenience store."
"Between 1970 and 2000, ARCO had a complicated corporate history. By 1985, it sold its Eastern US business to a new Atlantic Petroleum. In 2000, the remaining Western US business was bought by British Petroleum (BP). Finally, in 2013, BP sold ARCO and the Carson Refinery to Tesoro for $2.5 billion."
Oil discovery.
"In 1957, Richfield was the first to drill for oil in Alaska. On July 15 of that year they struck oil with their first well. It was the first major oil discovery in Alaska and tested at 900 barrels a day. In 1968 they partnered with Exxon for Alaska North Slope oil production. In 1980, they were the seventh largest oil company in the United States."
Skating
Skating refers and involves any sport or recreational activity that involves traveling on dry surface or ice using skates.
"There are many varieties of skating, such as:"
Economic bubble
"An economic bubble happens when a market goes through a very fast inflation of value. This increase is followed by a quick decrease in value, called a ""crash"" or a ""bubble burst"". Economic bubbles can be caused by many things, but many economists believe that economic bubbles are related to inflation. An economic bubble can cause an economic crisis due to a loss of investment both by companies and individuals, such as the Great Depression or the Economic crisis of 2007-2010."
"An economic bubble occurs due to the human psychology of an expectation of an unlimited demand for any particular commodity. The market moves up quickly as the investors see an increase in prices due to increase in demand. Prices may eventually fall when supply increases beyond the demand, resulting in the bursting of the bubble. Predicting when this will happen is difficult, hence it may surprise investors."
Population without double counting
Population sans doubles comptes is a phrase in French that means population without double counting in English.
"In France, because of the census, the INSEE has allowed people who live in one place and study in a different place to be counted twice, so as to show how the population moves. Because of this, each commune in France has many numbers of how many people live in it. For example, students may be counted where they study and where they live but do not study (the place they were born in). It is just like allowing students in the United States to vote in the town election of the place they are studying in and the town election where they were born."
Glass transition
The glass transition is the transition of amorphous solids from a hard and brittle state into a molten or rubber-like state. An amorphous solid that goes through a glass transition is called a glass. Supercooling a viscous liquid into the glass state is called vitrification.
"The glass transition temperature ""T""g is always lower than the melting temperature, ""T""m, of the crystalline state of the material, if one exists. Above a glass transition temperature, a plastic is rubbery. Below the glass transition temperature, a plastic is solid. Thermosets, or thermo-setting plastics, burn up before they reach their melt temperature, but most thermosets also undergo glass transition."
Uncle Tom's Cabin
"Uncle Tom's Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly is an anti-slavery novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe. It was published in 1852. It greatly influenced many people's thoughts about African Americans and slavery in the United States. It also strengthened the conflict between the Northern and Southern United States. This led to the American Civil War. The book's effect was so powerful that Lincoln said when he met Stowe at the beginning of the Civil War, ""So this is the little lady who made this big war."""
"The main character of the novel is Uncle Tom, a patiente sentimental novel showed the effects of slavery. It also said that Christian love is stronger than slavery."
"""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" was the most popular novel of the 19th century, and the second best-selling book of the century (the first one was the Bible). It helped abolitionism spread in the 1850s."
"In these days, it has been praised as a very important help to anti-slavery. However, it has also been criticized for making stereotypes about black people."
"Caracas is the capital city of Venezuela. Santiago de Leòn de Losada founded the city in 1567. It is where Simon Bolivar was born. The city has nearly 6 million people, who live in the metropolitan area. Caracas is the center of the economical activity of the country and also hosts the main government offices of Venezuela."
"After WW2 the city has experienced a huge growth, thanks to the oil revenues of the country. Nearly half a million Europeans immigrated to the city in the 1950s ( that had in those years only one million inhabitants) and so Caracas developed a typical western-European look in the new modern areas."
Sports.
All the best teams of the sports done in Venezuela are concentrated in the metropolitan area of Caracas. Between those teams we have:
Buildings.
Many beautiful modern buildings can be seen in the city. Here there are some of them:
Homestar Runner
"Homestar Runner, also called H*R, is an Internet surreal comedy cartoon that was made using Adobe Flash. It usually gets updated every Monday (but, except for an update on April Fools' Day of 2014 and a few cartoons since, it has not been actively updated since December 2010) with a cartoon, a game, or a Strong Bad Email. The people that made the website are Mike Chapman and Matt Chapman. They are brothers and are called The Brothers Chaps. The cartoons on the website normally show Homestar Runner or Strong Bad, who are the main characters on the cartoon."
Video games.
"Telltale Games, the makers of video games based on the Sam &amp; Max comic book, made a game called ""Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People"" for Windows and the Wii's WiiWare. It's an episodic game with five episodes, and it is made with 3 dimensions instead of 2 dimensions like Homestar Runner is. The first episode was called ""Homestar Ruiner"", and ended with ""8-Bit is Enough""."
Horst Köhler
"Horst Köhler (born 22 February 1943) is a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union. He was President of Germany from 2004 to 2010. He was the candidate of the two Christian Democratic sister parties, the CDU and the CSU, and the liberal FDP, for becoming president. Köhler was elected to his first five-year term by the Federal Assembly on 23 May 2004. He was reelected to a second term on 23 May 2009. About one year later, on 31 May 2010, he resigned from his office in a controversy over his comment on the role of the Bundeswehr in light of a visit to the troops in Afghanistan."
"Köhler is an economist by profession. Prior to his election as president, Köhler had a career in politics, the civil service and as a banking executive. He was President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development from 1998 to 2000. He also served as the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from 2000 to 2004."
"Although the office of President is less influential than that of the Chancellor and is mostly concerned with ceremonial matters, Köhler was a highly popular politician during his term. He has called for more influence for the President and has suggested the President should be directly elected. This was the case under Germany's Weimar Constitution."
Early life.
"Köhler was born in Skierbieszów (later named Heidenstein), in the General Government area of German-occupied Poland. He was the seventh child of Elisabeth and Eduard Köhler. His family were Bessarabian Germans from Rîşcani in Romanian Bessarabia (near Bălţi, present-day Moldova). Horst Köhler's parents had to leave their home in Bessarabia in 1940. As part of the Generalplan Ost, they were resettled in 1942 at Skierbieszów. This was a village near Zamość, Poland (then part of the General Government). When the Wehrmacht was pushed back during World War Two, the Köhler family fled to Leipzig. In 1953, they left the Soviet Zone to escape from the communist regime. The family lived in refugee camps until 1957. Then, they settled in Ludwigsburg. Horst Köhler hence spent most of his first 14 years as a refugee."
Studies and military service.
"A teacher proposed that the refugee boy should apply for the Gymnasium. Köhler took his ""Abitur"" in 1963. After a two-year military service at a Panzergrenadier battalion in Ellwangen, he left the Bundeswehr as reserve officer. He studied and finally earned a doctorate in economics and political sciences from University of Tübingen. There, he was a scientific research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research from 1969 to 1976."
Career in the civil service.
"Köhler joined the civil service in 1976, when he was employed in the Federal Ministry of Economics. In 1981, he was employed in the Chancellery of the state government in Schleswig-Holstein. He served there under Prime Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg. In 1982, Köhler was made head of the Ministers office in the Federal Ministry of Finance. He rose to head of department in 1987, with responsibility for financial policy and federal industrial interests. In 1989, he became head of the department for currency and credit."
Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
"He is a member of the CDU since 1981. He was Secretary of State in the Federal Ministry of Finance from 1990 to 1993. In that capacity, he served as a ""sherpa"" (personal representative) for Chancellor Helmut Kohl, preparing G7. He also served as the primary German negotiator in the Maastricht Treaty negotiations."
Career in banking 1993–2000.
"Between 1993 and 1998 he served as President of the association of savings banks in Germany. In 1998, he was appointed president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He settled in London, where the headquarters of the bank is located."
Head of the International Monetary Fund.
"Köhler was appointed managing Director and Chairman of the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2000. The government of Gerhard Schröder nominated him. This was because their first nominee, Caio Koch-Weser, was rejected by the United States."
"He lived in Washington, D.C., from 2000 to 2004."
President of Germany.
"On 4 March 2004, Köhler resigned his positions, because he was nominated as presidential candidate. Köhler defeated Gesine Schwan on the first ballot by 604 votes to 580. 20 votes were cast for minor candidates, while one elector was absent because of a heart attack. Köhler succeeded Johannes Rau as president on 1 July 2004, for a five-year term. Germany's presidency is a largely ceremonial office. However, it is also invested with considerable moral authority. From 2004 until early 2006, Charlottenburg Palace was the seat of the President of Germany. This was because Schloss Bellevue has been renovated."
"Upon his election, Köhler said that ""Patriotism and being cosmopolitan are not opposites"". Presenting his visions for Germany, Köhler also said that ""Germany should become a land of ideas""."
"In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency. During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal. Carter said that many places like ""Love Canals"" existed across the country. He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was ""one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era""."
"In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia."
Economy.
"Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president. He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession. His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth. In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs."
"The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose. Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down. There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis."
"Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed. The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety."
"In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States. This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s."
Healthcare.
"During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country."
"Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal, and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage. Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid. The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate, and later was not approved in the House."
"During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House. Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress."
Education.
"Carter worked with Congress to create an education department. In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments. On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department. On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education."
"Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families. In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas."
Foreign policies.
Peace treaties.
"In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty. The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999. This would remove United States control of the canal. The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal. The treaty was not popular with conservatives."
"In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David. The two agreements were signed at the White House. The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty."
Africa.
"Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries. Carter later said his plans for wanting ""to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe"" and to end racial issues like apartheid."
"Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country. He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria. Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia."
"On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia."
Iran hostage crisis.
"In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran."
"In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran. The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution. 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981. They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president. During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days. In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence. On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely. On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people."
Soviet Union.
"On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing. During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean. On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues. These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979."
"Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978. Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September. By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country. This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan. Carter was surprised by the invasion. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous. Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union. He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union. Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union. In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen. The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989."
South Korea.
"In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea. He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea. Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials. In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops. From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House."
1980 presidential election.
Democratic primary challenge.
"Bailey represented Doctor Sam Sheppard on appeal after Sheppard was convicted of murdering his wife. Bailey managed to get Sheppard a retrial, in which Bailey was successful in getting Sheppard acquitted. Bailey was the lead lawyer in successfully defending in the court martial for the My Lai Massacre. Bailey, along with others, successfully defended O. J. Simpson in the trial where Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown."
"In 2014, the Maine State Bar Association and the Maine Supreme Judicial Court denied Bailey's petition to have his law license reinstated."
"Bailey died in Atlanta, Georgia on June 3, 2021, one week before his 88th birthday."
Stuffed animal fetishism
"Stuffed animal fetishism (or ""plushophilia"") is a sexual attraction to stuffed animals. People who have this fetish are sometimes called ""plushies"". People who have a stuffed animal fetish are sometimes thought of as furries."
Albert Einstein Square
"Albert Einstein Square (, ""Kikar Albert Einstein"") is a public square in Jerusalem, Israel. it is located in the entrance of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities at the Talbiya neighborhood in Jerusalem."
Albert Einstein visited Palestine in 1923 for 12 days. He gave the first lecture at the Mount Scopus campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
"Einstein was in favor of the Hebrew University, as well as Zionism and education in general. This is the reason the square is named for him. Also, a statue of Einstein is nearby in the gardens of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities."
Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Ratified on February 3, 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment (Amendment XVI) to the United States Constitution allows the Congress to impose a federal income tax. This allows the federal government to collect a tax on personal income, no matter where that income came from. The Sixteenth Amendment overturned the 1895 Supreme Court landmark decision in ""Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co"". In ""Pollock"", the Court ruled that a 2 percent tax on incomes over $4,000 was unconstitutional. This was because the law the ruling struck down did not allow for apportionment, the court ruled against it. The Sixteenth Amendment allowed Congress to levy a uniform direct income tax without being subject to apportionment."
Background.
"When the framers of the Constitution were determining how the new government would be funded, they were trying to avoid a tax based on a person's income. In the Constitution, Article one, Sections 2 and 9 created the ""rule of apportionment"". On a practical basis this required Congress to tax the states based on each state's population instead of a tax on each person's income or property. For example, if a state made up four percent of the total population, they would be required to pay four percent of the total federal tax. The framers of the Constitution expected direct taxes to be used and defined the term broadly. However, they did not see that apportionment would cripple any attempt to collect direct taxes."
"Before 1913, the bulk of federal revenues came from indirect taxes on goods. These include tariffs on goods imported into the country. They also included excise taxes on items like whiskey. Income taxes were not new in 1913. Congress had passed the Revenue Act of 1861 during the Civil War to help pay for the war. Ten years later it was allowed to lapse. The Confederate States of America also had an income tax. Starting in 1863, the tax exempted the first $1,000 and charged a 1% tax on the first $1,500 over the exemption. A 2% tax was levied on all income over that amount."
"In 1894, Congress passed the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act which included a flat rate federal income tax of 2 percent. A year later, the Supreme Court handed down their decision in ""Pollock v. Farmers' Loan &amp; Trust Co."". They ruled the tax unconstitutional because it was a direct tax and not apportioned to the population of each state."
A constitutional income tax.
"On June 16, 1909, President Taft sent a message to the Senate which read:"
"After a debate on the floor of the House lasting five hours, the bill was passed 314-14 (1 vote as ""present"" and 55 not voting). It was then sent to the state legislatures for ratification. The amendment gave Congress the power to apply a direct tax, based on people's incomes, and not subject to the apportionment rule."
Effects of the Sixteenth Amendment.
"The largest and most direct effect of the passage of the Sixteenth Amendment was it shifted power from the states to the national government. States had income taxes before the national government did. This kept the national government weaker due to having less revenue than the states. Without the Sixteenth Amendment, the national government would find it far more difficult to extend its military power to other parts of the world."
Def Jam Vendetta
"Def Jam Vendetta is a 2003 professional wrestling video game published by Electronic Arts and developed by AKI Corporation and EA Canada. It was released for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube. ""Def Jam Vendetta"" was released on March 31, 2003 in North America, May 23, 2003 in PAL regions, and on August 21, 2003 in Japan. It featured hip hop musicians from the Def Jam Records label as fighters. The engine for the game was first designed for a sequel to EA's ""WCW Mayhem"", but EA lost their WCW license when WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 2001."
Reception.
"IGN rated the game a 8.9 out of 10. Jon Robinson of IGN said that the multiplayer was ""smooth"" and ""slick"". GameSpot rated the game 8.4 out of 10. Alex Navarro of GameSpot said ""As a wrestling game, Def Jam Vendetta manages to succeed on most every level, providing surprisingly deep gameplay, quality graphics and sound, and a distinctive atmosphere""."
Hassan al-Turabi
"Hassan 'Abd Allah al-Turabi (c.1932 – 5 March 2016) was a Sudanese religious and Islamist political leader in Sudan. He has been called ""one of the most important figures in modern Sudanese politics"". He was born in Kassala, Sudan. Al-Turabi was leader of what was called the National Islamic Front (NIF). He served as Speaker of the National Assembly serving from 1996 through 1999. He later served as Secretary General of the Popular Congress Party from 1999 until his death in 2016."
"Al-Turabi died in Khartoum, Sudan on 5 March 2016. He was aged 84."
His importance in English music.
"Some of Vaughan Williams’s best works are those where he makes his music sound like folk song. He loved the poetry of Housman and used some of the poems in a song cycle called ""On Wenlock Edge"" for tenor, piano and string quartet. His music always sounds English. He was born in the 19th century which was a time when people thought English musicians were not very good. Vaughan Williams and Edward Elgar (who was a little older) made people realise that it was possible for an Englishman to write beautiful, moving music."

Recycling
"Recycling is when you recover scrap or waste and reprocessing the material into useful products. Glass, paper, plastic, and metals such as aluminum and steel are often recycled. Dead plants, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through composting."
"It is important not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out."
"Recycling reduces trash in landfills and incinerators. Another reason people recycle is to reduce the amount of raw materials and energy used in making things. Most of the time, it takes less energy to recycle trash than to throw it away, ""The Economist"" says. Recycling can reduce your carbon footprint and it can help to minimize the whole size of landfills around the world."
"The 3 R's are Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle."
Plastic recycling.
"Most people make about two kilograms of waste (trash) every day, and about 7% of this waste is made up of plastic products that can be recycled. Today, plastic can be recycled into products like picnic tables, park benches, and even high-chairs."
Sort it out.
"First, plastic is collected and taken to a recycling center, where it is ""sorted out"". When plastic is sorted out, symbols have to be printed on every recyclable plastic product used. There are two types of plastic: ""polyethylene"" and ""polymer"". There are two kinds of polyethylene plastic, too: ""high density polyethylene"" (HDPE), and ""low density polyethylene"" (LDPE). HDPE plastic is usually used to make furniture, and LDPE plastic are usually things like milk jugs, plastic and grocery bags."
Grinding washing.
"HDPE plastic is ground into a small powder. LDPE plastic, which are usually thin films, need to be ground by a special machine. After that, both plastics are washed with hot water and detergent. Dirt and other things, like labels, are taken off. After the wash, the powder is dried with hot air."
"Sometimes, the powder is sold. But other times, the powder is heated, colored, and then put into a ""pelletizer"". The pelletizer makes the powder into little pellets, which are bought by a company that shapes the pellets into pieces of plastic ""wood"". This plastic wood is used to make flowerpots, trash cans, pipes, picnic tables, benches, toys, mats, and many other things."
Transnistria
"Transnistria, Transdniestria, or Pridnestrovie, officially the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR; ), is a de facto country in Eastern Europe. It came to be between 1990 and 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Transnistria declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria. There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a ""frozen conflict"" area. Currently, no state recognises Transnistria, officially the territory is part of Moldova."
"There is argument about whether Transnistria is really a country or not. It is recognized by three other unrecognized or partly recognized states: Abkhazia, Nargorno-Karabakh Republic, and South Ossetia. The area continues to claim independence, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from foreign countries."
"In a vote on 17 September 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova, which calls the area the ""Territory of the Left Bank of the Dniester""."
Transnistria is the only state to still use the hammer and sickle symbol on its flag.
"Russia has a big influence on the territory. Between 1.500 and 2.000 Ruassian soldiers are stationed on the territory. In addition, there may be up to 10.000 paramilitary troops."
"Moldovans, Russians, and Ukraians make up about a third of the population each."
Mercalli intensity scale
"The Mercalli intensity scale (or more precisely the Modified Mercalli intensity scale) is a scale to measure the intensity of earthquakes. Unlike with the Richter scale, the Mercalli scale does not take into account energy of an earthquake directly. Rather, they classify earthquakes by the effects they have (and the destruction they cause). When there is little damage, the scale describes how people felt the earthquake, or how many people felt it."
"Very often, non-geologists use this scale, because it is easier for people to describe what damage an earthquake caused, than to do calculations to get a value on the Richter scale."
Values range from I - Instrumental to XII - Catastrophic.
"Giuseppe Mercalli (1850-1914) originally developed the scale, with ten levels. In 1902, Adolfo Cancani extended the scale to include twelve levels. August Heinrich Sieberg completely rewrote the scale. For this reason, the scale is sometimes named Mercalli-Cancani-Sieberg scale, or MCS scale."
"Harry O. Wood and Frank Neumann translated it into English, and published it as Mercalli–Wood–Neumann (MWN) scale. Charles Francis Richter also edited it. He also developed the Richter scale, later on."
Tie votes.
"Normally, appellate courts (or panels) are staffed with an odd number of judges to avoid a tie vote. Sometimes and in some jurisdictions, when judicial positions are vacant or a judge has recused (excuse) himself or herself from the case, the court may be stuck with a tie. In this situation the decision of the lower Court stands."
Writ
"In English common law, a writ is a formal written order issued by a body with administrative or judicial jurisdiction. In modern use this generally is a court. Writs are issued by courts directing the person to whom they are addressed to do something or to not do something. Writs may also be used to direct other courts or public authorities. The authority for a court to issue a writ is given by the All Writs Act which is a United States federal statute originally a part of the Judiciary Act of 1789."
History.
"In its earliest form a writ was simply a written order made by the English king to a specified person to undertake a specified action. For example in the feudal era a military summons by the king to one of his tenants-in-chief to appear dressed for battle with his knights at a certain place and time. An early usage survives in the United Kingdom. Also in Canada in a writ of election. This was is a written order issued on behalf of the monarch (in Canada, the Governor General) to local officials (High Sheriffs of every county in historical UK) to hold a general election. Writs were used by the medieval English kings to summon persons to Parliament."
Types of writs.
There have been a great many kinds of writs. Some of the more common types still in use are:
Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution
"The Eleventh Amendment (Amendment XI) to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress on March 4, 1794 and ratified by the states on February 7, 1795. It deals with each state's sovereign immunity and was adopted to overrule the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in ""Chisholm v. Georgia""."
Lawsuits against states.
"The idea of sovereign immunity originated in English common law. It was also proposed by political theorists like Thomas Hobbes and Jean Bodin. The founding fathers of the Constitution were aware of the traditional doctrine that states were immune from private lawsuits. Several Anti-Federalists were afraid that Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, which declares that the federal judicial power extends to suits ""between a State and Citizens of another State"", would override that doctrine."
"The Eleventh Amendment was a direct reaction to an unpopular ruling by the Supreme Court in ""Chisholm v. Georgia"" (1793). In ""Chisholm"" the Court said federal courts had the power to hear lawsuits brought by citizens against US states. Also, that states were not immune to these cases. The Eleventh Amendment reversed this decision and does not allow cases brought against a state by a citizen of another state or country. It says nothing about a citizen bringing a suit against their own state."
"In ""Ex parte Young"", the Supreme Court decision allowed suits in federal courts against officials acting on behalf of states of the union to proceed despite the State's sovereign immunity, when the State acted unconstitutionally."
The Eleventh Amendment is one of five amendments that overturned earlier Supreme Court decisions.
Johnnie Cochran
"Johnnie L Cochran, Jr. (October 2, 1937 – March 29, 2005) was an American lawyer. He is best known for his part in the acquittal of O. J. Simpson for the murder of Simpson's ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. Cochran also represented many different celebrities and victims. Cochran became known as an early advocate for the victims of police brutality. Cochran helped Sean Combs win an acquittal after being indicted on stolen weapons charges and bribery in 2001. After the case, he decided to retire."
"On March 29, 2005, Cochran died from a brain tumor in his home in Los Angeles, aged 67."
Crypt
"A crypt is a room, or group of rooms, underneath a church where bodies are put after a person dies. It usually has coffins, religious items, and other trinkets for the dead."
Pokémon Sun and Moon
"are two role-playing video games. They are published by The Pokémon Company and developed by Game Freak. They were released for the Nintendo 3DS. The games were released on 18 November 2016 in North America, Australia and Japan, and 23 November 2016 in Europe, commemorating the ""Pokémon"" franchise's 20th anniversary."
"On February 25, the games' existence was leaked after the trademarks were found on the EU's Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market's website. ""Sun"" and ""Moon"" were officially announced in a Pokémon Nintendo Direct."
Story.
"Pokémon Sun and Moon take place in a region called Alola. Alola has warm weather and is made up of four large islands. The player is given a Pokémon and goes on a journey around Alola. The player can catch and raise other Pokémon as they explore. While exploring, the player sometimes has to fight Team Skull. Team Skull are a group of people who want to destroy things and cause trouble. And some Pokémon have a special Alolan form!"
Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern
"Boyd was a photographer on the trip over the Arctic Ocean in 1941. The crew on the trip to the Arctic called her the ""Ice Woman""."
Boyd was the first person to fly over the North Pole. She did this in 1955.
"She was born in San Rafael, California. She died in San Francisco."
Ranulph Fiennes
Sir Ranulph Twistleton-Wykeham-Fiennes (born 7 March 1944) is an English explorer.
"Fiennes was born in Windsor, Berkshire. He was educated at Eton College."
"Fiennes wrote many books. He wrote 'The sett','Mad,bad and dangerous to know' , 'The secret Hunters' and much more."
"Fiennes has led over 30 expeditions. Ranulph did the first unsupported walk across Antarctica. Fiennes holds many records for his 52,000-mile expedition. It ended successfully on August 29, 1982. Fiennes is the only man alive ever to have travelled around the Earth's circumpolar."
He became an English explorer after joining the armed forces.
Fiennes was brought up in South Africa and lived in England for the rest of his life. He climbed Mount Everest successfully in 2009.
State ratifying conventions
State ratifying conventions are one of the two ways established by Article Five of the United States Constitution for ratifying proposed constitutional amendments. Ratifying conventions have only been used on one occasion. This was in 1933 and was used to ratify the 21st Amendment. All other proposed constitutional amendments have been offered to the state legislatures for ratification.
"The Constitution also provides that state ratifying conventions may also be used to propose a constitutional amendment. However, to date, none of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by state conventions. A state ratifying convention may be called by a two-thirds vote by a state legislature."

Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution
"Validated on December 5, 1933, the Twenty-first Amendment (Amendment XXI) to the United States Constitution canceled the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and ended the Prohibition Era in the United States. It is the only Amendment to repeal another amendment. It is also the only Amendment to have been ratified by state ratifying conventions rather than by state legislatures."
Background.
"The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution had started a period in the US known as Prohibition. During this time the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Passage of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919 was the chief goal of the temperance movement. but it soon proved highly unpopular. Crime had soared under Prohibition as gangsters, such as Chicago's Al Capone, became rich from a very profitable black market for alcohol. The federal government was unable to enforce the Volstead Act. In 1932, wealthy industrialist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. stated in a letter: As more and more Americans opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, a political movement grew for its repeal. However, repeal was complicated by grassroots politics. Although the U.S. Constitution provides two methods for ratifying constitutional amendments, only one method had been used up until that time. This was ratification by the state legislatures of three-fourths of the states. However, the wisdom of the day was that the lawmakers of many states were either obligated to or simply afraid of the temperance lobby. For that reason, when Congress formally proposed the repeal of Prohibition on February 20, 1933, it chose the ""other"" ratification method established by Article V. That is by state conventions."
Implementation.
State and local control.
"The second section bans the importation of alcohol in violation of state or territorial law. This has been interpreted to give states essentially absolute control over alcoholic beverages. Many U.S. states still remained ""dry"" (with state prohibition of alcohol) long after its ratification. Mississippi was the last, remaining dry until 1966. Kansas continued to prohibit public bars until 1987. Many states now delegate the authority over alcohol granted to them by this Amendment to their municipalities or counties (or both), which has led to many lawsuits over First Amendment rights when local governments have tried to revoke liquor licenses."
Ritz Crackers
Ritz Crackers are a brand of snack cracker. They were introduced by Nabisco in 1934. They are disc-shaped and lightly-salted.
"Ritz Crackers varieties include the Original Ritz, Low Sodium Ritz, Honey Butter Ritz, Whole Wheat Ritz and Honey Wheat Ritz."
"Sydney Stern chose the name Ritz. The name appealed to people who went through the difficulties of the Great Depression by offering them ""a bite of the good life."""
Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS
"HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), the virus caused by AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) and is one of the most serious public health challenges in the world. However, the world is committed to preventing new HIV infections and ensuring that everyone living with HIV has access to HIV treatment. In 2019, an estimated 170 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, since 2010, the number of new HIV infections fell by 23%. For example, in one year, this is different from the number of people diagnosed with HIV in one year. Worldwide, about 81 percent of people living with HIV know their HIV status in 2019. The remaining 19% (about 710 million people) still need access to HIV testing services. Important way HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services."
HIV/AIDS pandemic by continent.
Africa.
"HIV/AIDS is a major concern epidemic in Africa and cause of death in many parts of Africa. Although the continent contains about 15.2% of the world's population, Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for about 69% of HIV patients, and 70% of all AIDS deaths in 2011. In the North African countries have the lowest prevalence rates, as their populations usually share cultural patterns that reduce the spread of the disease, in contrast to what the desert countries did in Africa. Southern Africa is the most affected region on the continent. As of 2011, HIV has infected at least 10% of the population in Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe."
Europe.
"AIDS cases in most countries in Western Europe have fallen to levels not seen since the initial outbreak; many people attribute this trend to active education campaigns, blood transfusion screening and increased condom use. In addition, since new AIDS treatments have proven to be effective (even if expensive) methods to suppress HIV, Western Europe’s AIDS mortality rate has also fallen very much in the past few years. There are many ways to transmit HIV, including paid sex, sex between men, injecting drugs, mother-to-child behavior, and heterosexual behavior. However, many new infections in this area have occurred through contact with HIV-infected people in other areas. The prevalence of adults (15-49 years old) in the region is 0.3%, and there are currently 570,000 to 890,000 HIV-infected persons. Due to the availability of antiretroviral therapy, the number of deaths from AIDS has remained low since the trough in the late 1990s. However, in some countries, there is still a large number of undiagnosed HIV, and the evidence of resistance to antiretroviral drugs in some newly infected people in the region is worrying. In addition, the risky behaviors of men who come into contact with men have recently increased."
Asia.
"As of 2008, 4.7 million people in Asia were infected with HIV. The United Nations believes that the epidemic in Asia peaked in the mid-1990s, and that the annual rate of HIV infection subsequently decreased by more than half. Regionally, the epidemic has remained fairly stable since the 2000s."
North America.
"In 2016, it was estimated that 1.5 million adults and children were infected with HIV / AIDS in North America, excluding Central America and the Caribbean. 70,000 adults and children are newly infected each year, with an adult prevalence rate of 0.5%. 26,000 people die of AIDS in North America each year."
South America.
"At the beginning of 2018, there are almost about 1 million people living with HI /AIDS in South America. By the number of its population, Brazil is the country with the most HIV-positive people with 830,000 people. As of April 2018, Chile is the country with the most infections. While the Falkland Islands are the only territory where no cases were detected. The biggest problem that exists is discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS in less developed countries. This is due to ignorance of the disease, with outdated premises and the high religious population by influenced to other people."
Oceania.
"In this region, the national conditions regarding HIV and AIDS vary greatly. Part of the reason is the distance between the major islands in Oceania. The extensive development of the region also plays an important role. It is estimated that the prevalence of between 0.2 to 0.7 percent, there are currently 45,000 to 120,000 adults and children living with HIV. Papua New Guinea is one of the worst AIDS epidemic in the region. According to UNAIDS, since 1997, HIV cases in the country at a rate of 30% per year, by the end of 2006, HIV prevalence in the country is about 1.3% from the population."
Sybil (cat)
"Sybil (2006 – 27 July 2009) was a cat living at 11 and 10 Downing Street. Named after ""Sybil Fawlty"" from the television show ""Fawlty Towers"", she was the pet of then Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling."
"When introduced in September 2007, Sybil, who was black and white, was the first cat at Downing Street since Humphrey was reportedly removed in November 1997, due to Cherie Blair's aversion to cats. In January 2009, she returned to Edinburgh."
Saint Sarah
"Saint Sarah, also called Sara e Kali (Sara the Black) is a patron saint of the Romani people of Catholicism Faith. She was born in the 1st century into a family of Indian Saint Thomas Christians of South India who went as Merchants to Roman Egypt. According to legends, Saint Sarah sailed from Egypt to France in a boat with the Three Marys. Her day of honour is on May 24."
Baba Fingo
Baba Fingo or Father Fingo is a male Deity in Turkish Romani folklore. The Romanlar in Turkey believe in Baba Fingo as their Saviour. The festival Kakava is celebrated at Edirne on 5-6 May. The Romanlar make a Bonfire and go to the Meric River in the night. They believe Baba Fingo comes out of the water and protects the Romani people.
"The legend of Baba Fingo says that long ago, the people lived in Egypt. But the Pharaoh was cruel to them. So Baba Fingo led the people out through the Red Sea. Another legend says that Baba Fingo was a good and wise commandant who worked for Pharaoh, but he liked women and alcohol too much. The Pharaoh's other commandants were jealous of him. They tricked him with women and alcohol and he got lost in the river. Although the Romanlar have been quasi-Muslims for centuries, the popular Folk belief in Baba Fingo plays a very important role for them."
2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami
"The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami was a 9.0-magnitude earthquake followed by tsunami waves. It was measured at 8.4 on the JMA seismic intensity scale The earthquake happened off Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, on the east coast of the Tōhoku of Japan, on March 11, 2011 at 05:46:23 UTC. It was at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 miles). It was the most powerful earthquake to hit Japan in recorded history. It was also the fourth most powerful earthquake on Earth since modern record-keeping began in 1900."
"On 10 February 2015, the Japanese National Police Agency report confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing."
Earthquake.
"Days before the main earthquake, there were several foreshocks. The biggest one was a 7.2 magnitude earthquake on 9 March, about from the main earthquake's location."
The United States Geological Survey said the centre of the earthquake was from Tokyo. A 7.7 aftershock happened 30 minutes following the first quake. There have been more than 600 aftershocks bigger than magnitude 4.5 or more.
"The earthquake damaged buildings and started fires. The Shinkansen high speed bullet trains were stopped and Haneda Airport was closed after the quake. Various train services around Japan were also stopped. Hundreds of flights to Japan were cancelled due to the earthquake and tsunami, affecting many people. A large fire broke out at an oil refinery in Ichihara, Chiba prefecture."
"The nuclear power plants shut down automatically. At first the Japanese Prime Minister said that no radioactive material leaked. About 51,000 people were moved away from the nuclear reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in Fukushima city when its cooling system failed. There are fears that the nuclear reactor might meltdown."
Tsunami.
"The earthquake started a tsunami warning for Japan's Pacific coast and other countries, including New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Mariana Islands (USA) and Taiwan. The tsunami warning issued by Japan was the most serious on its warning scale. It warned that the wave could be as much as 10 meters high. A 0.5 meter high wave hit Japan's northern coast. Kyodo news agency reported a four-metre-high tsunami hit the Iwate Prefecture in Japan. Miyagi Prefecture was flooded, with waves carrying buildings and cars along as they travelled inland. In some areas the waves reached 10 km inland."
"At 9:28 p.m (HST) the National Weather Service issued a tsunami warning until 7 a.m. for all of Hawaii. Tsunami waves were expected to arrive in Hawaii at 2:59 am local time. A wave two meters high reached California, after travelling across the Pacific Ocean at a speed of 500 kilometres per hour. A man in California was drowned after being swept into the ocean while trying to take a photograph of the tsunami wave."
Effects.
Deaths–Injured–Missing.
"The Japanese National Police Agency has officially confirmed 15,890 deaths, 6,152 injured, and 2,590 people missing across 18 prefectures, as well as over 126,000 buildings damaged or destroyed."
Nuclear disaster.
"The Fukushima nuclear disaster began on March 11 2011, just hours after the initial wave. The connection to the electrical grid was broken. All power for cooling was lost and reactors started to overheat. There was a partial core meltdown in reactors 1, 2, and 3; hydrogen explosions destroyed the upper part of the buildings housing reactors 1, 3, and 4; an explosion damaged the containment inside reactor 2; fires broke out at reactor 4. Despite being initially shutdown, reactors 5 and 6 began to overheat. Spent nuclear fuel rods stored in pools in each reactor building overheated as water levels in the pools dropped. The accident is the second biggest nuclear accident after the Chernobyl disaster, but more complex as all reactors are involved."
"There were 4.4 million households that had their electricity supply cut off, including 11 nuclear power plants."
Geophysical impact.
"The quake moved parts of northeast Japan as much as closer to North America, making parts of Japan's land ""wider than before,"" according to geophysicist Ross Stein. Areas of Japan closest to the epi-center shifted the most."
"The Pacific plate itself may have moved westwards by up to . Other estimates put the amount of slippage at as much as , covering an area some long by wide. If confirmed, this would be one of the largest recorded fault movements to have been associated with an earthquake."
"According to Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, the earthquake shifted the Earth's axis by . This deviation led to a number of small planetary changes, including the length of a day and the tilt of the Earth. The speed of the Earth's rotation increased, shortening the day by 1.8 microseconds due to the redistribution of Earth's mass."
"The axial shift was caused by the redistribution of mass on the Earth's surface, which changed the planet's moment of inertia. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, such changes of inertia result in small changes to the Earth's rate of rotation. These are expected changes for an earthquake of this magnitude."
Transport.
"The Tōhoku Expressway, which serves northern Japan, had to be closed due to cracks on the roads. The whole railway network was closed, but was reopened hours after the earthquake. Up to 100,000 people were stuck waiting for a ride straight out of the city."
Television broadcast.
"In response to the great disaster, Emperor Akihito directly addressed his subjects in a television broadcast. This was the first time any emperor had used television in this way."
Other help.
"There were other people from other countries helping people after this disaster. For example, Google set up a people finder service, which allowed users to ask for or post information about missing people."

"Many industrial power plants burn fossil fuels to get their energy. However, burning fossil fuels can make a lot of oxides (chemical compounds that have oxygen and other elements inside). In fact, the burning of fossil fuels makes 96% of the sulphur oxides in the atmosphere. Some industries also make chemicals that make poisonous fumes (smoke)."
Indoor air pollution.
"Air pollution is not only on the outside. Homes, schools, and buildings can also have air pollution. Sometimes the air inside a building is even worse than the air outside. Many things which humans use every day can pollute the air. Compounds inside carpets, paints, building materials and furniture also pollute the air, especially when they are new."
"In buildings where the windows are tightly shut to stop air leaks, the air inside can be polluted more than the air outside."
Acid precipitation.
"Acid precipitation is precipitation, like rain, sleet, or snow, that contains acids from air pollution. When fossil fuels are burned, they let out oxides into the air. When these oxides mix with water in the atmosphere, they make acid, which fall as precipitation. Acid precipitation can kill living things like fish and trees, by making the place where they live too acidic. Acid rain can also damage buildings made of limestone and concrete."
Ozone hole.
"A global concern is the hole in the ozone layer in the stratosphere. The Earth's ozone layer protects life from the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays, but in the 1970s, scientists found out that some chemicals let out into the atmosphere makes the ozone turn into oxygen. This lets more ultraviolet rays reach the Earth. During the 1980s, scientists found that the ozone layer above the South Pole had thinned by 50 to 98%."
Human health.
"On March 17, 1992, in Mexico City, all children under the age of 14 could not go to school because of air pollution. This does not often happen, but being exposed to air pollution every day can make people have many health problems. Children, elderly (old) people, and people with allergies especially, can have a lot of problems because of air pollution. Studies from the University of Birmingham showed that deaths because of pneumonia and air pollution from motor vehicles like cars are related."
The World Health Organization said that 2.4 million people died because of the direct problems of air pollution. Some of the problems include:
Agricultural effects.
"In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels. There can also be increased yield of crops due to some air quality conditions."
Louis-Antoine de Bougainville
"Louis-Antoine de Bougainville was an admiral and navigator from France. In 1766 he was sent by his government to make a trip around the world, called ""circumnavigation"", which took from 1766 to 1769. He rediscovered (found again) the Solomon Islands in 1768 (the largest island is named for him). He also collected plants and made a trustworthy chart of some parts of the center of the Pacific Ocean. Bougainville saw a part of the Great Barier Reef, but could not find Australia."

Gerardus Mercator
"Gerardus Mercator, also called Gerhard Kremer, and born Gérard de Crémère (1512 – 1594), was a Flemish geographer and mathematician from Belgium. He explored Flanders and made globes about the earth and the sky. He became one of the best mapmakers of the 16th century. The Mercator projection that has his name is a flat map projection of the features of the surface of the earth that can be seen and made only mathematically. It was found to be excellent for navigating on oceans and is still used today. In 1585 he began a great atlas that was later finished by his son. His last years he used for studying theology."
Mercator was born in Rupelmonde and died in Duisburg.

The number of countries that make up the United Kingdom is often the subject of debate. In decreasing order of area they are:
"The United Nations and UK government says that the United Kingdom is officially made up of 2 countries (England and Scotland), one principality (Wales) and one province (Northern Ireland). However, Wales has not formally been a principality since the 16th century with the . In 2011 the International Organization for Standards Wales the status of country to clear ambiguity and avoid further confusion, thus the first statement may be corrected to 3 countries and 1 province."
Nucleophilic aliphatic substitution.
Grignard reagents are nucleophiles in nucleophilic aliphatic substitutions for instance with alkyl halides in a key step in industrial Naproxen production:
Elimination.
"In the Boord olefin synthesis, the addition of magnesium to certain β-haloethers results in an elimination reaction to the alkene. This reaction can limit the utility of Grignard reactions."
Grignard degradation.
"Grignard degradation at one time was a tool in structure identification (elucidation) in which a Grignard RMgBr formed from a heteroaryl bromide HetBr reacts with water to Het-H (bromine replaced by a hydrogen atom) and MgBrOH. This hydrolysis method allows the determination of the number of halogen atoms in an organic compound. In modern usage, Grignard degradation is used in the chemical analysis of certain triacylglycerols."
Industrial use.
An example of the Grignard reaction is a key step in the industrial production of Tamoxifen. (Tamoxifen is currently used for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer in women.):
Peach (disambiguation)

Giant Magellan Telescope
"The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) will be the world's largest telescope when it is completed in 2025. Instead of one large mirror, the GMT will have seven separate mirrors working together. This will mean its collecting area is bigger than the actual mirror surfaces. It will be made of seven diameter mirror parts. It will have a the resolving power of a mirror. Its collecting area will be the same as a mirror. The telescope will have over four times the ability to gather light than existing telescopes. It will produce images up to ten times clearer than the Hubble Space Telescope. It will cost $700 million."
Planned site.
"The location of the telescope is the Las Campanas Observatory, which is also the site of the Magellan Telescopes, some northeast of La Serena, Chile. This area has clear weather for most of the year. The night sky in most of the surrounding Atacama Desert region is free from atmospheric pollution. With few cities nearby this is probably one of the places least affected by light pollution. All of this makes the area one of the best spots on Earth for long-term astronomical observation."
Design details.
"The telescope is unique because it will use seven mirror sections, each in diameter. These segments will then be arranged to form a single optical surface. This is difficult as the surface of the outer six mirror segments is not radially symmetrical (that is, they are off-axis). This requires a small change in the way mirrors are usually polished. All seven mirrors will be arranged so that the reflecting surface of each of them is on a common axis. One mirror will be in the center and the other six arranged symmetrically around the center. A focal plane will be on-axis with the entire assembly. The plan is to build seven identical off-axis mirrors. The spare mirror has been made to replace a mirror when it needs recoating, a 1–2 week (per segment) process required every 1–2 years."
"The Steward Observatory, at the University of Arizona, is making the mirrors in a laboratory beneath the university's football stadium. It is using a rotating furnace to make the mirror. The casting of the first mirror was completed on November 3, 2005. But the time-consuming shaping and polishing will be completed in the autumn of 2011."
The telescope will make use of adaptive optics.

Stinging nettle
"Stinging nettles (""Urtica dioica"") are a type of plant which have stinging defensive hairs on the leaves and stems. Stinging nettles can be found in America, Europe and Asia."
Sting mechanism.
"The hairs inject histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation when contacted by humans and other animals. Soaking stinging nettles in water or cooking removes the stinging chemicals from the plant, which allows them to be handled and eaten without injury."
Usage.
"The plant has been used as medicine, food, tea and fibre. Nettles are sometimes used in cheesemaking, as nettle soup or as substitute for spinach. Its stems contain a bast fibre that is used for the same purposes as linen. Nettles have been used to make clothing for 2,000 years."
Ecology.
"Stinging nettles are important food plants for several butterflies, like the peacock butterfly and the small tortoiseshell. Also some deers and other animals eat the plant, preferred the leaf shot."
"In 1994, Bush made his first run for office, losing the election for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent Lawton Chiles. Bush ran again in 1998 and defeated Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the vote. He ran for reelection in 2002. He won with 56 percent to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor. During his eight years as governor, Bush helped create environmental improvements, such as conservation in the Everglades, supporting caps for medical malpractice litigation, moving Medicaid recipients to private systems, and creating reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice."
Bush was a candidate for the Republican nomination in the 2016 presidential election.
Early life.
"Bush was born in Midland, Texas. He was raised in Houston, Texas. His father is George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States and 43rd Vice President of the United States. His mother is Barbara Pierce. The nickname ""Jeb"" is made up of his initials J.E.B. (John Ellis Bush)."
"Bush received poor grades at first and occasionally smoked marijuana. He made the honor roll by the end of his senior year and served as captain of the tennis team. He studied at the University of Texas at Austin. At the age of 17, Bush taught English as a second language and worked in the building of a school in Ibarrilla, a small village outside of León, Guanajuato, Mexico/ It was part of a student exchange summer program. While in Mexico, he met his future wife, Columba Garnica Gallo."
Early career.
Florida Secretary of Commerce (1987-1988).
"Following his father's successful run for Vice President in 1980, he moved to Florida and pursued a career in real estate development. In 1986, Bush was named Florida's Secretary of Commerce, a position he held until his resignation in 1988 to help his father's successful campaign for the Presidency."
1994 gubernatorial run.
"In 1994, Bush made his first run for office. He lost the election for governor by less than two percentage points to the incumbent Lawton Chiles."
Governor of Florida (1999-2007).
Bush ran again in 1998 and beat Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay with 55 percent of the vote. Bush's administration was marked by a focus on public education reform.
"While Governor, Bush reduced taxes by $19 billion, reduced the size of state government by 6.6 percent, and vetoed $2 billion in new spending. Bush eliminated civil service protection for over 16,000 state jobs, which had the effect of making it easier to fire employees in those positions."
"Bush signed legislation to restore the Everglades as part of an $8 billion project in conjunction with the federal government. Bush supported more than a dozen new protections for gun owners. In 2005, Bush signed into law Florida's stand-your-ground law, which was the first such state law in the United States. In 2004, Bush supported an unsuccessful bill to allow illegal immigrants to be issued drivers licenses by the state."
He ran for reelection in 2002 and won with 56 percent to become Florida's first two-term Republican governor.
"During his eight years as governor, Bush was credited with initiating environmental improvements, such as conservation in the Everglades, supporting caps for medical malpractice litigation, moving medicaid recipients to private systems, and instituting reforms to the state education system, including the issuance of vouchers and promoting school choice."
2016 presidential race.
Bush was considered a potential candidate in the 2016 presidential election since the end of the 2012 election.
"At a press conference on April 16, 2013, at Bluefield College, Bush stated he had not begun the decision-making process about a run but that he would begin to consider a run soon. On October 2, 2014, Bush's brother George said that his brother ""wants to be President"". On December 16, 2014, Bush announced via Facebook that he would be ""actively exploring"" a 2016 run to become President of the United States and at the end of the year resigned several corporate boards."
"Bush announced his candidacy on June 15, 2015. Bush was high on Republican polls for president in June, but slipped as he lost to Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and to Marco Rubio. After losing the Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina caucuses, Bush suspended his campaign on February 20, 2016."
Personal life.
"Bush married Columba Bush in 1974. They have three children: George, Noelle, and John."
"In 1995, Bush converted from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism. In 2004, he became a Fourth Degree Knight of Columbus. Bush, a member of Father Hugon Council 3521 in Tallahassee, has joined Father Hugon Assembly."
Auckland
Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand. About 2 million people live in the . For a short time in New Zealand's history it was the capital city. Now Wellington is the capital city.
"Auckland is in the north of the North Island. It is on two harbours: the Manukau and Waitemata harbours. It is known as the ""City of Sails"" because there are many sailing boats in the city. The Hauraki Gulf has many different islands and provides safe anchorage and good sailing that is recognised around the world. It has a temperate oceanic climate (""Cfb"" in the Köppen climate classification)."
"Auckland is built on a series of dormant volcanos. The youngest and largest of these is called Rangitoto. Rangitoto is an island just a few kilometres from the city centre. It has many pohutukawas, native trees also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because of their brilliant red flowers which bloom in December."
"In 2010, Len Brown became the 1st Mayor of Auckland. In 2016, he was replaced by Phil Goff."
Climate.
"According to the NIWA, Auckland has a subtropical climate, with warm, humid summers and mild, rainy winters. Under Köppen's climate classification, the city has an oceanic climate (""Cfb""). It is the warmest main centre of New Zealand and is also one of the sunniest, with an average of over 2000 sunshine hours per annum. The average daily maximum temperature is in February and in July. The absolute maximum recorded temperature is , while the absolute minimum is . High levels of rainfall occur almost year–round with an average of per year spread over 136 rain days, but is most frequent in Winter. Snowfall in Auckland is extremely rare; recorded instances include 27 July 1939 and 15 August 2011, although without any accumulation."
"The early morning calm on the isthmus during settled weather, before the sea breeze rises, was described as early as 1853: ""In all seasons, the beauty of the day is in the early morning. At that time, generally, a solemn stillness holds, and a perfect calm prevails..."". Many Aucklanders use this time of day to walk and run in parks."
"The ""New City"" of Jerusalem is the part outside the old stone walls. People started building the new city in the 1800s. Mishkenot Sha'annanim, Mea Shearim, and the Bukharan Quarter are some of the first neighborhoods in the new city."
"After World War I, the Ottoman Empire had been defeated. In June 1922, the League of Nations approved the British Mandate of Palestine. This gave control of the area to the United Kingdom. The land west of the Jordan River was known as Palestine. It was under direct British control until 1948. The land east of the Jordan River was known as Transjordan, and was governed by the Hashemite family. Transjordan gained independence in 1946."
"The mandate in Palestine ended at midnight on 14 May 1948. On the next day, the 1948 Arab–Israeli War began. Israel declared independence, the West Bank was annexed by Jordan, and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip."
"In 1949, at the end of the first Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan. Israel controlled the western part of the city. Jordan controlled the eastern section, including the Old City, a walled section of Jerusalem dating from Biblical times. Israel took control of the entire city during the Six-Day War in 1967."
Jerusalem today is claimed by the state of Israeli as its capital. The United Nations does not agree to Israel saying that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.
Religious significance.
"Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city. Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy."
Jewish.
"According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is where God told the patriarch Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, to Him. The Jews built the Temple, the centre of Jewish worship in ancient times, at the site of Abraham's sacrifice on the Temple Mount in the Old City. Two buildings, one after the other, the First Temple and the Second Temple, stood at the site. The First Temple housed the Ark of the Covenant, a sacred box holding the tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments."
The Western Wall is a part of the Second Temple and Judaism's most sacred shrine. It is a stone wall that strengthened the western side of the Temple Mount in ancient times. The wall is sometimes called the Wailing Wall because of the sad prayers Jewish people said there to mourn the destroyed Temple.
"Other sites in the city that are sacred to the Jews include King David's tomb on Mount Zion, and the Jewish Cemetery and the Tombs of the Prophets on the Mount of Olives, a hill just east of the Old City. Many sites associated with Biblical figures are sacred to Christians, too."
Christian.
"Many monasteries, convents, shrines, and religious seminaries in Jerusalem mark events in the life of Jesus and in the formation of the Christian Church. According to the Bible, Jesus taught in Jerusalem and performed numerous miracles there. The Last Supper supposedly took place in a room known as the Cenacle (also called Coenaculum) on Mount Zion. The Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the Old City is said to be the place of Jesus's Crucifixion (called Calvary or Golgotha), as well as His burial and resurrection. Several Christian sects own the church, which was originally built by Constantine the Great, then rebuilt and dedicated by the Crusaders in 1149 CE. The building stands at the end of the Via Dolorosa (Way of Sorrows), believed to be the path over which Jesus carried His cross to Calvary. Jesus was last seen by His followers on the Mount of Olives before He went up to heaven. All of these sites attract many religious pilgrims each year."
Islamic.
"Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. According to Muslim tradition, Muhammad originally selected Jerusalem as the qibla: the direction Muslims should face during prayer. However, he later told his followers to face Mecca instead of Jerusalem when praying. Muhammad is said to have gone up to heaven from a stone now covered by a golden-domed shrine called the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock and the ancient Al-Aqsa Mosque are among the holiest sites in Islam. They are the main buildings on the Temple Mount, which Muslims call ""Haram al-Sharif"" (Noble Sanctuary)."
Architecture.
"Jerusalem's architecture is a mixture of old and new. The Old City contains architectural examples from each major period in the city's history. Many ancient historical sites and places of worship stand near modern shopping centers and industrial zones. Architecture from the late 1800s and early 1900s shows European influences. Usefulness rather than style characterizes new apartment buildings constructed by the government as housing for immigrants. Many buildings, old and new, have matching exteriors because all construction is required to be faced with a cream-colored limestone called Jerusalem stone, produced by nearby quarries."
Religion in Jerusalem.
Belz Beis HaMedrash HaGadol is the largest synagogue in Jerusalem.
Rocky Mountains
"The Rocky Mountains (often called The Rockies) are a range of mountains in the western United States and Canada. They stretch from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. The Rocky Mountains are more than 3,000 miles long (4,800 kilometers)."
"The highest point in the Rocky Mountains is Mt. Elbert. Mt. Elbert is 14,433 ft tall (4,401m)."
"The Rocky Mountains are relatively new, formed from 55 million to 80 million years ago (mya) during the Laramide orogeny. North America began to move westwards as Pangaea broke up. A number of tectonic plates began to slide under the North American plate. The angle of subduction was shallow, resulting in a broad belt of mountains running down western North America. Since then, further tectonic activity and erosion by glaciers has sculpted the Rockies into dramatic peaks and valleys."
"The rocks in the Rocky Mountains were formed long before the mountains were raised. The oldest rock is Precambrian metamorphic rock that forms the core of the North American continent. There is also Precambrian sedimentary argillite, dating back to 1.7 billion years ago. During the Paleozoic, western North America lay underneath a shallow sea, which deposited many kilometers of limestone and dolomite."
"In the southern Rocky Mountains, near present-day Colorado, these ancestral rocks were disturbed by mountain building about 300 mya, during the Pennsylvanian. This mountain building produced the ancestral Rocky Mountains. They consisted largely of Precambrian metamorphic rock forced upward through layers of the limestone. The limestone had been laid down in a shallow sea. The mountains eroded throughout the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic, leaving extensive deposits of sedimentary rock."

Brooklyn is one of the five boroughs of New York City. It also covers the same area as Kings County. Brooklyn is the second largest borough in land area.
"In the early 21st century, about 2.5 million live there. This is more than in any of the other four boroughs."
Brooklyn is the west end of Long Island. The East River separates it from Manhattan in the north. Brooklyn's only land boundary is with Queens in the east. Jamaica Bay separates Brooklyn from Rockaway in the south. The Narrows separates Brooklyn from Staten Island in the west.
"Coney Island is the south end of Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Museum is near the middle of Brooklyn, near Prospect Park."
Many of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology. They were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society.
Racism.
"Some people have tried to use evolution to support racism. People wanting to justify racism claimed that certain groups, such as black people, were inferior. In nature, some animals do ""survive"" better than others, and it does lead to animals better adapted to their circumstances. With humans groups from different parts of the world, all evolution can say is that each group is probably well suited to its original situation. Evolution makes no judgements about better or worse. It does ""not"" say that any human group is superior to any other."
Eugenics.
"The idea of eugenics was rather different. Two things had been noticed as far back as the 18th century. One was the great success of farmers in breeding cattle and crop plants. They did this by selecting which animals or plants would produce the next generation (artificial selection). The other observation was that lower class people had more children than upper-class people. If (and it's a big if) the higher classes were there on ""merit"", then their lack of children was the exact reverse of what should be happening. Faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse."
"The idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics. The name was proposed by Francis Galton, a bright scientist who meant to do good. He said that the human stock (gene pool) should be improved by selective breeding policies. This would mean that those who were considered ""good stock"" would receive a reward if they reproduced. However, other people suggested that those considered ""bad stock"" would need to undergo compulsory sterilization, prenatal testing and birth control. The German Nazi government (1933–1945) used eugenics as a cover for their extreme racial policies, with dreadful results."
"The problem with Galton's idea is how to decide which features to select. There are so many different skills people could have, you could not agree who was ""good stock"" and who was ""bad stock"". There was rather more agreement on who should ""not"" be breeding. Several countries passed laws for the compulsory sterilisation of unwelcome groups. Most of these laws were passed between 1900 and 1940. After World War II, disgust at what the Nazis had done squashed any more attempts at eugenics."
Algorithm design.
Some equations can be solved using algorithms that simulate evolution. Evolutionary algorithms work like that.
Social Darwinism.
"Another example of using ideas about evolution to support social action is social Darwinism. Social Darwinism is a term given to the ideas of the 19th century social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Spencer believed the ""survival of the fittest"" could and should be applied to commerce and human societies as a whole."
"Again, some people used these ideas to claim that racism, and ruthless economic policies were justified. Today, most biologists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be applied to social policy."
Controversy.
Some people disagree with the idea of evolution. They disagree with it for a number of reasons. Most often these reasons are influenced by or based on their religious beliefs instead of science. People who do not agree with evolution usually believe in creationism or intelligent design.
"Despite this, evolution is one of the most successful theories in science. People have discovered it to be useful for different kinds of research. None of the other suggestions explain things, such as fossil records, as well. So, for almost all scientists, evolution is not in doubt."

Bedfordshire
"Bedfordshire is a county of England. Its county town is Bedford. It borders Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Buckinghamshire (with the Borough of Milton Keynes) and Hertfordshire. The highest elevation point is 243 m (797 ft) on Dunstable Downs in the Chilterns. The county motto is ""Constant Be"", which is taken from the hymn ""To Be A Pilgrim"" by John Bunyan."
SSSIs.
"There are forty Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Bedfordshire, designated by Natural England. Thirty-five are listed for their biological interest, and five for their geological interest."
"Three of the sites are also National nature reserves, twelve are in the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and eleven are managed wholly or partly by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire."
March 20
"March 20 is usually the first day of spring in the Northern Hemisphere, and the first day of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere."
Fraternities and sororities
"Fraternities and sororities are social groups for college students, though sometimes high schools have them too. They exist mostly in the United States and Europe. The words ""frater"" and ""soror"" are Latin for ""brother"" and ""sister"" and used to show closeness between members. They also denote whether the group is for men or women. Sororities are only for women. Fraternities are only for men. But there are some fraternities for women."
"Fraternities and sororities often have groups at many different schools. Each fraternity or sorority is given two or three Greek letters to call themselves, for example, ΑΦ (Alpha Phi) or ΑΧΩ (Alpha Chi Omega). To tell the difference between groups at different schools, called chapters, each chapter is given another set of Greek letters. For example, a man in the Kappa Sigma fraternity who goes to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette is part of the fraternity's EX (Epsilon Chi) chapter. Chapters sometimes have houses on or near the campus of the college the members attend that members can live in."
Fraternities and sororities often participate in community service.
Joining.
"Fraternities and sororities are often exclusive, meaning people who want to join need to be invited to do so. This is done during a process called ""rushing"". During a rush, people who want to join a chapter will talk to current members. If the member think the person rushing is a good fit for the group, they will get an invitation, called a ""bid"", to join the chapter. If the person rushing accepts, they become a ""pledge""."
"The pledging period is a time when the pledge is not yet a full member, and may leave or be refused membership at any time. Sometimes, members of the chapter will put the pledge through trials. Sometimes they are tests on the history of the fraternity they are trying to join, wearing a badge with the fraternity's letters on it at all times, or performing public service. Sometimes the trials are cruel, dangerous or humiliating. If the trials are cruel, it is called ""hazing"". Hazing is illegal in 44 states."
"After the pledging period, the pledge becomes a full member of the chapter and fraternity or sorority."
Bernese mountain dog
The Bernese mountain dog is a breed of dog from Switzerland.
"These dogs are ""tricolour"", which means their coat of fur is made up of three colors: black, white, and tan. They are gentle, loyal, and good with children. Bernese Mountain Dogs are very large dogs, weighing from 70 to 120 pounds (32 to 54 kilograms) as adults. They were first used to pull carts and worked as all-around farm dogs."
Fire ecology
"Fire ecology is about the effects of fire on the ecosystems where it occurs. The results of fire are studied, and also what causes the fires."
"In many ecosystems, fire helps keep the habitat healthy. Examples of such habitats are the North American prairie and chaparral ecosystems, and the South African savanna. In these ecosystems, fire helps renew the habitat. In theses places, many plants and trees have adapted and need fire to grow well, or for their seeds to germinate and start ecological succession."
"If the fires are stopped, dry wood and dead plants accumulate. Bushes and trees that catch fire easily will start growing. When this area finally does catch fire, it will make the wildfire larger and more damaging, and be harder to control."
"In the United States, campaigns have made people believe that wildfires are always bad for nature. This comes from the old belief that ecosystems grow towards a stable system, and disturbances like fires stop that, and destroy the harmony of nature. But we have since learned that in some areas, fire is needed to make the system work properly; fire also helps biodiversity of many habitats. The plants and animals in these habitats have adapted to protect themselves from fire, and sometimes must have fire to survive."
"Still, fire can kill people or burn down buildings. Now, controlled burns are sometimes done to have fire where it is needed, but don't let it go where it can cause damage to people or their property."
Goldman Sachs
"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., or just Goldman Sachs is an investment banking and securities firm. They are involved with global investment banking, securities, investment management, and other financial services mainly with institutional clients. They are also known to be a primary dealer in the United States Treasury security market."
"2017-Four have Goldman Sachs USD 7.830.000.000 (""deutsch 7,83 Milliarden Dollar"")."
"Startups in which the company or its funds have invested is H2O.ai, , Amount, Striim, PLACE, Unqork, and Enterra."
The Province
The Province is a newspaper that serves the British Columbia province in Canada. The Province was founded in 1898. The paper was bought in 1923 by a Southam family. The newspaper runs daily and is the most read newspaper in the province of British Columbia with The Vancouver Sun coming in second place. The newspaper also had a radio station named CFCB and it relinquished its licence in February of 1940 after the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation told it to.
"""The Province"" and ""Vancouver Sun"" are both owned by Postmedia Network Inc."
Vancouver Sun
"The Vancouver Sun is a newspaper that serves the British Columbia province in Canada. The ""Vancouver Sun"" was founded in 1912. The newspaper runs daily and is the second most read newspaper in the province of British Columbia with The Province coming in first place. The newspaper has the largest newsroom in Vancouver although its staff of reporters has reduced in recent years. The Vancouver Sun is not a part of the Sun Media chain which has newspapers in Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary and Edmonton."
"In an address to a branch of the Arab Ba’ath Party, Aflaq speaks of ""‘the Arab mission’"". This ‘Arab mission’ is to return the Arabs to the greatness they were in the past and to unite the Arab regions to form one nation, also known as pan-Arabism. He says: ""“The experience in which our struggle takes place is that of the Arab nation dismembered into different countries and statelets, artificial and counterfeit; we struggle until we can reunite these scattered members[…]”""""."" According to Aflaq, this mission can only be accomplished through revolution: ""“Our past was a revolution and we will never reach its level or meet with it except through revolution.”"""
Ba'athism in Syria.
The beginning of the Ba'ath party in Syria.
"In the year 1943, the Ba’ath Arab Socialist Party was founded in Syria by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. The two met when they were studying in Paris from 1928 to 1934. The two were already nationalists before they went to study in France. However, it is during their stay in France that they learned about and adopted the ideas of socialism. They returned to Syria to work as teachers and in 1943 started the Ba’ath Arab Socialist Party. Syria became independent from France in 1946 and continued as a democracy. However, Syria still had problems within but also problematic relationships with the surrounding countries. The country was still in chaos and figuring itself out when the army decided to take matters into its own hands in 1949 by overthrowing the government. After this, a series of coups followed in quick succession. In 1958, Egypt and Syria formed a union to become the United Arab Republic. However, Syria decided to separate after 3 years in 1961, because Egypt was too dominant in the union. Throughout the years, Ba'athist ideas had been spreading in Syria and also within parts of the Syrian army. This resulted in a Ba'athist coup in 1963 by army officers. Among these officers was Hafez al-Assad who later in 1970 seized power in Syria."
Syria under the al-Assad reign.
"Hafez al-Assad and his son Basher al-Assad have ruled Syria under the Ba’ath party and their version of the Ba’ath ideology. Hafez al-Assad ruled over Syria from 1970 until his death in 2000. During his reign, many atrocities as well as assassinations took place against those who opposed him. After his death, his son Basher al-Assad succeeded him and to-date rules over Syria. Under his reign, the Syrian Civil War started."
Ba'athism in Iraq.
The beginning of the Ba'ath party in Iraq.
"After the Ba’ath party was established in 1943 in Syria, Ba’athism reached Iraq in the late 1940s and became well known among young university students. In 1951, Fu ‘ad al-Rikabi became the founder and first leader of the Iraqi Regional Branch. The Iraqi Regional Branch was an Iraqi version of the Arab Socialist Ba’ath Party. With time, more students became a member of the Iraqi Ba’ath party. By 1955, its members numbered 300. In 1956, Saddam Hussein became a member as well. On July 17, 1968, the party succeeded in overthrowing the government after a failed coup d'état in 1963, and began its thirty-five-year domination of Iraq."
Important events during the reign of the Ba'ath party.
"After the overthrow in 1968, Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr was appointed as the new president of Iraq. During his reign, he nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), which stimulated the economic growth of the country. In July 1979, Saddam Hussein took over the presidentship of al-Bakr and started his twenty-four-year rulership. In 1980, the Iran-Iraq war emerged, which has seen eight years of severe violence and is notable for the use of chemical and biological warfare. In 1990, Iraq led the invasion of Kuwait, which led to its second major war, namely the Gulf war in 1991. In 2003, the reign of Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath party came to an end when the United States led the invasion of Iraq, also known as the start of the Iraq war."
Post-Ba'ath era.
"In May 2003, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) recognized, through Resolution 1483, the military occupation of Iraq by the United States and the United Kingdom. They ended the economic sanctions, which had been in place for thirteen years, and permitted humanitarian aid, reconstruction and the establishment of a new government. Despite the optimistic plans for the future, Iraq was close to collapse at the end of 2006, which was also caused by the execution of Saddam Hussein on December 30th. The loss of the then Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his party, who was at power since 2006, during the 2010 elections for a new assembly and government, and the departure of the US forces in 2011 contributed to a tense situation. In addition to the political tension, Iraq has also suffered a lot from Islamic extremist organizations such as Al-Qaeda and ISIS until today."
Denton Cooley
"Denton Arthur Cooley (August 22, 1920 – November 18, 2016) was an American heart surgeon. He was known for doing the first implantation of a complete artificial heart. Cooley was also the founder and surgeon in-chief of The Texas Heart Institute, chief of Cardiovascular Surgery at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital, consultant in Cardiovascular Surgery at Texas Children's Hospital, and a clinical professor of Surgery at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston."
"He studied zoology in the University of Texas and graduated in 1941. He began his medical education at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. He completed his medical degree and his surgical training at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, where he also completed his internship. At Johns Hopkins, he worked with Dr. Alfred Blalock and helped with the first Blue Baby procedure to treat a child's congenital heart defect."
"In 1946, Cooley served as chief of surgical services at the station hospital in Linz, Austria for the Army Medical Corps. He was discharged (released) in 1948 with the rank of captain. Then, he returned to Johns Hopkins to remain as an instructor in surgery. In 1950, he went to London to work with Lord Russell Brock."
"Cooley died at his home in Houston on November 18, 2016, aged 96."
Pizzicato Polka
"The Pizzicato Polka is a piece of orchestral music by Johann Strauss II. Strauss composed it with his brother Josef in 1869 for a trip to Imperial Russia. It was published in 1870. The polka was written for string orchestra and glockenspiel. It was hugely popular, especially in Italy, where it was included on every program Strauss played there. The piece consists of four melodies and the work is arranged in ternary form (A-B-A). The piece is scored for plucked strings."
Emeritus
"Emeritus is a title given to a professor, bishop or other person with an important office. The title says that these people, while still holding their title, no longer practice their function. Usually, this is done because of old age. Usually the ""emeritus"" is put after the official title of the person, as in ""Professor emeritus""."
"In the time of the Roman Empire, it was used for soldiers, to say that they no longer needed to serve in the army. That way, a Bishop emeritus no longer needs to take part in the celebration of the mass, but he is still able to perform confirmations or to ordain priests."
Mumford &amp; Sons
Mumford &amp; Sons are an English folk rock band from London.
"The band was formed in 2007 by band members Marcus Mumford, Ben Lovett, Winston Marshall and Ted Dwane. Lead vocalist Marcus Mumford organised the band and their performances and was one of the most visible members of the band because of this the band decided to use the name Mumford &amp; Sons."
"They released their debut studio album ""Sigh No More"" on 2 October 2009. They later released their second studio album ""Babel"" on 21 September 2012. ""Babel"" won a Grammy Award for ""Album of the Year"" at the 2013 Grammy Awards. They were also a part of the documentary ""Big Easy Express"" which won a Grammy Award for ""Best Long Form Music Video""."
"""The Ghan"" normally runs weekly year round. During December 2012 and January 2013 it ran only once every two weeks. Until 2016, a second service operated between June and September. The train stops at Alice Springs and Katherine so passengers have time for optional tours."
"Each train has between 16 and 26 stainless steel carriages. These were built by Comeng, Granville in the late 1960s / early 1970s for the ""Indian Pacific"", plus a motorail wagon. The train is pulled by a Pacific National NR class locomotive. Sometimes, other locomotives such as an AN class or a DL class join the NR class to pull the train."
History.
"Starting in August 1929, ""The Ghan"" first ran on the Central Australian Railway. This was a narrow-gauge railway that went to Alice Springs. In 1957, the standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line opened, so the train only ran north of Marree. In October 1980 a new standard gauge line was built to the west of the original line. This was later extended north from Alice Springs to Darwin, opening in January 2004."
Original Ghan.
"The Port Augusta to Government Gums Railway began in 1878 when Premier of South Australia, William Jervois, broke ground at Port Augusta. The line reached Hawker in June 1880, Beltana in July 1881, Marree in January 1884, and Oodnadatta in January 1891. In 1926 work began to build the line to Alice Springs. and that section was completed in 1929. Until then, the final part of the train journey was made by camel."
"There were always plans to build the line to Darwin, but by the time the line to Alice Springs was built, ""The Ghan"" was losing money. Plans to reach Darwin were put on indefinite hold. The original line followed the same track as the overland telegraph, which is believed to be the route taken by John McDouall Stuart during his 1862 crossing of Australia."
"Steam locomotives need a lot of water, and Stuart's route to Alice Springs was the only one that had available water. This meant that when it did rain, the creeks and rivers often washed the track away."
"""The Ghan"" service was well known for long delays caused by these washouts. A flatcar behind the locomotive carried spare sleepers and railway tools, so that if there was damage to the track, the passengers and crew could repair the line. During World War II the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralisation towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track. This meant that bore water could be used in the locomotives. When the new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel engines meant that there was far less need for water. The line could take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs."
"The original Ghan was shown in BBC Television's series ""Great Railway Journeys of the World"" in 1980, presented by Michael Frayn."
New line.
"The original ""Ghan"" ran for the last time in 1980. The Ghan Preservation Society has repaired sections of the old narrow gauge track and some notable sidings. In October 1980 the new standard gauge line from Tarcoola on the Trans-Australian Railway to Alice Springs was opened. The new line is about west of the old line. This avoids the floodplains where the original line was often damaged by floods. It was also hoped that the new line would improve the train's timekeeping."
"The modern ""Ghan"" was in an episode of Channel 5's series ""Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways"". In November 1998, one service went from Adelaide to Melbourne while from April 1999, the other went to Sydney."
Connection to Darwin.
"Building the line between Alice Springs and Darwin is said to be the second-largest civil engineering project in Australia, the largest since the Snowy Mountains Scheme was built 1949–1974. Work began in July 2001, with the first passenger train reaching Darwin on 4 February 2004, after 126 years of planning and waiting. The cost was A$1.3 billion."
"""The Ghan's"" arrival in Darwin started a new era of tourism in the Northern Territory. Travel to the area was easier, with better access to and for Aboriginal communities. The rail link will allow for more freight to travel through the region, leading to a hope that Darwin will serve as another trade link with Asia."
One of the locomotives was named after Steve Irwin to help promote the new service and tourism to the region.
Itanium
"Itanium ( ) is a type of Intel microprocessors with 64-bit chip architecture (not related to the by now mainstream 64-bit CPUs made by Intel and others). Itanium processors are sometimes used today for servers. Itanium processors where originally designed by HP and Intel with Intel making producing them, and several manufacturers of systems used them; nowhere as many systems used as originally hoped for. By now mostly HP still supports systems using these chips."
"Intel officially announced the end of life and product discontinuance of the Itanium CPU family on January 30, 2019."
Market reception.
Powerful-type server market.
"When first released in 2001, Itanium's speed was disappointing compared to other processor types. Using existing x86 applications and operating systems was especially bad, with one test in 2001 showing that it was as fast as a 100 MHz Pentium (1.1 GHz Pentiums were on the market at that time)."
"Itanium did not have success compared to IA-32 or RISC, and was even worse when x86-64 was released, which worked with older x86 applications."
"In an article from 2009 about the history of Itanium — ""How the Itanium Killed the Computer Industry"" — journalist John C. Dvorak reported ""This continues to be one of the great fiascos [bad situations] of the last 50 years"" . Technology writer Ashlee Vance wrote that slowness in speed and release ""turned the product into a joke in the chip industry."" In an interview, Donald Knuth said ""The Itanium approach...was supposed to be so terrific—until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write."""
"Both Red Hat and Microsoft said that they would stop allowing Itanium to be used with their operating systems. However, other Linux distributions such as Gentoo and Debian are still available for Itanium. On March 22, 2011, Oracle said they would no longer support Itanium, but support for their existing products would continue. In October 2013, Oracle said they would release Oracle Database 12.1.0.1.0 on HP-UX Itanium 11.31 by early 2014."
"A past Intel company official said that Itanium had become profitable (Able to make a lot of money) for Intel in late 2009. In 2009 and later, Itanium was mostly used on servers by HP, which made 95% of Itanium servers, so the primary operating system for Itanium was HP-UX. On March 22, 2011, Intel said they will keep supporting Itanium entirely with many new Itanium chips being created and on-time."
Other markets.
"Although Itanium did do well with high-end computing, Intel wanted it to have more usage compared to the original x86 architecture."
"AMD decided on an easier idea, creating x86-64, a 64-bit addition to the x86 architecture, which Microsoft soon supported in Microsoft Windows, so Intel had to include the same type of 64-bit addition in Intel's x86 processors. x86-64 can use existing 32-bit applications at full hardware speed, but has 64-bit memory addressing and other additions to new applications. This architecture has now become the most used 64-bit architecture in the desktop and laptop market, with the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture powering many mobile devices, used in today's iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and now many Android phones and tablets such as the Nexus 6P and Nexus 9. Ssome Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, but they are no longer available. Because AMD made the first x86-64 chip, the architecture is commonly referred to as ""amd64"" inside of operating systems."

Heuristic
"A heuristic is a practical way to solve a problem. It is better than chance, but does not always work. A person develops a heuristic by using intelligence, experience, and common sense. Trial and error is the simplest heuristic, but one of the weakest. Rule of thumb and 'educated guesses' are other names for simple heuristics. Since a heuristic is not certain to get a result, there are always exceptions."
"Sometimes heuristics are rather vague: 'look before you leap' is a guide to behaviour, but 'think about the consequences' is a bit clearer. Sometimes a heuristic is a whole set of stages. When doctors examines a patient, they go through a whole set of tests and observations. They may not find out what is wrong, but they give themselves the best chance of succeeding. This is called a diagnosis."
"In computer science, a 'heuristic' is a kind of algorithm. Algorithms are written to get a good solution to a problem. A heuristic algorithm might usually find pretty good solutions, but there is no guarantee or proof that the solutions are correct. The time it takes to run the algorithm is another consideration."
Background.
"Heuristics is the art of finding an adequate solution to a problem, using limited knowledge and little time. More formally, heuristics are based on experience; they can speed up the search for a solution using simple rules. A complete search may take too long, or may be too difficult to do."
"In more precise terms, heuristics are strategies using readily accessible, though loosely applicable, information to control problem solving in human beings and machines."
"Heuristics can be used in some fields of science, but not in others: For economics, a solution that is one percent off is often acceptable; a telescope that has an error of one degree is probably unusable if aimed at a far-away object. The same telescope pointed to the window across the street will probably tolerate this error; missing by one degree will not have a big impact on a short distance."
"Heuristics can be used to estimate an answer which is then made more clear by performing an exact solution at a very small scale, perhaps to save time, money or labor on a project - for example a heuristic guess as to how much weight a bridge is expected to carry can be used to determine whether the bridge should be made of wood, stone or steel, and appropriate quantities of the needed material can be purchased while the exact design of the bridge is being completed."
"However, the use of heuristics in certain very technical fields may be damaging computer science is one example. Programming a computer to perform more or less the desired actions may result in severe glitches. Therefore, computer tasks generally must be fairly exact. However, there are certain areas in which computers can calculate heuristic solutions safely for example Google's search technology relies heavily on heuristics, producing ""near-miss"" matches to a search query when an exact match cannot be found. This enables a user to correct for any mistakes the search produces. Example: Searching for the name ""Peter Smith"" and unable to find that exact name, the search engine heuristically matches ""Pete Smith"" instead, and the person using the search engine must decide whether Pete and Peter are the same person."
Examples.
Polya.
"Here are some other commonly used heuristics, from Polya's 1945 book, ""How to Solve It"":"
Packing problem.
"One example where heuristics are useful is a kind of packing problem. The problem consists of packing a number of items. There are rules that need to be respected. For example, each item has a value and a weight. The problem now is to get the most valuable items, with the least weight possible. Another instance is fitting a number of differently-sized items into a confined space, like the trunk of a car."
"To get the perfect solution to the problem, all possibilities must be tried. This is often not a good option, as trying them takes a long time, and on average, half the possibilities must be tried until a solution is found. So what most people will do is to start with the biggest item, fit it in, and then try to arrange the other items around it. This will give a good solution, most of the time. There are cases however, where such a solution is very bad and another technique must be used."
"Therefore, this is a heuristic solution."
Mersenne prime
"In mathematics, a Mersenne number is a number that is one less than a ""power of two""."
"A Mersenne prime is a ""Mersenne number"" that is a prime number. This however, is not sufficient. Many mathematicians prefer the definition of a Mersenne number where exponent ""n"" has to be a prime number."
"For example, ""31 = 25 − 1"", and 5 is a prime number, so 31 is a Mersenne number; and 31 is also a Mersenne prime because it is a prime number. But the Mersenne number ""2047 = 211 − 1"" is not a prime because it is divisible by 89 and 23. And ""24 − 1 = 15"" can be shown to be composite because 4 is not prime."
"Other tourist attractions include a drive-in volcano, Sulphur Springs, the Botanical Gardens, the Majestic twin Peaks ""The Pitons"", a world heritage site, the rain forests, and Pigeon Island National Park."
"Most tourists visit Saint Lucia as part of a cruise. Most of their time tends to be spent in Castries, although Soufriere, Marigot Bay and Gros Islet are popular locations to visit."

"Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin (; March 9, 1934 – March 27, 1968) was a Soviet and Russian cosmonaut (astronaut)."
Early life.
"Yuri Gagarin was born in the village of Klushino near Gzhatsk (now in Smolensk Oblast, Russia), on 9 March 1934. Gzhatsk was renamed Gagarin in 1968 in his honour. His parents, Alexey Ivanovich Gagarin and Anna Timofeyevna Gagarina, worked on a collective farm. While manual workers are thought as ""peasants,"" this may be too-simple if applied to his parents — his mother was said to love reading, and his father was a skilled carpenter. Yuri was the third of four children, and his elder sister helped raise him while his parents worked. Like millions of people in the Soviet Union, the Gagarin family suffered during the Nazi invasion in World War II. His two elder siblings were sent out to Nazi Germany for slave work in 1943, and did not return until after the war. While a youth, Yuri became interested in space and planets, and began to dream about his space tour which would one day become a reality. Yuri was thought by his teachers, as smart and hard-working, sometimes mischievous. His mathematics and science teacher had flown in the Soviet Air Forces during the war, which was said to make some impression on young Gagarin."
"After starting an apprenticeship in a metalworks as a foundryman, Gagarin was selected for further training at a technical high school in Saratov. While there, he joined the flight club, and learned to fly a light aircraft. In 1955, after finishing his technical schooling, he entered military flight training at the Orenburg Pilot's School. While there he met Valentina Goryacheva. Yuri married her in 1957, after gaining his pilot's wings in a MiG-15. Post-graduation, he was told to go to Luostari airbase in Murmansk Oblast, close to the Norwegian border, where bad weather made flying risky. As a full-grown man, Gagarin was tall, which was an advantage in the small Vostok cockpit. He became a lieutenant of the Soviet Air Force on November 5, 1957 and on November 6, 1959 he got the rank of senior lieutenant."
Sports.
"Gagarin kept physically fit throughout his life, and was a good sportsman. As the space explorer Valery Bykovsky wrote:"
"As well as being a good ice hockey player, Gagarin was also a basketball fan, and coached the Saratov Industrial Technical School team, as well as being an umpire/referee."
Career in the Soviet space program.
Selection and training.
"In 1960, after the search and selection process, Yuri Gagarin was selected with 19 other space explorers for the ""Soviet space program"". Along with the other soon to be space explorers, he was tested by experiments made to test his physical and psychological score; he also underwent training for the upcoming flight. Out of the twenty originally selected, the final choice for the first launch was between Gagarin and Gherman Titov because of their performance in training, as well as their physical fitness."
Spaceflight.
"On 12 April 1961, Gagarin became the first man to travel into space, launching to orbit aboard the ""Vostok 3KA-3"" (Vostok 1). His call sign in this flight was Kedr (Cedar; ). During his flight, Gagarin famously whistled the song ""The Motherland Hears, The Motherland Knows"" (). The first two lines of the song are: ""The Motherland hears, the Motherland knows/Where her son flies in the sky"". This song was written by Dmitri Shostakovich in 1951 (opus 86), with words by Yevgeniy Dolmatovsky."
"Around the same time, some Western people claimed that Gagarin, during his space flight, had made the comment, """"I don't see any God up here""."" However, no such words appear in the direct record of Gagarin's talk with the Earth during the spaceflight. In a 2006 interview a close friend of Gagarin, Colonel Valentin Petrov, said that Gagarin never said such words, and that the phrase came from Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the fullness of the Central Committee of the CPSU, where the anti-religious propaganda was talked about. In a certain context Khrushchev said, """"Gagarin flew into space, but didn't see any God there""."""
Fame and later life.
"After the flight, Gagarin became a world famous celebrity. He toured in many places like in Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Japan. He did this to promote the Soviet Union achievements."
"In 1962, he began serving as a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. He later came back to Star City. While there, he worked on designs for a reusable spacecraft. Gagarin worked on these designs in Star City for seven years. He became Lieutenant Colonel (or Podpolkovnik) of the Soviet Air Force on 12 June 1962. Then on 6 November 1963 he got the rank of Colonel (Polkovnik) of the Soviet Air Force. Soviet people tried to keep him away from any flights, being worried of losing their hero in an accident. Gagarin was backup pilot for Vladimir Komarov in the Soyuz 1 flight. As Komarov's flight ended in a deadly crash, Gagarin was banned from training for and helping out in further spaceflight/s."
Death.
"Gagarin then became deputy training director of the Star City cosmonaut training base. At the same time, he began to re-join as a fighter pilot. On 27 March 1968, while on a routine training flight from Chkalovsky Air Base, he and flight instructor Vladimir Seryogin died in a MiG-15UTI crash near the town of Kirzhach. Gagarin and Seryogin were buried in the walls of the Kremlin on Red Square."
"People are not sure what caused the crash, but a 1986 investigation thinks that the turbulence from a Su-11 'Fishpot-C' interceptor using its afterburners may have caused Gagarin's plane to go out of control."
"Russian documents opened to the public in March 2003 showed that the KGB had changed their own investigation of the accident. In addition to this, one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report removed many conspiracy thoughts, instead of showing the actions of air base personnel added to the crash. The report says that an air traffic controller made Gagarin have old weather information. But by that time of his flight, conditions had become very bad. Ground crew also left fuel tanks on the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight needed good weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation ended, saying that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either because of a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the old weather report, the crew thought their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not properly react to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin."
"In his 2004 book ""Two Sides of the Moon"", Alexey Leonov tells that he was flying a helicopter in the same area that day when he heard ""two loud booms in the distance."" His thought was that the Sukhoi jet was flying below its minimum allowed altitude, and ""without realizing it because of the terrible weather conditions, he passed within 10 or 20 meters of Yuri and Seregin's plane while breaking the sound barrier."" The resulting turbulence would have sent the MiG into an uncontrolled spin. Leonov thinks the first boom he heard was that of the jet breaking the sound barrier, and the second was Gagarin's plane crashing."
Yangtze River
"The Yangtze River, or Yangzi (Simple Chinese: 扬子江 / Traditional Chinese: 揚子江), or Chang Jiang (Simple Chinese: 长江 / Traditional Chinese: 長江), is the longest River in China and Asia, as well as the world's third longest river (after the Amazon and the Nile). It is honored as one of the two main cradles of Chinese civilization. (another is Yellow River)"
"The river is about 3,900 kilometers long and is one of the busiest waterways in the world. It goes from the western part of China (Plateau of Tibet) into the East China Sea, which is part of the Pacific Ocean. It has been thought of as a dividing point between northern and southern China. It helped start the Chinese civilization."
"On the river is a big dam called the Three Gorges Dam, which is the biggest in the world. It forms a man-made lake that stretches almost upstream."
The Yangtze River is home to many species. The Finless porpoise is endangered and the Lipotes vexillifer (Chinese river dolphin) which died in 2002.
"Top tourist attractions for the Yangtze river cruise are Chongqing Dazu Carvings, Three Gorges, lesser Three Gorges, Bai Di City, Fengdu Ghost City and so on."
Examples in the Bible.
Here are seven types that can be found. These are just some of the many miracles in the Bible.
In other books.
"Other religious books, like the Quran, Mahabharata and the Avesta, contains many references to this definition of miracle. An example of a miracle in the Quran is when Muhammad splits the moon into halves."
Kami
"Kami (神) is a Japanese word for the spirits that are worshipped in the Shinto religion. Not all of Kami are gods of the personified type. Instead, they have to do with phenomena and events like the growth of trees, or rain, or wind, or other aspects of Nature; it is believed that these kami live in those natural things."
"It is usually said that there are . In Japanese the number ""eight-million"" is normally used to mean infinity."
"Though the word ""kami"" can be translated multiple ways into English, no English word expresses its full meaning."
Cardboard
"Cardboard is a heavy type of paper, notable for its stiffness and durability. It was first invented in China some time in the 15th century, and is used for a wide variety of purposes. One of its more common uses is as a packaging material."
"Cardboard boxes were first produced commercially in 1817 in England. Corrugated (also called pleated) paper was patented in England in 1856, used as a liner for tall hats, but corrugated cardboard would not be patented and used as a shipping material until 20 December 1871. The patent was issued to Albert Jones of New York City, New York for single-sided corrugated cardboard. Jones used the corrugated cardboard for wrapping bottles and glass lantern chimneys. The first machine for producing large quantities of corrugated cardboard was built in 1874 by G. Smyth, and in the same year Oliver Long improved upon Jones' design by inventing corrugated cardboard with liner sheets on both sides. This was now cardboard as we know it today."
"American Robert Gair was a Brooklyn printer and paper-bag maker during the 1870s, and while he was printing an order of seed bags a metal ruler normally used to crease bags shifted in position and cut the bag. Gair discovered that by cutting and creasing cardboard in one operation he could make prefabricated cartons. Extending this to corrugated cardboard was a straightforward development when the material became available. By the start of the 20th century, corrugated cardboard boxes began replacing the custom-made wooden crates and boxes previously used for trade."
"The Kellogg brothers first used cardboard cartons to hold their flaked corn cereal, and later when they began marketing it to the general public a heat-sealed waxed bag of ""Waxtite"" was wrapped around the outside of the box and printed with their brand name. This marked the origin of the cereal box, though in modern times the sealed bag is plastic and is kept inside the box rather than outside."
Cardboard packaging has undergone minor changes in recent times due to the trend towards environmentalism. It is now common for cardboard to be manufactured with a large percentage of recycled fibers.
English language
English is a language that started in Anglo-Saxon England. It is originally from Anglo-Frisian and Old Saxon dialects. English is now used as a global language. There are about 375 million native speakers (people who use it as their first language) in the world.
"Frisian is the language closest to English. The vocabulary of English was influenced by other Germanic languages in the early Middle Ages and later by Romance languages, especially French."
"English is the only official language or one of the official languages of nearly 60 countries. It is also the main language of more countries in the world than any other. It is the primary language in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. It is one of the official languages in Singapore, India, Hong Kong, and South Africa. It is widely spoken in parts of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia."
"In 2005, it was estimated that there were over 2 billion speakers of English. English is the first foreign language for most learners who have another main language. It is an official language of the United Nations, European Union, and many other international organizations. It is the most widely-spoken Germanic language, with at least 70% of Germanic speakers speaking English. About 220 million others use it as their second language. It is, together with German, the most important language of science and technology. It is often used in work and travel and trade, and there are at least a billion people who are learning it. That makes English the largest language by number of speakers."
"English has changed and developed over time, like all other languages. The most obvious changes are the many words taken from Latin and Old French, which then came to Old English and then Modern English, which is used today."
"English grammar has also become very different from other Germanic languages, but it stayed different from Romance languages. Because nearly 60% of the vocabulary comes from Latin, English is sometimes called the Germanic language that is the most Latin, and it is often mistaken for being a Romance language."
History.
"Germanic tribes (Saxons, Angles, and Jutes) came to Britain from around 449 AD. They made their home in the south and east of the island, pushing out the Celtic Britons who were there before them, or making them speak the English language instead of the old Celtic languages. Some people still speak Celtic languages today, in Wales (Welsh) and elsewhere. Gaelic is the Scottish Celtic language, still spoken by some in the Scottish Highlands and Islands. ""Scots"" is a dialect of English, taken from the English spoken in Northumbria. Irish Gaelic is spoken by very few people today."
"The Germanic dialects of the different tribes became what is now called Old English. The word ""English"" comes from the name of the Angles: ""Englas"". Old English did not sound or look much like the English spoken today. If English speakers today were to hear or read a passage in Old English, they would understand just a few words."
"The closest language to English that is still used today is Frisian, spoken by about 500,000 people living in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark. It is much like English, and many words are the same. The two languages were even closer before Old English changed to Middle English). Today, speakers of the two languages would not be able to understand each other. Dutch is spoken by over 20 million people, and is more distant from English. German is even bigger, and even more distant. All these languages belong to the same West Germanic family as English."
"Many other people came to England later at different times, speaking different languages, and these languages added more words to make today's English. For example, around 800 AD, many Danish and Norse pirates, also called Vikings, came to the country, established Danelaw. So, English got many Norse loanwords. Their languages were Germanic languages, like Old English, but are a little different. They are called the North Germanic languages."
"When William the Conqueror took over England in 1066 AD, he brought his nobles, who spoke Norman, a language closely related to French. English changed a lot because it was mostly being spoken instead of written for about 300 years, because all official documents were written in Norman French. English borrowed many words from Norman at that time, and also began to drop the old word endings. English of this time is called Middle English. Geoffrey Chaucer is a well known writer of Middle English. After more sound changes, Middle English became Modern English."
"English continued to take new words from other languages, for example mainly from French (around 30% to 40% of its words), but also Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, Japanese, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, etc. Because scientists from different countries needed to talk to one another, they chose names for scientific things in the languages they all knew: Greek and Latin. Those words came to English also, for example, ""photography"" (""photo-"" means ""light"" and ""-graph"" means ""picture"" or ""writing"", in Greek. A photograph is a picture made using light), or ""telephone"". So, English is made of Old English, Danish, Norse, and French, and has been changed by Latin, Greek, Chinese, Hindi, Japanese, Dutch and Spanish, along with some words from other languages."
"English grammar has also changed, becoming simpler and less Germanic. The classic example is the loss of case in grammar. Grammatical case shows the role of a noun, adjective or pronoun in a sentence. In Latin (and other Indo-European languages), this is done by adding suffixes, but English usually does not. The style of English is that meaning is made clear more by context and syntax."
Nazi rise to power (1919–1934).
"Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, wrote a book called ""Mein Kampf"" (""My Struggle""). The book said that all of Germany's problems happened because Jews were making plans to hurt the country. He also said that Jewish and communist politicians planned the Armistice of 1918 that ended World War I, and allowed Germany to agree to pay huge amounts of money and goods (reparations)."
"In November 1923, the Nazis tried to overthrow the democratic German government that had been set up after WWI. Nazi thinking emphasises conflict and violence, and believes that these are the best way to sort out political problems. The Nazis had therefore set up their own private army, called the Sturmabteilung (SA) which were sometimes known as the 'Nazi stormtroopers' or simply the 'brownshirts'. Many political parties had their own private armies at this time in Germany to guard their events and meetings from the private armies of other political parties. The attempt to take power is referred to as the Munich Putsch or Beer Hall Putsch and was crushed after less than 24 hours."
"After the Putsch, Hitler was imprisoned for six months and the Nazi Party briefly banned. It was allowed to exist again in if it promised to only be democratic. The Nazis agreed, but made it clear that if they took power in Germany, they would turn Germany into a dictatorship. The Nazis believed in something called the Führer Principle, which means that they believe that all groups should be organised like armies, with absolute loyalty shown to the leader of the group. They wanted to apply this principle to Germany. They disagreed with democracy, because they believed that it divided groups which made them weaker."
"The Nazis performed very badly in elections until the early 1930s, where they became exceptionally popular. This can be partly explained by a massive increase in poverty in Germany caused by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, and Nazi promises to rebuild German strength and pride. However, this is not the only reason for the Nazis coming to power, because it still took more than three years for Adolf Hitler to become Chancellor of Germany after the Crash."
"On the night of the 27 February 1933 and 28 February 1933, someone set the Reichstag building on fire. This was the building where the German Parliament held their meetings. The Nazis blamed the communists. Opponents of the Nazis said that the Nazis themselves had done it to come to power. On the very same day, an emergency law called ""Reichstagsbrandverordnung"" was passed. The government claimed it was to protect the state from people trying to hurt the country. With this law, most of the civil rights of the Weimar Republic did not count any longer. The Nazis used this against the other political parties. Members of the communist and social-democratic parties were put into prison or killed."
"The Nazis became the biggest party in the parliament. By 1934, they managed to make all other parties illegal. Democracy was replaced with a dictatorship. Adolf Hitler became leader (""Führer"") of Germany, and had the power to make any laws he wanted."
Life in Nazi Germany (1934–1945).
"The Nazis changed Germany to fit their ideas of what a country should be like. They created a totalitarian state, which is a country where the government tries to have total control over ordinary people's lives."
"In schools, several subjects were changed to fit a Nazi interpretation. History was taught to emphasise German military victories and blames Jewish people and Marxists for defeat in WWI. Children were also taught racial hygiene lessons, where pseudo-scientific racist principles taught to them. In 1936, all German children had to be members of the Hitler Youth which was a Nazi version of the Scouting movement, and was designed to prepare them to be soldiers in wars against other races."
"People who opposed the Nazis were seen as traitors. The Nazis created a very effective police state, led by Heinrich Himmler and his deputy Reinhard Heydrich. They were in charge of an organisation called the Schutzstaffel (SS) that took control of all of the police forces in Germany. The SS also set up a new secret police organisation called the Gestapo which hunted down people who wanted to protest against the Nazi government. Enemies of the Nazis were regularly tortured, put in concentration camps or executed."
Attacking other countries.
"As the German leader (Führer) of Nazi Germany, Hitler began moving Nazi armies into neighboring countries. When Germany attacked Poland, World War II started. Western countries like France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were occupied and to be treated by Germany as colonies. However, in Eastern countries, such as Poland and the Soviet Union, the Nazis planned to kill or enslave the Slavic peoples, so that German settlers could take their land."
"The Nazis made alliances with other European countries, such as Finland and Italy. Every other European country that allied with Germany did it because they did not want to be taken over by Germany. Through these alliances and invasions, the Nazis managed to control much of Europe."
The Holocaust.
"In the Holocaust, millions of Jews, as well as Roma people (also called ""Gypsies""), people with disabilities, homosexuals, political opponents, and many other people were sent to concentration camps and death camps in Poland and Germany. The Nazis killed millions of these people at the concentration camps with poison gas. The Nazis also killed millions of people in these groups by forcing them to do slave labor without giving them much food or clothing. In total, 17 million people died, 6 million of them being Jews."
Victory of the Allies.
"In 1945, the Soviet Union took over Berlin after defeating the German army in Russia. The Soviet Red Army met the American and British armies, who had fought right across Germany after invading Nazi Europe from Normandy in France on June 6,1944. The Nazis lost because the Allies had many more soldiers and more money than them."
"During the invasion of Berlin, Hitler shot himself in a bunker with his new wife, Eva Braun. Other Nazis also killed themselves, including Joseph Goebbels just one day after Hitler named him as his successor. The Nazis surrendered after the Red Army captured Berlin."
Nuremberg Trials.
"After the war, the Allied governments, namely the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, held trials of the Nazi leaders. These trials were held in Nuremberg, Germany. For this reason, these trials were called ""the Nuremberg Trials."" The Allied leaders accused the Nazi leaders of war crimes and crimes against humanity, including murdering millions of people (in the Holocaust), of starting wars, of conspiracy, and belonging to illegal organizations like the SS (called, ""Schutzstaffel"", in German). Most Nazi leaders were found guilty by the court, and they were sent to jail or sentenced to death and executed."
Nazis after the war.
"There has not been a ""Nazi"" state since 1945, but there are still people who believe in those ideas. These people are often called ""neo""-Nazis. Here are some examples of modern Nazi ideas:"
"After the war, laws were made in Germany and other countries, especially countries in Europe, that make it illegal to say the Holocaust never happened. Sometimes they also ban questioning the number of people affected by it, which is saying that not so many people were killed as most people think ""who wrote this?"" There has been some controversy over whether this affects people's free speech. Certain countries, such as Germany, Austria, and France, also banned the use of Nazi symbols. It is also banned to make a Nazi pledge position on a popular media source to stop Nazis from using them."
Pork
Pork is meat that comes from pigs. It is the most commonly consumed meat in the world Evidence of pig husbandry dates back to 5000 BC.
"A simple meal to make which contains pork is afelia. Sausages, bacon and ham are the most common uses of pork in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other parts of the Western world. Pork is forbidden by the food taboos of kosher and halal."
Mike Farrell
"Mike Farrell (born February 6, 1939) is an American actor, writer and producer. He played BJ Hunnicutt on the television series ""M*A*S*H"". He played Michael ""Mike"" Hawks in the television movie ""Battered"" in 1978. He played Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin in the limited crime series """"."
"Farrell was born in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was raised in Hollywood, California. He was part of the United States Marine Corps. Farrell was married to Judy Hayden from 1963 until they divorced in 1983. Then, he married Shelley Fabares in 1984. He has two children with Hayden."
"Ancient Hawaiians used rocks from rivers to cook pig. They heated the rocks in the imu and the pig cooked with steam. They covered the pig with banana leaves, ti leaves, old mats and then dirt to keep the heat inside. This produced a unique taste that cannot be reproduced."
People today kalua pig in the same way that ancient Hawaiians did. Kalua pig is still served at luaus.
Ultraviolet
"Ultraviolet is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum shown on the left side of the picture below as black—because humans cannot see light of such short wavelength (or high frequency). Many animals such as some insects, some reptiles, crocodiles, salamanders, and small birds can see things that this light. UV is a common abbreviation of ultraviolet, mainly used in technical contexts."
"Ultraviolet is beyond the visible violet light in terms of frequency, wavelength, and energy. Its wavelengths are between about 10 nanometers (nm) to about 400 nanometers. Frequency and wavelength are closely related. The equation that shows this relationship is: ν = c/λ . Saying that something has a short wavelength is the same as saying that it has a high frequency."
Ultraviolet radiation.
"Ultraviolet light is a type of ionizing radiation. It can damage or kill cells. Any electromagnetic radiation (light) that has a wavelength shorter than 450 nm may cause trouble. Therefore, humans that live in places with more ultraviolet light have adapted by getting darker skins. Pigments absorb the ultraviolet radiation, so it does not get through the skin to kill or injure cells inside. Injury to the skin by ultraviolet is called ""sunburn."""
"The violet light and ultraviolet light differ in their wavelength, frequency, and quantum energy. The differences between ultraviolet light and x-rays are also wavelength, frequency and quantum energy. In the electromagnetic spectrum, ultraviolet is beyond violet, x-rays are beyond ultraviolet, and gamma rays are beyond x-rays."
Electromagnetic waves with a wavelength from about 400 nanometers down to about 10 nanometers are commonly called ultraviolet. Their characteristic photon energy is about 3 to 124 electronvolts.
"Although the air of the Earth is transparent to a broad range of ultraviolet, some ultraviolet sunlight is absorbed at a very high altitude by the ozone layer. Recent and ongoing destruction of ozone in high altitudes caused by human influence—mostly by industrial chemicals and air travel—has greatly increased the amount of ultraviolet light reaching the Earth's surface. This, in turn, has increased the risk of skin cancer to mankind, and this risk will only increase with time unless the ozone layer is better protected."
"Ultraviolet wavelengths less than 200 nanometers, X-rays, and gamma rays, are collectively called ionizing radiation since the energy in any such light quantum is high enough to 'kick' an electron out of an atom. This is why these kinds of radiation are dangerous to life. Ultraviolet light is subdivided into three main bands. UV-C has the shortest wavelengths and is dangerous ionizing radiation. Nitrogen and oxygen absorb the UV-C from solar radiation. UV-B has medium wavelength and is less dangerous to living things. The Earth's ozone layer absorbs most of it. UV-A from the Sun gets through the atmosphere entirely. It has wavelength almost as long as visible light, and many animals can see it but humans cannot."
"Ordinary glass does not let radiation through if its wavelength is less than 200 nanometers, so it acts as a shield against the more dangerous range of ultraviolet light, but some special sorts of glass do not shield as well, including many car windows."
"One use for ultraviolet radiation is tanning. Use of tanning devices can cause skin cancer because ultraviolet goes through the skin and causes destruction to cells, causing sunburn."
"Because of the destructive power of ultraviolet light, it can be used to kill germs. Sunlight is a powerful disinfectant."
People need some ultraviolet light to convert cholesterol into vitamin D.
Ultraviolet lamp.
"An ultraviolet lamp is one that emits mostly ultraviolet light. These germicidal lamps are often used to kill microbes (germs). They can be very powerful, so the people who work around them when they are turned on may need to wear protective glasses and keep their skin covered to avoid injury."
"In the laboratory pictured, ultraviolet lights are turned on when the workers are gone, so that anything on the table surface will be killed. Besides ultraviolet light, which makes up most of the light produced by these lamps, there is also a little violet and blue light. This lets people know when the ultraviolet lamps are turned on."
Ornithology
Ornithology is the study of birds. A person who studies birds is called an ornithologist.
Aspects.
"Several aspects of ornithology differ from other disciplines, because they are easy to see and are often attractive. Many studies of birds have been done by amateurs working in a scientific manner."
History.
"Konrad Gesner wrote his ""Vogelbuch"" and ""Icones avium omnium"" around 1557. Later, England developed a tradition of ornithology. Francis Willughby, John Ray, Gilbert White, John Gould (who studied the birds of Australia) and Peter Scott are good examples."
What ornithologists do.
"Ornithologists typically trap birds for a closer look at them. This does not hurt the bird. Trapping birds can be done with in different ways, depending on the type of bird. For example, mist nets cause birds that fly into them to fall into a small pocket where the ornithologist can come back later and take a closer look."
"After the bird has been caught, the ornithologist will usually inspect (take a close look at) the bird. They may also attach a small ring to the bird's leg before releasing the bird. The ring allows ornithologists to study the bird's migration patterns, how long they live, and other information about the bird's species."
Rod Stewart
"Sir Roderick David Stewart, (born 10 January 1945) is a British pop singer, known professionally as Rod Stewart. He was born in London to an English mother and Scottish father. When he started singing in the 1960s, he was player for Brentford F.C., a football team. He started singing in local R&amp;B groups, in the 1970s he began a solo career which made him very famous."
"Some of the new teachings resulted in suffering for many Jehovah's Witnesses. Thousands were sent to prison, beaten or killed in several countries during World War II because they refused to fight. In Germany, many were sent to concentration camps because they would not support the Nazi Party. Later, in the United States, many of their children were expelled from schools because they refused to salute the flag, because they thought that God would not approve. Some countries still have laws against members practicing the religion. By 1977 they had more than two million members around the world."
Armageddon expected in 1975.
"From 1966, the religion suggested that God could bring Armageddon in 1975, and that the Kingdom would be set up very soon after. Some Witnesses sold businesses and homes, gave up jobs, delayed medical operations and decided against starting a family because they expected Armageddon to arrive. Many members that assumed Armageddon would come in 1975 left at the time, but many other people joined and the group kept growing."
Beliefs.
One God.
"Like many Christian religions, Jehovah's Witnesses believe there is an all-powerful, all-knowing God who created everything. They also have some beliefs that are different from most Christians. They believe God calls himself Jehovah (a translation of the Hebrew letters ""YHWH"") and they believe it is important to use that name. In which, 'God' is a title, as to, daughter, mother, father, son and etc. This is why they believe it is important to address God by his name. They believe Jesus is God's son, the first angel, and that he is also called Michael the Archangel. They say the holy spirit is God's power rather than a person. They do not believe in the Trinity. They believe the Bible is a book that God used humans to write and that it is completely true and the best guide for how people should live."
Adam and Eve.
"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God made Adam and Eve, the first humans, and put them in a garden called Eden. They believe that when Adam and Eve sinned, they no longer had God's approval so they began to get sick and die. They were not perfect any more and could not have perfect children. Because of this, humans could not remain sinless. They believe that Jehovah later sent Jesus to die (on a pole (stake), not a cross, as most Christians believe, which is known as 'Christendom') to forgive mankind's sins."
Heaven.
"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people, a number found in Revelation chapters 7 and 14, will go to heaven to be kings and priests with Jesus Christ. They say that God will start a worldwide war called Armageddon, and the people who do not obey God or worship him the way he expects will be killed. The people who he approves will survive and be given the opportunity to live forever. Then God will begin to turn Earth into a paradise without crime, sickness, pain, aging, wars or death. They say God will also resurrect (bring back to life) billions of people who died in the past so they can learn about God and have a chance to live in paradise as well."
"Jehovah's Witnesses believe only their religion really obeys God's instructions and that God does not approve of any other religions (including Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists and Muslims) because they do not follow the Bible the right way. They believe that Satan the Devil is the real leader of all other religions and makes them think they worship God the right way. (AKA: Satan the Devil is the ruler of this wicked world, but only for a short time).(1 John 5:19) So they believe that only Jehovah's Witnesses will be saved at Armageddon, but they say God will make the final choice."
What they do.
Door-to-door work.
"Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for their door-to-door preaching. They believe Jesus ordered them at Matthew 28:19 to ""go make disciples of all the nations"", warning people that the day of God's judgement, or Armageddon, will happen soon. Jehovah's Witnesses believe their preaching is a fulfillment of a prophecy at Matthew 24:14, ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come."" All Witnesses are told to spend as much time as they can in public preaching work, usually offering ""The Watchtower"" and other Watch Tower Society publications. Since the Internet, Jehovah's Witnesses also preach online. They teach people their beliefs about Jehovah and his plans for the earth. Members are asked to give a monthly written report on how much time they have spent publicly preaching."
Meetings.
"The buildings where Jehovah's Witnesses meet to worship are called Kingdom Halls. Unlike many other churches, these halls do not have altars, statues, or symbols such as the Cross. Each congregation has three meetings each week:"
"Members unable to attend in person can also listen to the meeting over the phone or by video streaming where available. They also attend one large regional convention and two circuit assemblies a year (some of them at hired sports arenas), where hundreds or thousands of members gather depending on the location."
"Jehovah’s Witnesses hold meetings for worship twice each week. (Hebrews 10:24, 25) At these meetings, which are open to the public, they examine what the Bible says and how to apply its teachings in life. At some meetings, people in the audience, including children, are invited to answer questions and make comments. The religion has elders and ministerial servants who take the spiritual lead in their congregations, but they do not dress differently to other members and they are not paid. Most elders support themselves with jobs outside the religion."
Rules.
Members of the religion are expected to live up to high moral standards. They are told they should always be honest.
Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to:
"Jehovah's Witnesses are told to marry only other baptized Jehovah's Witnesses. They believe God does not approve of divorce unless the husband or wife cheated. They can separate from a partner who hurt their family or refused to support them, but they would not be allowed to marry someone else."
"They also refuse blood transfusions because the Bible says not to eat blood or consume it in any other way, and they believe that putting blood in their veins is equivalent to consuming it ."
"They are told not to make close friends with non-Witnesses because they could make their faith in God weaker, or possible sever their relationship with Him completely."
Membership.
"Jehovah's Witnesses are quite strict about who can be a member. Jehovah's Witnesses are only counted as members if they are baptized. Like other Christian groups, they believe baptism represents devotion to God and their promise to live by his teachings. Unlike some Christian groups, Witnesses are not baptized as babies. They believe baptism should be a choice made by someone who understands what it means."
"If the elders think a baptized Witness has willingly disobeyed direction set forth in the Bible, they will investigate. That investigation is called a ""judicial committee"". If the elders decide the person is 'guilty' and does not regret what they did, he or she might be ""disfellowshipped"". This means the person is no longer a member of the group. When that happens, no other Jehovah's Witnesses are allowed to talk to or interact with that person (except in some situations such as living or working together) unless the disfellowshipped person repents and is allowed back in. When such a person is allowed back in, they have been 'reinstated'."
"Some people, including former Witnesses, have criticized this punishment as harsh and unfair. The style of leadership of the group has also been described by some authors as autocratic and totalitarian, because members have to be completely submissive to the direction of Jehovah as found in the Bible to the greatest extent they possibly can."

Jehovah's Witnesses' brochures about the name Jehovah
"In the 1950s, recording companies took blues-influenced rock and roll (for example Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley) and rockabilly (for example Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly) and promoted them as pop music. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, record companies took folk music bands and musicians and helped them to create a new type of music called folk rock or acid rock. Folk rock and acid rock mixed folk music, blues and rock and roll (for example The Byrds and Janis Joplin). In the 1970s, record companies created several harder, louder type of blues called blues rock or heavy metal, which became a type of pop music (for example the bands Led Zeppelin and Judas Priest)."
"In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a type of nightclub dance music called Disco turned into a popular type of pop music. Record companies took an experimental, strange-sounding type of music called New Wave music from the 1980s and turned it into pop music bands such as ""The Cars."" In the 1990s record companies took an underground type of hard rock called Grunge (for example the band Nirvana). Michael Jackson was also a very influential artist for pop music. His album, ""Thriller"", is the best-selling album of all time. He also wrote some other very influential songs, such as ""Bad"", ""Give In to Me"", ""Will You Be There"", ""Heal the World"", ""We Are the World"", ""Black or White"", and ""Billie Jean"", just to name a few. By the 21st century (after the demise of disco in the 1980s) Contemporary R&amp;B became pop music. Examples of Contemporary R&amp;B artists that have a wide pop appeal are Usher, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Chris Brown and more. Pop rappers Flo Rida and Kesha were mainstream in the late 2000s and the early 2010s. Modern pop singers include Ariana Grande, Katy Perry and Lady Gaga. Nicki Minaj blended pop and hip hop in the early 2010s."
"Many bands and artists are looked as influential in music history, but the English band The Beatles are the most looked upon band in history because of many of their songs being different types of pop and rock music (even metal and punk). Michael Jackson, The Bee Gees, Nirvana (band) are many of the artists and bands that look at The Beatles as a massive influence on their music."
General semantics
General semantics is a philosophy that deals with how people react to things that happen around them based on meaning. It was created by Alfred Korzybski during the 1920s and early 1930s.
"The goal of general semantics is for people to know that when we simplify something, either mentally or in language, that simplification is not the same thing as the thing simplified. How people understand reality is not the same as what reality is because people do not know everything about reality. General semantics teaches that there is always more to something than what is seen, heard, felt, or believed."
Semiotics
"Semiotics (or semiology) is a theoretical framework for the study of the meaning of language, signs and symbols. It was first developed in the early 20th century, separately, by the Swiss Ferdinand Saussure and Charles Sanders Peirce of the U.S.A. It can be described as both a science and a technique: a science because it has its own theories and a technique because it is a way of studying systems of representation and meaning. The meaning can be intentional such as a word uttered with a specific meaning, or unintentional, such as a symptom being a sign of a particular medical condition. Signs can communicate through any of the senses, visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or gustatory."
History and terminology.
"The importance of signs and signification has been recognized throughout much of the history of philosophy, and in psychology as well. The term derives from the Greek: σημειωτικός, ""sēmeiōtikos"", ""observant of signs"" (from σημεῖον ""sēmeion"", ""a sign, a mark""). For the Greeks, ""signs"" occurred in the world of nature, and ""symbols"" in the world of culture. As such, Plato and Aristotle explored the relationship between signs and the world."
"The general study of signs that began in Latin with Augustine culminated with the 1632 ""Tractatus de Signis"" of John Poinsot, and then began anew in late modernity with the attempt in 1867 by Charles Sanders Peirce to draw up a ""new list of categories."" More recently, Umberto Eco, in his ""Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language"", has argued that semiotic theories are implicit in the work of most, perhaps all, major thinkers."
Semiotics is usually divided into three parts:
The major branches of semiotics include:
Nitrogen
Nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element. The atmosphere contains more than 78 percent of nitrogen. It has the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7. Its stable inside typically contains 14 nucleons (7 protons and 7 neutrons). It has 5 electrons in its outer shell.
Properties.
"Nitrogen is a colorless odorless gas at normal temperature. It is normally attached to another nitrogen atom, making a nitrogen molecule (N2). This bond is very strong. That is why many explosives contain nitrogen. The bond is broken when the explosive is made. When it explodes the bond reforms, releasing a lot of energy."
"It turns into a liquid at -195.8°C and turns into a solid at -210°C. If it is compressed, it can be turned into a liquid without making it cold."
"It usually does not combine with other atoms because its strong bond prevents it from reacting. Lithium is one of the few chemical elements that react with nitrogen without being heated. Magnesium can burn in nitrogen. Nitrogen also makes blue electric sparks. The blue color is caused by the atoms being excited. When they get normal again, they release light. When nitrogen is excited, it reacts with many things that it does not normally react with."
Compounds.
"Many chemical compounds that are important for industrial purposes contain nitrogen ions. These include ammonia, nitric acid, nitrates and cyanides. Nitrogen comes in several oxidation states; -3, -2, -1/3, +1, +3, +4, and +5. Each of those oxidation states has its set of compounds."
"Compounds in the -3 oxidation state are weak reducing agents. These include ammonia, ammonium, amide and nitrides. Amino acids and proteins contain nitrogen in this oxidation state. Hydrazine, a compound in the -2 oxidation state, is a strong reducing agent. Azides contain nitrogen in the -1/3 oxidation state. They are extremely powerful reducing agents, and most are very toxic."
"Nitrous oxide contains nitrogen in the +1 oxidation state. It is used as an anesthetic. Compounds containing nitrogen in the +2 oxidation state, such as nitric oxide, are reducing agents. +3 oxidation state compounds are strong oxidizing agents and weak reducing agents. Nitrites are the most common +3 compounds. Compounds in the +4 oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents. They include nitrogen dioxide and dinitrogen tetroxide."
"Compounds containing nitrogen in the +5 oxidation state are strong oxidizing agents. They are one of the more common groups of nitrogen compounds. They include nitric acid and dinitrogen pentoxide. They also include nitrates, which are used in explosives such as dynamite, nitroglycerin and trinitrotoluene."
Occurrence and preparation.
"Air is made up of about 78% nitrogen and about 20.95% oxygen, &lt; 1% argon, and traces of other gasses such as carbon dioxide, and water vapor, among others. It is also in a few nitrates in the ground. Ammonium minerals are rare. Nitrogen is in proteins."
"Pure liquid nitrogen can be made by cooling air. The nitrogen turns into a liquid at a different temperature than the oxygen. It can also be made by heating certain chemical compounds, such as sodium azide."
Uses.
Nitrogen as an element is used to prevent things from reacting with the oxygen in the air. It can be used to fill crisp bags and incandescent bulbs. It is also used to fill some tires. It can be used to make electric components like transistors. Liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze things.
Peak-end rule
"The peak-end rule is a psychological term proposed by and Daniel Kahneman. It suggests the following: When evaluating an experience, people do not recall details in every moment they experienced. People mainly recall what happened and how they felt at the peak and the end of the event. The peak is the time when they had the strongest emotion. Our feelings at the peak and the end of the event decide what people generally feel about an experience. The feelings at the peak and the end take up similar weights, which means the memory of the experience is the average of the two."
"The peak-end rule is a form of . When evaluating past experiences, people concentrate on the peak and the end while other parts of the experience are neglected. How long they have had the experience, is neglected."
"According to peak-end rule, humans use false memories to form preferences and make decisions. Thus, decisions are very unlikely to lead to the best outcome they want. By contrast, the standard economics suggests that humans can always choose something that serves them the best, producing the largest net pleasantness. The establishment of the theory is evidence against the rational choice theory."
First establishment and one scientific example.
"The peak–end rule was first established by Daniel Kahneman and others in 1993. In the experiment, participants were divided into two groups. They had to undergo an unpleasant experience. Everything else was the same, except for one group who had to go through an extra, less unpleasant experience at the end. Let us call this group Group B and previous group Group A."
"The researchers concluded that the most unpleasant, the peak, and the final intensity of unpleasantness, the end were used to evaluate the procedure. In this case, the end of Group B is less unpleasant. At the same time, the peak of both Group A and Group B were the same. Thus, the sum of the unpleasantness of the peak and the end was less for Group B. As a result, participants from Group B found the experience less unpleasant, although for both the duration of and the sum of unpleasantness, Group A &lt; Group B."
Explanations.
Why only the peak and the end?
"The peak-end rule is a type of . The peak and the end simplify and represent the whole experience. It reduces people's and helps people make quick decisions.From an evolutionary point of view, emotion related memories help us survive, keep us safe. For example, fear related memories help us recognize and better deal with dangerous situations."
The peak is memorable.
"When memory sticks, it lasts longer and can be recalled easier. Memories associated with strong emotions stick. Experiments were done to prove strong emotion-related things are recalled more often. An experiment done by found a biological explanation for this."
The end is memorable.
"Why our memory prefers what happened at the end can be explained by the recency effect. suggests that we consider recent events to be more important. What happens at the end of an experience is more recent to us. Thus, we consider the things that happen at the end of an experience to be more important. The end is more memorable than other parts."
Application.
How to leave a good impression.
"Adding a positive peak can establish a good memory of an experience even though there may be unimportant unpleasant moments in between. This technique has been applied to many fields, for example, the business field. When customers are leaving, salesmen help the customer hold the door. This act leaves a good final and overall impression. Another example is in the educational field. To make receiving negative feedback more acceptable, ending with the most pleasant part of the feedback will help."
Become regulars.
"People's memories of an experience influence their decision making. Adding a good end encourages people to experience the event a second time. Some medical procedures are too painful for the patients to repeat. Adding something positive at the end creates a more positive impression of the experience. After doing so, there is a smaller probability the patient is unwilling to receive the treatment a second time. Then, patients can more effectively recover with a less total cost and shorter time."
A negative end.
"Inversely, a negative end ruins the memory of an experience even though everything before was perfect.If a person wants themselves or other people to do something less, adding a negative end to the experience helps."
Reflect on our own experiences.
"People's memories of their experiences are not what they experienced. So, relying on our memories to make decisions does not lead to the highest net pleasure. To experience the net largest amount of pleasure, people should spend as much time as possible on things that they are unwilling to stop doing."
Restrictions and criticisms.
"Studies found that other factors influence the peak-end rule. Firstly, the expectation. A high expectation is compared with the actual experience at the start. If a difference exists, the starting experience will be the most important factor in overall experience evaluation. The peak-end rule is more likely to be applicable to lower expectation situations. Secondly, one study finds that the effect of peak-end law is small on one day experiences. Moreover, some people are easily affected by the rule but others are not. Thirdly, according to and Carmon, how we feel at the moment of evaluation also affects the outcome."
Loss aversion
Loss aversion is a concept in psychology. It is to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. The principle is prominent in economics.
"The principle of loss aversion was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Loss aversion happens when people face the same amount of gains and losses and find the loss is more unbearable. In other words, the pain of loss is greater than the pleasure of equal gain. In some experiments, it shows females have a higher level of loss aversion than males."
Affective Science and Neural basis.
"The cause of loss aversion lies in people's asymmetric emotional response to gain and loss. Studies show that this asymmetry is particularly strong during the anticipation processing and the immediate experience after presenting the outcome. One study of income and well-being indicates that when people make loss-averse choices, it is not directly due to the loss itself but because the impact brings a series of negative consequences that follow the loss.A classic example presented in the book ""Thinking, Fast and Slow"" of a flipping coin implies that people will first compare the satisfaction of gaining with the pain of losing before making a decision. Thus, most people would not choose to participate in coin gambling with 50% to get $150 and 50% to lose $100; and according to the ""loss aversion ratio,"" the minimum amount to fulfil the pain of losing $100 will be $200 (assume the coefficient is 2)."
"In 2001, J. O' Doherty and his colleagues had found that humans process losses and gains in qualitatively different ways by using brain imaging technology and suggests the correlation between the magnitude of brain activation and the extent of reward and losses received.When we are evaluating potential gains, the areas of the brain that process value and reward become more active than it does when assessing the potential losses. The different loss aversion levels differ from individuals by the degrees of sensitivity to losses and gains, in which people are more loss-averse with stronger sensitivity."
Measurements.
"There are two ways people find the number for specific impulse. To find the specific impulse, one divides the impulse by the amount of fuel. Impulse is a measurement of how much force a rocket motor makes and for how long. A motor that makes a low force for a long time can sometimes have a higher impulse than a motor that makes a high force for a short time. Impulse is measured in Newtons times seconds (N*s)."
"The amount of fuel used to find specific impulse can be measured in different ways. It is sometimes measured in mass and sometimes in weight. When the amount of fuel is measured in mass, the specific impulse is expressed as a speed. This is usually in meters per second. When specific impulse is measured as a speed, it has another name. It is also called the ""effective exhaust velocity"". The other way to measure the amount of fuel is weight. If weight is used, the specific impulse is in units of time, usually in seconds. These two ways are both common. They both compare the performance of engines."
"When the specific impulse is higher, less fuel is needed to make the rocket perform at a certain level. So, a fuel is more efficient if the specific impulse is higher."
Be careful not to confuse thrust and specific impulse. Thrust is only the force made by a rocket at one point in time. Specific impulse is a measure of the force based on how much fuel there is.
"When people find specific impulse, the only fuel counted is in the rocket before it gets fired. This includes the fuel and the oxidizer (the part of the fuel that helps the fuel burn). The oxidizer is sometimes oxygen, or often something else (see Rocket engine#Liquids, solids and hybrids)."
Examples.
"Jet (airplane) engines use fuel better than rocket engines. This is because the gases do not escape as fast. Because they do not escape as fast, the exhaust does not carry away as much energy. This means that the jet engine uses a lot less energy to push the jet. It is also because the air that goes through the engine as the jet flies through the air helps the fuel to burn faster."
Model rocketry.
"Specific impulse is also used to describe how well model rocket motors work. In the table below are some of Estes' claimed values for specific impulses for several of their rocket motors: Estes Industries is a large, well known American seller of model rockets and rocket parts. The specific impulse for model rocket motors is much lower than for many other rocket motors because the black powder is used as a fuel. Black powder is used in model rocket motors because it costs less."
Larger Rocket Engines.
Here are some example numbers for larger rocket engines:
Units.
The most common way to measure specific impulse today uses seconds. This is used both in the SI (metric system) world as well as where English units are used. This way the units are identical everywhere. This means specific impulse can be used to compare engine performance in any country. Most companies that make rocket motors or jet engines use seconds to advertise their product’s performance.
"The other common way to measure specific impulse is in meters per second (m/s), which is also called effective exhaust velocity. For many engines the effective exhaust velocity is different from the speed that the gases actually come out of the nozzle."
Aromatic hydrocarbon
"An aromatic hydrocarbon, or arene, is a hydrocarbon ring compound. It has alternating double and single bonds between carbon atoms forming rings. Many of the compounds have a sweet scent, hence the term 'aromatic'. The ring of six carbon atoms in aromatic compounds is known as a benzene ring, after the simplest possible hydrocarbon ring, benzene. Aromatic hydrocarbons can be ""monocyclic"" (MAH) or ""polycyclic"" (PAH)."
"Some non-benzene-based compounds called heteroarenes, which follow Hückel's rule, are also aromatic compounds. In these compounds, at least one carbon atom is replaced by one of oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur."
Benzene ring model.
"Benzene, C6H6, is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon and was recognized as the first aromatic hydrocarbon, with the nature of its bonding first being recognized by Kekulé in the 19th century."
"Each carbon atom in the hexagonal cycle has four electrons to share. One goes to the hydrogen atom, and one each to the two neighboring carbons. This leaves one to share with one of its two neighboring carbon atoms, which is why the benzene molecule is drawn with alternating single and double bonds around the hexagon."
The structure is also illustrated as a circle around the inside of the ring to show six electrons floating around in delocalized molecular orbitals the size of the ring itself. This also represents the equivalent nature of the six carbon-carbon bonds each equivalent to ~1.5. The electrons are visualized as floating above and below the ring with the electromagnetic fields they generate acting to keep the ring flat.
General properties:
"The circle symbol for aromaticity was introduced by Sir Robert Robinson and his student James Armit in 1925 and popularized starting in 1959 by the Morrison &amp; Boyd textbook on organic chemistry. The proper use of the symbol is debated; it is used to describe any cyclic pi system in some publications, or only those pi systems that obey Hückel's rule on others."
Arene synthesis.
A reaction that forms an arene compound from an unsaturated or partially unsaturated cyclic precursor is simply called an aromatization. Many laboratory methods exist for the organic synthesis of arenes from non-arene precursors.
Importance of aromatic compounds.
"Aromatic compounds play key roles in the biochemistry of all living things. The four aromatic amino acids histidine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine each serve as one of the 20 basic building blocks of proteins. Further, all 5 nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil) that make up the sequence of the genetic code in DNA and RNA are aromatic purines or pyrimidines. As well as that, the molecule heme contains an aromatic system with 22 π electrons. Chlorophyll also has a similar aromatic system."
"Aromatic compounds are important in industry. Key aromatic hydrocarbons of commercial interest are benzene, toluene, ""ortho""-xylene and ""para""-xylene. About 35 million tonnes are produced worldwide every year. They are extracted from complex mixtures obtained by the refining of oil or by distillation of coal tar. They are used to produce a range of important chemicals and polymers, including styrene, phenol, aniline, polyester and nylon."
Types of aromatic compounds.
"Almost all aromatic compounds are compounds of carbon, but they need not be hydrocarbons."
"yeah,"
"I agree,"
"it's, it's pretty tough that way,"
"and, I know, even like with your school books and papers."
Uh-huh.
Do you miss your papers sometimes?
"See,"
yeah.
Uh-huh.
You know.
"That's the only thing I can really think about being an invasion of privacy, like something every day, though."
"Yeah,"
"well, actually I do know,"
and I have used it once
Uh-huh.
"and it, it really is an invasion of privacy,"
"but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live, their street address."
"Oh, really?"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"And that,"
"I mean, I've, I've used it once,"
"All right,"
"well do you play any musical instruments or,"
"No,"
I don't play any.
I used to.
"Oh well,"
I think everybody took piano lessons
"so,"
"Everybody,"
sure.
Uh-huh.
and everybody else in my area worked first shift
Uh-huh.
and our shifts overlapped
Uh-huh.
"so I would come in,"
"and there would be people sitting at my desk, working,"
"and I'm wondering, you know, um, what is this,"
"it's my vitamins,"
"I wonder, what is, you know, yeah, what is,"
"why are they working at my desk,"
and can I have it back.
Yeah.
"Can I have it back soon, maybe."
"Then you start missing stuff,"
and.
"Oh, yeah,"
"no mommy is going to take the vitamins,"
"I'm sorry,"
I have
That's okay.
"See that would, that would make me really mad,"
"because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff,"
"just because,"
"I mean, I know I have everything like a certain way"
and you know how it looks and everything.
"Oh, yeah."
"Well, you know how you left it the day before."
Uh-huh. child_talking
"That would bother me, definitely."
"Oh, yeah,"
"so, that's, child_talking"
And when he retires I'm retiring.
"Well, as soon as I get my quarters in, I'm, retiring period,"
Uh-huh.
"that's it,"
Yeah.
"you know, no more"
"Well, but, the,"
"did you, did you go to Florida in a van?"
As though
Uh-huh
"And we wanted to travel,"
"well, that was really nice traveling"
"but you know, I like to know more, I mean, hear about more people that have things like that you know?"
Yeah.
"And see what they think of them,"
the different kinds
Yeah.
"because I've only ridden in the one,"
"What, what kind was it?"
that's it.
"Uh, shoot"
I can't even think of the name of it now.
"What, what was remarkable, this van, even with, the,"
"we have two kids,"
and we went to Disney World
Uh-huh.
"uh, actually I grew up in Alabama,"
"and I went to see my mother,"
"and then went on down to Disney World,"
"and it got better than, I think twenty-two, twenty-three miles a gallon."
"And this was with the air conditioner on and, and you know four people with, with luggage,"
Yeah.
"Where, where are you?"
I'm in Dallas.
"Oh, yeah."
Are you in Dallas also?
"No,"
I'm in San Antonio.
"Oh, really,"
okay.
I get my news from a combination of sources.
I take the paper every day
Uh-huh.
"and I read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool."
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, and I watch the, uh, actually I watch the morning news before I leave for work."
"And then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something from the news."
Uh-huh.
"I normally find that uh, I'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
"so I don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch."
"I, I find that I have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because I used to get it during the week"
Uh-huh.
"but, um, I would always end up arriving at work late, because I would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time, reading it in the morning."
Yeah.
"So I have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work."
"Um, the MACNEIL LEHRER news hour is on public television"
Uh-huh.
and I enjoy that quite a bit.
Yeah.
"Um, one of the women that I work with, her husband is Iranian."
Uh-huh.
So here lately with all the Middle Eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch.
"I will admit I work with, uh, someone who's Iranian,"
"Oh,"
Do you all just start planning real far ahead of time?
Pardon.
"Uh, do you all start planning real far ahead of time?"
"Well, no."
There is kind of a set pattern to it.
"There is, uh,"
"so, uh, the day it happens is ninety-eight percent of the planning usually."
"Oh, really"
Yeah.
"Uh, we, uh, get together, at the, uh, the park, uh, the, uh, the park, and playground area of the Church I was raised in"
Yeah.
"and, uh, everybody brings lots of food"
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat
Eat a lot.
"Oh, gosh."
It is a lot harder for us because we are like I said we are spread out
Yeah.
"and so we have to plan anywhere from six, well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone, can uh, start their, uh, vacation time."
Schedule vacation time
and yeah.
We
"uh, Sat, uh, Sunday afternoon or, uh, sometimes it has been like on a Saturday afternoon."
Uh-huh.
"Usually, it is like Sunday afternoon"
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops to get there and back.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
"is that one of your, uh,"
"I mean, uh,"
"Well, where I am calling from is southern Mississippi."
"So, we have got, uh, uh, my wife and I have, uh, a bit longer ways to go than most."
"Yes,"
"we're, we're smarter now."
We know what we can do
"Yeah,"
"right,"
"uh, so let's see."
So mine I don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here.
Uh-huh.
"And so the second question, forgot what the second question,"
"What was it, uh,"
what do the trends in families
"and do we approve what other, families do."
"Well, uh, the trends in the families were to spread apart, do your own thing."
That's right.
"But I have seen  lately, yes, I am seeing, I'm seeing a change that, whoops, government can't do it,"
A change?
I was going to say the same thing.
schools are not able to
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"and between a person's religion, uh, their, their faith in their maker whether, you know, uh, whether you're Christian or Jewish  or whatever, uh,"
Right.
Right.
and the family
"Are going to have to solve some of the problem, huh."
"those are the two that can, that, that have the wherewithal"
"and, of course, Judeo-Christianity, uh, and of the Jewish folks, too, believe that the family unit is the one that was given the, uh, uh, mission by the Lord to do this very thing."
Uh-huh.
"So when another group of, of, uh, people step in, try to do it, they're, they're tromping on our territory, so to speak,"
so
Oh.
"I firmly believe that, uh,"
and then he goes home
"and, and, uh, you know, in the, in worst cases he's got parents either on drugs or, or something like that,"
Right.
or they don't care.
"You know, mamma, guess what I did in school today,"
"well who cares, you know."
"An a lot of it, a lot of the parents now are so young."
True.
"You know, that they're, they still, they still don't know what's going on"
"and how are they supposed to, you know, teach their kids that are coming up, you know, what's going on."
"I mean it's just, it's a vicious cycle, that we're, you know, dead, smack dead in the center of"
Yeah.
and we have to try to swim out.
"You know, kind of like the Bermuda Triangle,"
we're just sinking
and it's almost impossible to swim back up.
Yeah.
"But, um, yeah,"
"there's definitely problems,"
Yeah
"I'm,"
"its just the solutions that, you know, they're going to be in our political system,"
"they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while, too long."
"I don't know if you've ever had too much to do with, uh, oh, especially Asian, Japanese families coming,"
"here in Plano we've got, uh, quite a few."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
"Uh, engineering types, people who have come from Japan,"
Right.
and they put their kids in the U S schools
and they're appalled.
Uh-huh.
Yeah
"And we ended up with these, these, like things on the cantaloupe vines that, I mean, were looked like round big huge round cucumbers."
"Oh, that's really weird."
"Yeah,"
"I mean, there, these were like some mutant."
I've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden
and like I'll make an L shape I've put my cantaloupe.
So they've been pretty close together.
Huh.
But I don't think the vines.
"They don't they don't have to be touching or anything,"
"like you say, they cross pollinate just by bees,"
"No,"
"it's just the, like the bees and insects will do it."
"Um,"
Either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something.
Something weird.
Yeah.
"This year, this last season it was too wet up here"
Uh-huh.
"we lost a lot of our root things, our squash and our potatoes,"
and we got half our yield.
"Oh, well."
It was really bad because of the water.
"Yeah,"
"when I,"
"my family used to live in Littleton, Massachusetts,"
"and when we moved in there we had a, a really wet backyard,"
"and, uh, my mom wanted a vegetable garden."
"So we trucked in, uh,"
"I think it was seven, what was it, cubic, seven yards, cubic yards,"
I think that's how they measure dirt
"Well, I think sometimes through groups and organizations, um,"
"my first, when I first thought of it, I thought it, uh, when they asked the question I thought, well that sounds wonderful."
"And then, I wondered if people were unwilling"
"but, but I think even if you went in with a negative attitude I don't think it would stay negative very long."
"Um, but I do know through some organized groups like Scouts and church um, they, do still have opportunities."
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
that's probably true  You know
"But, I, I think that's a small, uh, number could,"
"but even, even through those groups, do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to?"
"No,"
"um, not since, um, not as much as I remember growing up."
"And that was something, uh, I think in the fifties and sixties, um, seemed more common in the last two decades."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
I think that's probably true.
"But,"
"I think it's probably more true, still in the, in the smaller communities then in the larger cities."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"Where, uh, where abouts do you live?"
What part of the country?
"Well, I live in Richardson right now. Which is just,"
"Oh, okay."
We're in Plano
so we're not far apart.
Right.
"Yeah,"
okay.
"One of the calls I'd gotten before was, uh, down to Austin"
"and, and I know, a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest"
so I know there is the possibility that it could be out of the area.
Uh-huh.
I want to move up quick.
I want to make money quick.
I want to retire quick.
Yeah.
"And so anything,"
"when the age creeps up, where I'm twenty-three and twenty-four,  I'm thinking my time is running out. You know,"
Uh-huh.
"but I'm actually very, very young."
"Yeah,"
"you are, because what I was going to say is, what you will find is, my background is in journalism and corporate communications,"
Uh-huh.
"and what you'll find is,"
"I mean, I'm just now finally to a point where,"
"I mean I don't know why I didn't, didn't do it sooner,"
Uh-huh.
"but this is probably typical of the women's movement too,  is the idea that you're going to be forty tomorrow anyway, if you want to go back to school."
Uh-huh.
"I'm seriously considering going back to school for law.  Um, which is a complete, I wouldn't say career change, it's, it's a subway ,"
Um.
Uh-huh.
but it's still is a different application.
"And I mean, if you think about it, you know, I I still can have another career."
I mean I've worked for over fifteen years in what I've done.
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"And I mean, so when you're saying quick, um, I think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine,  is thinking that, um, they have to do you know, sort of,  I call kind of, I call it a chewing syndrome."
Uh-huh.
Right.
They have to eat real fast
"they have,  they have to, rapidity of speech,"
"Uh-huh,"
No.
"Actually I'm a spectator,"
"and I'm a second hand spectator as a result of my first husband's, or my late husband's, interest in golf."
Uh-huh.
"My husband likes golf also,"
"he's, uh, I guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it"
"But he, he limits it pretty good."
"I, um, have tried to go out and play golf."
"He would love it if I would go out and play with him,"
"but I stand there and swing and swing,"
Uh-huh.
and I can't even hit the ball
I can't even play miniature golf well.
"Yeah,"
I don't either
"Well, there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not,"
but I am very good at watching it on television.
Right.
"And he was really, uh, enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments."
"He could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held, and what the nature of the hole was and,"
"Oh, so he's really into it."
"Oh, yeah,"
he was a good golfer.
Wow.
"And as, and did some, you know, instructions at the country club for a while."
Oh.
"But, uh, golf tended to be"
"I am not really deeply involved in any, following any of the sports."
Yeah.
"But golf was one that I developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers,"
and therefore I enjoyed following those particular players.
"Right,"
"Yeah,"
"it, it really is."
"Really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the, off the price, if you want to think of it that way."
Uh-huh.
"So when we get like, uh, uh, a twelve pack, then that's like twelve cents back."
"Yeah,"
so you guys can actually get ahead
Yeah
"But, uh, they have sort of like, uh, things that you you're not like reimbursed for or paid for."
"Like we can recycle, uh, clear glass, brown glass, green glass. Uh, and milk jugs and, uh, newspapers, you know,"
Yeah.
everyone does newspapers.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
everybody does newspapers.
"But, that, that kind of stuff."
Yeah.
"But they, they said they can't be smashed or else, uh,"
it doesn't fit in their little containers
"and they're not reimbursed by the, the people who are over them or something."
"Well, shoot, maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed, uh, Pepsi cans and whatever up there"
Yeah
"Exactly,"
"yeah,"
"send it to this address,"
no
"But, uh, let's see,"
"they said that, how, ways, can encourage recycling, uh,"
"I, I, I tell you what, what really works, uh, at least down here is, if there is, if there is some, even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it, you know what I mean, then people tend to do it. Uh,"
"Yeah,"
"that's,"
"In other words, taking care of the environment is, is all well and good"
Right.
Yeah.
"And I suspect it, in cases like,"
"I guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil."
Is that right?
"Well, I, I, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme."
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Well, uh, in the case of, civil, uh, things, I think maybe the, the use of the jury is very, often to the lawyer's advantage"
"and I think that may be where jury use is overdone,"
"I mean there are cases where they could be settled,  maybe  out of court a little more efficiently."
Right.
"But the lawyers are really, uh,"
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible
"so. Uh, I was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases not just sentencing in, in a criminal cases."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not so sure I'm in favor of that."
But I am in favor of it for criminal cases
so there's a difference of my view there for those two.
Right.
Right.
"Yeah,"
well you can tell I haven't been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that
Have you ever had to serve jury duty?
well I was called once when I was nineteen
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, but I was doing so many other things that they took pity on me"
"and, I was doing school and things like"
"they, they let me out."
Uh-huh.
I've never had to it since
"actually they, they fold, so when you get in tight situations, you can fold them back."
"Yeah,"
But they're
"well, see that's the reason we couldn't make, really make them,"
"at first we were going to get a pick up truck, with a camper on the back of it, of it,"
uh-huh.
"but then that gas mileage was just atrocious,"
"I mean it's, unreal,"
Uh-huh.
"it's, it just practically don't get any."
"Well, they have got, some of the newer ones they, you know, with the aerodynamic features,"
"you can get pretty, pretty decent gas mileage."
Yeah.
"And then, uh, he talked about a van,"
"and I said, well, you know, I don't know, I don't know how the gas is on most of these."
And another thing was
"that's the reason I said you know, there was such a big difference you know, in a little economy car,"
but I said maybe we might have to get us an economy car to pull along when we went somewhere.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
But really and truly the safety features
"but I wouldn't get one that,"
"if it had, the seat belts on the door now I wouldn't get it."
Yeah.
Period.
"Ford now announced I think in ninety-two, they're going to put, uh, air bags in their, in their vans."
Oh that would be good.
"So, uh, and I think, I, I believe safety,"
"I, I, I, I really do believe in this stuff, uh,"
"and I, I think it can go, ,"
"I'm not,"
"but they were so, seemed, cold and impersonal,"
I just couldn't hack it.
Uh-huh.
"And what I liked about Preston Hollow is that the people that were there when Cheryl was two, which was fifteen years ago, many of them are still there today."
So there  was real continuity.
Oh.
She went back as a teenager
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there.
"Oh, my gosh."
"So, it, it was really neat."
But it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love
"and  she just kept good people and  real cheerful place, lots of arts and crafts,"
Uh-huh.
Oh my goodness
and I'm really glad my kids had it because Plano schools do so little of that.  That if they hadn't had it before they hit first grade they were never going to have any art or music or any of the interpretive stuff.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"that is, uh, a big drawback I think in that, in the, uh, public schools out here. You know, to,"
Uh-huh.
you're lucky to have an art teacher
"and if you do you get them once a week or something, you know."
Or pay for it after school.
Our Emily's in the third grade over at Huffman
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take French and music and art
"and   you know, I willingly did it"
Oh is that right?
I had no idea.
"but I thought, this makes me angry."
This is something that ought to be in the schools  rather than some of the other stuff they do.
Exactly.
"And, then her little brother's only two years behind"
Exactly.
"and he says, well, I don't know,"
I think that I probably want to be a veterinarian.
"And I said, that's great."
Let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that.
"That's right,"
That's right
"Well, you know, T I, you know, T I offers some good stuff"
"and then I think there's, I mean I think there's some negatives,"
"but there's going to be some negatives anywhere, you know, no matter where you go."
"I have, you know, all,"
this is the first really large company I've worked for. I've
"always been involved in little small, you know, privately owned owned firms"
"and so I've never had the, the big benefit package."
"So, I really don't know how to compare it to other big companies, you know."
"It, when I came on it was great because I had never had anything even close to what, what they offered."
"So, I've been real pleased."
"Well, that's fantastic,"
Yeah.
"and on whole I would say that they're equal to, uh, most of our competitors."
Think so?
"Uh, I can see some, some potential changes that probably are, are, would not cost very much but might, uh, make things a little easier. Such as offering a, a smorgasbord. Having a larger variety of benefits"
Uh-huh.
"but, but here's the amount, that, that T I is going to pay for it,"
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
and you can pick what you want
"and, yeah."
now it's up to you
"it's menu selection, so, to speak."
"and they cut each others throats until they're, they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat."
"And, uh, well, of course, that's getting away from taxes isn't it,"
that's government controlled.
"But, uh,"
"Well, I, I think another thing too that, um, I've had a little contacted with, uh,"
"in regard to taxes let's say that, uh, you have something that the I R S disagrees with or, you know, says, hey, we're not going to allow that."
"Well, I think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you, you will not only payback that that you wrote off"
but you will at least double that amount
"and,"
"Oh, by the time you get through with the, uh the penalties."
Yes.
"And that's, to me there's something wrong there, you know."
Yeah.
"I mean, I can see paying the interest and some small penalty"
but they really stick it to you big time.
"Uh, I agree."
"I think the I R S is, uh, just too powerful."
There should be some sort of a control on it.
And they should be a little more humane.
Uh-huh.
Absolutely.
"Uh, the, uh, typical bureaucratic, I guess. That's, that's one of my pet peeves."
"I came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the, the budget."
Uh-huh.
Very simple.
"Give, uh, uh, uh, government employees the average number of, uh, holidays as the, uh, private industry."
Yeah.
"I mean, you think about it now,"
"they, they get about sixteen holidays a year."
That's a lot.
It sure is.
"And I think here at TI we get, what is it nine or ten?"
And they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down.
"And that's the way to do it, too."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"I think it's, you know what's I think is so nice is that in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you"
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen.
Yeah.
"And, And it makes an awful lot of difference, doesn't it?"
"Preparing it,"
right.
"Oh, it sure does."
"Well,"
"Well, when I was brought up, you know, we didn't,"
"Uh, go ahead,"
tell me what you think.
Do we get our money's worth?
"Hey, listen, if I had my way, I wouldn't pay my taxes."
"Not with the, not with some of the things that I hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things."
"Yeah,"
did you see SIXTY MINUTES last night?
"No,"
I did not.
"I,"
"Well, they did a thing on the thirty-five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need."
"And, uh, it's staggering."
"Well, how does this grab you? How did this grab you?"
"Uh, this,"
"I, I mean, I'm, I'm a lady,"
"but this, I heard this on a Christian program"
"and it was, uh, about the N E A"
"and, that's the National Endowment for Arts,"
"and they fund, they funded this thing, this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money."
"it wasn't really pollution, just the steamy weather <laughter>."
"Oh absolutely,"
"yeah,"
just muggy.
"So, yes"
"I think,"
"yeah,"
I think you're right.
Our most pollute substance down here is just water.
"But I I, I, I think, you know, the biggest causes even then a lot of times are, uh, uh, like when I was up in Boston just all the cars. You know, just all over the place."
Yeah
"it,"
"You just got a lot of, you know, a lot of pollution from those"
"and, uh, you know, if you don't have a wind, it sticks around."
"Oh, yeah."
"I, you know, I was in Boston once"
"and I remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour, even with the Tee."
"Uh, just this, it looked like billions of cars massing"
Absolutely.
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go.
"I mean, yeah, that's what's in, you know, Los Angeles is,"
I think that's biggest problem
"because when I was in Los Angeles for a time, it's all, you know, from Los Angeles to San Diego it's like all city."
Right.
"And there's really, there's nowhere for this to be absorbed, really."
"Uh, tree planting sometimes can handle, you know, stopping some of the air pollution and that and help"
but if you have nowhere to do anything.
"That's, that's very true."
"Uh, you know, of course then when, when you're not recycling, you've got these incendiary plants and stuff, that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere."
"But I, you know, you've got, you've got the industry,"
"you've got that,"
and you got the cars.
"Well, that's nice comfortable stuff."
Yes.
"Open shirt, open at the neck, you know, no tie."
Wow.
"And, uh, just, uh, reasonable looking, how shall I say it, uh, sports clothes or some guys wear, some people even wear Levis."
Wow.
That's nice.
"Now, being from Philadelphia, I don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed, right?"
Well actually right now I'm a full time college student
"so my dress code is very, very (( ))."
"Oh, okay."
"Yeah,"
I usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime.
"But over the summers I've had a job, internships with the newspaper."
Uh-huh.
"And that's so,"
"generally then I dress, you know, nicer."
"Usually nice summer slacks or more, sometimes skirts, stuff like that."
"So, then it's still, you know, the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming out of office"
but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing. To go out to meet people and interview people and stuff like that
Yes.
so.
"Yeah,"
"well I, uh, I just recently applied for a different job in the company here"
and so I decided well I'd wear a suit.
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
"And it, it was very interesting,"
"uh, like I said, most of the people at, at this company don't wear suits."
"Uh, most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual, almost the same clothes that, that you'd wear to school."
Wow.
That must be nice atmosphere then.
Yeah.
"And they sell, I guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it."
Yeah.
"But I wish that, uh, more of the cans, you know, like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable."
"I don't,"
a lot of that's that recyclable steel
and I don't know anybody that takes that.
"Yeah,"
that's true .
my husband likes Pepsi
"and those cans are steel instead of aluminum,"
"so we can't, can't ever recycle them."
I think it's a good reason to quit buying it.
"Um, now I didn't know that,"
"cause we just usually if we're going to, uh, buy sodas they're in the, the two liter bottles."
"Yeah,"
"that's what we buy the most of, unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to, put the cans in a cooler"
Yeah.
"But, well that's all I can really think about for recycling."
Okay.
It was good talking to you.
Okay.
"Uh, bye."
"All right,"
bye-bye. voice said what's that
"voice said, where were they"
There you go.
What do you think invades your privacy? heavily
"Oh, well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something. You know, that, that try to sell you the newspaper, and, uh, carpet cleaning, and, uh, what else, roof repair"
"And enough,"
"well I think it's a waste of paper, the people that always leave, uh, junk mail and, because, um, you just end up throwing it away most of the time."
"Probably eighty percent of the, the junk mail that you get is, is, um, something that you don't need."
"We like to put our, just put our newspapers in a paper bag, you know, and then carry them up there that way."
Uh-huh.
And we have to bring the paper bags back every time. Because they won't take them.
Yeah.
"Do you, uh, take your papers somewhere"
or does someone pick them up?
"We, we usually collect a, you know, collect a quite a bit"
"and then we take them, take them in."
Uh-huh.
"We, um, we don't take our cans up to that center, though,"
"our aluminum cans, we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them."
"Yeah,"
"we don't, we don't, um, use aluminum cans,"
Uh-huh.
"so, we generally don't have those to do."
"Yeah,"
"it takes us about a year to save up enough to be worth, you know, worth bothering to go in and do,"
"but. Do you, um, have any ideas on anything that would make,"
"You know, they, they charge you, you know,"
it's like a flat rate I think for picking up your garbage.
Uh-huh.
"And I know a lot of people it would, would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup"
and some communities are trying to do that now.
"And I think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling,"
Right.
"they, they charged you by, by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill."
Yeah
that would be a good idea.
That that might be a better way to do it.
Yeah.
"And then people would, would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash."
Right.
there's a point on which we don't agree.
Uh-huh.
"I would tend, myself, to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, anytime a, one of the parties wants one."
Uh-huh.
"And I, usually it is the defendant, I guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case."
Sure.
"So I'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, uh, take that, you know,"
"that would require a change in the Bill of Rights, I believe"
"and so,"
"and, and I wasn't, I didn't mean that"
"Oh, oh, okay."
"I, I didn't mean that, no."
"Because, I mean, gee whiz, if I was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that, oh"
"yes, I would feel, uh, you're right, that my civil rights had been violated."
"But I meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here."
"We're not going to have a jury, you know,"
let's get it over with.
"Sort of like car accidents, you know,"
Right.
Well I think that's all ready possible.
Yeah.
"I think, that you can waive the right to a, jury trial uh,"
yeah
right
so. I agree that that should be encouraged.
Uh-huh.
People should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial.
"But I think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into  giving a different sentence or possibly, if it's a civil case, giving higher, uh, you know, awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the, the award."
Right.
Giving a different sentence.
Uh-huh.
The take.
"an, and that turns out okay."
Yeah.
"And it's funny 'cause if I turn them out on to a on to like a plate, for them to take what they want, they don't know I've ever done it in a microwave."
Uh-huh.
"It's really funny,"
"it's very deceiving, you know, 'cause if they see it with their eyes they go, uh, I don't like want that, you know,"
Yeah
"and yet if they don't ever see it, then it's like, oh this tastes okay, you know,"
so.
Yeah.
Anyway.
"We had,"
my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash.
"Everybody would say we don't like squash, we won't eat squash,"
"so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there, you know,"
Yeah
"and then we'd go, oh, this is really good."
Okay.
"Uh it's not such a bad idea to think about judges, uh, you know, taking the idea of, uh, uh, sentencing into their hands versus, you know, the jury, especially if it's a highly publicized case such as, uh, you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read, uh, certain, uh, things in regards to cases like the Dahlmer case in Milwaukee and stuff."
"So it's, it may be an idea to think about, you know, cost."

"The Paris Public School, at Main and 1st Sts., North, in Paris, Idaho, is a historic school that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is a brick building. It was designed by architect Richard C. Watkins in Prairie School style and was built in 1918."
"It is significant partly for reflecting a local fad: the school, the Hotel Paris, the Les and Hazel Shepherd Bungalow, and the LDS Stake Office Building (all also NRHP-listed in Paris), reflect the Prairie style, which is otherwise relatively rare in Idaho. According to a 1980 study, the style's unusual popularity in Paris gives the city a sense of architectural unity. The same study called the Public School the best and most representative example of the Prairie School in the city."

Lucas subsequently worked as a manager.
"Born in Camponaraya, Castile and León, Lucas' professional career was solely associated to two Galician clubs, RC Celta de Vigo and SD Compostela. After a loan to lowly Córdoba CF, he returned to the former for the 1981–82 season, scoring a career-best 26 goals in 37 games ""en route"" to a La Liga promotion."
"Lucas made his debut in the Spanish top flight on 5 September 1982, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–1 away loss against Sevilla FC.

= = = Pavol Horov Gymnasium = = =
"Pavol Horov Gymnasium () is an upper secondary school located in the city of Michalovce in Kosice Region, Slovakia. Established in 1922, it is the oldest Slovak Gymnasium east of the Mátra-Slanec Area and is one of two main providers of secondary school education in Michalovce, along with ""Gymnázium na ulici Ľudovíta Štúra""."
"Before the Czechoslovak declaration of independence on 28 October 1918, the area of surrounding the city of Michalovce was a part of the former Hungarian County of Kosice (). At that time, there was only three secondary schools in the entire county, all of which was purely Hungarian, located in the then cultural centers of Kosice, Presov and Uzhgorod."
"After becoming independent, patriotic sentiment ran high and Slovaks sensed immediately the need to establish a Slovak high school in the area, in order to provide higher education in Slovak language for the populace in eastern Slovakia. At first the choice stood between three sites in the Zemplin region, which were the cities of Humenne, Trebisov and Michalovce. Due to its ability to provide sufficient funds and staffing, Michalovce soon became the obvious choice for the construction of the new school."
"The new school was finished in 1922 and in the period 1922 - 1938 the school bore the name ""Czechoslovak state gymnasium."" At the stage, the education was conducted in a way that emphasized the idea of the single Czechoslovak nation, and the language taught was the ""českoslovenčina"", or Czechoslovak language.The School's administrators constantly struggled with finding teachers with sufficient qualifications, teaching post was often filled with engineers, and often the school was dependent on the assistance of local school teachers."
"In 1931, the school marked its first graduating class, of the 22 students, 18 managed to graduate. Seven years later the school was markedly affected by the First Vienna Award, which saw the departure of all Czech professors along with their families from Michalovce. These were highly skilled academics which undoubtedly contributed to the high reputation of the school."
"Following the Munich treaty in November 1938, the Name of the school was changed to ""Slovak real high school"" (). In connection with the events of Munich, the beginning of the 1938-39 school year the school was occupied by the army (mobilization). Teaching was suspended from 24 September 1938 to 10 October 1938. After the First Vienna Award the new students came from schools from the Hungarian territories, (mainly Uzhhorod)."
"After Slovak students started moving to nearby Sobrance and the number of classes was reduced from 19 to 16 by April 1939, teaching in at the school year was interrupted again. When Hungarian troops invaded Slovakia on March 23, 1939 and the subsequent Slovak–Hungarian War, Slovak troops occupied the school and returned Slovak language to the curriculum. This education highlighted growing Slovak national consciousness and nationalism. At this time the Head teacher was also the government commissioner of Michalovce and later the leader of the Hlinka Youth (Slovak paramilitary scout movement, modeled after the Hitler Youth). In school year 1939/40 that organization counted 118 of the schools students. Two years later the count was 590 boys and girls. In 1944 it was 694 students out of a total 875. Influenced in part by the ideas of Slovak nationalist Andrej Hlinka, Catholicism became an important part of the school year, the year began with worship of Veni Sancte Spiritus, a school celebration, ending a solemn Te Deum. During the closing phase of World War II, the school became a military hospital for the Wehrmacht, and after November 1944, for the Red Army."

"Joe Colombo, born Cesare Colombo (30 July 1930 – 30 July 1971) was an Italian industrial designer."
"Cesare ""Joe"" Colombo was until 1949 educated at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera, the academy of fine arts, in Milano as a painter and studied afterwards until 1954 Architecture at Politecnico di Milano University."
"In 1951 he joined the ""Movimento Nucleare"", founded by Sergio D´Angelo and Enrico Baj. The following four years Colombo was active as a painter and sculptor of the abstract Expressionism and exhibited his works with other members in Milano, Torino, Verviers, Venice and Brussels."
"In 1955 Colombo joined the Art Concret group, but gave up his painting to promote his Design Career. Before he cooperated at an exhibition for the tenth Triennale of 1954 and documented the Ceramic Designs of an international meeting in Albisola. For his presentation Colombo created for example three exterior seatings which were combined with a ""shrinelike"" presentation of TVs."
"In 1959, Colombo had to take over the family company, which produced electric appliances, and started to experiment with new construction and production technologies. In 1962 Colombo opened his own interior design and architecture projects, mostly for lodges and skiing."
"Colombo designed products for Oluce, Kartell, Bieffe, Alessi, Flexform and Boffi."
Colombo died in 1971 on his 41st birthday.
"Together with his brother Gianni, Colombo developed the idea of prismatic lamps like the lamp ""Acrilica""(1962). His first design for Kartell was the chair ""No.4801"" (1963–1967) which consisted of three assembled plywood elements. The flowing elements of his chair were a foretaste of his later plastic designs, like the chair ""universale No.4860"" (1965–1967), which was the first seating for adults made of ABS."
"Moreover, Colombo produced innovative designs for furniture, lamps, glass, doorknobs, pipes, alarm clocks, and wristwatches. He created the professional camera ""Trisystem"" (1969), the air conditioner ""Candy"" (1970), dinnerware for Alitalia (1970; still in use), as well as an ergonomic and engined printing table."
"Since the beginning of his career Colombo was most interested in living systems. His early modular container ""Combi-Centre"" of 1963 is an example for that. This preference for furniture systems led to designs like ""Additional Living System"" (1967–1968) and the chairs ""Tube"" (1969–1970) and ""Multi"" (1970), which could be assembled in various positions to get a great number of sitting positions."
"After more than a century of service to Roman Catholics of Polish descent in the Manayunk, Roxborough, and Wissahickon areas of the greater Philadelphia area, St. Josaphat's Parish was merged with St. John the Baptist and St. Mary of the Assumption in 2012."
"This church also operated a parish elementary school until June 2005 when that school was closed due to its low enrollment of 130 students. The Reverend Monsignor John Wendrychowicz, the pastor of Saint Josaphat Parish at the time, informed parishioners of the decision in Masses held during the weekend of April 25, 2005, noting that he had also informed teachers and families of the children attending the school he had secured support from the Parish Pastoral and Finance Councils to request permission from Cardinal Justin Rigali, Archbishop of Philadelphia, to close the facility. Students enrolled in Saint Josaphat School at the time were given the option to attend any other parish elementary school for the 2005-2006 school year. A new regional Catholic school, the Holy Child Catholic School, also opened in September 2005. Cardinal Rigali, who granted permission for the closure, said of his decision:"
"""I am grateful to Monsignor Wendrychowicz and Monsignor Beach, for their leadership in making this recommendation to close Saint Josaphat School. I recognize it was guided by a desire for careful stewardship of parish resources and for the pastoral care of parents, children and staff of the school. It is my hope that parents will continue to choose a quality, Catholic education for their children and I pray that the parishioners of St. Josaphat and all the faithful of Manayunk will continue to support Catholic education and be guided by the Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior during this transition."""

The Khamnigan are only ethnic group of Tungus origin in Mongolia. They who lived around Nerchinsk and the Aga steppe faced both Cossack demands for tribute and Khori-Buriats trying to occupy their pastures. Most of them came under the Cossack rule and enrolled the Cossack regiments in the Selenge valley. The Khori Buriats occupied most of the Aga steppe and forced the Ewenkis to flee to the Qing Dynasty."
"After 1880 Russia's Khamnigan Evenks moved to semi nomadic herding of cattle, sheep, camels and horses. Some time after 1918 the Evenks, along with their Buriat neighbors, fled over the border into Mongolia and Hulun Buir, establishing the current Khamnigan communities there. The Khamnigan of Mongolia, numbering 300 households, are scattered among the Buriats and speak only the Khamnigan dialect of Buriat language.

In the 1974 New Year Honours, Kennedy was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to journalism."
"Kennedy was known for his socially-conservative stance on issues like homosexuality and abortion. During his career as editor of ""Tablet"", he also had a close friendship with Prime Minister Robert Muldoon and the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children president Des Dalgety. During the Muldoon era, ""The Tablet"" adopted a pro-Muldoonist editorial standpoint and Muldoon himself contributed several articles. Muldoon himself supported ""The Tablet's"" position on private schools."
"Kennedy was also anti-Communist and was critical of Prime Minister David Lange's anti-nuclear policies, which he saw as weakening the ANZUS alliance and benefiting the Soviet Union. According to peace activist Maire Leadbeater, Kennedy passed information on left-wing groups like the Philippines Solidarity Group to the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service, the country's main domestic intelligence agency."
"Kennedy died on 20 March 1994. Following Kennedy's death, the ""Tablet"" struggled to maintain the level of support it had during his editorship. The newspaper ceased publication in April 1996."

"Diogo Veloso, or Diego Belloso in the Spanish historical accounts, (Amarante 1558 - Cambodja 1599) was a Portuguese adventurer active in Southeast Asia in the last quarter of 16th century, acting sometimes in the service of the Spanish Governor of the Spanish East Indies (within the Cambodian–Spanish War) and sometimes as a free-lancer. He and Spanish Blas Ruiz were the first Europeans to ever set foot in Laos."
"Veloso's journey to Laos started in Cambodia. In Cambodia, Veloso met and befriended King Satha of Lovek and Ruiz of Spain. When Lovek was invaded by Ayutthaya, Satha was overthrown by his son and other nobles who allowed Ayutthaya to take control, forcing Veloso to flee to Portuguese Malacca, the place where he began his adventure in Southeast Asia. Eventually Veloso returned with Ruiz, who had fled to Spanish Philippines, to Lovek. When they arrived they learned Satha had fled to Lan Xang, an empire centered in modern-day Laos and consisting of Isan, Stung Treng, and small areas of Southern China and Vietnam."
"Veloso and Ruiz decided to journey to Laos and bring back Satha to restore his reign over Lovek. They arrived in Vientiane, Lan Xang's administrative capital, in the summer of 1596. They were met with a procession showing off the city's immense wealth consisting of Asian elephants, gold, jewels, silk, exotic snakes, bouquets of tropical flowers, chanting monks, Buddhist treasures and relics, music, and beautiful women. Veloso and Ruiz were also received with a great feast. But while they were in Vientiane they learned Satha had died from an illness he caught on his way from Cambodia to Laos. Saddened and angered by the news, Veloso and Ruiz returned to Lovek and started a rebellion to put one of Satha's political allies on the throne and free Cambodia from Ayutthaya. They managed to drive out Ayutthaya forces from parts of Cambodia and create a new state but led the new Cambodian state into a brief period of chaos."
Eventually Veloso returned to Malacca.

"Parkhurst apprentices were juvenile prisoners from Parkhurst Prison, sentenced to ""transportation beyond the seas"", but pardoned on arrival at their destination on the conditions that they be ""apprenticed"" to local employers, and that they not return to England during the original term of their sentence. Between 1842 and 1849, Western Australia accepted 234 Parkhurst apprentices, all males aged between 10 and 21. As Western Australia was not then a penal colony, contemporary documents studiously avoided referring to the prisoners as ""convicts"", and the ships that brought them were not officially recognised as convict ships there. English records were not so reticent, classing as convict ships the seven ships that transported Parkhurst apprentices to Western Australia."

The university offers more than 70 undergraduate majors and seven graduate programs. Walsh has a satellite campus in Castel Gandolfo, Italy."
The school's namesake is Bishop Emmett Michael Walsh of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Youngstown.
"Walsh University was first founded as LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine in 1951 by the Brothers of Christian Instruction on an idea by Ferdinand Waldo Demara, who was then posing as a monk, to educate young men as brothers and teachers. LaMennais College continued in Alfred, Maine from 1951 until 1959. Because of a chance 1957 conversation between Brother Francoeur of La Mennais College and Monsignor William Hughes of Youngstown, Ohio about the Brothers' wish to move LaMennais College from Alfred, Maine, Bishop Walsh invited the Brothers to choose Canton, Ohio as the new location. Bishop Walsh donated $304,000 to the Walsh College project. In 1959 the present location of Walsh University began as of farm land on which two buildings were constructed, College Hall (Farrell Hall) and LaMennais Hall which continues to house the Brothers and international priest-students. The Founding Brothers include: Dacian J. Barrette, Thomas S. Farrell, Henry J. Vannasse, Edmond Drouin, Paul E. Masse, Robert A. Francoeur, and Alexis Guilbeault."
"Throughout the school's history, the Brothers have played an active role, serving as faculty during the original years and playing a part in the growth and development of facilities and programs. Several have served as President."

"Kuok Khoon Hong (; born 1949) is a Singaporean business magnate, entrepreneur and philanthropist. He is the co-founder, Chairman and CEO of Wilmar International, having built it into Asia's leading agribusiness and the ""world's largest palm oil trader"". He is also the Chairman of Perennial Real Estate Holdings Ltd. He has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion as of March 2019."
"Kuok earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree from the National University of Singapore, and began his career in 1973 trading soft commodities at Kuok Oils and Grains. He eventually became Managing Director of the business, and developed the Pasir Gudang Edible Oils refining complex in Johor, followed by China's first edible oil refinery, South Seas Oils and Fats."
"In 1991, he left the Kuok Group to start Wilmar, with Martua Sitorus soon after coming on board as a co-founder. Starting as a small commodities trading company with S$2m in seed capital from the mortgage of his family home, and further seed funding obtained from Kuok Hock Swee and Sons, his father's investment company. Wilmar grew rapidly from the outset, with initial growth in the Indonesian edible oil market, followed up with development of Sumatran oil palm plantations and Indonesian edible oil refineries. A large expansion into edible oil refining in mainland China, and a joint venture with the Adani Group in India subsequently placed it in leading positions within Asia's largest consumer edible oil markets. In 1994, a meeting with the legendary then-chairman of ADM, Dwayne Andreas, resulted in a US$30m investment into the company after the first meeting, and ADM coming on board as a long term strategic partner."
"In 2006, Wilmar International launched an Initial Public Offering on the Singapore Stock Exchange with a capitalisation of S$2.38Bn. In 2007, after a 16-year estrangement, he agreed with his uncle Robert Kuok to merge the Kuok Group's edible oil, trading and oil palm plantation assets into Wilmar in return for a 31% stake in the company. The merger resulted in the unification of Kuok's previous early career contributions to the Kuok Group with the rapidly growth of Wilmar International led by him and Martua Sitorus since 1991."
"Kuok's family investment vehicle HPRY Holdings acquired the Aviva Tower in the City of London in 2011 in a joint purchase with Martua Sitorus valued at £290m. The property subsequently received planning approval by the City of London for redevelopment into the Eric Parry designed 'Trellis', slated to be at 1000 ft the tallest building in the City and the second tallest building in Western Europe."
"Besides holding stakes in music, media and biotechnology businesses, HPRY is a substantial shareholder in Perennial Real Estate Holdings, which is a developer of commercial mixed use integrated developments and healthcare projects in China. It owns several iconic properties in Singapore including CHIJMES, the Capitol and AXA Tower. HPRY was a seed/angel round investor in SEA Ltd, a SouthEast Asian gaming and internet unicorn listed on the NYSE, whose co-founder Ye Gang was a Wilmar employee at the time the business was created."
"Kuok was born in the seaside village of Mersing in Johor, Malaysia, the second of four children of Kuok Hock Swee and Tan Sek Meng. His father was a cousin of Malaysian billionaire Robert Kuok. He was educated at Sri Mersing Primary, St Joseph's School and the English College, Johor Bahru."
"His father, Kuok Hock Swee, had arrived in then British Malaya from Foochow in Southern China at the age of 18, eventually setting up a provision store in Mersing that he expanded into a thriving business distributing foodstuffs along the east coast of Peninsula Malaysia. This was subsequently merged with the Kuok Group in exchange for an equity stake in Robert Kuok's rapidly expanding business which by then included the first ShangriLa Hotel in Singapore."
"The Kuok family traces its ancestry to the 8th century Tang Dynasty general Guo Ziyi, whose descendants included several famous generals under Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Guo Ziyi was notably mentioned by the Nestorian Christians (known as the Church of the East) as perhaps the earliest high ranking patron of the Christian Church in Tang Dynasty China."
"Kuok is married with four children - 3 sons and 1 daughter. His second son, Kuok Meng Ru, is a Singapore-based music industry entrepreneur and investor, who co-founded the cloud-based music creation platform BandLab Technologies, and acquired the Asian music retail chain Swee Lee and a 49% stake in Rolling Stone Magazine."

"Gedion Zelalem (born January 26, 1997) is a German-born American professional soccer player who plays as a midfielder for Major League Soccer club New York City FC."
"After playing for various youth teams in Germany and the United States, Zelalem initially played with Arsenal's youth squads after joining the team in early 2013, and made his senior squad debut for Arsenal in an FA Cup match in January 2014."
"Internationally, Zelalem made appearances for Germany's under-15 team, under-16 team and under-17 team during 2012 and 2013. He became a U.S. citizen on December 2, 2014, and FIFA subsequently approved his eligibility to play for the United States on May 13, 2015."
"Zelalem was born in Berlin, Germany, to Ethiopian parents. He started playing football at the age of five for German club BFC Germania 1888. After this, he changed to Bundesliga side Hertha BSC's academy."
"Zelalem emigrated to the United States with his father in 2006, following his mother's death in the previous year, and settled in Washington, D.C.. He played with several teams: first with MSC United, Bethesda Soccer Club and BNC Revolution, before joining the elite club team Olney Rangers and the varsity team at Walter Johnson High School in Montgomery County, Maryland."
"Arsenal scout Danny Karbassiyoon discovered Zelalem in the United States playing for Olney Rangers during a Dallas Cup match. After contacting his coaches, Zelalem was flown to London for summer training with the Arsenal youth academy; following the end of this camp, he was offered a permanent place in the Academy. Zelalem started out playing in Arsenal's under-16s squad, before graduating into the under-21s in April 2013. His début for the under-21 side came against Liverpool U21 that month, but was unable to prevent Arsenal slipping to a 3–2 defeat at Anfield; however, he drew praise for his performance. He made his second appearance for the side less than a week later in a 3–2 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers U21, once again drawing praise for his performance."
"In July 2013, Zelalem was included in Arsenal's 24-man squad for their Asia tour. Although regarded as a surprise inclusion, strong performances against an Indonesia Dream Team, the Vietnam national team and Japanese side Nagoya Grampus led to him being touted as a future star, and being compared favorably to Cesc Fàbregas."
"Following these strong performances, Zelalem stated that he hoped to make a few appearances during the 2013–14 season. He remained in the team for the Emirates Cup match against Galatasaray on August 4, but was unable to keep Arsenal from sliding to a 2–1 defeat. Zelalem was selected on the bench in Arsenal's second Premier League game of the season, a 3–1 victory over Fulham on August 24, but did not make an appearance. However, on September 10 Zelalem announced on Twitter that he had sustained an injury that would keep him out of action for up to two months. Although he announced his return to training in late October, Arsène Wenger confirmed that he would not be fit enough for the League Cup match against Chelsea on October 29, dismissing a previous rumor. He returned to action for Arsenal's youth side a week later in a UEFA Youth League fixture against Borussia Dortmund on November 6, playing the entire match in a 2–2 draw."
"On January 24, 2014, Zelalem made his debut with Arsenal's senior squad, coming on as a substitute for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the 71st minute of their 4–0 home FA Cup victory against Coventry City. And later that year, on March 18, 2014, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal to last until 2017. Zelalem soon made his second appearance for Arsenal, coming on as a substitute in the beginning of the second half, in a 4–1 away win against Galatasaray in UEFA Champions League on December 9, 2014."
"On August 24, 2015, Zelalem was loaned to Rangers until January. He made his debut in a 5–0 win over Airdrieonians in the Scottish League Cup, setting up goals for Martyn Waghorn and James Tavernier. He made his league debut in Rangers' Scottish Championship game against Queen of the South which Rangers won 5–1. In January 2016 his loan was extended through to the end of the season."
"He played in 21 Championship matches, helping Rangers clinch the second-tier title, and was an unused substitute as they beat Peterhead 4–0 to win the 2015–16 Scottish Challenge Cup. A week later, Rangers played old firm rivals Celtic in the Scottish Cup semifinal. Zelalem converted a penalty in the shootout to help his club progress to the final, and started in that match, which Rangers lost 3–2 to Hibernian."
"On January 24, 2017, Zelalem signed a contract extension with Arsenal and accepted a loan move to Dutch second-tier club VVV-Venlo, lasting until the end of the season. He made nine league appearances as VVV Venlo won the 2016-17 Eerste Divisie title."
"After no first team appearances at Arsenal upon returning in 2017, Zelalem joined MLS club Sporting Kansas City for free on March 10, 2019."
"After Zelalem's option was not picked up by Sporting Kansas City, he signed for fellow Major League Soccer side New York City FC on January 11, 2020."
"Zelalem began training with the United States under-15 side in 2012, but was unable to play in matches at that time due to being classified as a permanent resident, but not yet a U.S. citizen. In May 2014, it was reported that Zelalem's father, Zelalem Wolydes, held U.S. permanent residency and intended to apply for U.S. citizenship. If Wolydes gained U.S. citizenship before his son turned 18, then under the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Gedion would also acquire U.S. citizenship and become eligible to represent the United States internationally. He would also be able to retain his German passport which allows him to live and work in the European Union without restrictions."

= = = Sambha gompa = = =
"Kamtsang Dargye Choekhorling Monastery, known locally as Sambha (Samba, Sampa) gompa (goenpa), is situated in Mustang district, Tukuche Village development committee (VDC), in the Western Development Region, Nepal. It is about within Tukuche town on the Annapurna trekking route/ gravel road from Pokhara to Jomsom in the Dhaulagiri zone. In 2013 the local higher secondary school, Shree Yogendra HSS was being expanded, and the entrance to the gompa is within the school site; off the main Beni Jomson road, west of the Kali Gandaki river."
"The founder of Sambha gompa is understood to have come from the DoKham area of Tibet, but his name is unknown. He lived in the village of Tukuche for some time and died during a period of mediation. Seven days after his death he became a rainbow body confirming his achievement of enlightenment. In 1935 the gompa was re-established by members of the Tulachan family."
The first and second incarnations (tulku) are understood to have been born into the Kharghar caste and came from Tibet.
3rd incarnation: Bhattachan family
During the tenure of the third incarnation the location of the gompa was moved to its current location. At the time there was no bridge and the river was difficult to cross. Therefore the villagers offered land to the monks to relocate the gompa within Tukuche village to ease their access.
"4th incarnation: Was from the Tulachan family based in Tukuche, whose given name was Karma Tashi Singye, but known locally as Dr Mangal Singh, having gained a medical doctorate in Switzerland. He died aged 49."
"5th incarnation: Born 28 years after the death of the previous incarnation, also from the Tulachan family in Tukuche has the monastic name Karma Dhomchhe Norbu Tenpi Gyaltshen Palsamgpo Rinpoche. He is the nephew of current head lama (2016) of Chhairo gompa Shashi Dhoj Tulachan. He was recognised by three senior rinpoches including Tai Situpa Rinpoche. He was enthroned aged 8 in 2004 in India."
"He is currently studying at Palpung Monastery in Himachal Pradesh under Kenting Tai Situpa. In order for the young tulku to be accepted by the thakali community, he needs to be enthroned in Sambha gompa, requiring extensive reconstruction of the residential quarters of the monastery."
"Lama Chh'eon-che, of the Gtsag Bris school of painting, was responsible for paintings on the wall behind the altar c. 1994."
"Other frescoes in the gompa depicting the sixteen Arhat on the south, north and eastern walls are by Khaipa Chhogyal, a distant relative of Kamal Dhoj Tulachan, Shashi Dhoj Tulachan's late father."
"Khaipa of Lupra is believed to have painted the Sin-yeb, but this painting no longer remains."
"Damaged roof timbers mean that water ingress has damaged many paintings in recent years. Although roof repairs commenced in 2015, this has yet to be completed due to lack of funds."
In 2013 there was very limited monastic activity. Tukuche has lost much of its population due to changes in trade routes and rural urban migration suffered by many small villages. This first occurred in the 1960s when China tried to restrict movement of Tibetans and most recently during the 2008 Olympics.
"Lama Shashi Dhoj Tulachan an artist from Tukuche village, is responsible for the continued management of the gompa and is seeking support for its physical and spiritual renovation, in addition to the restoration work at Chhairo gompa which he is also responsible for."
"A nun (anim) who also takes care of Rani gompa, looks after the site."
There is a part time monk sponsored by the current Ven Gyalpo Rinpoche who undertakes monastic rituals as required.
To the south of the monastery are the historical residential quarters for the monk body.
These facilities are not currently habitable and the courtyard is used for general storage from the gompa next door.
The gompa was restored in the 2000s.
"A stupa was constructed in the courtyard in memory of a Japanese man, married to a local Nepali, who was a donor for the reconstruction works."

He is a two-time Olympian (1996 and 2000) and a top 16 finalist in the 200 m breaststroke on his Olympic debut in Atlanta (1996). He still holds a Latvian record in the 200 m breaststroke (2:16.21) that stood for more than a decade. While studying in the United States, Kalmikovs achieved a sixth-fastest of all time in the 200-yard breaststroke at the 2000 NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships. He has also been named a three-time Big-12 Conference Champion and a nine-time All-American, as a member of the University of Nebraska swimming and diving team. Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Kalmikovs has extensively traveled across the United States and Europe, working as a swimming coach."
"Kalmikovs, a native of Riga, Latvia, started swimming at the very young age under a Soviet system. Both of his parents were swimming coaches that motivated and inspired him to undergo training to an elite level and to become part of the Latvian squad. He has one younger sister, Margarita Kalmikova, who is also an elite breaststroke swimmer. Kalmikovs and his sister shared a sibling tandem in the sport, when they both competed together in two editions of the Olympic Games (1996 and 2000)."
"Kalmikovs accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska, where he competed for the Nebraska Cornhuskers swimming and diving team under head coach Cal Bentz. While swimming for the Cornhuskers, Kalmikovs received a total of nine All-American honors, captured three Big 12 Conference titles, and held four school records in the 100 and 200-yard breaststroke.

"At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Kalmikovs decided to drop half of his medley double, and experiment instead with 100 m breaststroke. He achieved FINA B-standards of 1:04.89 (100 m breaststroke), 2:16.30 (200 m breaststroke), and 2:04.83 (200 m individual medley) from the European Championships in Helsinki. On the first day of the Games, Kalmikovs placed thirty-fourth in the 100 m breaststroke. Swimming in heat four, he enjoyed a sprint finish with Puerto Rico's Arsenio López, as they both hit the wall first in a matching time of 1:04.02. Three days later, in the 200 m breaststroke, Kalmikovs established a new Latvian record of 2:16.21 to pull off a nineteenth-place effort from the heats, but missed the semifinal cut by more than half a second (0.50). In his final event, 200 m individual medley, Kalmikovs placed twenty-fourth on the morning prelims. Swimming again in heat four, he came up short in second place by 0.11 of a second behind New Zealand's Dean Kent in a lifetime best of 2:04.18."
"At the 2001 FINA World Championships in Fukuoka, Japan, Kalmikovs competed only in a breaststroke double. He failed to produce best results for the semifinals in any of his individual events, finishing thirty-fifth in the 100 m breaststroke (1:05.36), and twenty-first in the 200 m breaststroke (2:19.23)."
"Kalmikovs also sought his bid for his third Olympics in Athens, but forced to drop out from the Games, because of a wrist injury. Shortly after his qualifying bid, he announced his retirement from swimming."
"Since he graduated from the University of Nebraska in 2001, Kalmikovs continued to serve as an assistant swimming coach. He completed his master's degree in sports management and athletic administration at Valparaiso University in 2003, and later moved to California to coach numerous age group swimmers for Bakersfield Swim Club. He was awarded the 2004 Central California Coach of the Year after a few of his swimmers won USA Junior National Championships."
"Since his sporting career ended in 2004, Kalmikovs has extensively traveled across the United States and Europe, working as a swimming coach. He is married to Australian swimmer Joy Symons, and currently resided together in Rockhampton, Queensland, along with their two children Jett and Cooper."

The community is a short drive to the Fallowfield railway station served by Via Rail. This can be reached also on foot or by bicycle using the Greenbelt Pathway.
"There are no schools or churches within the boundaries of Country Place, although St. Monica's Church is just across Merivale Road. The closest School is St. Monica's School, which is within walking distance and is part of the Ottawa Catholic School Board. Other schools attended by children of Country Place include Meadowlands Public School, Sir Winston Churchill Public School, Merivale High School and St Pius X High School."
On Merivale Road there is a small plaza containing several businesses.
"The community is 1.5 km south of the Nepean South Business Park, which contains a major oil terminal, and numerous other industrial enterprises. It is 3 km south of the Nepean Crossroads retail area where there are many big box stores, including Costco, Canadian Tire and Rona. Additional large retail establishments lie further to the north."
"There are no restaurants in the community currently. Within walking distance on Prince of Wales Drive there is a Tim Horton's, and the Restaurant at the Ramada Hotel. There is also a nearby Chinese restaurant on Merivale Road named after the community, and many other restaurants lie to the north along Merivale Road."
"The closest full-service grocery store is the Metro, located 4 km north along Merivale Road."
There are plans to widen Prince of Wales to four lanes by about 2020.

"The Berwickshire by-election, 1916 was a parliamentary by-election held for the House of Commons constituency of Berwickshire in the Scottish Borders on 18 July 1916."
"Under the provisions of the Succession to the Crown Act of 1707 and a number of subsequent Acts, MPs appointed to certain ministerial and legal offices were at this time required to seek re-election. The by-election in Berwickshire was caused by the appointment of the sitting Liberal MP, Harold “Jack” Tennant as Secretary for Scotland."
"The writ for the by-election was moved in Parliament on 10 July and the returning officer, the Sheriff of Berwickshire, fixed 18 July for the nomination of candidates."
"As the other political parties were collaborating in the wartime coalition government of H H Asquith, the Tories were not expected to oppose Tennant and there was not, as yet, any tradition of Labour contesting Berwickshire. In the absence of any other candidate, Tennant was duly returned unopposed on 18 July and, introduced by the Prime Minister and Eugene Wason MP, re-took his seat in the House of Commons on 20 July to cheers as Secretary for Scotland."
= = = National Rural Livelihood Mission = = =
"National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is a poverty alleviation project implemented by Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India. This scheme is focused on promoting self-employment and organization of rural poor. The basic idea behind this programme is to organize the poor into SHG (Self Help Groups) groups and make them capable for self-employment. In 1999 after restructuring Integrated Rural Development Programme(IRDP), Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) launched Swarnajayanti Grameen Swarojgar Yojana (SGSY) to focus on promoting self-employment among rural poor. SGSY is now remodeled to form NRLM thereby plugging the shortfalls of SGSY programme. This scheme was launched in 2011 with a budget of $5.1 billion and is one of the flagship programmes of Ministry of Rural Development. This is one of the world's largest initiatives to improve the livelihood of poor. This programme is supported by the World Bank with a credit of $1 Billion. The scheme was succeeded by Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana on 25 September 2015."
The basic idea behind this scheme was to form SHG groups and help them to start some entrepreneurial activities but later SHG group failed.
"The core belief of National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM) is that the poor have innate capabilities and a strong desire to come out of poverty. They are entrepreneurial, an essential coping mechanism to survive under conditions of poverty. The challenge is to unleash their capabilities to generate meaningful livelihoods and enable them to come out of poverty."
"""To reduce poverty by enabling the poor households to access gainful self- employment and skilled wage employment opportunities resulting in appreciable improvement in their livelihoods on a sustainable basis, through building strong and sustainable grassroots institutions of the poor."""
The core values which guide all the activities under NRLM are as follows:
"In order to build, support and sustain livelihood of the poor, NRLM will harness their capability and complement them with capacities (information, knowledge, skill, tools, finance and collectivization), so that the poor can deal with the external world. NRLM works on three pillars – enhancing and expanding existing livelihoods options of the poor; building skills for the job market outside; and nurturing self-employed and entrepreneurs."

"In 1999, Win 107.2 (later 107.2 Win FM) was launched as a new local station serving the Winchester and Eastleigh area. Owned by Radio Investments Ltd, the station broadcast from a studio at the Brooks Shopping Centre in Winchester town centre. RIL was later bought by The Local Radio Company."
"TLRC sold Win FM to the Tindle Radio Group in September 2006, and the new owner rebranded the station as Dream 107.2 in October 2007, adopting a soft adult contemporary music policy."
"With extensive competition in the South Hampshire marketplace from numerous regional rivals - including Ocean (now Heart), Wave 105 and Original 106 (now 106 Sam FM) - Dream 107.2 struggled to build an audience, and Tindle Group subsequently decided the station was not viable as a business and should be sold off."
"In November 2008, Tindle Radio Group sold Dream 107.2 to Town & Country Broadcasting, who sought and received permission to largely absorb the Winchester service into their existing Radio Hampshire service at Southampton. The Winchester studios were closed and the 107.2 FM Winchester frequency switched to sharing content with Southampton's service 20 hours a day. A separate local daily breakfast programme for the Winchester licence area was maintained, though this was broadcast from the Southampton base."
"""See also Radio Victory"""
The local FM service for Portsmouth went on air on 19 September 1999 as a revived version of Radio Victory; this was acquired soon after launch by The Local Radio Company (TLRC) and later relaunched as 107.4 The Quay (also known as Quay Radio). The Quay broadcast from studios on Twyford Avenue in Portsmouth.
"Portsmouth F.C. subsequently entered into a joint-venture with TLRC to run the station (along with Spirit FM in Chichester and Isle of Wight Radio), with the club taking full control of The Quay when the partnership was dissolved in August 2009 (TLRC retained Spirit FM) and renaming the station Quay Radio."
"In the summer of 2010, Portsmouth F.C. went into administration; Quay Radio was shut down at noon on Friday 30 July 2010 as a result. The station was sold to Celador Radio Broadcasting, who announced that following their purchase of the frequency, 107.4 FM would broadcast as part of The Breeze 107 from the end of July 2010."
"The broadcast rights to Portsmouth F.C.'s matches remained with the club, meaning that the club's matches would no longer be broadcast on 107.4 FM. It was agreed days before the start of the 2010–11 Championship season that Express FM, a community station for Portsmouth, would now broadcast the commentary for Portsmouth F.C. matches."
"""See also Delta FM"""
"The original Delta Radio first broadcast in January 1990. It was the brainchild of County Sound CEO, Mike Powell who successfully lobbied the IBA for permission to put separate programming for the Haslemere district on what was originally intended to be a relay transmitter for Guildford's County Sound. The station was launched by County Sound's Terry Mann, formerly Programme Director of Radio 210, Reading."
"After County Sound merged with Radio Mercury to form Allied Radio, Delta Radio was closed down by its new owners in 1992 and the transmitter went back to being a relay. However, when Mike Powell's UKRD Group won the Guildford licence (after it came up for renewal), Delta Radio was relaunched in 1996. Wey Valley Radio had already been operating as a full-time service in nearby Alton and Four Marks since 1992. This station was launched as a ""community"" station by David Way and Paul Mann after years of campaigning for such a licence. David Way and Paul Wisdom are the new Wey Valley Radio licence holders today. It was acquired by UKRD in 1994."
"The decision to merge the two stations operationally was made in 1998 and the Wey Valley service was renamed Delta, and then in 2000, the Haslemere licence (which had previously been a part of the Surrey and North East Hampshire franchise) was merged with the Alton licence to finally form a single radio station."
"On 28 May 2009, Radio Hampshire ceased broadcasting due to Town & Country Broadcasting deciding to sell the station. On 5 June 2009, the two licences for Radio Hampshire in Southampton and Winchester were acquired by internet station Play Radio UK."
"The new station for Southampton and Winchester, named Play Radio, launched on the 107.2 and 107.8 FM frequencies at 10am on 4 July 2009. As under Radio Hampshire, the station operated a split breakfast programme (one for Southampton and one for Winchester), with all other programming shared across the two frequencies."
"In April 2010, the licences were purchased by Celador Radio Broadcasting for an undisclosed sum."
"It was announced on 21 June 2010 that the service would be relaunched as The Breeze 107. The new station would be aimed at upmarket 40- to 59-year-olds and broadcast classic and contemporary easy listening music with a slight female bias. It was also announced that the station would relocate, leaving its longtime base at St. Mary's Stadium to share facilities with sister regional station Jack FM in the Kingsway area of Southampton."
"Celador subsequently sought and received permission from Ofcom to end the split breakfast programme, meaning that as of the Breeze relaunch, listeners in Southampton and Winchester were receiving identical programming at all times."
"The Breeze 107 launched on-air to Southampton and Winchester on 4 July 2010, exactly a year after its predecessor Play Radio had officially replaced Radio Hampshire."
"In late July 2010, following Celador's purchase of the Portsmouth licence, the broadcast area of The Breeze expanded."
"In February 2011, Celador relaunched their Bristol station Star 107.2 as The Breeze; following this, programmes broadcast to Bristol (outside of localised daily Breakfast and weekday Drivetime shows) are sourced from the Southampton-based station."
= = = Erta Ale = = =
"Erta Ale (or Ertale or Irta'ale) is a continuously active basaltic shield volcano in the Afar Region of northeastern Ethiopia. It is situated in the Afar Depression, a badland desert area. Erta Ale is the most active volcano in Ethiopia."
"Erta Ale is high, with one or sometimes two active lava lakes at the summit which occasionally overflow on the south side of the volcano. It is notable for holding the longest-existing lava lake, present since the early years of the twentieth century (1906). Volcanoes with lava lakes are very rare: there are only eight in the world."
"""Erta Ale"" means ""smoking mountain"" in the local Afar language and its southernmost pit is known locally as ""the gateway to Hell"". In 2009, it was mapped by a team from the BBC using three-dimensional laser techniques, in order for the mapping team to maintain a distance and avoid the lakes' searingly hot temperatures."
"Erta Ale is centered over the East African Rift system, which is a triple junction setting whose movements are resulting in the formation of a pull-apart basin or rift. The volcano comprises mainly mafic material which has been brought up to the surface caused by unroofing of the mantle due to this rift formation."
"There was a major eruption on 25 September 2005 which killed 250 head of livestock and forced thousands of nearby residents to flee. There was further lava flow in August 2007, forcing the evacuation of hundreds and leaving two missing. An eruption on 4 November 2008 was reported by scientists at Addis Ababa University. Another eruption was reported in January 2017."
"Not much is known about Erta Ale, and the surrounding terrain is some of the most inhospitable on Earth, making travel difficult and dangerous. The Afar region also experiences intermittent ethnic violence due to unification struggles by the native Afar people. On January 16, 2012, a group of European tourists was attacked at Erta Ale. Five tourists were killed, two taken as hostages and seven others wounded. The Afar Revolutionary Democratic Unity Front (ARDUF) claimed responsibility for the attack and released the two kidnapped tourists in March 2012. One travel guide recommends hiring ""one or maybe two armed guards or police"" as guides to visit Erta Ale. Commercial tour companies offer tours to Erta Ale which are generally accompanied by military escort."
"In December 2017, a German tourist was fatally shot while descending Erta Ale."
"The Udzungwa Mountains are a mountain range in south-central Tanzania. The mountains are mostly within Iringa Region, south of Tanzania's capital Dodoma. The Udzungwa Mountains are part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, and are home to a biodiverse community of flora and fauna with large numbers of endemic species."
"The mountains are home to the Hehe people, and the name Udzungwa comes from the Kihehe word “Wadzungwa"", which means the people who live on mountainsides. Iringa is the largest settlement in the mountains, and the regional headquarters."
"The Undzungwa Mountains cover an area of 16,131.40 km², the largest of the Eastern Arc ranges. The highest peak in the range is Luhombero at . The mountain range extends generally northeast-southwest. The Usangu Plain lies to the northwest, drained by the Great Ruaha River and its tributaries. The Great Ruaha River separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Rubeho Mountains and Uvidunda Mountains to the northeast. The Kilombero River valley lies to the south and southeast. To the southwest the Makambako Gap separates the Udzungwa Mountains from the Kipengere Range."
"Both the Great Ruaha and Kilombero rivers are tributaries of the Rufiji River, which empties into the Indian Ocean. The Lukosi River originates in the central part of the range, and empties eastwards into the Great Ruaha. The Little Ruaha River and its tributaries drain much of the western portion of the range, emptying northwards into the Great Ruaha."
"The Udzungwa Mountains intercept moisture-laden winds from the Indian Ocean, and receive more rainfall than the surrounding lowlands. Most of the rainfall occurs in the November-to-May wet season, although mist and light rain occur at higher elevations during the dry season months. Rainfall is higher on the southern and southeastern slopes facing the Indian Ocean, and lower in the mountains' rain shadow to the north and west. Temperatures are cooler at higher elevations."
"The Udzungwa Mountains, along with the others in the Eastern Arc, are made up of ancient crystalline Precambrian rocks that were uplifted over millions of years along fault lines. The most recent period of uplift started 30 million years ago, but the fault system and uplift process may be far older. Soils derived from these ancient rocks are not as fertile as the younger volcanic soils of mountains to the north and west."
"About thirty million years ago, the area was covered by extensive rainforest. During a cooler and drier period some ten million years ago, the lowland forests were converted to savanna, leaving the mountain ranges as ""islands"" where the tropical forests continued to flourish. The long-term persistence of a humid climate and the isolation of each mountain range has led to a great deal of endemism, and a very diverse flora and fauna. The Udzungwa and other Eastern Arc mountains has extremely high biodiversity with numerous endemic species (more than 25 percent of the vertebrate species). 10 percent of them are protected by the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and the Udzungwa Scarp Nature Forest Reserve."
"The Udzungwa Mountains are covered with lowland rainforest, montane rainforest, miombo woodland, grassland, and heathland. Forests extend from 300 to 2579 meters elevation, and vary in composition and species type with elevation and rainfall. The wetter eastern and southeastern slopes receive more rain from the Indian Ocean and support evergreen forests on the lower slopes; the drier western and northwestern slopes have decidious miombo forests and woodlands at lower elevations and evergreen forests only at higher elevations."
Broad areas of forest on the central plateau have been cleared for agriculture and pasture. An analysis of satellite images taken between 1999 and 2003 found 1353 km² of the mountains were still covered in evergreen forest.
"The mountains are home to many mammals, including Abbott's duiker ""(Cephalophus spadix)"", Kipunji ""(Rungwecebus kipunji)"", and Udzungwa red colobus ""(Cercocebus galeritus)"", and unusual animals such as the grey-faced sengi ""(Rhynchocyon udzungwensis)"". The Udzungwa forest partridge (""Xenoperdix udzungwensis"") is an endemic species, with its closest relatives appearing to be the hill partridges of Asia. Elephants ""(Loxodonta africana)"" are found in the forests along the southern escarpment."
"Although the two mountain groups are ecologically distinct, the Eastern Arc Mountains share many species and plant communities with the Southern Highlands which lie to the southwest across the Makambako Gap. Both are Afromontane regions, home to characteristic montane species and ecologically distinct from the adjacent lowlands. The Southern Highlands' climate is more influenced by Lake Malawi than by the Indian Ocean. Some limited-range montane species, including the Kipunji and Kipengere seedeater ""(Crithagra melanochrous)"", inhabit both the Udzungwa Mountains and the Kipengere Range."
"The Kihansi spray toad ""(Nectophrynoides asperginis)"", which was found only around a waterfall on the Kihansi River, became extinct in the wild in 2009 when an upstream dam altered its habitat. The toads have since been reintroduced after a successful captive breeding program."
"Protected areas include Udzungwa Mountains National Park (2088.69 km²), and Udzungwa Scarp (20,220 ha), Kisinga-Rugaro (14,164 ha) and West Kilombero (c.55,000 ha outside the national park) forest reserves"
"It is possible to visit the Udzungwa Mountains National Park and go hiking and trekking. The park has no roads passable by vehicle and is accessible only by foot. The trekking routes vary, from the short and easy one-hour Sonjo Waterfall hike to the extremely difficult 6 day trek the Lumemo Trail. The most popular route is the Sanje Waterfalls trail, taking about four hours to complete."
"The World Wide Fund for Nature is working with local communities to protect the park and provide conservation and management support, monitoring, research and ecotourism initiatives. The help of the local communities is encouraged by giving them access to resources such as the collection of firewood, harvesting medicinal plants and gathering grass for thatching."
"Tanzania's A104 highway runs from northeast to southwest through the central plateau of the mountains, extending northeastwards to Dodoma and southwestwards to Makambako, Mbeya, and the border with Zambia. The A7 highway meets the A104 at Iringa, and extends eastwards through the mountains to Morogoro and Dar es Salaam."
"The Tazara Railway skirts along the southern escarpment of the Udzungwa Mountains, passing through Kidatu (where it meets the Misuku branch of Tanzania's Central Line at a break of gauge), Katulukilla, Mang’ula, Kiberege, Siginali, Ifakara, Idete, Ruipa, Mbinga, Mngeta, Ikule, Chita, Chisano, Mlimba, Lumumwe, Mpanga, Kitete, Kimbwe, Uchindile, Mgololo, Kiyowela, Kitandililo, and Mahongole."

"USS ""Kaskaskia"" (AO-27) was a ""Cimarron""-class fleet replenishment oiler serving in the United States Navy, named for the Kaskaskia River in Illinois."
"""Kaskaskia"" was launched 29 September 1939 by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph P. Kennedy; acquired by the Navy from Esso Oil Company, 22 October 1940; and commissioned 29 October 1940, Commander U.S. Gregory in command."
"""Kaskaskia"" cleared Boston, Mass19 November 1940 for Pearl Harbor, arriving 3 January 1941. She transported oil between West Coast ports and Pearl Harbor, making six cruises before 7 August, when she made an oil run to Johnston Island. The oiler returned to Mare Island 10 September for overhaul and repairs. In San Francisco when the Japanese made their surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, ""Kaskaskia"" immediately began preparations to join the Service Force in the Pacific."
"Sailing from San Diego 6 January 1942, ""Kaskaskia"" commenced fueling operations en route before arriving Pago Pago 20 January. For the next six months she operated out of Nom-a refueling the ships engaged in the violent struggle to stem the Japanese advance. The oiler arrived Kodiak, Alaska, 3 July with a cargo of oil and fuel to be used in the Aleutian Islands campaign. She returned to Wilmington, California, loaded oil and aviation gasoline and continued oil runs to Alaskan ports until she steamed to Nouméa late in March 1943. ""Kaskaskia"" supplied many ships, increasing the mobility of the fleet during the successful campaigns in the South Pacific."
"""Kaskaskia"" returned to San Pedro 28 July for repairs before resuming her duties at Pearl Harbor 21 September. She transported oil between California and Hawaii until she sailed 25 November to support the Gilbert Islands campaign. Returning to Pearl Harbor 10 December, the oiler resumed her cruises between San Pedro and Hawaii."
"As the Navy pushed relentlessly toward Japan, ""Kaskaskia"" departed Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 to support operations in the Marshall Islands. After the Navy had captured the Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, ""Kaskaskia"" supported carrier task forces during their devastating raids on Truk, the Marianas Islands, and Palau Islands in February and March."
"The oiler continued fueling operations in the Marshall Islands area until she cleared Majuro 6 June to fuel destroyers and destroyer escorts in the invasion of Saipan. Throughout June and July ""Kaskaskia"" remained on hand, assisting the fleet to take Saipee, Guam, and Tinian – important supply areas in the future campaign for the Philippines."
"As the Navy fought toward the Philippines, Admiral Nimitz decided to take the Palau Islands as a staging area for aircraft and ships during the invasion of Leyte. ""Kaskaskia"" departed Manus on 4 September with a task group bound for an assault on Peleliu. She operated in the Palau area until returning Manus 8 October. Her stay was a brief one, however, as she sailed 10 October for Leyte. Prior to the actual landings, she fueled units of the fleet, continuing this vital duty until a beachhead had been established. The oiler returned Ulithi 23 October and made another fueling run to the Philippine area early in November."
"After an overhaul at San Diego December 1944 through February 1945, ""Kaskaskia"" arrived Kwajalein 11 March to service the fleet. The oiler cleared Ulithi 30 March for the fueling area off Okinawa, the last major step before the Japanese homeland itself. Once again the oilers, the unsung heroes of the war, stood by refueling the many ships engaged in the irresistible assault from the sea on Okinawa."
"""Kaskaskia"" was relieved of fueling duties off Okinawa, only to be summoned for another important service. She departed Ulithi 3 July to refuel units of the carrier task forces, launching raids on the Japanese Islands of Honshū and Hokkaidō. When the Japanese surrendered, ""Kaskaskia"" steamed into Tokyo Bay 10 September with ships of the Occupation Forces. She continued refueling operations in Japan, China, and Formosa for an entire year before arriving San Pedro 28 September 1946."
"Between 1947 and 1950 she ferried oil and aviation gasoline from the West Coast to the Far East and naval bases in the mid-Pacific. When North Korean troops invaded South Korea, the United States accepted the challenge and ordered its forces to defend the embattled peninsula. ""Kaskaskia"" cleared San Diego 16 September to operate out of Sasebo. During October she entered the heavily mined waters off Wonsan, fueling ships blockading and bombarding that key port."
"During December she arrived off Hungnam to service ships engaged in evacuation operations in that area. Throughout the harsh winter months, ""Kaskaskia"" continued vital fueling missions between Japan and Korea. During the United Nations counteroffensive in the spring of 1951, she also stood by for fueling operations. The oiler returned to Long Beach, California, 27 August for overhaul and operations along the Pacific Coast."
"She sailed for the second Korean tour January 1952, arriving Sasebo on 22 January to refuel the ships engaged in the Korean War. In addition to services in Korea, she also supplied units in Japan, Okinawa and Formosa before returning Long Beach 31 July. Overhaul and training preceded her third Korean deployment from 27 December to July 1953. On this tour she supported ships engaged in fire support operations. Returning home 17 August, ""Kaskaskia"" underwent overhaul; she then sailed again for the Far East 4 January 1954, operated out of Sasebo and returning San Francisco 12 October. Following coastal operations, the oiler was placed out of commission, in reserve, 8 April 1955."
"""Kaskaskia"" was transferred to MSTS 8 January 1957, and operated in that capacity with a Navy crew until 21 October 1957 when she decommissioned and was turned over to the Maritime Administration 10 December. ""Kaskaskia"" was struck from the Navy List 2 January 1959."
"The Berlin Crisis of 1961 necessitated the reactivation of ships and ""Kaskaskia"" was reinstated 8 September. Following overhaul and alterations she recommissioned at Hoboken, New Jersey, 6 December, Captain John D. Howell in command. After shakedown operations in the Caribbean, the oiler arrived Mayport, Florida, 1 May 1962. Throughout the summer she engaged in exercises off the Florida Coast, and sailed to the Azores to participate in Project Mercury, manned orbital flights. She was in company with during the latter's recovery of Astronaut Walter Schirra 3 October, demonstrating the large role of the Navy in space operations."
"""Kaskaskia"" return to Mayport 22 October and two days later sailed to participate in the Cuban blockade. President John F. Kennedy ordered the blockade when the Soviet Union tried to plant offensive missiles only from the United States. The naval pressure persuaded the Soviet Union to withdraw the missiles, easing the crisis. The oiler returned to operations out of Mayport 21 November."
"She cleared Mayport 5 February 1963, for a six-month Mediterranean cruise to refuel ships of the US 6th Fleet, then resumed refueling exercises off Florida for the rest of the year. During 1964 ""Kaskaskia"" engaged in fueling operations and exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean, constantly seeking improved methods to increase the mobility of the Fleet."
"On 6 January 1965, ""Kaskaskia"" sailed for another 6th Fleet deployment. While she was operating in the Mediterranean, her crew worked day and night delivering over 19,000,000 gallons of fuel to 169 ships. ""Kaskaskia"" returned to Mayport, 7 June 1965. She operated primarily along the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean into 1967. Highlights of this period were service to ships patrolling off the coast of riot-torn Santo Domingo in the summer of 1965, and participation in the recovery team for an unmanned Apollo Program space flight in February 1966."
"""Kaskaskia"" was decommissioned for the final time in December 1969 and sold for scrap in September 1970."
"""Kaskaskia"", received nine battle stars for World War II and seven stars for Korean War service."
"Lavender was still in private practice when Governor Henry Bellmon appointed him to fill a vacancy on the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1965, representing District No. 1. The vacancy was caused by the impeachment of Justice N. B. Johnson. The next year, he was elected to hold that same seat for a full six-year term, ending in 1972, and he was subsequently reelected in 1972, 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2002.

"Lavender married Maxine Knight on December 22, 1945. The couple had met while both were attending Catoosa High School. Lavender's wife worked as a child development specialist and, after her retirement, as a consultant for blind and visually-impaired students in nearby school districts. They were married until her death on March 5, 2010."
= = = Kirana gharana = = =
"Kirana gharana is one of the most prolific Indian classical khyal gharanas, and is concerned foremost with perfect intonation of notes (swara)."
"The central concern of the Kirana style is swara, or individual notes, in particular precise tuning and expression of notes. In the Kirana Gayaki (singing style), the individual notes (swaras) of the raga are considered not just random points in the scale but independent realms of music capable of horizontal expansion. Highly emotional ""pukars"" in the higher octaves form a part of the musical experience. Another unique feature of this gharana is the highly intricate and ornate use of the ""sargam taan"" (weaving patterns with the notations themselves) introduced by Abdul Karim Khan under influence from the Carnatic classical style."
In the late nineteenth century Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan revolutionized the khayal gayaki by introducing the vilambit (a slow tempo section) to delineate the structure of the raga note by note.
"Frequently performed ragas by musicians of the gharana include Todi, Lalit, Multani, Patdeep, Puriya, Marwa, Shuddha Kalyan, Darbari Kanhara, and Komal-Rishabh Asavari. Noted Marathi thespian PuLa Deshpande has pointed out that performers from the Kirana gharana are particularly fond of the Komal Re/Rishabh (or minor second in the western system) note of the classical music scale, a frequent feature of these commonly performed ragas."
"In the 19th-century the Kirana gharana coalesced around Miyan Bande Ali Khan, a player of the rudra veena. The gharana's style was further developed, and established as one of the prominent styles in modern Indian classical music in the late 19th / early 20th centuries by the musicians Abdul Karim Khan and Abdul Wahid Khan. Abdul Karim Khan was an extremely popular musician, and was thus highly influential in popularizing the gharana. Some trace the gharana's roots back farther to the 13th-century musician Gopal Nayak, a Hindu musician (of the dhrupad style) who later converted to Islamic Sufism and in the process assimilated the predominantly Muslim khyal musical style."
"The name of this school of music derives from Kirana or Kairana, a town and tehsil of Shamli District in Uttar Pradesh. It is the birthplace of Abdul Karim Khan (1872–1937), who was one of the most important musicians of this gharana and of Hindustani music in general in the twentieth century. A frequent visitor to the Court of Mysore, Abdul Karim Khan was also influenced by Carnatic music, and roots of the tradition can also be traced back to his great-grandfather Ghulam Ali and Ghulam Maula, the brother of Ghulam Ali."
"Owing to the popularity of Abdul Karim Khan, most contemporary Hindustani musicians from Karnataka are exponents of Kirana gharana, and Kirana gharana in turn has absorbed many of the features of the Carnatic tradition. The culturally rich border region between Karnataka and Maharashtra is particularly well known for its association with the gharana."
"The other primary master of the gharana, in the early 20th century, was Abdul Karim Khan's cousin Abdul Wahid Khan who chose to settle at Lahore, Pakistan after the 1947 Partition of British India."
= = = James Robinson Graves = = =
"James Robinson Graves (April 10, 1820 – June 26, 1893) was an American Baptist preacher, publisher, evangelist, debater, author, and editor. He is most noted as the original founder of what is now the Southwestern family of companies. Graves was born in Chester, Vermont, the son of Z. C. Graves, and died in Memphis, Tennessee. His remains are interred in Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis."
"In 1855, Graves established Southwestern Publishing House in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Southwestern originally published ""The Tennessee Baptist"", a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¢ and 30¢ each."
"Prior to the Civil War, most Bibles were printed in the North, rather than the Confederacy. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing Bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867."
"In 1868, Graves discontinued the company’s mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell Bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871."
"Though raised in a Congregationalist family, Graves joined a Baptist church at age 15. Contemporary fellow ministers in the Southern Baptist Convention praised his preaching abilities. Thomas Treadwell Eaton wrote, ""We have seen him hold a congregation packed uncomfortably, for three hours and a half without any sign of weariness on their part. This was not done once or twice, but scores of times."" Denominational leader James Bruton Gambrell described one of Graves' sermons at a small church in Mississippi as ""The Greatest Sermon I Ever Heard."" Scholars have recognized Graves as an early and chief promulgator of the Landmark movement. The subject's Nashville publishing house, Graves, Marks, & Co, which later became South-Western Publishing, published all of fellow 'Landmarker' Amos Cooper Dayton's books. Both were expelled as 'schismatics' between 1858 and 1859 from the Nashville First Baptist Church due to their theological perspectives on their apostolic connection."

= = = Half-pass = = =
"The half-pass is a lateral movement seen in dressage, in which the horse moves forward and sideways at the same time. Unlike the easier leg-yield, the horse is bent in the direction of travel, slightly around the rider's inside leg. The outside hind and forelegs should cross over the inside legs, with the horse's body parallel to the arena wall and his forehand leading. The horse should remain forward, balanced, and bent, moving with cadence. The inside hind leg remains engaged throughout the half-pass, and the horse should not lose its rhythm."
"The half-pass is a variation of haunches-in (travers), executed on a diagonal line instead of along the wall. At higher levels it is used to perform a counter-change of hand, combining more than two half-passes with changes of direction in a zig-zag pattern."

= = = Howard Gordon = = =
"Howard Gordon (born March 31, 1961) is an American television writer and producer."
"He is well known for his work on the Fox action series ""24"" alongside the Showtime thriller ""Homeland"", which he co-developed with Alex Gansa and Gideon Raff, and for the FX political drama ""Tyrant"", which he co-developed with Craig Wright. He also produced the NBC science fiction thriller ""Awake""."
"Gordon was born to a Reform Jewish family in Queens, New York City and graduated from Roslyn High School. After graduating from Princeton with a major in creative writing in 1984, Gordon came to Los Angeles with fellow filmmaker Alex Gansa to pursue a career in writing for television. Both broke into the industry with single episodes of ABC's """". Their ""Spenser"" work turned industry heads, and the pair joined the series ""Beauty and the Beast"" as staff writers, and were later named producers."
"In 1990, the Gansa-Gordon team was signed to a two-year deal with Witt-Thomas Productions, during which they produced several pilots. One was an ABC project called ""Country Estates"", which caught the attention of producer Chris Carter."
"Soon after, Carter invited Gordon and Gansa to join ""The X-Files"" as supervising producers; Gordon wrote or co-wrote several scripts each season, before departing from the series in 1997 to pursue other projects."
"After co-writing one episode of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", Gordon created his own show, the short-lived ""Strange World"" in 1999. ""Strange World"" went to seed 13 episodes in, but Gordon and ""Strange World"" writer Tim Minear's services were quickly snapped up by ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon on another project: ""Angel"". After two years with ""Angel"", Gordon jumped ship in 2001 for FOX's successful ""24"", where he would write several episodes in Seasons 1 & 2, then crafted the entire story arcs for Seasons 3 and 4. Gordon temporarily left ""24"" in the middle of the 2004 season to re-join Minear, this time as co-creator of another FOX series, ""The Inside"". Despite ""The Inside"" 's cancellation and short run, talk circulated of including the two Minear-Gordon series, ""Strange World"" and ""The Inside"", on a special DVD set sometime in 2006."
"Beginning in 2006, Gordon became ""24""'s showrunner, a title he held through its final season."
Gordon is also the author of the Gideon Davis novels.
"In 2010, after finishing ""24"", Gordon began co-developing (along with Gideon Raff and Alex Gansa) the thriller ""Homeland"" for Showtime. Based on the Israeli series ""Prisoners of War"", it centers on a woman (Claire Danes) who works for the CIA and is convinced a recently returned American prisoner of war (Damian Lewis) has been turned by al-Qaeda. The show premiered Sunday, October 2, 2011, at 10/9 central. It has been met with major critical acclaim and maintained a steady viewership rating throughout its first season. Showtime premiered its fourth season on October 5, 2014."
"In 2012, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for writing the ""Pilot"" of ""Homeland"" and the series itself won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series."
"In 2011, Gordon signed on to NBC's new Kyle Killen fantasy pilot ""Awake"" as an executive producer. When NBC picked the project up to series status, Gordon added writer and showrunner to his occupational duties on the show. The series only ran from March 1 to May 24, 2012 before it was cancelled."
"Most recently, 2015 would see him working as an executive producer on the horror-drama series ""Second Chance"" for Fox Television Network. The pilot for ""Second Chance"" is based on a script written by Rand Ravich, who also worked as an executive producer on the series."
= = = Klotho (biology) = = =
Klotho is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the KL gene.
"This gene encodes a type-I membrane protein that is related to β-glucuronidases. Reduced production of this protein has been observed in patients with chronic kidney failure (CKF), and this may be one of the factors underlying the degenerative processes (e.g., arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, and skin atrophy) seen in CKF. Also, mutations within this protein have been associated with ageing, bone loss and alcohol consumption. Transgenic mice that overexpress Klotho live longer than wild-type mice."
"Klotho is a transmembrane protein that, in addition to other effects, provides some control over the sensitivity of the organism to insulin and appears to be involved in ageing. Its discovery was documented in 1997 by Makoto Kuro-o ""et al."" The name of the gene comes from Klotho or Clotho, one of the Moirai, or Fates, in Greek mythology."
"The Klotho protein is a novel β-glucuronidase (EC number 3.2.1.31) capable of hydrolyzing steroid β-glucuronides. Genetic variants in ""KLOTHO"" have been associated with human aging, and Klotho protein has been shown to be a circulating factor detectable in serum that declines with age."
"The binding of certain fibroblast growth factors (FGF's) viz., FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23, to their fibroblast growth factor receptors, is promoted via their interactions as co-receptors with β-Klotho."
"Klotho-deficient mice manifest a syndrome resembling accelerated human aging and display extensive and accelerated arteriosclerosis. Additionally, they exhibit impaired endothelium dependent vasodilation and impaired angiogenesis, suggesting that Klotho protein may protect the cardiovascular system through endothelium-derived NO production."
"Although the vast majority of research has been based on lack of Klotho, it was demonstrated that an overexpression of Klotho in mice might extend their average life span between 19% and 31% compared to normal mice. In addition, variations in the Klotho gene (SNP Rs9536314) are associated with both life extension and increased cognition in human populations."
"The mechanism of action of klotho is not fully understood, but it changes cellular calcium homeostasis, by both increasing the expression and activity of TRPV5 and decreasing that of TRPC6. Additionally, klotho increases membrane expression of the inward rectifier channel ROMK. Klotho-deficient mice show increased production of vitamin D, and altered mineral-ion homeostasis is suggested to be a cause of premature aging‑like phenotypes, because the lowering of vitamin D activity by dietary restriction reverses the premature aging‑like phenotypes and prolongs survival in these mutants. These results suggest that aging‑like phenotypes were due to klotho-associated vitamin D metabolic abnormalities (hypervitaminosis)."
"Recently it has been found that the decreased Klotho expression may be due to DNA hypermethylation, which may have been induced by the overexpression of DNMT3a. Klotho may be a reliable gene for early detection of methylation changes in oral tissues, and can be used as a target for therapeutic modification in oral cancer during the early stages."

= = = Cohoes Falls = = =
"Cohoes Falls [Kahon:ios, Mohawk for ""Canoe Falls""] is a waterfall on the Mohawk River shared by the city of Cohoes and the town of Waterford, New York, United States. Discovered by the indigenous people, the falls were called ""Ga-ha-oose"" or ""Ga-ho'n'-yoos"" by the Mohawks, which is believed to mean ""The Place of the Falling Canoe."" Cohoes historian Arthur Masten wrote in his 1880 history that the phrase might mean ""Potholes in the River,"" referring to the potholes that appear in the riverbed when it is dry. In the oral tradition of the ""Haudenosaunee"" (Iroquois), the Cohoes Falls are the site where The Great Peacemaker, performed a feat of supernatural strength, convincing the Mohawk people to become the founders of the Iroquois League of Nations or Confederacy. Some historians believe the Mohawks launched the Confederacy as early as 1142 CE, though other experts report dates ranging from 1450-1650."
"Celebrated by 18th-century travelers in letters and journals, the Cohoes Falls, also called The Great Falls of the Mohawk, were regarded as the second-most beautiful cataract in New York State after Niagara. In 1804, the national poet of Ireland, Thomas Moore, visited Cohoes and wrote a paean to the waterfall's beauty: ""Lines Written at the Cohos, or Falls of the Mohawk River."""
"In 1831, town leaders built a dam across the Mohawk River to harness the power of the falls to fuel the turbines of the city's burgeoning textile industry. Over the next several decades, the predominant company, Harmony Mills, became the largest manufacturer of cotton in the United States, thanks to its control of local water rights. When all the mills closed in the wake of the Great Depression, city leaders neglected the potential of the falls for tourism. They leased the flow rights to a series of power companies, including Niagara Mohawk and Orion Power."
"The Erie Canal was planned to overcome the navigational barrier of the Cohoes Falls. The original ""Clinton's Ditch"", the Erie Canal of 1825, was built through the city of Cohoes. The later Enlarged Canal was realigned, yet still went through the City of Cohoes. The Barge Canal, which opened in 1918, bypasses Cohoes and runs though the Village of Waterford via the Waterford Flight of Locks."
"The Cohoes Falls is 90 feet (28 m) high and 1,000 feet (305 m) wide. Its flow is most impressive in springtime, sometimes running at of water per second, but as the season changes, there is less water for the falls because so much of the flow is diverted at the Crescent Dam to the Barge Canal through Lock 6. Most of the water is still diverted for power generation; some is diverted for the Cohoes water supply. During the summer, the falls are virtually dry, revealing shale rock formations that have their own distinctive beauty. The 87-year average flow of the Mohawk River at Cohoes is 34,638 cubic feet per second, but this includes water diverted to the power plant and Erie Canal locks."
= = = Usambara Mountains = = =
"The Usambara Mountains of northeastern Tanzania in tropical East Africa, comprise the easternmost ranges of the Eastern Arc Mountains. The ranges of approximately long and about half that wide, are situated in the Lushoto District of the Tanga Region. They were formed nearly two million years ago by faulting and uplifting, and are composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks. They are split into two sub-ranges; the West Usambaras being higher than the East Usambaras, which are nearer the coast and receive more rainfall."
"The mountains are clad in virgin tropical rainforest which has been isolated for a long period and they are a centre of endemism. Historically they were inhabited by Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people but in the eighteenth century, a Shambaa kingdom was founded by Mbegha. The kingdom eventually fell apart after a succession struggle in 1862. German colonists settled in the area which was to become German East Africa, and after World War I it became part of the British mandated territory of Tanganyika."
"The Usambaras are approximately long and ranging from in width. They form part of the Eastern Arc Mountains, which stretch from Kenya through Tanzania. The range is one of the world's Biodiversity hotspots."
"The range is accessible from the towns of Lushoto in the west, and Amani in the east. The Usambaras are commonly split into two sub-ranges, the West Usambara Mountains and the East Usambara Mountains. The East Usambara are closer to the coast, receive more rainfall, and are significantly smaller than the West Usambara."
"The mountain range was formed nearly two million years ago. Due to a lack of glaciations and a relatively consistent climate, the rainforest has gone through a long term and unique evolution resulting in an impressive amount of endemism and an old growth cloud rainforests."
"The West and East Usambaras are large ranges of Precambrian metamorphic geologic formations of acid-gneisses, pyroxenes, and amphiboles. These mountains were formed by faulting and uplifting creating the drainage system of troughs that form many watersheds, which provide water to a majority of the population of northeast Tanzania."
"The Usambara Mountains are fairly unusual in East Africa with their natural regions still covered in tropical forests, which otherwise continentally remain primarily in Western Africa. Considered tremendously significant ecologically and a Biodiversity hotspot. There are many protected zones throughout the range, which are being expanded and contributed to by the Tanzanian government, associated NGO's and research teams, and donor countries such as Norway."
"Several species are endemic to the Usambara forests, including the Usambara eagle-owl (""Bubo vosseleri""), the Usambara akalat (""Sheppardia montana""), the Usambara weaver (""Ploceus nicolli""), the African violet (""Saintpaulia ionantha""), the tree species ""Calodendrum eickii""."
"Historically the Usambara Mountains have been inhabited by the Bantu, Shambaa, and Maasai people who were a mix of agriculturalists and pastoralists."
"A Shambaa kingdom based on Vugu was founded by Mbegha in the first half of the 18th century. His grandson Kinyashi Muanga Ike gave the kingdom a stronger political and military structure. Under Kinyashi's son Kimweri ye Nyumbai the kingdom grew to cover both the west and east Usambaras, extending down to the coast and into the Pangani River valley to the south. After Kimweri died in 1862 the kingdom fell apart in a succession struggle."
"In the late 19th century when within the Usambara District of German East Africa, German colonialists came into the area bringing with them a mix of cash crops like lumber trees, coffee, tea, and quinine, and also designated forests as reserves for either water conservation or timber use. They also brought many new Western concepts, which often were diametrically opposed to traditional beliefs, such as coexistence with the forest versus forest as a ""separate wilderness"". The result of colonialism was a massive change in the way forests were perceived in the community, and conversion of traditional agriculture to cultivating cash crops such as quinine, pine trees, bananas, maize, tea, and coffee."
"In 1882 Adalbert Emil Walter Redliffe le Tanneux von St. Paul-Ilaire (known as Baron Walter), the Governor of the Usambara District of German East Africa, collected seed and plants of a small herb which were sent to Hermann Wendland, Director of the Berlin Royal Botanic Garden. Wendland cultivated the plants and recognized them as representing a new species in a new genus, ""Saintpaulia ionantha"", with the English common name African violet. In the generic name. Saintpaulia he recognized von St. Paul-Ilaire; the specific name he assigned means violet (Gr. ion) flower (Gr. anthos). In their native Usambara Mountains cloudforests, the plants are threatened with extinction."
"In April 2012, the company ran an ad campaign based on the premise that Mike and Ike were ""breaking up"" due to ""creative differences""; the packaging showed one or the other name scratched out. The campaign was intended to capture the interest of younger consumers. In 2013 the company announced Mike and Ike would reunite. In addition to a re-designed packaging and juicier tasting candy, a trailer for a movie was released, entitled, ""The Return of Mike and Ike."""

"Maryland Route 175 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. The highway runs from Little Patuxent Parkway in Columbia east to MD 3 in Millersville. MD 175 is a major highway through the large unincorporated community of Columbia; the highway connects U.S. Route 29 (US 29) next to Columbia Town Center with Interstate 95 (I-95) and an industrial area on the eastern side of Howard County. MD 175 also connects Fort Meade with Jessup and Odenton in western Anne Arundel County, where it links MD 295 and MD 32 with the eastern part of the U.S. Army base."
"MD 175 was constructed from Ellicott City to Millersville in the late 1920s and early 1930s as part of three routes: MD 531 from MD 103 near Ellicott City to US 1 near Jessup, MD 175 from there to Fort Meade and north to Hanover, and MD 180 from Odenton to Millersville. The highway did not originally extend through Fort Meade; MD 175 was constructed through the military installation in the early 1940s as part of major upgrades to the highway from Jessup to Odenton due to its strategic importance. By 1946, MD 175 extended from Ellicott City to Millersville. The highway was widened from Odenton to Millersville in the late 1940s and from Ellicott City to Odenton in the mid-1950s. MD 175 was relocated at I-95 around 1970 and as a major highway through the newly constructed community of Columbia in the mid-1970s. The old portion of the highway from Ellicott City to the new highway became MD 108 and MD 104. There are plans to expand MD 175 to a multi-lane divided highway through Fort Meade due to increased activity at the Army post."
"MD 175 begins just west of its bridges over the Little Patuxent River. The highway continues southwest as Little Patuxent Parkway, the county-maintained six-lane divided highway that forms the main street of Columbia Town Center. MD 175 heads east as Rouse Parkway, a four-lane divided controlled access highway; the highway was renamed from Little Patuxent Parkway to honor Columbia founder James Rouse and his wife Patty in 2006. The highway immediately has a cloverleaf interchange with US 29 (Columbia Pike). MD 175 heads southeast through intersections with Thunder Hill Road, Tamar Drive, and Dobbin Road as it passes between the Columbia villages of Oakland Mills to the southwest and Long Reach to the northeast. The state highway expands to six lanes at Dobbin Road and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Snowden River Parkway that provides access to a park and ride lot serving MTA Maryland commuter buses and a trumpet interchange with Columbia Gateway Drive. Access from eastbound MD 175 to Columbia Gateway Drive requires using the Snowden River Parkway interchange. MD 175 widens to eight lanes at Columbia Gateway Drive, a width the highway carries through its intersection with the eastern end of MD 108 (Waterloo Road) to the highway's partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95. The highway's name changes from Rouse Parkway to Waterloo Road at the MD 108 junction. MD 175 has six lanes from I-95 to east of its junction with US 1 (Washington Boulevard), which was the site of a tavern called Waterloo and before that Spurrier's Tavern."
"MD 175 narrows to a two-lane undivided road as it passes between the Maryland Wholesale Produce Distribution Center to the southwest and the Patuxent Institution on the northeast and enters Jessup. East of Dorsey Run Road, which leads to the Jessup Auto Distribution Center, the state highway crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision and enters Anne Arundel County, where the highway's name changes to Jessup Road. East of the tracks, MD 175 meets the eastern end of unsigned MD 723 (Old Jessup Road), which accesses the Jessup station on MARC's Camden Line, which uses the Capital Subdivision tracks. The highway continues east past the former Maryland House of Correction and has a cloverleaf interchange with MD 295 (Baltimore–Washington Parkway), where the highway's name becomes Annapolis Road. MD 175 temporarily expands to four lanes at its intersection with MD 713, which heads south as Rockenbach Road into Fort Meade and north as Ridge Road toward Hanover. The highway passes through the eastern part of Fort Meade and expands to a four-lane road with a center left-turn lane at Reece Road, which becomes MD 174 on the eastern boundary of the military installation."
"At the southeastern corner of the fort, MD 175 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway) and enters Odenton. The highway crosses over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and meets the southern end of MD 170 (Telegraph Road); the south leg of the intersection, Piney Orchard Parkway, leads to the Odenton station on MARC's Penn Line, which uses the Amtrak tracks. MD 175 continues as a four-lane undivided highway to a five-legged roundabout at the eastern end of Odenton where the highway meets Odenton Road, Higgins Drive, and Sappington Station Road, which is unsigned MD 32AA. The highway continues as a two-lane undivided road past Arundel High School and through the village of Gambrills before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 3 (Robert Crain Highway) west of Millersville. MD 175 has separate intersections with southbound and northbound MD 3; Millersville Road continues east from the northbound intersection through the eponymous village and past the historic Childs Residence."
MD 175 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal freight transport connector from I-95 to Dorsey Run Road in Jessup and as a principal arterial from US 29 to I-95 through Columbia.
"The first section of MD 175 was constructed between 1924 and 1926 as a macadam road from US 1 southeast to the entrance of the Maryland House of Correction east of the B&O Railroad (now CSX) in Jessup. MD 175 was extended as a concrete road east to its modern intersection with MD 713, then northeast along what later became MD 713 to MD 176 in Hanover in 1929. The easternmost portion of MD 175, which was originally MD 180, was constructed as a concrete road starting in 1930 from MD 3 to the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) in Odenton; the highway was complete west to Gambrills by the end of 1930. The original western part of MD 175, from US 1 in Jessup to MD 103 in Ellicott City, was constructed as MD 531 in 1932. The portion of the highway through Fort Meade was a public highway maintained by Anne Arundel County or the federal government through World War II."
"MD 180's crossing of the Pennsylvania Railroad was constructed in 1938. The highway was relocated through Odenton using the new bridge in 1938 and 1939; the old road became MD 677. MD 175's bridge over the B&O Railroad in Jessup was completed in 1942. The highway was widened to a wide road with a concrete base and asphalt surface from Jessup to the MD 713 intersection in 1942. MD 175 was also extended as a road through Fort Meade from MD 713 to west of Odenton between 1942 and 1944. By 1946, MD 175 had been extended east over MD 180 to Millersville and west over MD 531 to Ellicott City; the portion of MD 175 from Fort Meade to MD 176 became MD 713. MD 175 was widened from from Odenton to Millersville starting in 1948. The highway was widened and resurfaced from Odenton to the newly constructed Baltimore–Washington Expressway interchange in 1954. MD 175 was also widened with curve amelioration from US 1 to MD 103 between 1954 and 1956."
"MD 175's first divided highway section was created when the highway was relocated from US 1 to just north of the modern MD 108 intersection in conjunction with the construction of the I-95 interchange in 1969 and 1970. The state highway's interchange with US 29 in Columbia was built in several stages. The westbound and eastbound bridges across the Little Patuxent River were built in 1970 and 1974, respectively. The first parts of the interchange to open were the ramps between county-maintained Little Patuxent Parkway and southbound US 29. MD 175's bridges over US 29 were built in 1974. The interchange fully opened when the new Little Patuxent Parkway was completed from the existing highway at the present MD 108 interchange west to US 29 in 1977.

She has published three books of poetry and is the editor of ""Panikkudam"", a literary quarterly for women's writing and also the first Tamil feminist magazine. Post several literary meetings and reviewing poetry collections by fellow students, she began working on some of her own pieces. Following school, she studied Siddha medicine and got a bachelor's degree in Siddha medicine and surgery, one of the oldest medical systems in the world that derived from her native Tamil Nadu. She had been pursuing her doctoral research in medical anthropology at the Madras Institute of Development Studies in Chennai. Revathi received the Sigaram 15: Faces of Future award for literature from India Today and was awarded a travel grant in 2005 by the Sahitya Akademi to meet leading litterateurs from India. She is a contemporary Tamil poet and has published numerous controversial poetry collections."
"Works by her are noted to be much women-centric. ""Panikkudam"" the first Tamil feminist magazine by her claimed varied aspects such as family, politics, business, discovery of feminine language, introducing modern play, novels, short stories and poetry created by women writers. Interviews of women writers, introduction to modern poetry and short stories, translations of such works into Tamil from World languages, discussions of the creative process and sangam literature were some of the elements that made the part of the magazine. In the field of poetry, her first release in the year 2000 was ""Poonaiyai Pola Alaiyum Velicham"". Kutti Revathi's second book, ""Mulaigal"" that was published in 2002, evoked a storm of protest and stirred controversies from the conservatives of the Tamil literary establishment. The consequences of release were such that a group of outraged male film lyricists damned the book. The debate extended to parameters of cultural debate: obscene calls, letters and threats ensued, and comments on the author's morality were freely aired. While one lyricist demanded that writers of her types must watch out for dire consequences, the other exhorted the public to burn them on Chennai's Mount Road. However she explained, ""My aim is to explore 'Mulaigal' (breasts) as an 'inhabited' living reality, rather than an 'exhibited' commodity."" Adjoint to the content, an essay titled ""With Words I Weave My Body"", she discussed the ways in which a patriarchal tradition, fearful of sharing the power of the written word, compelled women to imprint narratives on their bodies. Her third release was ""Thanimaiyin Aayiram Irakkaigal"" in 2003."

"The slur ""Oaxaquita"" (""Little Oaxacan"") is sometimes used as a derogatory term that is used by Spanish-speaking Mexican-Americans against Indigenous Mexican-Americans. The term carries the connotation that being from Oaxaca is negative and is often used against any Mexican-American who is short or fat. The slur ""indito"" (""little Indian"") is also used against Indigenous Oaxacans. Indigenous Mexican-Americans have been subjected to ridicule, derision, stereotyping, teasing, bullying, and other forms of discrimination and abuse by non-Indigenous Mexican-Americans.

"Walter William Strickland, ""de jure"" 9th Baronet (26 May 1851 – 9 August 1938) was an English translator and radical. He became known as the ""Anarchist Baronet"" because he wandered around the world for much of his life espousing radical causes. After receiving Czechoslovakian citizenship in 1923, he renounced his British citizenship and later moved to Java."
"Strickland was born in Westminster while the family estate was at Hildenley Hall near Malton, North Yorkshire. He was educated at Edinburgh Academy and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the eldest son of Sir Charles Strickland, 8th Baronet (1819–1909), the only child of his first marriage to Georgina, daughter of Sir William Milner, 4th Baronet, but never formally used the title he inherited upon his father's death."
"In 1888, he married Eliza Vokes (1860–1946). A polyglot fluent in ancient and modern languages, he wrote several books and pamphlets and translated works of the Czech poet Vítězslav Hálek, as well as Molière and Horace."
"He has been linked with the Voynich manuscript. He may have met Wilfrid Voynich during his first years in London, when Voynich was directly involved in the political activities of Russian refugees in London, under the leadership of Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky, who founded the SFRF (Society of Friends of Russian Freedom) and the RFPF (Russian Free Press Fund)."
"In the early 1890s, Strickland went to live abroad. In 1911, he sold the family home, which became a convent. After 1912, he did not live in England. Strickland spent some time in Russia and in 1923 became a citizen of Czechoslovakia, formally renouncing his British citizenship and that he would not be using the title.

= = = Modibo Adama = = =
"Adama ɓii Ardo Hassana (1786 – 1847), more commonly known as Modibbo Adama, was a Fulani scholar and holy warrior, who hailed from the Ba'en clan of Fulbe. He led a jihad into the region of Fombina (in modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria), opening the region for Fulani colonisation. As a result of Adama's constant warring, the Fulani today make up the largest ethnic group in Northern Cameroon (at more than 60% of the region's entire population, which considering the fact that they weren't from the area, is a remarkable feat), and Islam is the dominant religion. The wars also forced many peoples south into the forest region."
"Adama studied in Hausaland and earned the title ""Modibbo"" (""Lettered One"") for his scholarship. Upon finishing his studies, he returned home to Gurin and learned of the jihad declared by Fulani mystic Usman dan Fodio. When he accompanied a delegation to visit Usman, the leader ordered Adama to extend his jihad east as ""Lamido Fombina"" (Ruler of the Southlands)."
"Adama raised an army and attacked Bata settlements near Gurin. He took the villages, and many more traditional Fulbe leaders and new soldiers came to his side. He next took on Mandara, the largest and best organised state in the region. He swept over several smaller settlements and eventually conquered the Mandara capital, Dulo, with ease. While his men celebrated, however, the Mandara army counterattacked and recaptured the town."
"Though he fought many more campaigns, Adama now spent most of his time in Yola, which became his capital. He set about creating the administrative structure of his new state, which he named Adamawa after himself. Adama ruled the empire, subordinate only to Usman dan Fodio in Sokoto. Below him lay the heads of major settlements, known as lamibe (singular: lamido). The village formed the smallest unit of government."
"Upon Adama's death in 1847, his son Muhammadu Lawal became Lamido of Adamawa. The empire was not to last, however, as colonial battles and division eventually destroyed the independent Fulani state. The conquest had long-term repercussions, however. The Fulani became the dominant ethnic group in the region, and Islam the major religion. The herdsmen altered the land to be more suitable for herding cattle, their primary pursuit. The jihad also pushed those peoples who had lived on the Adamawa Plateau south into the forest, the single most important event in the populating of Southern Cameroon."
"Adama came from a respected but humble family; his father, Hassana, was a well regarded scholar of Islam and minor nobleman from Ba'ajo. Adama travelled to Bornu for his education, where he stayed for some time under the tutelage of Mallam Kiari. He continued his studies in Hausaland (modern Northern Nigeria), where legend says his teacher was the Fulani Shehu Usman dan Fodio in Degel. Adama proved a bright scholar and a pious Muslim, and he earned the title ""Modibo"", ""Lettered One"". After several years away, he returned home to Guringa around 1804. There, the news was grim. Adama's father had died in 1803 fighting the Bata."
Talk in Gurina also concerned events in Hausaland. Word had arrived that Usman dan Fodio had declared a militant jihad on the Hausa leaders. He had installed himself at Gudu and subsequently defeated non-Fulani leaders at Gobir and Kébbi. Usman had now turned his attention to Bornu and to the vast southlands of Fumbina (modern-day Northern Cameroon).
"Still, the picture seemed unclear to leaders farther from the fighting. Was Usman a ""Mujaddid"" (reformer), or was he the ""Mahdi"", a saviour figure who would create an ideal Muslim society? In 1805 or 1806, the Fulani leaders at Guringa assembled a delegation to visit Usman and find out. Adama's pious reputation and familiarity with Hausaland made him a natural fit for the mission."
"The party met Usman in 1806, probably in Gwandu. There, they learned that his intention was to extend his jihad eastward, into Fumbina. The goal was ostensibly to convert various Kirdi (pagan) peoples to Islam and to protect Muslims who already lived in the area. The jihadists were also supposed to educate the region's current Muslim population, many of whom merged Islam with paganism."
"Though not the oldest member, Adama was one of the more zealous about Usman's ideas. Usman thus presented him with a command that would change his life dramatically. The Shehu gave Adama his blessing and presented him with a flag, the symbol of command in Usman's army. The Shehu then charged Adama to carry the jihad into Fumbina and from the Nile to the Bight of Biafra. Adama also received the power to distribute flags of command to others, thus establishing more centres of Fulani Islam and spreading the war to farther reaches."
"Adama immediately began recruiting Fulani and Hausa volunteers and mercenaries. These were mainly mounted cavalrymen fighting with sword, bow, and poisoned arrow. Adama forbade them to pillage or to kill indiscriminately, but enemy nations were given two choices: convert to Islam or become a tributary state. Those ethnic groups that lacked a centralised government had but one: become slaves to the Fulani and convert to their faith."
"The non-Fulani Muslims of the Adamawa largely rejected Adama's jihad; they viewed it as little more than an excuse to spread Fulani hegemony. However, it was primarily the Fulani leaders (""ardo'en"", singular: ""ardo"") of Fumbina with whom Adama was concerned. Some of them rejected his primacy for various reasons: He was from a fairly humble background, he owned little wealth, his army was still small, and he lacked charisma. The majority, however, welcomed Adama as a military commander or religious leader at the very least. Adama's son-in-law, Jauro Dembo, had already settled in Fumbina at Malabu and became one of his lieutenants."
"The makeshift army made headquarters at Gurin, a fort at the junction of the Faro and Benue Rivers where Fulani warriors had regrouped after fighting the Bata in 1803. Adama then led his forces in a series of strikes on Bata settlements such as Pema, Tepa, and Turuwa. The victories elated Adama's men, who took numerous Bata slaves."
"The early successes convinced more local Fulani leaders to come to Adama's side. Even those ardo'en who opposed his political rule recognised the jihad as an opportunity to expand their territories. Njobdi of the Wollarbe clan is one notable example, and his major rival, Hammam Sambo, perhaps the first ardo to have settled in Fumbina, proved the major holdout. Bitter relations between Njobdi and Hammam would prove a major obstacle in Adama's quest to maintain a cohesive empire."

"In Australia, the 457 visa was the most common visa for Australian or overseas employers to sponsor skilled overseas workers to work temporarily in Australia. It has been abolished since 18 March 2018 by Turnbull government and replaced by another visa category. The full title of this subclass of visa was Temporary Business (Long Stay) and was introduced soon after John Howard became Prime Minister in 1996. The title of the visa was changed to Temporary Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457) visa on 24 November 2012. Applications were processed by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP). On 18 April 2017, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced that the 457 visas will be replaced with two new visa categories."
"Holders of a 457 visa may be employed for a period of up to four years and may bring any eligible family members, including same-sex partners, who have unrestricted work and study rights in Australia. ""If your sponsor is a start-up business or has traded in Australia for less than 12 months, then the visa will be granted for 18 months."" Holders of the subclass 457 visa have no limit on the number of times they travel in and out of Australia."
"Employers must be approved by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection as an approved sponsor. Primary subclass 457 visa holders are restricted to working for their sponsor and may not work (or volunteer) for any other organisation (other than associated entities as defined by the Corporations Act). In order to change employer and sponsor, the ""new employer"" must be or become an approved 457 sponsor and then lodge a 457 nomination. Once the nomination is approved, the employer obligations will shift to the new employer and the visa applicant is restricted to working for it. There is no need to apply for a new 457 visa within the validity of the visa."
"Employees must also meet minimum levels of skill and English language requirements, in addition to character and health requirements. Some trades occupations and passport holders from certain countries may be required to do a skills assessment (see the TRA website)."
It is common for 457 visa holders to apply for a permanent Australia residents visa with a view to permanently settle in Australia and become Australian citizens.
A 457 visa holder can only work in a nominated occupation for the sponsor employer. Medical practitioners and general managers must work in their nominated occupation but they can work for employers other than their sponsor or an associated entity of their sponsor. The specific occupations to which this rule applies are listed in Exemption from the requirement to work directly for the sponsor. The worker must also not have ceased employment for more than 60 consecutive days.
"The Australian Government reviewed the 457 skilled immigrant visa and made some provisions to quicken the transition to permanent residency starting on 1 July 2012. From that date, non-resident workers on the 457 skilled immigration visa are able to transition to permanent residency if they have two years with the employer who has sponsored them and if the employer provides a full-time position in the 457 visa holder's nominated occupation."
"Furthermore, the Australian government has recognised that 457 visas deserve priority in review as they are highly responsive to the needs of the market. Overseas workers will be able to work in Australia on a six-month short term work visa before they apply for a 457 visa."
"As at 30 June 2016, the size of the subclass 457 programme was 94,890 Primary visa holders in Australia."
"An audit by the Fair Work Ombudsman conducted between Sept 2013 and June 2014 found that 40% of 457 visa holders were no longer employed by a sponsor or were being paid well below the statutory minimum wage of $53,900."

"With the commencement of the Japan free trade agreement in 2015, employers no longer need to offer jobs to locals or to prove that none could fill vacancies before Japanese nationals eligible for 457 visas are employed."
"In December 2014, the Department of Immigration and Border Protection released recommendations to relax 457 visa requirements. The recommendations include extending the six month short term work visa to 12 months with no obligation to apply for a 457 visa. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) has criticized this change on the grounds that it avoids the 457 visa's requirement for English language and skills tests and employers would not be required to demonstrate they had first tried to fill job vacancies with Australian workers."

Frisby and McDonough moved the crew's vehicles to a safer location, which they were doing at the time of Granite Mountain crew's entrapment."
"After moving the vehicles, Frisby and other members of the Blue Ridge Hotshots attempted to rescue the entrapped Granite Mountain Hotshots but were forced back by the intense flames and heat of the fire. Driving through the streets of Yarnell, the Blue Ridge Hotshots evacuated several residents who had failed to evacuate earlier. Frisby and his assistant eventually made their way to the entrapment site and were some of the first individuals to find the deployment site and the remains of the Granite Mountain crew."
"According to the National Fire Protection Association, it was the greatest loss of life for firefighters in a wildfire since the 1933 Griffith Park fire, the greatest loss of firefighters in the United States since the September 11 attacks in 2001, and the deadliest wildfire of any kind since the 1991 East Bay Hills fire. The number of total fatalities—although not of firefighters—has since been surpassed by California's 2018 Camp fire which killed 85 civilians."
"On June 30, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer issued a statement offering her condolences. ""This is as dark a day as I can remember,"" she said. She ordered flags flown at half-staff in Arizona through July 19. President Barack Obama issued a statement on July 1, promising federal help and praising the 19 firefighters as heroes."
"Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Craig Fugate and United States Fire Administrator Ernest Mitchell issued similar statements on July 1. On July 2, members of the Arizona Cardinals visited one of the Red Cross shelters, and the team president donated US$100,000 to the 100 Club of Arizona, an organization that assists firefighters, police, and their families in crises. Authorities said that US$800,000 had been raised for the families of the victims as of July 4."
"On July 2, more than 3,000 people attended a public memorial service at an indoor stadium in Prescott Valley. Vice President Joe Biden, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, and the team's lone surviving firefighter, Brendan McDonough, spoke at a memorial in Prescott on Tuesday, July 9. That memorial was attended by thousands, including representatives from over 100 hotshot crews across the country, and was streamed live by several media outlets. Individual memorial services were scheduled for later in the hometowns of the 19 firefighters."
"A nine-member investigative team of forest managers and safety experts arrived in Arizona on July 2. Their mission was to ""understand what happened as completely as possible"" to prevent similar incidents. Granite Mountain Hotshots Memorial State Park was created to honor the hotshots. A path leads from a parking area on Highway 89 up to an observation deck. A trail follows the last steps of the hotshots down to the fatality site where they made their last stand. Encircling the fatality site, 19 gabions, one for each hotshot, are united by chains."
"A second memorial has been placed at the intersection of State Route 89 and Hays Ranch Road in Peeples Valley. On March 3, 2019, the Arizona Hotshots of the Alliance of American Football retired the No. 19 jersey in honor of the nineteen fallen Granite Mountain Hotshots."
"After the fire, the Federal Emergency Management Agency ruled that the fire did not qualify for disaster aid to homeowners because most of the homes that burned were insured. Under federal law, federal disaster relief is not available if there is insurance, and FEMA said: ""damage to uninsured private residences from this was not beyond the response and recovery capabilities of the state (and) local governments and voluntary agencies."" Brewer appealed to President Obama to overturn the decision."
"Following a three-month investigation, the state's Forestry Division released a report and briefing video on September 28, 2013, which found no evidence of negligence nor recklessness in the deaths of the 19 firefighters and revealed that an airtanker carrying flame retardant was directly overhead as the firefighters died. The investigation did find some problems with radio communications due to heavy radio traffic and the fact that some radios were not programmed with appropriate tone guards."
"On December 4, 2013, the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which oversees workplace safety, blamed the state's Forestry Division for the deaths of the 19 firefighters, based on an investigation by the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The Commission said that state fire officials knowingly put protection of property ahead of safety and should have pulled crews out earlier. The commission levied a $559,000 fine."
"Richard Brody, in ""The New Yorker"": ""The Story That 'Only the Brave' Leaves Out"" (October 23, 2017), and Fernanda Santos, in ""The New York Times"": ""Money Splits a City Still Mourning Its Firefighters"" (June 26, 2014) point out numerous cases of firefighters' and their survivors' benefits having been withheld, lawsuits, and acrimony among the local politicians, some citizens, and the survivors of the firefighters who died in the Yarnell Hill Fire that became so extreme that, as Santos observes: ""Juliann Ashcraft decided to leave Prescott altogether to spare her four children the discomfort of whispers and glares."" Brody further points out ""battles that the Hotshots’ widows have faced over health insurance, taxes, labor law, and budgets, involving the online harassment of women""."
"""Outside"" magazine released the documentary film, ""The Granite Mountain Hotshots and the Yarnell Hill Fire"" (August 12, 2013), in which friends, relatives, colleagues, including Brendan McDonough—the lone survivor of the Granite Mountain Hotshots-speak out."

"Until 2001, the Bundesliga was directly under the control German football's governing body the Deutscher Fußball-Bund (DFB or German Football Association). This changed with the formation of the Deutsche Fußball-Liga (DFL or German Football League) when the Bundesligen came under the auspices of this new body. The DFL, while remaining subordinate to the DFB, manages Germany's professional leagues and is responsible for the issuing of licences to clubs, general fiscal oversight of the Bundesligen, and marketing rights for the two upper leagues."
"Since the launch of the Bundesliga on 24 August 1963 fifty-five clubs have played in the league ranks. To help celebrate the 40th anniversary of the league, two clubs with distinguished Bundesliga histories met in a game on 24 August 2003: Hamburger SV, once known as the ""dinosaur"" for being the only club which has played in every season of the league's existence until relegation in 2018, and Bayern Munich, the most successful side in German football, which had just won their seventeenth Bundesliga title."
"In 2005, German football was once again overshadowed by the discovery of a match-fixing scandal involving second division referee Robert Hoyzer, who confessed to fixing and betting on matches in the 2. Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal (German Cup), and the Regionalliga (III). The games included a DFB-Pokal first-round match between regional side Paderborn and Bundesliga heavyweights Hamburg on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost (2–4) through penalties and a red-card charged to the side and was eliminated from the lucrative competition."
"Hoyzer was banned for life and received a 29-month prison sentence. He soon implicated other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers, leading to an ongoing investigation. To this point, at the end of 2005, it appears that the scandal did not directly involve the Bundesliga and was confined to lower divisions:"
"Despite the scandal, the Bundesliga continues to set new attendance records. In the Bundesliga's 43rd season, total attendance was about 12.41 million in 306 games for an average of 40,572 per game, a 6.9% increase over the preceding year, making the 2005–06 season the 5th consecutive record attendance year. After a decrease in 2006–07 and a slight recovery in 2007–08, new records were set in 2008–09, with 12.82 million total attendance and a per-game average of 41,904. The 2008–09 figure makes the Bundesliga the best-attended national football league in the world by per-game attendance. It is also third in per-game attendance among major professional sports leagues in the world, slightly ahead of the Australian Football League (Australian rules) and well behind the second-ranked Indian Premier League (Twenty20 cricket) and top-ranked NFL (American football) in the United States. Top drawing clubs based on average attendance included: Borussia Dortmund 72,850; FC Bayern Munich 67,214; FC Schalke 04 61,177; and Hamburger SV 53,298. Interest in the league was piqued by the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosted in Germany. An ambitious program of stadium upgrades was undertaken in preparation for the tournament."
"The 2. Bundesliga saw an enormous increase in popularity in 2006–07, drawing about 4.67 million spectators for an average of 15,253. This not only smashed the league's previous attendance record, but also marked an increase of more than 20% over the 2005–06 season. The league saw another huge increase in popularity in 2007–08, drawing 5.55 million spectators for an average of 18,140, an increase of almost 19% over the previous season, which briefly made the 2. Bundesliga the most-attended second-level professional sports league in the world on a per-game basis. However, the league would lose almost all of these gains in 2008–09, with total attendance of 4.76 million and an average of 15,550. Although the Second Bundesliga is now second in attendance to England's Football League Championship among second-level professional sports leagues, it still draws more spectators per game than the top leagues in such established footballing nations as Turkey, Russia, and Portugal."
"Starting with the 2008–09 season, a new third-level league, the 3. Liga, was launched, slotting between the 2. Bundesliga and the Regionalliga in the league pyramid. Unlike the Bundesligen, the 3. Liga is operated directly by the DFB. At the same time, the Regionalliga went from two divisions to three."
"One of the problems currently facing the league is in the performance and fate of clubs from the former East Germany, which are finding it difficult to compete with the wealthy, established western sides. One-time GDR clubs are unable to attract lucrative sponsorships, cannot afford the salaries needed to hold on to their ""homegrown"" talent, and find themselves playing in crumbling or primitive stadium facilities. Of the 36 clubs in the top two levels of the league system in the 2011–12 season, five are from the former East Germany, an increase of two from 2010–11. However, as in the previous two seasons, none will be in the First Bundesliga. The five former Eastern clubs in the 2. Bundesliga are Energie Cottbus, who last appeared in the First Bundesliga in 2008–09; Union Berlin, from the former East Berlin, who have been in the 2. Bundesliga since being promoted as champions of the inaugural season of the 3. Liga; Erzgebirge Aue, present since the 2010–11 season; Hansa Rostock, who immediately returned from a one-season stint in the 3. Liga; and Dynamo Dresden, making their first appearance at the second level in five years. Four other eastern clubs are playing in the 2011–12 3. Liga—Carl Zeiss Jena, Chemnitz, Rot-Weiß Erfurt, and the Potsdam club Babelsberg."
"In preparations for the 2006 World Cup, the DFB attempted to fairly balance the number of venues between the eastern and western halves of the country. However, the organization had to face up to the reality of there not being enough suitable facilities in the old DDR –not limited to stadiums, but including hotels, restaurants and other visitor needs, and transportation infrastructure–, with the result that the east finds itself underrepresented. Only one of the 2006 venues was in the former East Germany (in Leipzig). Similarly, only one of the nine venues for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, also held in Germany, was in the former East Germany (in Dresden). The situation fits into the broader context of the effects of German reunification on East Germany and the resentment that many Ossis feel for their western cousins."
"RB Leipzig is one notable club that produced a major resurgence of football in the former East Germany. This club saw several successive promotions in a short period of time and gained promotion to the Bundesliga for the 2016–17 season. The club's success has been controversial. RB Leipzig was founded by initiative of drink company Red Bull GmbH, whose involvement in the club has sparked new discussions about commercialism in professional football."
"The 2012–13 season saw FC Bayern Munich become the first club ever to achieve the treble by winning the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal, and European Cup."
"Bayern Munich made German football history even further by earning a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title in 2016, and eventually became the first German club to attain more than four championships in succession by winning their fifth and sixth titles in 2017 and 2018 respectively for the club's 27th league title and their 28th nationally, both new records."
"Meanwhile, after 55 seasons, Hamburger SV was relegated from the Bundesliga to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time in the club's history. During the 2017–18 season, a final day win over Gladbach was not enough to escape the drop as Wolfsburg won against Cologne. Hamburg had to endure a disastrous season under various managers after surviving two playouts in the preceding four seasons."

"Mona Mahmudnizhad (, September 10, 1965 – June 18, 1983) was an Iranian Baháʼí who, in 1983 (together with nine other Baháʼí women) was sentenced to death and hanged in Shiraz, Iran. She was accused of being a member of the Baháʼí Faith."
"The official charges ranged from ""misleading children and youth"", to being a ""Zionist"" (because the Baháʼí World Centre is located in Israel)."
The non profit Mona Foundation focusing on girl's education was named after her in 2001.
"Mahmudnizhad was born on September 10, 1965, to Yad'u'llah and Farkhundeh Mahmudnizhad (who had left their home in Iran to teach their religion in Yemen)."
"In 1969 the government of Yemen expelled all foreigners and the Mahmudnizhad family returned to Iran. They spent two years in Isfahan, six months in Kermanshah and three years in Tabriz before finally settling in Shiraz in 1974. During this time her father repaired small appliances for work and served the Baháʼí community as part of various Baháʼí administrative bodies."
"While Baháʼís regularly faced persecution in Iran, the Islamic Revolution of 1979 reinforced this further. At 7:30pm on October 23, 1982, four armed Revolutionary Guards, sent by the public prosecutor of Shiraz, entered the Mahmudnizhad household and ransacked the home in search of Baháʼí material. They then took Mona and her father into custody. The two were blindfolded and taken to Seppah prison in Shiraz, where they were placed in separate quarters; Mahmudnizhad was detained in Seppah prison for a total of 38 days."
"On November 29, 1982, she and five other Baháʼí women were transferred from Seppah prison to Adelabad prison (also in Shiraz). After some time in Abelabad, she was transferred to the Islamic Revolutionary Court where she was interrogated and placed back in prison."
"A few days later, she was once again interrogated in front of an Islamic Revolutionary judge. After these series of interrogations, which involved physical torture by being whipped on the soles of her feet with a cable, Mahmudnizhad was found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. At the time of her sentencing, President of the United States Ronald Reagan, made a plea for clemency; despite this, the sentence of the 10 women was carried out on the night of June 18, 1983, at a nearby polo field."
The other women who were hanged with Mahmudnizhad were:
"In September 2007, the Iran Human Rights Documentation Center published a case study on the subject."
"Mahmudnizhad's story is the subject of several art works. Music artist Doug Cameron recreated Mahmudnizhad's story in a music video, ""Mona with the Children"", which made the pop charts in Canada (#14 for the week of October 19, 1985). The video was distributed throughout the music scene and was effective in bringing the persecution of Baháʼís in Iran to international public attention."
"A play based on Mahmudnizhad's story titled ""A Dress for Mona"" has been produced and in 2008 Jack Lenz produced a film called ""Mona's Dream"". Her pictures are also featured in Mithaq Kazimi's Quenching The Light video."

"There are no EVEX-prefixed versions of the blend instructions from SSE4; instead, AVX-512 has a new set of blending instructions using mask registers as selectors. Together with the general compare into mask instructions below, these may be used to implement generic ternary operations or cmov, similar to XOP's VPCMOV."
"Since blending is an integral part of the EVEX encoding, these instruction may also be considered basic move instructions. Using the zeroing blend mode, they can also be used as masking instructions."
"AVX-512F has four new compare instructions. Like their XOP counterparts they use the immediate field to select between 8 different comparisons. Unlike their XOP inspiration, however, they save the result to a mask register and initially only support doubleword and quadword comparisons. The AVX-512BW extension provides the byte and word versions. Note that two mask registers may be specified for the instructions, one to write to and one to declare regular masking."
"The final way to set masks is using Logical Set Mask. These instructions perform either AND or NAND, and then set the destination opmask based on the result values being zero or non-zero. Note that like the comparison instructions, these take two opmask registers, one as destination and one a regular opmask."
"The compress and expand instructions match the APL operations of the same name. They use the opmask in a slightly different way from other AVX-512 instructions. Compress only saves the values marked in the mask, but saves them compacted by skipping and not reserving space for unmarked values. Expand operates in the opposite way, by loading as many values as indicated in the mask and then spreading them to the selected positions."
"A new set of permute instructions have been added for full two input permutations. They all take three arguments, two source registers and one index; the result is output by either overwriting the first source register or the index register. AVX-512BW extends the instructions to also include 16-bit (word) versions, and the AVX-512_VBMI extension defines the byte versions of the instructions."
"Two new instructions added can logically implement all possible bitwise operations between three inputs. They take three registers as input and an 8-bit immediate field. Each bit in the output is generated using a lookup of the three corresponding bits in the inputs to select one of the 8 positions in the 8-bit immediate. Since only 8 combinations are possible using three bits, this allow all possible 3 input bitwise operations to be performed."
"These are the only bitwise vector instructions in AVX-512F; EVEX versions of the two source SSE and AVX bitwise vector instructions AND, ANDN, OR and XOR were added in AVX-512DQ."
The difference in the doubleword and quadword versions is only the application of the opmask.
Truth table:
A number of conversion or move instructions were added; these complete the set of conversion instructions available from SSE2.
"Among the unique new features in AVX-512F are instructions to decompose floating-point values and handle special floating-point values. Since these methods are completely new, they also exist in scalar versions."
"This is the second set of new floating-point methods, which includes new scaling and approximate calculation of reciprocal, and reciprocal of square root. The approximate reciprocal instructions guarantee to have at most a relative error of 2."
The instructions in AVX-512 conflict detection (AVX-512CD) are designed to help efficiently calculate conflict-free subsets of elements in loops that normally could not be safely vectorized.
AVX-512 exponential and reciprocal instructions contain more accurate approximate reciprocal instructions than those in the AVX-512 foundation; relative error is at most 2. They also contain two new exponential functions that have a relative error of at most 2.
AVX-512 prefetch instructions contain new prefetch operations for the new scatter and gather functionality introduced in AVX2 and AVX-512. codice_1 prefetch means prefetching into level 1 cache and codice_2 means prefetching into level 2 cache.
"AVX-512DQ adds new doubleword and quadword instructions. AVX-512BW adds byte and words versions of the same instructions, and adds byte and word version of doubleword/quadword instructions in AVX-512F. A few instructions which get only word forms with AVX-512BW acquire byte forms with the AVX-512_VBMI extension (codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6)."
"Two new instructions were added to the mask instructions set: codice_7 and codice_8 (B and W forms with AVX-512DQ, D and Q with AVX-512BW). The rest of mask instructions, which had only word forms, got byte forms with AVX-512DQ and doubleword/quadword forms with AVX-512BW. codice_9 was extended to codice_10 and codice_11 by AVX-512BW."
"Among the instructions added by AVX-512DQ are several SSE, AVX instruction that didn't get AVX-512 versions with AVX-512F, among those are all the two input bitwise instructions and extract/insert integer instructions."
Instructions that are completely new are covered below.
Three new floating point operations are introduced. Since they are not only new to AVX-512 they have both packed/SIMD and scalar versions.
"The codice_12 instructions tests if the floating point value is one of eight special floating-point values, which of the eight values will trigger a bit in the output mask register is controlled by the immediate field. The codice_13 instructions perform minimum or maximum operations depending on the value of the immediate field, which can also control if the operation is done absolute or not and separately how the sign is handled. The codice_14 instructions operate on a single source, and subtract from that the integer part of the source value plus a number of bits specified in the immediate field of its fraction."
Extend VPCOMPRESS and VPEXPAND with byte and word variants. Shift instructions are new.
Vector Neural Network Instructions.
EVEX-encoded Galois field new instructions:
"VPCLMULQDQ with AVX-512F adds EVEX-encoded 512-bit version of PCLMULQDQ instruction. With AVX-512VL, it adds EVEX-encoded 256- and 128-bit versions. VPCLMULQDQ alone (that is, on non-AVX512 CPUs) adds only VEX-encoded 256-bit version. (Availability of the VEX-encoded 128-bit version is indicated by different CPUID bits: PCLMULQDQ and AVX.) The wider than 128-bit variations of the instruction perform the same operation on each 128-bit portion of input registers, but they do not extend it to select quadwords from different 128-bit fields (the meaning of imm8 operand is the same: either low or high quadword of the 128-bit field is selected)."

= = = Coucher de soleil no. 1 = = =
"Coucher de soleil no. 1 (also called Landscape, Paysage, Landschap, or Sunset No. 1) is an oil painting created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is a work executed in a mosaic-like Divisionist style with a Fauve palette. The reverberating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light at the core of Neo-Impressionist color theory."
"""Coucher de soleil"" was exhibited in Paris during the spring of 1907 at the Salon des Indépendants (n. 3457), along with ""Bacchante"" and four other works by Metzinger."
"The painting had been in the collection of Helene Kröller-Müller since 1921 or prior, now in the collection of the Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands."
"""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" is an oil painting on canvas in a horizontal format with dimensions 72.5 x 100 cm (28.5 by 39.25 in), signed ""J.Metzinger"" (lower right), and titled on the verso ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"". Also on the verso is another painting by Metzinger representing a river scene with ships."
"The work represents two nude women relaxing in a lush Mediterranean landscape with semi-tropical vegetation, hills, trees, a body of water and a radiating setting sun beyond. The plants to the lower left resemble the agave, a species found in the south of France, Spain and Greece. ""Agave"" is also the name of three characters in Greek mythology:"
The two nudes appear to play a secondary role in the overall composition due to their small size. But their prominent location in the foreground and the provocative nature of public nudity propels them to a position that cannot be ignored.
"In this luscious setting—as in ""Luxe, Calme et Volupté"" by Henri Matisse—Metzinger makes use all the colors in the spectrum of visible light. Unlike Matisse's work, Metzinger's brushstrokes are large, forming a mosaic-like lattice of squares or cubes of similar size and shape throughout, juxtaposed in a wide variety of angles relative to one another, creating an overall rhythm that would otherwise not be present."
"Evidence suggests that this work was completed prior to Metzinger's paintings entitled ""La danse (Bacchante)"" or ""Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape"": (1) there exists an oil on canvas study of the latter dated circa 1905-1906, located at the University of Iowa with the title ""Two Nudes in a garden"", 91.4 x 63.8 cm with a similar radiating sun above the bathers. (2) The brushstrokes are smaller in size consistent with Metzinger's style of late 1905. (3) In 1906 and 1907 Metzinger's brushstrokes became larger and more organized, structured within a highly geometrized framework already proto-Cubist in appearance. (4) As its name implies, ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" might have been the first in a series of sunsets. Though no other works by Metzinger are known by the titles ""Coucher de soleil no. 2"" or ""No. 3"", the artist did produce other works with sunsets during the same period: ""Landscape with Fountain"", for example, an oil on canvas measuring 53.3 x 73.6 cm; ""Paysage pointilliste"", 1906-07, an oil on canvas measuring 54.5 x 73 cm; ""Matin au Parc Montsouris"", ca. 1906, oil on canvas, 49.9 x 67.7 cm; or even ""La tour de Batz au coucher de soleil"", 54 x 73 cm, an oil on canvas ca. 1905."
"Indeed, these clues would seem to suggest ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"" was painted during the later months of 1905, or early 1906, just before Metzinger and Robert Delaunay began painting portraits of one another, rather than circa 1908 as indicated by the Kröller-Müller Museum."
"The Fauves (many of whom would become Cubists), were heavily influenced by Neo-Impressionism, calling upon rational and scientific thought and creating highly abstract visions with the goal of producing the effects of real color-light. Mechanical brushwork suppressed the personality of the artist in an act of conspicuous defiance against the Impressionists. The Symbolists too would strip away the casual and accidental features of reality, revealing the true 'essence of form.' Whether such a revelation could be backed up by a scientific theory or not, there were still examples that could be codified. The problem was that pigments ""reflect"" light, they are not a light source themselves. Colors in the spectra of light did not respond in the same way as color pigments painted on canvas. For example, red and blue light rays result in white light, but the same colors in pigments make violet."
"Metzinger's response in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", in addition to illustrating actual radiation emanating in concentric circles from the sun, was to separate colors in such a way as to avoid mixtures, leading to inert tones. Contrary to the Impressionists related hues, often placed on top of one another while still wet—leading to a result the Divisionists found dull—contrasting hues placed side by side for the effect or creating optical vibrations were essential to Divisionists."
"The basic elements of art—the line, particle of color—like words could be treated autonomously, each possessing an abstract value independent of one another, if so chose the artist. The line, independent of its topographical role, possesses an calculable abstract value, in addition to the particles of color and the relation of both to the observer's emotion. The underlying theory behind Neo-Impressionsim, something Divisionists like the Metzinger would push to the extreme, would have a lasting effect on the works produced in the coming years by Albert Gleizes, Robert Delaunay and Gino Severini."
"The impulse toward abstraction was a primary quality of the time, even prior to Metzinger's ""Sunset No. 1"". ""Neo-Impressionism"" wrote Paul Adam, ""wants to reproduce the pure phenomenon, the subjective appearance of things. It is a school of abstraction."""
"By ""abstract,"" writes Robert Herbert, ""writers and painters of the period did not mean ""devoid of reference to the real world"", as we now use the term. They meant to draw away from nature, in the sense of disdaining imitation in order to concentrate upon the distillation of essential shapes and movements. These distilled forms were superior to nature because they partook of ""idea"", and represented the dominance of the artist over the mere stuff of nature. In embryo, the Symbolists and Neo-Impressionists did establish the philosophical defense of pure abstraction, but nature still formed part of the basic dialogue."""
"By 1905 Metzinger began to favor the abstract qualities of larger brushstrokes and luminous colors. Following the lead of Georges Seurat, Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Cézanne, Metzinger began incorporating a new geometry into his works that signified a further departure still from naturalism."
"Robert Herbert writes of Metzinger's ""Coucher de soleil"" and its importance during the Neo-Impressionist period and thereafter:"
"The vibrating image of the sun in Metzinger's painting, and of Delaunay's ""Paysage au disque"" (1906-1907), writes Herbert, ""is an homage to the decomposition of spectral light that lay at the heart of Neo-Impressionist color theory..."""
"""The Neo-Impressionists"" according to Maurice Denis, ""inaugurated a vision, a technique, and esthetic based on the recent discoveries of physics, on a scientific conception of the world and of life."""
"In 1904-05 Henri Poincaré discovered a graphical tool for visualizing different types of polarized light (known as Poincaré sphere). The Poincaré homology sphere, also called Poincaré dodecahedral space, is a particular example of a homology sphere. Being a spherical 3-manifold, it is the only homology 3-sphere, besides the 3-sphere itself, with a finite fundamental group. While it is not known the extent to which such discoveries influenced Metzinger's representation of the radiating sun in ""Coucher de soleil no. 1"", his interest and prowess in mathematics is well documented."

"The Huntsville Fire was an American professional indoor soccer team based in Huntsville, Alabama. The Fire played in the Eastern Indoor Soccer League during both of the league's seasons from 1997 to 1998. They played their home games in the Von Braun Center. The team began the 1997 season as the Florida-based Daytona Beach Speedkings before financial struggles forced a sale early in the season."
"During their existence, the Fire/Speedkings played a combined total of 52 games, winning 29, two via shootout, and losing 23, two via shootout. They scored a total of 810 goals and allowed a total of 702 goals and notched 87 total standings points out of a possible 156 points. The EISL awarded 3 standings points for a win, 2 for a shootout win, 1 for a shootout loss, and 0 for a loss in regulation."
"The team, a charter member of the Eastern Indoor Soccer League, was founded as the Daytona Beach Speedkings. They played their home games at the Ocean Center in Daytona Beach, Florida, under the direction of coach Scott Cooper. The team played the first-ever game in EISL history, losing to the Savannah Rug Ratz in front of a ""disappointing"" crowd of 600 fans. Despite having a winning record (5–3) and the league's top offense, the team failed to draw fans and suffered financially. Before the season, team owner Blake Cullen told the ""Orlando Sentinel"" that the team would need to average about 3,000 fans per game to break even. The team's official home attendance average was 609 per game but the bulk of those were complimentary tickets with the SpeedKings selling fewer than 200 tickets per game."
"This failure prompted Cullen to sell the team to Major League Indoor Football, Inc., based in Clearwater, Florida, who announced the team would relocate to the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, Alabama. In just three weeks the new management headed by team president Bryan Dresden, moved the team from Daytona Beach opening to an inaugural crowd of over 2500 new fans in Huntsville, Alabama. The renamed Huntsville Fire finished the season with a record of 13 wins and 11 losses, including 1 shootout win. This gave the team a total of 38 points for the 1997 season and 4th place in the seven-team league."
"The Fire returned for the 1998 season. They finished the season with a record of 16 wins and 12 losses (including 1 shootout win and two shootout losses) for 49 points. This placed them 3rd overall in the seven-team league. The Fire made the playoffs, losing to the Mississippi Beach Kings 2 games to 1 in the semi-final round. The Fire averaged 2,535 fans per game, fourth-best in the EISL where the average league game saw 2,733 fans in attendance."
"As Pope developed the game, he regularly posted updates to TIGSource, a forum for independent developers, and got helpful feedback on some of the game's direction. He also created a publicly available demonstration of the game, which further had positive feedback to him. Pope opted to try to have the game submitted to the Steam storefront through the user-voted Greenlight process in April 2013; he was hesitant that the niche nature of the game would put off potential voters and had expected that he would gain more interest from upcoming gaming expositions. However, due to attention drawn by several YouTube streamers that played through the demo, ""Papers, Please"" was voted through Greenlight within days."
"With new attention to the project, Pope estimated that the game would now take six months to complete, though it ultimately took nine months. One area he expanded on was to create several unique character names for the various citizens that would pass through the game. He opened up to the public to supply names, but ended up with over 30,000 entries, with more than half he considered unusable as they did not figure the types of Eastern European names he wanted or were otherwise ""joke names"". After the Greenlight process, Pope started to add other features that required the player, as a lowly checkpoint worker, to make significant moral decisions within the game. One such design was the inclusion of the body scanner, where Pope envisioned that the player would recognize this being an invasion of privacy but necessary to detect a suicide bomber. These also helped to drive the game's narrative as to provide rationale for why the player as the passport checker would need to have access to these new tools in response to the larger events in the game's fiction. After being successfully voted on Greenlight, ""Papers, Please"" was being touted as an ""empathy game"", similar to ""Cart Life"" (2011), helping Pope to justify his narrative choices. Pope also recognized that not all players would necessarily appreciate the narrative aspects, and started to develop the ""endless"" mode where players would simply need to process a queue of immigrants limited only by the player making a certain number of mistakes."
"Pope released the game on August 8, 2013 for Windows and OS X systems, and for Linux machines on February 12, 2014."
"Pope had ported the game to the iPad, and was considering a port to the PlayStation Vita though noted that with the handheld, there are several challenges related to the game's user interface that may have to be revamped. The Vita version was formally announced at the 2014 Gamescom convention in August 2014. With the iOS release, Apple required Pope to censor the full body scanner feature from the game, considering the aspect to be pornographic content. However Apple later commented that the rejection was due to a ""misunderstanding"" and allowed Pope to resubmit the uncensored game by including a ""nudity option"". The iPad version was subsequently released on December 12, 2014. The Vita's version was released on December 12, 2017."
"By March 2014, Pope stated that he was ""kind of sick to death"" of ""Papers, Please"", in that he wanted to continue to focus on more smaller games that would only take a few months of time to create and release, and had already spent far too much in his mind on this one. He expected to keep supporting ""Papers, Please"" and its ports, but had no plans to expand the game or release downloadable content, but does not rule out revisiting the Arstotzka setting again in a future game."
"""Papers, Please"" received positive reviews on release, receiving ""generally favorable reviews"" from 40 reviews on Metacritic. ""Papers, Please"" has been praised for the sense of immersion provided by the game mechanics, and the intense emotional reaction. CBC News' Jonathan Ore called ""Papers, Please"" a ""nerve-racking sleuthing game with relentless pacing and dozens of compelling characters – all from a desk job"". Simon Parkin writing for ""The New Yorker"" blog declared ""Papers, Please"" the top video game of 2013. He wrote: ""Grim yet affecting, it’s a game that may change your attitude the next time you’re in line at the airport."" Some critics received the story very well: Ben ""Yahtzee"" Croshaw of The Escapist's series ""Zero Punctuation"" lauded the game for being a truly unique entry for 2013 and even made it one of his top five games for that year; he cited the game's morality as his reasoning by explaining that ""[""Papers, Please""] presents us constant moral choices, but makes it really hard to be a good person... while you could waive the rules to reunite a couple [...] you do it at the expense of your own family... You have to decide if you want to create a better world or just look after you and yours."""
"""Wired"" listed ""Papers, Please"" as their top game for 2013, recognizing that the game's title, often coupled with the Hollywood representation of Nazi officials stopping people and demanding to see their identification, alongside the drab presentation captured the ideas of living as a lowly worker in a police state. In 2019, the game was ranked 45th on ""The Guardian"" newspaper's The 50 Best Video Games of the 21st Century list."
"Some critics reacted against the paperwork gameplay. Stephanie Bendixsen from the ABC's game review show ""Good Game"" found the game ""tedious"", commenting ""while I found the issues that arose from the decisions you are forced to make quite interesting, I was just so bored that I just struggled to go from one day to the next. I was torn between wanting to find out more, and just wanting it all to stop."""
"""Papers, Please"" is considered by several journalists as an example of video games as an art form. ""Papers, Please"" is frequently categorized as an ""empathy game"", a type of role-playing game that ""asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds"", as described by Patrick Begley of the ""Sydney Morning Herald"", or as described by Pope himself, ""other people simulators"". Pope noted that he had not set out to make an empathy game, but the emotional ties created by his scenarios came about naturally from developing the core mechanics."
""""" includes an Easter egg to ""Papers, Please"", when its protagonist Nathan Drake compares a line of people waiting at a passport station to the situation in Arstotzka. A nod to ""Papers, Please"" was briefly shown on the episode ""Playtest"" of the series ""Black Mirror"", where a fictional cover of ""Edge"" includes a cover story regarding ""Papers, Please III""."
"""Papers, Please"" won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, ""Excellence in Narrative"", and ""Excellence in Design"" awards at the 2014 Independent Games Festival Awards and was nominated for the Nuovo Award. The title also won the ""Innovation Award"" and ""Best Downloadable Game"" at the 2014 Game Developers Choice Awards. The game won ""Best Simulation Game"" and was nominated in the categories of ""Best Game"", ""Game Design"", and ""Game Innovation"" at the 2014 BAFTA Video Games Awards."
"As of March 2014, at the time of the BAFTA awards, Pope stated that the game had sold 500,000 copies. By August 2016, three years from release, Pope stated that more than 1.8 million copies had been sold across all platforms."
"Two Russian filmmakers, Liliya Tkach and Nikita Ordynskiy of Kinodom Productions, developed an 11-minute live-action film based on ""Papers, Please"", entitled ""Papers, Please: The Short Film"", starring Igor Savochkin as the passport inspector. The film was authorized by Lucas Pope after Ordynskiy sent him the screenplay via email. The film premiered at the Trekhgorka House of Culture in Moscow, Russia, on January 27, 2018. The film debuted worldwide via YouTube and the Steam storefront on February 24, 2018. The film received ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" reviews on Steam upon its release. The short film's success led Tkach and Ordynskiy to pursue a similar short film for ""Beholder"", another game set in a totalitarian state. Ordynskiy would later voice Seaman Aleksei Toporov in ""Return of the Obra Dinn"", a 2018 video game developed by Pope, which was also a Seumas McNally Grand Prize winner."

The Moondials experience was a pleasant one for Jackson, and it took a great deal of work for nominal Belle & Sebastian frontman Stuart Murdoch to convince him to join his group. At the time, Murdoch was playing the open mic circuit in Glasgow as a solo act, and it was at one of these performances, at The Halt Bar, that Jackson first saw Murdoch play."

"Christopher B. Galvin (born March 21, 1950) is an American businessman. He served as the chairman and chief executive officer of Motorola from 1997 to 2003."
"Christopher Galvin is the grandson of Paul Galvin, the founder of Motorola, and the son of Robert Galvin, who served as CEO of Motorola from 1959 to 1990. He received his BS in political science from Northwestern University and his M.B.A. from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University."
"From 1967 to 1973, during college, Galvin held part-time summer assignments at Motorola. From 1973 to 1983, he served full-time positions in sales, sales management, marketing management and mobile two-way radio product management, taking leave 1975–77 to attend graduate business school full-time. From 1983 to 1985, he became marketing director then general manager of the Tegal semiconductor equipment unit owned by Motorola Inc. In 1985, he became vice-president and director of Motorola's radio paging Division, where he sponsored the team that created one of the first virtually completely automated manufacturing operations in the US, called Project Bandit. Galvin was promoted to corporate vice-president and general manager of paging. In 1988, he was named chief corporate staff officer of the corporation, later senior vice president and appointed to the Policy and Operating Committees of Motorola Inc. In 1990, he was promoted to assistant chief operating officer and joined as the third member of the office of the CEO of Motorola Inc. In 1993, he was elevated to president and chief operating officer. In 1997, he became CEO. In 1999, he added the role of chairman of the board to that of CEO."
"Following the dot.com crash in 2000, he led a massive three-year restructuring of Motorola that included large lay-offs, closure of manufacturing facilities and reducing break-even costs. Simultaneously, Galvin led the renewal of Six Sigma Quality through Digital Six Sigma and introduced Motorola's MOTO language advertising campaign in 2002. The RAZR cellular phone was designed by Galvin's innovators in new product development methodologies created during the 2001–2003 timeframe. RAZR was introduced July 27, 2004. The innovations behind the RAZR was so cutting edge that even Galvin's eventual successor, Ed Zander, stated “There was a small team developing the RAZR before I got there. When I saw the technology, it blew me away.”"
"On September 19, 2003, the board of directors announced publicly it would seek another CEO. Galvin stated his objection to the board's view of Galvin's turnaround efforts, and stated, ""The Board and I do not share the same view of the pace, strategy and progress at this stage of the turnaround.”"
"Sixteen working days later, on October 13, 2003, Motorola Inc. reported that its global customer new product orders were up 25% company-wide and up 44% for cellular mobile phones in Q3 2003 compared to Q3 2002. Similarly, on January 20, 2004, Motorola Inc. reported on Galvin's last full quarter serving as CEO and the quarter of the board's search for a new CEO, Q4 2003, that Motorola's collection of global telecom, semiconductor, automotive, broadband-media and public safety customers increased new product line orders by 42% and by 64% in their cellular mobile phone business compared to Q4 2002."
"He was forced to resign on January 4, 2004. Seventy-seven working days later, on April 20, 2004, Motorola announced its financial performance for Q1, 2004, the quarter of Galvin's departure. The data showed that the then $30 billion run rate in annual revenue resulted in a 42% increase in sales corporatewide revenue growth, a 532% improvement in operating earnings, $0.9B in pre-tax earnings, $0.7B in free cash flow, and a resulting $0.9B net cash position on the balance sheet. Motorola Inc.’s cellular mobile phone business recorded an uptick of 67% sales revenue growth ($4.1B in quarterly sales) and earned a 9.8% operating margin for the period, three months before the RAZR phone was to be announced. At the time Motorola Inc.’s business portfolio included four Fortune 500 sized multi-billion business sectors compared to its six business sectors at the time. Zander, who assumed the CEO role on January 5, 2004, stated after the announcement of Q1 2004 financial results ""The first 90 days I talked to everybody. My agenda was very simple: learning the business as fast as I could. I did not want to shoot from the hip."""
"The following quarter, the financial performance initiated by Galvin proved sustainable and repeatable. On July 20, 2004, Motorola reported Q2 2004 results of increased sales revenue growth by 41% to $8.7B, an improvement in operating earnings by 394%, $800 M in pre-tax earnings, $800 M in free cash flow, and a $1.8B net cash position on the balance sheet. The cellular mobile phone business recorded an increased sales revenue growth of 67%, equating to $3.9B in quarterly sales while maintaining a 10.2% operating margin."
"In 2008, several years after Galvin's departure, a study was completed by the Monitor-Global Business Network consulting company to identify and compare the best + $5B in revenue global high tech corporate turnarounds since 1990. In comparing six-year periods including three years of turnaround actions and the corresponding companies’ resulting financial performance, the study placed Galvin's turnaround of Motorola as one of the top five large high tech turnarounds. The companies compared were IBM, Apple, Xerox, HP and Motorola."
"In 2010, he was featured in the Andrea Redmond book ""Comebacks: Powerful Lessons from Leaders Who Endured Setbacks and Recaptured Success on Their Terms"" (), which details his unplanned departure from Motorola, and how he responded."
"In 2014 Alan Murray, deputy managing editor and executive editor, online for ""The Wall Street Journal"", posted his review of ""Boards that Lead"", published by Harvard Business Review Press. The authors were Ram Charan, business advisor, Dennis Carey, vice chairman of Korn Ferry, and Michael Useem, professor at the Wharton Business School. Murray wrote, “Not all the book’s examples are success stories. Inevitably, Messrs. Charan, Carey and Useem devote a few pages to monumental failures. The authors tell the story of the board of Motorola Inc., which the authors blame for destroying the company. In 2004, it pushed out CEO Christopher Galvin (a grandson of the founder) just as his strategy was starting to deliver success, then replaced him with CEOs who enjoyed some early successes based on Mr. Galvin’s efforts, and then presided over the company’s decline and breakup.” The authors attribute this blunder to not backing a bet on solid technology or strategy, of which investment in technology had been the heart and soul of the Motorola culture, and having a reflexive response to the demands of investors, some of whom where short-term traders."

= = = Earl of Bellomont = = =
"Earl of Bellomont, in the Kingdom of Ireland, was a title that was created three times in the Peerage of Ireland. The first creation came on 9 December 1680 when Charles Kirkhoven, 1st Baron Wotton, was made Earl of Bellomont. He had already been created Baron Wotton, of Wotton in the County of Kent, in the Peerage of England on 31 August 1650. He was childless and both titles became extinct on his death in 1683."
"The second creation came on 2 November 1689 Richard Coote, 2nd Baron Coote, later Governor of New York, was made Earl of Bellomont. He was the son of Richard Coote, who had been created Lord Coote, Baron of Coloony, in the County of Sligo, in the Peerage of Ireland on 6 September 1660. Lord Coote was a younger son of Sir Charles Coote, 1st Baronet, and the younger brother of Charles Coote, 1st Earl of Mountrath (see Coote baronets for more information on this branch of the family). Lord Bellomont was succeeded by his elder son, Nanfan, the second Earl, who in his turn was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the third Earl. The earldom became extinct when the latter died without surviving male issue in 1766."
"The late Earl was succeeded in the barony of Coote by his first cousin once removed, Charles Coote, who became the fifth Baron. Charles was the son of Charles Coote (1695–1750), Member of Parliament for County Cavan, son of the Honourable Thomas Coote, a Justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland), younger son of the first Baron. On 4 September 1767 the earldom of Bellomont was created for the third time when Charles was made Earl of Bellomont (although the title was probably erroneously spelled ""Bell""a""mont"" in the letters patent). On 18 May 1774 Lord Bellomont was created a Baronet, of Donnybrooke in the County of Dublin, in the Baronetage of Ireland, with remainder to his illegitimate son Charles Coote. On his death in 1800 the barony and earldom became extinct as he left no surviving legitimate male issue. He was succeeded in the baronetcy according to the special remainder by his illegitimate son, Charles, the second Baronet (see Coote baronets for further history of this title)."

= = = Fan print with two bugaku dancers = = =
"Fan print with two bugaku dancers is an ""ukiyo-e"" woodblock print dating to sometime between the mid 1820s and 1844 by celebrated Edo period artist Utagawa Kunisada, also known as Toyokuni III. This print is simultaneously an example of the ""uchiwa-e"" (fan print) and ""aizuri-e"" (monochromatic blue print) genres. It is part of the permanent collection of the Prince Takamado Gallery of Japan at the Royal Ontario Museum, Canada."
"""Uchiwa"" (団扇) are non-folding, flat, oval fans. They are still used today for cooling rice in the preparation of sushi, in dance performances, and as a cooling tool. Historically, ""uchiwa"" were a predominantly female accessory, men typically carrying folding fans known as ""ōgi"" (扇), ""suehiro"" (末広) or ""sensu"" (扇子). They are associated with summer, traditionally having been sold only during the summer months, and decorated with summer imagery. At least one modern critic argues that, due to their use by women during periods of heat, ""uchiwa"" ""can have suggestive connotations."""
"Like ""ōgi-e"" (扇絵) folding fan prints, ""uchiwa-e"" were traditionally made from ""washi"" rice paper mounted on a wooden frame. Images were printed on paper, then cut along the margins and pasted onto a skeletal bamboo frame. As a result of their frequent handling, few pristine mounted examples remain."
"Also known as ""aizome-e"" (藍染絵) and ""ai-e"" (藍絵), ""aizuri-e"" (藍摺絵) translates literally as ""blue printed picture,"" and describes prints that are produced entirely or predominantly in shades of blue. A counterpart to ostensibly red and pink ""benizuri-e"" (紅摺絵), ""aizuri-e"" were a late Edo period development. Perhaps due to the fact that single colour prints were cheaper to produce, the ""aizuri"" technique was particularly popular for ""uchiwa-e""."
"In the past, some art historians theorized that ""aizuri-e"" arose as a result of an 1841 government ban on the use of lavish colour in the then-dominant ""nishiki-e"" (錦絵), multi-coloured woodblock prints. The existence of a number of prominent examples predating the ban, however, suggests that ""aizuri-e"" did not simply come about as an alternative to poly-chromatic images. While the earliest recorded use is in an 1829 print by Eisen, Utagawa Sadahide, Hokusai, Hiroshige, Toyokuni II and Kunisada all produced notable examples."
"The increased popularity of ""aizuri-e"" is directly linked to the 1829 importation of the first synthetic colouring agent to Japan. Known in the west as Prussian Blue, Berlin Blue, or ""bero"" (ベロ) as it came to be known, effectively challenged natural indigo as an ""ukiyo-e"" mainstay due to its lower price and decreased susceptibility to fading from light exposure. ""Aizuri"" has been described by one critic as having ""revolutionized landscape prints."""
"Given the lack of colour contrast in the monochromatic ""aizuri-e"", late Edo artists began to experiment with techniques to increase image complexity. This led to the development of ""bokashi"", a printing technique which allowed for the reproduction and mixing of differing colour tones within a single image. This is achieved through carefully graded applications of water and pigment mixtures to the woodblock with a ""hake"" brush. The result is a single-coloured print characterised by shading and tonality. It was practiced most effectively in the rendering of skies and water. While ""aizuri-e"" themselves were inexpensive to print, ""bokashi"" was costly. It is therefore generally seen in formal prints, and not regularly seen in cheaper media such as ""uchiwa-e"". Kunisada has, however, used the technique on this fan print, most notably in the cloud and ground regions, where the value of the blue pigment deepens from very pale blue to near-black opacity."
"Utagawa Kunisada (歌川国貞) was born in 1786 in the Honjō district of Edo (present-day Tokyo) into a wealthy family of ferry service owners. He began an apprenticeship with the head of the prestigious Utagawa school of artists, Toyokuni I, in 1807, and took the artist name Kunisada to include the second character (国 - kuni) of his mentor's name. In 1844, Kunisada succeeded his master as Toyokuni III (三代歌川豊国)."
"Kunisada emerged as a book illustrator in 1807 with the series ""Twelve Hours of the Courtesans"" (""Keisei jūnitoki""). ""Kuchi-e"" book illustrations were essential to the success of the then popular ""sharebon"" and ""kibyōshi"" books, and this soon became a lucrative market for Kunisada due to his talent and ambition. His position within the Utagawa studio afforded him access to training from the finest masters, and connections to publishers, actors, theatres and poet's associations. This, in turn, led to many commissions. By the early 1810s, he had opened his own studio, and demand for his illustrations had outstripped that for his master's. His great success was also reputedly linked to his ""convivial and balanced demeanor, and [the fact that] he delivered his commissions on time."""
"Kunisada was ""without a doubt... the most prolific and successful print artist of all time."" He was incredibly prodigious, creating between 35 and 40 thousand designs for individual ""ukiyo-e"" prints during his lifetime. His studio was larger than that of any other print artist, and he had a large stable of several dozen students. As a further indication of his unprecedented success, when he died in 1865 after having headed the Utagawa school for around 40 years, he was the subject of four separate ""shini-e"" memorial portraits. He is buried on the grounds of Banshōin Kōunji Temple in present-day Nakano ward, Tokyo, alongside Toyokuni I (1769–1825) and Kunisada II (1823–1880)."
"Like many artists of the Edo period, Kunisada was associated with a number of names throughout his lifetime."
"Although Kunisada designed many ""surimono"" and fan pictures, most of his works are in the ""ōban"" format. He also produced over sixty paintings."
"Given his incredible output, it is not surprising that Kunisada was active in various genres, including ""kabuki-e"" and ""yakusha-e"" (""kabuki"" actor pictures), ""bijin-ga"" (pictures of beauties), ""yūrei-zu"" (ghost pictures), ""sumō-e"" (sumo wrestler pictures), ""shunga"" (erotica), ""musha-e"" (warrior prints), and ""uchiwa-e"". He is also credited with popularizing ""Genji-e"", a print genre related to the 11th century novel ""The Tale of Genji"", through his 1829-1842 book series, ""Nise Murasaki inaka Genji"" (""A Country Genji by a Fake Murasaki""). In 1808, he began creating ""yakusha-e"", and these were to become the mainstay of his production, making up 60 to 70% of his total works. So prolific was he, that he came to be known as ""Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (""yakusha-e no Kunisada"")."""
"Two popular genres which are under-represented in Kunisada's oeuvre are nature images (""kachō-e""/ 花鳥絵) and landscapes (""fūkei-e""/ 風景絵). He rarely designed pure landscapes, but began in the 1820s or 1830s to incorporate landscape elements into prints featuring beautiful women and actors. ""Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers"" with its spare background landscape, is an example of this type of piece."
"Despite his success during his own period, Kunisada was not highly regarded in the west until quite recently. Critics today consider Kunisada to have been ""a trendsetter... in tune with the tastes of urban society,"" and credit him with a ""more humanized"" style than his contemporaries, and with bringing a sense of realism to ""ukiyo-e"", particularly in his depiction of the female form."
"Many argue, however, that the quality of Kunisada's later works degraded into ""gaudy and ostentatious"" use of colour, and ""lost... elegance in the human figure"". ""Ukiyo-e"" specialist Rupert Faulkner is particularly scathing, asserting that Kunisada's work ""became noticeably coarser and somewhat clumsy, revealing a cheap and gaudy caricaturism of grotesque facial expressions and exaggerated poses."" It has been suggested that his production generally suffered ""because of over-production and lowering of artistic standards,"" as well as possible mental or physical health issues, which led to Kunisada becoming a near-recluse in 1847. As art historian J. Hillier notes, ""Kunisada's career tells the tragedy of the downfall of ukiyo-e. With evident talent and tremendous verve, his early prints have qualities that link him with the great days of the school, but the great mass of his prints are hastily designed, over-coloured and badly printed."""
"The scene depicted on the fan is of two male ""bugaku"" dancers in full ceremonial costume, who appear to be performing a dance in lock-step with no audience in evidence. ""Bugaku"", made up of the characters for 'dance' (舞-bu) and 'music' or 'entertainment' (楽-gaku), joined Japanese culture from China, Korea, India and Southeast Asia in the late 8th century, as a form of dance performed at the imperial court, as well as at temples and shrines. Dancers assume stylized hand, arm and foot poses accompanied by drumming and the world's oldest surviving orchestral music, ""gagaku"". ""Bugaku"" is often performed by dancers wearing masks to represent fictional characters, though not in Kunisada's print. There are four ""bugaku"" genres: civil, warrior, children's, and running dances. The figures here appear to be performing the latter."
"From the late 1820s, Kunisada began studying painting under Hanabusa Ikkei (英一珪), master of the Itchō school. The art-name appearing on this print, ""Kōchōrō"" (香蝶楼), borrows characters from his teacher's pseudonym (Shinkō) and from the name of the school's founder, Hanabusa Itchō (英一蝶). Both of these artists painted ""bugaku"" scenes prior to ""Fan Print with two Bugaku Dancers,"" which are very different in style from Kunisada's image."
The print is signed near the right edge of the fan. It reads vertically from right to left and top to bottom as follows:
"The double circle mark below Kunisada's signature is a ""toshidama-in"", the distinctive seal used by all generations of the Utagawa school after Toyokuni I first adopted it, for reasons unknown, in 1808 or 1809. It is a lucky symbol, referencing gifts of coins given to children at New Year's. Kunisada gave the mark his own unique twist, elongating it and making it a yellow frame with red infill containing his signature. From 1850, he used this cartouche-style almost exclusively."
"The ROM dates the print to sometime between the mid-1820s and 1844; however, there are indications that the date can be narrowed to between 1830 and 1843. Synthetic blue pigment was not introduced to Japan until 1829, and it is unlikely that expensive natural indigo would be used on a medium as cheap as ""uchiwa-e"". Kunisada's signature is flanked by two circular ""toshidama-in"" seals rather than appearing within an oblong, stylized ""toshidama"" cartouche. This suggests the print belongs to his early career."
"The print was donated to the ROM by Sir Edmund Walker (1848–1924), who was the long-time president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and served as the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees for the ROM. Walker began collecting Japanese art in the 1870s, making him one of the earliest collectors in North America. He bought many of his pieces in New York between 1873–1875 and 1881–1886, and during a trip to London in 1909. In 1919, after travelling to Japan, China and Korea, he was named Honorary Consul-General of Japan for Toronto."

= = = Sturge–Weber syndrome = = =
"Sturge–Weber syndrome, sometimes referred to as encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a rare congenital neurological and skin disorder. It is one of the phakomatoses and is often associated with port-wine stains of the face, glaucoma, seizures, intellectual disability, and ipsilateral leptomeningeal angioma (cerebral malformations and tumors). Sturge–Weber syndrome can be classified into three different types. Type 1 includes facial and leptomeningeal angiomas as well as the possibility of glaucoma or choroidal lesions. Normally, only one side of the brain is affected. This type is the most common. Type 2 involvement includes a facial angioma (port wine stain) with a possibility of glaucoma developing. There is no evidence of brain involvement. Symptoms can show at any time beyond the initial diagnosis of the facial angioma. The symptoms can include glaucoma, cerebral blood flow abnormalities and headaches. More research is needed on this type of Sturge–Weber syndrome. Type 3 has leptomeningeal angioma involvement exclusively. The facial angioma is absent and glaucoma rarely occurs. This type is only diagnosed via brain scan."
"Sturge–Weber is an embryonal developmental anomaly resulting from errors in mesodermal and ectodermal development. Unlike other neurocutaneous disorders (phakomatoses), Sturge–Weber occurs sporadically (i.e., does not have a hereditary cause). It is caused by a mosaic, somatic activating mutation occurring in the GNAQ gene. Radiological findings will show tram track calcifications on CT, bilaterally."
"Sturge–Weber syndrome is usually manifested at birth by a port-wine stain on the forehead and upper eyelid of one side of the face, or the whole face. The birthmark can vary in color from light pink to deep purple and is caused by an overabundance of capillaries around the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, just under the surface of the face. There is also malformation of blood vessels in the pia mater overlying the brain on the same side of the head as the birthmark. This causes calcification of tissue and loss of nerve cells in the cerebral cortex."
"Neurological symptoms include seizures that begin in infancy and may worsen with age. Convulsions usually happen on the side of the body opposite the birthmark, which vary in severity. There may also be muscle weakness on the side of the body opposite the birthmark."
"Some children will have developmental delays and cognitive delays; about 50% will have glaucoma (optic neuropathy often associated with increased intraocular pressure), which can be present at birth or develop later. Glaucoma can be expressed as leukocoria, which should include also further evaluation for retinoblastoma. Increased pressure within the eye can cause the eyeball to enlarge and bulge out of its socket (buphthalmos)."
Sturge–Weber syndrome rarely affects other body organs.
"The blood vessel formations associated with SWS start in the fetal stage. Around the sixth week of development, a network of nerves develops around the area that will become a baby's head. Normally, this network goes away in the ninth week of development. In babies with SWS due to mutation of gene GNAQ, this network of nerves doesn't go away. This reduces the amount of oxygen and blood flowing to the brain, which can affect brain tissue development."
"CT and MRI are most often used to identify intracranial abnormalities. When a child is born with a facial cutaneous vascular malformation covering a portion of the upper or the lower eyelids, imaging should be performed to screen for intracranial leptomeningeal angiomatosis. The haemangioma present on the surface of the brain is in the vast majority of cases on the same side as the birth mark and gradually results in calcification of the underlying brain and atrophy of the affected region."
"Treatment for Sturge–Weber syndrome is symptomatic. Laser treatment may be used to lighten or remove the birthmark. Anticonvulsant medications may be used to control seizures. Doctors recommend early monitoring for glaucoma, and surgery may be performed on more serious cases. When one side of the brain is affected and anticonvulsants prove ineffective, the standard treatment is neurosurgery to remove or disconnect the affected part of the brain (hemispherectomy). Physical therapy should be considered for infants and children with muscle weakness. Educational therapy is often prescribed for those with intellectual disability or developmental delays, but there is no complete treatment for the delays."
"Brain surgery involving removing the portion of the brain that is affected by the disorder can be successful in controlling the seizures so that the patient has only a few seizures that are much less intense than pre-surgery. Surgeons may also opt to ""switch-off"" the affected side of the brain."
"Latanoprost (Xalatan), a prostaglandin, may significantly reduce IOP (intraocular pressure) in patients with glaucoma associated with Sturge–Weber syndrome. Latanoprost is commercially formulated as an aqueous solution in a concentration of 0.005% preserved with 0.02% benzalkonium chloride (BAC). The recommended dosage of latanoprost is one drop daily in the evening, which permits better diurnal IOP control than does morning instillation. Its effect is independent of ethnicity, gender or age, and it has few to no side effects. Contraindications include a history of CME, epiretinal membrane formation, vitreous loss during cataract surgery, history of macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion, history of anterior uveitis, and diabetes mellitus. It is also wise to advise patients that unilateral treatment can result in heterochromia or hypertrichosis that may become cosmetically objectionable."
"Although it is possible for the birthmark and atrophy in the cerebral cortex to be present without symptoms, most infants will develop convulsive seizures during their first year of life. There is a greater likelihood of intellectual impairment when seizures are resistant to treatment. Studies do not support the widely held belief that seizure frequency early in life in patients who have SWS is a prognostic indicator."
"It occurs in approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns."
It is named for William Allen Sturge and Frederick Parkes Weber.
"The Sturge-Weber Foundation's (The SWF) international mission is to improve the quality of life and care for people with Sturge–Weber syndrome and associated port wine birthmark conditions. It supports affected individuals and their families with education, advocacy, and research to promote effective management and awareness. The SWF was founded by Kirk and Karen Ball, who began searching for answers after their daughter was diagnosed with Sturge–Weber syndrome at birth. The SWF was incorporated in the US in 1987 as an International 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. In 1992, the mission was expanded to include individuals with capillary vascular birthmarks, Klippel Trenaunay (KT) and Port Wine Birthmarks."
The Hemispherectomy Foundation was formed in 2008 to assist families with children who have Sturge–Weber syndrome and other conditions that require hemispherectomy. The Brain Recovery Project was formed in 2011 to fund research and establish rehabilitation protocols to help children who have had hemispherectomy surgery reach their full potential.
"Sturge Weber UK (SWUK), formerly Sturge-Weber Foundation UK, is a volunteer run registered charity formed in 1990. The charity exists to support those affected by Sturge Weber syndrome, promote research into the condition and raise awareness of the condition amongst both public and professionals. The charity was instrumental in setting up a specialist Sturge Weber clinic at Great Ormond Street Hospital."
"It is important to maintain bioswales to ensure the best possible efficiency and effectiveness in removal of pollutants from stormwater runoff. Planning for maintenance is an important step, which can include the introduction of filters or large rocks to prevent clogging. Annual maintenance through soil testing, visual inspection, and mechanical testing is also crucial to the health of a bioswale."
"Bioswales are commonly applied along streets and around parking lots, where substantial automotive pollution settles on the pavement and is flushed by the first instance of rain, known as the first flush. Bioswales, or other types of biofilters, can be created around the edges of parking lots to capture and treat stormwater runoff before releasing it to the watershed or storm sewer."
"Bioswales work to remove pollutants through vegetation and the soil. As the storm water runoff flows through the bioswale, the pollutants are captured and settled by the leaves and stems of the plants. The pollutants then enter the soil where they decompose or can be broken down by bacteria in healthy soil."
"There are several classes of water pollutants that may be collected or arrested with bioswales. These fall into the categories of silt, inorganic contaminants, organic chemicals and pathogens."
"Bioswales can be implemented in areas that require stormwater management to regulate the runoff velocity and decontaminate the runoff. Bioswales are created to handle the first flush of pollutants during the event of rain, therefore, locations that have high areas of impervious surface such as roads, parking lots, or rooftops can benefit from additions of bioswales. They can also be integrated into road medians, curb cutouts, sidewalks, or any public space."
"Bioswales are useful low-impact development work to decrease the velocity of stormwater runoff while removing pollutants from the discharge. They are extremely beneficial in protecting surface water and local waterways from excessive pollution from stormwater runoff. The longer the runoff stays within the bioswale, the better the pollutant removal outcome. It is also beneficial in removing standing ponds that could potentially attract mosquitos. Bioswales can also be designed to be aesthetically pleasing and attract animals and create habitats. Bioswales can also be beneficial for groundwater recharge."
"Improper maintenance can lead to high restoration costs to address inefficient bioswales. An accumulation of large sediments, trash, and improper growth of vegetation can all affect the quality and performance of bioswales. It is beneficial at the planning stages to set apart easements to allow for easier maintenance of biowales, whether it be adequate space to locate machinery or safety to those working. Different types of filters can be used to catch sediments. Grass filter strips or rock inlets can be used to filter sediments and particulates; however, without proper maintenance, runoff could flow away from the bioswales due to blockage. Structural inlets have become more common due to the ease of maintenance, use, and its effectiveness. Avoiding the use of floating mulch and selecting the best fit low-maintenance plants ensure better efficiency in the bioswales. Depending on a community's needs for a bioswale, a four step assessment program can be developed. Visual inspection, capacity testing, synthetic runoff, and monitoring are the four steps that can be used to evaluate performance and maintenance of bioswales."
"Routine inspection is required to ensure that the performance and aesthetics of bioswales are not compromised. Time and frequency of inspections vary based on different local governments, but should occur at least once a year. Various aspects of inspection can take place, either visually or mechanically. Visual observation of the vegetation, water, and inlets are all crucial to ensure performance. Some organizations utilize checklists to streamline the visual inspection process."
There are different methods to determine if a bioswale needs maintenance. Bioswales are benchmarked to meet a specific level of infiltration to determine if maintenance is required. A staff gauge is used to measure the infiltration rate. Soil chemistry testing is also required to determine if the soil has a certain off-level of any pollutant. Phosphorus and high levels of salinity in the soil are two common pollutants that should be attended to. Analysis of inflow and outflow pollutant concentration is also another way to determine the performance level of bioswales.
"Maintenance can span to three different levels of care. Aesthetic maintenance is required to remove weeds that affect the performance of the other plants and the bioswale itself, clean and remove trash, and maintaining the looks of the vegetation. Partial restoration is needed when the inlet is blocked by sediments or when vegetation needs to be replaced. Full restoration is required when the bioswales no longer filter pollutants adequately and overall performance is severely lacking."
"Bioswales experience short, potentially intense, periods of rain, flooding and pollutant loading followed by dry seasons. It is important to take into account how the vegetation selected for the bioswales will grow and understanding what types of plants are considered the best fit."
There are four types of bioswales that can be constructed based on the needs of the location.
Bioswales require a certain soil composition that does not contain more than 5% clay. The soil itself before implementation should not be contaminated. Bioswales should be constructed with a longitudinal slope to allow sediments to settle. Maximum slope of bioswales is 3:1. A minimum clearance is required to ensure that other infrastructure would not be damaged. The overfill drain should be located at least 6 inches above the ground plain to allow for maximum concentration time of stormwater runoff in the bioswales. Rocks can also be used to slow down the runoff velocity. The use of filters is important to prevent inlets from becoming blocked by sediments or trash.
"Two early examples of scientifically designed bioswales for large scale applications are found in the western US. In 1996 for Willamette River Park in Portland, Oregon a total of 2330 lineal feet of bioswale was designed and installed to capture and prevent pollutant runoff from entering the Willamette River. Intermittent check dams were installed to further abet silt capture, which reduced by 50% suspended solids entering the river system."
"A second example of a large scale designed bioswale is at the Carneros Business Park, Sonoma County, California. Starting in 1997 the project design team worked with the California Department of Fish and Game and County of Sonoma to produce a detailed design to channel surface runoff at the perimeter of a large parking area. Surface runoff consists of building roof runoff, parking lot runoff and overland flow from properties to the north of the project site. A total of two lineal miles of bioswale was designed into the project. The purpose of the bioswale was to minimize runoff contaminants from entering Sonoma Creek. The bioswale channel is grass-lined, and nearly linear in form. Downslope gradient is approximately 4% and cross-slope gradient is approximately 6%."
"A relatively recent project established was the Seattle, Washington Street Edge Alternatives project, completed in 2001. Rather than using traditional piping, SEA's goal was to create a natural landscape that represented what the area was like before development. The street was 11% more pervious than a standard street and was characterized with evergreen trees and bioswales. The bioswales were planted on graded slopes with wetland and upland plants. Other landscaping also focused on native and salmon-friendly plants. SEA provided a strong benefit for stormwater runoff mitigation that helped continue to protect Seattle's creek ecology. The project street also created a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing site as opposed to hard landscaping."

"Selected Shorts is an event at New York’s Symphony Space on the Upper West Side, in which screen and stage actors read classic and new short fiction before a live audience. The stage show began in 1985 and continues today at Symphony Space's Peter Jay Sharp Theater."
"The annual season of the live events at Symphony Space begins in the mid-fall and ends in mid-spring. There is a theme to each Selected Shorts episode and performance. Several stories are presented around each theme. The stories are always fiction, sometimes classic, sometimes new, always performed by actors from stage, screen and television who bring these short stories to life. Evenings are often co-hosted by writers, literary producers, and other interesting characters."
"Selected Shorts was originally created by Kay Cattarulla, who in 1995 went on to create another successful literary program in Dallas, Arts & Letters Live, which is sponsored by the Dallas Museum of Art."
"Symphony Space's Artistic Director Isaiah Sheffer formerly hosted the live events, although many Selected Shorts also feature guest hosts, often well-known writers, who also choose which stories will be read. Mr. Sheffer died on November 9, 2012 at age 76. Actor BD Wong acts as the host of the live events since the fall of 2012."
"The readings are recorded live and become the basis of a one-hour radio program, hosted by actors, authors, and entertainers such as David Sedaris, Stephen Colbert, Cynthia Nixon, Wyatt Cenac, and Jane Kaczmarek, with literary commentator Hannah Tinti of One Story Magazine, and are produced in conjunction with WNYC. The programs are distributed by Public Radio International and air on PRI-affiliated public radio stations in the United States. The radio program airs weekly throughout the year."
"Originally, the program was distributed by National Public Radio. However, in October 2007, it moved its distribution to PRI, Public Radio International."

The basic subdivisions of Illinois are the 102 counties. Cook County is the only home rule county.
"Of the 102 counties, 85 are divided into townships. Cicero is within a township but both its township and municipal governments are carried out by the same governing body. The remaining 17 counties are divided into 261 precincts, instead of townships."
"Municipal governments are the cities, villages, and incorporated towns. The minimum size for incorporation as a city is 2,500, and the minimum size for incorporation as a village varies by the county population. Municipalities having a population above 25,000 automatically have home rule status, whereas smaller municipalities have the option via referendums."
Illinois has several types of school districts:
"Elected boards of education and boards of trustees (in the case of community college districts) govern these districts, except for the Chicago Public Schools and the City Colleges of Chicago, for which the boards are appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the Chicago City Council, and the special charter districts, which may have elected or appointed boards. The Illinois Board of Higher Education (IBHE) is the administrative agency with responsibility for overseeing all higher education in Illinois. With regards to the Illinois Community College System, the Illinois Community College Board (ICCB) is the state coordinating board for community colleges."
Area vocational centers and special education cooperatives may be formed by joint agreement between two or more school districts. A board consisting of representatives of each participating school district governs each entity of these two types. Educational service regions replaced the former county school units administered by county superintendents. Each region originally served one county but now may serve multiple counties because of minimum population requirements. Each region is headed by a regional superintendent of schools and is also governed by a regional board of trustees; the latter deal primarily with district boundary changes. Township land commissioners manage school lands and funds in certain counties. Educational service centers are established by the state board of education and function primarily to coordinate and provide special and ordinary services to affiliated school districts. These service centers are governed by boards consisting of members appointed by the regional superintendent.
"Special purpose districts in Illinois are forms of local government that are responsible for a narrow set of responsibilities. Illinois has the most special purpose districts of any U.S. state. The exact number depends on how one defines a “special purpose district.” The United States Census Bureau has determined that Illinois has 3,227 special purpose governments as of June 30, 2012. The Office of the Illinois Comptroller, which uses a broader definition that includes special districts without budget autonomy, determined the state has 4,755 as of December 2015."

= = = Conquest of the Western Turks = = =
"The conquest of the Western Turks, known as the Western Tujue in Chinese sources, was a military campaign in 657 led by the Tang Dynasty general Su Dingfang against the Western Turkic Khaganate ruled by Ashina Helu. The Chinese war against the Western Turks began in 640 with the annexation of the Tarim Basin oasis state Gaochang, an ally of the Western Turks. Several of the oasis states had once been vassals of the Tang Dynasty, but switched their allegiance to the Western Turks when they grew suspicious of the military ambitions of the Tang. Tang expansion into Central Asia continued with the conquest of Karasahr in 644 and Kucha in 648. Su Dingfang commanded the main army dispatched against the Western Turks, while the Turkic generals Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen led the side divisions. The Tang troops were reinforced by cavalry supplied by the Uyghurs, a tribe that had been allied with the Tang since their support for the Uyghur revolt against the Xueyantuo. Su Dingfang's army defeated Helu at the battle of Irtysh River."
"The victory strengthened Tang control of the Western Regions, now modern Xinjiang, and brought the regions formerly ruled by the Khaganate into the Tang empire. Puppet qaghans, the Turkic title for ruler, and military garrisons were installed to administer the newly acquired territories. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent as China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Arabic Umayyad Caliphate. Later on, Turkic revolts ended Chinese hegemony beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern Tajikistan and Afghanistan, but a Tang military presence remained in Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin. Central Asia absorbed cultural influences from the conflict. Turkic culture and language spread into Central Asia, as did artistic and political influences from the Tang Dynasty. Many of the Tang generals and soldiers stationed in the region were ethnically Turkic, and the prevalence of Indo-European languages in Central Asia declined with acceleration of Turkic migration. The Turks, Tibetans, and the Tang competed for control over Central Asia for the next few centuries."
"The empire of the Tang Dynasty (June 18, 618 – June 1, 907), successor of the Sui Dynasty, was a cosmopolitan hegemon that ruled one of China's most expansive empires. Raids by the nomadic Khitans and Turks challenged Tang rule, and Tang rulers responded by pursuing strategies of divide and conquer, proxy warfare, tributes, and marriages."
"Hostilities between the Tang and the Western Turks had existed since the founding of the dynasty. Emperor Gaozu, the first emperor of the Tang Dynasty, aided the assassination of a Western Turk qaghan on November 2, 619. Facing the threat of both the Western and Eastern Turkic Khaganates, Gaozu's successor Emperor Taizong formed an alliance with the Western Turks against the Eastern Turks, adopting a policy of allying ""with those who are far away to fight those who are close."""
"The westward expansion of the Tang Dynasty began with their wars against the Eastern Turks, Eastern Tujue in Chinese. Taking advantage of the political discord in the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, Taizong annexed the territory of the Eastern Turks in 629, beginning a period of rule that would last for the next fifty years. The nomads were driven out of the Ordos region and southern Mongolia and Taizong was declared a Great Khan by the defeated tribes, who surrendered and submitted to Tang rule."
"Several of the Tarim Basin oasis states switched their allegiance from the Tang Dynasty to the Western Turks. The oasis states Kashgar and Khotan surrendered to the Chinese in 632, as did the kingdom of Yarkand in 635. Tang military campaigns expanded further west against the remaining kingdoms of the Tarim Basin in southern Xinjiang beginning in 640. The king of Gaochang refused to submit to the Tang Dynasty as a suzerain. In 638, Emperor Taizong ordered a campaign led by general Hou Junji to invade Gaochang. Tang troops arrived in 640 and annexed the kingdom. A Western Turk army, sent to support Gaochang, retreated as the Tang forces approached."
"The nearby kingdom of Karasahr grew wary of the Chinese troops stationed at Gaochang, now under Tang domination. It refused to send tribute to the Tang court and formed an alliance with the Western Turks. A Tang campaign led by commander Guoxiao Ke captured the kingdom in 644 and installed a Tang loyalist as ruler. Military assistance by the Western Turks failed to deter the Tang forces. With the support of the Western Turks, the puppet ruler was later deposed, and another military campaign, led by the Tang general Ashina She'er, a member of the Turkic Ashina royal family, arrived in 648 to re-establish Tang control."
"After conquering Karasahr, She'er led his forces to the kingdom of Kucha. The army of Kucha, comprising 50,000 soldiers, lost to She'er. The king of Kucha fled with his soldiers to the kingdom of Aksu. After a forty-day siege, the king was captured and the Kucha forces surrendered on 19 January 649. Tang military garrisons were installed in the region to administer the annexed oasis states. These garrisons, known as the Four Garrisons of Anxi, were located in Kucha, Kashgar, Khotan, and Karasahr."
"Ishbara Qaghan (Ashina Helu), a member of the Ashina royal family, was previously a general under Emperor Taizong commanding Tang forces in Gansu. He led a revolt against the Tang and migrated westward, declaring himself Shabulou Qaghan and ruler of the Western Turkic Khaganate. Helu's rise to power unified the divided Turkic tribes under a single leader."
"After he established himself as qaghan, Ashina Helu led repeated raids on Tang settlements to the east. He also attacked the Tarim Basin, bringing the territory under Turkic rule for the next six years. Emperor Gaozong, the successor of Taizong, responded by sending Tang forces consisting of a main division led by Su Dingfang, and another led by Ashina Mishe and Ashina Buzhen, Western Turk rivals of Ashina Helu."
"Su Dingfang was a commander from south-central Hebei who, earlier in his career as an officer, was responsible for leading the attack against the military camp of Illig Qaghan, qaghan of the Eastern Turks. He also gained military experience as a leader of a regional militia during the civil war fought between the transition from Sui to Tang. Su was a general with military experience in Central Asia, and was familiar with the culture of the steppes. He had been in contact with military leaders from the region. He was one of nine multi-ethnic commanders invited by Emperor Gaozong to a military event in 655. The Turkic general Ashina Zhong, second cousin of Ashina She'er, was another commander in attendance."
"Su Dingfang's forces comprised Tang soldiers and 10,000 Uyghur horsemen. The Uyghur troops were provided by Porun, son of the Uyghur leader Tumidu Eltabar and enthroned by Taizong. The Uyghurs were allied with Tang China, who had supported their revolt against the reign of the Xueyantuo, a tribe of Tiele people. Porun joined Su Dingfang as a vice commander of the Uyghur cavalry in the military campaign against the Western Turks. The commanders of the Uyghur cavalry were the Yanran Protector-General and Vice Protector-General, administrators of the Yanran Protectorate near the Tang Xishouxiang military garrison."
"Su's army marched through the Central Asian steppes from Ordos, Inner Mongolia to the Altai Mountains region. His troops left Ordos in March and arrived in Kyrgyzstan in November, a journey spanning 3,000 miles across steppes and desert. Su avoided stopping at the resource rich oasis states, and historian Jonathan Karam Skaff speculates that the Chinese troops may have relied on livestock for food instead of a supply train, a tactic used by the steppe nomads. The campaign continued through the winter, when the steppes were covered in snow. Describing the journey's ordeal, Su Dingfang is reported to have said: ""The fog shed darkness everywhere. The wind is icy. The barbarians do not believe that we can campaign at this season. Let us hasten to surprise them!"""
"Commanders in the Tang army were familiar with the political culture of nomadic empires. Nomadic alliances were formed through distributing war plunder and ensuring the security of tribal property, and grew tenuous when rulers failed to deliver their promises. The Chinese understood that disaffected tribes were vulnerable to switching allegiances, and used this to their advantage."
"Su Dingfang recruited tribes to side with Tang, and these former tribal vassals of the Western Turks contributed additional soldiers. The tribe Chumukun offered their support after they were defeated by Su, and the tribe Nishu aided Su after their children and wives, originally captured by Helu, were returned along with gifts offered by the Tang."
"The battle was fought along the Irtysh River near the Altai Mountains. Helu's forces, consisting of 100,000 cavalry, were ambushed by Su as Helu chased decoy Tang troops that Su had deployed. Helu was defeated during Su's surprise attack, and lost most of his soldiers. Turkic tribes loyal to Helu surrendered, and Helu escaped to Tashkent in modern Uzbekistan. The retreating Helu was captured the next day after residents of Tashkent handed the qaghan over to the Tang. On the way back to the Tang capital, Helu is reported to have written:"
"The fifth part of ""Trinity War"" was given 4 stars out of 5 by Doug Zawiska at Comic Book Resources. He said, ""The pacing of ""Justice League Dark"" #23 is smart and gives readers lots to chew on, but it also leaves what seems like a lot left to be resolved in the approaching final chapter of ""Trinity War""."" He also praised Janin's ability to accurately draw the characters used in the issue. Joshua Yehl of IGN also had similar sentiments, saying ""While ""Trinity War’s"" overall story is wonky, this chapter of ""Justice League Dark"" at least makes it a fun time."" He also enjoyed Janin's art and gave the issue a 7.6 out of 10. Richard Gray of Newsarama gave the issue an 8 out of 10, saying, ""Everything about this issue feels like a climax...even if next week’s final chapter proves to be less than definitive."""
"IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave ""Constantine"" #5 a 6.5 out of 10, feeling that ""this issue doesn't seem to have much to add to the larger ""Trinity War"" picture,"" and that ""Ray Fawkes sets up the next storyline for this series, certainly, but there's little tangible impact on ""Trinity War""."" Comic Book Resources' Jennifer Cheng gave the issue 0.5 stars out of 5, stating the issue ""exhibits all the worst flaws of ""tie-ins"" or ""interludes"" for crossover event books [and] adds nothing to the big event and is almost useless to the ongoing title."""
"IGN's Joshua Yehl gave ""Trinity of Sin: Pandora"" #1 a 6.9 out of 10, saying ""Ray Fawkes definitely gets a lot of credit for telling a story that spans all the way from 8000 B.C.E. to the present and making it such a smooth read,"" but failed to ""kicks off the story without first giving a compelling reason to root for Pandora."" Yehl also praised the art, saying it looked ""impressively good"" despite the fact that there were four artists on the book. Jim Johnson of Comic Book Resources gave the first issue 2 stars out of 5, saying that the story is a ""protracted version of what readers have already learned in ""Phantom Stranger"" and elsewhere"" and criticizing the fact that Pandora's origin greatly differed from that of her Greek counterpart and the story had little to do with the ""Trinity War"". Like Yehl, Johnson also praised the fluidity of the art from Zircher, Cannon, Sampere and Cifuentes. Newsarama's Aaron Duran gave the title a 5 out of 10, saying the comic is simply okay and would have worked better as a shorter installment within other books or as bonus digital content."

= = = Rosine Guiterman = = =
"Rosine Guiterman (1886–1960) was a Sydney activist, teacher, poet and humanitarian."
"Guiterman was born Rosine Lion in London in 1886 and came to Australia with her family in 1893. She matriculated from high school and enrolled in Arts at Sydney University. She had a great love of Shakespeare's plays, this love having been instilled in her since early childhood by her mother. Her interest in Shakespeare came to the notice of Sir Mungo MacCallum, Sydney University's foundation Professor of Modern Language and Literature, and he inspired her to a lifetime study of Shakespeare. She graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1908."
"In 1911 she gained her Master of Arts degree in English, having achieved considerable prominence as a poet. Indeed, her poem ""Sic Vos Non Vobis"" (""Thus do ye, but not for yourselves"") won the coveted Sydney University Prize for English verse. She was the first woman to achieve this distinction."
"While at Sydney University she was very active in student activities, particularly in the Dramatic Society which gave her the skills which she would put to good use in her later commitment to theatre in Sydney. She also joined the Sydney University Women's Social Service Society and served on its committee from 1908 to 1910, being secretary from 1908 to 1909. In May 1909 she was instrumental in the Society and helped found the Sydney University Settlement which continues to provide social welfare services in the Chippendale and South Sydney area. This was an early indication of her strong commitment to social causes that was to be such an important part of her later life. It was in this period she became a close friend of the Australian feminist Jessie Street and other early social activists."
"In 1911, Rosine set off for London by boat, and she fell in love with a businessman, David Guiterman, who had boarded the ship in Colombo, Sri Lanka. By the time they reached England they were engaged. David Guiterman was, and always remained, a convinced socialist, with progressive ideas on religion, politics and human morality. Until they met, such explicit political ideas had never come Rosine's way."
"From 1911 to 1912 Rosine Lion with her sister, a trained kindergarten teacher, travelled extensively in France and Germany, teaching as she went. She then returned to Australia and Rosine and David were married at the Great Synagogue, Sydney on 10 September 1913. Their twenty-nine years of married life, in spite of much trouble, were happy. Their married life began with very bright prospects, David having been appointed to represent a German firm doing good business in Australia. However, eleven months later the First World War broke out. There followed a period of increasing social repression in Australia, in which the Australian government destroyed the white multiculturalism and plurality that had characterized pre-World War I Australia. This was to particularly affect those many Australians of German descent and heritage or those, like David Guiterman, who were associated with this large and vibrant component of Australian society."
"In this atmosphere of repression, the Australian Government confiscated the assets of David's firm, including his own money, and things became very difficult indeed for the newlyweds. David was an American of German descent, with a German name. In consequence David found it impossible to get another job. Rosine was ostracised by many former friends and even urged by some to leave her husband ""at least for the duration of the war"". It was strongly suggested that David Guiterman should change his name, but this he proudly refused to do, saying that it was a name that his parents and grandparents had borne with honour. His stand was almost universally condemned. They were both unalterably opposed to war as a method of settling international disputes and did not fear to say so. Rosine proudly stood by him and with unshakable courage had her first experience of taking an unpopular stance. In all likelihood it was this experience that led her to fight for the rest of her life for social inclusion, tolerance and human rights."
"These photographs of Rosine and David, and of Rosine, were probably taken in 1940 or 1941. David Guiterman died in 1942."
"David and Rosine had two children, Gertrude and Pauline. Gertrude inherited her parents’ strong socialist and activist views. She married John Williamson Legge in 1940 and they were both active members of the Australian Communist Party."
"In 1916, due to their straitened family financial circumstances as a result of the seizure of David's assets and his inability to gain employment, Rosine began to teach again - becoming a tutor of English and drama with the Workers' Educational Association. In 1917 after the birth of their two daughters, Rosine began part-time school teaching. Through her teaching career, three generations of school students benefited from her knowledge and love of the theatre. She worked tremendously hard. She may have neglected herself but never her family or her students. Her association with the W.E.A. lasted from 1916 to 1930, during which period she conducted very many classes and lectured at many summer schools."
"Rosine Guiterman engaged in school teaching continuously until 1950, including at SCEGGS Darlinghurst. Her main subjects were English and History and she was always the staff member to teach English and History honours. However, from time to time she also taught French and Latin. During this period she made many school broadcasts which were well received by both teacher and student listeners. In about 1940 Rosine commenced private coaching and continued to be a most successful teacher in this field up to the time of her death in 1960; her last lesson was given ten days before she died."
"Throughout her life, Rosine made a significant contribution to theater in Australia. In 1925 she was a co-founder of the Workers' Education Association Drama League. She was also active in the left-wing New Theatre in Sydney which was founded in 1932 and was where she could combine her theatrical skills with her social commitment. She acted in many plays, and gained early prominence through playing the leading role in Chekhov's ""The Schoolmistress"". Rosine also gained a significant reputation through her innovative Shakespearean productions. By 1938 she was sufficiently prominent in Sydney society to be the subject of an Archibald Competition painting by Joseph Wolinski."
"In 1933 Hitler came to power in Germany and there was a growing awareness among social activists in Australia of the growth in fascism in Germany. Rosine combined her commitment to the theatre with her concern at the growing menace of Nazism. On 21 November 1936 the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" reported:"
"""Mrs. Rosine Guiterman is producing Lessing's play, ""Nathan the Wise,"" this evening at the Maccabean Hall. A prologue will be spoken by Miss Amalia Lessing, a lineal descendant of the author, and by Mr. Arthur Mendelssohn, a descendant of Lessing's dearest friend, Moses Mendelssohn, whose character and ideas are expressed in the play. Miss Grace Barrow has designed the costumes and settings after a beautiful production she saw in Zurich. The proceeds of the performance will benefit the German-Jewish Relief Fund""."
"During the latter part of the 1930s, any German Jews who could possibly do so, escaped to any country where they could gain admittance, and many came to Australia. During this period the Guiterman home was ever open to newcomers in trouble, just as David Guiterman's office door was also always open. These two once calculated that approximately 600 to 700 refugees had come to their home with some type of problem."
"Many German children were coached in English by Rosine and subsequently shepherded through all ramifications of the Education Department, to ensure that they were graded according to ability and not held back through imperfect English. Many refugees, still with very little English, were assisted to obtain necessary medical or hospital attention. Education and medical assistance were just two of the host of problems which confronted the Jewish refugees, all of whom faced the trauma of being strangers in a strange land."
"Immediately after World War II, the Peace Council came into being with the object of working for the replacement of war by international co-operation. From its very inception, Rosine Guiterman identified herself with this movement, assisting to the maximum of her capacity in every way possible. She was also very active in many progressive causes including the Australia-China Association and the Union of Australian Women."
"She was an active member of the Australian-Aboriginal Fellowship and took part in the movement that brought about the successful 1967 referendum that changed the Constitution to allow the Federal Government to make laws relating to Aboriginal Australians. In this struggle, she played a particularly strong role in challenging the official government policy of ""assimilation"". She urged the adoption of the term ""integration"" to signal support of Aborigines' retaining a sense of group identity."
"In 1949, despite her full-time work as a teacher and social activist, she found time to write a book, ""Harriet Newcomb and Margaret Hodge: A Short Account of Two Pioneers in Education"", in order to help to keep alive the memory of two early feminists and educators."
"In 1949 she also published an article [“Emma Lazarus Centenary”, Unity: A Magazine of Jewish Affairs, (Vol. 2 No. 4.; Nov-Dec 1949; pp. 8–9) ] celebrating the centenary of the birth of the American poet Emma Lazarus and travelled to England where she became good friends with the poet Robert Browning who, Rosine reported, was delighted with her poems of indignation concerning abuses in the social system, or aiming at righting some wrong."
"Her strong and public commitment to social justice, despite the censure then being levelled at activists during the Cold War by the conservative government of R.G. Menzies, was well illustrated in 1953. When the impending execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg on charges of espionage galvanized liberal reaction around the world, she drew on her poetic skills, for which she had been awarded the Sydney University medal in 1911, to write an impassioned attack on the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" in reaction to the paper's headline: ""The execution of the Rosenbergs will end a two years' legal battle""."
The problem typically is introduced by formulating a hypothetical challenge of the following type:
"It seems obvious that there is no point in switching envelopes as the situation is symmetric. However, because you stand to gain twice as much money if you switch while risking only a loss of half of what you currently have, it is possible to argue that it is more beneficial to switch. The problem is to show what is wrong with this argument."
"Basic setup: You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each of which contains a positive sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains. You pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead."
The switching argument: Now suppose you reason as follows:
"The puzzle: ""The puzzle is to find the flaw in the very compelling line of reasoning above."" This includes determining exactly ""why"" and under ""what conditions"" that step is not correct, in order to be sure not to make this mistake in a more complicated situation where the misstep may not be so obvious. In short, the problem is to solve the paradox. Thus, in particular, the puzzle is ""not"" solved by the very simple task of finding another way to calculate the probabilities that does not lead to a contradiction."
"Many solutions resolving the paradox have been presented. The probability theory underlying the problem is well understood, and any apparent paradox is generally due to treating what is actually a conditional probability as an unconditional probability. A large variety of similar formulations of the paradox are possible, and have resulted in a voluminous literature on the subject."
Versions of the problem have continued to spark interest in the fields of philosophy and game theory.
"The total amount in both envelopes is a constant formula_1, with formula_2 in one envelope and formula_3 in the other.If you select the envelope with formula_2 first you gain the amount formula_2 by swapping. If you select the envelope with formula_3 first you lose the amount formula_2 by swapping. So you gain on average formula_8 by swapping.Swapping is not better than keeping. The expected value formula_9 is the same for both the envelopes. Thus no contradiction exists."
The step 7 assumes that the second choice is independent of the first choice. This is the error and this is the source of the apparent paradox.
"A common way to resolve the paradox, both in popular literature and part of the academic literature, especially in philosophy, is to assume that the 'A' in step 7 is intended to be the expected value in envelope A and that we intended to write down a formula for the expected value in envelope B."
Step 7 states that the expected value in B = 1/2( 2A + A/2 )
"It is pointed out that the 'A' in the first part of the formula is the expected value, given that envelope A contains less than envelope B, but the 'A', in the second part of the formula is the expected value in A, given that envelope A contains more than envelope B. The flaw in the argument is that same symbol is used with two different meanings in both parts of the same calculation but is assumed to have the same value in both cases."
A correct calculation would be:
If we then take the sum in one envelope to be x and the sum in the other to be 2x the expected value calculations becomes:
which is equal to the expected sum in A.
"In non-technical language, what goes wrong (see Necktie paradox) is that, in the scenario provided, the mathematics use relative values of A and B (that is, it assumes that one would gain more money if A is less than B than one would lose if the opposite were true). However, the two values of money are fixed (one envelope contains, say, $20 and the other $40). If the values of the envelopes are restated as ""x"" and 2""x"", it's much easier to see that, if A were greater, one would lose ""x"" by switching and, if B were greater, one would gain ""x"" by switching. One does not actually gain a greater amount of money by switching because the total ""T"" of A and B (3""x"") remains the same, and the difference ""x"" is fixed to ""T/3""."
Line 7 should have been worked out more carefully as follows:
"A will be larger when A is larger than B, than when it is smaller than B. So its average values (expectation values) in those two cases are different. And the average value of A is not the same as A itself, anyway. Two mistakes are being made: the writer forgot he was taking expectation values, and he forgot he was taking expectation values under two different conditions."
"It would have been easier to compute E(B) directly. Denoting the lower of the two amounts by ""x"", and taking it to be fixed (even if unknown) we find that"
"We learn that 1.5""x"" is the expected value of the amount in Envelope B. By the same calculation it is also the expected value of the amount in Envelope A. They are the same hence there is no reason to prefer one envelope to the other. This conclusion was, of course, obvious in advance; the point is that we identified the false step in the argument for switching by explaining exactly where the calculation being made there went off the rails."
We could also continue from the correct but difficult to interpret result of the development in line 7:
so (of course) different routes to calculate the same thing all give the same answer.
"Tsikogiannopoulos (2012) presented a different way to do these calculations. Of course, it is by definition correct to assign equal probabilities to the events that the other envelope contains double or half that amount in envelope A. So the ""switching argument"" is correct up to step 6. Given that the player's envelope contains the amount A, he differentiates the actual situation in two different games: The first game would be played with the amounts (A, 2A) and the second game with the amounts (A/2, A). Only one of them is actually played but we don't know which one. These two games need to be treated differently. If the player wants to compute his/her expected return (profit or loss) in case of exchange, he/she should weigh the return derived from each game by the average amount in the two envelopes in that particular game. In the first case the profit would be A with an average amount of 3A/2, whereas in the second case the loss would be A/2 with an average amount of 3A/4. So the formula of the expected return in case of exchange, seen as a proportion of the total amount in the two envelopes, is:"
This result means yet again that the player has to expect neither profit nor loss by exchanging his/her envelope.
"We could actually open our envelope before deciding on switching or not and the above formula would still give us the correct expected return. For example, if we opened our envelope and saw that it contained 100 euros then we would set A=100 in the above formula and the expected return in case of switching would be:"
"As pointed out by many authors, the mechanism by which the amounts of the two envelopes are determined is crucial for the decision of the player to switch or not his/her envelope. Suppose that the amounts in the two envelopes A and B were not determined by first fixing contents of two envelopes E1 and E2, and then naming them A and B at random (for instance, by the toss of a fair coin; Nickerson and Falk, 2006). Instead, we start right at the beginning by putting some amount in Envelope A, and then fill B in a way which depends both on chance (the toss of a coin) and on what we put in A. Suppose that first of all the amount ""a"" in Envelope A is fixed in some way or other, and then the amount in Envelope B is fixed, dependent on what is already in A, according to the outcome of a fair coin. Ιf the coin fell Heads then 2""a"" is put in Envelope B, if the coin fell Tails then ""a""/2 is put in Envelope B. If the player was aware of this mechanism, and knows that they hold Envelope A, but don't know the outcome of the coin toss, and doesn't know ""a"", then the switching argument is correct and he/she is recommended to switch envelopes. This version of the problem was introduced by Nalebuff (1988) and is often called the Ali-Baba problem. Notice that there is no need to look in Envelope A in order to decide whether or not to switch."
Many more variants of the problem have been introduced. Nickerson and Falk (2006) systematically survey a total of 8.
"The simple resolution above assumed that the person who invented the argument for switching was trying to calculate the expectation value of the amount in Envelope A, thinking of the two amounts in the envelopes as fixed (""x"" and 2""x""). The only uncertainty is which envelope has the smaller amount ""x"". However, many mathematicians and statisticians interpret the argument as an attempt to calculate the expected amount in Envelope B, given a real or hypothetical amount ""A"" in Envelope A. (A mathematician would moreover prefer to use the symbol ""a"" to stand for a possible value, reserving the symbol ""A"" for a random variable). One does not need to look in the envelope to see how much is in there, in order to do the calculation. If the result of the calculation is an advice to switch envelopes, whatever amount might be in there, then it would appear that one should switch anyway, without looking. In this case, at Steps 6, 7 and 8 of the reasoning, ""A"" is any fixed possible value of the amount of money in the first envelope."
"This interpretation of the two envelopes problem appears in the first publications in which the paradox was introduced in its present-day form, Gardner (1989) and Nalebuff (1989). It is common in the more mathematical literature on the problem. It also applies to the modification of the problem (which seems to have started with Nalebuff) in which the owner of Envelope A does actually look in his envelope before deciding whether or not to switch; though Nalebuff does also emphasize that there is no need to have the owner of Envelope A look in his envelope. If he imagines looking in it, and if for any amount which he can imagine being in there, he has an argument to switch, then he will decide to switch anyway. Finally, this interpretation was also the core of earlier versions of the two envelopes problem (Littlewood's, Schrödinger's, and Kraitchik's switching paradoxes); see the concluding section, on history of TEP."
"This kind of interpretation is often called ""Bayesian"" because it assumes the writer is also incorporating a prior probability distribution of possible amounts of money in the two envelopes in the switching argument."
"The simple resolution depended on a particular interpretation of what the writer of the argument is trying to calculate: namely, it assumed he was after the (unconditional) expectation value of what's in Envelope B. In the mathematical literature on Two Envelopes Problem a different interpretation is more common, involving the conditional expectation value (conditional on what might be in Envelope A). To solve this and related interpretations or versions of the problem, most authors use the Bayesian interpretation of probability, which means that probability reasoning is not only applied to truly random events like the random pick of an envelope, but also to our knowledge (or lack of knowledge) about things which are fixed but unknown, like the two amounts originally placed in the two envelopes, before one is picked at random and called ""Envelope A"". Moreover, according to a long tradition going back at least to Laplace and his principle of insufficient reason one is supposed to assign equal probabilities when one has no knowledge at all concerning the possible values of some quantity. Thus the fact that we are not told anything about how the envelopes are filled can already be converted into probability statements about these amounts. No information means that probabilities are equal."
"In steps 6 and 7 of the switching argument, the writer imagines that that Envelope A contains a certain amount ""a"", and then seems to believe that given that information, the other envelope would be equally likely to contain twice or half that amount. That assumption can only be correct, if prior to knowing what was in Envelope A, the writer would have considered the following two pairs of values for both envelopes equally likely: the amounts ""a""/2 and ""a""; and the amounts ""a"" and 2""a"". (This follows from Bayes' rule in odds form: posterior odds equal prior odds times likelihood ratio). But now we can apply the same reasoning, imagining not ""a"" but ""a/2"" in Envelope A. And similarly, for 2""a"". And similarly, ad infinitum, repeatedly halving or repeatedly doubling as many times as you like. (Falk and Konold, 1992)."

"In 2012, the Italian company GlassUp was founded by Francesco Giartosio and Gianluigi Tregnaghi to develop and market its augmented reality eyewear display. Initially, the project started in June 2011, when Francesco and his team saw an augmented reality glasses concept video. Following it, the team researched the eyewear display market and in September 2011 it sought and hired Gianluigi Tregnaghi, the biggest field expert in Italy, who developed optical systems for airplane pilots' helmets. In the summer of 2012, the team thought it found the solution that would hit the mark, and patented it."
"At CeBIT 2013, the company showcased its project to turn a pair of glasses into a head-mounted secondary display for the smartphone. The prototype device featured a projector that beams images onto the glass panel baked into the right-side lens as well as a yellow-and-black, 320 x 240 resolution display. The company planned to release two versions, one with Bluetooth 4.0 and one with Bluetooth 3.1 to ensure a wide range of compatibility with Android and iOS devices, and aimed to have finished versions ready for the Augmented World Expo in June 2013."
"At the same time, the company planned to start Kickstarter campaign to generate the funds necessary for a pre-sale, priced at $399 / €299. It spent two months setting up a company in the US, opening a bank account, an Amazon account, getting a tax number and seeking a local resident. At the end, it came out that Kickstarter does not accept the eyeglasses category anymore. On 9 June 2013 GlassUp started an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds and as of 18 August the campaign has raised $105,641 of its pledged goal of $150,000."

The company's patented EnhancedView technology uses a unique optoelectronic device based on a semi-reflective diopter with a mathematically calculated curve enabling the reflection of a virtual collimated image directly into the wearer's field of view. The use of EnhancedView technology, coupled with an OLED micro-screen provides a 40 ° x 30 ° (H x V) field of vision with a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels or more. This is equivalent to viewing a floating screen of 90 cm diagonal at a distance of one meter. It is the result of an intensive collaborative development work with the Institut d'Optique and the University of Paris-Sud over several years."
"In September 2006, the company won a research grant for the development of a prototype demonstrator for augmented reality in French Museums. It worked on this project with four partners: INRIA, Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie, the Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University and Naska films. In July 2009, the company presented the augmented reality experience ""Observe the Earth in 3D"" at the inauguration of the permanent exhibition Explora, ""Objective : Earth"" at the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie. A projected video of Earth globe was placed at the center of a semi-circular table. Visitors are placed around the table and wear Laster glasses which allows them to see the Earth globe and overlay of virtual satellites around the Earth."
"In June 2008, Innovega was co-founded by the former MicroVision employees: Randall Sprague, Steve Willey and Jerome Legerton. The company developed the iOptik eyewear display. It comprises a pair of contact lens which refocus polarized light to the pupil and allows the wearer to focus on an image that is as near as 1.25 cm to the eye, thus enabling displays to be built into normal-looking glasses without the bulky optics. In April 2012, the company signed a contract to deliver a fully functioning prototype to the Pentagon’s research laboratory, DARPA. At CES 2013, the company demonstrated a prototype of its eyewear display that features a field of view of 60 degrees or more. It also claimed that a field of view of nearly 120 degrees is already in the works. The first version of Innovega's glasses are designed for military use, but it is planning a consumer version by 2014 or 2015."
"At SID 2012, the German institute Fraunhofer COMEDD presented for the first time an evaluation kit of its OLED-based eyewear display which enables the user to test the technology and develop applications The institute successfully developed OLED-on-silicon microchips, which are display and camera at the same time, and can be integrated into eyeglasses with an appropriate optical construction. At the moment the eyewear display can be offered with a bright red shining OLED display, but the scientists of Fraunhofer COMEDD are currently working on the possibility to provide the information in full-color so that people can experience whole film sequences. Fraunhofer COMEDD is working in partnership with Fraunhofer IOSB who is developing the eye-tracking capabilities for the eyewear and Trivisio who is responsible for the eyewear design."
"TRIVISIO was founded in 2003. The company develops and produces head-mounted displays. The wireless inertial motion trackers developed by TRIVISIO, are operational in the production for movement control by industrial companies, as well as in the medical field. In partnership with research institutions and companies, the company optimize customize optics, micro-electronics and mechanics. TRIVISIO has thus developed a proprietary technological toolbox."
"On 10 September 2012, TTP announced that it developed an eyewear that looks like conventional glasses and uses transparent, curved lenses that do not obstruct the wearer's field of view. The technology works by using an embedded low-power, miniature projector optics to project a light at an angle of approximately 45° towards the lens that contains an embedded grating structure to redirect the light into the eye, as well as performing a number of other optical functions such as astigmatic compensation. It also invented a very high speed switchable fast focus lens technology that can be used to create a true 3D experience. The September 2012 prototype can only show a monochrome, 640 x 480 image, not a moving video, but the hardware to do that is expected to be ready for the next model. An electrode mounted at the temple of the eyewear can measure an electronic signal in the muscles to figure out which way the eyes are looking and that is translated into UI. The company is not planning to manufacture its display or eye-tracking technology, but instead hopes to license it to third parties. It is currently in negotiation with a California-based company."
"In January 2013, the Japanese company Telepathy was founded by the augmented reality entrepreneur Takahito Iguchi. At SXSW 2013 the company unveiled the Telepathy One, an eyewear display that consists of a small micro projector to create a virtual 5-inch screen that appears to float in front of the wearer's eye and a built-in micro camera. It uses an OS built off Linux and can connect to other devices via Bluetooth. It allows users to receive e-mails, check updates on social networks, and even share whatever scene the user is looking at with his friends. A Consumer version is expected to hit the US before the 2013 Christmas season."
"Founded in March 2004, the Taiwanese company Oculon Optoelectronics is a well-experienced optoelectronics company that has been engaged in the design and the development of head-mounted display (HMD) and a series of light-weighted portable display products. At Computex Taipei 2013 the company demonstrated a prototype of its Oculon Smart Glasses, an eyewear display which is expected to compete the Google Glass with better screen, longer battery life and less than half the price. The prototype carries a 640×480-pixel resolution, but the final version will have a 720p display. Images appear translucent, making them easy to see through. It will be offered in two versions – monocular and binocular – while the Google Glass only offers a monocular version. Among Oculon's features will be speech recognition, gesture control and the ability to connect to a Bluetooth control pad for navigation. The company expects to go into mass production of the Oculon by late 2013 and is hoping to hit an MSRP of $500. As an OEM, Oculon will not release the Smart Glasses on its own, but instead will sell it to a variety of vendors who will take the device to market under their own brands. Consumer versions are expected to be released by late 2013."
"At MWC 2013, Fujitsu showcased the Laser Head Set (LHS), a headset display that uses a laser to project a high-resolution video onto a clear mirror in front of your eye which bounces it back into the retina. It provides a field of view of 40 degrees and produces a translucent image, letting the user look through the projected image to see his surrounding. It was developed in collaboration with the University of Tokyo and QD Laser Inc. By Mobile World Congress 2014, Fujitsu plans to debut the Laser Eye Wear (LEW), based on the same technology that is condensed into a pair of normal-looking glasses."
"On 1 April 2013, an article at Sina Tech reported that the Chinese search giant Baidu is allegedly testing Baidu Eye, a monocular eyewear display which features a miniature LCD display, camera for taking pictures, bone conduction technology, and some sort of facial recognition search. It has been in development for several years by a team under the direction of Baidu's chief product designer Sun Yun-feng. The company intends to develop a wearable device industry standards and to license it to manufacturers. Based on its cloud ecosystem, it plans to launch an application store so developers can create apps for the device. It also cooperation with Qualcomm, to use its latest power control chip to reduce the power consumption and by that to extend the battery life to 12 hours or more. This device is fully functional by voice commands. It was at first thought to be an April Fools' Day joke, but on 3 April its existence was confirmed to Mashable by Baidu's director of international communications, Kaiser Kuo. A working prototype has been built."
"Vufine is a California-based company that manufactures a glasses-mounted display. The company launched on Kickstarter on 24 July 2015 and is intended to be a cheaper alternative to the Google glass. It is only a display, lacking an onboard computer. Users can stream HDMI data to the headset."
"In May 2011, Microsoft filed patents for an optically see-through eyewear display with augmented reality capabilities. The patent describes how it could augment the wearer's view by using the device. For instance, it could be used at a baseball game to show a player's statistics, provide details of characters in a play, or at an opera house to show the lyrics next to the opera singer as an alternative to displays placed at the side of the stage. It also states that the eyewear display could be operated by a wrist-worn computer, voice-commands or by flicking the eyes to a certain spot. In 2012, a two-year-old 56-page roadmap document by Microsoft appeared on Scribd. It revealed that Microsoft's Innovation Center in Fortaleza, Brazil is developing the code-named Fortaleza, an eyewear display that appears to be Wi-Fi and 4G-enabled and incorporates augmented reality. It also revealed plans to make it capable of syncing with Microsoft's Xbox One and the Kinect. No concrete release date was given, but the document suggests sometime in 2014 at earliest. The document was removed at the request of Covington & Burling LLP, an international law firm that represents Microsoft. The file has since found a home on multiple hosting services and websites, but soon afterwards Microsoft sent takedown notices to sites that were hosting the document, including Dropbox. Ihned.cz, a technology site based in the Czech Republic, received a notice from Alan Radford, Internet Investigator on behalf of Microsoft for hosting the document. In 2014, Microsoft revealed the device, naming it HoloLens. In an 6 October 2015 event Microsoft demonstrated the demo of HoloLens and made its developer edition available at $3000."
"In March 2013, the Boston-startup LAFORGE Optical was founded by five former and current students of the Rochester Institute of Technology, with the intention to design and market an eyewear with an embedded heads-up display system. In December 2013, the company launched pre-order sales of its Icis eyewear on the company's official website for $220. This plan was then abandoned for the release of a new pair of eyewear LAFORGE dubbed Shima. These went on sale on the company's official website for $590 under the marketing banner of an alpha/beta product release. Since then there have been multiple delays and a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the actual availability of the glasses."
"At Ceatec trade show, Toshiba unveiled the Toshiba Glass, a prototype of pair of glasses with a tiny, lightweight projector which displays an image. Toshiba Glass was jointly created by Yamamoto Kogaku Co. which makes glasses under the Swans brand."

"""Shakugan no Shana"" details an age-old conflict between those who inhabit the , a parallel universe to the human world. The Crimson Realm is populated by who are able to manipulate the , a fundamental power within any biological entity and functions as ""fuel"" for one's existence. Denizens whose power stands out among their peers are known as , and Lords that are even more powerful are known as . Denizens who do not care about the balance between the Crimson Realm and the human world collect Power of Existence from humans to use for their own purposes. It is the duty of , humans who have formed contracts with a Crimson Lord, to maintain the two worlds' balance by killing any Denizens disrupting it. Denizens and Flame Haze fight with the use of powerful magic spells called , which are also known as Unrestricted Spells or Unrestricted Methods. One such spell is the , which creates a space where the Crimson Realm and the human world intermingle and all sorts of causalities, including time, are stopped for ordinary living beings."
"The story largely takes place in Misaki City in Japan and begins when high school student Yuji Sakai is thrown into the middle of this conflict and encounters a Flame Haze girl with flaming red eyes and hair dressed in all black wielding a katana. The girl informs him that he died some time ago, and that he is a , a human with greatly diminished Power of Existence, and whose remaining Power of Existence will slowly run out. In addition, Yuji is a , a special kind of Torch who contains a , a magical object created by Denizens that can provide special abilities or even Powers of Unrestraint; additionally, Mystes can move within Seals. Unfazed by his apparent death, Yuji befriends the girl and names her ""Shana"" after her sword. They later discover that the Treasure Tool within Yuji is the , which restores his Power of Existence every night at midnight."
"As time goes on, Shana and Yuji encounter several more Flame Haze, such as Margery Daw and Wilhelmina Carmel, and Denizens in Misaki City. An organization of Denizens called Bal Masqué discovers that Yuji possesses the Reiji Maigo and attempt to use the Treasure Tool on two separate occasions. Bal Masqué is led by three Lords called the Trinity: Hecate, Sydonay, and Bel Peol. They serve under a Crimson God known as the , who resides within the Reiji Maigo. When the Snake of the Festival emerges, it merges its consciousness with Yuji's, assuming command over Bal Masqué, and together they formulate an elaborate plan to create a parallel world called Xanadu, which will serve as a paradise for Denizens with unlimited Power of Existence. Shana, and all of the other Flame Haze around the world, oppose the creation of Xanadu, which would eventually cause a large-scale disruption in the human world, the Crimson Realm and Xanadu itself."
"Shana formulates a countermeasure and is ultimately successful in adding a single law to Xanadu where the Denizens are not allowed to eat humans anymore. With Xanadu created, the Denizens depart to the new world, soon followed by hundreds of Flame Haze determined to help enforce order on it. Yuji intends to go to Xanadu alone and make sure humans and Denizens can eventually learn to coexist, but Shana refuses to be left behind. In the end, Yuji accepts Shana's feelings and the two kiss, which activates a spell left to Yuji by Crimson Lord Lamia that restores his existence, so Yuji is no longer a Torch. With the help of another spell from Lamia, Yuji successfully restores all humans in Misaki City whose existence was absorbed by the Denizens before he and Shana depart for Xanadu together."
"In an early draft of what would later become ""Shakugan no Shana"", Yashichiro Takahashi set the story in a different dimension and described the main character as having the initial personality of Shana, but the appearance of an older woman similar to Margery Daw. However, after talking with an editor, Takahashi rewrote the character to have the appearance of a young girl. In doing so, he used Shana's small build to symbolize a story of growth and to emphasize the physical conflict between her and her opponents. Noizi Ito was contacted in early August 2002 to be the illustrator for the series, and she was very excited to work on the project after she read the manuscript for the first novel; this was the first time Ito drew illustrations for a book."
"Shortly before writing ""Shakugan no Shana"", Takahashi made his debut as an author with ""A/B Extreme"", which was awarded an honorable mention in the eighth Dengeki Novel Prize by MediaWorks (now ASCII Media Works) in 2001. By his own admission, ""A/B Extreme"" was too difficult for readers to understand, so for his next work, he set out to write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of ""Shakugan no Shana"" was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor."
"""Shakugan no Shana"" began as a light novel series written by Yashichiro Takahashi, with illustrations drawn by Noizi Ito. ASCII Media Works published 26 volumes between November 9, 2002 and November 10, 2012 under their Dengeki Bunko imprint; 22 comprise the main story, while the other four are side story collections. A short story was later published in the September 2017 issue of ASCII Media Works' ""Dengeki Bunko Magazine"". Viz Media licensed the novels for English distribution in North America, but they only released two volumes in 2007. The novels are also licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., and in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media."
"A 160-page guide book titled was published on December 10, 2005 by ASCII Media Works. Two more guide books were published by ASCII Media Works for the anime adaptations: on October 27, 2006 with 176 pages, and on October 19, 2009 with 168 pages. Four 128-page art books illustrated by Ito were published by ASCII Media Works: on February 25, 2005, on August 9, 2007, on August 10, 2009, and on August 9, 2013."
"A manga adaptation, illustrated by Ayato Sasakura, was serialized in ASCII Media Works' manga magazine ""Dengeki Daioh"" between the April 2005 and October 2011 issues. The individual chapters were collected and published in ten ""tankōbon"" volumes from October 27, 2005 and October 27, 2011. A special limited edition version of volume two was bundled with a booklet titled ""Grimoire"" including contributions from guest artists and writers for various illustrations, manga, and short stories. Viz Media licensed the manga for English distribution in North America. Viz released six volumes between April 17, 2007 and September 21, 2010, but then cancelled the release of the final four volumes. The manga is also licensed in South Korea by Daewon C.I., in Taiwan and Hong Kong by Kadokawa Media, and in Germany by Egmont."

The player assumes the role of Yuji Sakai during the visual novel aspect, where much of the game's duration is spent on reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents the story's narrative and dialogue."
"The game follows a branching plot line through eight chapters with five possible endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Every so often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Sometimes during text progression, an ""active countdown"" minigame appears, which requires the player to press the game buttons in a specific order in a set time limit. Success or failure in these minigames influence which endings are viewed. During the turn-based battle sequences, the player assumes the role of Shana. The player uses a combination of fire, powers of unrestraint, and treasure tools to battle Crimson Denizens; and Shana is also able to use a special attack and defend."

"In October 2014, the novels were reported to have sold over 8.6 million copies. As reported on the obi strip on volume 4 of the ""Shakugan no Shana"" manga released in January 2008, 1.2 million copies of the manga had been sold. Theron Martin from Anime News Network reviewed the manga and called it ""inferior"" to the anime, and notes the anime develops characters better than the manga. Martin also critiques the art, saying the background art has little detail, and while the action scenes are handled well enough, they are still sub-par compared to the same scenes in the anime. Martin concludes the review by warning the readers that ""[if] this is your first exposure to the franchise, look to the anime version to see it done right."""
"When reviewing the anime, Martin thought the first ""Shakugan no Shana"" always manages to slightly exceed expectations, and while its story elements may be typical, its execution is not. Martin noted that Shana's Flame Haze transformation is a visual highlight of the series, and other details are shown equal care. Reviewer Chris Beveridge of Mania.com felt uncomfortable about the morbid nature of the series. While Beveridge did not think the series is ""groundbreaking"", it proves to be a ""solid title"" that continuously gets better. The pacing in the middle of the first season was criticized for quickly ending an arc before ""going into a storyline that feels out of character for the show."" Martin's review of ""Shakugan no Shana Final"" was less positive; he described Yuji as having been made into a different character (though his complexity was praised), criticized the addition of a large number of prominent characters without sufficient development, and described some things as not making sense, although he praised Shana's development over the course of the third series."
