The blooming Creme Eggs are on sale all the year round  and then they run out at Easter.
"That's happened, I couldn't get any  one year  I took the triplets to the erm  Goose Hill coffee morning in the Town Hall and I gave them all money for the tombola  and one of them  won a Creme Egg"
"but I persuaded him that it would melt while he had his drink and to put it in my bag  and er  it was lunchtime when we got home and we were going some  I, I can't remember what we were doing afterwards  so I gave it to his mother, I thought she could share it."

Mhm.
"and he's, he's just  ke you know what I mean, I think he's, he's getting an extension so that's why there's a bit of delay on that."

"And then we sat  at the far side of the Old Gate bridge  and er  an old lady came along  and said, and she was counting them  but she said, just look at that thing, she counted seven  although, in actual fact, by then  th these dra the seven drakes had stopped cha chasing the duck and they were all sitting down."
"And a there was a domestic one  in each group  there was one along near the baths in among the thirteen, and there was another white one  near Old Gate Bridge."
"I gave my top group your algebra homework today  they said  Pau is this Paul's homework, I said yes  that's not fair  I said why isn't it fair?"
"Well it's too hard, I said how do you know it's too hard?"
And they all did it  apart from Chris   who said  urgh she always works us too hard!

"when I think about it I think  I just can't work, it's like, I've lost interest  whenever I find some  I feel I'm able to keep up"
Mm
which is something I
Mm.
"I mean want to  I have considered going back to er, training and cancel this"
"Right, I see, what dropping this altogether?"
"Er, no, I'd like to come in."
Mm.
I mean I don't particularly like
Mm.
Yeah.
and perhaps after that come back to
Right.
I really
"Well, the, I mean the, the thing about the end fill is"
Four legs good!
Two legs bad!
"Unless you're a chicken, or to put it boldly, animals have rights too!"
But exactly what rights do they have?
And does supporting animal rights justify violence?
"The animal rights lobby is a forceful one  by various means, some legal, some not, some specific, some violent."
Campaigners seek to convince the unconverted that animals deserve a better deal!
Which animals?
Yeah I've read about it.
According to this thing in the paper they er had a hundred and thirty people.
Mm.
And er
Hundred and thirty!
Well  that's what is says there .
You could
quite a lot don't they?
Protestors were joined by York MP Hugh Bailey and City Councillors as they gathered at Heworth on Saturday.
Erm I'm surprised that slightly surprised that with council and Hugh were willing to go down given what we had given our information about how dangerous or not the site actually is.
That it's not very nice but it's er
I didn't know Heworth was gonna be that
Yes.
until it mentioned
They're also apparently  with ill health and amongst people living in the surrounding area.
Whether there's any truth in this is  and the A A E who did the er survey include Atomic Energy Authority who who's  like that as well.
Right okay.
I think we must have missed a briefing from
Must must have done.
Might might be the one when you were away.
Right well there's a nice er we did get in the paper.
We did.
Mm.
Right any tasks to carry forward?
Well erm Steve asked  to write letters to to Penny .
I don't know whether Jean got John  to have written to Jean  or not.
I think he might have done but he didn't say.
Erm apart from that I think we've done everything this week.
Can you just quick quickly fill me in on what this letter to Penny  is?
It was about the supporters' campaign in the last
Yeah.
there's an article about  erm where is it here somewhere  .
Was it?
It is when you see us struggling against Birmingham.
What do you think the score's gonna be against Birmingham?
Three one to Palace.
Three one to Palace?
Be great if that is.
We will score first.
They will equalize and we'll score two more.
We have got to get another goalgetter.
I mean old erm   does his bit  crossing and splitting defences and getting goals but not scoring them.
"What do you mean, getting goals and then not"
"Now, well now  it's just now we've got nobody who, who score actually really scores goals  except Thomas I would say at the moment."
We really do need somebody who regularly pops them in.
What about Gabbiadini?
What about Gabiadini?
Well  he's coming along.
I don't see him
"I think he  he had a really good first half  I think it like, I think that  to be fair, apart from Coleman an Southgate everybody faded in the second half didn't they?"
Yo.
Yo
Yeah.
"What's that, Man United fans?"
Wallington.
Where's Wallington?
Oh that's boring.
Why are we going this way then?
"Are, are Manchester United not the most cockiest fans going aren't they?"
They really are cocky .
Yeah.
"Leeds, I like Man United, I don't, I don't hate them or anything I just, they get a bit I dunno."
"Mind you not that they've had an awful lot of success recently but they are, really are a cocky lot."
Leeds are aggressive so you're always quite glad that you've beaten them but .
Again if I collect more material than I have to use no problem.
Got an item on media watch there did anyone notice that the Green Party was actually mentioned in the Guardian today?
No.
Quite a celebration.
Wow.
About two lines commenting on the Government's erm you know growing strategy.
Documents that they put out yesterday.
Mm the most we've had for months.
I know absolutely.
Wow.
First mention I've actually seen in months.
Do we put I wonder who  statement for that?
That's  not mine .
Right er well I think I've probably finished apologizing for what I did
write in the newsletter erm
Thank you for getting it out so quick Andy
No problem I'm sure.
In future I'll try both to get the dates that are supposed to be in in there and get the copy into my mouth rather than my compatriots.
Okay do we have any other matters arising from the minutes?
Because I do.
I've decided that this isn't any other business at all.
I've got a picture of Hugh.
Have you?
Yeah I've got a picture of Hugh with one end of a decontaminate  poster.
Yeah.
Because er he was down there er trying to dip his nose in the toxic chemicals.

"They, they had a documentary on Metros apparently and the Me they said that Metros of a certain period for about, I think  from his period sort of  A registration, B registration, Y registration  they're absolute rubbish apparently."
Yeah.
"You know, all the rusting and everything, they've improved now."
"The Me if he had a Metro now he'd, you'd get a better deal but they said that"
They're cheap though aren't they?
Well yes but not cheap if you have to keep replacing them and
Think he'll probably buy a new car  probably.
photographic  photo service.
How do you spell sergeant?
I've always wondered that.
Is that how you act is that sergeant?
Erm  yes.
It's not S A R?
Er  I think the American version is and I think that's the English version and that's right.
So his name is actually somebody sergeant?
Yeah.
"Ooh I wouldn't mind buying that, look."
"For sale, doesn't say a price though, but look, doesn't half look new doesn't it?"
Where?
Complete new Opel body I reckon he's got there.

Nice.
Genesis.
Who's that?
Oh that's Phil Collins isn't it.

And yet  two or three years ago it used to stop up there.
"Now you stop further, now you're almost stopping on the lights."
You put the word the carrier?
I just put carrier cos
"We , I understand what you're saying because yo , that's what it's used erm"
"I'm looking, I'm from sort of like"
in the conditions.
a legal point of view.
Yeah.
I understand what you mean.
"Danny's point is valid there because when you're reading a legal document, T, the T N T Express U K will hereafter be known as the carrier"
Carrier.
"he's put, so we wrote"
So really that's saying the title
"Yeah, the legal"
actually.
title it does say.
"But I was just gonna say, it's understandable"
Mm.
him thinking in terms and conditions of carriage.
Yeah.
"Yo , you wouldn't have just put the carrier normally would you?"
"That's what I'm saying, so  er, just er interpretation of the question slightly misleading there."
Right.
No worries.
What is a definition of a consignment?
"Now if you get these right, word for word  you'll be er, I do conditions of carriage quizzes on selling skills courses  and the amount of people that get this right I can count on one hand in the last three years."
Who got it right?
David.
Word for word?
What was the bit you did?
"Not word for word, now"
"What did he say, please?"
"He said, one or more items to one address."
No.
Mess around with your make up.
So I can get loads of homework done  and erm  like I can count that as one of my nights in.

It was her at the helm
"Ooh well this is what it beca , it did"
And
"and th the so called democratic, you know, choice of all these poli , all these MP's and what not which would comprise  parliament and government and head of the Tory party at the time  you know i it really  their voices on the, on the  the cabinet  you know, they were, they were just destroyed!"

Is covered by part D two stroke one.
Right.
Thank you Dennis.
You're a
good lad.
Right.
Could I just quickly look through here?
"I, I did have a go through this core brief to see if there were any things that I should have picked out."
"There there is a good section, there's a good section on pensions"
by the way because our staff will be concerned about pension proposals after privatization.
Is it?
It's section one point five.
If you view files three to five.
The main message I would give is that
"the Board has responded to the government with regard to the pensions issue, and suggested a number of improvements to the government's proposals."
Where?
I have done I've
"Let me see then, round your kneecaps?"
"No I have, I have lost it, I tell you what, now listen"

"had been a, a mark going around that, right  and that's what"
"I have lost it though, I have"
"There are, don't tip that over the cloth then"
"Alright then, come on then  you know I forgot I didn't have me keys with me this morning, of course the first one"

"You see even from Leeds North West  the outside party job and the P T pay monthly, so it's important that the client knows what he's gonna be facing."
But what we do is we estimate three months
Mm.
and divide by three.
Yeah.
"Then you get an average,"
Not bad.
"you know, and that's, that's the way"
What's that mean?
Mm?
No.
I think's it's quite generous
Don't be mean .

Next one Den.
Well.
There aren't any more.
Ther there have been quite a few that have come out recently which I haven't briefed.
Some of them are fairly minor and it's  to read them.
"Others which are perhaps a little bit of er a change from what we've been used to doing,"
Mm.
are currently being revised yet again.
So I'll pick them up at the next brief.
Right.
I think an hour of this is about enough isn't it?
Den that was great.
I mean I know there's been a lot of debate and I know that er you may feel it's been a bit of a waste of time
but  the fact that there's been so much debate
"If, if, if you say, Mary had a little lamb"

"Yeah, he's doing it."
Yes  yes.
We are struggling with judges aren't we?
"And what about, you know  about the judges, don't you?"
"Yes, but it doesn't"
"I just mentioned it er  we have we have had a suggestion from B class judges    that er  that the B class judges can show at er  an, an open show  providing, providing they declare beforehand"
Providing they declare their interests
"it is what I've always thought for a long time that  somebody like Brian   if he's not  if he's not showing at our fish  at our show, even as an A class judge, I, I  fail to see why he can't  judge at our show  it's, he goes to Skelm and, and judges there and our fish will be there or    strange really when we're struggling for judges that, that we don't do these things."
"Yeah, but we're looking at the financial side, aren't we really?"
W with Brian
"Well I know  I mean it  we're struggling to get judges, aren't we, and it's not going to get any better, it's going"
No.
"to get worse if anything, not better  the way things are going."
We're obviously  obviously  thinking along these lines
Is there?
"He, he was   apparently  and then  on the Saturday or Sunday h h he, he  started to reject so he had to go back in."
Oh.
Yeah.
Where did he used to live?
Yes.
Where was he from?
"So all, all the A class judges are getting a little bit long in the tooth now"
No more questions?
"No one, no more questions?"
I'd like er  to thank Alan  for being involved  erm  a proposer and seconder?
Proposed by  Steve   seconded by
Right er   please  can we have your report please.
Is it going in The Post?
No.
Didn't we tell you that?
"To have it in er  Daily Post, The Post is the morning one  The Echo's the evening  to have it in for one day in The Post and The Echo, how much?"
"Dunno, about eighty quid."
Three hundred and ninety six pound sixty four pence.
So you said we'll have it in all week?
How big was the advert?
Er about a hundred words in a box.
Two columns wide and  erm eight centimetres down.
We reckoned that was about quarter of a page.
It's a lot of money isn't it?
But see  the reason  I have to send this to Liverpool for them to put it in
Mhm.
cos it has to go through our advertising agents.
Cos we advertise in a special format don't we?
We have the  dash lines round the box
Mm.
and we have the logo on the bottom and that.
So they've had to do it so  I mean she quoted me
thirty six quid for this  thirty six eighty four or something for the local paper.
But erm  you know it might be more but that's
Mhm.
nothing to do with me.
But I mean like  I didn't think it was worth putting it in The Post to start off with anyway.
But if we don't get a good response to this I might stick it in for the day  in The Post.
Mhm.
Is the secretary at  dealing with it or is she gonna forward it all on to you?
No I've put our address.
I said that I didn't like that idea to start off with
No well it
because although it's only a small concern she's gonna have her own stuff to do.
"Right, so that's the temporary staff."
Yep.
"So what we haven't made any progress on  beyond, on that side of things is erm  if we do the coding over in Caernarvon, where that will be."
Yeah.
Erm like I think we all sort of ruled out er
I don't think it's big enough is it?
"Because of the size, no."
Er just out of interest I did ring  the other day
Yeah right.
"Er  the  the room, the smallest room they have is for twenty five to thirty people"
Mm.
which I mean even that may be too big for what we want.
Erm in any case that is in use every week on a Monday and a Wednesday.
So already you're only talking
There was a thing about exams.
Wasn't it  didn't you ring them up and they said we have exams on or something?
No.
That must be something
Something goes on in that room on a Monday and a Wednesday.
Which room is that?
"That's  the, I've got it in the file, a small conference room or something like that, or the committee room or something it's called."
Cos there is a room called the navigation room.
No that wasn't an  that wasn't an option.
There was this one for twenty five to thirty people and then there was another one for say forty or fifty and then it  zoomed up to like a hundred.
And even if we were to use this
"Oh I know now, yes."
"small room, you couldn't leave anything on the walls so it would all be a  come down at night, back up in the morning"
What erm er did you look in the file and see what they hired last time?
Erm  no.
Cos it may
I mean I've probably seen it
Yeah.
Oh
"I rang them up, it's, it's Bolton, but they don't do"
"wax, they do all the other waxes"
Bury isn't it?
Well I'd try Time and
Bury the one?
"They caught , I don't, yeah actually"
the address I had
Yes.
"Oh well I'll, I'll look, I'll ring I didn't actually ring"
I'll find out anyway
them up and ask them
"and actually you know this Time Chemicals, they, they deliver you know, they come here with the stuff."
Do they?
"Just ring them up, oh yeah, they go anywhere."
What is the recipe I
"Bury ,, Bury"
Mm
"That's a good one isn't it, dear me, that's er"
"Oh no, but, they, they will post it"
"Post it, but then they're gonna charge aren't they?"
Oh yeah
VAT and for a small amount it's not worth it really
One of the dogs gone down there?
I am sick and tired of picking up the mud
Hello Ken
"Oh, we're trying to see if any pick up the nails in the wall, you know"
"those boards trying to get them split down you see to make some, you know, shelves and that"
"No, not really"
Does it work?
It's got the battery in it
Well I'm not sure really it didn't seem to go to good on the cast iron nails you know the long ones
Paul  spikes.
Excuse me!
You took them and I want the batteries for them.
Some people go round
You asked me for them.
in science books
Excuse me !
What does it say?
Fourteen and a half.
Were they marked?
No  look at this here.
Don't like the smell of your Narcissus.
Well go and  won't they.
Don't like the smell.
Somebody look!
Can you see it?
Let's go  .
Oh well neat!
"You know I can't see from that distance  I thought John had a snowman badge on today, when I got close it's an owl and it said I am the vet."
He enters into th the to the fray doesn't he with it er
No he's got a grey jumper with an owl  Beaky  on it  all over the front  and a mortar board on the owl.
Did they have to ask him to do that or did he just volunteer.
"Oh probably just did it  Do you know what Terry's   do you know what one of my children did today?do you know what  did  apart from the fact he spent all day crying  then he had to do the corrections, I said go back and do your corrections, said right  on your own  I wrote something that went no homework done, so he wrote no homework done,no homework done, no homework done !"
Oh no! er!
I can just scream !
Ah  spent all day weeping today  with one thing and another when he weeps
Why cos you keep telling him off?
he oh!
"They'd write a poem for her about my greatest fear, I said I remember last year there was a boy called Ali and he wrote a story about   a poem about this bird and cos he was really scared of that and so I said I don't suppose any of you will write about being scared of me  except perhaps Adine!"
Eh.
All Americans go Eh    Nine o'clock tomorrow I'm going over to  Kate  ten thirty that gives me a bit of lee-way  I've got a  at ten I thought it was ten thirty  I ought to get some money out really  You're not going into Woking tomorrow morning  are you doing your quiz?
"Do you want some help with it, not really."
"Thanks to Ann Mobbs and to Theresa Smith, to Brenda Thornton and to Barbara Bryan."
"That's it from me, Bill Heine."
Thanks for joining us.
Goodbye.
Kelly.
You are once again doing it completely and utterly wrong.
at the wrong place again.
Kelly you have been using
"Kelly, you've done it again."
"Can you walk the right way, no, now do it right Kelly."
Let's see you actually do something for a change..
How do you do this one down here?
You should have.
What else have you been doing wrong Kelly?
. You've been using a brush instead of a spatula for spreading glue.
The spatula .
Right.
Now  I hope that  only Kelly has been doing things as desperately wrong  as Kelly has been doing them.
Looking around at all the  there are a whole lot of people who have left the same even border all the way round instead of having an even border top and sides and leaving a bigger border at the bottom.
Which you'll remember you were told to do so that there's a space For your name.
Sarah stand up and come over here.
"Sam, will you stop doing that please my love and come across here so that you two don't ."
I'm using a white colour pencil here  in order to  draw a line from  to the work that is being mounted on here.
And you might say that the word has not been mounted on there.
No it hasn't because we .
Can you see what I'm doing without me having to ?
Or are you baffled by what you see?
?
Mm?
No.
"it's a demonstration and the, the line itself  is like framed within a frame."
And the they'll turn a week about.
"But the the there's not the call in this er place for, for women in the weaving department."
Mhm.
"But our department hasn't changed, the women are just doing the same job as they did sixty"
Mhm.
years ago.
And probably in the picking as well.
In the winding it's just  their lot hasn't changed a great deal.
"Mhm, mhm."
Except I would say the winders are  worse off cos they're doing three shifts .
"Right, mhm."
And I just couldn't hack that I don't think.
Aha.
Mm.
"So, erm have you got, do you have a lot of friends through work do you find, I mean do you sort of organize things after work, do you ever go for a drink ?"
"Well a lot, a lot of people er er do er ju just about three weeks ago two women from our department retired so we had er we had a night out up in , that's where they live, so there is that kind of thing,"
Aha.
"or if on the few occasions that someone gets married, they hold a night."
", aha."
Er and some of the girls do like make-up parties and things like that.
Some
Mhm.
of them go to the weight training at .
Mhm.
"But as I say I don't do that kind of thing, I, I prefer to go away to the hills,"
"Aha, are you a keen climber?"
"and, and do my thing."
Mhm.
My daughter thinks I'm mad.
"When it came to my fortieth birthday she said, what would you like for your birthday?"
"I said, I'd like a really good pair of trainers."
"And I'm no good at tying laces so she got me a pair of Adidas you know with the velcro,"
Erm minus infinity.
"So, it's minus infinity or plus infinity."
When X is very large or very very small.
at minus a million.
Erm
What would that approximate to?
A million plus six.
No
"Do you  enter a big competition, and you could win a million pounds plus six."
"Compared to the million pounds nobody bothers much about the six, so"
Just a
"when it gets very large, Y is roughly equal to X squared."
"So if you know the graph of Y equals X squared which unfortunately I can't draw tonight it's  draw it for you, could draw it from the inside  keep telling everyone else."
Right.
"Now, there's a Y equals X squared."
Yeah.
"So around here, round this bit,there won't be any difference."
Hmm.
"Around  six plus six, let's say plus six in there."
"For, for some length, that'll be sort of almost flat, won't it?"
I mean
Mm.
"till we get to X equals a one and it starts making a bit of difference, so it'll probably go like this."
"Okay, so a lot of it, that's a very important, those are sort of very important parts of the graph."
Tend to
Mm.
get neglected.
People say oh I'll take it from minus five to plus five.
Right?
If we had something like Y equals erm X minus ten.
Right.
"Times  X minus erm or times ten minus X  like that, okay."
"No, I can't see the argument!"
"Well, to me you shouldn't have twenty five kids anyway!"
Well that's dictatorship
"Because because it, I would have a dictatorship on that!"
"I mean that's, I would have"
"Well that's, alright well  well that's"
"control of the world population, I se"
I would limit to two children.
"I would er, have control of the"
That's another argument!
world population.
Well fair enough!
But
Yeah.
that is another argument!
"It is, we're on the road ."
"That is er, that would mu , that would be my first priority."
Oh !
I thought your first one was everyone getting
I'm not go
the same pay!
"Yes, so everybody"
So
would need the same pay.
"But no matter what you'd, you know at the end of the week or the year or whatever"
"No, but I mean  I mean"
"there's all those people who have the same pay, that at the end of the year they would end up with different amounts  because people would manage money differently"
Differently
some would spend it
Of course they would!
as soon as they get it
Oh yeah.
Ten o'clock!
Oh hang on I'm leaving at ten cos I want to be there a little early  and start them but I hope to get some perks.
Nine okay?
Wake up at nine?
Yeah I'm going to Waitrose at nine.
So which fair is this  at school is it?
"Yeah, what do you think I'm talking about!"
"Oh I don't know I heard it's a craft fair, that's all I heard."
All this time Daddy thinks it's a like
No I said it's a  lovely craft fair.
It's called Christmas fair but you and Darren have got a stall so  ah
Why did you know what to do there then?
I already bought a children's  thirty five pee each.
Yeah.
Zoe  said  are they for your little   said which little fun are you talking about Zoe?
Said yes they're both for Paul ha ha!
Little   Look at those brilliant grafts Mum  double grafts they're called  Hobart and Darwin.
Why are they called double grafts?
They're not called double they've sort of got a  about rainfall and temperature.
"Oh and they show two things  so y you'll have to see if there's any correlation between the two  is there any correlation between rainfall and temperature, and is there?"
When rainfall goes up does temperature up and vice versa?
Dunno just gotta describe them.
"Well that's what you have to say, is there any correlation between"
What does correlation mean?
They all correlate.
Yeah.
It's connection isn't it Kev?
Mm.
Yeah  and you've gotta see
"That's level six, you should be doing that."
What's level six?
"Well correlation I've just done that with all my children, you should be level six, no good doing it, you should be it  Want you to do two pieces of work for Monday and  all the same level, so there's an extra  two you've got to do."
That's right.
I think you did send this is  intending it to be a postal application  Mr ?
"I did, yes."
"But er, your worships  to do it by your colleagues until today  because er  Mr   indicate on the  application form  that er  he will not be  in fact, operating the bar himself but it would be somebody else."
"In fact they, your colleagues wanted more information about"
Yeah that's a
Who will be operating bar Mr ?
Well  I'm I'm on er Mr Martin .
Actually I did  operations between the village hall and the Crosskeys and Mr Martin  is on the  pub for the last sixteen years you see.
Well that concerns this this gentleman to extend the licensing.
"Oh yes sir, definitely."
I'll I'll be going to the village hall  but I me I have to
"The Crosskeys that's why I put Martin , perhaps I've put the wrong thing on you see."
I'll be in charge of the bar actually.
So physically you will be exercising something degree of supervision in the
"Oh that, yes!"
Will you be there when it's time to close Mr ?
"I will, yes."
You see there   in particular to young people.
You are aware of that?
"Oh yes, that, that's why !"
Then this application be granted.
"Right, thank you very much."
Thank you.
Er
"Thank you, thank you very much."
"Application number fifty four your worships, the  a temporary authority in respect of Quick Save Supermarket."
.
Jacqueline  is the applicant your worship.
Are you representing ?
Right.
Could you take the oath please?
"Twice he became a tutor, but he neglected his work."
"In one case he had an affair with the mistress of the house, which led to his dismissal."
"He had a period as a railway clerk at  Bridge, but was dismissed because of a deficit of eleven pounds."
"As Barbara and Gareth Lloyd-Evans say, it's impossible to know how the money disappeared."
"Embezzlement forgetfulness, inefficiency."
Did Branwell grow up.
He promised to much.
He was his own worst enemy.
"Like the prodigal son, he wasted his substance in riotous living."
"Er, it's a bit of back background then about Branwell."
You know anything about Branwell.
isn't it.
Mhm.
"Erm, that his father didn't make him go to school."
Mm
"Er, there's a suggestion that he had mild epilepsy, and they tried to keep it quite, and his father tutored him at home."
So he didn't have a normal life a boy of his circumstances in those days.
"Would have, yes."
"It was more lonely, there weren't other boys around him."
Mm.
Mm.
"There weren't other people around him, except his family."
"Yeah, So,"
Didn't help an unstable character.
"That may have contributed, yes, yes."
yeah.
Any other
Plus the rather powerful father figure.
Mm.
Mm.
Yes.
Which tend to
Yeah.
"Oh yeah fifty, sixty pounds."
And how long would it last them?
About the same time as us?
Yeah.
I suppose you have to be able to afford all that if you can afford the car in the first place.
Right.
Yeah if you have to moan about that you shouldn't be driving it in the first place.
"Motto, what?"
"Motto of the story is er  er don't, don't buy expensive cars if you're gonna want to run the thing though."
You've spent all your money on this car.
All of a sudden you realize
"Well like that new advert for the Rover he says don't, I keep thinking my back  my back tailgate's  flapping or  I keep hearing, you keep hearing creaking don't you?"
"A creak here and you think what's that, what's this, what's that?"
"So that new Rover has been built so everything fits perfectly, right?"
So nothing rattles.
What do you mean nothing?
No toleran er the tolerance is you know minimal.
Whereas the tolerance here'd be  I dunno eighth of an inch here eighth of an inch there he says  the advert says as soon as you have tolerances like that then thing work loose and start rattling and creaking and
E E.
you can hear it go E E er E.
Yeah.
"you imagine cruising in a car, lovely car like that  and it makes no noise."
"Just cruising away and it just like glides, and you glide you know  like, like Papa's Citroen type  that kind of suspension."
Yeah.
Is this a new Rover?
Crikey what was that?
A Rover.
Was it that Rover?
Yeah.
"Was this a new, is this a new Rover ?"
Carving everybody up.
"You know, he'll come running  glasses."
Yeah.
I can't do it.
"And right, he made me heart jump, 'cos he looked just like your dad, and then a few days later, he's in garage again, and Johnny come in and he said, God he said, he gave me a flaming heart attack out there."
"I said, why, and he said, he turned round with these glasses on, then he said it was just like John's stood there."
"I says, don't tell me, I said, he did the same thing to me the other day, and it were only within a couple of days of each other."
"When he puts those glasses on, honestly he's his double."
"I think it's the way he looks, like, if you know what I mean, you know like  pull his face and like, look over glasses, I mean,he did it to me when  did it to Johnny."
He probably thought  like.
"He's like me dad, er me dad, he never had no patience, and our Colin's just like him."
"Mind you, I'm like our Colin as well in a lot of ways."
I haven't got a lot of patience.
"But where  where we're better off 'cos Albert, he's calm, where you and our Colin are both fiery tempered"
Yeah.
"Where, when I start, Albert's"
"He, I tell you want he doesn't do, I shouldn't let you hear, but, when he, when him and me are arguing when we were younger, and me dad used to wind Colin up, and wind me up, and I'd get madder and madder, and me dad used to love it."
"But looking back, you know, and now, that's what Colin does to me, he winds me bloody up,but I can't help it, because he gets me that wild, I should just, I should, I mean, how can you change his temperament."
"I mean, I should just turn round and tell him where to go, but."
I think Colin winds you up summat chronic
I know.
And instead of just
Ignoring him.
Ignoring him.
"You don't, he  and he  going through bloody"
"Yeah, I know."
What
A  where
No.
Bird pooh on window.
"But,I mean, er,"
Where the birds have poohed on me window flying past.
Oh God.
Yes.
Bring that ball here!
You got no bloody chance!
"But as I say, people believe everything, it's gospel!"
And you never hear the Labour party criticising.
"You know, but they should be  criticised out of hand what's going on in this country but they bloody don't!"
Well when when  if if the Labour party criticised  and they do criticise
"Oh they criticise Ken, yeah."
"The only time that you will hear about it is whe , if you have the television on  and you see it happening on the parliament  and on your papers."
Well you read your paper don't you?
And we get a middle of the road one which is the Observer
We we'll watch
"which is, they get some  they do some pretty good"
"But how often do the  I mean, they  they don't give you  they don't give you every detail that's gone on all week!"
Oh no they're  or there's certain ar
they only pick
a certain subject or
Yes.
whatever that's been thrashed.
"As you say , we'll see."
Well  he's gone on  seven days of the week  complaining about so and so  we'll just narrow that down to one article about his  his complaint that they may just make a little note  he's complained seven times about this!
So you see a little article
That's right.
he's not complaining!
"Yeah, but I mean basic things Ken, we'll take for example"
the low wages
Yeah.
"we, we haven't got one now, they got one in Germany, they got one in France  I in"
Yes.
Italy.
Well yes.
"Oh there we go, that was mistake number one  George dear have you read the er holiday page at all?"
"Inflammable, ain't it."
"Anyway, er, the bloke who managed to get him insurance, this this, the premises are insured with him,"
Yeah.
"so I thought, well, if he's already got, er, part of his insurance without having"
"Yeah, because he was in, paper, waste paper, and the fire insurance on that must have been colossal."
That's where  cardboard and paper.
Yeah.
"Sasha come in here, shut door."
He's not coming in.
"But er, I can't understand why, because I mean, let's face it,he he's only using fibre-glass and they're not that flammable"
"No, what they're saying is."
"Not the flammable, it's the er indemnity, nobody can breathing it in who's in"
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"They're frightened like, in years to come, like, they're gonna try and make a claim against them 'cos their er, been on the chest, is summat like that."
Yeah.
"I, it's health and safety, yeah."
er.
"Through the health and safety, but."
Eighty four we had this extension put up.
Yeah.
Sasha come in here.
"But, after saying that,"
There's a draught in
"what you gotta do, is make up your mind, what chemicals you're gonna use"
Yeah.
and then find out all about
What ya got?
Don't know.
"them particular chemicals and then submit it to the, the insurance company, what them's the only chemicals you use, and the company said this and that."
they told him that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"and er, he's got to do the drinks."
"Oh, that's good, isn't it?"
"So he gets twenty five pound for the for the night, and he hasn't got to start until about nine o'clock anyway   so erm that's, that's something for him to do, isn't it?"
"Oh, that's really good."
Yep.
"erm, Jay's sister, Tamsin it's her twenty first on Monday, so he was, like, write out her birthday card, right, and he was like, trying to write something funny, so he was constructing this thing, like reading it out to me, and  half an hour when I first got there."
Yeah.
"And er, it was very amusing, but repeatable, half the things he wrote in it, and erm, it's very, it was very good, but, he is quite good at that when he sets his mind to it, it usually takes him about three days to do it, but he does like to er, write messages in people's cards."
And er
"He's a laugh, your brother."
"He's a nut-case.  up to him  seems a  it's Mark, I couldn't believe it."
"It was like, get on to those bloody phone people, he said, I was on the phone to them for half an hour, yesterday, he said  haven't turned up, he said, and I organized m I work around  and everything."
"He said, and then I got you to come along, he said, and it's all for nothing."
"It's always the bloody way, innit?"
"And I said, well go and pick the phone up  Oh, yes, we have got a phone, actually"
Before you start whacking your breasts.
Mm.
I haven't had a phone all week.
"Which it isn't the easiest thing, when you've just moved into a place, is it?"
No.
"I mean, erm, you know, at least we're all sort of easy walking distance of one another."
"Like we council with our daily contacts through college, but"
That's true.
"like, you know, everyone's far away from them."
"Exactly, they"
"Quite a distance, haven't they?especially for emergencies."
"It's worrying,"
Mm.
isn't it to think that
Yeah.
someone can't get hold of you.
The acceleration there is say forwards.
One two
"And for every one second, you're going forty metres per second."
So you're going at a steady speed.
Per second.
"It's, it's a, it's an acceleration, it's metres second to the minus two."
"Now are you happy with that, because most people aren't?"
Okay.
"We'll come back to that in a minute, but  let's say  a rocket, or a car, which would you prefer that do?"
Car.
Car.
Constant acceleration car.
"Erm  no frictional resis resistance, you just put your foot down and it's, you know where a car accelerates from rest"
Mm.
and then after a while the acceleration reduces?
"The speed is still going up, the acceleration, and eventually it reaches a top speed and it stays there."
Mm.
"Okay, it's zero acceleration, it's not getting any faster."
Mm.
Erm  how would we measure that?
A constant acceleration.
Say we had an accelerometer.
An acceleration measurer.
Mm.
"Which  force on a weight or something  can feel acceleration, I think you can, my son said you can't but I think you can"
"So, acceleration is a constant."
What's your eventual top speed?
"It just, just keeps going faster and faster and faster and faster"
Infinity.
"Infinity, speed of light, when you hit something."
It's pretty high.
Mm.
I've been to that house
"and I've I've phoned three or four times  and you can get no reply  and I'm, I'm a bit cheesed off with it  cos this is the second time"
small claims court.
For want of a better word they're actually stolen   books are stolen.
"I'll get it  I'll get it back, I know where he lives."
Do you?
I mean
"Yes I've phoned and I've written three times  and I've written to his mother  our official letter, official no headed notepaper  she's not there, she works as a nurse doesn't she?"
She's not in till nine o' clock.
"Well they  anyway, were they?"
They were
"order it specially  cos it's not a book you'd ask for often, is it I suppose."
"Yes I know er yes I er er I er er I, I think it's a good thing  that people, if they ask for information, you've got to buy books to get them."
But what's aggrieved me is that he's just waltzed off with it  and not
It looks like he just  and come here just to get a book.
"I'll ask him  and he's, he's just ignoring all the er"
That's right  a letter that we're taking him to court
I know there's a couple
Erm
yes.
What was his name?
Alan .
"Okay, a course on presentation skills."
How many have been on a on a  training course before?
I know  has so several of you have already been on a  training course so you'll know the sort of er way in which we work and the way things happen.
erm let me just let me just ask you first of all what  is the value for you and for the company of of developing skills on presentations.
What's the value?
Respective clients
"Indeed, indeed so that's what you might use, yep  What's the value, I mean what does it do what does it do for the company first of all?"
Promotes it
"Promotes it, so it's about image isn't it?"
So  he's seventy eight now  she's probably about the same I think.
Mm.
But they had a Mini before the Metro and er  the day they bought the Mini they saw an advert in the paper saying that if you buy a Mini in the next few days
give you a free colour portable with it.
Oh.
"Of course they didn't get the portable with this, they rang them up, said where's my colour portable    said I'll put you on to the manager  anyway  they had some deal that night that erm to launch this Mini Mayfair or whatever it was  wine and cheese thing  so he went to the wine and cheese thing  and  worried he was gonna kick up a fuss  so they gave him a telly anyway ."
yeah.
"He's a penny pinching old bugger he is, god!"
I can't quite imagine
No.
coming back in a minute.
Yeah   What about ?
"The dust wagon came up to the warehouse today, the usual   they'd got halfway to emptying the first dustbin in the back"
Oh yeah.
and the hydraulic hose on the back of the dustcart broke  there was hydraulic fluid all over the
all over the car park.
So the driver said can I use your phone?
He came in  and trampling this brake fluid all over the carpet.
He got through to the  base camp to find out when the  chap was coming to fix it.
"Five minutes later he came in trying to tell  tell us jokes and each time he'd been paddling through this brake fluid and the carpet is just  you know, brains"
Mm.
Hand picked for the job I should think.
Well we didn't notice the footprints until he'd left.
Mm.
Yeah  of course once they get to know where you are
This is it
and you don't o do you open weekends?
You don't open Saturdays now?
"We don't, no."
No.
Are you going to?
No we don't.
I know they don't like it
"No, er, no especially with a band saw, cos"
Oh hello
"Hello Margaret, well"
"twenty years ago and, and, and they really had to"
and the whole band saw gotta to be resharpened he said and they go to a place in
Most of them don't do their own now do they?
No
"We used to have a shop you know, a saw doctor shop"
I
"when I had the time, did them all tension and set, you know, but erm, as you say now, they probably cost you about fifty pound a go every time they go away"
Yeah it's a
I don't fancy doing by hand
"Well, even that little one of mine"
"No I mean even with a hand saw, you know, I've done it before"
"You had to wait, wait about twenty eight before you went on top I believe I don't know"
"Yes, yes, oh yes"
"and er all his brothers ev , every one of them went, they served their time and"
"and er, it was er, the others were by having the lads and getting the trees down, er the extra wood that they got out of the er, out of the tree"
"they lost so many with, with the thickness of the blade"
"Oh I see, yes, yes, yeah, yeah"
"that's right, yeah"
I think
"bloody hell, that must of been hard work that, they must of been at it all day"
"Yeah, yeah"
"How did they keep, how did they stop the flaming thing from snaking them all, you know?"
I don't know
It must of had a good iron in it.
"Must of had terrific arms on them, oh dear me"
Yeah and I used to see them many a times in
"and what they'd leave them to what, then to, to dry wouldn't they at least?"
"Oh I, yeah"
I noticed they had some Philippine mahogany doors in  Do It All
Mm.
"on Saturday and yet, that you have to be careful because  they they have that I've forgotten what her name was on on Wogan saying next time you go into a D I Y store and you see a mahogany toilet seat  you know don't boy buy it think of the forest."
Well if you go into a D I Y store you'll find it's a mahogany stain  I don't know if they really make mahogany .
It would be very expensive
Yes you'd probably gauge by the price I would think.
Yeah.
Plastic
plastic.
plastic one.
Erm  oh
Yes actually  this cycle thing .
Cycle parking is actually  I wish they'd actually pay a bit more places to actually put your bike and you didn't have to sort of tie it up to some lamppost or something
"Yeah, yeah."
There's hardly anything
I mean they could give you a decent stand to put it in cos I hate those ones at Sainsbury's.
"Cos if you've got anything heavy in the bag, the bike falls over."
The ones at the library  as well.
Er and they ought to have a little shelter over it to stop your saddle getting wet  if it rains .
"I've got, I mean I've got my spots where I park it, I, it at Woolworth's and outside the post office  because it keeps it dry."
And out of the way.
All the roads into town are just awful.
"I mean the Dunmow Road, Hockerill"
Oh yeah.
You know  really scary.
You know you get asphyxiated with petrol fumes and then you get the danger of being  thrown off your bike.
cycling
Yeah  they squeeze you off the road if you go up that hill to Hockerill lights.
I
You must to  cat.
Just walk  slowly in the middle of the road.
So that there's no way they can take overtake on the right or on the left.
"Like, I really felt abused."
I mean at the time
Ya.
"I felt sorry for him but  I must admit when I got home and the following morning, and since then I've felt quite angry about it."
That's
The next
isn't it?
the next time you see the girls in the choir
I'll bet they'll turn round and say
"Well I, er, he ca , he was, he was then"
be careful of whatever his name is.
he was then saying erm  now what about a concert this Friday?
"Erm, there's such and such going on."
"And there's one er  a week on Saturday, you know, let's go to both of those and I said erm  I'm away those weekends."
"I said, I'm going away this weekend, I'm going away next weekend"
"Yeah, let's not."
and he said erm  have you got your diary with you?
And I said no.
"And he said, hadn't you better check?"
"And then he said, I don't mean to put pressure on, but I want to get to know you, we've got so much in common and erm  I want to take you out for dinner, not just go to the concert, but, we don't get to know each other that way."
"I'll come down to Richmond and take you out for dinner, how does that sound?"
"I said, I'll see you at choir."
But we don't get to see each other at the choir
"erm, because you don't stay back for a drink afterwards because you're going to Strawberry Hill."
"I know it'll be easier when you're in Fulham, blah, blah, blah, but erm  pressure!"
Pressure.
Pressure.
Pressure.
Crowding me in.
And then he said
"Then it's , it's better to have a two-timer from"
then he said I'm lonely.
"Having came to the  he was hungry, so he was glad to be h hired by a local farmer as a swine herd."
"Even the pods he was giving to the pigs, he would have liked to have eaten himself."
"He decided to go home, and offer to be a servant instead of a son."
"But his father was overjoyed to see him, and at once threw a party."
His elder brother coming home from the fields and hearing dancing enquired what was going on.
"When he heard the explanation, and that even the best calf had been killed, the fatted calf had been killed, to help the party he was furious."
And that is understandable.
"At this point, we are then asked to consider, does the elder brother become the family black sheep, is there a sort of change of position."
I don't know what
I wouldn't think so.
No.
a brother.
The story makes its point to the finish.
Mm.
Mm.
"So th they,yo yo you couldn't see a situation where the person who er was previously in disgrace, was no longer in disgrace, and the one, the the the brother, then showing je jealousy, was himself in disgrace."
Sounds like fiction.
Sounds like fiction.
"No, it's just the father's attitude that changed, not the way that"
Mm.
Mm.
"Well, he, he was repentant, he was only repentant because he was hungry."
"Yes, yes, yeah, yeah."
"Can you stop being a black sheep then, did did did he stop being a black sheep when he came back."
"Was that the end of the story, as Trevor was saying."
"Well, he certainly gave the father the opportunity to say, I told you so."
Mm.
Mm.
"Done, Yeah"
Mm.
Or he could say I was one
"I was one of the black sheep, but I'm no longer."
"I know erm  I thought I wrote to the electricity board in, I wrote to somebody  about erm how er things should be labelled about how efficient they are when using electricity."
You took part in the er electricity efficiency didn't you?
Yes.
"Yeah but didn't, we didn't write to our MPs though."
I thought we were
"supposed to write to somewhere else  was it  the department of the environment or  now what would it be, energy?"
"We wrote, wrote to them cos I've got a reply to that letter somewhere with a great wad of information"
about various fridges and
"Yeah, yeah"
and things.
Yeah
So I can't really say we've written to the MP can we?
We haven't found out about company car fleets have we?
We tried.
Well I tried and then I was let down by the group.
I don't remember anything about that one
We arranged it  two days or three days and each was cancelled
March ninety one?
. In March this year?
It was this year.
Last year.
Last year.
I didn't think we'd done anything about that this year.
But that was last year.
Yeah.
But we haven't done a march  ninety one then.
Scanned the local press for power station applications or authorizations  H M I P.
Written to Michael Heseltine about acid rain?
May ninety one.
Written to your MP to ask him her to press for strict E C standards for C O two emissions from vehicles May ninety one.
when was that?
Wasn't that on the talk?
Playing with me knobs.
Look hang on I've got one queu are you all right there Rachael?
Hello.
"Do you get fed up with people saying, Are you really like that one in Coronation Street?"
No I don't actually cos I'm  nothing like her .
Erm
You look similar.
Well that's er that's a insult.
It's not.
It is.
Yeah.
I thought when we did we did that programme out to lunch in the summer and you came along and we talked all about buses and er your organization and I I I was very nice to you actually.
You were very pleasant.
"And didn't say you know, It's flipping these tour buses in York that cos all the other people trouble because you can't get anywhere they clog the roads up."
Well that's really not our problem I mean that's to do with the deregularization of er bus companies allowing any anybody to start up a bus company.
Oh that's a bit political Rachael isn't it a bit political I wasn't expecting that
featured the last er three years some of the  other companies have only been here since last year and the year before so I mean we're a national tour operator
experienced in running open topped tours around cities.
Could you hang on just a minute don't go away just stay there hold on.
Ah Rita.
Yes James.
Good.
Sorry about that
Still here.
What?
I said I'm still here.
You had to go off and make his nosh didn't you?
No I didn't he's in the kitchen being a very very domesticated husby and he's making own nosh.
He's not is he?
Yeah he is oh heck I've got to get the news in haven't I that worries me.
Well don't worry if you ask him nicely he might even make you a bacon sandwich.
Would he?
any financial commitment.
And it doesn't change the contract.
So I mean
B t t
"The reason why, no, the reason why these, these"
but they do.
procedures were written is because in the past we had that foggy situation
Mm.
Mm.
"and I wanted to clarify that, and make sure that our procedures actually were back to back with contract procedure."
"So I think in terms o of this particular erm procedure, we're okay."
Mm.
"Where, where we're not okay is in the point that Jim has raised, the general point and that is, what do we mean, what do we d define as a project engineer?"
So junior junior R Es then will not issue V Os.
Unless they're delegated t to do so within the contract and I rely on you to make sure that whoever is delegated to issue
"What if they're,wh what if they're below M S two level?"
No no.
No R E will issue a V O.
They might do if they're M S two I mean  the project engineer
If it's the project engineer.
Yes.
Yeah.
Fine.
specifications here Trevor?
With regards to?
On one two or
Yeah.
three?does it use the word th the term
No.
project engineer?
Definitely
not in the erm er in the M S ones.
"Yeah, right."
"Right, is there anything else?"
"So, yeah there is."
Erm  things like whether I'm using my car and stuff I suppose I need to speak to Mike about?
I haven't done anything about that.
Right.
Erm
erm statutory undertakers?
Bus companies
Yes we'll need to write to all those and  we'll need to write  we need to write to the police
Yeah.
on  in two guises don't we?
Partly because we're doing a survey but partly to warn  partly because of the emergency services aspect.
Yeah.
"So we need to write to the police to er  I suppose the thing to do is we write in a general way to the, the Chief Constable, North Wales police"
Yeah.
which is I think in Colwyn Bay
Yeah it is.
"and  but when it comes to actually organising the police control of the survey sites, we, we speak to the erm  traffic inspector at wherever it is."
I'm not sure
Right so who did you say in Colwyn Bay?
What what
Just write to the Chief Constable.
I think we need to write three letters.
"One to the police, one to the ambulance, one to the fire brigade  just saying  we're proposing to do them."
Obviously that'll have to be when we've fixed the sites
Yeah.
and the dates are on.
Yeah we'll do this
But that's normal.
"general letter to the police saying that we're intending to do these surveys, just putting them in the picture and put a note in that erm  once, you know, dates and whatever, you know, we'll give you further details as and when we know"
"Well I wouldn't, I don't think I'd worry about writing to them until we've got the dates."
okay
"Hey bud, where you going?"
I was supposed to be going home
"Example a thousand pound  normally two and forty eight pounds, now only forty eight pounds"
What?
D'you think it's the wheel of fortune?
"Well it says it is, it's been"
It's a whole page spread  from such an established reputable company.
"All prices are fully inclusive of double glazing, grade one security p v c delivered ."
I don't know.
It doesn't say anywhere there's a guarantee  .
Cheshire.
I wonder if it's the same address as when we got ours?
Well we should have guarantee somewhere in the box there
"I mean it's it's, how long is it since it was supposed to have gone bust?"
Well it's years since I thought it had gone bust
I thought it was about ten years
Wasn't there somebody from  who got
I can't remember.
"When we got that, when we had ours and er they said if you if you found someone else who would like who would have  you would get seventy five pounds back and you gave the thing, who was it who was thinking about it?"
Was it erm what did they call?
Isabel?
Isabel?
.
Wasn't it her?
"It might have been, I can't remember"
Wasn't it just before or after her husband died?
It's been that long I don't know.
Her husband died when we were .
It couldn't have been that.
No.
Well I phoned Shirley and she said she's fine.
Erm  the alchemist is conning people promising them that he'll turn base metals into gold.
"One of the people he's conning is Sir Epicure Manhom  who wants a life of ease and luxury and has been giving  the alchemist loads of money in order to tu to, to perfect this  and  funny enough the alchemist hasn't managed, hasn't managed to do this, to get the person's money."
Okay.
So that's who Epicure Manhom is.
"One day, when he is, somewhere back in act two, one day he is visiting the alchemist he catches sight of this woman, Doll, quite obviously a prostitute, probably an a an absolutely  erm  catches sight of her and says, I must quickly think up some reason why this woman is, is in the house  cos  Sir Epicure Manhom thinks the alchemist is a pure, homely  er priest-like creature yet in fact, he's running a whorehouse."
Okay?
"So,has it's worse than Neighbours ."
"Erm, think  erm  so he's sort of bluffing, okay?"
I'll just find a scene where he does this.
"Er er  in act two, scene three  okay?"
"Er erm  quite a long way, there's that, that line  erm  two twenty."
Okay?
"Face had just realized that Sir Epicure Manhom has  erm  seen Doll, which he shouldn't have done, and  Manhom calls Face out and says stay Lungs."
That's what Face is called at the moment.
I dare not Sir.
Say man what is she ?
Now Face is bluffing here.
A Lord's sister sir.
", pray thee stay ."
And he sort of bluffs a bit more.
She's mad sir .
"Still trying to explain why a Lord's sister is staying with the alchemist, okay?"
She's mad sir.
"Send hither, he'll be mad too."
"I warrant thee, why send hither?"
"Sir, to be cured ."
"You know, he's, he's thinking on his feet."
"He's trying to find reasons for this, this woman to be in the house."
"Meanwhile Sottle off stage is more, is calling why rascal?"
And Face  low you hear sir ?
He's going out to spend some .
Okay.
Do they need to do the  they've proposed that they  to bypass erm  if we're doing the Caernarvon bypass.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
Well it doesn't say that.
Well can they detrunk that bit?
responsibility not
Yeah.
theirs if they put the bypass in.
"So what came out of this, well it could be"
So are they looking to build a bypass first?
The gut reaction this morning is we could end up  with a bypass scheme at the end of it and no Caernarvon link.
Oh that's no good is it?
Of course it is.
Cos we're still continuing designing a Caernarvon link .
four percent fee .
"Mind you it's, it's a smaller job."
What's smaller?
"Well if they're doing that then we s we're looking to make this a dual carriageway  on the Richard  principle that if it's a trunk road it's worth building a dual, a dual carriageway."
If you can convince him on traffic grounds fair enough.
So they're serious
"Course the initial thing is we get some reaction back from this, this"
so they're seriously looking to  the trunk road network coming down  bypass and then going off round the Caernarvon bypass?
Or is that just
That wasn't er  Ray  's view.
That was this other guy's view.
Based on this other scheme really he said oh yes.
"But which,whi which other guy?"
This Ve Vernon whatever his name is.
The  are proposing this.
They won't want that.
They wo they won't
But the  the guy that's looking after the  schemes
Yeah.
Great stuff.
So what's the trick to the solo on there?
"I don't know like, some of it's just real hard, most of it's just easy anyway it goes in the big diddly diddly diddly bit at the end, just"
stuff's no problem but er once it starts  and get the medium stuff done as well
And there's the bit
so that when he gets up
"three of my frets on the bottom string that you can't bend up, I don't know what's wrong."
"And you hit it and it bends up and it just dies  and I've been sitting like, I mean I, I definitely don't think that it is anything with the way I hold it in like cos I've been sitting going  and I just, just hit it and it goes ee, it just dies so you can't bend, that's on  too."
Och it might be  I dunno  it might be with you bending it  that there's a bump on that string.
"Yeah on the, that's a thought,"
I think
Yeah.
But th it's something wrong with
It looks real good with
"That's what I thought, I thought you know fuck  looks like a bloody comic shop for a change."
That's why I stuck all the posters here   think the back issues  loosening up a bit it was getting pretty tight.
Nine hundred series.
"Well okay   Anyway I thought they'd ring here but  couple of people, some, two women   I thought it was Belfast Station"
New window display and everything.
The big guns and the big guns  I found a use for the fucking thing.
That looks good actually    I thought you'd be practising like mad  on your day off.
No.
I was playing last night   Gotta learn this  album I used to have ages and ages ago   fucking .
"I was really annoyed last night, I was getting really     There was all this like down tuning and up tuning like all over the place    That looks like Bart Simpson's dad"
Mm yeah.
got the hair
Probably
What is it?
Going to  tonight.
Are you?
I thought you'd given that up.
"No, back on again."
it's too much isn't it?
"But like erm  my mum was saying, you know  she's like  she's  got a, definitely got a good job and like, the kids really sort of"
"You get, are you alright?"
Comfortable?
Yeah.
"sh , he's really sort of like, dead brainy and goes to the child-minder and  goes to school and whatever!"
"But like erm  she said like, he's a really good kid."
Well
Mm.
"I mean  well I thought to myself, God what a life!"
"I mean, I know it's not her fault  but like, every Wednesday she has  all the people from the college bridge  go to her house to play bridge."
I mean the kid's
Poor kid!
just sat there on the sofa!
"I mean, okay, he goes to bed about, what, eight o'clock or whatever?"
"But like, I mean  God, do you know I'd really hate that!"
"I mean, I used to hate it with like  having  flipping  anyone come up to our house when I was little!"
Yeah.
"I remember, I remember once"
Apparently his mum's hardly there!
"Because  the baby-sitter she's got at the moment right  she said she doesn't mind doing  Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays  as well as the weekends  but she doesn't wanna do every day  each week."
"Ma , how much does she go out?"
"I mean, God, the poor kid I feel really sorry for him!"
Yeah!
I mean  ooh!
"That's why she's asked me to do it, but like I said to mum  you know, I'm not gonna say to her, oh yeah I'll do it whenever you want, I'll say like  they're gonna do this extra course on Wednesday nights  and she said, like  unless she could get a baby-sitter she couldn't go  which is the reason I'm doing it."
So like
Just say you'll do it Wednesday night.
"Yeah  say I can do it Wednesday nights, apart from that, you know  it's too bad sort of thing!"
"So I think I'm gonna change my nights  this, of staying in  to either Mo , Monday and Wednesday or  Tuesday and Wednesday  something like that."
I don't know really!
"But like, like erm  that'd be quite good because if I go to someone else 's house like, you don't wanna be sort of like, messing about with all, all the stuff, you haven't got anything to  mess about with, do your hair or whatever can you?"
"I told her off for not let not telling us she was ill and she said no, no I'm fine."
She's got her friend Sandy staying with her
When's Gareth back?
"He was he was in the house, I didn't speak to him though."
I just spoke to Shirley.
"Erm, Sandy's staying with her for a few days."
What else did she say?
Did you say about us going down or not?
"No, I didn't mention it, at the moment."
She's got Sandy staying now
"I asked her about the letter and she said she couldn't remember anything about it but she filled in something when they came back from Belfast and she said open it, so I opened it and it's one of these things er if you book to go to Dublin before May the whatever, the end of May, then if you went again in the Autumn, you you get er fifty pounds worth of vouchers or something, you go half price."
It's one of those con things like they tried
"Well,"
"Yes,wh why, I mean why would she go to Dublin"
Dublin
before.
What else?
And why Dublin when i when they were
When they crossed from
when they crossed from Northern Ireland?
I don't know.
Cos they're trying to sell things all the time.
"Anyway, she doesn't want it."
Martin still hasn't got his erm invalidity pension sorted out but he's managing alright at the moment.
He's filled in all the things.
I forgot er I haven't watched the television at all and I forgot to record what d'you call that thing? with the devil in it?
Well it was half way through when I came in
I forgot to I know I forgot to record it for you.
I think I'll go to bed early tonight
Does that rain mean it's off the coast or it's in our area?
And was that minus one just the Western side or us as well?
We'll get to know better with the local news after this
And I should imagine that the  light paper's the backing paper and that I've already glued my work on the   paper and my  my picture is already glued just there.
Can I have my sellotape back?
And I'm now drawing
Sorry.
a white line about half a centimetre from the edge of the  work being put on.
Right this is a  decorative line round the sides of .
Does that make sense?
Just a white line.
Now you can make that look even smarter by making a second white line on the outside.
And then moving the erm ruler slightly away from the border  for the second line  over the top of it which makes it thicker.
So you've got a thin white line on the inside and a thicker white line on the outside.
That's point one.
"Point two is this, that I made the bottom border there  er  about  be exactly five centimetres."
And I'm going to  put a guide line which is one erm er half  a centimetre from the side there .
"Yes Christine, can I help you?"
I've put two very  faint white lines there in white.
"You could use ordinary pencil, are you alright Bruce?"
Have you lost something?
Aye I was just
You then write your name in block capitals.
What's your name?
Jane?
J A Y N
?
Yeah.
"So imagine you were writing Jayne here  J  now it's a very long name, Jayne  and you have to put the title on there too, so I couldn't put it all in capital letters on this occasion could I?"
"Probably that was a little bit on the, the large side anyway so  I would use lower case as well on this one, a bit like, a bit like junior school writing."
Do you know what I mean?
Then it'll fit on very easily.
You have to use your common sense.
"But you can see how a white pencil on that paper, that's going to look quite smart."
"Without, without the picture."
Has Barney got little little legs
Mm.
a little bit bigger don't ya.
Look at that flaming dog.
"Come on, come on, throw them over there."
"I wonder if there's any way you can actually check, you know, where he is, is there any way that"
"Watch me tea, now."
"straight out, or,"
"Well, what what do you think erm,"
Are you worried about how much money it's gonna cost ya.
"No, because money's cost us less."
"Er, you know when they said we had to pay two hundred and fifty one for er, administration and search and survey."
"It's come back, and it's under two hundred."
"Can I have a cup of tea, please."
Then they said I've got to pay five hundred pounds for
"Do what, love."
I don't think Allied Dunbar will deal with anybody that's dodgy.
No.
"Er,"
"Now, watch that tea."
Yeah.
That's what he said.
Are you ready.
I don't think they'd deal with anybody that dodgy.
Er.
Bert.
"Are you doing alright, are ya."
"What they do, they look they look around and they weigh up up pros and cons up, and it it's like these insurance brokers, they ring all over to buy cheapest insurance for you, well, that's what Allied Dunbar are doing."
"Well, well, this is a broker, but it's a  broker, so that's"
Yeah.
"You see, what it is, it's where they've been behind with their mortgage, we will pay a slightly higher rate, but it's only"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Subtract them that way round.
They'll go out.
"And we've got three point one squared, minus"
Two point nine squared .
Two point nine squared .
Mm.
"Which will come to, if we add them it's six times nought point two."
The gradient will be one point two.
That's a bit better because a gradient of one is forty five degrees and we s we said it should be more than that.
Erm  one point two.
Find out which ang what angle has a tan of one point two.
Tan minus one .
One point two.
Fifty.
Fifty.
"So you were, you were closer to seventy."
"You see how hard it is to see just from the graph, from a, from"
Mm.
"a sketch, if you plotted it on paper, but this is without plotting it, we're getting it quite accurately."
"Erm  maybe someone says it could be useful for you to try it again, without any help from this page at all."
"So we've got Y equals X squared, minus one."
And we want the gradient at the point where X equals three.
"But we want to get very very close to it, like only nought point nought one before it and nought point nought one after it."
So what value would ?
Around the point where X is three.
Erm so you'd need  nought in the middle.
"No, I'm not thinking of drawing a sketch at the moment, we've done the sketch on the other page"
Ah.
"and we're just thinking of  what value are we going to, what would be the value of X point nought one before three?"
Er two point nine nine.
Okay.
"Oh well, according to that it's cloud."
"At least it's a white cloud, not a black one"
Did you see your mother?
"No but I get a message, will you tell my brother, no don't tell my brother, they said, she said to one of the nurses and they said, your brother?"
"No, my son."
I said well what did don't you have to tell me?
"She said, we're not gonna tell you."
So I didn't get to know what what they didn't have to tell
Oh.
What was she doing tonight?
I don't know
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
"Mostly dry, sunny spells"
Sally was quite intrigued by that
We'll have to get her a set of books.
"There's some bottles, jars, for the bottle bank as well"
"You know the last time you  the erm, the last time you missed the television pages, television supplement in the  out of the Mirror."
I don't think they believed me.
And it's erm it'll be twice in a month and Chris is back again as our paper boy.
The other one was so useless but according to the er that new manager in the paper shop everyone else got theirs.
So I said I'm sorry but I'm not included in everyone else and he gave me one.
The Radio Times?
Why?
Because it's got all the
Ah.
Are we staying up all Thursday night?
"Well, it's up to you ."
"Of course, well you could stay in bed all day on Friday  And I could take the kids to schools and go back"
"I need to go, I need to go into the Co-op and Iceland."
What shall I get for your mother?
I'll get some chocolate biscuits I think.
"You would think she would put on a lot of weight, wouldn't you?"
And did you
"So erm  I was feeling a bit edgy about this when we were in the pub after the concert cos I thought maybe he's  reading things into it and I, you know, I was just going along for the music."
"So I thought, oh maybe I'm  reading too much into it."
"So I met him on Wednesday evening  Tottenham Court Road tube station  and er  chat, chat, chat."
"He, he talked so much we missed our stop."
In a very loud voice!
Did you?
Yes.
"Erm, and he kept touching me as well which really annoyed me!"
Oh oh!
"Well, I'm a bit of toucher myself and I, I don't mind if it's friends or family or someone I'm keen on"
Oh yeah.
"that doesn't bother me, but considering it was only the second I'd spoken to him  and I did not fancy him in the least  erm, it really made my skin crawl."
"And erm  first couple of times I kind of didn't respond, and the next few times I was literally flinching"
Mm mm.
"and moving away, like, hint, hint."
"But he liked gripped me on the arm and then  his hand would appear from nowhere during the concert, he like kind of rubbed my arm and are you alright?"
. Oh it was just a nightmare!
"I, I know I'm a real bitch saying all this."
"But, you know  I think it, I thought it was his  dingy grey suit to begin with that smelt of moth balls but it, it was his breath."
"It was, I don't know how it smelt"
of moth balls.
"And he kept guffaw and going,"
and get this awful blast of moth balls !
Really?
"It was, it was a complete nightmare !"
Oh.
"And I, I wasn't prepared"
I wasn't prepared for   for it at all
Go on.
"because afterwards I, he had his arm round me when we were leaving  and said oh well, I've really enjoyed this evening, we'll do it again won't we?"
"And I pulled away and I said, well erm  I so enjoyed the Mozart I've always wanted to hear it."
And the bus left at a quarter past eight.
Hour and a quarter.
I could have travelled home.
Yeah.
Bloody hell.
"Honestly, it was just sitting there, we were just not moving."
"Well, you probably know what it's like, I was just sitting there."
"Is it, is your parking permit saying what college you're at?"
"Yeah, I have to."
"I'm not allowed to park in their colleges, other colleges."
See what I mean?
Yeah.
So I can't drive there
Said you can't get on the bus either .
No.
That's what I said.
"Well, the good thing is, where Southlands is, which is on the south  which is a very nice area."
"Well, it's not that nice, but there's a hell of a lot of little roads, all around it, it's not a like Roundtree is, is it?"
"It's just on a little main road, but it's situated almost in this housing estate."
"They must say, God they must get pissed off with it, so I've already looked around, and there's loads of parking places,"
Mm.
"there's no yellow lines, there's loads of little roads."
That's true.
"I mean, I could park it there, if Nicole didn't want to drive."
"But the, the bus, the erm  staggered."
"You got a bus at eight fifteen, and you got another bus at one o'clock, and you got another bus at three o'clock, and another bus at six"
You serious?
"and, and if you wanna come home, there's supposed to be a bus at half past four, and our lecture finished at quarter to four, so you like, three quarters of an hour to get to the bus, right, and then it didn't turn up."
"So we had to wait for the next bus, which was six o'clock."
Oh no.
It's a long time.
"We were sitting like this, sitting on the pavement, with our umbrellas up"
Oh!
in in a will or something
Yeah.
so they have the house and move into house
Then they pay a lot
but they're gonna taxed so heavily that they can't afford to live in it  under this new tax!
They've just gotta sell it!
I thought well  how  what a bloody shame!
Terrible isn't it?
"Mm  I mean er why don't they do it on like the square, how big your house is because that way you could  I know it's not far when  people who live in a great big old house  don't have to pay as much cos if this  I mean Uncle Trevor and Aunty  they've got a massive great house  haven't they?"
Have yeah.
But if this  because it's old or something they don't have to pay so much   the
the
rates
"The rates, yeah."
you know?
Yeah.
"But if you only went on the square foot it don't matter how big it was  well that's like, surely that'd be fairer?"
That's right  it wasn't
"Yeah but ah then again why I mean like a lot of people have  don't have actual  they haven't got money  but they they sort of choose to have money tied up in property ,though it don't mean to say you're wealthy just because you've got a big house does it?"
If
No.
"you've got no money  we haven't got any money  but, you know"
Doo doo doo doo
I mean why should I I
Why should you be condemned just because you've put your money into your house?
"Yeah that's right, I mean some people don't"
Alright fair enough they want you to buy your own property but now .
Yeah.
Oh!
And if you go a spend if you in if you've got a big house and you tend to spend thirty thousand pound on a new car you don't get taxed on that
Phone!
Not guilty.
"Also, that on the twenty first of June you've used the motor vehicle  at Worley on Accrington Road when there was no test certificate in force."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Not guilty.
"Also, that you failed to produce an insurance certificate on being required to do so."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
"And, finally that you failed to produce a test certificate."
Are you guilty or not guilty?
Guilty.
Has he produced these documents to you Miss ?
No sir.
Have you got the insurance with you?
Yes.
The test certificate with you?
Everything my solicitor  was outside.
What?
"I give them to that solicitor that, I were talking to."
Which duty solicitor?
His duty solicitor's
Oh!
Mr .
.
likely to receive custodial sentences.
in this instance.
I can't see any harm  .
Would you like me to show the the prosecuting solicitor?
Well perhaps it'll save time.
.
Mm?
Knowing business effects it.
No  take them off.
One girl nearly got knocked off going up Newtown Road.
It's really quite narrow as you're going up there.
What about the  all the cars all parked round corners everywhere like up at Havers.
Mm.
They could do something about that.
Have you every cycled up there?
"Not round Havers,wh they park where those, those sort of shops are  they they park all around the corners so that you have to go out round them."
And of course you meet something coming the other way  wrong side of the road.
Oh yeah.
What annoys me is that everybody parks on the pavement as well.
Mm.
Seem to disobey all laws there are about parking.
"It does, it doesn't really help us does it?"
Do you wanna pass  these around as well if anyone wants to look.
All the replies  got eleven or so replies that I've had for that questionnaire.
There are a few people  willing to help  aren't.
"But I  haven't gone really as I hoped cos I'd envisaged having the membership list with sort of names of who'll make cakes, who'll help on the stall and then know who to phone"
Yeah.
"when I wanted some help or  who to invite to meetings but  because I haven't got a reply from everyone  or most people, it can't work does it?"
Is that all the replies you got?
sent more than fifty out.
I did sixty and Caroline copied even more .
She's a good girl.
Did Georgina reply?
"Erm  did actually, yes."
"Yeah, cos when I phoned she said she's still quite interested."
Mm.
Yeah I thought she was
but she said if the baby .
And  I've got a local group summer questionnaire which I couldn't really fill in.
. Isn't it awful!
I thought I'm just as bad as you know everybody else really.
But I oh I used to go to the country dancing.
So was there a drama club going in  when you came here?
No.
That would be finished up?
"That was finished up, mhm."
"What about the  one, was it still going?"
When you came here?
"I don't think so, I can't remember  eh it going then."
Because I think it was Tommy that said it was really after the  one finished and there was nothing else round about that there was a gap of a few years and then you got started again here.
"Yes, but er it was actually Mike  that got it back up here,Mike  and Grace , John  's first wife that started it up."
"I can remember Leslie coming home, I think I must have been expecting Doreen at the time, that was in, that was early early on, nineteen, well that was nineteen sixty three, and he was, he had heard that had I had been in the Gatehouse Drama Club, and er he said, Would I be interested in com in coming to the Drama in  if they started?"
Leslie said he would need a special part for me then.
But that it took another oh quite a number of years really to get it started up.
They were very good for it's first
Oh the first concert oh yes
those kind of people.
The f I often find that really the first year it was more fun  and er then when they started on the plays and that it got more serious and
A bit more like hard work really?
"It was really, there wasn't so much fun in it, it was all more serious."
And when Bobby  was there it really was
I remember
Oh yes.
He and Andy  together were very good .
"Mhm, yes, oh they were, aha."
"Bobby was really, he just kept it going really."
Sometimes just one person like that or a couple of people ?
"It , it just needs a character really, just to keep it going."
And he really was a character.
"somehow in the drama, even though it's so long since he passed away ."
There's nobody can replace individual people .
"There no, no, nobody at all."
And do you think er the others feel that like you do about doing the plays that it's maybe a bit more of a strain you know the competitions and
He wants every single penny accounted for  before he starts doing anything.
But she's that  we
"He had er, fourteen and a half thousand pound once in a building society four year ago  there's nine hundred pound left in his bu er, building society account!"
They want to know where that is.
"She,"
"The solicitor, nobody else, just the solicitor."
Er  he's got some insurance policies  one's for eleven hundred pound  right?
And they're gonna pay that.
And that's gotta go straight direct to the solicitor.
"Also, he's supposed to have had an insurance policies  but General Accident said it's only for a year  and he took it out in seventy seven to nineteen seventy eight."
But he's still got the policy  life insurance on it.
He was insured with the Co-op.
He was insured with the Co-op.
Oh that were a  that'll be  bound to come.
So that's
I don't know.
"Yeah, he won't pay Mrs  insurance money out yet will he?"
"No, he, he, he, he's gotta pay it to the solicitor."
It all gotta go to them?
It's all got to go to solicitor.
And that  fourteen thousand five hundred pound every single penny's got to be accounted for.
Well who's gonna know about that then?
The bank.
Building society he put it in.
The solicitors who gave him the court order  for them to release all the details on that.
And even that car he bought  the
Who?
the solicitor can take it off him
The solicitor wants to know why
And he'd bought a car had he?
Yeah.
For a boy.
"I says well, at sixty you do a mile in a minute."
"So I said if it's only for a mile it's going to be well less than a minute at eighty, presuming you were doing more than   thereabouts and er that was it."
"But the car, he'd er he says oh that was funny he says, I blew past him, popped into fourth, I blew past him real easy going up the   ."
"Come out at Foxhalls at forty, I think he did."
"He can come through Foxhall like and he, he'd had to speed up he says and then  he says he didn't carry on, like."
He hadn't been doing  and er  reckon he  and er  think I'm  and that was it  so  right    Been driving since he was  nineteen
"two or three months ago, I think it was."
"I remember him saying once before I don't, I don't know what  and er he says it's only a fortnight ago since  you know ."
"You get done for, pulled up for speeding or parking or something and you can pay your own  fine ."
"So I went home, anybody gonna pay me fine?"
He says I am gonna cop it off me mother  cop it of his mother.
You're always going too fast!
I told you before!
"He says me dad al me dad was always speeding he, he used to go mad!"
Mm.
slow down.
"Yeah  obviously watching wasn't, wasn't watching his mirror very hard."
"He hadn't seen copper trying to get him caught up, I wonder how much he was using mirror when he was overtaking people?"
"Mm, yeah."
Whether he was just watching what was coming from the front.
Mm saw him coming  have to get it  cos Neil's mum was cross about it.
Oh well  he was only just finding out what the rules were.
There was a gang of us chatting with him.
I come up with six points.
That made his day.
He says have I got a fixed penalty?
I says only got a pink form if you've got a fixed penalty.
"Know somebody who got one, like."
"No, only a bloke  I've never seen one  had one."
"Yeah, that'd be Richard."
Mm only he's got to  take his licence and insurance in.
As to what happens now he says I've to go to Magistrate's Court  so  it's just beginning to sink in that it's gonna cost him some brass and it's going to be serious.
They ring up at seven and eight o'clock at night.
Yeah.
Asking us whether we want to borrow some money.
"Er, asking if there's anything we co , look at him walking about with that"
"Everything, everything, what oh, papers have got, has got Legal and General on it."
Mm.
"So, I thought, well"
Yeah.
it can't be a a dodgy
I don't think it'll be anything dodgy.
It won't be dodgy.
Oh.
"But you can always, easily find out"
"What usually happens, though."
"All you do, is pick the phone up and and get, oh now, what place do you ring."
"I forgot what place you ring, but we're find out, and you ring up to see what they're, what the company's like."
"You know, if it's a variable company."
Yeah.
"Things like that, you could do that."
"Different companies take over, I remember that time we borrowed that four thousand pound."
"We started out with Key Finance and we ended up with Mercantile Credit, didn't we?"
Yeah.
"Changed companies three times, that time we had that four thousand pounds."
"You told me about that, yeah."
Well  said that it will be a sm a really small building society.
"He says, that, 'cos er, it's not"
Well.
"Big building societies are not prepared to give you rates, and small building societies are wanting to get going"
"You see, the only trouble with building societies is, it's the same when you buy a pigging house , they put the money on what you've actually borrowed every year."
Yeah.
"Well, finance companies only, you only get the interest on what is left."
On the money that you owe.
If we do this it will be a lot more meaningful.
Is that acceptable?
Yeah.
One point
Fine.
that occurred to me where we could
"perhaps give them some flexibility, is that we could say, if that's not acceptable to you, we will delay invoicing."
"Cos now we don't have to pay interest on our fees,i if, if, if a jam's spread over six months a a a and it might risk and slip to nine months, we might do better to offer to jam spread it over nine months and only invoice for part of the money."
Mm.
Don't like the sound of that.
Er
"the project engineer sits down and manually, let's be honest."
No.
Cos he's gonna just divide it by the number and it's it's
It's it's a very minor part of the operation.
Mm.
I think you've got a little bit careful with lots of our jobs which have got
very very small fees attached to them.
Yeah.
Yes.
which
"It's, it's hardly worth doing."
"at the present time we're saying to  on the monthly report we're saying to the client, we've spent three thousand out of five thousand, and their anticipated final cost is going to be five thousand."
Yeah.
And i he knows when we're actually gonna finish the job and therefore
Mm.
he can almost do that sum himself.
Yes.
I agree.
Er er I think on a bigger job i it it's perhaps a different story.
The trouble is Dennis a lot of our
little jobs.
What was that one?
it was about death penalty wasn't it?
.
"there's all sorts like, like recruiting, making contact with the schools, er, lobbying, er, there, there about ten or twelve different workshops now, almost on almost every aspects, so and that would be something that we could give, if, if these weren't  ."
"But there has to be one guarantee in  because I think once we had rather good one, about six people kept, you can never tell how many  come, I mean you'd want maybe bigger, more than, more space in this room."
"Well, we've, have got another room maybe we might sometimes be able to use haven't we?"
Well we could use the .
"Or your dining room, yes."
it's probably better that
"Mm, we often need to use one more than one room for those."
Mm.
Mm.
Though we do seem to be doing quite well in numbers.
"Yes, we have lately, yes."
Better than last year.
"That suddenly, I mean it means you divide into smaller groups quite often, and, and have discussions on  you can, yeah.."
Speak on what you've got.
"No, might be my speech, do we need a, meet, meet in a more public place, erm."
"No, no, we can't."
.
"But you, erm"
.
"Yes, yes, you, you."
"Erm, your business would take care of itself if we have that pressure of booking it,."
I honestly think it would.
"I think if anything, I'm sure it would."
"Yeah, mm, sure."
I think.
I'm sure that it would  make us more careful the months before.
"Mm, mm."
"Right, going on the streets think it would, going to find that many people that, that could speak to"
That was
Mm mm mm mm.
"he's very  fast  er, deduced  comedy."
There's a lot going on  at a very fast speed.
Which makes
Well I thought it was quite farce like.
Sorry?
I've seen the play and I thought it was quite like a farce.
You know
Yeah.
like
Okay.
But
"this is rather what  what it, makes it difficult is that  I had a copy as well farce  right, but don't say farcical."
That's got different meanings.
"Er, like farce  okay?"
As in this.
Any other things that made it  made it difficult for you to read?
So it's only the language?
"The language, if it had been translated in modern language there'd be no, no problem?"
Were there are any reasons?
"It's supposed to be a play, I suppose you have to watch it."
"When we were reading it I found that I was just reading it as a book and the  and that all the coming about you forget who's in, who's there and who's not there."
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
"More, again, much more by the shape of it, an intensely visual dramatic play, that relies on you being able to see"
spatially  in terms of space  on the  stage.
"People knocking on doors, people hiding behind things, people coming on in costume."
"You know, on the page you can't work out  why erm,is suddenly called  erm  nuns, somebody called the Captain, you know, you, you, you think these are three different characters."
"On the stage you wouldn't make that mistake, you'd be able to keep track of the identity."
"So, another reason  that just adds that  is the element of disguise."
"In Shakespeare  you know, you haven't got that many disguises going on."
Yeah well that don't help with getting your money though does it?
"No  and what's happened is, he's been up the bank  and er  the thing has"
Saved his money.
"and the thingo's gobbled up his card  as he said, well if it hasn't  gobbled your card  then  no problem."
If it has
There's a problem.
"we'll have to re-issue another one which could take sort of, you know, this time of year it's over a week  so  he said well it definitely has."
"Did he say, I'm desperate for my money!"
Yeah  so he said well  what do erm    and he said the woman up there didn't really ask what had happened!
It was A T S.
Why did it gobble his card up then?
Well because A T S  had gone  straight to the bailiff  and the courts  to freeze his account.
Ooh my God!
Mm  because his account was frozen  as soon as he put his card in  it took it in!
Oh!
"So he said, can I get a new card?"
Could you have that done to you then?
No.
You couldn't have that done to you?
"Oh sorry, I thought you said did I have it done."
Well no cos I ain't got one of them sort of cards have I?
His was like sort of a bank credit card  but bank said he put the cheque card in  and that was only a fifty quid thing anyway.
But he
Alright.
could draw it up to a  a thousand pounds  on that card  I mean
"And you said he's only just paid it, well"
"That's what he said, if I'd known what I know now, he said I wouldn't of paid it!"
He says I'd better go and check the money  so he said erm  but what he couldn't understand was  they wrote to him and said that  they haven't paid the cheques  but they didn't say anything about freezing his account!
"Well they should by law, surely!"
Well  dunno.
So he said erm  I said to the woman  I went to the court this morning  so he said   when you explain to me  he said I've got money in my pockets cos I borrowed it from dad  tha he said I owed sixty two pound  so he said I said to the woman   in the  court  how can I pay this  the sixty two pounds  when you've frozen my account?
"She said, that's your problem!"
Mhm.
the ins and outs.
Mhm.
But that happens all over.
"Mhm, what's the pay like compared to other factories in the area?"
It's quite low.
Is it?
Mhm.
Because er  how many years ago is it?
"Seven or eight years ago we, we, we're on piecework, we made our own wage."
"Er and most of us had in excess of a hundred pound, maybe a hundred and six, a hundred and ten pound, but when this guy bought place over, there was a kind of flat rate, and we'd to drop sixteen pounds to ninety"
Mm.
pounds.
"Well at the time you're thinking, God that's better than twenty or twenty five pound if you were unemployed,"
That's right.
"on the brew, kind of thing."
Mhm.
"So you jumped at the chance, but it is, I think th th poverty wage in Europe is it not, not about a hundred and forty, a hundred and forty five pounds?"
"Well we're nowhere near that, nowhere near that."
"Mm, that's right, mm."
That's why when I hear my daughter talking about getting fifteen or twenty K a year I'm going  it would pay me two or three years  for God's sake.
You can look after me then.
But saying that if you want a decent wage in here you have to work a lot of overtime.
Yes.
And most people do.
Mm.
Because er i from the management point of view if you have got four hundred people and you work a lot of overtime that saves you having six or seven hundred people.
Mhm.
And if you want to cut back you can either cut down on your workforce or you can cut down in the
Mhm.
overtime.
"In my department just now they're working seven days a week,"
We've gotta devise a new land reform law.
What's our priority?
"What, what, what really is the land reform  to achieve now?"
of feudalism
You've gotta
Right.
Yeah.
Protect commerce and industry.
protect commerce and industry.
"Yeah, I guess it's all"
Just looked after  go on.
Erm  well  erm it's that
Yeah.
we are now in power  but I don't think  that presumably proved that we can run an economy efficiently
Mm.
and
once we've got that then we have the resources from that I think to introduce other programmes that take
Mm.
"quite a long time to implement, for example"
Mhm.
erm
"Wh when you're saying to run the economy, do you mean the rural economy or the economy, you know, China as a whole?"
Well let's say we've moved on to and we're into nineteen forty nine say
Yeah.
and we've  in nineteen forty nine
"and  w w w we are either half controlled or we're, we can now see that you know the civil war is, is going so quickly our way that we are going to have control  within a year or so we are likely to have control over the economy as a whole."
D does that begin to make a difference?
Yes because now
Right.
Yes.
So we then have to coordinate our policies
Mm.
No cos I wasn't too sure if it was available  you telling me it is available.
A as I said this morning t to the management team it is available.
The only problem is as a one-off exercise on
er existing jobs.
We will have to put in er a summary of the existing remit.
Including
Right.
all the variations and what not.
"And that's something that Mike  and Ken  will help dig the historical contracts out and, and suggest er a remit."
"Erm b cos, cos he, it prints a remit back out out the client ."
"But it, it, it's ready"
"When, when are we likely to, to have the contract reports available?"
The Q S
the physical works
The physical works.
Yeah.
"We're gonna start specifying that now and Brian will, will er"
Right.
"will start to, to, to work that up."
But of course that can become quite a complex thing depending on how much we want to sort of use it to produce certificates and things like that.
Right.
So that's gonna incorporate the Q S cost report as well as the physical works is it?
Yes.
Mm.
Yes.
"A and that's, that's gonna be quite a complex erm"
Right.
thing to specify.
As it's a p it's a pound to a penny
Mm.
"that, what we're doing at the moment, we won't want to b put it all in this system"
Fine.
Specially with Palace I think they seem to think  but they really .
Should have finished them off in that first
Yeah   Can I just flick the light on for a second?
Thank you.
"Yes, see who  I mean  I can't think of anybody who's in the reserves who could do any better than the lot that are in, in at the moment."
Can you?
"Other than perhaps give Colleymore a full blooded  game, right?"
Doesn't he get a full blooded game at the moment?
"I think perhaps it's, it's worth it now."
"The season, I mean we're not gonna come top of the league are we?"
Right?
We've gotta make sure we stay in the first division but
I think we can afford to blood Colimore as a good one now.
"He could have this whole of this season to get used to playing, right?"
Yeah.
And then who knows what fireworks could happen the season after.
I mean  he's never gonna be a  when he's obviously another Bright.
Who wants another Bright?
We're supposed to  to the better style of play.
"No, I don't know."
Well why did we buy Gabiadini?
Why?
What would be the point of buying Gabiadini?
"No, well I, I mean you saw the point really."
"I mean  to pick I mean who, who  who could replace ?"
"He's, I, he, the way he plays is virtually unique, isn't he?"
So I mean you're not gonna say  well let's go and get another Ian Wright off the peg so fair enough.
But er  in the kind of situation where Ian Wright was very very good was in tight situations.
differently through se sheer speed and  but er I can see Gabiadini  I mean Ian Wright never flicks like some of the flicks that he does.
I mean some of the flicks are fantastic.
But erm there is a nice side to his game but god he doesn't half fade.
"Can you afford somebody that fades like that, I don't know it's"
"I mean really it, it's erm  er we, we have a form don't we we, we use when people are interviewed for something or other?"
"Well if we put their name and address and phone number on it, I mean  it's probably just as well to use a standard thing that you can xerox."
Yeah.
Maybe Jim and I could
And when they ring up
do that this avo
Yeah.
"When they ring up we can just say oh yes, what's your ?"
Now look this is meant to record
"this, this, this is meant to record"
"life as it is lived, English as she is spoken."
You're not meant to bite your tongue like that.
Right.
Yeah if we
You can swear in the privacy of your own home.
It was your company that I didn't want to swear in front of
not the tape actually
yes alright
"No if we er do something so as they have a checklist and we can all, you know like me and Jim say, have a copy to say oh right, can we take your name and address, telephone number"
"And if you've got a pad of them or or, or some by you you can just fill it in and let it go through."
Yeah that'd be a good idea
Write the name and address and phone number down and then
Yeah.
it's there.
Okay I'll buy that.
Cos you you'll almost certainly need to ring them back.
Yeah.
Even if it's to say erm
Oh sorry!
sorry we've got enough.
Yeah okay.
"Erm and that also makes sure, if you've got it all in front of you, erm that ensures that you're getting all the information that you need rather than thinking oh hang on, what else do I need sort of thing."
Did he come with the start of the scheme then really?
"No well it wasn't the scheme he worked on, he would go round and sort your cooker or you know he was that, maintenance, the maintenance side."
"Er other thing, and they lived down there opposite the garage, that was the electricity board house then."
So would that be about er the late fifties or something you would you came here then yourself?
I ca I came here in nineteen sixty one.
Sixty one.
Mhm.
"That's when I got married, nineteen sixty one, I came up."
What did you think of  when you came ?
"Well it was just a quiet wee village just  I had come, wasn't much different it was quiet as well."
Mhm.
And er there wasn't there wasn't much difference really.
"Everybody was very friendly, it didn't matter whether you were an incomer or not, they always spoke."
Mhm.
You got to know people  very quick  in .
"That was one thing about the village, and your your neighbour would where Jane is the now, I don't think she'll have hardly seen her neighbour in Dumfries, but here they were always you know"
You couldn't get away from them.
Oh they were in or out.
So did you do any singing when you came here first?
What was the first kind of thing you got involved in ?
"Oh the rural choir, I forgot about that, yes, I joined the rural choir and ."
"And er I couldn't sight read or anything like, I can't sight read."
"But I can remember once when I was at the school Mrs  was our music teacher and we were to go from doh to far, you know doh to far, and they used to s , she used to say listen to Mabel, Mabel's the only one one of you that can go from doh to far."
But er  so when we came Mrs  the sight reading of course I was lost because she used to
Is that Mrs John ?
No Mrs Billy.
Billy.
She used to take the rural choir.
How long had it been going then when you came?
"Oh it had been going for quite some time, I don't know really when they would start."
Was it all ladies ?
"Mhm, yes, oh aye, all ladies."
A word.
"It was, well it is, you, you stick in pieces of articles, into a book, you're collecting them."
Just any articles?
"Well, they have to correspond to the lecture, so  the lecture this week was, world population."
Had to so it.
"Like the world,"
And business?
the world.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And then, you have to get to about three to four articles on that."
I don't know where I'm gonna get them from.
And then
World in
"It, it gets a bit easier, because they go on to like health, age, I know I'll be able to find loads to stuff on age, won't I?"
"World population, erm probably what I'm gonna have to do is, although they, they said you can't do it  don't get any ideas about doing it with  because it's not possible."
It is possible
Mm.
"cos if I find that I can't find something, I'll just have to look like"
Keep looking as you're going along
"Yeah, do you know what I mean?"
"So, that's what  is."
"And it's just like, and they want you to make some comment on what you've worked out, which is no problem really, is it?"
"Do you know that newspaper that they brought out, the European, and it's like, just to, just to"
Yeah.
take you through the whole of Europe.
Yeah.
"like world issues, then,"
Yeah.
Because
"I know the Telegraph always have a lot of foreign, foreign news."
"But that's what, but The Sunday Times has always got a world news section at the back in it."
Norma.
"Pack  one, her."
"I know, I call that, but I mean, I don't  down the town,but her."
"But I, I didn't think I like that."
"Mum, mum watch this, are you watching."
You have to lose a race now and again.
"Yeah, but she ain't even,"
"Are you watching,"
"er, what was was I saying, the  I don't know what George has  all the customers, I mean, she's isn't even particularly"
"isn't she, she's not what you call really bonny, she ain't got a right bonny face."
I know she's got a nice figure.
"She's as thick as two short planks, she's got a dirty mouth."
"I mean, I, you know, maybe"
I can't understand  your cross.
I know.
Cannot understand  or something.
Their as different as chalk and bloody cheese.
"Plenty of different people  cheap, er,the other people who have different likes to you, but what, what you might think's attrac attractive, somebody else'll"
Yeah.
"won't be, you know."
"To be quite honest, without talking like a school  on a fence."
"They're not very happy, they ain't been happy for a while, but it's getting worse,wh is, what is them now is, you know I say things to Colin, and Co I mean, Colin'll tell me like, you know, you know,over there, and er, he's latest thing is, they built this little office."
"You know when you go into  on the right, er a coal-house and a wash- house ain't there."
Yeah.
"The coal-house part it's is quite wide now we've done it, big coal-house, but altered"
"And then it twists, and like a small office, and when when I were there, after Michael had shown it me and Colin, he says oh, he says, er I'm come in here to get get out of way, and you know, he was like telling me, I thought I don't want to be a fiddle, because it's alright telling Colin, the boys"
"telling yeah,"
Yeah.
"ain't it, yeah, it's not like a woman telling you problems."
Don't knock my dusters off.
"Anyway, I just said, well, summat about  about what I said, I says, yeah,nice to get away from it all, ain't it, to be by yourself, and that's all I said, and I think he knew that I I didn't want to"
"but, and he said to Colin"
Do we need them
Bilingual?
bilingual?
They can't have been bilingual last time because they were hired from Staffordshire County Council.
No.
And the other thing er if they  they just haven't got anything like that.
Yeah.
They use sort of blank
Wasn't there a big fuss though because  there wasn't enough effort made on the bilingual side  the last survey we did?
I don't think so was there?
There's a letter in the file
Well that's
about erm why we didn't use bilingual staff for one of the particular dates.
"Erm it come from the county surveyor, apparently he'd had complaints."
But I mean it was purely a re a recruiting problem.
"Er you know erm the letter, the reply went back from Dave  saying that every  you know, possible thing was done to  get bilingual staff but at the end of the day  you know they couldn't come up with the goods."
"I mean the lengths they went to advertising, I hope we're gonna have more luck now."
"They had temping agencies, job centres, local papers  the job centre only came up with about two people."
So I'm touching wood that we're gonna be in a different situation.
"I wonder if, I wonder if erm  you know if you rang up erm  the county council and said   you know   I mean er  y just make use of a contact and say look, we wanna do this survey, you know, do you happen to know a any members of your family"
Yeah.
You know?
It maybe
Yeah.
You can very often er for instance at Cheshire very often  I mean there were sort of some people's wives would like to do it.
Yeah.
"It may be, you know?"
Yeah.
See how the response goes with this and then
Who is it you've spoken to at Gwyneth?
Er Gwyllam .
And where is he?
Well when when it was first read by erm  it was mentioned that it had been written by the Green Party by radio four and the Guardian and the Independent.
And as far as I know that's the only coverage I've seen personally of it.
"Well I s I saw an article in erm the Green Alliance, a fairly shadowy organization , er mentioned in their newsletter."
It was it was erm promoted by the association of conservation of energy.
Mhm.
So I rang them up .
But that's yeah I haven't seen much.
Yeah it's supported by the
Well no they said they said prepared by er
Oh right.
What is the Green Alliance?
I don't really know.
I don't know who they get their money from but they.
I mean they used to provide the advisor to various secretaries of state I think didn't they?
Ooh
I don't know who they are really.
They send out this newsletter anyway.
But I mean the main the main I mean in it in certain quarters we've been down playing that aspect of it simply to get it through.
Sure.
But er all of the main organizations that have  you know World Wide  and Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth and so on and Age Concern.
They all know they were all told that it's it's all a bit above board.
But in promoting it to MPs we've been drawing their attention to the kinds of organizations which in turn in their eyes just sort of represent that pyramid or structure of votes that .
And of course when it goes through they already have our our as it were
Yeah.
With a bit of luck and careful handling.
"And the MPs who who asked to put it forward including Alan  they they had to you know they came to Ron  to ask, Can we put your bill forward."
They all know Ron anyway .
He's a very old hand in lobbying er which shows it's how it's we've got it this far.
Mm.
Because he's known this labyrinth  rubbish that they cling to.
Okay shall we move on to billboards?
Mm.
You'll be knackered.
I know.
Er yeah so we'll have this thing at Arrow Park to do.
He's hoping to do that.
"We'll looking into doing  we need to know how many cars gone in, how many cars go out"
Into the ?
of the hospital grounds.
But there's residential sections as well.
And then see how long each vehicle stayed there.
There's two entra entrances
You'll have to er take the registration of every bloody car!
That's what we are doing.
Jesus god!
It's probably because they're taking over the er  accident and emergency department from Clatterbrick it's shutting down and it's all going to Arrow Park.
Well that's not why we're doing it.
Well it is.
"That's what's happening, it was on the radio the other day."
This is just  well I mean it maybe connected with that but we're doing it because they want to increase the car parks .
So we're looking to do it with tape recorders  on the busiest entrance  and you know and just say car D five one four R G M  blah blah blah.
Get them all down   and then the person on the quieter entrance can just write them down.
But  you don't necessarily have to say the whole number.
You know you can just say D five one four.
"Well that's what you wanna, so much quicker wouldn't it, just say the Escort D five one four."
"Yeah, you don't even have to say the  the make."
"And then  erm they all get punched into the, Rob's got a special computer programme thing, you punch them all in  er  and then it does a ma a matching thing."
"And it  come, at the end of the day it comes out with all the ones it's matched, the duration it's been there  and er makes it a damned sight easier basically."
Should be quite good.
Then we've got  in June we're supposed to be doing journey time surveys and traffic counts on the M sixty three.
"I won't get off at this one, no?"
No.
I'll get off at the
Erm now they're talking of doing roadside interviews in both directions on the motorway on the slip roads.
what's the point in making them worse.
I know.
"So, jump in me box, and I ain't jumping in me box blind, for the last ten years."
I'll manage the way I am.
"You see, that works where I"
Benjy
"Aye,"
"Benjy, look at 'im."
Benjy
"Where are you, when it's gonna be, he said corner, then we'll make an office and a little canteen in that anyway."
"Then there's another long unit right at side of it, just enough to get one trailer in."
"I said, I said, if we do get going, and we do start finding out that it's going alright, he'll turn that, into like er, shop er, blasting shop."
"And like,"
Yeah.
"A spray area, then"
Yeah.
Employ a sprayer.
"So, I mean, we know what we want, but  it's them and not us, I mean, it is frightening to start a business up, 'cos we don't know how much work we'll be getting, but, I mean,"
"Well, it's same for anybody starting any business, ain't it, you don't know if it's gonna work  as well."
"It might go well for the first three or four months, and then all of a sudden we might have a lapse in a few months ,"
Yeah.
you could be struggling to keep it above
Yeah.
"and especially, you know, these bloody big firms, they do not like paying bloody bills."
No.
"I mean, you could have as as much as two or three thousand pound owed to ya, but your business will still go under."
"Yeah, because of it."
Because of it.
Yeah.
"They don't look on them things, how much you've got owed out to ya."
I know.
"When you look you see everything's a bloody risk,"
"as he thought, authenticate it"
"What, what they call it, stressing it don't they?"
"Stressing it, yeah stressing it"
Mm
and er it would of been impossible to rest your feet on the rail them performing the most uncomfortable
"contortionist, it says here"
oh
Mm
"but did it look authentic with the thing, I mean not to the extent of"
"Well I mean to the untrained eye with a , this guy was suspicious when he saw all this cracked varnish"
Yeah
which it turned out to be wax
Oh
to simulate old varnish you see?
Oh
So then he started looking
Yeah
They've got a way of measuring wear on er stretchers
"Yeah  I mean it's, it's so clever really isn't it how, how they do sort of er fake furniture like that."
"I mean to my mind you might just as well spend your money on, what are you doing idiot, on a well made piece of furniture today like some of those we've seen in, in"
"beautifully made erm, I mean they're brand new but they will be antiques I suppose in the future  you know for your, for your grandchildren sort of thing, but er I mean you can't possibly think what's"
"things that are in there, it's astronomical."
"Mm, quite expensive as you say"
"Mm, you silly dog, what are you doing, what are you doing, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, right, right, then, yeah, yeah, yeah, get him, right  oh he said that heaven"
Mm
"yeah, you do  huh, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow,Where's Muffin, behind the settee?"
Yes  mm
Did you read this erm review about Ruby Wax?
No I haven't read that yet
"She's is a, quite a"
"character actually, mind you she does er, it looks like one of those programmes you know er, when you don't want to be sitting in the front row, if she's going to"
Mm pick on you
"Most graphs will keep going on up, and there's a tendency for people to make them come back down again"
Mm.
or at least to where they started.
That means it's going backwards.
"Erm  now you don't do, paper three, you don't do  velocity time graphs, but you probably do them in physics don't you?"
You would do them in physics.
It's just like pure coincidence.
Aha!
Oh that's a good one that.
Revising it yesterday to be honest.
That's a good one.
got all pictures in it.
"Yes it has, but these are, those are, I've seen those before and they are very nice graphs, I would recommend them to anyone."
Right.
"So, you were revising them yesterday."
Should I
"Well the big thing, ah."
"See, it's very easy to get confused between distance against time, speed against time, and even acceleration against time."
"Yeah, because I mean it had them in our exam,"
Right.
"in our mock, we had like those four pictures, and you had to say which was"
"It comes up time and time again, and you have to know the difference between the different types."
"So  you also, when you get used to each type individually, need to then be able to switch between"
Mm.
between one and the other.
Yeah.
"So if we've got erm  acceleration against time and we get, no, no peeping."
No peeping.
"We get a flat one, what does that mean?"
"It's  Every one second, you've gone further."
We haven't gone anywhere
we've measured the acceleration.
Oh nine.
Right.
"So,."
It's a million so one million
It's a
times minus one million.
Is?
million times
And what is the sign of it though?
Minus.
It's the same
Right.
So it's minus a million squared.
"So wh when X is very big well, say, when it's big compared to ten"
Yeah.
this looks like Y equals minus X squared.
Mm.
"And this part of the graph, in there I mean that wouldn't start showing until we get beyond about say twentyish."
"At that point, it could be doing all sorts of weird things, and you'd think oh, I've got this wonderful graph and I plotted a lot of points close together, so I know my sketch was right, because it looked like this funny W thing or M or something"
Mm.
"erm it might well look like that for that very small piece of graph, but the overall picture you've lost completely by not going far enough so you, you want minus infinity to plus infinity."
"When you substitute infinity in, just think well if it was about a million, what could we ignore?"
"I mean, you could work all this out  right."
Ten X plus another ten X. Okay?
"And then minus a hundred and minus X squared, and put the millions and things in but don't need to."
"You've got it factorized like this, you could just, oh, that's about a million."
"It's about minus a million, so it's about minus a million squared."
And there'll be marks going for .
"It's where most people throw it away on the sketches, they just pick a tiny, tiny portion and look at that in great detail, say ah, look at that, wonderful."
Mm.
"But you've lost the, the overall shape of it."
"Tt, erm plotting graphs, you had one question didn't you where they asked a gradient?"
Do you think that makes any difference?
I think it would really in a way  and yet the people in  know how you sing so the  whereas the  maybe wouldn't know.
Mhm.
"And you would  you would be more, you'd be more nervous in case they they thought, Well she's terrible isn't she?"
"But it would also be fresher for them, you know"
Oh yes.
folk folk that know you either w might be too critical or they might just switch off because they have heard it before .
"They have heard it before, mhm."
But I've never  well I've never really
You've never
sang in  anything other than the pantomime that
Mhm.
"int he village you know, except maybe at  at the  Social or something like that, said, Come on up and sing and then I forget my words and  that's me."
"Do you like to know where, for quite a while in advance what you're going to sing then  ?"
I do really.
"Aha, I do really."
If somebody's would l if somebody wanted me to sing I really would like to know er because
Do you not have a wee store of your favourite things then that you
"Oh I have a wee store, yes, but you see you don't carry them, I don't carry them with me, if I carried them with me I could sing  I could, well that's it,"
"If you did it more often maybe,"
"I feel if, yes, you would remember them an awful lot easier."
Aha.
But er
"What, how did how did you collect the songs that you sing then, I mean were they just things that"
"Just taking  aye, just songs that I liked and  I just er take them off tapes and, and records, and I just write them down,"
Do you do that all the time?
"Are you always, when you're hearing something"
Mhm.
you're listening
Mhm.
"thinking, Oh I'd like to sing that ."
"And I'd like to, aye, and I just  write it down in a  if it's on a tape you can put that pause on and just take line by line, you know."
"Everybody comes from miles around, all the kids come and the parents last year, was it last year?"
Yeah.
"it look just like a ski resort all the bright jackets and the woolly hats and it was lovely, I mean they made it into, into an absolute skating ring for driving on"
Couldn't get your car up .
"Which, every, every thing went sideways, but it was such fun"
Mm.
"and the sun was shining and everyone had got pla plastic bags, anything they could get to slide on you know"
Oh yeah.
"they were going down our front lawn then down the, then down then down the roadway, cos it's a dead end you see, so there's not much , not much traffic"
"oh I see, oh you're alright"
"It's not, it's not when you get to the end of it  then there might be a couple of ."
"Yeah if you, if you're coming up you daren't stop the driver and there's things hurtling at ya, there's kids on sledges coming at you at about fifteen miles an hour and you'll have to try and drive around them and"
I'll stick to the old  what they've got in California then.
"Oh yeah, erm, oh I'd rather have our climate I think."
"It get up over a hundred, people killed"
Oh it's horrible isn't it?
it's a high death rate some .
"Yeah, yeah."
"Funny actually they couldn't, when the rescue people came they couldn't see where the damage was because of the dust."
Really!
"Mm, it's, it's, it's on this mornings news"
Oh .
"This dust, this dust  in California."
"I have heard, I have read about it ."
"This dust , and a, what's it a hundred and fifty cars all piled up on top of one another"
Oh shit.
"and there's a lot of people isn't it, and they don't know how many's dead because there's so much dust they can't see."
Oh how awful.
.
Oh that's awful.
So.
I wouldn't like it that dry.
So that's what words are about.
Now brr any anybody here like me from Yorkshire?
No you're from slightly further north.
You're from Yorkshire?
Sometime ago
"Sometime ago right so you may catch this, and you're from slightly further north than that I think?"
Right okay.
Anybody from the Liverpool area?
No no okay.
If I said to John and Joanne erm that I saw a boy running up the ginnel no you understand?
You do you do?
Yeah
I know what you said but I dunno what a ginnel is.
Okay a snicket
I don't know what a snicket is either
No
No
Yes
But I know what you're saying
"Alright yeah, okay you see the point that that it's it's words  what the heck's he talking"
No no I know exactly
"Oh you did, yeah it's it's er no but I mean in terms of the actual word you don't know what it is"
No
er it's it's about geography isn't it? er coming from different areas of the country.
Right let me just explain then just just for the sake of completeness.
"erm in the days when they had terraced houses back to back terraced houses erm well anywhere in the country I guess but but where I come from it was fine for the people who lived with their doors on the on the road but the people who lived at the other side of the block they couldn't get from the road so every so often down the down the terrace they had a little alley way  an entry I think you'd probably call it in Scotland, don't they?"
We  talking about this and I was saying about coming from construction I says I've says I've to go up the cut like
Oh the cut yeah
"Where I call the cut, and he's going the cut what cut that's the canal I says  up the cut between  the two the two buildings she said no that's the alley"
"That's the alley, yeah, or the ginnel or the snicket you know or in Liverpool they call it a jigger"
Or the cut
"Yeah so you see the point, if you're making a presentation and you use words like that based on where you come from the geography you know your regional variations then it's a bit it's a bit difficult for er effective communication isn't it?"
That's a   about a  innit  bloody hell!
Paying  they're paying
yeah so
Well you .
"so I er  he said er  no he said, it's not that he said  I don't like people to tell me  you've got to do overtime today, he said, I like to be asked!"
"I said well I'll be quite honest mate, there's two hundred people working in this factory  and I said, if you think that e all the charge hands and the supervisors have got to come down and roll up you lot to get the job done  I said you  turn round and you think if you was in business, whatever it is you like to do, if you're in business and you've got an order and that order's gotta be out by six o'clock tonight  and you've gotta grovel to your workers  otherwise you'd lose that order, I said what would you say?"
"Down the road mate, I'd get somebody who wants to do the job."
Yeah  that's right
I said and that's exactly how they are!
I said they aren't gonna put up with  like you!
"I said and that's why  cos Paul said to me, he said, I never hear you moan, I said look you won't hear me moan  because  it's not that I enjoy the job  I hate the job  I said I hate the work, and I find it hard work  but at the end of the day  on a Friday, I know that  six o'clock in the morning on a Friday  I can go up to the Nationwide Anglia, slip my card in there  and I know there's gonna be a couple of hundred of quid in there  with the"
Yeah.
"tax paid and everything, and I know it's gonna be in there  I said now that to me is worth a lot  I ain't gotta worry whether there's gonna be cheque from   out on my doormat in the morning  or if it's gonna bounce when I put it in  so I sa"
.
as far as I'm concerned
"whatever o overtime they sling at me, I'll do  not because I feel like doing it  but I need to do it  there's"
Yeah.
my wife and kid at home!
"So he said oh oh said his moan and groan  so he said well I spoke to Blue he said, he's off sick he said and he gets ninety pounds a week for being at home  I've been working here all week he said, for a hundred and forty  so I'm forty pound a week better off than him!"
Yes but he's sick!
I said he's not on holiday  he's sick!
Well forty pound a week's forty pound a week extra
Yeah.
innit?
That's
So I said
how much a month.
Yeah.
Yeah so I said to him
Yeah.
I said but what an attitude to take!
I said you're not working for forty pound a week
No.
"It's the same as that place in Australia where they haven't seen rain for seventeen years, I mean there's children who are grown up now at college have never seen a spot of rain, I'd hate that  I'd rather have our, sometimes dismal climate."
"Well look how we get don't we, when er we've gone too long with  shower of rain"
"Mm, mm."
you know the sun is nice
"That's right ,"
"and all that, but it the air get's so dry, that, that, you feel it wants dampening down."
"that's right, and when you do get the thunder storm well my family get into their bathing costumes and go out and stand in it because it's so lovely to have the rain."
That's right.
.
Get away with that now.
Yeah.
"oh well, we, really the weather's not to bad, you, you haven't got to be to sensitive about things have you, you've got to just take it enjoy the lot, enjoy"
"Yes, you have."
.
"Yeah, so far we've been very lucky in, in Britain I think, apart from the hurricane damage, once or twice, on the whole our climates is not bad."
"Oh, you  ."
"Yeah, but, you're mad getting worried to much, you know we had our green house all smashed up and everything and it's been upsetting ,"
Yes .
"erm, when you think about after all ."
"Yes, exactly."
Mm
.
"Exactly, you can't spend your life worrying about things, people are important."
You've got to try and enjoy life.
"My wife's father er he said to me, cos he was, he worked hard you know, he had a tough life you know up in London and all that as, as a kid and that and he said to me what you want to do, enjoy everyday that you live, I said yeah, oh I said oh but you can't can you?, he said yes you can."
"I said but when you're doing the job that you don't like, oh don't do it he said don't do another one"
Yes.
.
He's got the right out .
Too true.
He's got the right out look.
And for one reason or another the subcontractor bowled up on site on the Saturday afternoon and decided to do it then.
And he set up his own system of work using wal er er lookouts etcetera using er walkie-talkie radios and
staff exposed themselves to danger by standing in the four-foot.
His staff?
his staff.
Yeah.
There was nobody else's staff around at the time.
"It's likely we will ban the contractor for three months from, at least three months, from doing the work"
Mm.
although h he took a very professional erm attitude in dealing with the inquiry afterwards.
And didn't hide behind erm didn't try to make any excuses.
He said that it had been done wrong.
"He's actually sacked his own foreman, the main contractor cos the main, the foreman turned up on site and this I think is one of the lessons to be learnt, is that foreman turned up on site and saw what was happening"
and didn't stop it.
Mm.
And so condoned what was going on.
Mm.
And it's the major contractor.
Er may as well tell you i it's
So possession had already been arranged?
For the night.
The April the ninth.
For the night.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But they did it.
Mm.
Yeah.
"That's the only reason we found out, is our supervisor turned up to take possession, and the contractor's guy said, there's no point, we've done it."
So.
we've actually found it.
Could have been an inquiry into a death.
But we really need a candidate and there isn't anybody erm obvious who's in a position to do it unfortunately.
Fishergate this year?
Mm.
Yes.
Yes he does he lives in .
That's in Fishergate isn't it?
That's very true.
Must be an experienced person.
I don't know  cold candidate.
No.
Yeah the main difficulty is in is in the time period because it's it's quite likely that I mean I'd we'd been we'd been hoping that the target candidate could put in a reasonable amount of personal commitment to to the campaign.
"Other and if it wasn't for for me doing a course next year which would probably preclude me from doing that, I'd be quite interested."
But I haven't got I couldn't at this stage say I could do a tap next year.
Even the year afterwards may be not.
Well shall I ask Humphrey whether he's
Worth sounding him out.
Ask ask him if he'd like to do it.
We'll come back to you if we can't find somebody who's got more time I guess.
Okay that sort of covers I think what I need to know for for election stuff.
Because we've said we're gonna have a selection ballot.
Right.
Erm another thing I noted under any other business is green strategy document.
This Government one.
I mean this might not be a good time to chat about it.
I it's just that I remember on Monday morning hearing on the radio that it was being talked about that afternoon and of course immediately forgot to go and get a copy of the next day's Guardian and read about it and all the other
It's today's Guardian.
It's today's Guardian.
I've got it I've got it at home I can bring it in at the next meeting or whatever.
That would be good.
Or drop it into their office.
Possibly we could have later event if we'd read
Especially
Okay.
"Could I briefly go back to liquidated damages, because there's nothing in the procedure, I think, that says what happens when you send that form to the client, he says, I haven't a clue."
What do you think?
Cos that's exactly what's gonna happen.
Because I've seen
Oh dear.
that form before and they will not know what to put on it or what they
You may be l well be right there.
Maybe  to tell them what liquidated damages
They need leading by the hand gentlemen.
Can't we just put a clause
"We need, we need, no."
They don't.
Organize everyone by us.
Perhaps we should set the course up.
Course up and .
Eh?
Absolutely I like that.
Yeah.
No.
It's very frustrating because I've never never known a client who knew what his losses were.
We'll run a course for project managers.
"As Hugh, Hugh is indicating that th that we have got a degree of expertise and we should be offering that expertise to clients."
Well we can tell him how much we'd be charging them to .
No.
No.
No.
"What we've got to do is say, look, within the terms of the contract"
This is what .
this is what you have to do.
You have to make a genuine pre-estimate of your
losses
Well he got promoted didn't he  he's stable now that child though hasn't he?
"Until they start tre tra blurgh they start treatment straight away don't they, these days."
Oh he's only twelve and ended up as one of the  smallest birds
"But it said I heard that it said chemotherapy well what's that's erm drugs is it, no that's radiation isn't it?"
Makes your
Oh y
hair fall out
well you wouldn't give that to a little baby would they?
Well you'd have to.
I thought they washed the blood out  changed all the blood.
Blood type  and that's what that other woman died  girl died of didn't she they
I was saying to Trevor  it's it's not very nice but it's rather so much better than than than having a cot death isn't it?
If you see what I mean.
Mm.
"I can actually imagine the feeling of going to a cot and then finding no  no the child was dead, that's awful."
Done  there was a  our school dinners today  I went into this  give you four pounds back  I get twenty two pounds sixty  Have you got two tens in change of a twenty?
I haven't got  five pounds
Have you got two tens you want to change for a twenty Paul?
No sorry.
That's been quite good that cos you know  I had a hundred and ten pounds left
Mm.
I only took out the palace because I knew  I'd given I'd written a cheque for forty
You'd written out a cheque
"and I've only just started, still got two people outstanding so I've got that forty pound and I put that into the building society and use that forty pounds  for months see  so it kind of like saved it for me, I've managed, had to do without it"
Yeah.
and er
When have you got to pay all that.
What mu a a th agent says I only have to pay it off a day
How much is it?
What just write a cheque?
Yeah  and that way .
Well you won't be there on the day.
"You know Ben Lech?hill, red hill going down to ?"
"I was young and foolish at the time,"
Fifty miles an hour on a bike ?
"Very, very high gear on it, we used to go out a couple of us"
And er  we were passing this M
You've got this on tape remember?
Oh no!
"We went past this bloke in a Morris Minor,"
"a convertible, with a  eyes streaming, it was really hard to see, and  clocked his speed at fifty, and er the bloke behind me nearly got hit,because when I went past this bloke  I went"
all over the road.
No you didn't really though did you?
Ooh no.
"No, no you didn't."
No officer I didn't.
Distance okay?
Yeah.
And displacement.
"When they measure your speed, they're measuring your velocity really, they're measuring it in a particular direction, along that road."
Mm.
"Erm so  we'll call it distance, right?"
"But we're actually talking about displacement, just so that you feel more comfortable with it, cos there are other things coming up to make you feel less comfortable you see."
Okay.
So the police say you were doing forty miles an hour.
You say how do you know I was doing forty miles an hour?
"I wasn't driving for an hour, you weren't following me for either an hour or forty miles."
"They say, ah well, we followed you for a tenth of a mile, right, and it took you so long to cover that."
"And we, our little machine here has calculated it that that's forty miles an hour."
Yeah.
"Okay, so what did they do?"
"They had your hundred a hundredth of a mile say, let's say it's erm  let's say it was a tenth of a mile."
Nought point one miles.
And they divided that by erm  nought point O
"I I I think really they er  they forget that that there's a  quite a large number of the population, they do think about what's going on, and they're not all children and they're not  and aren't all that easy  easily persuaded."
"But, having said that  there is  but there are, but there as well!"
"No but I mean,the there's but there's a lot of people, you see  when you say they're not easily persuaded  that  are working class  that are voting Tory  and they're not easily persuaded they cha"
"Well they did, I"
just changed their mind!
Mm.
Well  having  seen a little bit  erm  was on the other day and I I mean I  I must admit I touch  shut up you!
Nothing to do with you!
"A lot of what's erm  you know, going on now, I mean, is just gonna go off as far I'm concerned cos I mean I've already made up my mind."
Yeah.
I'm a loyal supporter!
Well that's it!
And that's it!
"But erm  you know o , I mean it's, there's so much analysis and what not, I mean I I think most, most people must do the same  a lot of them have made their minds up and the ones who haven't  either don't really care"
No!
"or  they're so serious about it that they'll probably be watching everything, you know, just to sort of make sure that they know everything about"
Yeah.
every party!
Yeah.
And making sure I get the right one.
"But I think the majority of them just won't bother anyway, to watch"
No.
they've already made their minds up  and a and definitely a lot of people vote on on  on basically the choice
On the spur of the mom on the spur
Well
"of the moment, on the day"
think well they've had long enough now we'll  we'll have a switch you know
"Or or the  they like the look of the bloke, they like his photograph"
and they'll go and vote for him!
That's right.
"And I mean there's that been that much  publicity about Neil Kinnock  you know, or anti  Neil"
Yeah.
And that's looking up towards  up there.
"But the house is in quite good order, it has been extended."
"And that's er from the front view, I didn't go wandering in."
But that was the entrance to the station originally.
"Er  I don't know whether that's listed or not, but er I'm surprised it's still there frankly."
"So as I say, very very very er prominent building."
There's a little weighbridge or or office.
Er in somebody's garden.
And er you can just walk down either side of it.
Er onto the trail.
That's one of the see the old railway building there.
Erm looking up er the er line or that is looking from the bridge erm that's going down towards er th the just it it it er cur curved round to to meet the er the line er an and the s and the station was was here.
Just along the road.
Er that was erm  station just along here.
And that's a line from  between quite er steep er in quite a steep cutting.
"Looking towards  again from the bridge over the main road, er as one gets er near near ."
"Now moving on a little bit further, I know the talk said that I was only going up to er to , but I'm just going a little bit further."
We've cut across the er A six one four here.
Erm at the white post.
"Er and er  the line came from  over here, and on that embankment there was a bridge here, er but they farmer has er removed that embankment, but has still left this part."
And there's some still some one or two rather nice little bridges.
"Er still extant, and er now I rather like the architecture."
Erm and so I wandered up there and had a look at it and photographed.
"Interesting four four arch bricks, and er and and very nice stonework."
"And the copings there, the retaining walls."
"You can see the brickwork there, Nicely done and er very attractive for again for modelling purposes."
"Going a little bit further, I'm only er just a couple here."
"That's up erm near Not a very good picture that, erm but a er L M S eight er eight F, up near  that is."
On a er coal train going towards er towards .
And that's a an L M S crab also at .
"Again on a on a special, going towards Skegness probably, at a guess."
Now what's going the other way?
But it
Or was that last year what seven or eight of us wasn't it?
At St Michael's?
The church.
Yeah.
That was last year or was that two years ago?
Er
There was something at St Michael's but I didn't know it was the one world week.
Yeah I have never been involved in a  one world week event at St Michael's.
I thought there was one there .
You certainly were there.
In the church
No I don't I don't think
Yeah.
Anyway I mean hopefully this this will be sort of you know if it's well publicized it it will be well attended because of the past.
I think we might as well get in a few things and anyway I want some envelope re-use labels .
I've run out completely.
There you are  so many packets already.
Well if you don't want Traidcraft's re-use labels I don't care!
Oh!
I didn't know you did them!
Well erm
Doesn't matter does it
"well apart from this leaflet on recycling facilities, what else shall we have?"
On the stall.
Well who's gonna do the leaflet?
I will.
I think we ought to sort that out
"Well that will be, I personally think that's the only thing we can do."
"And we should just sort of say what is necessary to find out and everybody gets a few telephone numbers or telephone calls  check out addresses  find out about new ones, get in contact with the district council erm what is in the pipeline."
Find out about Uttlesford possibly why there's is running and whether that is going to br breakdown.
"Erm and if we then find money for printing it I would approach Barclays Bank, banks, local banks  and would it do it very modestly the same local the same style er and only hand it out to  places where people are likely to pick it up."
everybody saw was not the
Mhm.
fit strapping Heseltine which I wished
You looked terrible.
which I wished to portray.
But this sort of tottering wreck.
Yes.
"You know, hobbling to the helicopter  it was my"
foot which had had been had gout induced.
Nothing to do with the heart at all.
"Anyway, Sod's Law you know."
that's politics.
But you did look you did look truly awful in that picture that appeared in the newspapers you looked as if
"Well my real real girlfriends wrote and said, Michael, you've got lovely legs."
But did you think you were going to die?
I mean was it
No no I didn't.
"I mean I must be honest, I did not feel that frightened erm it wasn't an acute pain that that I mean I mean one of the things that one has to realize, you can become a heart attack bore."
Very easily.
"Everybody who's had any sort of tremor or experience or much worse, they're all individual and it's no use me talking to you about my heart condition, because you haven't got my heart."
"Erm e e they're all individual and mine I think, looking back, was erm erm er a light er experience and I mean as I've said, the  the erm er w this telescope they shove up you, er I mean, Chris Patton had the same thing."
Erm is local anaesthetic in the groin.
"Up goes the telescope, you're lying there you know, and the doctor told me, he said, Do you wanna watch?"
Do you wanna watch?
"And I said, Ah."
You know.
Anything but.
Absolutely.
But erm anyway that's it's all it's all now a few a few months ago.
"Did it change your perspective on anything, on life, on politics, on what you're doing in in in the job?"
"Well I suppose erm well I  I I I mean I remember er ludicrous really, sort of thinking of what I would say at the Tory party conference while I was lying in  that hospital in Venice."
And I actually made some notes .
"You could substitute it, perhaps for that one."
"Yeah, okay, okay well look,"
Have a think about it
"yeah, okay."
"if, if you want to do a version of it first, I think we, we, we'll appreciate it very much."
"Okay, fine, okay yes."
"in order to get, because I hesitate to give you more work to do, you got enough work."
fine.
"But, think about it, it could be interesting."
"Yeah, okay, sure, fine."
We'll have words about it.
Thank you.
come on in.
"Now, I have some good news for you, and you could do with some good news, couldn't you?"
Yes.
"Least, I hope it's good news, from what you said last night, I think it would be good news."
"I have got you a computer, one of these  would you like one of those?"
I'd love one of those.
"Right, we can get you one."
I'll tell you what's happened.
"The thing is, the school has just launched a, a new programme to lend portable computers to graduate students, okay?"
"Now, we've got one in this department, like this, and er, one of our graduate students was very interested in it, and since she was just finishing her P H D   the in some of the ways, some of the most erm, outspoken erm, persons for this, but I'm certainly not alone."
"There's a growing body now, of people who are thinking along similar lines, and er, so it's, it, it's, I think you'd be unwise to wipe this off just, just as my eccen eccentricity."
"I mean, it may be that."
"Look, we're gonna have to stop."
"we can carry on with this next week, as, as you see, we've touched on a big topic, so we'll, we'll leave it to you to introduce next week's discussion, whatever way you think fit, erm, that raises other issues which you want to talk about."
Okay.
Thanks very much.
And well done  that was an excellent
a little contradictory.
"Erm, I read another erm, book on believing this."
"Yeah, fine."
You've got six month's free membership don't worry about it.
Yeah I wasn't worrying about the six month's free membership.
But it does put in rather six months out of phase with the local membership so at least
Well John sorted that he's brought you up to date now.
Mm.
Because you know it's the same thing.
I was gonna give the er local party er  it'll be sixteen months  worth local membership
If you want to give us a donation that's entirely welcome.
Perfectly acceptable.
I'll buy some .
I've already bought some
yeah.
bought some  more er
So what Joe wanted the meeting to decide is should we ask Mark to send off a cheque for those three people?
I think that's the only way to proceed to to sort out this tangle once and for all.
Yeah.
You see apart from anything else if those people  joined through us then we we must make good .
And we fixed it.
The system's fixed so.
Yeah.
It it has to be fixed by either us or the national party.
We can't ask those people for money if they've already joined once.
Okay.
Erm I'll get Mark to send a cheque off when he gets back from .
Okay is that oh I suppose as as another officer I can er tell you that the the newsletter has indeed been finished and gone out.
Erm I would like to apologize on behalf of myself and my  proof reading team for the fact that two calls for nominations that erm that are in this newsletter don't actually appear to have closing dates on them.
Oh god.
Which is a bit of a stupendous cock-up from us
"At least on my part I'm, if I had my engineer's hat on I'd er blame the proof reading team as well."
But er I suppose really I er
Well you forgot to read it because you threw coffee over me.
I suppose the blame is at least almost entirely mine.
"Oh, brilliant."
So there should be something in there.
"I found something from the AIDS one the new Benetton advert, have you seen that?"
No.
Is it really sick?
Mm.
"Not really, it's a bit rude, I suppose."
"It's of erm,photo coloured photograph of, it's either a bloke or a woman, you can't tell, from there to about there, so you can see all the hair and everything it's got  on the skin H I V positive."
"Oh, I think I have seen it."
"Ah, that's terrible."
"They're just out to shock, aren't they?"
"Yeah, I think it's a good way, and, cos it makes people go, bloody hell."
"And then they take note of what the issue is, yeah."
"realize, don't they, yeah."
"So I've got all ready, for me AIDS  cos I used to just think oh I don't really, I could just go and get some leaflets on ban on"
True.
"Well, I must ad I'll probably end up going down there, and getting the"
Our local chemist at home.
"Yeah, they've, they've always got this good stand, haven't they?"
"All this stuff, loads of stuff down there about pregnancy, and measles."
"Yeah, so they reckoned it's not a scrapbook, but it is really."
"That's quite easy really, I'm quite happy doing that."
Quite like that idea.
"But erm, yeah, it's alright."
"I like this girl, cos she's Welsh, just, I can't do her accent, but she kept saying it several times, he was getting really pissed off with her."
He'd obviously taken time over building up this little booklet explaining the stuff.
She just destroyed it in one go.
Really?
"Like he, he was like saying, it's got to be a  the word book, will eventually  he was really getting into it and really going into about, you know, how it's really gonna be jam- packed with important information, and she just said,so it's just like a scrapbook really  you know, when if you've filled all that up"
Yeah.
and somebody said that.
"It's like, oh yeah, thanks."
Yeah.
"Right well we'd normally say, miles per hour per second."
"What's, what's your acceleration at the moment?"
Well it's ten miles per hour per second.
Okay?
"Well every second, I'm going"
I'm going ten miles an hour faster.
"So miles per hour per second, or you could measure it per hour if you wanted."
"Every hour, I'm going six hundred miles an hour faster"
So
so it's miles per hour per hour.
you'd need a stopwatch and a speedometer.
"You'd need a something to, I say, we've got something to measure the speed, radar gun,"
Mm.
"not interested in the distance, just the velocity, the speed."
How fast is that car going now?
"Okay, he's doing forty miles an hour."
Measure him again in one second's time
He's doing sixty.
"he's doing sixty miles an hour, so his acceleration was twenty miles per hour per second."
Per second.
"Twenty miles per hour per second,miles per hour, what's the change this miles per hour into metres per second."
"Okay, so,say a hundred and twenty metres per second per second."
And that's where your per second per second comes in.
Are you a bit happier with that?
Yeah.
But not totally convinced.
No .
"Erm  that length per time per time, is the unit."
Let's just have a little look.
What are the units of displacement?
Er
exac stop this casual labour business you see?
"Whe whereas the building trade would say oh I'll take you, you're a friend of mine, I'll take you you're a friend of  I can take you, you're a friend ."
"It was  It was  a great lot down in Leith here, and I've often seen it down in Leith docks."
"When I've been down there trying to get casual work, you know in Leith docks?"
"And he just down, they're all in a big crowd ."
"And a chap come out the offices and say right, you you you ."
So in actual fact it was always a favour cos I got the jobs.
"So to stop all that, this is with the b building trade, they had to guarantee them."
So presumably that was quite a popular piece of er legislation?
"Legislation, oh definitely."
Mhm.
"I've had s still operating now to present day, I don't know."
Mm.
What did you do erm after that?
Well as a  reach up up .
"In fact that's what I left from, I left from the job at job street in George street with the building trade."
That's when I .
And I  work after that.
"But the site  prepared to let me work, to carry on then as s they ma and I wouldn't claim my pension until I'd finished."
"And behind that, their reasoning for that is, for every year that I worked over my retir retireable age, there's a  that is added to my pension."
He says I  haven't got you working long  longer I worked the bigger the pension I have when I go out .
So were you allowed to work er after your retireable age?
"Not, not at that particu when they got to hear about it."
Mm.
"Of course they, they had questions of  and he says oh well I've sat with him, the man's prepared  working at Lambert, but no you can't allow the man to work after he's sixty and that was it."
So that was me on.
But the OAPs
Were you involved in any erm political parties or anything er ?
"No no not necessary though, though I have done quite a wee bit just now er in support of my Labour Party, you know?"
"Done quite a wee bit and I've been there at a few of their, quite a few of their meetings and erm a good friend of quite a few of the councils."
And Lothian  District Council.
Quite a good friend of them you know and I'm a close contact with them.
because it will be very complex.
"If you want to, if you start building a system that's gonna record every variation that's issued to the client and"
Make it simple.
print it all back again.
M see if we can make it
Yeah.
fairly simple.
"Could I just say at this point, this, this is one area where I would envisage us looking critically at what we're doing and, and, and, and altering things quite significantly over the next six months."
Keep it simple and build up on it
Beca
if we need to rather
Yeah.
than go the other way.
"Mainly because we're doing, we're trying to read the client's mind at the moment."
And w we we're putting together what we think the client wants.
"What I'm looking for is feedback from the clients which say, yeah, these reports are alright as far as they go but really I don't want all that information or I want this information."
Or
"And I would hope that we, we we enter into that with th that spirit and"
Mm.
"we're prepared to look at the the client reports and change them so that they become as good as we, we can get them."
Yeah.
Is there anything within these
It is the first step.
for the prediction of fees?
I mean we've just
Yes.
got something back from Intercity  on the P S work where they're wa wishing us to predict to certain date what we're gonna be spending over the next six months.
Nine months.
the football ?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well
Your mad!
"What is it though, what's historical linguistics?"
Is it like what we do in Old English or not?
Cos that
Yeah it is.
That sounds excellent.
Right it's due in week three I think.
Hurray.
"Er but  as far as I'm concerned if it comes in in week four, that's fair enough, but things after that then they start to get a bit upset"
"But I sa I said to Chris, When is it?"
"She said, Week three."
"Er and I said, Give or take a few days, and she said, Yeah."
"So if it's inside week four then that will quite reasonable, does that sound okay?"
Okay has anyone had a think about what they want to do?
I mean does anybody else know?
sort of everything we've had so far's been pretty general.
Okay if any of you wanted to you could always go out some tape recorder  and people have a listen to it.
But obviously if you're going to do that you'll have to do it during next week some time  On the other hand I could give you a list of five topics and you could choose one.
Yeah Oh yeah I mean there's five five things five things in men or women's conversation t to do and essay about.
"Say one about interrupting, one about topics, and one about perhaps interaction with children, one about er  what    Or you could even I mean if I did er I did a list of that you could even do the same one, you wouldn't have to do one each."
You know you got your erm tag questions?
Yeah.
might not be one of the question in it as  tag questions could be
Oh yeah.
specific.
Okay er  There's one title I've got written down here which I don't know if anyone's interested in.
Evaluate the claim that women are more d ob Evaluate the claim that women are more observant of the prestige norms in their speech than men are.
Does anyone fancy that?
Let's If I write down   Okay the  which I've just suddenly thought of were er
"turn-taking and interruptions and overlap and tags and tag questions, topic selection and interaction with children, which I think I just mentioned make sure you've got them down so we can forget them."
Er
What?
Alright.
May we go sir?
"Yes, you can leave the court now."
Thank you.
Back to case thirty one.
Miss  apparently you represent Mr   er well I  I notice from the documents with the er  summons it was adjourned  because erm  their solicitor wrote to say that he will be claiming not guilty?
Oh yes.
Is that the case?
"Yeah, your worships I understand that the  the prosecution are  are making application   I don't that you should go on with this."
So is it ?
If if it's not going to trial
When they were
we'll do it now we'll take it now.
"I wonder if I can insist, it isn't a matter where  and they have spoken to me about this  particular case  and"
Go to forty five your worship.
"Sorry, I forgot the"
"The view of the prosecution that this is matter  could be dealt with  quite satisfactorily by the way of  in the court  were minded to do that, if the court would accept that course of action."
I understand that Mr  would be  willing to be bound over.
Does that compare with that ?
Well obviously Miss  the magistrates will need to be satisfied there are grounds  why they should bind him over  they will also need to be satisfied that there is a fear for the future  otherwise they will not bind him over.
"I appreciate that sir, but you may feel at the end of the day that you need to hear  conducts from the case and if he is still present obviously  whatever the court wishes to do."
"I see, well in that case then I will leave it alone, I'll deal with this a little bit later on, obviously  it could take"
As you want.
possibly .
Who else is present Mrs ?
"Er  number forty one sir,."
Do deal with that your worships  please?
Forty one .
Are you Sylvia ?
Yes.
What is your date of birth please?
Ha?
"curiously enough, they seem to have I mean I I have"
"Yeah, but they have only to do with things like national security and and"
"Yes but er I I think that erm er the little by little, the conventions have been stretched."
And of course there's huge
do you think they should be tightened up again?
There's huge money.
Dramatic money.
You know.
"And and and and have no illusions, the money and the contents are very linked."
"That it's no use going round saying, Well here's my view of history as I wrote it."
"Er and it's factual it's it's analytical, it's it's erm devoid of the sort of bitchiness of politics."
Cos you won't get enough money.
You mean people spice them up
"Oh yeah, sure sure."
You think Mrs Thatcher's done that?
I have no idea.
I wouldn't dream of making such an observation.
But it sounds as though you suspect that.
I I'm not going to be drawn even by your deft questioning
Alright but the rules
in this direction.
But the rules ought to be changed.
There ough the rules ought to be hardened up to stop this kind of thing going on
I I I I I doubt if you could have rules.
I doubt any more whether we live in the sort of society where you could have such rules.
"Since we're talking about rules, what about erm Mrs Thatcher, Lady Thatcher wanting to change the rules so that a sitting Prime Minister can't be challenged."
Oh no certainly not.
Certainly not.
Certainly not.
"I w I I personally er made it clear at the time when they changed the rules er er fairly recently, that I didn't think they should."
"Erm I think that er erm politicians understand full well the nature of the profession in which they're involved and the parliamentary party is erm more than able to exercise a proper judgement, er I don't think there's any case at all for er changing th I don't think there was a case for changing the rules and I don't think there is a case for changing the rules today."
So you're out of step with people like Douglas Hurd and Norman Fowler?
Yeah I know.
I use contractions in the newsletter some times which is deliberately honest.
It's like saying avoid cliches like the plague.
I mean I I'd having been  these comments and yes there are a couple of extra points put in there I think that that's fine.
It's nice to get some of it done.
What about the rest of you lads?
Well as soon as I have a window in my diary which I'm not
We'll let you off with the newsletter.
contribution it is said.
Alright I'll I'll undertake to to come up with something for our next meeting.
I mean all I I didn't I just did exactly what I was told.
I put brought out a list of points.
There's no grammar in there.
There's contractions all over the place because erm and all sorts.
I even used numbers instead of writing them out in full verse.
So erm
You can minute me and I'll erm
Did you use any semicolons?
Probably put a split infinitive as well.
Well I've got the checking erm.
Right so Steve is undertaking to be the next brave soldier to  write something for
I don't know what I'm doing.
The general
We have to be very busy.
I mean this this this item has actually been deferred two meetings and
Mm.
Yeah.
We'll just been too busy.
Then I'll try and get something if I get time but.
Okay
Still I suppose the time's it's the actual the calendar's starting to tick for having this  isn't it now.
"Yeah if we're actually ever gonna make use of it we will, joking aside, have to try and get something  ."
"I believe there is so now, but there wasn't then."
"So it, it didn't really matter to me."
I've always still held my card.
Although I still held my card of the Transport and General Workers.
Mhm.
So you continue to be a member of the Transport and General
"Oh aye, yes, oh ."
Oh yes.
"God I  you could never tell if you're, you're going to be there long enough in job, if the, the boss didn't like you then he would just say well you're, you're paid off and that's it, so that's sort of benefit of keeping your union membership up you could go to anywhere where there was a trade union, a union membership and get a job."
"So er the, was being unemployed at that time quite precarious?"
If there was
"It was, it was."
"At that time, yes."
"It was er at that time because of the, they were very few and far between."
Employment was very few and far between.
"Because there wasn't the same amount of work,this is just after the war I'm talking about, and there wasn't so many  going then."
There were only starting making themselves then.
Er
"So were erm were jobs quite hard to come by in those days, after the war?"
Well er well it all depended on the individual themselves.
If there's a miner who's  in getting work.
Although you had to be very careful in er in d knowing what to go after.
Depending on the rate of wages.
Depending on the rate of wages.
"So you're actually, if you're going for a job, you want er for the highest place where you get the highest wages, which was a   for any working, you're going to"
What did you do after you left the erm after you left the timber mill?
"After the timber mill, er ."
Now can I remember about after the timber mill?
Let's see now.
My mind's a blank  I've been in that many different jobs now.
"I thought you said you were in a, a warehouse after that wasn't"
Oh that's right.
"Wednesday is a better day, and anyway Thursday's  erm   he's got a  he's gotta go at four  actually go at four not  an appointment, he's gotta go at four."
Why erm  why do the ministry keep coming down there then?
Do they turn up there?
"Well I don't know, whether they're trying to catch them out but they they certainly coming down more and more an and sort of more and more frequent."
I'm surprised they warn them that they're coming.
Well it's erm  the sort of things they pick them on really is not that
Not hygiene sort of thing?
"No, thing I mean silly little thing, well I think it's silly but there you are, they all see to  know what they're talking about but  I mean cer certain things like in the fillet room"
Mhm.
the meat is not allowed to go on just an ordinary pallet.
It's gotta go on a special one?
It's gotta go on a steel pallet  and yet next door  in the export chiller  they're allowed to go on a wooden pallet  and we work on wooden pallets  erm
I'm surprised they use wood.
Well if you see how many pallets they got  and you see the trouble is the metal ones are so slippery  they're all the while dropping meat all over the floor.
"Yeah I suppose they would, yeah."
There's loads of things they're on about  oh th the there's a whole  book what they gotta h have sorted out.
Do they?
Oh Christ yeah!
"Certain doors are not to be opened  things like emergency exits there's  they notice that there's more one of the emergency exits is actually broken, so the door don't even open."
Bloody hell!
So all that stuff
"Well then that is, that's gotta be sorted out because if you"
Yeah.
"had a fire there, somebody wouldn't get out properly!"
That's right.
Yeah.
Well that's like us we haven't got an emergency exit.
What way do you go to your nearest exit then?
"Well there's a bloody great  roller door, but you see it's at the end  we work"
Yeah well what about if the fire was down that end?
Well exactly!
How would you get out?
And I think they're ones that have a cartridge in.
And the information's recorded on the cartridge.
And they take the cartridge out and they send it down to Cardiff which is where Mel  is
Yeah.
"and he chucks it into, bungs it into his machine and then gets the printout then which he then sends to wherever."
Ah.
"So what we, we need to go to him I think in the first instance and say we want to do X Y and Z, and if he, if he says fine  you know."
"But if he says I'm sorry, I haven't got the equipment we then have to go outside"
Yeah.
obviously but I think you need  clearly in the first instance to use that
And you're saying to also mention to me if he's got
"Well I, it's just a thought."
I mean if we're gonna be speaking to him we may as well ask whether
Yeah.
"just to say that we, you know, that we'll, we, we're going, we're proposing to do some  origin destination surveys  interviewing, and we'll need the signing to go with it  that Gwyneth don't appear to have them and, and in consequence we're proposing to hire them elsewhere."
"Erm  and erm  you know, we know that last time it was done er the, the signs were not bilingual, the ones  census point and so on"
Yeah.
"and that erm is he w er would, did he think that would be a problem."
Yeah.
Cos I think last time we hired them from Staffordshire and I'd have thought if they're going to buy some they will be very happy to hire us them.
"Cos presumably, when you look at the layout  most of the signs are keep left signs."
Yeah.
Or you get the  you get ones that are sort of road narrows
Yeah.
"and you get the, the warning ones."
Yeah.
And the warning ones have a little census  plate on.
Erm  so presumably you perhaps need to do something about that.
But the keep left ones they're gonna have in stock aren't they?
Yeah.
"So the only ones you really need  and, and the, and the road narrows and the warning ones, they're all gonna be in stock."
Yeah.
"But I'll write her a postcard to say, Yes it looks quite interesting when can we see the samples and can you tell us more about how the money works."
Yeah and confirm that that isn't a daily price.
I think that I'll have to confirm with the company.
Yes.
But it just just seems suspiciously cheap.
That twelve
Well I mean it's not the huge massive billboards.
I mean if they're just sort of four foot things I mean it's not you know I think.
Yeah perhaps.
Anyway  that's really into this idea.
Especially Bob's suggestion of calling for people to sponsor
Sponsor
sponsor a poster.
Erm should I at least be prepared to again stick something in the newsletter about .
As you say it's the sort of thing that might appeal to people because then they can go and look at their poster.
Be photographed next to it.
What do you think?
We could always do  posting on the side of the Conservative building.
Your direct your direct action at home.
Yes well come and visit you in prison.
Right does that cover billboards?
Yep.
no that was a good agenda item just got silly.
Okay.
Who wanted to talk about affiliation stroke working with other groups?
This is something we said we were going to discuss at a time in the future and I thought I'd stick it on and see how much time we'd got left.
Right.
Well we've got twenty five minutes at present shall we can you just wipe around a couple of other things and then we'll come back to that if time remains?
Yes do.
Okay.
Right intro leaflet.
Do I hear apathy?
"Right, that's the other element, it's what you think they think you should be doing and it's amazing how few people, yeah that's the  yeah"
"I  talking about, but that's what job specs are all about."
"It might seem long-winded, but dependent upon er if you get it right at the start with it, it might mean that one of the things we're suggesting er you might say no, it's not for me this, but you might think that job analysis is a good way of identifying training."
What they've gotta do and why they do it.
What's the starting point for job analysis do you think?
What's the first thing you've gotta identify?
"Yeah, the need for the job er  er  yeah, not, not quite exactly what I'm looking for,the way of the trainer's dilemma isn't it?"
"I've got an answer for that it's not quite right, what shall I do?"
"Can I just say no, shut up."
Or should I and this is all part of it isn't it?
Cos he won't say anything to me if I don't know what's wrong
erm won't say anything else will he?
What  results
"Yeah, alright."
"Yeah okay, so we're looking for results."
The results of this person why are they employed.
So the results that we expect out the job.
If you get results it could earn a job analysis what would we do?
"If I, if I was a job analysis person, what will I  sit next to you wouldn't I and what would I have missed out?"
"Right, yeah."
Another word for main responsibilities.
"Mm, you're testing me today aren't you!"
Right.
Key  tasks  What is the person's key task?
This is difficult stuff I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on this  because it's covered on various other courses as well.
"Things like appraisal skills er level one level two, various others, other courses that we run."
"There's your job  the first thing I should do is say well what are the key tasks, what are the areas that would mean results?"
Perhaps a working demonstration might highlight something I'm trying to .
Take the job of a receptionist.
Who's been a receptionist?
You have haven't you Elaine?
Yes
What you you say the shock of it.
What what was it like?
All of those of us who haven't had a heart attack live in fear of it obviously and think
"Yeah well, I mean we all My father died of a heart attack."
Mm.
And erm er that was a long time ago.
I si think it's very possible that he wouldn't have erm died under today's
Today.
conditions.
I had wonderful treatment in Italy.
I was very close to a a hospital with a wonderful cardiac er unit er where they had a professor who was one of the leading Italian in the subject.
"I was there within an hour, so I couldn't be more grateful and appreciative."
"They're wonderful people, the Italians."
"Er anyway that the the but the actual experience, er one knew something was wrong."
"I was not frightened, I didn't think anything was that wrong."
"But I said to Anne, Look I think you better get a doctor."
This was before it happened or when it happened? you didn't have sort of intimations that something was going to happen ?
"Well I I you see, it's all hindsight."
"I think in truth erm er we'd taken a weekend off and er to go to Venice, there was a big er art exhibition on and Anne wanted to see that."
"Erm and I I wasn't feeling on top form and er looking back, I perhaps should have gone to a doctor then."
But you don't you know.
"Erm but th anyway, there it was and er I had this pain Not not acute, that's why I wasn't that worried."
it didn't last that long.
Erm and from that moment I got into hospital and I had no more trouble.
But I mean of course they plugged me up with all sorts of things.
Wi with of course one disastrous consequence.
"Which er I mean, damn the British media like all politicians do."
One of the things they have to do is to get your uric acid I think it's called erm content correct.
And it it so they give you some m medicine for that.
A side effect of which can be that you can develop gout.
And so the what what what that
"Ah, that explains"
If he's coming he might like to be
to be
There's a good chance of filling most rooms most nights I would have thought.
Well shall I ring Joyce back and say providing it's close erm we'll have it and take it from there.
Okay.
Oh I haven't written .
Shall I alert Dick to its existence then?
Yes I think that would be that would be a nice thing to do.
Cos that would be a nice definite.
Okay.
I'll make a decision when I'm in a position to .
Well this is why it would be a good idea to so people will have to decide in advance and just see how we go for
Do you have to send off a deposit or anything?
I'll find out when I ring and she'll .
If I do I'll be ringing round frantically  find out what to do .
I would suggest that given the decision we prepared to make now even if you have to send a deposit get the local party to stump up the deposit and collect the money as soon as convenient from the people who are committed to going.
Is that agreed with all of you here.
Sure mm.
Since the local party's going to cover the shortfall anyway if there one.
Okay.
she'll be subletting rooms to people.
Slum land for the Green Party   .
.
Right is that erm.
Okay presumably I should put something again in the newsletter about conference and this accommodation thing.
Yeah.
Yeah it it means that you can point out that it makes it a lot simpler for someone to just pop over for a night and crash out on the floor.
Are you coming to conference at all.
No I won't be er my family situation can change so.
Oh.
Don't have to do things like erm .
We can always run a little creche actually for  nanny from Scarborough got a baby as well.
And that's how we got them.
"And I di in the end they   the same for them, but"
He and Geoff went over there and loaded them on the trailer .
we would of done it by ourself  sorted out.
"Yeah we do a  we went over there and loaded them all on and then got a puncture in the trailer,!"
"Put them on a  didn't they, then load them  load"
Yeah.
them on  yeah.
Used be able to sit in the car   would be   go up the back don't they?
Yeah.
"And I used to load the boot up  and bring them  and load home like in the boot of my car  my Sales Manager said to me the other day, how the hell did you get bright red dust in your boot?"
I dunno!
There's all like red brick dust in your boot!
Oh no!
Geoff was getting the bricks.
"And I had Avenger estate, and I done the same with that  and I got away with it for ages and I   what you want a do, I know what you wanna do  he erm, I mean that's that's really sort of pushing it over the top  but he got a great big sheet of polythene, he went down to ready mix  and had a load of ready mix in the back of this  Avenger estate, brand new he'd only just got it!"
And course
Well we didn't do that but
and then on top of that he took the battery off  Pat's car  and it fell over in the front so all the acid burnt the carpet!
"Come back dinner time  and they were saying well no you see you can't just a borrow a car to go to dinner in, yeah that'll be alright man  and I hadn't even been in it  since Roy bought it back!"
Absolutely went spare you know !
"Sent memos all round, you know  and he called me in the office that day, to say I'm really disappointed in you, I said, what do you mean?"
"He said well I give you that Avenger estate he said cos I thought you were building your house, that'll be handy for you you know  yeah you did  and you let me down badly!"
"So I thought now what do I say, do I drop myself in it or do I say well that wasn't , that was Roy, I said well you know I said I must admit I said I  I'm sorry  so erm  then Roy said well that battery he said was me he said I, I borrowed Geoff's car again and look the battery fell over in it so I'm gonna help him  er  then I sa , a piece of that bloody great  went across our French doors and  this, there's a  went across"
Cor!
"there  and I went down to the   at    and he said    we got your lintel in mate, do you want to take it?"
"So I said yeah I can do  so he said bring your van down, so I never said nothing  so Bob said, got any  like your dad had"
Oh yeah.
"It's for our new one again you see  so I rolled the front seat down  put my brief case on the front seat  so he says, where's your van then mate?"
I said it's here!
"No, where is it?"
I said that is it!
If ones came as  in little wee pi pickups we called them the little lorry things you would sort of keep your eye very much because you didn't know they were looking for scrap and if you told them you had nothing they might go away with your iron gates or something.
This was during the mid thirties?
Oh yes I would say that yes that was coming more that way yeah yeah.
Coming more that
How about the individual er tramps?
Did you ever have bye-names for these characters?
Well th th there was one Joe Wrench.
Er but I don't know what's that.
But somebody so told me aye and I said that was a funny name or was it else's then.
Well I said I remember a man called Joe Wrench and but er oh I wouldn't er but one  said oh Joe Wrench is very black looking.
Well the bugger is just coming on and he was cleaning the car down hosing her car so he says I turned the hose on him.
Well the hose landed on him alright but it landed on his parcel and it the whole thing fell out on the road.
So there was a bit of
Mm.
among the few people that saw that happening.
But er he was quite a character the man that did that.
Did you ever have an opportunity to to see what the tramps actually carried with them?
No well I could never say I I was kept well away out of the but my father probably might have seen
Mm.
in his bag.
Well I think it would be a change it's when they're when they're when they're jacket would be wet they would have another
Mm.
jacket in the bag.
So whatever he and if he was dumping anything oh er er they would ask the father said er just er to dump that.
They wouldn't be left with a whole pile of stuff or er.
No oh no they or they would dump it in a place where nobody would see it you see.
And when they were coming along Lochassynt were they making for anywhere in particular?
We we well er er see they were on their rounds and then they'd be going round by Nedd and  and probably Scourie they were just doing their circular.
Aye they had their places for.
Yes it's amazing aye.
And did you have ever a chance to gain some sort of insight into their backgrounds?
Who they were in fact?
Any idea what gas might be being produced?
No I was trying to think  it's zinc.
And it's in a basin of hydrogen
Zinc and nitrate.
and it would give off  nitrate wouldn't it?
Zinc nitrate?
Which isn't a gas.
Which isn't a gas.
It's a salt.
So perhaps some odd hydrogen is produced as well.
Well that sometimes happens when there's
Two minutes?
Right.
Yeah I think the two minutes is up.
David's timed two minutes.
Now when that acid is  fresh and hasn't been used before  two minutes is usually quite enough for it to have done the  job it's supposed to do.
"This is an imprecise  operation because  since the acid has been used I don't know how many times  because the temperature, the ambient temperature in the room varies."
"In the winter when it's cold it works more slowly  now when it's very hot it will, should work more quickly."
Er I can't say precisely  leave it in the acid for so and so time.
"So we always  this has always been the case for the four  five hundred years that people have been doing etching, so they go by a rule of thumb."
"The rule of thumb is this  when the first cluster of bubbles is fully formed, sweep them away with a bird's wing feather."
So  I have duly swept them away.
Which means that the acid can get back in there.
"That the air bubble er the gas bubble, I keep saying air bubble, that's wrong."
They are gas bubbles.
The gas bubbles forming along the lines were keeping the acid out of the lines.
So I've swept them away so that the acid can get back in.
When the second set of bubbles is formed  it's done.
That's the rule of thumb.
Okay?
Two formations of bubbles and it's bitten deep enough.
So I suppose that was about two and a half minutes wasn't it?
Well I mean I I know what Barbara feels about this.
"She feels that  erm  at the, the level that we are working at it is really coun be counter productive to hold stock."
Because however hard you try stock deteriorates.
Yeah.
Erm but I you know I feel that that very often we don't sell stock
Well couldn't we just have a few things
and I feel that if we did have stock then  then we would erm  sell it.
So I mean that that's two ways of looking at it.
Certainly if  we've got some stuff in a box
Well I mean we needn't buy the expensive things like sweatshirts
Shall I try at erm Cambridge?
I mean it's October.
"Yeah but they, will they, they won't sell you on at a discount will they?"
Cos if we all
"But I mean I I just know that that Harlow tried stock keeping and selling, they gave up."
I know that er in Hertford they were quite desperate.
All came up with the same idea and they wanted to do it.
And in the end they came to Barbara's conclusions  so that its a an expensive thing.
"But I mean if we only had like the  writing paper and the envelopes and re-use labels, small items of stationery"
the stickers and I mean
they still do  yeah.
"But I mean I I expect, I mean even we had some left over e eventually you could sell them to our own members because they'd all want to use it"
Mm.
and it's cheaper than ordering it off the catalogue.
That's a good idea about Cambridge isn't it?
"You could borrow there stock, is that what you're thinking and then take back what we didn't sell."
That's what
I mean I've never talked to them so I I don't know yet
"Well if they would let us borrow it, that's a different matter to buying it from then because we then wouldn't make any money on it."
"Well I don't, I have never heard of a local group that makes money out of this  selling."
Well you you buy it all at thirty three or twenty five percent discount so you can then sell it at a bit more.
But then you have then you have the stuff that doesn't sell and deteriorates and you still have to have paid for it so
"I I mean I You know, you never make these er  you can get every sort of evasive answer to these questions."
"And they're all lies, you know, they may sound nice and they may deceive people, but the truth is, any politician that I know and respect, when it comes to the crunch, if they think they have a chance of preferment and obviously ultimate preferment, take it."
"Some of them do it sheepishly, and with reluctance and say, It's never what I ever had in mind."
But they always do it.
Others are honest about it.
"Ken Clarke, I like him, I trust him, I admire him."
"What does he say, he answers the question straight, just the way I always answered it."
"Which is to say, yes, given another chance, I'd have a go for it."
"No I no I don't say that, cos what I always said is you cannot do what your friends will never let you do."
That's the real test.
"You cannot If you're in the the House of Commons and there's a vacancy or something of this sort for a job, I mean we don't need to invent a hypothetical situation."
"Your friends are the ones who say, Well you're the guy who could do this."
"And if they don't say that, or if they positively say, You're not the guy, you're wasting your time."
The only reason that you can make progress in that sort of situation is if there's a body of opinion that says that you should.
"But somebody like you could always find friends to say, Yes you ought to do that"
No I don't agree with that.
I d I do not agree with that at all.
"I mean, there could I mean I think the House of Commons is now some way past in in my life in the sense I haven't been there since er June."
"I've no idea about the mood, I've no idea what people will think of er maybe large numbers Well one journalist said to me in Blackpool and perhaps this says it all, he said, Michael, you're the only really popular person here this week."
You see they've nothing to be frightened of any more.
But they're wrong.
Ah but they
"Aren't they because you're saying, I'm still around"
No they may not be wr I I mean the the fact I'm around doesn't mean to say that I'm frightening.
And I haven't changed.
I've never been frightening.
People have misjudged me.
So you're not going to write your memoirs?
"You know, I I I'm I'm unhappy about this memoir business."
"I mean, they're self serving aren't they."
And they're all to to put the person's point of view.
"And erm I I I find it I mean I'm not going to be sort of holier than thou about it all I mean, perhaps I myself might be tempted er one day."
I'm gonna have a  a bowl of water handy just in case.
So having put on these er temporary protective gloves.
These are ones I bought long time ago.
"Erm they're  as you can see, still a bit awkward but much easier to use than these."
What do you think the other piece of protective gear I might need would be?
Goggles.
Goggles.
Good.
And I have a pair of goggles here but there is another safety device built into this which is this window.
"In fact the tray of acid will go in there  so any splashing around I might do, any upward splashing is not likely to reach ."
You will be relieved to know I've ordered some new  rubber gloves like this and some new goggles  for next term.
But you don't need to use them this term anyway so it's alright.
The acid we use is nitric acid.
"It's very very dilute, only fifteen percent acid  the rest is water."
And I have used this particular acid already to etch zinc.
Can't hear you.
Oh.
"I just, I'll just ."
I'll see you later.
Consequently this acid now contains some zinc which has eaten it away.
there'll be a residue of zinc in there.
"The other metal which I mentioned to you before which is the traditional method for  etching is copper, copper plate."
"And I am told that it is not advisable to use the same batch of acid for etching copper as has been used for etching zinc because the  deposits of two metals in the acid creates erm an unpleasant, noxious, possibly poisonous gas and I don't know what that would do."
"Talking about gas, even this produces gas."
Therefore you have this machine which is an extractor.
It's called a  a fume cupboard I think.
A s sort of cupboard.
It's open at the front.
It has to be because we have to get our hands in.
But it's extracting the fumes going out the window.
Possibly not very  ecologically sound but safer for you at all events.
This hasn't been used for some time so it's a bit so I'm just going to wipe it out so  there are no particles or foreign bodies in there.
"Right, that's it, the boat's ready."
So let's go afloat to look at how the basic boat controls work.
Okay Suzanne before you go for your first sail there are a few things you need to learn about basic boat controls.
"The most important control is you, the helms are always set facing the sail."
Yeah.
"And so if you sit just a little bit further forward, that's fine."
Now you steer a boat with a tiller here at the back and you always hold that in the hand nearest it.
Then if we hold this rope in the other hand and effectively that's our accelerator.
That's what pulls in the sail and makes you faster.
Now today because it's a little windy we've rolled up some of the sail out of the way to make it easier for you
Yeah.
and so you could pull it in just until it stops flapping and then you'd be able to sail away and we'd never see you again.
"So before I let you go, I think you ought to learn how to turn the boat around, we call that tacking."
"It's quite a complex manoeuvre and so we'll break it down into the different parts that changing hands, turning the boat around and changing sides."
"Now we'll get the changing hand out of the way first because it's easier that way and so what we do is to bring the rope hand towards the tiller hand and then you can tuck it under your thumb, pick up the tiller with the other hand now, that's fine."
Now we initiate the turn by pushing the tiller away and the next thing to do is wait.
This takes quite a long time and slowly the boat turns around.
"When the boom comes over the top of the boat then you can change sides, sit on the new side, straighten up the tiller and you're sailing away again."
"Oh, that sounds better"
Well we'll try that once more and then we'll let you go.
Okay.
"So the first thing we do is to change hands, that's good, push, wait  change sides, straighten up the tiller, look where you're going  that's fine."
Great.
You're ready to go for your first sail.
Oh.
"Now it's only going to be a short one, just out towards that buoy and when I call you, you can turn round, okay?"
Okay.
Okay come back to me now.
Alright let everything go  fine you've become a sailor.
Now all we've got to do is teach you how to sail.
This is our stable starting position crawl on the .
"The wind is blowing directly across the boat, it's known as the basic  two position."
"`` Oh , thank God , '' murmured Mrs. Blythe , in a half-whisper ."
Bruce looked at her curiously .
`` That is what father said when mother told him .
"But when l said it the other day when I found out Mr. Mead 's dog had n't hurt my kitten -- I thought he had shooken it to death , you know -- father looked awful solemn and said I must never say that again about a kitten ."
"But I could n't understand why , Mrs. Blythe ."
"I felt awful thankful , and it must have been God that saved Stripey , because that Mead dog had ` normous jaws , and oh , how it shook poor Stripey ."
And so why could n't I thank Him ?
"` Course , '' added Bruce reminiscently , `` maybe I said it too loud -- 'cause I was awful glad and excited when I found Stripey was all right ."
"I ` most shouted it , Mrs. Blythe ."
Maybe if I 'd said it sort of whispery like you and father it would have been all right .
"Do you know , Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce dropped to a `` whispery '' tone , edging a little nearer to Anne -- `` what I would like to do to the Kaiser if I could ? ''"
"`` What would you like to do , laddie ? ''"
"`` Norman Reese said in school to-day that he would like to tie the Kaiser to a tree and set cross dogs to worrying him , '' said Bruce gravely ."
`` And Emily Flagg said she would like to put him in a cage and poke sharp things into him .
And they all said things like that .
But Mrs. Blythe '' -- Bruce took a little square paw out of his pocket and put it earnestly on Anne 's knee -- `` I would like to turn the Kaiser into a good man -- a very good man -- all at once if I could .
That is what I would do .
"Do n't you think , Mrs. Blythe , that would be the very worstest punishment of all ? ''"
"`` Bless the child , '' said Susan , `` how do you make out that would be any kind of a punishment for that wicked fiend ? ''"
"`` Do n't you see , '' said Bruce , looking levelly at Susan , out of his blackly blue eyes , `` if he was turned into a good man he would understand how dreadful the things he has done are , and he would feel so terrible about it that he would be more unhappy and miserable than he could ever be in any other way ."
He would feel just awful -- and he would go on feeling like that forever .
"Yes '' -- Bruce clenched his hands and nodded his head emphatically , `` yes , I would make the Kaiser a good man -- that is what I would do -- it would serve him ` zackly right . ''"
"CHAPTER XXVI SUSAN HAS A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE An aeroplane was flying over Glen St. Mary , like a great bird poised against the western sky -- a sky so clear and of such a pale , silvery yellow , that it gave an impression of a vast , wind-freshened space of freedom ."
"The little group on the Ingleside lawn looked up at it with fascinated eyes , although it was by no means an unusual thing to see an occasional hovering plane that summer ."
Susan was always intensely excited .
"Who knew but that it might be Shirley away up there in the clouds , flying over to the Island from Kingsport ?"
"But Shirley had gone overseas now , so Susan was not so keenly interested in this particular aeroplane and its pilot ."
"Nevertheless , she looked at it with awe ."
"`` I wonder , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she said solemnly , `` what the old folks down there in the graveyard would think if they could rise out of their graves for one moment and behold that sight ."
"I am sure my father would disapprove of it , for he was a man who did not believe in new-fangled ideas of any sort ."
He always cut his grain with a reaping hook to the day of his death .
A mower he would not have .
"`` Now , if you make fun of my plan I 'll give you bad coffee for a week , and then where are you , sir ? ''"
"cried Mrs. Jo , tweaking him by the ear just as if he was one of the boys ."
`` Wo n't Daisy 's hair stand erect with horror at Nan 's wild ways ? ''
"asked Mr. Bhaer , presently , when Teddy had swarmed up his waistcoat , and Rob up his back , for they always flew at their father the minute school was done ."
"`` At first , perhaps , but it will do Posy good ."
"She is getting prim and Bettyish , and needs stirring up a bit ."
"She always has a good time when Nan comes over to play , and the two will help each other without knowing it ."
"Dear me , half the science of teaching is knowing how much children do for one another , and when to mix them . ''"
`` I only hope she wo n't turn out another firebrand . ''
`` My poor Dan !
"I never can quite forgive myself for letting him go , '' sighed Mrs. Bhaer ."
"At the sound of the name , little Teddy , who had never forgotten his friend , struggled down from his father 's arms , and trotted to the door , looked out over the sunny lawn with a wistful face , and then trotted back again , saying , as he always did when disappointed of the longed-for sight , `` My Danny 's tummin ' soon . ''"
"`` I really think we ought to have kept him , if only for Teddy 's sake , he was so fond of him , and perhaps baby 's love would have done for him what we failed to do . ''"
"`` I 've sometimes felt that myself ; but after keeping the boys in a ferment , and nearly burning up the whole family , I thought it safer to remove the firebrand , for a time at least , '' said Mr. Bhaer ."
"`` Dinner 's ready , let me ring the bell , '' and Rob began a solo upon that instrument which made it impossible to hear one 's self speak ."
"`` Then I may have Nan , may I ? ''"
asked Mrs. Jo .
"`` A dozen Nans if you want them , my dear , '' answered Mr. Bhaer , who had room in his fatherly heart for all the naughty neglected children in the world ."
"When Mrs. Bhaer returned from her drive that afternoon , before she could unpack the load of little boys , without whom she seldom moved , a small girl of ten skipped out at the back of the carry-all and ran into the house , shouting , `` Hi , Daisy !"
where are you ? ''
"Daisy came , and looked pleased to see her guest , but also a trifle alarmed , when Nan said , still prancing , as if it was impossible to keep still , `` I 'm going to stay here always , papa says I may , and my box is coming tomorrow , all my things had to be washed and mended , and your aunt came and carried me off ."
Is n't it great fun ? ''
"`` Why , yes ."
Did you bring your big doll ? ''
"asked Daisy , hoping she had , for on the last visit Nan had ravaged the baby house , and insisted on washing Blanche Matilda 's plaster face , which spoilt the poor dear 's complexion for ever ."
"`` Yes , she 's somewhere round , '' returned Nan , with most unmaternal carelessness ."
"`` I made you a ring coming along , and pulled the hairs out of Dobbin 's tail ."
Do n't you want it ? ''
"and Nan presented a horse-hair ring in token of friendship , as they had both vowed they would never speak to one another again when they last parted ."
"Won by the beauty of the offering , Daisy grew more cordial , and proposed retiring to the nursery , but Nan said , `` No , I want to see the boys , and the barn , '' and ran off , swinging her hat by one string till it broke , when she left it to its fate on the grass ."
`` Hullo !
Nan ! ''
"`` It is ten o'clock ; into bed , every man of you , '' said Mr. Bhaer , looking at his watch ."
"`` And , thank Heaven !"
"there will be no empty ones to-night , '' added Mrs. Bhaer , watching , with full eyes , Robby going up in his father 's arms , and Nan escorted by Daisy and Demi , who considered her the most interesting heroine of their collection ."
"`` Poor Aunt Jo is so tired she ought to be carried up herself , '' said gentle Franz , putting his arm round her as she paused at the stair-foot , looking quite exhausted by her fright and long walk ."
"`` Let 's make an arm-chair , '' proposed Tommy ."
"`` No , thank you , my lads ; but somebody may lend me a shoulder to lean on , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Me !
me ! ''
"and half-a-dozen jostled one another , all eager to be chosen , for there was something in the pale motherly face that touched the warm hearts under the round jackets ."
"Seeing that they considered it an honor , Mrs. Jo gave it to the one who had earned it , and nobody grumbled when she put her arm on Dan 's broad shoulder , saying , with a look that made him color up with pride and pleasure , `` He found the children ; so I think he must help me up . ''"
"Dan felt richly rewarded for his evening 's work , not only that he was chosen from all the rest to go proudly up bearing the lamp , but because Mrs. Jo said heartily , `` Good-night , my boy !"
God bless you ! ''
as he left her at her door .
"`` I wish I was your boy , '' said Dan , who felt as if danger and trouble had somehow brought him nearer than ever to her ."
"`` You shall be my oldest son , '' and she sealed her promise with a kiss that made Dan hers entirely ."
"Little Rob was all right next day , but Nan had a headache , and lay on Mother Bhaer 's sofa with cold-cream upon her scratched face ."
"Her remorse was quite gone , and she evidently thought being lost rather a fine amusement ."
"Mrs. Jo was not pleased with this state of things , and had no desire to have her children led from the paths of virtue , or her pupils lying round loose in huckleberry fields ."
"So she talked soberly to Nan , and tried to impress upon her mind the difference between liberty and license , telling several tales to enforce her lecture ."
"She had not decided how to punish Nan , but one of these stories suggested a way , and as Mrs. Jo liked odd penalties , she tried it ."
"`` All children run away , '' pleaded Nan , as if it was as natural and necessary a thing as measles or hooping cough ."
"`` Not all , and some who do run away do n't get found again , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
`` Did n't you do it yourself ? ''
"asked Nan , whose keen little eyes saw some traces of a kindred spirit in the serious lady who was sewing so morally before her ."
"Mrs. Jo laughed , and owned that she did ."
"`` Tell about it , '' demanded Nan , feeling that she was getting the upper hand in the discussion ."
"Mrs. Jo saw that , and sobered down at once , saying , with a remorseful shake of the head , `` I did it a good many times , and led my poor mother rather a hard life with my pranks , till she cured me . ''"
`` How ? ''
and Nan sat up with a face full of interest .
"`` I had a new pair of shoes once , and wanted to show them ; so , though I was told not to leave the garden , I ran away and was wandering about all day ."
"It was in the city , and why I was n't killed I do n't know ."
Such a time as I had .
I fondly expected it would turn my hair black -- and it turned it green .
So it had to be cut off . ''
"`` You had a narrow escape , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' exclaimed Susan ."
`` Of course you were too young then to know what a German was .
It was a special mercy of Providence that it was only green dye and not poison . ''
"`` It seems hundreds of years since those Green Gables days , '' sighed Mrs. Blythe ."
`` They belonged to another world altogether .
Life has been cut in two by the chasm of war .
What is ahead I do n't know -- but it ca n't be a bit like the past .
I wonder if those of us who have lived half our lives in the old world will ever feel wholly at home in the new . ''
"`` Have you noticed , '' asked Miss Oliver , glancing up from her book , `` how everything written before the war seems so far away now , too ?"
One feels as if one was reading something as ancient as the Iliad .
This poem of Wordsworth 's -- the Senior class have it in their entrance work -- I 've been glancing over it .
"Its classic calm and repose and the beauty of the lines seem to belong to another planet , and to have as little to do with the present world-welter as the evening star . ''"
"`` The only thing that I find much comfort in reading nowadays is the Bible , '' remarked Susan , whisking her biscuits into the oven ."
`` There are so many passages in it that seem to me exactly descriptive of the Huns .
"Old Highland Sandy declares that there is no doubt that the Kaiser is the Anti-Christ spoken of in Revelations , but I do not go as far as that ."
"It would , in my humble opinion , Mrs. Dr. dear , be too great an honour for him . ''"
"Early one morning , several days later , Miranda Pryor slipped up to Ingleside , ostensibly to get some Red Cross sewing , but in reality to talk over with sympathetic Rilla troubles that were past bearing alone ."
"She brought her dog with her -- an over-fed , bandy-legged little animal very dear to her heart because Joe Milgrave had given it to her when it was a puppy ."
Mr. Pryor regarded all dogs with disfavour ; but in those days he had looked kindly upon Joe as a suitor for Miranda 's hand and so he had allowed her to keep the puppy .
"Miranda was so grateful that she endeavoured to please her father by naming her dog after his political idol , the great Liberal chieftain , Sir Wilfrid Laurier -- though his title was soon abbreviated to Wilfy ."
Sir Wilfrid grew and flourished and waxed fat ; but Miranda spoiled him absurdly and nobody else liked him .
Rilla especially hated him because of his detestable trick of lying flat on his back and entreating you with waving paws to tickle his sleek stomach .
"When she saw that Miranda 's pale eyes bore unmistakable testimony of her having cried all night , Rilla asked her to come up to her room , knowing Miranda had a tale of woe to tell , but she ordered Sir Wilfrid to remain below ."
"`` Oh , ca n't he come , too ? ''"
said Miranda wistfully .
`` Poor Wilfy wo n't be any bother -- and I wiped his paws so carefully before I brought him in .
He is always so lonesome in a strange place without me -- and very soon he 'll be -- all -- I 'll have left -- to remind me -- of Joe . ''
"Rilla yielded , and Sir Wilfrid , with his tail curled at a saucy angle over his brindled back , trotted triumphantly up the stairs before them ."
"`` Oh , Rilla , '' sobbed Miranda , when they had reached sanctuary ."
`` I 'm so unhappy .
"`` Nicely ; she is getting quite mannerly , and begins to see the error of her wild ways . ''"
`` Do n't the boys encourage her in them ? ''
"`` Yes ; but I keep talking , and lately she has improved much ."
"You saw how prettily she shook hands with you , and how gentle she was with Bess ."
"Daisy 's example has its effect upon her , and I 'm quite sure that a few months will work wonders . ''"
"Here Mrs. Jo 's remarks were cut short by the appearance of Nan tearing round the corner at a break-neck pace , driving a mettlesome team of four boys , and followed by Daisy trundling Bess in a wheelbarrow ."
"Hat off , hair flying , whip cracking , and barrow bumping , up they came in a cloud of dust , looking as wild a set of little hoydens as one would wish to see ."
"`` So , these are the model children , are they ?"
"It 's lucky I did n't bring Mrs. Curtis out to see your school for the cultivation of morals and manners ; she would never have recovered from the shock of this spectacle , '' said Mr. Laurie , laughing at Mrs. Jo 's premature rejoicing over Nan 's improvement ."
`` Laugh away ; I 'll succeed yet .
"As you used to say at College , quoting some professor , ` Though the experiment has failed , the principle remains the same , ' '' said Mrs. Bhaer , joining in the merriment ."
"`` I 'm afraid Nan 's example is taking effect upon Daisy , instead of the other way ."
Look at my little princess !
"she has utterly forgotten her dignity , and is screaming like the rest ."
"Young ladies , what does this mean ? ''"
"and Mr. Laurie rescued his small daughter from impending destruction , for the four horses were champing their bits and curvetting madly all about her , as she sat brandishing a great whip in both hands ."
"`` We 're having a race , and I beat , '' shouted Nan ."
"`` I could have run faster , only I was afraid of spilling Bess , '' screamed Daisy ."
`` Hi !
go long ! ''
"cried the princess , giving such a flourish with her whip that the horses ran away , and were seen no more ."
`` My precious child !
come away from this ill-mannered crew before you are quite spoilt .
"Good-by , Jo !"
"Next time I come , I shall expect to find the boys making patchwork . ''"
`` It would n't hurt them a bit .
"I do n't give in , mind you ; for my experiments always fail a few times before they succeed ."
"Love to Amy and my blessed Marmee , '' called Mrs. Jo , as the carriage drove away ; and the last Mr. Laurie saw of her , she was consoling Daisy for her failure by a ride in the wheelbarrow , and looking as if she liked it ."
"Great was the excitement all the week about the repairs in the carriage-house , which went briskly on in spite of the incessant questions , advice , and meddling of the boys ."
"Old Gibbs was nearly driven wild with it all , but managed to do his work nevertheless ; and by Friday night the place was all in order roof mended , shelves up , walls whitewashed , a great window cut at the back , which let in a flood of sunshine , and gave them a fine view of the brook , the meadows , and the distant hills ; and over the great door , painted in red letters , was `` The Laurence Museum . ''"
"All Saturday morning the boys were planning how it should be furnished with their spoils , and when Mr. Laurie arrived , bringing an aquarium which Mrs. Amy said she was tired of , their rapture was great ."
"The afternoon was spent in arranging things , and when the running and lugging and hammering was over , the ladies were invited to behold the institution ."
She picked her steps carefully back with her precious specimens .
The stranger eyed her severely as she stepped on the rocks .
"`` I should think you would have more sense than to risk your life in that fashion for a handful of seaweeds , '' he said ."
"`` I have n't the faintest idea what you mean , '' said Miss Rangely ."
"`` You do n't look crazy , but you talk as if you were . ''"
`` Do you mean to say you do n't know that what the people hereabouts call the Bottomless Pit is situated right off that point -- the most dangerous spot along the whole coast ? ''
"`` No , I did n't , '' said Katherine , horrified ."
"She remembered now that Aunt Elizabeth had warned her to be careful of some bad hole along shore , but she had not been paying much attention and had supposed it to be in quite another direction ."
`` I am a stranger here . ''
"`` Well , I hardly thought you 'd be foolish enough to be out there if you knew , '' said the other in mollified accents ."
"`` The place ought not to be left without warning , anyhow ."
It is the most careless thing I ever heard of .
There is a big hole right off that point and nobody has ever been able to find the bottom of it .
A person who got into it would never be heard of again .
The rocks there form an eddy that sucks everything right down . ''
"`` I am very grateful to you for calling me in , '' said Katherine humbly ."
`` I had no idea I was in such danger . ''
"`` You have a very fine bunch of seaweeds , I see , '' said the unknown ."
But Katherine was in no mood to converse on seaweeds .
"She suddenly realized what she must look like -- bare feet , draggled skirts , dripping arms ."
And this creature whom she had taken for a lunatic was undoubtedly a gentleman .
"Oh , if he would only go and give her a chance to put on her shoes and stockings !"
Nothing seemed further from his intentions .
"When Katherine had picked up the aforesaid articles and turned homeward , he walked beside her , still discoursing on seaweeds as eloquently as if he were commonly accustomed to walking with barefooted young women ."
"In spite of herself , Katherine could n't help listening to him , for he managed to invest seaweeds with an absorbing interest ."
"She finally decided that as he did n't seem to mind her bare feet , she would n't either ."
He knew so much about seaweeds that Katherine felt decidedly amateurish beside him .
He looked over her specimens and pointed out the valuable ones .
"He explained the best method of preserving and mounting them , and told her of other and less dangerous places along the shore where she might get some new varieties ."
"When they came in sight of Harbour Hill , Katherine began to wonder what on earth she would do with him ."
"It was n't exactly permissible to snub a man who had practically saved your life , but , on the other hand , the prospect of walking through the principal street of Harbour Hill barefooted and escorted by a scholarly looking gentleman discoursing on seaweeds was not to be calmly contemplated ."
The unknown cut the Gordian knot himself .
"Dick told him his name , and presented Lord Foxham 's signet , which the duke immediately recognised ."
"`` Ye come too soon , '' he said ; `` but why should I complain ?"
"Ye are like me , that was here at watch two hours before the day ."
"But this is the first sally of mine arms ; upon this adventure , Master Shelton , shall I make or mar the quality of my renown ."
"There lie mine enemies , under two old , skilled captains -- Risingham and Brackley -- well posted for strength , I do believe , but yet upon two sides without retreat , enclosed betwixt the sea , the harbour , and the river ."
"Methinks , Shelton , here were a great blow to be stricken , an we could strike it silently and suddenly . ''"
"`` I do think so , indeed , '' cried Dick , warming ."
`` Have ye my Lord Foxham 's notes ? ''
inquired the duke .
"And then , Dick , having explained how he was without them for the moment , made himself bold to offer information every jot as good , of his own knowledge ."
"`` And for mine own part , my lord duke , '' he added , `` an ye had men enough , I would fall on even at this present ."
"For , look ye , at the peep of day the watches of the night are over ; but by day they keep neither watch nor ward -- only scour the outskirts with horsemen ."
"Now , then , when the night watch is already unarmed , and the rest are at their morning cup -- now were the time to break them . ''"
`` How many do ye count ? ''
asked Gloucester .
"`` They number not two thousand , '' Dick replied ."
"`` I have seven hundred in the woods behind us , '' said the duke ; `` seven hundred follow from Kettley , and will be here anon ; behind these , and further , are four hundred more ; and my Lord Foxham hath five hundred half a day from here , at Holywood ."
"Shall we attend their coming , or fall on ? ''"
"`` My lord , '' said Dick , `` when ye hanged these five poor rogues ye did decide the question ."
"Churls although they were , in these uneasy , times they will be lacked and looked for , and the alarm be given ."
"Therefore , my lord , if ye do count upon the advantage of a surprise , ye have not , in my poor opinion , one whole hour in front of you . ''"
"`` I do think so indeed , '' returned Crookback ."
"`` Well , before an hour , ye shall be in the thick o n't , winning spurs ."
"A swift man to Holywood , carrying Lord Foxham 's signet ; another along the road to speed my laggards !"
"Nay , Shelton , by the rood , it may be done ! ''"
Therewith he once more set his trumpet to his lips and blew .
This time he was not long kept waiting .
In a moment the open space about the cross was filled with horse and foot .
"Richard of Gloucester took his place upon the steps , and despatched messenger after messenger to hasten the concentration of the seven hundred men that lay hidden in the immediate neighbourhood among the woods ; and before a quarter of an hour had passed , all his dispositions being taken , he put himself at their head , and began to move down the hill towards Shoreby ."
His plan was simple .
"He was to seize a quarter of the town of Shoreby lying on the right hand of the high road , and make his position good there in the narrow lanes until his reinforcements followed ."
"If Lord Risingham chose to retreat , Richard would follow upon his rear , and take him between two fires ; or , if he preferred to hold the town , he would be shut in a trap , there to be gradually overwhelmed by force of numbers ."
Excuse me for a moment . ''
"Rilla flew upstairs , wishing quite frankly that soup tureens had never been invented ."
"But when Jims , at sight of her , lifted his little arms entreatingly and swallowed several sobs , with tears rolling down his cheeks , resentment went out of her heart ."
"After all , the poor darling was frightened ."
She picked him up gently and rocked him soothingly until his sobs ceased and his eyes closed .
Then she essayed to lay him down in his crib .
Jims opened his eyes and shrieked a protest .
This performance was repeated twice .
Rilla grew desperate .
She could n't leave Ken down there alone any longer -- she had been away nearly half an hour already .
"With a resigned air she marched downstairs , carrying Jims , and sat down on the veranda ."
"It was , no doubt , a ridiculous thing to sit and cuddle a contrary war-baby when your best young man was making his farewell call , but there was nothing else to be done ."
Jims was supremely happy .
He kicked his little pink-soled feet rapturously out under his white nighty and gave one of his rare laughs .
He was beginning to be a very pretty baby ; his golden hair curled in silken ringlets all over his little round head and his eyes were beautiful .
"`` He 's a decorative kiddy all right , is n't he ? ''"
said Ken .
"`` His looks are very well , '' said Rilla , bitterly , as if to imply that they were much the best of him ."
"Jims , being an astute infant , sensed trouble in the atmosphere and realized that it was up to him to clear it away ."
"He turned his face up to Rilla , smiled adorably and said , clearly and beguilingly , `` Will -- Will . ''"
It was the very first time he had spoken a word or tried to speak .
Rilla was so delighted that she forgot her grudge against him .
She forgave him with a hug and kiss .
"Jims , understanding that he was restored to favour , cuddled down against her just where a gleam of light from the lamp in the living-room struck across his hair and turned it into a halo of gold against her breast ."
"Kenneth sat very still and silent , looking at Rilla -- at the delicate , girlish silhouette of her , her long lashes , her dented lip , her adorable chin ."
"In the dim moonlight , as she sat with her head bent a little over Jims , the lamplight glinting on her pearls until they glistened like a slender nimbus , he thought she looked exactly like the Madonna that hung over his mother 's desk at home ."
He carried that picture of her in his heart to the horror of the battlefields of France .
"He had had a strong fancy for Rilla Blythe ever since the night of the Four Winds dance ; but it was when he saw her there , with little Jims in her arms , that he loved her and realized it ."
"And all the while , poor Rilla was sitting , disappointed and humiliated , feeling that her last evening with Ken was spoiled and wondering why things always had to go so contrarily outside of books ."
She felt too absurd to try to talk .
"Evidently Ken was completely disgusted , too , since he was sitting there in such stony silence ."
Hope revived momentarily when Jims went so thoroughly asleep that she thought it would be safe to lay him down on the couch in the living-room .
"Let him alone , and it will all come out soon enough , '' answered Frank , who laughed at his brother , but loved him none the less for the tender heart that often got the better of his young head ."
"But for once Frank was mistaken ; the mystery did not come out , and Jack worked like a beaver all that week , as orders poured in when Jill and Annette showed their elegant cards ; for , as everybody knows , if one girl has a new thing all the rest must , whether it is a bow on the top of her head , a peculiar sort of pencil , or the latest kind of chewing-gum ."
"Little play did the poor fellow get , for every spare minute was spent at the press , and no invitation could tempt him away , so much in earnest was our honest little Franklin about paying his debt ."
"Jill helped all she could , and cheered his labors with her encouragement , remembering how he stayed at home for her ."
"`` It is real good of you to lend a hand , and I 'm ever so much obliged , '' said Jack , as the last order was struck off , and the drawer of the type-box held a pile of shining five and ten cent pieces , with two or three quarters ."
"`` I love to ; only it would be nicer if I knew what we were working for , '' she said demurely , as she scattered type for the last time ; and seeing that Jack was both tired and grateful , hoped to get a hint of the secret ."
"`` I want to tell you , dreadfully ; but I ca n't , because I 've promised . ''"
"`` What , never ? ''"
`` Never ! ''
and Jack looked as firm as a rock .
"`` Then I shall find out , for I have n't promised . ''"
`` You ca n't . ''
`` See if I do n't ! ''
"`` You are sharp , but you wo n't guess this ."
"It 's a tremendous secret , and nobody will tell it . ''"
`` You 'll tell it yourself .
You always do . ''
`` I wo n't tell this .
It would be mean . ''
"`` Wait and see ; I can get anything out of you if I try ; '' and Jill laughed , knowing her power well , for Jack found it very hard to keep a secret from her ."
`` Do n't try ; please do n't !
"It would n't be right , and you do n't want to make me do a dishonorable thing for your sake , I know . ''"
"Jack looked so distressed that Jill promised not to make him tell , though she held herself free to find out in other ways , if she could ."
"Thus relieved , Jack trudged off to school on Friday with the two dollars and seventy-five cents jingling in his pocket , though the dear gold coin had to be sacrificed to make up the sum ."
"He did his lessons badly that day , was late at recess in the afternoon , and , as soon as school was over , departed in his rubber boots `` to take a walk , '' he said , though the roads were in a bad state with a spring thaw ."
"Nothing was seen of him till after tea-time , when he came limping in , very dirty and tired , but with a reposeful expression , which betrayed that a load was off his mind ."
"Frank was busy about his own affairs and paid little attention to him , but Jill was on tenter-hooks to know where he had been , yet dared not ask the question ."
`` Merry 's brother wants some cards .
He liked hers so much he wishes to make his lady-love a present .
"Here 's the name ; '' and Jill held up the order from Harry Grant , who was to be married in the autumn ."
`` Must wait till next week .
"I 'm too tired to do a thing to-night , and I hate the sight of that old press , '' answered Jack , laying himself down upon the rug as if every joint ached ."
"One by one all the kites went up , and floated far overhead like gay birds , balancing themselves on the fresh breeze that blew steadily over the hill ."
Such a merry time as they had !
"running and shouting , sending up the kites or pulling them down , watching their antics in the air , and feeling them tug at the string like live creatures trying to escape ."
"Nan was quite wild with the fun , Daisy thought the new play nearly as interesting as dolls , and little Bess was so fond of her `` boo tite , '' that she would only let it go on very short flights , preferring to hold it in her lap and look at the remarkable pictures painted on it by Tommy 's dashing brush ."
"Mrs. Jo enjoyed hers immensely , and it acted as if it knew who owned it , for it came tumbling down head first when least expected , caught on trees , nearly pitched into the river , and finally darted away to such a height that it looked a mere speck among the clouds ."
"By and by every one got tired , and fastening the kite-strings to trees and fences , all sat down to rest , except Mr. Bhaer , who went off to look at the cows , with Teddy on his shoulder ."
`` Did you ever have such a good time as this before ? ''
"asked Nat , as they lay about on the grass , nibbling pennyroyal like a flock of sheep ."
"`` Not since I last flew a kite , years ago , when I was a girl , '' answered Mrs. Jo ."
"`` I 'd like to have known you when you were a girl , you must have been so jolly , '' said Nat ."
"`` I was a naughty little girl , I am sorry to say . ''"
"`` I like naughty little girls , '' observed Tommy , looking at Nan , who made a frightful grimace at him in return for the compliment ."
"`` Why do n't I remember you then , Aunty ?"
Was I too young ? ''
asked Demi .
"`` Rather , dear . ''"
`` I suppose my memory had n't come then .
"Grandpa says that different parts of the mind unfold as we grow up , and the memory part of my mind had n't unfolded when you were little , so I ca n't remember how you looked , '' explained Demi ."
"`` Now , little Socrates , you had better keep that question for grandpa , it is beyond me , '' said Aunt Jo , putting on the extinguisher ."
"`` Well , I will , he knows about those things , and you do n't , '' returned Demi , feeling that on the whole kites were better adapted to the comprehension of the present company ."
"`` Tell about the last time you flew a kite , '' said Nat , for Mrs. Jo had laughed as she spoke of it , and he thought it might be interesting ."
"`` Oh , it was only rather funny , for I was a great girl of fifteen , and was ashamed to be seen at such a play ."
"So Uncle Teddy and I privately made our kites , and stole away to fly them ."
"We had a capital time , and were resting as we are now , when suddenly we heard voices , and saw a party of young ladies and gentlemen coming back from a picnic ."
"Teddy did not mind , though he was rather a large boy to be playing with a kite , but I was in a great flurry , for I knew I should be sadly laughed at , and never hear the last of it , because my wild ways amused the neighbors as much as Nan 's do us . ''"
` What shall I do ? '
"I whispered to Teddy , as the voices drew nearer and nearer . ''"
"` I 'll show you , ' he said , and whipping out his knife he cut the strings ."
"Away flew the kites , and when the people came up we were picking flowers as properly as you please ."
"They never suspected us , and we had a grand laugh over our narrow escape . ''"
"`` Were the kites lost , Aunty ? ''"
asked Daisy .
"CHAPTER I PETER BREAKS THROUGH All children , except one , grow up ."
"They soon know that they will grow up , and the way Wendy knew was this ."
"One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden , and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother ."
"I suppose she must have looked rather delightful , for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried , ` Oh , why ca n't you remain like this for ever ! '"
"This was all that passed between them on the subject , but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up ."
You always know after you are two .
Two is the beginning of the end .
"Of course they lived at 14 , and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one ."
"She was a lovely lady , with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth ."
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes , one within the other , that come from the puzzling East , however many you discover there is always one more ; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get , though there it was , perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner ."
"The way Mr. Darling won her was this : the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her , and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling , who took a cab and nipped in first , and so he got her ."
"He got all of her , except the innermost box and the kiss ."
"He never knew about the box , and in time he gave up trying for the kiss ."
"Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it , but I can picture him trying , and then going off in a passion , slamming the door ."
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him .
He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares .
"Of course no one really knows , but he quite seemed to know , and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him ."
"Mrs. Darling was married in white , and at first she kept the books perfectly , almost gleefully , as if it were a game , not so much as a brussels sprout was missing ; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out , and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces ."
She drew them when she should have been totting up .
They were Mrs. Darling 's guesses .
"Wendy came first , then John , then Michael ."
"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her , as she was another mouth to feed ."
"Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her , but he was very honourable , and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling 's bed , holding her hand and calculating expenses , while she looked at him imploringly ."
"She wanted to risk it , come what might , but that was not his way ; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper , and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again ."
"` Now do n't interrupt , ' he would beg of her . '"
"I have one pound seventeen here , and two and six at the office ; I can cut off my coffee at the office , say ten shillings , making two nine and six , with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven , with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven , -- who is that moving ?"
"-- eight nine seven , dot and carry seven -- do n't speak , my own -- and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door -- quiet , child -- dot and carry child -- there , you 've done it !"
-- did I say nine nine seven ?
"yes , I said nine nine seven ; the question is , can we try it for a year on nine nine seven ? '"
"` Of course we can , George , ' she cried ."
"But she was prejudiced in Wendy 's favour , and he was really the grander character of the two ."
"` Remember mumps , ' he warned her almost threateningly , and off he went again ."
It was Peter 's cockiness .
"This had got on Hook 's nerves ; it made his iron claw twitch , and at night it disturbed him like an insect ."
"While Peter lived , the tortured man felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come ."
"The question now was how to get down the trees , or how to get his dogs down ?"
"He ran his greedy eyes over them , searching for the thinnest ones ."
"They wriggled uncomfortably , for they knew he would not scruple -LSB- hesitate -RSB- to ram them down with poles ."
"In the meantime , what of the boys ?"
"We have seen them at the first clang of the weapons , turned as it were into stone figures , open-mouthed , all appealing with outstretched arms to Peter ; and we return to them as their mouths close , and their arms fall to their sides ."
"The pandemonium above has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose , passed like a fierce gust of wind ; but they know that in the passing it has determined their fate ."
Which side had won ?
"The pirates , listening avidly at the mouths of the trees , heard the question put by every boy , and alas , they also heard Peter 's answer ."
"`` If the redskins have won , '' he said , `` they will beat the tom-tom ; it is always their sign of victory . ''"
"Now Smee had found the tom-tom , and was at that moment sitting on it ."
"`` You will never hear the tom-tom again , '' he muttered , but inaudibly of course , for strict silence had been enjoined -LSB- urged -RSB- ."
"To his amazement Hook signed him to beat the tom-tom , and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order ."
"Never , probably , had this simple man admired Hook so much ."
"Twice Smee beat upon the instrument , and then stopped to listen gleefully ."
"`` The tom-tom , '' the miscreants heard Peter cry ; `` an Indian victory ! ''"
"The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black hearts above , and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter ."
"This puzzled the pirates , but all their other feelings were swallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the trees ."
They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands .
"Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders : one man to each tree , and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yards apart ."
Chapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES ?
The more quickly this horror is disposed of the better .
The first to emerge from his tree was Curly .
"He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco , who flung him to Smee , who flung him to Starkey , who flung him to Bill Jukes , who flung him to Noodler , and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at the feet of the black pirate ."
"All the boys were plucked from their trees in this ruthless manner ; and several of them were in the air at a time , like bales of goods flung from hand to hand ."
"A different treatment was accorded to Wendy , who came last ."
"With ironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her , and , offering her his arm , escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged ."
"He did it with such an air , he was so frightfully DISTINGUE -LSB- imposingly distinguished -RSB- , that she was too fascinated to cry out ."
She was only a little girl .
"Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her , and we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results ."
"We can count , I take it , on your own home servants , Mr. Trelawney ? ''"
"`` As upon myself , '' declared the squire ."
"`` Three , '' reckoned the captain ; `` ourselves make seven , counting Hawkins here ."
"Now , about the honest hands ? ''"
"`` Most likely Trelawney 's own men , '' said the doctor ; `` those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver . ''"
"`` Nay , '' replied the squire ."
`` Hands was one of mine . ''
"`` I did think I could have trusted Hands , '' added the captain ."
`` And to think that they 're all Englishmen ! ''
broke out the squire .
"`` Sir , I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up . ''"
"`` Well , gentlemen , '' said the captain , `` the best that I can say is not much ."
"We must lay to , if you please , and keep a bright lookout ."
"It 's trying on a man , I know ."
It would be pleasanter to come to blows .
But there 's no help for it till we know our men .
"Lay to , and whistle for a wind , that 's my view . ''"
"`` Jim here , '' said the doctor , `` can help us more than anyone ."
"The men are not shy with him , and Jim is a noticing lad . ''"
"`` Hawkins , I put prodigious faith in you , '' added the squire ."
"I began to feel pretty desperate at this , for I felt altogether helpless ; and yet , by an odd train of circumstances , it was indeed through me that safety came ."
"In the meantime , talk as we pleased , there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely ; and out of these seven one was a boy , so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen ."
PART THREE -- My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed .
"Although the breeze had now utterly ceased , we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast ."
Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface .
"This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands , and by many tall trees of the pine family , out-topping the others -- some singly , some in clumps ; but the general colouring was uniform and sad ."
The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock .
"All were strangely shaped , and the Spy-glass , which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island , was likewise the strangest in configuration , running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on ."
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell .
"The booms were tearing at the blocks , the rudder was banging to and fro , and the whole ship creaking , groaning , and jumping like a manufactory ."
"I had to cling tight to the backstay , and the world turned giddily before my eyes , for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on , this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so , above all in the morning , on an empty stomach ."
"Perhaps it was this -- perhaps it was the look of the island , with its grey , melancholy woods , and wild stone spires , and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach -- at least , although the sun shone bright and hot , and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us , and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea , my heart sank , as the saying is , into my boots ; and from the first look onward , I hated the very thought of Treasure Island ."
"I know that Jem and Jerry are in the trenches -- that Ken and Walter will be soon -- that if one of them does not come back my heart will break -- yet I go on and work and plan -- yes , and even enjoy life by times ."
"There are moments when we have real fun because , just for the moment , we do n't think about things and then -- we remember -- and the remembering is worse than thinking of it all the time would have been ."
"`` Today was dark and cloudy and tonight is wild enough , as Gertrude says , to please any novelist in search of suitable matter for a murder or elopement ."
"The raindrops streaming over the panes look like tears running down a face , and the wind is shrieking through the maple grove ."
`` This has n't been a nice Christmas Day in any way .
"Nan had toothache and Susan had red eyes , and assumed a weird and gruesome flippancy of manner to deceive us into thinking she had n't ; and Jims had a bad cold all day and I 'm afraid of croup ."
He has had croup twice since October .
"The first time I was nearly frightened to death , for father and mother were both away -- father always is away , it seems to me , when any of this household gets sick ."
"But Susan was cool as a fish and knew just what to do , and by morning Jims was all right ."
That child is a cross between a duck and an imp .
"He 's a year and four months old , trots about everywhere , and says quite a few words ."
He has the cutest little way of calling me `` Willa-will . ''
"It always brings back that dreadful , ridiculous , delightful night when Ken came to say good-bye , and I was so furious and happy ."
Jims is pink and white and big-eyed and curly-haired and every now and then I discover a new dimple in him .
"I can never quite believe he is really the same creature as that scrawny , yellow , ugly little changeling I brought home in the soup tureen ."
Nobody has ever heard a word from Jim Anderson .
If he never comes back I shall keep Jims always .
Everybody here worships and spoils him -- or would spoil him if Morgan and I did n't stand remorselessly in the way .
Susan says Jims is the cleverest child she ever saw and can recognize Old Nick when he sees him -- this because Jims threw poor Doc out of an upstairs window one day .
"Doc turned into Mr. Hyde on his way down and landed in a currant bush , spitting and swearing ."
"I tried to console his inner cat with a saucer of milk but he would have none of it , and remained Mr. Hyde the rest of the day ."
Jims 's latest exploit was to paint the cushion of the big arm-chair in the sun parlour with molasses ; and before anybody found it out Mrs. Fred Clow came in on Red Cross business and sat down on it .
Her new silk dress was ruined and nobody could blame her for being vexed .
"But she went into one of her tempers and said nasty things and gave me such slams about ` spoiling ' Jims that I nearly boiled over , too ."
But I kept the lid on till she had waddled away and then I exploded . ''
"` The fat , clumsy , horrid old thing , ' I said -- and oh , what a satisfaction it was to say it . ''"
"` She has three sons at the front , ' mother said rebukingly . '' '"
"I suppose that covers all her shortcomings in manners , ' I retorted ."
But I was ashamed -- for it is true that all her boys have gone and she was very plucky and loyal about it too ; and she is a perfect tower of strength in the Red Cross .
It 's a little hard to remember all the heroines .
"Just the same , it was her second new silk dress in one year and that when everybody is -- or should be -- trying to ` save and serve . '"
`` I had to bring out my green velvet hat again lately and begin wearing it .
Isaac was a well-to-do old bachelor who had never had any notion of getting married until his sister died in the winter .
"And then , as soon as the spring planting was over , he began to look round for a wife ."
He came to me first and I said `` No '' good and hard .
"I liked Isaac well enough ; but I was snug and comfortable , and did n't feel like pulling up my roots and moving into another lot ; besides , Isaac 's courting seemed to me a shade too business-like ."
I ca n't get along without a little romance ; it 's my nature .
"Isaac was disappointed and said so , but intimated that it was n't crushing and that the next best would do very well ."
"The next best was Melissa , and he proposed to her after the decent interval of a fortnight ."
Melissa also refused him .
"I admit I was surprised at this , for I knew Melissa was rather anxious to marry ; but she has always been down on Isaac Appleby , from principle , because of a family feud on her mother 's side ; besides , an old beau of hers , a widower at Kingsbridge , was just beginning to take notice again , and I suspected Melissa had hopes concerning him ."
"Finally , I imagine Melissa did not fancy being second choice ."
"Whatever her reasons were , she refused poor Isaac , and that finished his matrimonial prospects as far as Jersey Cove was concerned , for there was n't another eligible woman in it -- that is , for a man of Isaac 's age ."
"I was the only widow , and the other old maids besides Melissa were all hopelessly old-maiden ."
"This was all three months ago , and Isaac had been keeping house for himself ever since ."
"Nobody knew much about how he got along , for the Appleby house is half a mile from anywhere , down near the shore at the end of a long lane -- the lonesomest place , as I did not fail to remember when I was considering Isaac 's offer ."
"`` I heard Jarvis Aldrich say Isaac had got a dog lately , '' said Melissa , when we finally came in sight of the house -- a handsome new one , by the way , put up only ten years ago ."
`` Jarvis said it was an imported breed .
I do hope it is n't cross . ''
"I have a mortal horror of dogs , and I followed Melissa into the big farmyard with fear and trembling ."
"We were halfway across the yard when Melissa shrieked : `` Anne , there 's the dog ! ''"
"There was the dog ; and the trouble was that he did n't stay there , but came right down the slope at a steady , business-like trot ."
"He was a bull-dog and big enough to bite a body clean in two , and he was the ugliest thing in dogs I had ever seen ."
Melissa and I both lost our heads .
"We screamed , dropped our parasols , and ran instinctively to the only refuge that was in sight -- a ladder leaning against the old Appleby house ."
"I am forty-five and something more than plump , so that climbing ladders is not my favorite form of exercise ."
But I went up that one with the agility and grace of sixteen .
"Melissa followed me , and we found ourselves on the roof -- fortunately it was a flat one -- panting and gasping , but safe , unless that diabolical dog could climb a ladder ."
I crept cautiously to the edge and peered over .
"The beast was sitting on his haunches at the foot of the ladder , and it was quite evident he was not short on time ."
The gleam in his eye seemed to say : `` I 've got you two unprincipled subscription hunters beautifully treed and it 's treed you 're going to stay .
That is what I call satisfying . ''
I reported the state of the case to Melissa .
`` What shall we do ? ''
"But Dick still stood irresolute ; he was yet young to the more deplorable necessities of war , and the thought of old Lady Brackley checked the command upon his tongue ."
His own men became restive .
"Some of them cried on him by name ; others , of their own accord , began to shoot ; and at the first discharge poor Bennet bit the dust ."
Then Dick awoke .
`` On ! ''
he cried .
"`` Shoot , boys , and keep to cover ."
England and York ! ''
"But just then the dull beat of many horses on the snow suddenly arose in the hollow ear of the night , and , with incredible swiftness , drew nearer and swelled louder ."
"At the same time , answering tuckets repeated and repeated Hatch 's call ."
"`` Rally , rally ! ''"
cried Dick .
`` Rally upon me !
Rally for your lives ! ''
"But his men -- afoot , scattered , taken in the hour when they had counted on an easy triumph -- began instead to give ground severally , and either stood wavering or dispersed into the thickets ."
"And when the first of the horsemen came charging through the open avenues and fiercely riding their steeds into the underwood , a few stragglers were overthrown or speared among the brush , but the bulk of Dick 's command had simply melted at the rumour of their coming ."
"Dick stood for a moment , bitterly recognising the fruits of his precipitate and unwise valour ."
"Sir Daniel had seen the fire ; he had moved out with his main force , whether to attack his pursuers or to take them in the rear if they should venture the assault ."
His had been throughout the part of a sagacious captain ; Dick 's the conduct of an eager boy .
"And here was the young knight , his sweetheart , indeed , holding him tightly by the hand , but otherwise alone , his whole command of men and horses dispersed in the night and the wide forest , like a paper of pins in a bay barn ."
`` The saints enlighten me ! ''
he thought .
`` It is well I was knighted for this morning 's matter ; this doth me little honour . ''
"And thereupon , still holding Joanna , he began to run ."
"The silence of the night was now shattered by the shouts of the men of Tunstall , as they galloped hither and thither , hunting fugitives ; and Dick broke boldly through the underwood and ran straight before him like a deer ."
"The silver clearness of the moon upon the open snow increased , by contrast , the obscurity of the thickets ; and the extreme dispersion of the vanquished led the pursuers into wildly divergent paths ."
"Hence , in but a little while , Dick and Joanna paused , in a close covert , and heard the sounds of the pursuit , scattering abroad , indeed , in all directions , but yet fainting already in the distance ."
"`` An I had but kept a reserve of them together , '' Dick cried , bitterly , `` I could have turned the tables yet !"
"Well , we live and learn ; next time it shall go better , by the rood . ''"
"`` Nay , Dick , '' said Joanna , `` what matters it ?"
Here we are together once again . ''
"He looked at her , and there she was -- John Matcham , as of yore , in hose and doublet ."
"In ten minutes , Mr. Bhaer and Silas were off to the wood , and Franz tearing down the road on old Andy to search the great pasture ."
"Mrs. Jo caught up some food from the table , a little bottle of brandy from the medicine-closet , took a lantern , and bidding Jack and Emil come with her , and the rest not stir , she trotted away on Toby , never stopping for hat or shawl ."
"She heard some one running after her , but said not a word till , as she paused to call and listen , the light of her lantern shone on Dan 's face ."
`` You here !
"I told Jack to come , '' she said , half-inclined to send him back , much as she needed help ."
"`` I would n't let him ; he and Emil had n't had any supper , and I wanted to come more than they did , '' he said , taking the lantern from her and smiling up in her face with the steady look in his eyes that made her feel as if , boy though he was , she had some one to depend on ."
"Off she jumped , and ordered him on to Toby , in spite of his pleading to walk ; then they went on again along the dusty , solitary road , stopping every now and then to call and hearken breathlessly for little voices to reply ."
"When they came to the great pasture , other lights were already flitting to and fro like will-o ' - the-wisps , and Mr. Bhaer 's voice was heard shouting , `` Nan !"
Rob !
Rob !
Nan ! ''
in every part of the field .
"Silas whistled and roared , Dan plunged here and there on Toby , who seemed to understand the case , and went over the roughest places with unusual docility ."
"Often Mrs. Jo hushed them all , saying , with a sob in her throat , `` The noise may frighten them , let me call ; Robby will know my voice ; '' and then she would cry out the beloved little name in every tone of tenderness , till the very echoes whispered it softly , and the winds seemed to waft it willingly ; but still no answer came ."
"The sky was overcast now , and only brief glimpses of the moon were seen , heat-lightening darted out of the dark clouds now and then , and a faint far-off rumble as of thunder told that a summer-storm was brewing ."
`` O my Robby !
my Robby ! ''
"mourned poor Mrs. Jo , wandering up and down like a pale ghost , while Dan kept beside her like a faithful fire-fly ."
`` What shall I say to Nan 's father if she comes to harm ?
Why did I ever trust my darling so far away ?
"Fritz , do you hear any thing ? ''"
"and when a mournful , `` No '' came back , she wrung her hands so despairingly that Dan sprung down from Toby 's back , tied the bridle to the bars , and said , in his decided way , `` They may have gone down the spring I 'm going to look . ''"
"He was over the wall and away so fast that she could hardly follow him ; but when she reached the spot , he lowered the lantern and showed her with joy the marks of little feet in the soft ground about the spring ."
"She fell down on her knees to examine the tracks , and then sprung up , saying eagerly , `` Yes ; that is the mark of my Robby 's little boots !"
"Come this way , they must have gone on . ''"
Such a weary search !
"But now some inexplicable instinct seemed to lead the anxious mother , for presently Dan uttered a cry , and caught up a little shining object lying in the path ."
"It was the cover of the new tin pail , dropped in the first alarm of being lost ."
"Mrs. Jo hugged and kissed it as if it were a living thing ; and when Dan was about to utter a glad shout to bring the others to the spot , she stopped him , saying , as she hurried on , `` No , let me find them ; I let Rob go , and I want to give him back to his father all myself . ''"
"A little farther on Nan 's hat appeared , and after passing the place more than once , they came at last upon the babes in the wood , both sound asleep ."
Dan never forgot the little picture on which the light of his lantern shone that night .
"He thought Mrs. Jo would cry out , but she only whispered , `` Hush ! ''"
"Stuffy was observed to offer her frequent sucks on his candy-ball during the game , which evidently sweetened her temper , for the last thing she said on going to bed was , `` When my battledore and shuttle-cock comes , I 'll let you all play with 'em . ''"
Her first remark in the morning was `` Has my box come ? ''
"and when told that it would arrive sometime during the day , she fretted and fumed , and whipped her doll , till Daisy was shocked ."
"She managed to exist , however , till five o'clock , when she disappeared , and was not missed till supper-time , because those at home thought she had gone to the hill with Tommy and Demi ."
"`` I saw her going down the avenue alone as hard as she could pelt , '' said Mary Ann , coming in with the hasty-pudding , and finding every one asking , `` Where is Nan ? ''"
"`` She has run home , little gypsy ! ''"
"cried Mrs. Bhaer , looking anxious ."
"`` Perhaps she has gone to the station to look after her luggage , '' suggested Franz ."
"`` That is impossible , she does not know the way , and if she found it , she could never carry the box a mile , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , beginning to think that her new idea might be rather a hard one to carry out ."
"`` It would be like her , '' and Mr. Bhaer caught up his hat to go and find the child , when a shout from Jack , who was at the window , made everyone hurry to the door ."
"There was Miss Nan , to be sure , tugging along a very large band-box tied up in linen bag ."
"Very hot and dusty and tired did she look , but marched stoutly along , and came puffing up to the steps , where she dropped her load with a sigh of relief , and sat down upon it , observed as she crossed her tired arms , `` I could n't wait any longer , so I went and got it . ''"
"`` But you did not know the way , '' said Tommy , while the rest stood round enjoying the joke ."
"`` Oh , I found it , I never get lost . ''"
"`` It 's a mile , how could you go so far ? ''"
"`` Well , it was pretty far , but I rested a good deal . ''"
`` Was n't that thing very heavy ? ''
"`` It 's so round , I could n't get hold of it good , and I thought my arms would break right off . ''"
"`` I do n't see how the station-master let you have it , '' said Tommy ."
`` I did n't say anything to him .
"He was in the little ticket place , and did n't see me , so I just took it off the platform . ''"
"`` Run down and tell him it is all right , Franz , or old Dodd will think it is stolen , '' said Mr. Bhaer , joining in the shout of laughter at Nan 's coolness ."
`` I told you we would send for it if it did not come .
"Another time you must wait , for you will get into trouble if you run away ."
"Promise me this , or I shall not dare to trust you out of my sight , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , wiping the dust off Nan 's little hot face ."
"`` Well , I wo n't , only papa tells me not to put off doing things , so I do n't . ''"
"`` That is rather a poser ; I think you had better give her some supper now , and a private lecture by and by , '' said Mr. Bhaer , too much amused to be angry at the young lady 's exploit ."
"The boys thought it `` great fun , '' and Nan entertained them all supper-time with an account of her adventures ; for a big dog had barked at her , a man had laughed at her , a woman had given her a doughnut , and her hat had fallen into the brook when she stopped to drink , exhausted with her exertion ."
"`` I fancy you will have your hands full now , my dear ; Tommy and Nan are quite enough for one woman , '' said Mr. Bhaer , half an hour later ."
"`` I know it will take some time to tame the child , but she is such a generous , warm-hearted little thing , I should love her even if she were twice as naughty , '' answered Mrs. Jo , pointing to the merry group , in the middle of which stood Nan , giving away her things right and left , as lavishly as if the big band-box had no bottom ."
"It was those good traits that soon made little `` Giddygaddy , '' as they called her , a favorite with every one ."
"Daisy never complained of being dull again , for Nan invented the most delightful plays , and her pranks rivalled Tommy 's , to the amusement of the whole school ."
"`` We all want to wear the nice things , so let us draw lots ."
Would n't that be the fairest way ? ''
"asked Merry , looking like a rosy little bride , under a great piece of illusion , which had done duty in many plays ."
"`` The Prince is light , so the Princess must be darkish ."
"We ought to choose the girl who will look best , as it is a picture ."
"I heard Miss Delano say so , when the ladies got up the tableaux , last winter , and every one wanted to be Cleopatra , '' said Jill decidedly ."
"`` You choose , and then if we ca n't agree we will draw lots , '' proposed Susy , who , being plain , knew there was little hope of her getting a chance in any other way ."
"So all stood in a row , and Jill , from her sofa , surveyed them critically , feeling that the one Jack would really prefer was not among the number ."
"`` I choose that one , for Juliet wants to be Queen , Molly would make faces , and the others are too big or too light , '' pronounced Jill , pointing to Merry , who looked pleased , while Mabel 's face darkened , and Susy gave a disdainful sniff ."
"`` You 'd better draw lots , and then there will be no fuss ."
"Ju and I are out of the fight , but you three can try , and let this settle the matter , '' said Molly , handing Jill a long strip of paper ."
"All agreed to let it be so , and when the bits were ready drew in turn ."
"This time fate was evidently on Merry 's side , and no one grumbled when she showed the longest paper ."
"`` Go and dress , then come back , and we 'll plan how we are to be placed before we call up the boys , '' commanded Jill , who was manager , since she could be nothing else ."
"The girls retired to the bedroom and began to `` rig up , '' as they called it ; but discontent still lurked among them , and showed itself in sharp words , envious looks , and disobliging acts ."
`` Am I to have the white silk and the feather ? ''
"asked Merry , delighted with the silvery shimmer of the one and the graceful droop of the other , though both were rather shabby ."
`` You can use your own dress .
"I do n't see why you should have everything , '' answered Susy , who was at the mirror , putting a wreath of scarlet flowers on her red head , bound to be gay since she could not be pretty ."
"`` I think I 'd better keep the plume , as I have n't anything else that is nice , and I 'm afraid Emma would n't like me to lend it , '' added Annette , who was disappointed that Mabel was not to be the Beauty . ''"
I do n't intend to act at all ! ''
"declared Mabel , beginning to braid up her hair with a jerk , out of humor with the whole affair . ''"
"I think you are a set of cross , selfish girls to back out and keep your nice things just because you ca n't all have the best part ."
I 'm ashamed of you ! ''
"scolded Molly , standing by Merry , who was sadly surveying her mother 's old purple silk , which looked like brown in the evening ."
"`` I 'm going to have Miss Delano 's red brocade for the Queen , and I shall ask her for the yellow-satin dress for Merry when I go to get mine , and tell her how mean you are , '' said Juliet , frowning under her gilt-paper crown as she swept about in a red table-cloth for train till the brocade arrived ."
"`` Perhaps you 'd like to have Mabel cut her hair off , so Merry can have that , too ? ''"
"cried Susy , with whom hair was a tender point ."
"`` Light hair is n't wanted , so Ju will have to give hers , or you 'd better borrow Miss Bat 's frisette , '' added Mabel , with a scornful laugh ."
`` I just wish Miss Bat was here to give you girls a good shaking .
"Do let someone else have a chance at the glass , you peacock ! ''"
"exclaimed Molly Loo , pushing Susy aside to arrange her own blue turban , out of which she plucked the pink pompon to give Merry ."
You ca n't conceive the effect of it .
"Brownie held out her arms to the Duke and he flung himself into them , the Queen leapt into the arms of the Lord Chamberlain , and the ladies of the court leapt into the arms of her gentlemen , for it is etiquette to follow her example in everything ."
"Thus in a single moment about fifty marriages took place , for if you leap into each other 's arms it is a fairy wedding ."
Of course a clergyman has to be present .
How the crowd cheered and leapt !
"Trumpets brayed , the moon came out , and immediately a thousand couples seized hold of its rays as if they were ribbons in a May dance and waltzed in wild abandon round the fairy ring ."
"Most gladsome sight of all , the Cupids plucked the hated fools ' caps from their heads and cast them high in the air ."
And then Maimie went and spoiled everything .
She could n't help it .
"She was crazy with delight over her little friend 's good fortune , so she took several steps forward and cried in an ecstasy , `` Oh , Brownie , how splendid ! ''"
"Everybody stood still , the music ceased , the lights went out , and all in the time you may take to say `` Oh dear ! ''"
"An awful sense of her peril came upon Maimie , too late she remembered that she was a lost child in a place where no human must be between the locking and the opening of the gates , she heard the murmur of an angry multitude , she saw a thousand swords flashing for her blood , and she uttered a cry of terror and fled ."
How she ran !
and all the time her eyes were starting out of her head .
"Many times she lay down , and then quickly jumped up and ran on again ."
Her little mind was so entangled in terrors that she no longer knew she was in the Gardens .
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as `` Slay her ! ''
`` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! ''
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"`` Anything except that , '' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies chanted `` Anything except that . ''"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her , that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
`` Now you 've done it !
I 'll give you a good thrashing when I get back ! ''
"roared Gus , shaking his fist at Joe , who stood staring , half-pleased , half-scared , at what he had done ."
`` Are you really going to try it ? ''
"asked Gus , as they glided on with increasing speed , and he , too , felt the charm of such a novel adventure , though the consequences bid fair to be serious ."
"`` Yes , I am , '' answered Frank , with the grim look he always wore when his strong will got the upper hand ."
"`` Bill will give it to us , any way , so we may as well have our fun out ."
"If you are afraid , I 'll slow down and you can jump off , '' and his brown eyes sparkled with the double delight of getting his heart 's desire and astonishing his friend at the same time by his skill and coolness ."
`` Go ahead .
"I 'll jump when you do ; '' and Gus calmly sat down again , bound in honor to stand by his mate till the smash came , though rather dismayed at the audacity of the prank ."
`` Do n't you call this just splendid ? ''
"exclaimed Frank , as they rolled along over the crossing , past the bridge , toward the curve , a mile from the station ."
`` Not bad .
They are yelling like mad after us .
"Better go back , if you can , '' said Gus , who was anxiously peering out , and , in spite of his efforts to seem at ease , not enjoying the trip a particle ."
`` Let them yell .
"I started to go to the curve , and I 'll do it if it costs me a hundred dollars ."
"No danger ; there 's no train under twenty minutes , I tell you , '' and Frank pulled out his watch ."
"But the sun was in his eyes , and he did not see clearly , or he would have discovered that it was later than he thought ."
"On they went , and were just rounding the bend when a shrill whistle in front startled both boys , and drove the color out of their cheeks ."
`` It 's the factory train ! ''
"cried Gus , in a husky tone , as he sprang to his feet ."
"`` No ; it 's the five-forty on the other road , '' answered Frank , with a queer thrill all through him at the thought of what might happen if it was not ."
"Both looked straight ahead as the last tree glided by , and the long track lay before them , with the freight train slowly coming down ."
"For an instant , the boys stood as if paralyzed ."
`` Jump ! ''
"said Gus , looking at the steep bank on one side and the river on the other , undecided which to try ."
`` Sit still ! ''
"commanded Frank , collecting his wits , as he gave a warning whistle to retard the on-coming train , while he reversed the engine and went back faster than he came ."
"A crowd of angry men was waiting for them , and Bill stood at the open switch in a towering passion as No. 11 returned to her place unharmed , but bearing two pale and frightened boys , who stepped slowly and silently down , without a word to say for themselves , while the freight train rumbled by on the main track ."
"Frank and Gus never had a very clear idea as to what occurred during the next few minutes , but vaguely remembered being well shaken , sworn at , questioned , threatened with direful penalties , and finally ordered off the premises forever by the wrathful depot-master ."
"Joe was nowhere to be seen , and as the two culprits walked away , trying to go steadily , while their heads spun round , and all the strength seemed to have departed from their legs , Frank said , in an exhausted tone , -- `` Come down to the boat-house and rest a minute . ''"
"Dan felt they did not quite trust him , and never showed them his best side , but took a wilful pleasure in trying their patience and thwarting their hopes as far as he dared ."
"Mr. Bhaer did not approve of fighting , and did not think it a proof of either manliness or courage for two lads to pommel one another for the amusement of the rest ."
"All sorts of hardy games and exercises were encouraged , and the boys were expected to take hard knocks and tumbles without whining ; but black eyes and bloody noses given for the fun of it were forbidden as a foolish and a brutal play ."
"Dan laughed at this rule , and told such exciting tales of his own valor , and the many frays that he had been in , that some of the lads were fired with a desire to have a regular good `` mill . ''"
"`` Do n't tell , and I 'll show you how , '' said Dan ; and , getting half a dozen of the lads together behind the barn , he gave them a lesson in boxing , which quite satisfied the ardor of most of them ."
"Emil , however , could not submit to be beaten by a fellow younger than himself , for Emil was past fourteen and a plucky fellow , so he challenged Dan to a fight ."
"Dan accepted at once , and the others looked on with intense interest ."
"What little bird carried the news to head-quarters no one ever knew , but , in the very hottest of the fray , when Dan and Emil were fighting like a pair of young bulldogs , and the others with fierce , excited faces were cheering them on , Mr. Bhaer walked into the ring , plucked the combatants apart with a strong hand , and said , in the voice they seldom heard , `` I ca n't allow this , boys !"
Stop it at once ; and never let me see it again .
"I keep a school for boys , not for wild beasts ."
Look at each other and be ashamed of yourselves . ''
"`` You let me go , and I 'll knock him down again , '' shouted Dan , sparring away in spite of the grip on his collar ."
"`` Come on , come on , I ai n't thrashed yet ! ''"
"cried Emil , who had been down five times , but did not know when he was beaten ."
"`` They are playing be gladdy what-you-call - 'em s , like the Romans , Uncle Fritz , '' called out Demi , whose eyes were bigger than ever with the excitement of this new pastime ."
"`` They were a fine set of brutes ; but we have learned something since then , I hope , and I can not have you make my barn a Colosseum ."
Who proposed this ? ''
asked Mr. Bhaer .
"`` Dan , '' answered several voices ."
`` Do n't you know that it is forbidden ? ''
"`` Yes , '' growled Dan , sullenly ."
`` Then why break the rule ? ''
"`` They 'll all be molly-coddles , if they do n't know how to fight . ''"
`` Have you found Emil a molly-coddle ?
"He does n't look much like one , '' and Mr. Bhaer brought the two face to face ."
"Dan had a black eye , and his jacket was torn to rags , but Emil 's face was covered with blood from a cut lip and a bruised nose , while a bump on his forehead was already as purple as a plum ."
"In spite of his wounds however , he still glared upon his foe , and evidently panted to renew the fight ."
"`` He 'd make a first-rater if he was taught , '' said Dan , unable to withhold the praise from the boy who made it necessary for him to do his best ."
"`` He 'll be taught to fence and box by and by , and till then I think he will do very well without any lessons in mauling ."
"Go and wash your faces ; and remember , Dan , if you break any more of the rules again , you will be sent away ."
That was the bargain ; do your part and we will do ours . ''
"The lads went off , and after a few more words to the spectators , Mr. Bhaer followed to bind up the wounds of the young gladiators ."
"`` There are plenty of lessons you can learn lying there , and several little jobs of work you can do for me . ''"
`` Can I ? ''
and Dan looked both surprised and pleased .
`` You can learn to be patient and cheerful in spite of pain and no play .
"You can amuse Teddy for me , wind cotton , read to me when I sew , and do many things without hurting your foot , which will make the days pass quickly , and not be wasted ones . ''"
"Here Demi ran in with a great butterfly in one hand , and a very ugly little toad in the other ."
"`` See , Dan , I found them , and ran back to give them to you ; are n't they beautiful ones ? ''"
"panted Demi , all out of breath ."
"Dan laughed at the toad , and said he had no place to put him , but the butterfly was a beauty , and if Mrs. Jo would give him a big pin , he would stick it right up in the drawer ."
"`` I do n't like to see the poor thing struggle on a pin ; if it must be killed , let us put it out of pain at once with a drop of camphor , '' said Mrs. Jo , getting out the bottle ."
"`` I know how to do it Mr. Hyde always killed 'em that way but I did n't have any camphor , so I use a pin , '' and Dan gently poured a drop on the insect 's head , when the pale green wings fluttered an instant , and then grew still ."
"This dainty little execution was hardly over when Teddy shouted from the bedroom , `` Oh , the little trabs are out , and the big one 's eaten 'em all up . ''"
"Demi and his aunt ran to the rescue , and found Teddy dancing excitedly in a chair , while two little crabs were scuttling about the floor , having got through the wires of the cage ."
"A third was clinging to the top of the cage , evidently in terror of his life , for below appeared a sad yet funny sight ."
"The big crab had wedged himself into the little recess where Polly 's cup used to stand , and there he sat eating one of his relations in the coolest way ."
"All the claws of the poor victim were pulled off , and he was turned upside down , his upper shell held in one claw close under the mouth of the big crab like a dish , while he leisurely ate out of it with the other claw , pausing now and then to turn his queer bulging eyes from side to side , and to put out a slender tongue and lick them in a way that made the children scream with laughter ."
"Mrs. Jo carried the cage in for Dan to see the sight , while Demi caught and confined the wanderers under an inverted wash-bowl ."
"`` I 'll have to let these fellers go , for I ca n't keep 'em in the house , '' said Dan , with evident regret ."
"`` I 'll take care of them for you , if you will tell me how , and they can live in my turtle-tank just as well as not , '' said Demi , who found them more interesting even that his beloved slow turtles ."
"So Dan gave him directions about the wants and habits of the crabs , and Demi bore them away to introduce them to their new home and neighbors ."
`` What a good boy he is ! ''
"said Dan , carefully settling the first butterfly , and remembering that Demi had given up his walk to bring it to him ."
"`` He ought to be , for a great deal has been done to make him so . ''"
"`` He 's had folks to tell him things , and to help him ; I have n't , '' said Dan , with a sigh , thinking of his neglected childhood , a thing he seldom did , and feeling as if he had not had fair play somehow ."
"`` I know it , dear , and for that reason I do n't expect as much from you as from Demi , though he is younger ; you shall have all the help that we can give you now , and I hope to teach you how to help yourself in the best way ."
"Have you forgotten what Father Bhaer told you when you were here before , about wanting to be good , and asking God to help you ? ''"
"`` No , ma'am , '' very low ."
`` Do you try that way still ? ''
"`` No , ma'am , '' lower still ."
`` Will you do it every night to please me ? ''
"`` Yes , ma'am , '' very soberly ."
"`` I shall depend on it , and I think I shall know if you are faithful to your promise , for these things always show to people who believe in them , though not a word is said ."
"The land is still far distant , and without my help you would never get there ."
"Climb on my back , and I will take you where you will . '"
"Uraschimataro did not wait to be asked twice , and thankfully accepted his friend 's help ."
"But scarcely was he seated firmly on the shell , when the turtle proposed that they should not return to the shore at once , but go under the sea , and look at some of the wonders that lay hidden there ."
"Uraschimataro agreed willingly , and in another moment they were deep , deep down , with fathoms of blue water above their heads ."
"Oh , how quickly they darted through the still , warm sea !"
"The young man held tight , and marvelled where they were going and how long they were to travel , but for three days they rushed on , till at last the turtle stopped before a splendid palace , shining with gold and silver , crystal and precious stones , and decked here and there with branches of pale pink coral and glittering pearls ."
"But if Uraschimataro was astonished at the beauty of the outside , he was struck dumb at the sight of the hall within , which was lighted by the blaze of fish scales ."
` Where have you brought me ? '
he asked his guide in a low voice .
"` To the palace of Ringu , the house of the sea god , whose subjects we all are , ' answered the turtle . '"
"I am the first waiting maid of his daughter , the lovely princess Otohime , whom you will shortly see . '"
"Uraschimataro was still so puzzled with the adventures that had befallen him , that he waited in a dazed condition for what would happen next ."
"But the turtle , who had talked so much of him to the princess that she had expressed a wish to see him , went at once to make known his arrival ."
"And directly the princess beheld him her heart was set on him , and she begged him to stay with her , and in return promised that he should never grow old , neither should his beauty fade ."
` Is not that reward enough ? '
"she asked , smiling , looking all the while as fair as the sun itself ."
"And Uraschimataro said ` Yes , ' and so he stayed there ."
For how long ?
That he only knew later .
"His life passed by , and each hour seemed happier than the last , when one day there rushed over him a terrible longing to see his parents ."
"He fought against it hard , knowing how it would grieve the princess , but it grew on him stronger and stronger , till at length he became so sad that the princess inquired what was wrong ."
"Then he told her of the longing he had to visit his old home , and that he must see his parents once more ."
"The princess was almost frozen with horror , and implored him to stay with her , or something dreadful would be sure to happen ."
"` You will never come back , and we shall meet again no more , ' she moaned bitterly ."
"But Uraschimataro stood firm and repeated , ` Only this once will I leave you , and then will I return to your side for ever . '"
"Sadly the princess shook her head , but she answered slowly , ` One way there is to bring you safely back , but I fear you will never agree to the conditions of the bargain . ' '"
"I will do anything that will bring me back to you , ' exclaimed Uraschimataro , looking at her tenderly , but the princess was silent : she knew too well that when he left her she would see his face no more ."
"Then she took from a shelf a tiny golden box , and gave it to Uraschimataro , praying him to keep it carefully , and above all things never to open it ."
"` If you can do this , ' she said as she bade him farewell , ` your friend the turtle will meet you at the shore , and will carry you back to me . '"
"Uraschimataro thanked her from his heart , and swore solemnly to do her bidding ."
"He hid the box safely in his garments , seated himself on the back of the turtle , and vanished in the ocean path , waving his hand to the princess ."
The scene must have been highly farcical . ''
"I thought myself it was a silly business , but I could not forget my father had a hand in it ."
"`` Surely , sir , it had some note of tragedy , '' said I. `` Why , no , sir , not at all , '' returned the lawyer ."
"`` For tragedy implies some ponderable matter in dispute , some dignus vindice nodus ; and this piece of work was all about the petulance of a young ass that had been spoiled , and wanted nothing so much as to be tied up and soundly belted ."
"However , that was not your father 's view ; and the end of it was , that from concession to concession on your father 's part , and from one height to another of squalling , sentimental selfishness upon your uncle 's , they came at last to drive a sort of bargain , from whose ill results you have recently been smarting ."
"The one man took the lady , the other the estate ."
"Now , Mr. David , they talk a great deal of charity and generosity ; but in this disputable state of life , I often think the happiest consequences seem to flow when a gentleman consults his lawyer , and takes all the law allows him ."
"Anyhow , this piece of Quixotry on your father 's part , as it was unjust in itself , has brought forth a monstrous family of injustices ."
"Your father and mother lived and died poor folk ; you were poorly reared ; and in the meanwhile , what a time it has been for the tenants on the estate of Shaws !"
And I might add -LRB- if it was a matter I cared much about -RRB- what a time for Mr. Ebenezer ! ''
"`` And yet that is certainly the strangest part of all , '' said I , `` that a man 's nature should thus change . ''"
"`` True , '' said Mr. Rankeillor ."
`` And yet I imagine it was natural enough .
He could not think that he had played a handsome part .
"Those who knew the story gave him the cold shoulder ; those who knew it not , seeing one brother disappear , and the other succeed in the estate , raised a cry of murder ; so that upon all sides he found himself evited ."
"Money was all he got by his bargain ; well , he came to think the more of money ."
"He was selfish when he was young , he is selfish now that he is old ; and the latter end of all these pretty manners and fine feelings you have seen for yourself . ''"
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` and in all this , what is my position ? ''"
"`` The estate is yours beyond a doubt , '' replied the lawyer ."
"`` It matters nothing what your father signed , you are the heir of entail ."
But your uncle is a man to fight the indefensible ; and it would be likely your identity that he would call in question .
"A lawsuit is always expensive , and a family lawsuit always scandalous ; besides which , if any of your doings with your friend Mr. Thomson were to come out , we might find that we had burned our fingers ."
"The kidnapping , to be sure , would be a court card upon our side , if we could only prove it ."
"But it may be difficult to prove ; and my advice -LRB- upon the whole -RRB- is to make a very easy bargain with your uncle , perhaps even leaving him at Shaws where he has taken root for a quarter of a century , and contenting yourself in the meanwhile with a fair provision . ''"
"I told him I was very willing to be easy , and that to carry family concerns before the public was a step from which I was naturally much averse ."
In the meantime -LRB- thinking to myself -RRB- I began to see the outlines of that scheme on which we afterwards acted .
"`` The great affair , '' I asked , `` is to bring home to him the kidnapping ? ''"
"`` Surely , '' said Mr. Rankeillor , `` and if possible , out of court ."
"For mark you here , Mr. David : we could no doubt find some men of the Covenant who would swear to your reclusion ; but once they were in the box , we could no longer check their testimony , and some word of your friend Mr. Thomson must certainly crop out ."
Which -LRB- from what you have let fall -RRB- I can not think to be desirable . ''
"`` Well , sir , '' said I , `` here is my way of it . ''"
And I opened my plot to him .
When Sara was fifteen she had gone away to school .
Jeff had missed her sorely .
"For four years he saw her only in the summers , and each year she had seemed taller , statelier , further from him ."
"When she graduated her father took her abroad for two years ; then she came home , a lovely , high-bred girl , dimpling on the threshold of womanhood ; and Jeffrey Miller was face to face with two bitter facts ."
"One was that he loved her -- not with the boy-and-girl love of long ago , but with the love of a man for the one woman in the world ; and the other was that she was as far beyond his reach as one of those sunset stars of which she had always reminded him in her pure , clear-shining loveliness ."
"He looked these facts unflinchingly in the face until he had grown used to them , and then he laid down his course for himself ."
"He loved Sara -- and he did not wish to conquer his love , even if it had been possible ."
"It were better to love her , whom he could never win , than to love and be loved by any other woman ."
"His great office in life was to be her friend , humble and unexpectant ; to be at hand if she should need him for ever so trifling a service ; never to presume , always to be faithful ."
Sara had not forgotten her old friend .
"But their former comradeship was now impossible ; they could be friends , but never again companions ."
"Sara 's life was full and gay ; she had interests in which he had no share ; her social world was utterly apart from his ; she was of the hill and its traditions , he was of the valley and its people ."
"The democracy of childhood past , there was no common ground on which they might meet ."
Only one thing Jeffrey had found it impossible to contemplate calmly .
"Some day Sara would marry -- a man who was her equal , who sat at her father 's table as a guest ."
"In spite of himself , Jeffrey 's heart filled with hot rebellion at the thought ; it was like a desecration and a robbery ."
"But , as the years went by , this thing he dreaded did not happen ."
"Sara did not marry , although gossip assigned her many suitors not unworthy of her ."
"She and Jeffrey were always friends , although they met but seldom ."
Sometimes she sent him a book ; it was his custom to search for the earliest mayflowers and take them to her ; once in a long while they met and talked of many things .
"Jeffrey 's calendar from year to year was red-lettered by these small happenings , of which nobody knew , or , knowing , would have cared ."
"So he and Sara drifted out of youth , together yet apart ."
"Her mother had died , and Sara was the gracious , stately mistress of Pinehurst , which grew quieter as the time went on ; the lovers ceased to come , and holiday friends grew few ; with the old colonel 's failing health the gaieties and lavish entertaining ceased ."
"Jeffrey thought that Sara must often be lonely , but she never said so ; she remained sweet , serene , calm-eyed , like the child he had met on the hill ."
"Only , now and then , Jeffrey fancied he saw a shadow on her face -- a shadow so faint and fleeting that only the eye of an unselfish , abiding love , made clear-sighted by patient years , could have seen it ."
"It hurt him , that shadow ; he would have given anything in his power to have banished it ."
And now this long friendship was to be broken .
Sara was going away .
"At first he had thought only of her pain , but now his own filled his heart ."
How could he live without her ?
How could he dwell in the valley knowing that she had gone from the hill ?
Never to see her light shine down on him through the northern gap in the pines at night !
"She was the cannibal of the seas , and scarce needed that watchful eye , for she floated immune in the horror of her name ."
"She was wrapped in the blanket of night , through which no sound from her could have reached the shore ."
"There was little sound , and none agreeable save the whir of the ship 's sewing machine at which Smee sat , ever industrious and obliging , the essence of the commonplace , pathetic Smee ."
"I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic , unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it ; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him , and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook 's tears and made it flow ."
"Of this , as of almost everything else , Smee was quite unconscious ."
"A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks , drinking in the miasma -LSB- putrid mist -RSB- of the night ; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards ; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck , where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out of Hook 's reach , lest he should claw them mechanically in passing ."
Hook trod the deck in thought .
O man unfathomable .
It was his hour of triumph .
"Peter had been removed for ever from his path , and all the other boys were in the brig , about to walk the plank ."
"It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel ; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man , could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily , bellied out by the winds of his success ?"
"But there was no elation in his gait , which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind ."
Hook was profoundly dejected .
He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night .
It was because he was so terribly alone .
This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs .
They were socially inferior to him .
Hook was not his true name .
"To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze ; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed , he had been at a famous public school ; and its traditions still clung to him like garments , with which indeed they are largely concerned ."
"Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled -LSB- attacked -RSB- her , and he still adhered in his walk to the school 's distinguished slouch ."
But above all he retained the passion for good form .
Good form !
"However much he may have degenerated , he still knew that this is all that really matters ."
"From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals , and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap , like hammering in the night when one can not sleep ."
`` Have you been good form to-day ? ''
was their eternal question .
"`` Fame , fame , that glittering bauble , it is mine , '' he cried ."
`` Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything ? ''
the tap-tap from his school replied .
"`` I am the only man whom Barbecue feared , '' he urged , `` and Flint feared Barbecue . ''"
"`` Barbecue , Flint -- what house ? ''"
came the cutting retort .
"It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins , but we were alarmed for his safety ."
"With the men in the temper they were in , it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again ."
We ran on deck .
"The pitch was bubbling in the seams ; the nasty stench of the place turned me sick ; if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery , it was in that abominable anchorage ."
"The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ; ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each , hard by where the river runs in ."
One of them was whistling `` Lillibullero . ''
"Waiting was a strain , and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information ."
"The gigs had leaned to their right , but Hunter and I pulled straight in , in the direction of the stockade upon the chart ."
"The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance ; `` Lillibullero '' stopped off , and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do ."
"Had they gone and told Silver , all might have turned out differently ; but they had their orders , I suppose , and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to `` Lillibullero . ''"
"There was a slight bend in the coast , and I steered so as to put it between us ; even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs ."
"I jumped out and came as near running as I durst , with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness ' sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety ."
I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade .
This was how it was : a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll .
"Well , on the knoll , and enclosing the spring , they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side ."
"All round this they had cleared a wide space , and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high , without door or opening , too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers ."
The people in the log-house had them in every way ; they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges .
"All they wanted was a good watch and food ; for , short of a complete surprise , they might have held the place against a regiment ."
What particularly took my fancy was the spring .
"For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA , with plenty of arms and ammunition , and things to eat , and excellent wines , there had been one thing overlooked -- we had no water ."
I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death .
"I was not new to violent death -- I have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland , and got a wound myself at Fontenoy -- but I know my pulse went dot and carry one ."
"`` Jim Hawkins is gone , '' was my first thought ."
"It is something to have been an old soldier , but more still to have been a doctor ."
There is no time to dilly-dally in our work .
"And so now I made up my mind instantly , and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat ."
By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar .
"We made the water fly , and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner ."
"I found them all shaken , as was natural ."
"The squire was sitting down , as white as a sheet , thinking of the harm he had led us to , the good soul !"
And one of the six forecastle hands was little better .
"`` There 's a man , '' says Captain Smollett , nodding towards him , `` new to this work ."
"` Well , but I do n't see how I am to get to you , ' said the Stalo , looking up and down ."
"` Jump over , as I did , ' answered Andras ; ` it is quite easy . '"
"` But I could not jump this river ; and I do n't know how you did , ' replied the Stalo . '"
"I should be ashamed to say such things , ' exclaimed Andras ."
"` Do you mean to tell me that a jump , which the weakest Lapp boy would make nothing of , is beyond your strength ? '"
"The Stalo grew red and angry when he heard these words , just as Andras meant him to do ."
He bounded into the air and fell straight into the river .
"Not that that would have mattered , for he was a good swimmer ; but Andras drew out the bow and arrows which every Lapp carries , and took aim at him ."
"His aim was good , but the Stalo sprang so high into the air that the arrow flew between his feet ."
"A second shot , directed at his forehead , fared no better , for this time the Stalo jumped so high to the other side that the arrow passed between his finger and thumb ."
"Then Andras aimed his third arrow a little over the Stalo 's head , and when he sprang up , just an instant too soon , it hit him between the ribs ."
"Mortally wounded as he was , the Stalo was not yet dead , and managed to swim to the shore ."
"Stretching himself on the sand , he said slowly to Andras : ` Promise that you will give me an honourable burial , and when my body is laid in the grave go in my boat across the fiord , and take whatever you find in my house which belongs to me ."
"My dog you must kill , but spare my son , Andras . '"
Then he died ; and Andras sailed in his boat away across the fiord and found the dog and boy .
"The dog , a fierce , wicked-looking creature , he slew with one blow from his fist , for it is well known that if a Stalo 's dog licks the blood that flows from his dead master 's wounds the Stalo comes to life again ."
"That is why no REAL Stalo is ever seen without his dog ; but the bailiff , being only half a Stalo , had forgotten him , when he went to the little lakes in search of Andras ."
"Next , Andras put all the gold and jewels which he found in the boat into his pockets , and bidding the boy get in , pushed it off from the shore , leaving the little craft to drift as it would , while he himself ran home ."
"With the treasure he possessed he was able to buy a great herd of reindeer ; and he soon married a rich wife , whose parents would not have him as a son-in-law when he was poor , and the two lived happy for ever after ."
"The White Slipper -LSB- From Lapplandische Mahrchen , J. C. Poestion . -RSB-"
Once upon a time there lived a king who had a daughter just fifteen years old .
And what a daughter !
"Even the mothers who had daughters of their own could not help allowing that the princess was much more beautiful and graceful than any of them ; and , as for the fathers , if one of them ever beheld her by accident he could talk of nothing else for a whole day afterwards ."
"Of course the king , whose name was Balancin , was the complete slave of his little girl from the moment he lifted her from the arms of her dead mother ; indeed , he did not seem to know that there was anyone else in the world to love ."
"Now Diamantina , for that was her name , did not reach her fifteenth birthday without proposals for marriage from every country under heaven ; but be the suitor who he might , the king always said him nay ."
"Behind the palace a large garden stretched away to the foot of some hills , and more than one river flowed through ."
"Hither the princess would come each evening towards sunset , attended by her ladies , and gather herself the flowers that were to adorn her rooms ."
"She also brought with her a pair of scissors to cut off the dead blooms , and a basket to put them in , so that when the sun rose next morning he might see nothing unsightly ."
"When she had finished this task she would take a walk through the town , so that the poor people might have a chance of speaking with her , and telling her of their troubles ; and then she would seek out her father , and together they would consult over the best means of giving help to those who needed it ."
But what has all this to do with the White Slipper ?
my readers will ask .
"Have patience , and you will see ."
"I was so thinking when , upon a sudden , Mr. Rankeillor cried out , clapped his hand to his pockets , and began to laugh ."
"`` Why , '' he cries , `` if this be not a farcical adventure !"
"After all that I said , I have forgot my glasses ! ''"
"At that , of course , I understood the purpose of his anecdote , and knew that if he had left his spectacles at home , it had been done on purpose , so that he might have the benefit of Alan 's help without the awkwardness of recognising him ."
"And indeed it was well thought upon ; for now -LRB- suppose things to go the very worst -RRB- how could Rankeillor swear to my friend 's identity , or how be made to bear damaging evidence against myself ?"
"For all that , he had been a long while of finding out his want , and had spoken to and recognised a good few persons as we came through the town ; and I had little doubt myself that he saw reasonably well ."
"As soon as we were past the Hawes -LRB- where I recognised the landlord smoking his pipe in the door , and was amazed to see him look no older -RRB- Mr. Rankeillor changed the order of march , walking behind with Torrance and sending me forward in the manner of a scout ."
"I went up the hill , whistling from time to time my Gaelic air ; and at length I had the pleasure to hear it answered and to see Alan rise from behind a bush ."
"He was somewhat dashed in spirits , having passed a long day alone skulking in the county , and made but a poor meal in an alehouse near Dundas ."
"But at the mere sight of my clothes , he began to brighten up ; and as soon as I had told him in what a forward state our matters were and the part I looked to him to play in what remained , he sprang into a new man ."
"`` And that is a very good notion of yours , '' says he ; `` and I dare to say that you could lay your hands upon no better man to put it through than Alan Breck ."
"It is not a thing -LRB- mark ye -RRB- that any one could do , but takes a gentleman of penetration ."
"But it sticks in my head your lawyer-man will be somewhat wearying to see me , '' says Alan ."
"Accordingly I cried and waved on Mr. Rankeillor , who came up alone and was presented to my friend , Mr. Thomson ."
"`` Mr. Thomson , I am pleased to meet you , '' said he ."
"`` But I have forgotten my glasses ; and our friend , Mr. David here '' -LRB- clapping me on the shoulder -RRB- , `` will tell you that I am little better than blind , and that you must not be surprised if I pass you by to-morrow . ''"
"This he said , thinking that Alan would be pleased ; but the Highlandman 's vanity was ready to startle at a less matter than that ."
"`` Why , sir , '' says he , stiffly , `` I would say it mattered the less as we are met here for a particular end , to see justice done to Mr. Balfour ; and by what I can see , not very likely to have much else in common ."
"But I accept your apology , which was a very proper one to make . ''"
"`` And that is more than I could look for , Mr. Thomson , '' said Rankeillor , heartily ."
"`` And now as you and I are the chief actors in this enterprise , I think we should come into a nice agreement ; to which end , I propose that you should lend me your arm , for -LRB- what with the dusk and the want of my glasses -RRB- I am not very clear as to the path ; and as for you , Mr. David , you will find Torrance a pleasant kind of body to speak with ."
"Only let me remind you , it 's quite needless he should hear more of your adventures or those of -- ahem -- Mr. Thomson . ''"
"Accordingly these two went on ahead in very close talk , and Torrance and I brought up the rear ."
Night was quite come when we came in view of the house of Shaws .
"Ten had been gone some time ; it was dark and mild , with a pleasant , rustling wind in the south-west that covered the sound of our approach ; and as we drew near we saw no glimmer of light in any portion of the building ."
"It seemed my uncle was already in bed , which was indeed the best thing for our arrangements ."
"We made our last whispered consultations some fifty yards away ; and then the lawyer and Torrance and I crept quietly up and crouched down beside the corner of the house ; and as soon as we were in our places , Alan strode to the door without concealment and began to knock ."
"CHAPTER XXIX I COME INTO MY KINGDOM For some time Alan volleyed upon the door , and his knocking only roused the echoes of the house and neighbourhood ."
"At last , however , I could hear the noise of a window gently thrust up , and knew that my uncle had come to his observatory ."
"By what light there was , he would see Alan standing , like a dark shadow , on the steps ; the three witnesses were hidden quite out of his view ; so that there was nothing to alarm an honest man in his own house ."
"For all that , he studied his visitor awhile in silence , and when he spoke his voice had a quaver of misgiving ."
`` What 's this ? ''
"He gave me one look as much as to say , `` Well done , David ! ''"
and off he set again at his top speed .
It grew cooler and even a little darker -LRB- but not much -RRB- with the coming of the night .
"The sky was cloudless ; it was still early in July , and pretty far north ; in the darkest part of that night , you would have needed pretty good eyes to read , but for all that , I have often seen it darker in a winter mid-day ."
Heavy dew fell and drenched the moor like rain ; and this refreshed me for a while .
"When we stopped to breathe , and I had time to see all about me , the clearness and sweetness of the night , the shapes of the hills like things asleep , and the fire dwindling away behind us , like a bright spot in the midst of the moor , anger would come upon me in a clap that I must still drag myself in agony and eat the dust like a worm ."
"By what I have read in books , I think few that have held a pen were ever really wearied , or they would write of it more strongly ."
"I had no care of my life , neither past nor future , and I scarce remembered there was such a lad as David Balfour ."
"I did not think of myself , but just of each fresh step which I was sure would be my last , with despair -- and of Alan , who was the cause of it , with hatred ."
"Alan was in the right trade as a soldier ; this is the officer 's part to make men continue to do things , they know not wherefore , and when , if the choice was offered , they would lie down where they were and be killed ."
"And I dare say I would have made a good enough private ; for in these last hours it never occurred to me that I had any choice but just to obey as long as I was able , and die obeying ."
"Day began to come in , after years , I thought ; and by that time we were past the greatest danger , and could walk upon our feet like men , instead of crawling like brutes ."
"But , dear heart have mercy !"
"what a pair we must have made , going double like old grandfathers , stumbling like babes , and as white as dead folk ."
"Never a word passed between us ; each set his mouth and kept his eyes in front of him , and lifted up his foot and set it down again , like people lifting weights at a country play ; * all the while , with the moorfowl crying `` peep ! ''"
"in the heather , and the light coming slowly clearer in the east ."
* Village fair .
I say Alan did as I did .
"Not that ever I looked at him , for I had enough ado to keep my feet ; but because it is plain he must have been as stupid with weariness as myself , and looked as little where we were going , or we should not have walked into an ambush like blind men ."
It fell in this way .
"We were going down a heathery brae , Alan leading and I following a pace or two behind , like a fiddler and his wife ; when upon a sudden the heather gave a rustle , three or four ragged men leaped out , and the next moment we were lying on our backs , each with a dirk at his throat ."
I do n't think I cared ; the pain of this rough handling was quite swallowed up by the pains of which I was already full ; and I was too glad to have stopped walking to mind about a dirk .
"I lay looking up in the face of the man that held me ; and I mind his face was black with the sun , and his eyes very light , but I was not afraid of him ."
I heard Alan and another whispering in the Gaelic ; and what they said was all one to me .
"Then the dirks were put up , our weapons were taken away , and we were set face to face , sitting in the heather ."
"`` They are Cluny 's men , '' said Alan ."
`` We couldnae have fallen better .
"We 're just to bide here with these , which are his out-sentries , till they can get word to the chief of my arrival . ''"
"Now Cluny Macpherson , the chief of the clan Vourich , had been one of the leaders of the great rebellion six years before ; there was a price on his life ; and I had supposed him long ago in France , with the rest of the heads of that desperate party ."
"Even tired as I was , the surprise of what I heard half wakened me ."
"`` What , '' I cried , `` is Cluny still here ? ''"
"`` Ay , is he so ! ''"
"We had a dreary morning 's work before us , for there was no sign of any wind , and the boats had to be got out and manned , and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island ."
"I volunteered for one of the boats , where I had , of course , no business ."
"The heat was sweltering , and the men grumbled fiercely over their work ."
"Anderson was in command of my boat , and instead of keeping the crew in order , he grumbled as loud as the worst ."
"`` Well , '' he said with an oath , `` it 's not forever . ''"
"I thought this was a very bad sign , for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business ; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline ."
"All the way in , Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship ."
"He knew the passage like the palm of his hand , and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart , John never hesitated once ."
"`` There 's a strong scour with the ebb , '' he said , `` and this here passage has been dug out , in a manner of speaking , with a spade . ''"
"We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart , about a third of a mile from each shore , the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other ."
The bottom was clean sand .
"The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods , but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent ."
"The place was entirely land-locked , buried in woods , the trees coming right down to high-water mark , the shores mostly flat , and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre , one here , one there ."
"Two little rivers , or rather two swamps , emptied out into this pond , as you might call it ; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness ."
"From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade , for they were quite buried among trees ; and if it had not been for the chart on the companion , we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas ."
"There was not a breath of air moving , nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside ."
A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchorage -- a smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks .
"I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing , like someone tasting a bad egg ."
"`` I do n't know about treasure , '' he said , `` but I 'll stake my wig there 's fever here . ''"
"If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat , it became truly threatening when they had come aboard ."
They lay about the deck growling together in talk .
The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed .
"Even the honest hands must have caught the infection , for there was not one man aboard to mend another ."
"Mutiny , it was plain , hung over us like a thunder-cloud ."
And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger .
"Long John was hard at work going from group to group , spending himself in good advice , and as for example no man could have shown a better ."
He fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility ; he was all smiles to everyone .
"If an order were given , John would be on his crutch in an instant , with the cheeriest `` Aye , aye , sir ! ''"
"in the world ; and when there was nothing else to do , he kept up one song after another , as if to conceal the discontent of the rest ."
"Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon , this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst ."
We held a council in the cabin .
"`` Sir , '' said the captain , `` if I risk another order , the whole ship 'll come about our ears by the run ."
"And now , '' said she when I had done so , `` we have to get the key off THAT ; and who 's to touch it , I should like to know ! ''"
and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words .
I went down on my knees at once .
"On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper , blackened on the one side ."
"I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT ; and taking it up , I found written on the other side , in a very good , clear hand , this short message : `` You have till ten tonight . ''"
"`` He had till ten , Mother , '' said I ; and just as I said it , our old clock began striking ."
"This sudden noise startled us shockingly ; but the news was good , for it was only six ."
"`` Now , Jim , '' she said , `` that key . ''"
"I felt in his pockets , one after another ."
"A few small coins , a thimble , and some thread and big needles , a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end , his gully with the crooked handle , a pocket compass , and a tinder box were all that they contained , and I began to despair ."
"`` Perhaps it 's round his neck , '' suggested my mother ."
"Overcoming a strong repugnance , I tore open his shirt at the neck , and there , sure enough , hanging to a bit of tarry string , which I cut with his own gully , we found the key ."
At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival .
"It was like any other seaman 's chest on the outside , the initial `` B '' burned on the top of it with a hot iron , and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long , rough usage ."
"`` Give me the key , '' said my mother ; and though the lock was very stiff , she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling ."
"A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior , but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes , carefully brushed and folded ."
"They had never been worn , my mother said ."
"Under that , the miscellany began -- a quadrant , a tin canikin , several sticks of tobacco , two brace of very handsome pistols , a piece of bar silver , an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make , a pair of compasses mounted with brass , and five or six curious West Indian shells ."
"I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering , guilty , and hunted life ."
"In the meantime , we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets , and neither of these were in our way ."
"Underneath there was an old boat-cloak , whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar ."
"My mother pulled it up with impatience , and there lay before us , the last things in the chest , a bundle tied up in oilcloth , and looking like papers , and a canvas bag that gave forth , at a touch , the jingle of gold ."
"`` I 'll show these rogues that I 'm an honest woman , '' said my mother ."
"`` I 'll have my dues , and not a farthing over ."
Hold Mrs. Crossley 's bag . ''
And she began to count over the amount of the captain 's score from the sailor 's bag into the one that I was holding .
"It was a long , difficult business , for the coins were of all countries and sizes -- doubloons , and louis d'ors , and guineas , and pieces of eight , and I know not what besides , all shaken together at random ."
"The guineas , too , were about the scarcest , and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count ."
"When we were about half-way through , I suddenly put my hand upon her arm , for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth -- the tap-tapping of the blind man 's stick upon the frozen road ."
"It drew nearer and nearer , while we sat holding our breath ."
"Then it struck sharp on the inn door , and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter ; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without ."
"At last the tapping recommenced , and , to our indescribable joy and gratitude , died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard ."
"`` Mother , '' said I , `` take the whole and let 's be going , '' for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet 's nest about our ears , though how thankful I was that I had bolted it , none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man ."
"But my mother , frightened as she was , would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less ."
"It was not yet seven , she said , by a long way ; she knew her rights and she would have them ; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill ."
"That was enough , and more than enough , for both of us ."
"`` I 'll take what I have , '' she said , jumping to her feet ."
"`` And I 'll take this to square the count , '' said I , picking up the oilskin packet ."
"Next moment we were both groping downstairs , leaving the candle by the empty chest ; and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat ."
We had not started a moment too soon .
The fog was rapidly dispersing ; already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side ; and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape .
"Far less than half-way to the hamlet , very little beyond the bottom of the hill , we must come forth into the moonlight ."
"Nor was this all , for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears , and as we looked back in their direction , a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern ."
"`` My dear , '' said my mother suddenly , `` take the money and run on ."
I am going to faint . ''
"This was certainly the end for both of us , I thought ."
"How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours ; how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed , for her past foolhardiness and present weakness !"
"We were just at the little bridge , by good fortune ; and I helped her , tottering as she was , to the edge of the bank , where , sure enough , she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder ."
"I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all , and I am afraid it was roughly done , but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch ."
"Farther I could not move her , for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it ."
So there we had to stay -- my mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn .
"5 The Last of the Blind Man MY curiosity , in a sense , was stronger than my fear , for I could not remain where I was , but crept back to the bank again , whence , sheltering my head behind a bush of broom , I might command the road before our door ."
"I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive , seven or eight of them , running hard , their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front ."
"Three men ran together , hand in hand ; and I made out , even through the mist , that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar ."
The next moment his voice showed me that I was right .
`` Down with the door ! ''
he cried .
"`` Aye , aye , sir ! ''"
"answered two or three ; and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow , the lantern-bearer following ; and then I could see them pause , and hear speeches passed in a lower key , as if they were surprised to find the door open ."
"But the pause was brief , for the blind man again issued his commands ."
"His voice sounded louder and higher , as if he were afire with eagerness and rage ."
"`` In , in , in ! ''"
"he shouted , and cursed them for their delay ."
"Four or five of them obeyed at once , two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar ."
She was not in the least cold .
"She was wearing a russet-coloured pelisse and had the hood over her head , so that nothing of her showed except her dear little face and her curls ."
The rest of her real self was hidden far away inside so many warm garments that in shape she seemed rather like a ball .
She was about forty round the waist .
"There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk , where Maimie arrived in time to see a magnolia and a Persian lilac step over the railing and set off for a smart walk ."
"They moved in a jerky sort of way certainly , but that was because they used crutches ."
"An elderberry hobbled across the walk , and stood chatting with some young quinces , and they all had crutches ."
The crutches were the sticks that are tied to young trees and shrubs .
"They were quite familiar objects to Maimie , but she had never known what they were for until to-night ."
-LSB- Illustration : There was a good deal going on in the Baby Walk -RSB- She peeped up the walk and saw her first fairy .
He was a street boy fairy who was running up the walk closing the weeping trees .
"The way he did it was this : he pressed a spring in the trunks and they shut like umbrellas , deluging the little plants beneath with snow . '"
"O you naughty , naughty child ! '"
"Maimie cried indignantly , for she knew what it was to have a dripping umbrella about your ears ."
"Fortunately the mischievous fellow was out of earshot , but a chrysanthemum heard her , and said so pointedly , ` Hoity-toity , what is this ? '"
that she had to come out and show herself .
Then the whole vegetable kingdom was rather puzzled what to do .
"-LSB- Illustration : An afternoon when the Gardens were white with snow -RSB- ` Of course it is no affair of ours , ' a spindle-tree said after they had whispered together , ` but you know quite well you ought not to be here , and perhaps our duty is to report you to the fairies ; what do you think yourself ? ' '"
"I think you should not , ' Maimie replied , which so perplexed them that they said petulantly there was no arguing with her . '"
"I would n't ask it of you , ' she assured them , ` if I thought it was wrong , ' and of course after this they could not well carry tales ."
"They then said , ` Well-a-day , ' and ` Such is life , ' for they can be frightfully sarcastic ; but she felt sorry for those of them who had no crutches , and she said good-naturedly , ` Before I go to the fairies ' ball , I should like to take you for a walk one at a time ; you can lean on me , you know . '"
"At this they clapped their hands , and she escorted them up the Baby Walk and back again , one at a time , putting an arm or a finger round the very frail , setting their leg right when it got too ridiculous , and treating the foreign ones quite as courteously as the English , though she could not understand a word they said ."
"They behaved well on the whole , though some whimpered that she had not taken them as far as she took Nancy or Grace or Dorothy , and others jagged her , but it was quite unintentional , and she was too much of a lady to cry out ."
"So much walking tired her , and she was anxious to be off to the ball , but she no longer felt afraid ."
"The reason she felt no more fear was that it was now night-time , and in the dark , you remember , Maimie was always rather strange ."
"They were now loth to let her go , for , ` If the fairies see you , ' they warned her , ` they will mischief you -- stab you to death , or compel you to nurse their children , or turn you into something tedious , like an evergreen oak . '"
"As they said this they looked with affected pity at an evergreen oak , for in winter they are very envious of the evergreens ."
"` Oh , la ! '"
"replied the oak bitingly , ` how deliciously cosy it is to stand here buttoned to the neck and watch you poor naked creatures shivering . '"
"This made them sulky , though they had really brought it on themselves , and they drew for Maimie a very gloomy picture of the perils that would face her if she insisted on going to the ball ."
"-LSB- Illustration : She ran to St. Govor 's Well and hid -RSB- She learned from a purple filbert that the court was not in its usual good temper at present , the cause being the tantalising heart of the Duke of Christmas Daisies ."
"He was an Oriental fairy , very poorly of a dreadful complaint , namely , inability to love , and though he had tried many ladies in many lands he could not fall in love with one of them ."
"` That does n't matter , ' said Peter , as if he were the only person present who knew all about it , though he was really the one who knew least ."
` What we need is just a nice motherly person . '
` Oh dear ! '
"Wendy said , ` you see I feel that is exactly what I am . '"
"` It is , it is , ' they all cried ; ` we saw it at once . '"
"` Very well , ' she said , ' I will do my best ."
"Come inside at once , you naughty children ; I am sure your feet are damp ."
And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella . '
"In they went ; I do n't know how there was room for them , but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland ."
And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy .
"By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees , but she herself slept that night in the little house , and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword , for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl ."
"The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness , with a bright light showing through its blinds , and the chimney smoking beautifully , and Peter standing on guard ."
"After a time he fell asleep , and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy ."
"Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed , but they just tweaked Peter 's nose and passed on ."
-LSB- Illustration : PETER ON GUARD -RSB- CHAPTER VII THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees .
"Hook , you remember , had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece , but this was ignorance , for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down , and no two of the boys were quite the same size ."
"Once you fitted , you drew in your breath at the top , and down you went at exactly the right speed , while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately , and so wriggled up ."
"Of course , when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them , and then nothing can be more graceful ."
"But you simply must fit , and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes : the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you , while you have to be made to fit the tree ."
"Usually it is done quite easily , as by your wearing too many garments or too few ; but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape , Peter does some things to you , and after that you fit ."
"Once you fit , great care must be taken to go on fitting , and this , as Wendy was to discover to her delight , keeps a whole family in perfect condition ."
"Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try , but John had to be altered a little ."
After a few days ' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well .
And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground ; especially Wendy .
"It consisted of one large room , as all houses should do , with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing , and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour , which were used as stools ."
"A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room , but every morning they sawed the trunk through , level with the floor ."
"By tea-time it was always about two feet high , and then they put a door on top of it , the whole thus becoming a table ; as soon as they cleared away , they sawed off the trunk again , and thus there was more room to play ."
"There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it , and across this Wendy stretched strings , made of fibre , from which she suspended her washing ."
"The bed was tilted against the wall by day , and let down at 6.30 , when it filled nearly half the room ; and all the boys except Michael slept in it , lying like sardines in a tin ."
"There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal , when all turned at once ."
"Michael should have used it also ; but Wendy would have a baby , and he was the littlest , and you know what women are , and the short and the long of it is that he was hung up in a basket ."
"It was rough and simple , and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances ."
"He too sprang high and well , but as he came down his heel just grazed the edge of the boat ."
"Dead silence reigned amidst the townsfolk , but Andras only laughed and said carelessly : ` Just a little too short , bailiff ; next time you must do better than that . '"
"The bailiff turned red with anger at his rival 's scornful words , and answered quickly : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '"
"And turning his back on his friends , he went sulkily home ."
"Andras , putting the money he had earned in his pocket , went home also ."
The following spring Andras happened to be driving his reindeer along a great fiord to the west of Vadso .
"A boy who had met him hastened to tell the bailiff that his enemy was only a few miles off ; and the bailiff , disguising himself as a Stalo , or ogre , called his son and his dog and rowed away across the fiord to the place where the boy had met Andras ."
"Now the mountaineer was lazily walking along the sands , thinking of the new hut that he was building with the money that he had won on the day of his lucky jump ."
"He wandered on , his eyes fixed on the sands , so that he did not see the bailiff drive his boat behind a rock , while he changed himself into a heap of wreckage which floated in on the waves ."
"A stumble over a stone recalled Andras to himself , and looking up he beheld the mass of wreckage ."
` Dear me !
"I may find some use for that , ' he said ; and hastened down to the sea , waiting till he could lay hold of some stray rope which might float towards him ."
"Suddenly -- he could not have told why -- a nameless fear seized upon him , and he fled away from the shore as if for his life ."
"As he ran he heard the sound of a pipe , such as only ogres of the Stalo kind were wont to use ; and there flashed into his mind what the bailiff had said when they jumped the boat : ` Next time you will have something harder to do . '"
"So it was no wreckage after all that he had seen , but the bailiff himself ."
"It happened that in the long summer nights up in the mountain , where the sun never set , and it was very difficult to get to sleep , Andras had spent many hours in the study of magic , and this stood him in good stead now ."
"The instant he heard the Stalo music he wished himself to become the feet of a reindeer , and in this guise he galloped like the wind for several miles ."
Then he stopped to take breath and find out what his enemy was doing .
"Nothing he could see , but to his ears the notes of a pipe floated over the plain , and ever , as he listened , it drew nearer ."
"A cold shiver shook Andras , and this time he wished himself the feet of a reindeer calf ."
For when a reindeer calf has reached the age at which he begins first to lose his hair he is so swift that neither beast nor bird can come near him .
A reindeer calf is the swiftest of all things living .
"Yes ; but not so swift as a Stalo , as Andras found out when he stopped to rest , and heard the pipe playing !"
"For a moment his heart sank , and he gave himself up for dead , till he remembered that , not far off , were two little lakes joined together by a short though very broad river ."
"In the middle of the river lay a stone that was always covered by water , except in dry seasons , and as the winter rains had been very heavy , he felt quite sure that not even the top of it could be seen ."
"The next minute , if anyone had been looking that way , he would have beheld a small reindeer calf speeding northwards , and by-and-by giving a great spring , which landed him in the midst of the stream ."
"But , instead of sinking to the bottom , he paused a second to steady himself , then gave a second spring which landed him on the further shore ."
"He next ran on to a little hill where he saw down and began to neigh loudly , so that the Stalo might know exactly where he was ."
` Ah !
"There you are , ' cried the Stalo , appearing on the opposite bank ; ` for a moment I really thought I had lost you . '"
"` No such luck , ' answered Andras , shaking his head sorrowfully ."
By this time he had taken his own shape again .
"There was no sign of the brig , which must have lifted from the reef and sunk ."
"The boat , too , was nowhere to be seen ."
There was never a sail upon the ocean ; and in what I could see of the land was neither house nor man .
"I was afraid to think what had befallen my shipmates , and afraid to look longer at so empty a scene ."
"What with my wet clothes and weariness , and my belly that now began to ache with hunger , I had enough to trouble me without that ."
"So I set off eastward along the south coast , hoping to find a house where I might warm myself , and perhaps get news of those I had lost ."
"And at the worst , I considered the sun would soon rise and dry my clothes ."
"After a little , my way was stopped by a creek or inlet of the sea , which seemed to run pretty deep into the land ; and as I had no means to get across , I must needs change my direction to go about the end of it ."
"It was still the roughest kind of walking ; indeed the whole , not only of Earraid , but of the neighbouring part of Mull -LRB- which they call the Ross -RRB- is nothing but a jumble of granite rocks with heather in among ."
At first the creek kept narrowing as I had looked to see ; but presently to my surprise it began to widen out again .
"At this I scratched my head , but had still no notion of the truth : until at last I came to a rising ground , and it burst upon me all in a moment that I was cast upon a little barren isle , and cut off on every side by the salt seas ."
"Instead of the sun rising to dry me , it came on to rain , with a thick mist ; so that my case was lamentable ."
"I stood in the rain , and shivered , and wondered what to do , till it occurred to me that perhaps the creek was fordable ."
Back I went to the narrowest point and waded in .
"But not three yards from shore , I plumped in head over ears ; and if ever I was heard of more , it was rather by God 's grace than my own prudence ."
"I was no wetter -LRB- for that could hardly be -RRB- , but I was all the colder for this mishap ; and having lost another hope was the more unhappy ."
"And now , all at once , the yard came in my head ."
What had carried me through the roost would surely serve me to cross this little quiet creek in safety .
"With that I set off , undaunted , across the top of the isle , to fetch and carry it back ."
"It was a weary tramp in all ways , and if hope had not buoyed me up , I must have cast myself down and given up ."
"Whether with the sea salt , or because I was growing fevered , I was distressed with thirst , and had to stop , as I went , and drink the peaty water out of the hags ."
"I came to the bay at last , more dead than alive ; and at the first glance , I thought the yard was something farther out than when I left it ."
"In I went , for the third time , into the sea ."
"The sand was smooth and firm , and shelved gradually down , so that I could wade out till the water was almost to my neck and the little waves splashed into my face ."
"But at that depth my feet began to leave me , and I durst venture in no farther ."
"As for the yard , I saw it bobbing very quietly some twenty feet beyond ."
"I had borne up well until this last disappointment ; but at that I came ashore , and flung myself down upon the sands and wept ."
"The time I spent upon the island is still so horrible a thought to me , that I must pass it lightly over ."
"In all the books I have read of people cast away , they had either their pockets full of tools , or a chest of things would be thrown upon the beach along with them , as if on purpose ."
My case was very different .
"I had nothing in my pockets but money and Alan 's silver button ; and being inland bred , I was as much short of knowledge as of means ."
"I knew indeed that shell-fish were counted good to eat ; and among the rocks of the isle I found a great plenty of limpets , which at first I could scarcely strike from their places , not knowing quickness to be needful ."
"He came nigh-hand fainting , doctor , when he heard the cry ."
Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us . ''
"I told my plan to the captain , and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment ."
"We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle , with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection ."
"Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port , and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins , muskets , bags of biscuits , kegs of pork , a cask of cognac , and my invaluable medicine chest ."
"In the meantime , the squire and the captain stayed on deck , and the latter hailed the coxswain , who was the principal man aboard ."
"`` Mr. Hands , '' he said , `` here are two of us with a brace of pistols each ."
"If any one of you six make a signal of any description , that man 's dead . ''"
"They were a good deal taken aback , and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion , thinking no doubt to take us on the rear ."
"But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley , they went about ship at once , and a head popped out again on deck ."
"`` Down , dog ! ''"
cries the captain .
"And the head popped back again ; and we heard no more , for the time , of these six very faint-hearted seamen ."
"By this time , tumbling things in as they came , we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared ."
"Joyce and I got out through the stern-port , and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us ."
This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore .
"`` Lillibullero '' was dropped again ; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point , one of them whipped ashore and disappeared ."
"I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats , but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand , and all might very well be lost by trying for too much ."
We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house .
"All three made the first journey , heavily laden , and tossed our stores over the palisade ."
"Then , leaving Joyce to guard them -- one man , to be sure , but with half a dozen muskets -- Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more ."
"So we proceeded without pausing to take breath , till the whole cargo was bestowed , when the two servants took up their position in the block house , and I , with all my power , sculled back to the HISPANIOLA ."
That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was .
"They had the advantage of numbers , of course , but we had the advantage of arms ."
"Not one of the men ashore had a musket , and before they could get within range for pistol shooting , we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least ."
"The squire was waiting for me at the stern window , all his faintness gone from him ."
"He caught the painter and made it fast , and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives ."
"Pork , powder , and biscuit was the cargo , with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain ."
"The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water , so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun , on the clean , sandy bottom ."
"By this time the tide was beginning to ebb , and the ship was swinging round to her anchor ."
"Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs ; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter , who were well to the eastward , it warned our party to be off ."
"Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat , which we then brought round to the ship 's counter , to be handier for Captain Smollett ."
"says I , quite cheerily ; but I was thinking in to myself : `` O , man , if you would only take one point of the compass and let me take any other , it would be the best for both of us . ''"
"`` Well , then , east , ye see , we have the muirs , '' said Alan ."
"`` Once there , David , it 's mere pitch-and-toss ."
"Out on yon bald , naked , flat place , where can a body turn to ?"
"Let the red-coats come over a hill , they can spy you miles away ; and the sorrow 's in their horses ' heels , they would soon ride you down ."
"It 's no good place , David ; and I 'm free to say , it 's worse by daylight than by dark . ''"
"`` Alan , '' said I , `` hear my way of it ."
"Appin 's death for us ; we have none too much money , nor yet meal ; the longer they seek , the nearer they may guess where we are ; it 's all a risk ; and I give my word to go ahead until we drop . ''"
Alan was delighted .
"`` There are whiles , '' said he , `` when ye are altogether too canny and Whiggish to be company for a gentleman like me ; but there come other whiles when ye show yoursel ' a mettle spark ; and it 's then , David , that I love ye like a brother . ''"
"The mist rose and died away , and showed us that country lying as waste as the sea ; only the moorfowl and the pewees crying upon it , and far over to the east , a herd of deer , moving like dots ."
"Much of it was red with heather ; much of the rest broken up with bogs and hags and peaty pools ; some had been burnt black in a heath fire ; and in another place there was quite a forest of dead firs , standing like skeletons ."
"A wearier-looking desert man never saw ; but at least it was clear of troops , which was our point ."
"We went down accordingly into the waste , and began to make our toilsome and devious travel towards the eastern verge ."
"There were the tops of mountains all round -LRB- you are to remember -RRB- from whence we might be spied at any moment ; so it behoved us to keep in the hollow parts of the moor , and when these turned aside from our direction to move upon its naked face with infinite care ."
"Sometimes , for half an hour together , we must crawl from one heather bush to another , as hunters do when they are hard upon the deer ."
"It was a clear day again , with a blazing sun ; the water in the brandy bottle was soon gone ; and altogether , if I had guessed what it would be to crawl half the time upon my belly and to walk much of the rest stooping nearly to the knees , I should certainly have held back from such a killing enterprise ."
"Toiling and resting and toiling again , we wore away the morning ; and about noon lay down in a thick bush of heather to sleep ."
Alan took the first watch ; and it seemed to me I had scarce closed my eyes before I was shaken up to take the second .
"We had no clock to go by ; and Alan stuck a sprig of heath in the ground to serve instead ; so that as soon as the shadow of the bush should fall so far to the east , I might know to rouse him ."
"But I was by this time so weary that I could have slept twelve hours at a stretch ; I had the taste of sleep in my throat ; my joints slept even when my mind was waking ; the hot smell of the heather , and the drone of the wild bees , were like possets to me ; and every now and again I would give a jump and find I had been dozing ."
"The last time I woke I seemed to come back from farther away , and thought the sun had taken a great start in the heavens ."
"I looked at the sprig of heath , and at that I could have cried aloud : for I saw I had betrayed my trust ."
"My head was nearly turned with fear and shame ; and at what I saw , when I looked out around me on the moor , my heart was like dying in my body ."
"For sure enough , a body of horse-soldiers had come down during my sleep , and were drawing near to us from the south-east , spread out in the shape of a fan and riding their horses to and fro in the deep parts of the heather ."
"When I waked Alan , he glanced first at the soldiers , then at the mark and the position of the sun , and knitted his brows with a sudden , quick look , both ugly and anxious , which was all the reproach I had of him ."
`` What are we to do now ? ''
I asked .
"`` We 'll have to play at being hares , '' said he ."
`` Do ye see yon mountain ? ''
pointing to one on the north-eastern sky .
"`` Ay , '' said I. `` Well , then , '' says he , `` let us strike for that ."
Cromwell and his Ironsides
"When Charles I came to the throne of England, it was soon seen that he was as bad a king as his father James I had been."
"He did not care at all for the good of his country and his people, but thought only of his own pleasure. He took away men's money and lands, and if they offended him he took their lives too."
"Englishmen would not bear this unjust treatment for long, and soon a war began between the king and the people, who were determined to be free."
"At first the king and his men were victorious everywhere, for they were all used to horses and arms, and fought so well and so bravely that the people could not stand against them. But at last a great leader arose among the people. This leader, who was called Oliver Cromwell, was a rough man, but he was just, good, and honest."
"He saw at once that the people would never gain the victory over the brave gentlemen-soldiers of King Charles, unless they had obedient and well-trained men to fight for them. So he chose a band of plain, hard-working men who feared God, and loved duty and right, and he spent all his money in fitting them with arms and horses, and in training them sternly, until they became the finest soldiers the world has ever known."
"Cromwell called his men his ""lovely company"", and others called them ""Ironsides"", for they were strong and firm as iron, and were never beaten. It was these brave, sober, obedient soldiers who at last defeated the king's army, and won freedom for the people of England."
The Spanish Armada
"The Armada was a great fleet which the King of Spain sent to attack England, in the days of Queen Elizabeth. There were more than a hundred ships, so large and high that they looked like towers on the sea; and they came sailing along arranged in the shape of a big half-moon."
"The great English admiral, Sir Francis Drake, was playing at bowls when messengers came hurrying to tell him that the Armada was approaching. He quietly finished his game, and then set sail to fight the Spaniards. His fleet was not so large as the Armada, and the ships were small, but they were light and fast. They met the Armada in the English Channel, and sailed round it, attacking any ship that dropped out of line, and speeding away before the clumsy Spanish vessels could seize them. In this way they did much harm to the enemy. Then, one night, when it was dark, and the Spanish vessels were lying quietly at anchor, Admiral Drake sent eight blazing fire-ships into their midst. In great fear, the Spaniards cut their anchor-ropes, and sailed out to the open sea, and the English ships followed, firing upon them as they fled. For two days the English chased the flying Spaniards. Then their powder and shot failed, and a storm arose; so they had to go back. The Armada sailed on, hoping to escape, but the wild tempest tossed many of the great vessels on the rocks and cliffs of the coast, and dashed them to pieces. Only a few, broken and battered, with starving and weary men on board, ever reached Spain again. And so England was saved."
The Defence of Lathom House
"Lathom House is an old English castle. When the war broke out between King Charles I and his people, the Earl of Derby, who was the master of this castle, went away to fight for the king. He left the Countess at home with her children, with a small band of armed men to guard her and the castle. One day an army of the people's soldiers came to the castle, and the leader of the army sent word to the Countess that she must give up the castle at once."
"The reason for shooting him stopped yesterday I heard Father say so so it wouldn't be fair, anyhow. I'm very sorry; but I can't so there!"""
"The sportsman said nothing, only he shook his fist at Jane, and then he got on the slide and tried to go toward the Crystal Palace which was not easy, because that way is uphill. So they left him trying, and went on."
"Before they started, the white grouse thanked them in a few pleasant, well-chosen words, and then they took a sideways slanting run and started off again on the great slide, and so away toward the North Pole and the twinkling, beautiful lights."
"The great slide went on and on, and the lights did not seem to come much nearer, and the white silence wrapped around them as they slid along the wide, icy path. Then once again the silence was broken to bits by someone calling: ""Hey! You there! Stop!"""
"""Tumble for your life!"" cried George, and tumbled as before, stopping in the only possible way, and Jane stopped on top of him, and they crawled to the edge and came suddenly on a butterfly collector, who was looking for specimens with a pair of blue glasses and a blue net and a blue book with colored plates."
"""Excuse me,"" said the collector, ""but have you such a thing as a needle about you a very long needle?"""
"""I have a needle book,"" replied Jane, politely, ""but there aren't any needles in it now. George took them all to do the things with pieces of cork in the 'Boy's Own Scientific Experimenter' and 'The Young Mechanic.' He did not do the things, but he did for the needles."""
"""Curiously enough,"" said the collector, ""I too wish to use the needle in connection with cork."""
"""I have a hatpin in my hood,"" said Jane. ""I fastened the fur with it when it caught in the nail on the greenhouse door. It is very long and sharp would that do?"""
"""One could but try,"" said the collector, and Jane began to feel for the pin. But George pinched her arm and whispered, ""Ask what he wants it for."" Then the collector had to own that he wanted the pin to stick through the great Arctic moth, ""a magnificent specimen,"" he added, ""which I am most anxious to preserve."""
"And there, sure enough, in the collector's butterfly net sat the great Arctic moth, listening attentively to the conversation."
"""Oh, I couldn't!"" cried Jane. And while George was explaining to the collector that they would really rather not, Jane opened the blue folds of the butterfly net, and asked the moth quietly if it would please step outside for a moment. And it did."
"When the collector saw that the moth was free, he seemed less angry than grieved."
"""Well, well,"" said he, ""here's a whole Arctic expedition thrown away! I shall have to go home and fit out another. And that means a lot of writing to the papers and things. You seem to be a singularly thoughtless little girl."""
"So they went on, leaving him too, trying to go uphill towards the Crystal Palace."
"When the great white Arctic moth had returned thanks in a suitable speech, George and Jane took a sideways slanting run and started sliding again, between the star-lamps along the great slide toward the North Pole. They went faster and faster, and the lights ahead grew brighter and brighter so that they could not keep their eyes open, but had to blink and wink as they went and then suddenly the great slide ended in an immense heap of snow, and George and Jane shot right into it because they could not stop themselves, and the snow was soft, so that they went in up to their very ears."
"When they had picked themselves out and thumped each other on the back to get rid of the snow, they shaded their eyes and looked, and there, right in front of them, was the wonder of wonders the North Pole towering high and white and glistening, like an ice-lighthouse, and it was quite, quite close, so that you had to put your head as far back as it would go, and farther, before you could see the high top of it. It was made entirely of ice. You will hear grown-up people talk a great deal of nonsense about the North Pole, and when you are grown up, it is even possible that you may talk nonsense about it yourself (the most unlikely things do happen) but deep down in your heart you must always remember that the North Pole is made of clear ice, and could not possibly, if you come to think of it, be made of anything else."
"All around the Pole, making a bright ring about it, were hundreds of little fires, and the flames of them did not flicker and twist, but went up blue and green and rosy and straight like the stalks of dream lilies."
"Jane said so, but George said they were as straight as ramrods."
"And these flames were the Aurora Borealis, which the children had seen as far away as Forest Hill."
"The ground was quite flat, and covered with smooth, hard snow, which shone and sparkled like the top of a birthday cake that has been iced at home. The ones done at the shops do not shine and sparkle, because they mix flour with the icing sugar."
"""It is like a dream,"" said Jane."
"And George said, ""It is the North Pole. Just think of the fuss people always make about getting here and it was no trouble at all, really."""
"""I daresay lots of people have gotten here,"" said Jane, dismally. ""It's not the getting here I see that it's the getting back again."
"Perhaps no one will ever know that we have been here, and the robins will cover us with leaves and """
"""Nonsense,"" said George. ""There aren't any robins, and there aren't any leaves. It's just the North Pole, that's all, and I've found it; and now I shall try to climb up and plant the British flag on the top my handkerchief will do; and if it really is the North Pole, my pocket compass Uncle James gave me will spin around and around, and then I shall know. Come on."""
"So Jane came on; and when they got close to the clear, tall, beautiful flames they saw that there was a great, queer-shaped lump of ice all around the bottom of the Pole clear, smooth, shining ice, that was deep, beautiful Prussian blue, like icebergs, in the thick parts, and all sorts of wonderful, glimmery, shimmery, changing colors in the thin parts, like the cut-glass chandelier in Grandmamma's house in London."
"""It is a very curious shape,"" said Jane. ""It's almost like"" she moved back a step to get a better view of it ""it's almost like a dragon."""
"""It's much more like the lampposts on the Thames Embankment,"" said George, who had noticed a curly thing like a tail that went twisting up the North Pole."
"""Oh, George,"" cried Jane, ""it is a dragon; I can see its wings."
"Whatever shall we do?"""
"And, sure enough, it was a dragon a great, shining, winged, scaly, clawy, big-mouthed dragon made of pure ice. It must have gone to sleep curled around the hole where the warm steam used to come up from the middle of the earth, and then when the earth got colder, and the column of steam froze and was turned into the North Pole, the dragon must have got frozen in his sleep frozen too hard to move and there he stayed."
"And the Snow Buntings and Juncos, who are bright and honest, nodded their dainty little heads and said, ""Nobody in our own dear north country ever spoke a truer word than that."" So they became firm friends of the Ground Hog, even if he were not so large as the rock."
THE END.
True Stories of Wonderful Deeds
The Royal Oak
"There is in Shropshire a fine oak-tree which the country people there call the ""Royal Oak"". They say it is the great-grandson, or perhaps the great-great-grandson of another fine old oak, which more than two hundred years ago stood on the same spot, and served once as a shelter to an English king. This king was Charles II, the son of the unlucky Charles I who had his head cut off by his subjects because he was a weak and selfish ruler."
"On the very day on which that unhappy king lost his head, the Parliament passed a law forbidding anyone to make his son, Prince Charles of Wales, or any other person, king of England. But the Scottish people did not obey this law. They persuaded the young prince to sign a paper, solemnly promising to rule the country as they wished; then they crowned him king. As soon as the Parliament heard of this they sent Cromwell and his Ironsides against the newly-crowned king and his followers, and after several battles the Scottish army was at last broken up and scattered at Worcester."
"Charles fled and hid in a wood, where some poor wood-cutters took care of him and helped him. He put on some of their clothes, cut his hair short, and stained his face and hands brown so that he might appear to be a sunburnt workman like them. But it was some time before he could escape from the wood, for Cromwell's soldiers were searching it in the hope of finding some of the king's men. One day, Charles and two of his friends had to climb into the tall oak to avoid being caught. They had with them some food, which proved very useful, for they were obliged to stay in their strange hiding-place for a whole day. The top of the oak-tree had been cut off some few years before this time, and this had made the lower branches grow thick and bushy, so that people walking below could not easily see through them. It was a fortunate thing for Charles, for while he was in the tree, he heard the soldiers beating the boughs and bushes in the wood as they searched here and there, and even caught glimpses of them through the leaves as they rode about below."
"When they had gone, without even glancing up into the tall oak-tree, he came down, and rode away from the wood on an old mill-horse, with his friends the wood-cutters walking beside him to take care of him as best they could. The saddle was a poor one, and the horse's pace jolted Charles so much, that at last he cried out that he had never seen so bad a steed. At this the owner of the horse jestingly told him that he should not find fault with the poor animal, which had never before carried the weight of three kingdoms upon its back. He meant, of course, that Charles was king of the three kingdoms of England, and Scotland, and Ireland."
"Carried by the old horse, and helped by the poor wood-cutters, Charles at last reached the house of a friend. Here he hid for a time, and then went on to try and escape from the country. This time, so that he might not be discovered, he was dressed as a servant, and rode on horseback, with a lady sitting on a cushion behind him, as was then the fashion."
After several more dangers he managed to get on board a ship and sailed away to France.
Bonnie Prince Charlie
"Prince Charlie was the grandson of King James II, who was driven away from the throne of England because he was a selfish man and a bad ruler."
"The young prince tried to win the crown back again. He came over to Scotland from France, with only seven followers; but soon a great many of the Scots joined him, for he was so gay, and handsome, and friendly, that all who saw him loved him. They called him ""Bonnie Prince Charlie""."
"But though the prince and his followers were very brave, they had no chance against the well-trained soldiers of King George of England. They won a few victories; then they were thoroughly beaten in the battle of Culloden. Thousands of brave Scots were slain, and the prince had to fly for his life."
"After this, for many weeks, he hid among the moors and mountains from the English soldiers who were trying to find him. He lived in small huts, or in caves, and many times had nothing but the wild berries from the woods to eat. Once he stayed for three weeks with a band of robbers, who were very kind to him; and though the king offered a large sum of money to anyone who would give him up, not one of his poor friends was false to him."
"At last, a young and beautiful Scottish lady, named Flora MacDonald, helped him to escape. She gave him woman's clothes, and pretended that he was her servant, called Betty Burke. Then she took him with her away from the place where the soldiers were searching, and after a time he reached the sea, and got safely away to France."
Nelson and Hardy
"Lord Nelson was one of the greatest seamen that ever lived. He commanded the British fleet at the battle of Trafalgar, when the navies of France and Spain were beaten, and England was saved from a great danger. He did not look like a famous admiral on board his ship, the Victory, that day. He was a small man, and his clothes were shabby. He had lost one arm and one eye in battle; but with the eye which remained he could see more than most men with two, and his brain was busy planning the course of the coming fight. Just before it began, he went over his ship, giving orders to the crew, and cheering them with kind words, which touched the hearts of the rough men, who loved their leader and were proud of him."
"""England expects every man to do his duty"" was the last message he sent them. Every man did his duty nobly that day, though the battle was fierce and long; but it was the last fight of the brave commander. He was shot in the back as he walked the deck with his friend Captain Hardy, and was carried below."
"He lay dying for several hours, but, in spite of his great pain, his one thought was of the battle. ""How goes the day with us?"" he asked of Hardy; and when told that many of the enemies' ships were taken, he cried eagerly, ""I am glad. Whip them, Hardy, as they have never been whipped before."" Later, when his friend came to tell him that the victory was won, Nelson pressed his hand. ""Good-bye, Hardy!"" said he, ""I have done my duty, and I thank God for it."" These were the last words of one of England's bravest sons."
Watt and the Kettle
"There was once a little Scotch boy named James Watt. He was not a strong child, and could not always run and play with other boys, but had often to amuse himself at home. One holiday afternoon little James amused himself in this way. He held a saucer over the stream of steam which came from the spout of a boiling kettle, and as he watched he saw little drops of water forming on the saucer. He thought this was very strange, and wondered why it happened, for he did not know that steam is just water changed in form by the heat, and that as soon as it touches something cold it turns again into water. He asked his aunt to explain it, but she only told him not to waste his time. If she could have foreseen the work which her nephew would do when he became a man, she would not have thought he was wasting his time."
"When James Watt grew up, he was as much interested in steam and its wonderful power, as he had been as a boy. He was sure it could be made of great service to men. It was already used for driving engines, but the engines were not good, and it cost much money to work them. Watt thought they could be improved, but it was long before he found out the way to do this. Often, he sat by the fire watching the lid of the kettle as it was made to dance by the steam, and thinking of many plans; and at last a happy thought came to him. His plan enabled great improvements to be made in the working of engines, and now steam drives our trains and ships, our mills and factories, and is one of our most useful servants."
Queen Victoria and her Soldiers
"Queen Victoria was always proud of her brave soldiers. In time of war, she gave orders that news of them was to be sent to her every day, and when the generals returned home, they were commanded to visit her, and to tell her of the bravery of the troops."
"During the long war with the Russians in the Crimea, the British soldiers suffered greatly from the freezing winds, and rain, and snow, of that cold land. When Queen Victoria heard of this, she and her children worked with their own hands to make warm clothing for them. A great many of the wounded and sick men were sent home in ships, to be nursed in the English hospitals, and the Queen paid several visits to the poor fellows as they lay there. Moving from one bed to another, she cheered them with hopeful words, and listened gladly to their stories of the battles in which they had fought. When she saw that the hospitals were crowded, and not very comfortable, she told Parliament that better ones ought to be provided, and after a time this was done, and the fine hospital of Netley was built, of which the Queen laid the first stone."
"""Hurry up,"" he said. ""Come down and lie still, can't you?"""
"So the rock with the round piece of earth fell into the sea, and the point of the rock went into a hole that just fitted it in the stony sea bottom, and there it spun around the wrong way seven times and then lay still. And that round piece of land became, after millions of years, the Kingdom of Rotundia."
"This is the end of the geography lesson. And now for just a little natural history, so that we may not feel that we are quite wasting our time. Of course, the consequence of the island having spun around the wrong way was that when the animals began to grow on the island they all grew the wrong sizes. The guinea pig, as you know, was as big as our elephants, and the elephant dear little pet was the size of the silly, tiny, black-and-tan dogs that ladies carry sometimes in their muffs. The rabbits were about the size of our rhinoceroses, and all about the wild parts of the island they had made their burrows as big as railway tunnels. The dormouse, of course, was the biggest of all the creatures."
"I can't tell you how big he was. Even if you think of elephants it will not help you at all. Luckily there was only one of him, and he was always asleep. Otherwise I don't think the Rotundians could have borne with him. As it was, they made him a house, and it saved the expense of a brass band, because no band could possibly have been heard when the dormouse was talking in his sleep."
"The men and women and children in this wonderful island were quite the right size, because their ancestors had come over with the Conqueror long after the island had settled down and the animals grown on it."
"Now the natural history lesson is over, and if you have been attending, you know more about Rotundia than anyone there did, except three people:"
"the Lord Chief Schoolmaster, the Princess's uncle who was a magician, and knew everything without learning it and Tom, the gardener's son."
"Tom had learned more at school than anyone else, because he wished to take a prize. The prize offered by the Lord Chief Schoolmaster was a History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the back. But after that day when the Princess said she meant to marry Tom, the gardener's boy thought it over, and he decided that the best prize in the world would be the Princess, and this was the prize Tom meant to take; and when you are a gardener's son and have decided to marry a Princess, you will find that the more you learn at school the better."
"The Princess always played with Tom on the days when the little dukes and marquises did not come to tea and when he told her he was almost sure of the first prize, she clapped her hands and said: ""Dear Tom, dear good, clever Tom, you deserve all the prizes. And I will give you my pet elephant and you can keep him till we're married."""
"The pet elephant was called Fido, and the gardener's son took him away in his coat pocket. He was the dearest little elephant you ever saw about six inches long. But he was very, very wise he could not have been wiser if he had been a mile high. He lay down comfortably in Tom's pocket, and when Tom put in his hand, Fido curled his little trunk around Tom's fingers with an affectionate confidence that made the boy's heart warm to his new little pet. What with the elephant, and the Princess's affection, and the knowledge that the very next day he would receive the History of Rotundia, beautifully bound, with the Royal arms on the cover, Tom could hardly sleep a wink. And, besides, the dog did bark so terribly. There was only one dog in Rotundia the kingdom could not afford to keep more than one: He was a Mexican lapdog of the kind that in most parts of the world only measures seven inches from the end of his dear nose to the tip of his darling tail but in Rotundia he was bigger than I can possibly expect you to believe. And when he barked, his bark was so large that it filled up all the night and left no room for sleep or dreams or polite conversation, or anything else at all. He never barked at things that went on in the island he was too large-minded for that; but when ships went blundering by in the dark, tumbling over the rocks at the end of the island, he would bark once or twice, just to let the ships know that they couldn't come playing about there just as they liked."
"But on this particular night he barked and barked and barked and the Princess said, ""Oh dear, oh dear, I wish he wouldn't, I am so sleepy."""
"And Tom said to himself, ""I wonder whatever is the matter. As soon as it's light I'll go and see."""
"So when it began to be pretty pink-and-yellow daylight, Tom got up and went out. And all the time the Mexican lapdog barked so that the houses shook, and the tiles on the roof of the palace rattled like milk cans in a cart whose horse is frisky."
"""I'll go to the pillar,"" thought Tom, as he went through the town. The pillar, of course, was the top of the piece of rock that had stuck itself through Rotundia millions of years before, and made it spin around the wrong way. It was quite in the middle of the island, and stuck up ever so far, and when you were at the top you could see a great deal farther than when you were not."
"As Tom went out from the town and across the downs, he thought what a pretty sight it was to see the rabbits in the bright, dewy morning, frisking with their young ones by the mouths of their burrows. He did not go very near the rabbits, of course, because when a rabbit of that size is at play it does not always look where it is going, and it might easily have crushed Tom with its foot, and then it would have been very sorry afterward. And Tom was a kind boy, and would not have liked to make even a rabbit unhappy. Earwigs in our country often get out of the way when they think you are going to walk on them. They too have kind hearts, and they would not like you to be sorry afterward."
"So Tom went on, looking at the rabbits and watching the morning grow more and more red and golden. And the Mexican lapdog barked all the time, till the church bells tinkled, and the chimney of the apple factory rocked again."
"But when Tom got to the pillar, he saw that he would not need to climb to the top to find out what the dog was barking at."
"For there, by the pillar, lay a very large purple dragon. His wings were like old purple umbrellas that have been very much rained on, and his head was large and bald, like the top of a purple toadstool, and his tail, which was purple too, was very, very, very long and thin and tight, like the lash of a carriage whip."
"It was licking one of its purple umbrella-y wings, and every now and then it moaned and leaned its head back against the rocky pillar as though it felt faint. Tom saw at once what had happened. A flight of purple dragons must have crossed the island in the night, and this poor one must have knocked its wing and broken it against the pillar."
"Everyone is kind to everyone in Rotundia, and Tom was not afraid of the dragon, although he had never spoken to one before. He had often watched them flying across the sea, but he had never expected to get to know one personally."
"So now he said: ""I am afraid you don't feel quite well."""
"The dragon shook his large purple head. He could not speak, but like all other animals, he could understand well enough when he liked."
"""Can I get you anything?"" asked Tom, politely."
The dragon opened his purple eyes with an inquiring smile.
"""A bun or two, now,"" said Tom, coaxingly. ""There's a beautiful bun tree quite close."""
"The dragon opened a great purple mouth and licked his purple lips, so Tom ran and shook the bun tree, and soon came back with an armful of fresh currant buns, and as he came he picked a few of the Bath kind, which grow on the low bushes near the pillar."
"Because, of course, another consequence of the island's having spun the wrong way is that all the things we have to make buns and cakes and shortbread grow on trees and bushes, but in Rotundia they have to make their cauliflowers and cabbages and carrots and apples and onions, just as our cooks make puddings and turnovers."
"Tom gave all the buns to the dragon, saying: ""Here, try to eat a little."
"You'll soon feel better then."""
"The dragon ate up the buns, nodded rather ungraciously, and began to lick his wing again. So Tom left him and went back to the town with the news, and everyone was so excited at a real live dragon's being on the island a thing that had never happened before that they all went out to look at it, instead of going to the prize-giving, and the Lord Chief Schoolmaster went with the rest. Now, he had Tom's prize, the History of Rotundia, in his pocket the one bound in calf, with the Royal arms on the cover and it happened to drop out, and the dragon ate it, so Tom never got the prize after all. But the dragon, when he had gotten it, did not like it."
"""Perhaps it's all for the best,"" said Tom. ""I might not have liked that prize either, if I had gotten it."""
"It happened to be a Wednesday, so when the Princess's friends were asked what they would like to do, all the little dukes and marquises and earls said, ""Let's go and see the dragon."" But the little duchesses and marchionesses and countesses said they were afraid."
"""Who run?"" inquired Wolfe."
"""The French! The French!"" came the reply."
"""Now God be praised,"" said Wolfe, ""I die happy."""
"Montcalm had a similar experience. He was fatally wounded. ""They run!"
"They run!"" he heard some one say."
"""Who run?"" exclaimed Montcalm, wetting his lips with a lemonade-glass of cognac."
"""We do,"" replied the man."
"""Then so much the better,"" said Montcalm, as his eye lighted up, ""for I shall not live to see Quebec surrendered."""
This shows what can be done without a rehearsal; also how the historian has to control himself in order to avoid lying.
"The death of these two brave men is a beautiful and dramatic incident in the history of our country, and should be remembered by every school-boy, because neither lived to write articles criticising the other."
"Five days later the city capitulated. An attempt was made to recapture it, but it was not successful. Canada fell into the hands of the English, and from the open Polar Sea to the Mississippi the English flag floated."
What an empire!
What a game-preserve!
"Florida was now ceded to the already cedy crown of England by Spain, and brandy-and-soda for the wealthy and bitter beer became the drink of the poor."
"Pontiac's War was brought on by the Indians, who preferred the French occupation to that of the English. Pontiac organized a large number of tribes on the spoils plan, and captured eight forts. He killed a great many people, burned their dwellings, and drove out many more, but at last his tribes made trouble, as there were not spoils enough to go around, and his army was conquered. He was killed in 1769 by an Indian who received for his trouble a barrel of liquor, with which he began to make merry. He remained by the liquor till death came to his relief."
"The heroism of an Indian who meets his enemy single-handed in that way, and, though greatly outnumbered, dies with his face to the foe, is deserving of more than a passing notice."
"The French and Indian War cost the Colonists sixteen million dollars, of which the English repaid only five million. The Americans lost thirty thousand men, none of whom were replaced. They suffered every kind of horror and barbarity, written and unwritten, and for years their taxes were two-thirds of their income; and yet they did not murmur."
"These were the fathers and mothers of whom we justly brag. These were the people whose children we are. What are inherited titles and ancient names many times since dishonored, compared with the heritage of uncomplaining suffering and heroism which we boast of to-day because those modest martyrs were working people, proud that by the sweat of their brows they wrung from a niggardly soil the food they ate, proud also that they could leave the plough to govern or to legislate, able also to survey a county or rule a nation."
CHAPTER XII.
PERSONALITY OF WASHINGTON.
It would seem that a few personal remarks about George Washington at this point might not be out of place. Later on his part in this history will more fully appear.
"The author points with some pride to a study of Washington's great act in crossing the Delaware, from a wax-work of great accuracy. The reader will avoid confusing Washington with the author, who is dressed in a plaid suit and on the shore, while Washington may be seen in this end of the boat with the air of one who has just discovered the location of a glue-factory on the side of the river."
"A directory of Washington's head-quarters has been arranged by the author of this book, and at a reunion of the general's body-servants to be held in the future the work will be on sale."
The name of George Washington has always had about it a glamour that made him appear more in the light of a god than a tall man with large feet and a mouth made to fit an old-fashioned full-dress pumpkin pie.
"George Washington's face has beamed out upon us for many years now, on postage-stamps and currency, in marble and plaster and in bronze, in photographs of original portraits, paintings, and stereoscopic views. We have seen him on horseback and on foot, on the war-path and on skates, playing the flute, cussing his troops for their shiftlessness, and then, in the solitude of the forest, with his snorting war-horse tied to a tree, engaged in prayer."
"We have seen all these pictures of George, till we are led to believe that he did not breathe our air or eat American groceries. But George Washington was not perfect. I say this after a long and careful study of his life, and I do not say it to detract the very smallest iota from the proud history of the Father of his Country. I say it simply that the boys of America who want to become George Washingtons will not feel so timid about trying it."
"When I say that George Washington, who now lies so calmly in the lime-kiln at Mount Vernon, could reprimand and reproach his subordinates, at times, in a way to make the ground crack open and break up the ice in the Delaware a week earlier than usual, I do not mention it in order to show the boys of our day that profanity will make them resemble George Washington. That was one of his weak points, and no doubt he was ashamed of it, as he ought to have been. Some poets think that if they get drunk and stay drunk they will resemble Edgar A. Poe and George D. Prentice. There are lawyers who play poker year after year and get regularly skinned because they have heard that some of the able lawyers of the past century used to come home at night with poker-chips in their pockets."
"""Quite,"" said the Princess. ""I only wish I were half as sure that he wouldn't hurt you."""
"""My Princess,"" he said tenderly, ""two great powers are on our side: the power of Love and the power of Arithmetic. Those two are stronger than anything else in the world."""
"So when the tide began to go down, Nigel and the Princess ran out on to the sands, and there, in full sight of the terrace where the dragon kept watch, Nigel took his Princess in his arms and kissed her. The griffin was busy sweeping the stairs of the Lone Tower, but the dragon saw, and he gave a cry of rage and it was like twenty engines all letting off steam at the top of their voices inside Cannon Street Station."
"And the two lovers stood looking up at the dragon. He was dreadful to look at. His head was white with age and his beard had grown so long that he caught his claws in it as he walked. His wings were white with the salt that had settled on them from the spray of the sea. His tail was long and thick and jointed and white, and had little legs to it, any number of them far too many so that it looked like a very large fat silkworm; and his claws were as long as lessons and as sharp as bayonets."
"""Good-bye, love!"" cried Nigel, and ran out across the yellow sand toward the sea. He had one end of a cord tied to his arm."
"The dragon was clambering down the face of the cliff, and next moment he was crawling and writhing and sprawling and wriggling across the beach after Nigel, making great holes in the sand with his heavy feet and the very end of his tail, where there were no legs, made, as it dragged, a mark in the sand such as you make when you launch a boat; and he breathed fire till the wet sand hissed again, and the water of the little rock pools got quite frightened, and all went off in steam."
"Still Nigel held on and the dragon after him. The Princess could see nothing for the steam, and she stood crying bitterly, but still holding on tight with her right hand to the other end of the cord that Nigel had told her to hold; while with her left she held the ship's chronometer, and looked at it through her tears as he had bidden her look, so as to know when to pull the rope."
"On went Nigel over the sand, and on went the dragon after him. And the tide was low, and sleepy little waves lapped the sand's edge."
"Now at the lip of the water, Nigel paused and looked back, and the dragon made a bound, beginning a scream of rage that was like all the engines of all the railways in England. But it never uttered the second half of that scream, for now it knew suddenly that it was sleepy it turned to hurry back to dry land, because sleeping near whirlpools is so unsafe. But before it reached the shore sleep caught it and turned it to stone. Nigel, seeing this, ran shoreward for his life and the tide began to flow in, and the time of the whirlpools' sleep was nearly over, and he stumbled and he waded and he swam, and the Princess pulled for dear life at the cord in her hand, and pulled him up on to the dry shelf of rock just as the great sea dashed in and made itself once more into the girdle of Nine Whirlpools all around the island."
"But the dragon was asleep under the whirlpools, and when he woke up from being asleep he found he was drowned, so there was an end of him."
"""Now, there's only the griffin,"" said Nigel. And the Princess said:"
"""Yes only "" And she kissed Nigel and went back to sew the last leaf of the last lily on the bosom of her wedding gown. She thought and thought of what was written on the stone about the griffin being artificial and next day she said to Nigel: ""You know a griffin is half a lion and half an eagle, and the other two halves when they've joined make the leo-griff. But I've never seen him. Yet I have an idea."""
So they talked it over and arranged everything.
"When the griffin fell asleep that afternoon at teatime, Nigel went softly behind him and trod on his tail, and at the same time the Princess cried: ""Look out! There's a lion behind you."""
"And the griffin, waking suddenly from his dreams, twisted his large neck around to look for the lion, saw a lion's flank, and fastened its eagle beak in it. For the griffin had been artificially made by the King-enchanter, and the two halves had never really got used to each other. So now the eagle half of the griffin, who was still rather sleepy, believed that it was fighting a lion, and the lion part, being half asleep, thought it was fighting an eagle, and the whole griffin in its deep drowsiness hadn't the sense to pull itself together and remember what it was made of. So the griffin rolled over and over, one end of it fighting with the other, till the eagle end pecked the lion end to death, and the lion end tore the eagle end with its claws till it died. And so the griffin that was made of a lion and an eagle perished, exactly as if it had been made of Kilkenny cats."
"""Poor griffin,"" said the Princess, ""it was very good at the housework. I always liked it better than the dragon: It wasn't so hot-tempered."""
"At that moment there was a soft, silky rush behind the Princess, and there was her mother, the Queen, who had slipped out of the stone statue at the moment the griffin was dead, and now came hurrying to take her dear daughter in her arms. The witch was clambering slowly off her pedestal. She was a little stiff from standing still so long."
"When they had all explained everything over and over to each other as many times as was good for them, the witch said: ""Well, but what about the whirlpools?"""
"And Nigel said he didn't know. Then the witch said: ""I'm not a witch anymore. I'm only a happy old woman, but I know some things still. Those whirlpools were made by the enchanter-King's dropping nine drops of his blood into the sea. And his blood was so wicked that the sea has been trying ever since to get rid of it, and that made the whirlpools. Now you've only got to go out at low tide."""
"So Nigel understood and went out at low tide, and found in the sandy hollow left by the first whirlpool a great red ruby. That was the first drop of the wicked King's blood. The next day Nigel found another, and next day another, and so on till the ninth day, and then the sea was as smooth as glass."
"The nine rubies were used afterwards in agriculture. You had only to throw them out into a field if you wanted it plowed. Then the whole surface of the land turned itself over in its anxiety to get rid of something so wicked, and in the morning the field was found to be plowed as thoroughly as any young man at Oxford. So the wicked King did some good after all."
"When the sea was smooth, ships came from far and wide, bringing people to hear the wonderful story. And a beautiful palace was built, and the Princess was married to Nigel in her gold dress, and they all lived happily as long as was good for them."
"The dragon still lies, a stone dragon on the sand, and at low tide the little children play around him and over him. But the pieces that were left of the griffin were buried under the herb-bed in the palace garden, because it had been so good at housework, and it wasn't its fault that it had been made so badly and put to such poor work as guarding a lady from her lover."
"I have no doubt that you will wish to know what the Princess lived on during the long years when the dragon did the cooking. My dear, she lived on her income and that is a thing that a great many people would like to be able to do."
THE DRAGON TAMERS]
VI. The Dragon Tamers
"There was once an old, old castle it was so old that its walls and towers and turrets and gateways and arches had crumbled to ruins, and of all its old splendor there were only two little rooms left; and it was here that John the blacksmith had set up his forge. He was too poor to live in a proper house, and no one asked any rent for the rooms in the ruin, because all the lords of the castle were dead and gone this many a year. So there John blew his bellows and hammered his iron and did all the work which came his way. This was not much, because most of the trade went to the mayor of the town, who was also a blacksmith in quite a large way of business, and had his huge forge facing the square of the town, and had twelve apprentices, all hammering like a nest of woodpeckers, and twelve journeymen to order the apprentices about, and a patent forge and a self-acting hammer and electric bellows, and all things handsome about him. So of course the townspeople, whenever they wanted a horse shod or a shaft mended, went to the mayor. John the blacksmith struggled on as best he could, with a few odd jobs from travelers and strangers who did not know what a superior forge the mayor's was. The two rooms were warm and weather-tight, but not very large; so the blacksmith got into the way of keeping his old iron, his odds and ends, his fagots, and his twopence worth of coal in the great dungeon down under the castle. It was a very fine dungeon indeed, with a handsome vaulted roof and big iron rings whose staples were built into the wall, very strong and convenient for tying captives to, and at one end was a broken flight of wide steps leading down no one knew where."
"Even the lords of the castle in the good old times had never known where those steps led to, but every now and then they would kick a prisoner down the steps in their lighthearted, hopeful way, and sure enough, the prisoners never came back. The blacksmith had never dared to go beyond the seventh step, and no more have I so I know no more than he did what was at the bottom of those stairs."
"John the blacksmith had a wife and a little baby. When his wife was not doing the housework she used to nurse the baby and cry, remembering the happy days when she lived with her father, who kept seventeen cows and lived quite in the country, and when John used to come courting her in the summer evenings, as smart as smart, with a posy in his buttonhole."
"And now John's hair was getting gray, and there was hardly ever enough to eat."
"said the soldier, “I should very much like to see what my father is doing at home.” The Devil said, “In order that you may receive the wages you have earned, go and fill your knapsack full of the sweepings, and take it home with you. You must also go unwashed and uncombed, with long hair on your head and beard, and with uncut nails and dim eyes, and when you are asked whence you come, you must say, “From hell,” and when you are asked who you are, you are to say, “The Devil’s sooty brother, and my King as well.” The soldier held his peace, and did as the Devil bade him, but he was not at all satisfied with his wages."
"Then as soon as he was up in the forest again, he took his knapsack from his back, to empty it, but on opening it, the sweepings had become pure gold. “I should never have expected that,” said he, and was well pleased, and entered the town. The landlord was standing in front of the inn, and when he saw the soldier approaching, he was terrified, because Hans looked so horrible, worse than a scare-crow. He called to him and asked, “Whence comest thou?” “From hell.” “Who art thou?” “The Devil’s sooty brother, and my King as well.” Then the host would not let him enter, but when Hans showed him the gold, he came and unlatched the door himself. Hans then ordered the best room and attendance, ate, and drank his fill, but neither washed nor combed himself as the Devil had bidden him, and at last lay down to sleep. But the knapsack full of gold remained before the eyes of the landlord, and left him no peace, and during the night he crept in and stole it away. Next morning, however, when Hans got up and wanted to pay the landlord and travel further, behold his knapsack was gone! But he soon composed himself and thought, “Thou hast been unfortunate from no fault of thine own,” and straightway went back again to hell, complained of his misfortune to the old Devil, and begged for his help. The Devil said, “Seat yourself, I will wash, comb, and trim you, cut your hair and nails, and wash your eyes for you,” and when he had done with him, he gave him the knapsack back again full of sweepings, and said, “Go and tell the landlord that he must return you your money, or else I will come and fetch him, and he shall poke the fire in your place.” Hans went up and said to the landlord, “Thou hast stolen my money; if thou dost not return it, thou shalt go down to hell in my place, and wilt look as horrible as I.”"
"Then the landlord gave him the money, and more besides, only begging him to keep it secret, and Hans was now a rich man."
"He set out on his way home to his father, bought himself a shabby smock-frock to wear, and strolled about making music, for he had learned to do that while he was with the Devil in hell. There was however, an old King in that country, before whom he had to play, and the King was so delighted with his playing, that he promised him his eldest daughter in marriage. But when she heard that she was to be married to a common fellow in a smock-frock, she said, “Rather than do that, I would go into the deepest water.” Then the King gave him the youngest, who was quite willing to do it to please her father, and thus the Devil’s sooty brother got the King’s daughter, and when the aged King died, the whole kingdom likewise."
101 Bearskin
"There was once a young fellow who enlisted as a soldier, conducted himself bravely, and was always the foremost when it rained bullets. So long as the war lasted, all went well, but when peace was made, he received his dismissal, and the captain said he might go where he liked. His parents were dead, and he had no longer a home, so he went to his brothers and begged them to take him in, and keep him until war broke out again. The brothers, however, were hard-hearted and said, “What can we do with thee? thou art of no use to us; go and make a living for thyself.” The soldier had nothing left but his gun; he took that on his shoulder, and went forth into the world. He came to a wide heath, on which nothing was to be seen but a circle of trees; under these he sat sorrowfully down, and began to think over his fate. “I have no money,” thought he, “I have learnt no trade but that of fighting, and now that they have made peace they don’t want me any longer; so I see beforehand that I shall have to starve.” All at once he heard a rustling, and when he looked round, a strange man stood before him, who wore a green coat and looked right stately, but had a hideous cloven foot. “I know already what thou art in need of,” said the man; “gold and possessions shall thou have, as much as thou canst make away with do what thou wilt, but first I must know if thou art fearless, that I may not bestow my money in vain.” “A soldier and fear—how can those two things go together?” he answered; “thou canst put me to the proof.” “Very well, then,” answered the man, “look behind thee.” The soldier turned round, and saw a large bear, which came growling towards him. “Oho!” cried the soldier, “I will tickle thy nose for thee, so that thou shalt soon lose thy fancy for growling,” and he aimed at the bear and shot it through the muzzle; it fell down and never stirred again. “I see quite well,” said the stranger, “that thou art not wanting in courage, but there is still another condition which thou wilt have to fulfil.” “If it does not endanger my salvation,”"
"replied the soldier, who knew very well who was standing by him. “If it does, I’ll have nothing to do with it.” “Thou wilt look to that for thyself,” answered Greencoat; “thou shalt for the next seven years neither wash thyself, nor comb thy beard, nor thy hair, nor cut thy nails, nor say one paternoster. I will give thee a coat and a cloak, which during this time thou must wear. If thou diest during these seven years, thou art mine; if thou remainest alive, thou art free, and rich to boot, for all the rest of thy life.” The soldier thought of the great extremity in which he now found himself, and as he so often had gone to meet death, he resolved to risk it now also, and agreed to the terms. The Devil took off his green coat, gave it to the soldier, and said, “If thou hast this coat on thy back and puttest thy hand into the pocket, thou wilt always find it full of money.” Then he pulled the skin off the bear and said, “This shall be thy cloak, and thy bed also, for thereon shalt thou sleep, and in no other bed shalt thou lie, and because of this apparel shalt thou be called Bearskin.” After this the Devil vanished."
"The soldier put the coat on, felt at once in the pocket, and found that the thing was really true. Then he put on the bearskin and went forth into the world, and enjoyed himself, refraining from nothing that did him good and his money harm. During the first year his appearance was passable, but during the second he began to look like a monster. His hair covered nearly the whole of his face, his beard was like a piece of coarse felt, his fingers had claws, and his face was so covered with dirt that if cress had been sown on it, it would have come up."
"Whosoever saw him, ran away, but as he everywhere gave the poor money to pray that he might not die during the seven years, and as he paid well for everything he still always found shelter. In the fourth year, he entered an inn where the landlord would not receive him, and would not even let him have a place in the stable, because he was afraid the horses would be scared. But as Bearskin thrust his hand into his pocket and pulled out a handful of ducats, the host let himself be persuaded and gave him a room in an outhouse. Bearskin was, however, obliged to promise not to let himself be seen, lest the inn should get a bad name."
"As Bearskin was sitting alone in the evening, and wishing from the bottom of his heart that the seven years were over, he heard a loud lamenting in a neighboring room. He had a compassionate heart, so he opened the door, and saw an old man weeping bitterly, and wringing his hands. Bearskin went nearer, but the man sprang to his feet and tried to escape from him. At last when the man perceived that Bearskin’s voice was human he let himself be prevailed on, and by kind words bearskin succeeded so far that the old man revealed the cause of his grief. His property had dwindled away by degrees, he and his daughters would have to starve, and he was so poor that he could not pay the innkeeper, and was to be put in prison. “If that is your only trouble,”"
"said Bearskin, “I have plenty of money.” He caused the innkeeper to be brought thither, paid him and put a purse full of gold into the poor old man’s pocket besides."
"When the old man saw himself set free from all his troubles he did not know how to be grateful enough. “Come with me,” said he to Bearskin; “my daughters are all miracles of beauty, choose one of them for thyself as a wife. When she hears what thou hast done for me, she will not refuse thee. Thou dost in truth look a little strange, but she will soon put thee to rights again.” This pleased Bearskin well, and he went. When the eldest saw him she was so terribly alarmed at his face that she screamed and ran away. The second stood still and looked at him from head to foot, but then she said, “How can I accept a husband who no longer has a human form? The shaven bear that once was here and passed itself off for a man pleased me far better, for at any rate it wore a hussar’s dress and white gloves. If it were nothing but ugliness, I might get used to that.” The youngest, however, said, “Dear father, that must be a good man to have helped you out of your trouble, so if you have promised him a bride for doing it, your promise must be kept.” It was a pity that Bearskin’s face was covered with dirt and with hair, for if not they might have seen how delighted he was when he heard these words. He took a ring from his finger, broke it in two, and gave her one half, the other he kept for himself. He wrote his name, however, on her half, and hers on his, and begged her to keep her piece carefully, and then he took his leave and said, “I must still wander about for three years, and if I do not return then, thou art free, for I shall be dead. But pray to God to preserve my life.”"
"The poor betrothed bride dressed herself entirely in black, and when she thought of her future bridegroom, tears came into her eyes. Nothing but contempt and mockery fell to her lot from her sisters. “Take care,”"
"said the eldest, “if thou givest him thy hand, he will strike his claws into it.” “Beware!” said the second. “Bears like sweet things, and if he takes a fancy to thee, he will eat thee up.” “Thou must always do as he likes,” began the elder again, “or else he will growl.” And the second continued, “But the wedding will be a merry one, for bears dance well.” The bride was silent, and did not let them vex her. Bearskin, however, travelled about the world from one place to another, did good where he was able, and gave generously to the poor that they might pray for him."
"At length, as the last day of the seven years dawned, he went once more out on to the heath, and seated himself beneath the circle of trees. It was not long before the wind whistled, and the Devil stood before him and looked angrily at him; then he threw Bearskin his old coat, and asked for his own green one back. “We have not got so far as that yet,”"
"answered Bearskin, “thou must first make me clean.” Whether the Devil liked it or not, he was forced to fetch water, and wash Bearskin, comb his hair, and cut his nails. After this, he looked like a brave soldier, and was much handsomer than he had ever been before."
"When the Devil had gone away, Bearskin was quite lighthearted. He went into the town, put on a magnificent velvet coat, seated himself in a carriage drawn by four white horses, and drove to his bride’s house. No one recognized him, the father took him for a distinguished general, and led him into the room where his daughters were sitting. He was forced to place himself between the two eldest, they helped him to wine, gave him the best pieces of meat, and thought that in all the world they had never seen a handsomer man. The bride, however, sat opposite to him in her black dress, and never raised her eyes, nor spoke a word. When at length he asked the father if he would give him one of his daughters to wife, the two eldest jumped up, ran into their bedrooms to put on splendid dresses, for each of them fancied she was the chosen one. The stranger, as soon as he was alone with his bride, brought out his half of the ring, and threw it in a glass of wine which he reached across the table to her. She took the wine, but when she had drunk it, and found the half ring lying at the bottom, her heart began to beat. She got the other half, which she wore on a ribbon round her neck, joined them, and saw that the two pieces fitted exactly together."
"Then said he, “I am thy betrothed bridegroom, whom thou sawest as Bearskin, but through God’s grace I have again received my human form, and have once more become clean.” He went up to her, embraced her, and gave her a kiss. In the meantime the two sisters came back in full dress, and when they saw that the handsome man had fallen to the share of the youngest, and heard that he was Bearskin, they ran out full of anger and rage. One of them drowned herself in the well, the other hanged herself on a tree. In the evening, some one knocked at the door, and when the bridegroom opened it, it was the Devil in his green coat, who said, “Seest thou, I have now got two souls in the place of thy one!”"
102 The Willow-Wren and the Bear
"Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest, and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said, “Brother wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?” “That is the King of birds,”"
"said the wolf, “before whom we must bow down.” It was, however, in reality the willow-wren (Zaunkönig). “If that’s the case,” said the bear, “I should very much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.” “That is not done quite as you seem to think,” said the wolf; “you must wait until the Queen comes.” Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him back by the sleeve, and said, “No, you must wait until the lord and lady Queen have gone away again.” So they observed the hole in which was the nest, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, again went to it. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw five or six young ones lying in it."
"“Is that the royal palace?” cried the bear; “it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you are disreputable children!” When the young wrens heard that, they were frightfully angry, and screamed, “No, that we are not! Our parents are honest people! Bear, thou wilt have to pay for that!”"
"The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and when their parents again brought food they said, “We will not so much as touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been here and has insulted us!” Then the old King said, “Be easy, he shall be punished,” and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and called in, “Old Growler, why hast thou insulted my children?"
"Thou shalt suffer for it we will punish thee by a bloody war.” Thus war was announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and flies had to come."
"When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled, and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the watchword was to be given. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him and said, “Fox, thou art the most cunning of all animals, thou shalt be general and lead us.” “Good,” said the fox, “but what signal shall we agree upon?” No one knew that, so the fox said, “I have a fine long bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.” When the gnat had heard that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, with the greatest minuteness, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin, all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the earth trembled. The willow-wren also came flying through the air with his army with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to get beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might."
"When the fox felt the first sting, he started so that he drew up one leg, with the pain, but he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could hold out no longer, and screamed out and put his tail between his legs. When the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to fly, each into his hole and the birds had won the battle."
"Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried, “Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won the battle!” But the young wrens said, “We will not eat yet, the bear must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honorable children, before we will do that.” Then the willow-wren flew to the bear’s hole and cried, “Growler, thou art to come to the nest to my children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of thy body shall be broken.” So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the night."
103 Sweet Porridge
"There was a poor but good little girl who lived alone with her mother, and they no longer had anything to eat. So the child went into the forest, and there an aged woman met her who was aware of her sorrow, and presented her with a little pot, which when she said, “Cook, little pot, cook,” would cook good, sweet porridge, and when she said, “Stop, little pot,” it ceased to cook. The girl took the pot home to her mother, and now they were freed from their poverty and hunger, and ate sweet porridge as often as they chose. Once on a time when the girl had gone out, her mother said, “Cook, little pot, cook.” And it did cook and she ate till she was satisfied, and then she wanted the pot to stop cooking, but did not know the word. So it went on cooking and the porridge rose over the edge, and still it cooked on until the kitchen and whole house were full, and then the next house, and then the whole street, just as if it wanted to satisfy the hunger of the whole world, and there was the greatest distress, but no one knew how to stop it. At last when only one single house remained, the child came home and just said, “Stop, little pot,” and it stopped and gave up cooking, and whosoever wished to return to the town had to eat his way back."
104 Wise Folks
"One day a peasant took his good hazel-stick out of the corner and said to his wife, “Trina, I am going across country, and shall not return for three days. If during that time the cattle-dealer should happen to call and want to buy our three cows, you may strike a bargain at once, but not unless you can get two hundred thalers for them; nothing less, do you hear?” “For heaven’s sake just go in peace,” answered the woman, “I will manage that.” “You, indeed,” said the man. “You once fell on your head when you were a little child, and that affects you even now; but let me tell you this, if you do anything foolish, I will make your back black and blue, and not with paint, I assure you, but with the stick which I have in my hand, and the colouring shall last a whole year, you may rely on that.” And having said that, the man went on his way."
"Next morning the cattle-dealer came, and the woman had no need to say many words to him. When he had seen the cows and heard the price, he said, “I am quite willing to give that, honestly speaking, they are worth it. I will take the beasts away with me at once.” He unfastened their chains and drove them out of the byre, but just as he was going out of the yard-door, the woman clutched him by the sleeve and said, “You must give me the two hundred thalers now, or I cannot let the cows go.” “True,” answered the man, “but I have forgotten to buckle on my money-belt. Have no fear, however, you shall have security for my paying. I will take two cows with me and leave one, and then you will have a good pledge.” The woman saw the force of this, and let the man go away with the cows, and thought to herself, “How pleased Hans will be when he finds how cleverly I have managed it!” The peasant came home on the third day as he had said he would, and at once inquired if the cows were sold? “Yes, indeed, dear Hans,” answered the woman, “and as you said, for two hundred thalers. They are scarcely worth so much, but the man took them without making any objection.” “Where is the money?”"
"The giant instantly snatched the ring, and ran away with it, but the lion, which had observed the theft, pursued the giant, tore the ring out of his hand, and brought it back to its master. Then the giant placed himself behind an oak-tree, and while the King’s son was busy putting on his clothes again, surprised him, and put both his eyes out."
"And now the unhappy King’s son stood there, and was blind and knew not how to help himself. Then the giant came back to him, took him by the hand as if he were someone who wanted to guide him, and led him to the top of a high rock. There he left him standing, and thought, “Just two steps more, and he will fall down and kill himself, and I can take the ring from him.” But the faithful lion had not deserted its master; it held him fast by the clothes, and drew him gradually back again. When the giant came and wanted to rob the dead man, he saw that his cunning had been in vain. “Is there no way, then, of destroying a weak child of man like that?” said he angrily to himself, and seized the King’s son and led him back again to the precipice by another way, but the lion which saw his evil design, helped its master out of danger here also."
"When they had got close to the edge, the giant let the blind man’s hand drop, and was going to leave him behind alone, but the lion pushed the giant so that he was thrown down and fell, dashed to pieces, on the ground."
"The faithful animal again drew its master back from the precipice, and guided him to a tree by which flowed a clear brook. The King’s son sat down there, but the lion lay down, and sprinkled the water in his face with its paws. Scarcely had a couple of drops wetted the sockets of his eyes, than he was once more able to see something, and remarked a little bird flying quite close by, which wounded itself against the trunk of a tree. On this it went down to the water and bathed itself therein, and then it soared upwards and swept between the trees without touching them, as if it had recovered its sight again. Then the King’s son recognized a sign from God and stooped down to the water, and washed and bathed his face in it. And when he arose he had his eyes once more, brighter and clearer than they had ever been."
"The King’s son thanked God for his great mercy, and travelled with his lion onwards through the world. And it came to pass that he arrived before a castle which was enchanted. In the gateway stood a maiden of beautiful form and fine face, but she was quite black. She spoke to him and said, “Ah, if thou couldst but deliver me from the evil spell which is thrown over me.” “What shall I do?” said the King’s son. The maiden answered, “Thou must pass three nights in the great hall of this enchanted castle, but thou must let no fear enter thy heart. When they are doing their worst to torment thee, if thou bearest it without letting a sound escape thee, I shall be free. Thy life they dare not take.” Then said the King’s son, “I have no fear; with God’s help I will try it.” So he went gaily into the castle, and when it grew dark he seated himself in the large hall and waited. Everything was quiet, however, till midnight, when all at once a great tumult began, and out of every hole and corner came little devils. They behaved as if they did not see him, seated themselves in the middle of the room, lighted a fire, and began to gamble. When one of them lost, he said, “It is not right; some one is here who does not belong to us; it is his fault that I am losing.” “Wait, you fellow behind the stove, I am coming,” said another. The screaming became still louder, so that no one could have heard it without terror. The King’s son stayed sitting quite quietly, and was not afraid; but at last the devils jumped up from the ground, and fell on him, and there were so many of them that he could not defend himself from them. They dragged him about on the floor, pinched him, pricked him, beat him, and tormented him, but no sound escaped from him. Towards morning they disappeared, and he was so exhausted that he could scarcely move his limbs, but when day dawned the black maiden came to him. She bore in her hand a little bottle wherein was the water of life wherewith she washed him, and he at once felt all pain depart and new strength flow through his veins. She said, “Thou hast held out successfully for one night, but two more lie before thee.” Then she went away again, and as she was going, he observed that her feet had become white. The next night the devils came and began their gambols anew. They fell on the King’s son, and beat him much more severely than the night before, until his body was covered with wounds."
"But as he bore all quietly, they were forced to leave him, and when dawn appeared, the maiden came and healed him with the water of life."
"And when she went away, he saw with joy that she had already become white to the tips of her fingers. And now he had only one night more to go through, but it was the worst. The hob-goblins came again: “Art thou there still?” cried they, “thou shalt be tormented till thy breath stops.” They pricked him and beat him, and threw him here and there, and pulled him by the arms and legs as if they wanted to tear him to pieces, but he bore everything, and never uttered a cry. At last the devils vanished, but he lay fainting there, and did not stir, nor could he raise his eyes to look at the maiden who came in, and sprinkled and bathed him with the water of life. But suddenly he was freed from all pain, and felt fresh and healthy as if he had awakened from sleep, and when he opened his eyes he saw the maiden standing by him, snow-white, and fair as day. “Rise,” said she, “and swing thy sword three times over the stairs, and then all will be delivered.” And when he had done that, the whole castle was released from enchantment, and the maiden was a rich King’s daughter. The servants came and said that the table was already set in the great hall, and dinner served up. Then they sat down and ate and drank together, and in the evening the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicings."
122 Donkey Cabbages
"There was once a young huntsman who went into the forest to lie in wait. He had a fresh and joyous heart, and as he was going thither, whistling upon a leaf, an ugly old crone came up, who spoke to him and said, “Good-day, dear huntsman, truly you are merry and contented, but I am suffering from hunger and thirst, do give me an alms.” The huntsman had compassion on the poor old creature, felt in his pocket, and gave her what he could afford. He was then about to go further, but the old woman stopped him and said, “Listen, dear huntsman, to what I tell you; I will make you a present in return for your kindness. Go on your way now, but in a little while you will come to a tree, whereon nine birds are sitting which have a cloak in their claws, and are plucking at it; take your gun and shoot into the midst of them, they will let the cloak fall down to you, but one of the birds will be hurt, and will drop down dead. Carry away the cloak, it is a wishing-cloak; when you throw it over your shoulders, you only have to wish to be in a certain place, and you will be there in the twinkling of an eye. Take out the heart of the dead bird and swallow it whole, and every morning early, when you get up, you will find a gold piece under your pillow.”"
"The huntsman thanked the wise woman, and thought to himself, “Those are fine things that she has promised me, if all does but come true.” And verily when he had walked about a hundred paces, he heard in the branches above him such a screaming and twittering that he looked up and saw there a crowd of birds who were tearing a piece of cloth about with their beaks and claws, and tugging and fighting as if each wanted to have it all to himself. “Well,” said the huntsman, “this is wonderful, it has really come to pass just as the old wife foretold!”"
"and he took the gun from his shoulder, aimed and fired right into the midst of them, so that the feathers flew about. The birds instantly took to flight with loud outcries, but one dropped down dead, and the cloak fell at the same time. Then the huntsman did as the old woman had directed him, cut open the bird, sought the heart, swallowed it down, and took the cloak home with him."
"Next morning, when he awoke, the promise occurred to him, and he wished to see if it also had been fulfilled. When he lifted up the pillow, the gold piece shone in his eyes, and next day he found another, and so it went on, every time he got up. He gathered together a heap of gold, but at last he thought, “Of what use is all my gold to me if I stay at home? I will go forth and see the world.”"
"He then took leave of his parents, buckled on his huntsman’s pouch and gun, and went out into the world. It came to pass, that one day he travelled through a dense forest, and when he came to the end of it, in the plain before him stood a fine castle. An old woman was standing with a wonderfully beautiful maiden, looking out of one of the windows."
"The old woman, however, was a witch and said to the maiden, “There comes one out of the forest, who has a wonderful treasure in his body, we must filch it from him, my dear daughter, it is more suitable for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart about him, by means of which a gold piece lies every morning under his pillow.” She told her what she was to do to get it, and what part she had to play, and finally threatened her, and said with angry eyes, “And if you do not attend to what I say, it will be the worse for you.” Now when the huntsman came nearer he descried the maiden, and said to himself, “I have travelled about for such a long time, I will take a rest for once, and enter that beautiful castle. I have certainly money enough.” Nevertheless, the real reason was that he had caught sight of the pretty girl."
"He entered the house, and was well received and courteously entertained. Before long he was so much in love with the young witch that he no longer thought of anything else, and only saw things as she saw them, and did what she desired. The old woman then said, “Now we must have the bird’s heart, he will never miss it.” She prepared a drink, and when it was ready, poured it into a cup and gave it to the maiden, who was to present it to the huntsman. She did so, saying, “Now, my dearest, drink to me.” So he took the cup, and when he had swallowed the draught, he brought up the heart of the bird. The girl had to take it away secretly and swallow it herself, for the old woman would have it so. Thenceforward he found no more gold under his pillow, but it lay instead under that of the maiden, from whence the old woman fetched it away every morning; but he was so much in love and so befooled, that he thought of nothing else but of passing his time with the girl."
"Then the old witch said, “We have the bird’s heart, but we must also take the wishing-cloak away from him.” The girl answered, “We will leave him that, he has lost his wealth.” The old woman was angry and said, “Such a mantle is a wonderful thing, and is seldom to be found in this world. I must and will have it!” She gave the girl several blows, and said that if she did not obey, it should fare ill with her. So she did the old woman’s bidding, placed herself at the window and looked on the distant country, as if she were very sorrowful. The huntsman asked, “Why dost thou stand there so sorrowfully?” “Ah, my beloved,” was her answer, “over yonder lies the Garnet Mountain, where the precious stones grow. I long for them so much that when I think of them, I feel quite sad, but who can get them? Only the birds; they fly and can reach them, but a man never.” “Hast thou nothing else to complain of?” said the huntsman. “I will soon remove that burden from thy heart.” With that he drew her under his mantle, wished himself on the Garnet Mountain, and in the twinkling of an eye they were sitting on it together. Precious stones were glistening on every side so that it was a joy to see them, and together they gathered the finest and costliest of them. Now, the old woman had, through her sorceries, contrived that the eyes of the huntsman should become heavy. He said to the maiden, “We will sit down and rest awhile, I am so tired that I can no longer stand on my feet.” Then they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she unfastened the mantle from his shoulders, and wrapped herself in it, picked up the garnets and stones, and wished herself back at home with them."
"But when the huntsman had had his sleep out and awoke, and perceived that his sweetheart had betrayed him, and left him alone on the wild mountain, he said, “Oh, what treachery there is in the world!” and sat down there in care and sorrow, not knowing what to do. But the mountain belonged to some wild and monstrous giants who dwelt thereon and lived their lives there, and he had not sat long before he saw three of them coming towards him, so he lay down as if he were sunk in a deep sleep."
"Then the giants came up, and the first kicked him with his foot and said, “What sort of an earth-worm is lying curled up here?” The second said, “Step upon him and kill him.” But the third said, “That would indeed be worth your while; just let him live, he cannot remain here; and when he climbs higher, toward the summit of of the mountain, the clouds will lay hold of him and bear him away.” So saying they passed by. But the huntsman had paid heed to their words, and as soon as they were gone, he rose and climbed up to the summit of the mountain, and when he had sat there a while, a cloud floated towards him, caught him up, carried him away, and travelled about for a long time in the heavens. Then it sank lower, and let itself down on a great cabbage-garden, girt round by walls, so that he came softly to the ground on cabbages and vegetables."
"Then the huntsman looked about him and said, “If I had but something to eat! I am so hungry, and my hunger will increase in course of time; but I see here neither apples nor pears, nor any other sort of fruit, everywhere nothing but cabbages,” but at length he thought, “At a pinch I can eat some of the leaves, they do not taste particularly good, but they will refresh me.” With that he picked himself out a fine head of cabbage, and ate it, but scarcely had he swallowed a couple of mouthfuls than he felt very strange and quite different."
"Four legs grew on him, a large head and two thick ears, and he saw with horror that he was changed into an ass. Still as his hunger increased every minute, and as the juicy leaves were suitable to his present nature, he went on eating with great zest. At last he arrived at a different kind of cabbage, but as soon as he had swallowed it, he again felt a change, and reassumed his former human shape."
"Then the huntsman lay down and slept off his fatigue. When he awoke next morning, he broke off one head of the bad cabbages and another of the good ones, and thought to himself, “This shall help me to get my own again and punish treachery.” Then he took the cabbages with him, climbed over the wall, and went forth to seek for the castle of his sweetheart. After wandering about for a couple of days he was lucky enough to find it again. He dyed his face brown, so that his own mother would not have known him; and begged for shelter: “I am so tired,” said he, “that I can go no further.” The witch asked, “Who are you, countryman, and what is your business?” “I am a King’s messenger, and was sent out to seek the most delicious salad which grows beneath the sun. I have even been so fortunate as to find it, and am carrying it about with me; but the heat of the sun is so intense that the delicate cabbage threatens to wither, and I do not know if I can carry it any further.”"
"When the old woman heard of the exquisite salad, she was greedy, and said, “Dear countryman, let me just taste this wonderful salad.” “Why not?” answered he, “I have brought two heads with me, and will give you one of them,” and he opened his pouch and handed her the bad cabbage."
"The witch suspected nothing amiss, and her mouth watered so for this new dish that she herself went into the kitchen and dressed it. When it was prepared she could not wait until it was set on the table, but took a couple of leaves at once, and put them in her mouth, but hardly had she swallowed them than she was deprived of her human shape, and she ran out into the courtyard in the form of an ass. Presently the maid-servant entered the kitchen, saw the salad standing there ready prepared, and was about to carry it up; but on the way, according to habit, she was seized by the desire to taste, and she ate a couple of leaves. Instantly the magic power showed itself, and she likewise became an ass and ran out to the old woman, and the dish of salad fell to the ground. Meantime the messenger sat beside the beautiful girl, and as no one came with the salad and she also was longing for it, she said, “I don’t know what has become of the salad.” The huntsman thought, “The salad must have already taken effect,” and said, “I will go to the kitchen and inquire about it.” As he went down he saw the two asses running about in the courtyard; the salad, however, was lying on the ground. “All right,” said he, “the two have taken their portion,”"
"and he picked up the other leaves, laid them on the dish, and carried them to the maiden. “I bring you the delicate food myself,” said he, “in order that you may not have to wait longer.” Then she ate of it, and was, like the others, immediately deprived of her human form, and ran out into the courtyard in the shape of an ass."
"After the huntsman had washed his face, so that the transformed ones could recognize him, he went down into the courtyard, and said, “Now you shall receive the wages of your treachery,” and bound them together, all three with one rope, and drove them along until he came to a mill. He knocked at the window, the miller put out his head, and asked what he wanted. “I have three unmanageable beasts,” answered he, “which I don’t want to keep any longer. Will you take them in, and give them food and stable room, and manage them as I tell you, and then I will pay you what you ask.” The miller said, “Why not? But how am I to manage them?” The huntsman then said that he was to give three beatings and one meal daily to the old donkey, and that was the witch; one beating and three meals to the younger one, which was the servant-girl; and to the youngest, which was the maiden, no beatings and three meals, for he could not bring himself to have the maiden beaten. After that he went back into the castle, and found therein everything he needed."
"After a couple of days, the miller came and said he must inform him that the old ass which had received three beatings and only one meal daily was dead; “the two others,” he continued, “are certainly not dead, and are fed three times daily, but they are so sad that they cannot last much longer.” The huntsman was moved to pity, put away his anger, and told the miller to drive them back again to him. And when they came, he gave them some of the good salad, so that they became human again. The beautiful girl fell on her knees before him, and said, “Ah, my beloved, forgive me for the evil I have done you; my mother drove me to it; it was done against my will, for I love you dearly."
"Your wishing-cloak hangs in a cupboard, and as for the bird’s-heart I will take a vomiting potion.” But he thought otherwise, and said, “Keep it; it is all the same, for I will take thee for my true wife.” So the wedding was celebrated, and they lived happily together until their death."
123 The Old Woman in the Wood
"A poor servant-girl was once travelling with the family with which she was in service, through a great forest, and when they were in the midst of it, robbers came out of the thicket, and murdered all they found."
"All perished together except the girl, who had jumped out of the carriage in a fright, and hidden herself behind a tree. When the robbers had gone away with their booty, she came out and beheld the great disaster. Then she began to weep bitterly, and said, “What can a poor girl like me do now? I do not know how to get out of the forest, no human being lives in it, so I must certainly starve.” She walked about and looked for a road, but could find none. When it was evening she seated herself under a tree, gave herself into God’s keeping, and resolved to sit waiting there and not go away, let what might happen."
"When, however, she had sat there for a while, a white dove came flying to her with a little golden key in its mouth. It put the little key in her hand, and said, “Dost thou see that great tree, therein is a little lock, it opens with the tiny key, and there thou wilt find food enough, and suffer no more hunger.” Then she went to the tree and opened it, and found milk in a little dish, and white bread to break into it, so that she could eat her fill. When she was satisfied, she said, “It is now the time when the hens at home go to roost, I am so tired I could go to bed too.” Then the dove flew to her again, and brought another golden key in its bill, and said, “Open that tree there, and thou willt find a bed.” So she opened it, and found a beautiful white bed, and she prayed God to protect her during the night, and lay down and slept. In the morning the dove came for the third time, and again brought a little key, and said, “Open that tree there, and thou wilt find clothes.” And when she opened it, she found garments beset with gold and with jewels, more splendid than those of any king’s daughter. So she lived there for some time, and the dove came every day and provided her with all she needed, and it was a quiet good life."
"Once, however, the dove came and said, “Wilt thou do something for my sake?” “With all my heart,” said the girl. Then said the little dove, “I will guide thee to a small house; enter it, and inside it, an old woman will be sitting by the fire and will say, ‘Good-day.’ But on thy life give her no answer, let her do what she will, but pass by her on the right side; further on, there is a door, which open, and thou wilt enter into a room where a quantity of rings of all kinds are lying, amongst which are some magnificent ones with shining stones; leave them, however, where they are, and seek out a plain one, which must likewise be amongst them, and bring it here to me as quickly as thou canst.” The girl went to the little house, and came to the door. There sat an old woman who stared when she saw her, and said, “Good-day my child.” The girl gave her no answer, and opened the door. “Whither away,” cried the old woman, and seized her by the gown, and wanted to hold her fast, saying, “That is my house; no one can go in there if I choose not to allow it.” But the girl was silent, got away from her, and went straight into the room. Now there lay on the table an enormous quantity of rings, which gleamed and glittered before her eyes. She turned them over and looked for the plain one, but could not find it."
91 The Gnome
"There was once upon a time a rich King who had three daughters, who daily went to walk in the palace garden, and the King was a great lover of all kinds of fine trees, but there was one for which he had such an affection, that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished him a hundred fathoms underground. And when harvest time came, the apples on this tree were all as red as blood. The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground. Then the King’s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, “Our father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers.” And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, “Just taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful.” Then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple, whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could hear no cock crow."
"When mid-day came, the King wished to call them to come to dinner, but they were nowhere to be found. He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them. Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife. Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face. Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard. They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King’s daughters. They cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home. At mid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread, then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but whilst he was giving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the huntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again. The huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating. Next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. When the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, “Well, how have you got on?”"
"“Oh, very badly,” said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest. On the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread. When the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again. Then said Hans to the little mannikin, “What! canst thou not pick up that piece thyself? If thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread, thou dost not deserve to have it.” Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating. Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, “Stop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King’s daughters are.” When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King’s daughters were. Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it. And the elf said that he knew well that the companions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honourably with him, therefore if he wished to deliver the King’s children, he must do it alone. The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King’s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger. Hans was therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell, and be let down. Below were three rooms, and in each of them was a princess, with a many-headed dragon, whose heads she was to comb and trim, but he must cut them off. And having said all this, the elf vanished. When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, “pretty well so far,” and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King’s daughters were. Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow. Next morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the eldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him. Then he said, “If I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.” When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again. Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom. When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly. He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon’s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them. Then he took his hanger and hewed at them, and the nine fell off. The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck."
"Then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise. And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him. So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage."
"In the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days there, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute; then said he, “Why dost thou hang there, no one can be merry here?” He looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, “You too cannot help me now.” He walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth. But at last other thoughts came to his mind, and he took the flute from the wall, and played a few notes on it, and suddenly a number of elves appeared, and with every note that he sounded one more came. Then he played until the room was entirely filled. They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. When he was above ground, he at once went to the King’s palace, just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he went to the room where the King and his three daughters were. When the princesses saw him they fainted. Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children. When the princesses came to themselves, however, they entreated the King to set him free again. The King asked why, and they said that they were not allowed to tell that, but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove. And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything. Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, “Klink,” and were broken."
92 The King of the Golden Mountain
"There was a certain merchant who had two children, a boy and a girl; they were both young, and could not walk. And two richly-laden ships of his sailed forth to sea with all his property on board, and just as he was expecting to win much money by them, news came that they had gone to the bottom, and now instead of being a rich man he was a poor one, and had nothing left but one field outside the town. In order to drive his misfortune a little out of his thoughts, he went out to this field, and as he was walking forwards and backwards in it, a little black mannikin stood suddenly by his side, and asked why he was so sad, and what he was taking so much to heart. Then said the merchant, “If thou couldst help me I would willingly tell thee.” “Who knows?” replied the black dwarf. “Perhaps, I can help thee.” Then the merchant told him that all he possessed had gone to the bottom of the sea, and that he had nothing left but this field. “Do not trouble thyself,” said the dwarf. “If thou wilt promise to give me the first thing that rubs itself against thy leg when thou art at home again, and to bring it here to this place in twelve years’ time, thou shalt have as much money as thou wilt.” The merchant thought, “What can that be but my dog?” and did not remember his little boy, so he said yes, gave the black man a written and sealed promise, and went home."
"When he reached home, his little boy was so delighted that he held by a bench, tottered up to him and seized him fast by the legs. The father was shocked, for he remembered his promise, and now knew what he had pledged himself to do; as however, he still found no money in his chest, he thought the dwarf had only been jesting. A month afterwards he went up to the garret, intending to gather together some old tin and to sell it, and saw a great heap of money lying. Then he was happy again, made purchases, became a greater merchant than before, and felt that this world was well-governed. In the meantime the boy grew tall, and at the same time sharp and clever. But the nearer the twelfth year approached the more anxious grew the merchant, so that his distress might be seen in his face. One day his son asked what ailed him, but the father would not say. The boy, however, persisted so long, that at last he told him that without being aware of what he was doing, he had promised him to a black dwarf, and had received much money for doing so. He said likewise that he had set his hand and seal to this, and that now when twelve years had gone by he would have to give him up."
"Then said the son, “Oh, father, do not be uneasy, all will go well. The black man has no power over me.” The son had himself blessed by the priest, and when the time came, father and son went together to the field, and the son made a circle and placed himself inside it with his father. Then came the black dwarf and said to the old man, “Hast thou brought with thee that which thou hast promised me?” He was silent, but the son asked, “What dost thou want here?” Then said the black dwarf, “I have to speak with thy father, and not with thee.” The son replied, “Thou hast betrayed and misled my father, give back the writing.” “No,”"
"said the black dwarf, “I will not give up my rights.” They spoke together for a long time after this, but at last they agreed that the son, as he did not belong to the enemy of mankind, nor yet to his father, should seat himself in a small boat, which should lie on water which was flowing away from them, and that the father should push it off with his own foot, and then the son should remain given up to the water. So he took leave of his father, placed himself in a little boat, and the father had to push it off with his own foot. The boat capsized so that the keel was uppermost, and the father believed his son was lost, and went home and mourned for him."
"The boat, however, did not sink, but floated quietly away, and the boy sat safely inside it, and it floated thus for a long time, until at last it stopped by an unknown shore. Then he landed and saw a beautiful castle before him, and set out to go to it. But when he entered it, he found that it was bewitched. He went through every room, but all were empty until he reached the last, where a snake lay coiled in a ring."
"The snake, however, was an enchanted maiden, who rejoiced to see him, and said, “Hast thou come, oh, my deliverer? I have already waited twelve years for thee; this kingdom is bewitched, and thou must set it free.” “How can I do that?” he inquired. “To-night come twelve black men, covered with chains who will ask what thou art doing here; keep silent; give them no answer, and let them do what they will with thee; they will torment thee, beat thee, stab thee; let everything pass, only do not speak; at twelve o’clock, they must go away again. On the second night twelve others will come; on the third, four-and-twenty, who will cut off thy head, but at twelve o’clock their power will be over, and then if thou hast endured all, and hast not spoken the slightest word, I shall be released. I will come to thee, and will have, in a bottle, some of the water of life. I will rub thee with that, and then thou wilt come to life again, and be as healthy as before.” Then said he, “I will gladly set thee free.” And everything happened just as she had said; the black men could not force a single word from him, and on the third night the snake became a beautiful princess, who came with the water of life and brought him back to life again. So she threw herself into his arms and kissed him, and there was joy and gladness in the whole castle. After this their marriage was celebrated, and he was King of the Golden Mountain."
"They lived very happily together, and the Queen bore a fine boy. Eight years had already gone by, when the King bethought him of his father; his heart was moved, and he wished to visit him. The Queen, however, would not let him go away, and said, “I know beforehand that it will cause my unhappiness;” but he suffered her to have no rest until she consented. At their parting she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, “Take this ring and put it on thy finger, and then thou wilt immediately be transported whithersoever thou wouldst be, only thou must promise me not to use it in wishing me away from this place and with thy father.” That he promised her, put the ring on his finger, and wished himself at home, just outside the town where his father lived."
"Instantly he found himself there, and made for the town, but when he came to the gate, the sentries would not let him in, because he wore such strange and yet such rich and magnificent clothing. Then he went to a hill where a shepherd was watching his sheep, changed clothes with him, put on his old shepherd’s-coat, and then entered the town without hindrance. When he came to his father, he made himself known to him, but he did not at all believe that the shepherd was his son, and said he certainly had had a son, but that he was dead long ago; however, as he saw he was a poor, needy shepherd, he would give him something to eat. Then the shepherd said to his parents, “I am verily your son. Do you know of no mark on my body by which you could recognize me?” “Yes,”"
"said his mother, “our son had a raspberry mark under his right arm.” He slipped back his shirt, and they saw the raspberry under his right arm, and no longer doubted that he was their son. Then he told them that he was King of the Golden Mountain, and a king’s daughter was his wife, and that they had a fine son of seven years old. Then said the father, “That is certainly not true; it is a fine kind of a king who goes about in a ragged shepherd’s-coat.” On this the son fell in a passion, and without thinking of his promise, turned his ring round, and wished both his wife and child with him. They were there in a second, but the Queen wept, and reproached him, and said that he had broken his word, and had brought misfortune upon her. He said, “I have done it thoughtlessly, and not with evil intention,” and tried to calm her, and she pretended to believe this; but she had mischief in her mind."
"Then he led her out of the town into the field, and showed her the stream where the little boat had been pushed off, and then he said, “I am tired; sit down, I will sleep awhile on thy lap.” And he laid his head on her lap, and fell asleep. When he was asleep, she first drew the ring from his finger, then she drew away the foot which was under him, leaving only the slipper behind her, and she took her child in her arms, and wished herself back in her own kingdom. When he awoke, there he lay quite deserted, and his wife and child were gone, and so was the ring from his finger, the slipper only was still there as a token."
"“Home to thy parents thou canst not return,” thought he, “they would say that thou wast a wizard; thou must be off, and walk on until thou arrivest in thine own kingdom.” So he went away and came at length to a hill by which three giants were standing, disputing with each other because they did not know how to divide their father’s property. When they saw him passing by, they called to him and said little men had quick wits, and that he was to divide their inheritance for them. The inheritance, however, consisted of a sword, which had this property that if any one took it in his hand, and said, “All heads off but mine,” every head would lie on the ground; secondly, of a cloak which made any one who put it on invisible; thirdly, of a pair of boots which could transport the wearer to any place he wished in a moment. He said, “Give me the three things that I may see if they are still in good condition.” They gave him the cloak, and when he had put it on, he was invisible and changed into a fly. Then he resumed his own form and said, “The cloak is a good one, now give me the sword.” They said, “No, we will not give thee that; if thou were to say, All heads off but mine,’ all our heads would be off, and thou alone wouldst be left with thine.” Nevertheless they gave it to him with the condition that he was only to try it against a tree. This he did, and the sword cut in two the trunk of a tree as if it had been a blade of straw. Then he wanted to have the boots likewise, but they said, “No, we will not give them; if thou hadst them on thy feet and wert to wish thyself at the top of the hill, we should be left down here with nothing.” “Oh, no,” said he, “I will not do that.” So they gave him the boots as well. And now when he had got all these things, he thought of nothing but his wife and his child, and said as though to himself, “Oh, if I were but on the Golden Mountain,” and at the same moment he vanished from the sight of the giants, and thus their inheritance was divided. When he was near his palace, he heard sounds of joy, and fiddles, and flutes, and the people told him that his wife was celebrating her wedding with another. Then he fell into a rage, and said, “False woman, she betrayed and deserted me whilst I was asleep!” So he put on his cloak, and unseen by all went into the palace. When he entered the dining-hall a great table was spread with delicious food, and the guests were eating and drinking, and laughing, and jesting. She sat on a royal seat in the midst of them in splendid apparel, with a crown on her head. He placed himself behind her, and no one saw him. When she put a piece of meat on a plate for herself, he took it away and ate it, and when she poured out a glass of wine for herself, he took it away and drank it. She was always helping herself to something, and yet she never got anything, for plate and glass disappeared immediately. Then dismayed and ashamed, she arose and went to her chamber and wept, but he followed her there. She said, “Has the devil power over me, or did my deliverer never come?” Then he struck her in the face, and said, “Did thy deliverer never come? It is he who has thee in his power, thou traitor. Have I deserved this from thee?” Then he made himself visible, went into the hall, and cried, “The wedding is at an end, the true King has returned.” The kings, princes, and councillors who were assembled there, ridiculed and mocked him, but he did not trouble to answer them, and said, “Will you go away, or not?” On this they tried to seize him and pressed upon him, but he drew his sword and said, “All heads off but mine,” and all the heads rolled on the ground, and he alone was master, and once more King of the Golden Mountain."
93 The Raven
"There was once upon a time a Queen who had a little daughter who was still so young that she had to be carried. One day the child was naughty, and the mother might say what she liked, but the child would not be quiet. Then she became impatient, and as the ravens were flying about the palace, she opened the window and said, “I wish you were a raven and would fly away, and then I should have some rest.” Scarcely had she spoken the words, before the child was changed into a raven, and flew from her arms out of the window. It flew into a dark forest, and stayed in it a long time, and the parents heard nothing of their child. Then one day a man was on his way through this forest and heard the raven crying, and followed the voice, and when he came nearer, the bird said, “I am a king’s daughter by birth, and am bewitched, but thou canst set me free.” “What am I to do,” asked he. She said, “Go further into the forest, and thou wilt find a house, wherein sits an aged woman, who will offer thee meat and drink, but you must accept nothing, for if you eatest and drinkest anything, thou wilt fall into a sleep, and then thou wilt not be able to deliver me. In the garden behind the house there is a great heap of tan, and on this thou shalt stand and wait for me. For three days I will come every afternoon at two o’clock in a carriage. On the first day four white horses will be harnessed to it, then four chestnut horses, and lastly four black ones; but if thou art not awake, but sleeping, I shall not be set free.” The man promised to do everything that she desired, but the raven said, alas, “I know already that thou wilt not deliver me; thou wilt accept something from the woman.” Then the man once more promised that he would certainly not touch anything either to eat or to drink. But when he entered the house the old woman came to him and said, “Poor man, how faint you are; come and refresh yourself; eat and drink.” “No,” said the man, “I will not eat or drink.” She, however, let him have no peace, and said, “If you will not eat, take one drink out of the glass; one is nothing.” Then he let himself be persuaded, and drank. Shortly before two o’clock in the afternoon he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven. As he was standing there, his weariness all at once became so great that he could not struggle against it, and lay down for a short time, but he was determined not to go to sleep. Hardly, however, had he lain down, than his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell asleep and slept so soundly that nothing in the world could have aroused him."
"At two o’clock the raven came driving up with four white horses, but she was already in deep grief and said, “I know he is asleep.” And when she came into the garden, he was indeed lying there asleep on the heap of tan. She alighted from the carriage, went to him, shook him, and called him, but he did not awake. Next day about noon, the old woman came again and brought him food and drink, but he would not take any of it. But she let him have no rest and persuaded him until at length he again took one drink out of the glass. Towards two o’clock he went into the garden to the tan heap to wait for the raven, but all at once felt such a great weariness that his limbs would no longer support him. He could not help himself, and was forced to lie down, and fell into a heavy sleep. When the raven drove up with four brown horses, she was already full of grief, and said, “I know he is asleep.” She went to him, but there he lay sleeping, and there was no wakening him. Next day the old woman asked what was the meaning of this? He was neither eating nor drinking anything; did he want to die? He replied, “I am not allowed to eat or drink, and will not do so.” But she set a dish with food, and a glass with wine before him, and when he smelt it he could not resist, and swallowed a deep draught. When the time came, he went out into the garden to the heap of tan, and waited for the King’s daughter; but he became still more weary than on the day before, and lay down and slept as soundly as if he had been a stone. At two o’clock the raven came with four black horses, and the coachman and everything else was black. She was already in the deepest grief, and said, “I know that he is asleep and cannot deliver me.” When she came to him, there he was lying fast asleep. She shook him and called him, but she could not waken him. Then she laid a loaf beside him, and after that a piece of meat, and thirdly a bottle of wine, and he might consume as much of all of them as he liked, but they would never grow less. After this she took a gold ring from her finger, and put it on his, and her name was graven on it. Lastly, she laid a letter beside him wherein was written what she had given him, and that none of the things would ever grow less; and in it was also written, “I see right well that here you will never be able to deliver me, but if thou art still willing to deliver me, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; it lies in thy power, of that I am certain.” And when she had given him all these things, she seated herself in her carriage, and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg."
"When the man awoke and saw that he had slept, he was sad at heart, and said, “She has certainly driven by, and I have not set her free.” Then he perceived the things which were lying beside him, and read the letter wherein was written how everything had happened. So he arose and went away, intending to go to the golden castle of Stromberg, but he did not know where it was. After he had walked about the world for a long time, he entered into a dark forest, and walked for fourteen days, and still could not find his way out. Then it was once more evening, and he was so tired that he lay down in a thicket and fell asleep. Next day he went onwards, and in the evening, as he was again about to lie down beneath some bushes, he heard such a howling and crying that he could not go to sleep. And at the time when people light the candles, he saw one glimmering, and arose and went towards it. Then he came to a house which seemed very small, for in front of it a great giant was standing. He thought to himself, “If I go in, and the giant sees me, it will very likely cost me my life.”"
"At length he ventured it and went in. When the giant saw him, he said, “It is well that thou comest, for it is long since I have eaten; I will at once eat thee for my supper.” “I’d rather you would leave that alone,” said the man, “I do not like to be eaten; but if thou hast any desire to eat, I have quite enough here to satisfy thee.” “If that be true,” said the giant, “thou mayst be easy, I was only going to devour thee because I had nothing else.” Then they went, and sat down to the table, and the man took out the bread, wine, and meat which would never come to an end. “This pleases me well,” said the giant, and ate to his heart’s content. Then the man said to him, “Canst thou tell me where the golden castle of Stromberg is?” The giant said, “I will look at my map; all the towns, and villages, and houses are to be found on it.” He brought out the map which he had in the room and looked for the castle, but it was not to be found on it. “It’s no matter!” said he, “I have some still larger maps in my cupboard upstairs, and we will look in them.” But there, too, it was in vain. The man now wanted to go onwards, but the giant begged him to wait a few days longer until his brother, who had gone out to bring some provisions, came home. When the brother came home they inquired about the golden castle of Stromberg."
"He replied, “When I have eaten and have had enough, I will look in the map.” Then he went with them up to his chamber, and they searched in his map, but could not find it. Then he brought out still older maps, and they never rested until they found the golden castle of Stromberg, but it was many thousand miles away. “How am I to get there?” asked the man. The giant said, “I have two hours’ time, during which I will carry you into the neighbourhood, but after that I must be at home to suckle the child that we have.” So the giant carried the man to about a hundred leagues from the castle, and said, “Thou canst very well walk the rest of the way alone.” And he turned back, but the man went onwards day and night, until at length he came to the golden castle of Stromberg. It stood on a glass-mountain, and the bewitched maiden drove in her carriage round the castle, and then went inside it. He rejoiced when he saw her and wanted to climb up to her, but when he began to do so he always slipped down the glass again. And when he saw that he could not reach her, he was filled with trouble, and said to himself, “I will stay down here below, and wait for her.” So he built himself a hut and stayed in it for a whole year, and every day saw the King’s daughter driving about above, but never could go to her. Then one day he saw from his hut three robbers who were beating each other, and cried to them, “God be with ye!” They stopped when they heard the cry, but as they saw no one, they once more began to beat each other, and that too most dangerously. So he again cried, “God be with ye!” Again they stopped, looked round about, but as they saw no one they went on beating each other. Then he cried for the third time, “God be with ye,”"
"and thought, “I must see what these three are about,” and went thither and asked why they were beating each other so furiously. One of them said that he found a stick, and that when he struck a door with it, that door would spring open. The next said that he had found a mantle, and that whenever he put it on, he was invisible, but the third said he had found a horse on which a man could ride everywhere, even up the glass-mountain. And now they did not know whether they ought to have these things in common, or whether they ought to divide them. Then the man said, “I will give you something in exchange for these three things. Money indeed have I not, but I have other things of more value; but first I must try yours to see if you have told the truth.” Then they put him on the horse, threw the mantle round him, and gave him the stick in his hand, and when he had all these things they were no longer able to see him. So he gave them some vigorous blows and cried, “Now, vagabonds, you have got what you deserve, are you satisfied?” And he rode up the glass-mountain, but when he came in front of the castle at the top, it was shut. Then he struck the door with his stick, and it sprang open immediately. He went in and ascended the stairs until he came to the hall where the maiden was sitting with a golden cup full of wine before her. She,"

Gomme nodded:

Gomme smiled:
“No--but he can model ’em.”

Perhaps that is why it had to wait fifteen years for a successor. Quite
possibly its spectators regarded it as merely a better Interlude than

Inserts[42] are almost always printed upon coated paper.
"Laid[42] paper is used in more expensive books, as, from its nature,"
better and more costly stock is required in its making.
THE PRESSWORK
"Books are printed in forms[42] of 4 pages and multiples of 4 pages,"
"depending upon the size of the paper leaf. The usual form is 32 pages,"
so the publisher tries to plan his volume to make approximately even
forms. To print any number of pages over an even form is as expensive
as to print the complete 32 pages.[43]
THE BINDING
"In binding, the questions to be settled include the style of"
"back,--flat, half-round, or round; plain or gilt-top; headband[45]"
"or not; trimmed or uncut edges;[44] kind of cloth,--T pattern,[45]"
"silk,[45] vellum,[45] etc.; color and shade of cloth; location of dies;"
"stamping,--ink, foil, gold or Oriental tissue, etc.; jacket,--glassine,"
"manila, or printed."
THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BOOK
"THE proper layout for an ordinary volume, arranged in accord with the"
"best usage, is as follows:"
"College libraries go under the name of the college: e.g., _Harvard"
"College, University Library_. But the Bodleian Library may be put"
under _Bodleian_.
Local college societies go under the name of the college;
intercollegiate societies and Greek letter fraternities under
"their own names: e.g., Φ B K _A, of Harvard_."
Alumni and Alumnæ associations go under the name of the school or
"college: e.g., _Harvard Alumni Association of New York_."
Schools supported by public taxation go under the name of the city
"or town maintaining them, whether they have an individual name or"
not.
When a corporation is much less known by the first words of its
"name than by a later part, enter under the later part: e.g.,"
"_Christian Endeavor, Young People's Society of_."
"Enter guilds under the name of the trade: e.g., _Stationers"
"Company_, not _Master and Keepers or Wardens and Commonality of"
"the Mystery and Art of Stationers of the City of London_, which"
is the corporate title.
"Enter bodies whose legal name begins with such words as _Board_,"
"_Corporation_, _Trustees_ under that part of the name by"
"which they are usually known: e.g., Trustees of the _Eastern"
Dispensary_; President and Fellows of _Harvard College_;
Proprietors of the _Boston Athenæum_; Contributors to the
_Asylum for the Relief of Persons Deprived of their Reason_.
Cross-reference from the first word of the legal name.
and those of the German patriotic historians the Hansa is seen in a
rather delusive abstract. The useful monograph of Miss Zimmern (_The
Hansa Towns_: Story of the Nations Series) gives a good idea of the
"reality. See in particular pp. 82-147. It should be noted, however, that"
Lübeck is credited with being the first northern town to adopt the
"Oriental usage of water-pipes (Macpherson, _Annals of Commerce_, 1802,"
"i, 381).]"
Chapter IV
HOLLAND
NOTE ON LITERATURE
The special interest of Dutch history for English and other readers led
in past generations to a more general sociological study of it than was
given to almost any other. L. Guicciardini's _Description of the Low
"Countries_ (_Descrizione ... di tutti Paesi Bassi_, etc., Anversa,"
"folio, 1567, 1581, etc.; trans. in French, 1568, etc.; in English, 1593;"
"in Dutch, 1582; in Latin, 1613, etc.) is one of the fullest surveys of"
the kind made till recent times. Sir William Temple's _Observations upon
the United Provinces of the Netherlands_ (1672) laid for English readers
further foundations of an intelligent knowledge of the vital conditions
of the State which had been in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
the great commercial rival of England; and in the eighteenth century
many English writers discussed the fortunes of Dutch commerce. An
English translation was made of the remarkably sagacious work variously
"known as the _Memoirs of John de Witt_, the _True Interest of Holland_,"
_Sale._
[Sidenote: Power to Court to order Sale.]
"26. The Court may at any Time, if it thinks fit, on account of the"
"Condition of the captured Ship, or on the Application of a Claimant,"
order that the captured Ship be appraised as aforesaid (if not already
"appraised), and be sold."
[Sidenote: Sale on Condemnation.]
"27. On or after Condemnation the Court may, if it thinks fit, order that"
"the Ship be appraised as aforesaid (if not already appraised), and be"
sold.
[Sidenote: How Sales to be made.]
28. Every Sale shall be made by or under the Superintendence of the
Marshal of the Court or of the Officer having the Custody of the
captured Ship.
[Sidenote: Payment of Proceeds to Paymaster General or Official
Accountant.]
"29. The Proceeds of any Sale, made either before or after Condemnation,"
"and after Condemnation the appraised Value of the captured Ship, in case"
"she has been delivered up to a Claimant on Bail, shall be paid under an"
Order of the Court either into the Bank of _England_ to the Credit of
"Her Majesty's Paymaster General, or into the Hands of an Official"
Accountant (belonging to the Commissariat or some other Department)
appointed for this Purpose by the Commissioners of Her Majesty's
"Treasury or by the Lords of the Admiralty, subject in either case to"
"reversed, and then ended. This was the last answer of the plants."
Thus the responsiveness of the plant world was one. There was no
"difference of any kind between sunshine plants, and those which had"
hitherto been regarded as insensitive or ordinary. It had also been
shown that all the varied and complex responses of the animal were
foreshadowed in the plant. An impressive spectacle was thus revealed of
"that vast unity in which all living organisms, from the simplest plant"
"to the highest animal, were linked together and made one."

EVIDENCE BEFORE THE PUBLIC SERVICES COMMISSION
"The following is the evidence given by Dr. J. C. Bose, C. S. I., C. I."
"E., Professor of Physics, Presidency College, Calcutta, on the 18th"
"December, 1913, before the Royal Commission on the Public Services in"
"India, presided over by Lord Islington, and published, in the Minutes of"
"Evidence relating to the Education Department, at pages 135 to 137, in"
"volume XX, Appendix to the Report of the Commissioners:"
WRITTEN STATEMENT RELATING TO THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT
"83, 627 (I) _Method of recruitment._--The first question on which I have"
been asked to give my opinion is as regards the method of recruitment. I
think that a high standard of scholarship should be the only
"qualification insisted on. Graduates of well-known Universities,"
"Aubrey at the mantelpiece, gazing at himself in the mirror, said simply:"
“Bosh!”
"“Rather a dramatic situation when you come to think of it, eh?” said"
"Fluffy Reubens, lolling his full length in the easy-chair."
"Rippley, his hands in his trousers pockets, considered the situation"
with reflective eye fixed on the carpet:
"“And a rippin’ dramatic emotion, eh! To feel one’s self being wrangled"
about from one end of the country to the other----”
Aubrey turned languidly from the mirror:
"“Ah!” said he, “and then to listen to it all, robed in the delightful"
invisible cloak of pseudonymity!”
Rippley laughed drily:
"“No, no, Aubrey, old man--that wouldn’t have suited you at all. You"
wouldn’t have lasted at it for a fortnight.”
Lovegood smiled:
"“We need not get into the quarrelsome stage about it yet,” he said in"
his big deep voice: “We shall be tearing him to pieces in magazine
articles to-morrow and flinging him to the dogs of the lower journalism
to snarl at before the year is out.... The failures are always
suspicious of popularity.”
"Aubrey turned to the mirror again, and said “Bosh!”"
With the greatest diffidence I have at last made up my mind to write
the story of my small campaign with the Sarhad Raiders in 1916.
This campaign sinks into utter insignificance when compared with the
great deeds done in other theatres of war by men who said nothing
"about them. But, insignificant as it was, it forms part of the mosaic"
"of the Great War, and for this reason may be of some general interest."
I take this opportunity of paying a tribute to all the officers who
"took part in this little campaign. Their untiring devotion to duty,"
and their efforts to do their utmost under conditions that were often
"more than trying, accounts for its success."
"I would like, in particular, to mention Major Landon of the 35th"
"Scinde Horse, whose great knowledge of the people and their country"
was invaluable; Major Sanders of the 36th Sikhs; Colonel Claridge of
"the 28th Light Cavalry; Captain Brownlow and Captain Hirst, both of"
the 28th Light Cavalry; Major Lang; Captain Moore-Lane; Lieutenant
"Bream of the Hazara Pioneers, and Captain English, R.A."
"In addition I would mention how much, not only I, but the old country"
"owes to Khan Bahadur, the Sarhad-dar, and to Idu, non-commissioned"
officer of the Chagai Levies.
The photographs are from snapshots taken by various officers during
the campaign.

value--The actuality of Truth--Truth as history: the function of error

"There is one problem in the history of human thought, which, however"
conscious we might be of the multiplicity and historical contingency
"of philosophical problems, yet can appear to us as the ultimate or"
"central one, if only because it is an abstract interrogation describing"
"the attitude of the philosopher, and to which every concrete logical"
"research, every act of thought, can be reduced. It is Pilate's"
question: _Quid est veritas?_ What is truth?
"The question itself has no definite meaning, until it receives from the"
"individual thinker a definite content, which is history or experience,"
and the infinite variety of the answers it has received is due to the
infinite variability of that content. But at all times man has been
basis of all Roman Catholic music today. Some of these chants were
"adapted by Luther for congregational singing, and set to words in the"
"vernacular of the people. A few of the tunes, usually in a form scarcely"
"recognizable from the original, are used today in Protestant hymnals, as"
"for instance, the tune “Hamburg.” Some of the music in the Amish church"
services is traceable to the Gregorian Chant.
The singing in the medieval church was liturgical in character and
confined to the clergy and trained choirs. This was its weakness. The
"laity was not expected to sing, neither were they able to do so."
"Congregational singing, so important in our worship today, had for"
centuries been unknown in the Roman Catholic Church. Reform was
inevitable and it came in due time.
"While only remnants of the music survive, many hymns from the Western"
Church have been translated from the Latin and a few choice ones have
found their way into the _Hymnary_.
Latin Hymns in the Hymnary
"Prudentius, 348-c. 413, “Bethlehem, of noblest cities” (88)"
"Gregory the Great, 540-604, “Father, we praise Thee” (24)"
"Anonymous, 6th or 7th century, “Christ is made the sure” (277)"
“Joy dawned again on Easterday” (415)
"Theodulph of Orleans, 9th century, “All glory, laud, and honor”"
(100)
"Bernard of Clairvaux, 1091-1153, “Jesus the very thought” (155)"
"“O sacred Head, now wounded” (539)"
"Bernard of Cluny, 12th century, “Jerusalem, the golden” (262-3)"
"Anonymous, 12th century, “O come, O come, Emmanuel” (67)"
"Savonarola, 1452-98 (Italian), “Jesus, Refuge of the weary” (536)"
ADJECTIVE-HEADINGS
"In general, a noun or a substantive phrase should be selected for the"
"heading, but when an adjective forms part of a name or well-known"
"term, the entry should include it: e.g., _Alimentary canal, hereditary"
"genius, perpetual motion_, etc."
SUBJECT-MATTER
It is not possible to formulate rules for indexing subject-matter
"as definitely as has already been done with names, places, etc. The"
judgment of the indexer and his analytical skill will be called fully
"into play. The effort should be to express in the index, in the"
"clearest yet briefest form, the _idea_ which the author has amplified"
"in his text. As an aid to the nature and form of the entries, a page of"
"text is shown on the opposite page, and the entries which would appear"
"in the index from this page, are given below. This is what would be"
considered as a medium full index:
"Bressani, Joseph, tortured by Iroquois, 73; life spared by Iroquois,"
"73; sent to Fort Orange, 73; ransomed by Dutch, 73; sent to Rochelle,"
73.
"Dutch, the, ransom Bressani, 73."
"Indian Torture, See _Torture, Indian_."
"Iroquois Indians, the, torture Bressani, 73; spare Bressani's"
"life, 73."

The United Fruit Company is by far the greatest agricultural enterprise
the world has ever known. Its fruit plantations constitute a farm half a
mile wide and more than seven hundred miles long. All of its farm lands
exceed in area the 1332 square miles which constitute the sovereign
"State of Rhode Island. On these farms are more than 25,000 head of live"
stock. This agricultural empire is traversed by nearly 1000 miles of
railroad. To carry the fruits from the plantations to the seaports there
are employed 100 locomotives and 3000 freight cars. An army of nearly
"40,000 men is employed in this new and mammoth industry. The republics"
of Central America were inland nations before the United Fruit Company
made gardens of the low Caribbean coast lands and created from the
"virgin wilderness such ports as Barrios, Cortez, Limon and Bocas del"
Toro.

9. English Hymnody.
"The youthful, courageous Isaac Watts, 1674-1748, an ardent dissenter,"
pioneered the movement which resulted in a flood of hymns and hymnbooks
in the English churches. Watts was not satisfied with the psalm singing
"of his time, which by now had become formal and lifeless. Parts of the"
"psalter, he pointed out, were obviously not written in the spirit of the"
"Gospel. “By keeping too close to David,” he wrote in one of his"
"Prefaces, “the vail of Moses is thrown over our hearts.” Watts removed"
"that “vail,” Christianizing the psalms and composing during his lifetime"
"more than 600 original hymns, expressing in the language of the time,"
"the thoughts of the worshippers. Through his influence, his age, the"
"18th century, became the first age of hymn singing in England."
"John and Charles Wesley, following Watts, made enormous use of hymn"
"singing in their evangelistic work, giving the movement for"
congregational singing a powerful impetus. Charles is said to have
"composed over 6,000 hymns."
"From the Wesleys onward through the 19th century, the hymn writers in"
England became numerous. The restrictive shackles of psalm singing had
been broken and the creative urge to worship in new forms resulted in a
vast number of original religious lyrics and the publication of hundreds
of hymnbooks. The development can be summarized here only in outline
form.
English Hymnody in the Hymnary
Early—17th Century
"Henry Wotton, 1568-1639, “How happy is he” (208)"
"George Herbert, 1593-1633, “Teach me, my God and King” (226)"

HISTORY OF A DISCOVERY
Substance of a Lecture delivered by Prof. J. C. Bose on the 20th
"November 1915, at the Ram Mohan Library, under the Presidency of the"
"Hon'ble Mr. P. C. Lyon, and published at p. 693, Vol. xviii, of the"
"""Modern Review"" (July to December, 1915)."
"At the tournament held before the court at Hastinapur, more than"
"twenty-five centuries ago, Karna, the reputed son of a Charioteer, had"
challenged the supremacy of Prince Arjuna. To this challenge Arjuna had
returned a scornful answer; a prince could not cross swords with one who
"could claim no nobility of descent. ""I am my own ancestor,"" replied"
"Karna, and this perhaps the earliest assertion of the right of man to"
choose and determine his own destiny. In the realm of knowledge also the
great achievements have been won only by men with determined purpose and
without any adventitious aids. Undismayed by human limitations they had
struggled in spite of many a failure. In their inquiry after truth they
"regarded nothing as too laborious, nothing too insignificant, nothing"
too painful. This is the process which all must follow; there is no
easier path.
The lecturer's research on the properties of Electric Waves was begun
just twenty-one years ago. In this he was greatly encouraged by the
"appreciation shown by the Royal Society, which not only published his"
"researches, but also offered a Parliamentary grant for the continuance"
"Richard Roberts, 1874—, “For them whose ways” (166)"
"Laurence Housman, 1865—, “Father Eternal” (354)"
10. American Hymns.
The English speaking colonists who settled in America during the 17th
century continued the psalm singing traditions of their forebears in
England. The practice prevailed in their churches for two hundred years.
"The first book printed by them was the _Bay Psalm Book_, in 1640, at"
"Cambridge, Massachusetts. It contained no original hymns. The singing of"
"psalms, and later of hymns borrowed from England made up nearly the"
entire repertory of church music until the middle of the 19th century.
"On the other hand, the German speaking colonists, including the"
"Mennonites, had brought with them the hymn books of the Lutheran"
tradition and continued the use of the German chorales in their worship.
"The two streams of hymnody, English psalms and German chorales, went"
"their independent courses for two centuries, scarcely influencing each"
other.
In the meantime there was very little original hymnody produced in
"America, with the exception of the work of the Wesleys during their"
"brief experiment in Georgia, and the composition of certain hymns and"
"tunes by the German people of Pennsylvania, which have remained, until"
"recently, in manuscript form. Timothy Dwight’s hymn on the church, “I"
"love Thy Kingdom, Lord” (275) is probably the earliest American hymn"
still in use.
After the middle of the 19th century the number of hymn writers became
"large and their works came into increasing use, some choice examples"
finding their way into English hymnbooks. America’s original

From the windows of our hotel at Pisa we saw for the first time the
red gold of ripe oranges shining amid their dark green leaves in the
"gardens, and rejoiced to think that at last we had reached a somewhat"
"milder climate, and were now leaving rigorous winter behind us."
"The journey from Pisa to Rome is a long one, and the schedule was such"
that we did not arrive till late at night. From the car windows we had
"some impressive views of the Mediterranean by moonlight, and of the"
"solemn campagna, and, thus prepared, we crossed the Tiber at midnight,"
and passed through the breach in the walls which has been made for the

with which all travellers except those who are utterly devoid of
imagination first enter the Eternal City.

CHAPTER XXVIII
THE DEAD AND THE LIVING
"Not a word more was uttered between the two. La Giralda, for no reason"
"that she would acknowledge even to herself, had conceived an infinite"
"respect for Sergeant Cardono, and was ready to obey him implicitly--a"
fact which shows that our sweet Concha was over-hasty in supposing that
one woman in any circumstances can ever answer for another when there is
a man in the case.
But on this occasion La Giralda's submission was productive of no more
"than a command to go down into the town of San Ildefonso, the white"
"houses of which could clearly be seen a mile or two below, while the"
sergeant betook himself to certain haunts of the gipsy and the brigand
known to him in the fastnesses of the Guadarrama.
Like a dog La Giralda complied. She sharpened a stick with a knife which
"she took from a little concealed sheath in her leathern leggings, and"
with it she proceeded to quicken the donkey's extremely deliberate pace.
"Then with the characteristic cry of the goatherd, she gathered her flock"
together and drove them before her down the deeply-rutted road which led
"from the farmhouse. She had not proceeded far, however, when she"
Of Tortuga Island.
"Refused to accept the Royal offer of pardon of 1670, when all commissions"
"to privateer on the Spanish were revoked. Thurston, with a mulatto, Diego,"
"using obsolete commissions issued by the late Governor of Jamaica,"
"Modyford, continued to prey upon Spanish shipping, carrying their prizes"
to Tortuga.
"THWAITES, CAPTAIN JOSEPH."
"Coxswain to Captain Hood, he was promoted in 1763 to be a midshipman in"
"H.M.S. _Zealous_, cruising in the Mediterranean. Putting into Algiers,"
"Thwaites was sent ashore by the captain to buy some sheep, but did not"
"return to the boat and, it being supposed he had been assassinated, the"
"ship sailed without him. The fact was that young Thwaites, who spoke"
"Turkish and Greek, had accepted an invitation to enter the Ottoman"
"service. Embracing the Mohammedan religion, Thwaites was put in command of"
a forty-four gun frigate.
"His first engagement was with the flagship of the Tunisian Admiral, which"
"he took and carried to Algiers. He soon brought in another prize, and so"
"pleased the Dey that he presented him with a scimitar, the hilt of which"
was set with diamonds.
"Thwaites, having soiled his hands with blood, now became the pirate"
"indeed, taking vessels of any nation, and drowning all his prisoners by"
tying a double-headed shot round their necks and throwing them overboard.
"He stopped at no atrocity--even children were killed, and one prisoner, an"
"English lieutenant and an old shipmate of his, called Roberts, he murdered"
"without a second thought. When Thwaites happened to be near Gibraltar, he"
"were so, why should we make the least objection? But in the hypothesis"
that the introduction of civilisation has in view neither amelioration
"of the condition of the natives nor progress of commerce and industry,"
we might then conceive a sort of suspicion. Supposing that you augment
"the garrisons, the fortifications, the naval forces, one would see in it"
nothing but an expansion of your military power and not an introduction
of civilisation in the sense understood in France. Even in that case we
"would not raise objections, unless it were done with a view to menace"
us; but here I shall offer you a suggestion. Is it really worth your
while to develop there incessantly your military and naval forces in
order to oppose Japan? Would not the enterprise be rather costly? Would
it not be infinitely better to employ your energy in cultivating a good
understanding between your country and ours instead of rivalling each
other by crossing armaments?

THE AUSTRALIAN QUESTION[1]
AN INTERVIEW
Baron Suyematsu gave a _Daily News_ representative his opinion of the
"'Spectre of Japan' as conceived by many Europeans. The Japanese Baron, a"
"burly, cheerful man, laughed heartily as he dealt with the alarmist"
fears of the 'Yellow Peril.'
"He pointed to the four men who still stood by the wall, the firing party"
"at attention before them, and the eyes of all on the next wave of the"
general's hand which would mean life or death.
La Giralda drew a quick breath. Would the hold she had over him be
sufficient for what she was about to ask? He was a fierce man and a
"cruel, this Ramon Cabrera, who loved naught in the world except his"
"mother, and had gained his present ascendency in the councils of Don"
Carlos by the unbending and consistent ferocity of his conduct.
"""These are no traitors, General,"" she said; ""they are true men, and deep"
"in the councils of the cause."""
She bent and whispered in his ear words which others could not hear. The
"face of the Carlist general darkened from a dull pink to purple, and"
then his colour ebbed away to a ghastly ashen white as he listened.
"Twice he sprang up from the stone bench where he had seated himself,"
"ground his heel into the gravel brought from the river-bed beneath, and"
"muttered a characteristic imprecation, ""Ten for one of their women I"
"have slain already--by San Vicente after this it shall be a hundred!"""
For La Giralda was telling him the tale of his mother's shooting by
Nogueras.
"Then all suddenly he reseated himself, and beckoned to Concha."
"""Come hither,"" he said; ""let me see these fellows' papers, and tell me"
"how they came into your hands!"""
Concha was ready.
dated between 1520 and 1540) thus late is justified by the fact that he
"is in some ways 'before his time', notably in his rejection of the"
Morality abstractions.]

CHAPTER IV
RISE OF COMEDY AND TRAGEDY
"No great discernment is required to see that, after the appearance of"
"_Johan Johan_, all that was needed for the complete development of"
comedy was the invention of a well-contrived plot. For reasons already
"indicated, Interludes were naturally deficient in this respect. Nor were"
the Moralities and Bible Miracles much better: their length and
"comprehensive themes were against them. There were the Saint Plays, of"
which some still lingered upon the stage; these offered greater
"possibilities. But here, again, originality was limited; the"
"_dénouement_ was more or less a foregone conclusion. Clearly, one of two"
things was wanted: either a man of genius to perceive the need and to
"supply it, or the study of new models outside the field of English"
"drama. The man of genius was not then forthcoming, but by good fortune"
the models were stumbled upon.
"We say stumbled upon, because the absence of tentative predecessors and"
"of anything approaching an eager band of successors, suggests an"
unpreparedness for the discovery when it came. Thus _Calisto and
"Melibaea_ (1530), an imitation of a Spanish comedy of the same name,"
Books of the beginning of last century to realise the difference of
appeal. Everything offered then was either an appeal to fear or to
"priggishness, and one wonders how it is that our grandparents and their"
parents ever recovered from the effects of such stories as were offered
to them. But there is the consoling thought that no lasting impression
"was made upon them, such as I believe _may_ be possible by the right"
kind of story.
I offer a few examples of the old type of story:
Here is an encouraging address offered by a certain Mr. Janeway to
children about the year 1828:
"“Dare you do anything which your parents forbid you, and neglect to"
"do what they command? Dare you to run up and down on the Lord's Day,"
"or do you keep in to read your book, and learn what your good parents"
command?”
Such an address would have almost tempted children to envy the lot of
"orphans, except that the guardians and less close relations might have"
"been equally, if not more, severe."
"From “The Curious Girl,” published about 1809: “Oh! papa, I hope you"
"will have no reason to be dissatisfied with me, for I love my studies"
"very much, and I am never so happy at my play as when I have been"
assiduous at my lessons all day.”
"“Adolphus: How strange it is, papa, you should believe it possible for"
"me to act so like a child, now that I am twelve years old!”"
Here is a specimen taken from a Chap-book about 1825:
"father, and two other men. Susanna was most smart; she greeted Laura and"
"Cæsar very affably, and presented her father, Mr. Russell; then she"
"presented an English author, tall, skinny, with blue eyes, a white"
"beard, and hair like a halo; and then a young Englishman from the"
"Embassy, a very distinguished person named Kennedy, who was a Catholic."
_TEA_
"After the introductions they passed into the dining-room, which was"
"most impressive. It was an exhibition of very smart women, some of"
"them ideally beautiful, and idle men. All about them resounded a nasal"
English of the American sort.
Susanna Marchmont served the tea and did the honours to her guests.
"They all talked French, excepting Mr. Russell, who once in a long while"
uttered some categorical monosyllable in his own language.
Mr. Russell was not of the classic Yankee type; he looked like a vulgar
"Englishman. He was a serious man, with a short moustache, grey-headed,"
with three or four gold teeth.
What to Cæsar seemed wonderful in this gentleman was his economy of
"words. There was not one useless expression in his vocabulary, and"
"not the slightest redundancy; whatever partook of merit, prestige, or"
"nobility was condensed, for him, to the idea of value; whatever partook"
"of arrangement, cleanliness, order, was condensed to the word “comfort”;"
"so that Mr. Russell, with a very few words, had everything specified."
"To Susanna, imbued with her preoccupation in supreme _chic_, her father"
no doubt did not seem a completely decorative father; but he gave Cæsar
"for their boots were soaked through and their heavy buffalo overcoats,"
"caps and ear-muffs were covered with snow, which all, save Rance,"
proceeded to remove by shaking their shoulders and stamping their feet.
"The latter, however, calmly took off his gloves, pulled out a"
"beautifully-creased handkerchief from his pocket, and began slowly to"
flick off the snow from his elegant mink overcoat before hanging it
carefully upon a peg on the wall. After that he went over to the table
"and warmed his hands over the lighted candle there. Meanwhile, Sonora,"
"his nose, as well as his hands which with difficulty he removed from his"
"heavy fur mittens, showing red and swollen from the effects of the"
"biting cold, had gone over to the fire, where he ejaculated:"
"""Ouf, I'm cold! Glad you're safe, Girl!"""
"""Yes, Girl, The Polka's had a narrow squeak,"" observed Nick, stamping"
"his feet which, as well as his legs, were wrapped with pieces of"
blankets for added warmth.
"Unconsciously, at his words, the Girl's eyes travelled to the bed; then,"
"drawing her robe snugly about her, and seating herself, she asked with"
suppressed excitement:
"""Why, Nick, what's the matter? What's--"""
Rance took it upon himself to do the answering. Sauntering over to the
"Girl, he drawled out:"
"""It takes you a long time to get up, seems to me. You haven't so much"
"on, either,"" he went on, piercing her with his eyes."
"Smilingly and not in the least disconcerted by the Sheriff's remark, the"
Girl picked up a rug from the floor and wound it about her knees.
"Commanded a Dutch vessel, the _Edward and Thomas_, that sailed from Boston"
"in 1674, and took several small English vessels along the coast of Maine."

but was afterwards pardoned.

"As the life of this famous navigator and privateer is, very justly,"
"treated fully in the ""Dictionary of National Biography"" it is unnecessary"
to mention more than a few incidents in his adventurous career. Woodes
"Rogers was not only a good navigator, for on many occasions he showed a"
remarkable gift for commanding mutinous crews in spite of having many
"officers on whom he could place little reliance. On leaving Cork in 1708,"
after an incompetent pilot had almost run his ship on two rocks off
"Kinsale called ""The Sovereigne's Bollacks,"" Rogers describes his crew"
"thus: ""A third were foreigners, while of Her Majestie's subjects many were"
"taylors, tinkers, pedlars, fiddlers, and hay-makers, with ten boys and one"
"negro."" It was with crews such as these that many of the boldest and most"
"remarkable early voyages were made, and they required a man of Woodes"
Rogers stamp to knock them into sailors. Rogers had a gift for inspiring
"friendship wherever he went. On arriving at the coast of Brazil, his boat"
was fired on when trying to land at Angre de Reys. This settlement had but
lately received several hostile visitors in the way of French pirates. But
before a week was passed Woodes Rogers had so won the hearts of the
"Portuguese Governor and the settlers that he and his ""musick"" were invited"
"entirely forgotten the circumstances of this dream, again had a vivid"
dream of murder after eating pheasant at night; this time it was she
"herself who was to be killed, and she awoke imagining that she was"
struggling with the would-be murderer.]

"[Footnote 94: Dreams of railway travelling, and especially of losing"
"trains, are not always associated with headache or any other recognisable"
condition. They constitute a very common type of dream not quite easy to
"explain. Dr. Savage mentions, for instance, that in his own case scarcely"
"a week passes without such a dream, though in real life he scarcely ever"
loses a train and never worries about it. Wundt considers that the dreams
in which we seek something we cannot find or have left something behind
are due to indefinite coenaesthesic disturbances involving feelings of
"the same emotional tone, such as an uncomfortable position or a slight"
irregularity of respiration. I have myself independently observed the same
"connection, though it is not invariably traceable.]"

The process of electrotyping is one of the most interesting steps in
"the making of a book, and authors will find it well worth while to"
brave the grime of the black-lead in order to become familiar with the
"detail. In brief, the type form is pressed down into a tablet made of"
"wax or similar substance, in which it leaves an impression. This wax"
"tablet is then allowed to remain in a galvanic bath, through which it"
"becomes covered with a coating of copper. When separated from the wax,"
"the thin, copper replica of the composed type is backed up by an alloy,"
"and, after passing through various stages in finishing, finally becomes"
an electrotype plate.[39]
COVER DESIGN AND ILLUSTRATIONS
While the printer has been engaged in putting the manuscript into
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. The heavy near-shore formations of the
Silurian in the Appalachian region thin out toward the west. The
"Medina and the Clinton sandstones are not found west of Ohio,"
where the first passes into a shale and the second into a
"limestone. The Niagara limestone, however, spreads from the Hudson"
"River to beyond the Mississippi, a distance of more than a"
thousand miles. During the Silurian period the Mississippi valley
"region was covered with a quiet, shallow, limestone-making sea,"
which received little waste from the low lands which bordered it.
The probable distribution of land and sea in eastern North America
and western Europe is shown in Figure 287. The fauna of the
interior region and of eastern Canada are closely allied with that
"of western Europe, and several species are identical. We can"
hardly account for this except by a shallow-water connection
between the two ancient epicontinental seas. It was perhaps along
the coastal shelves of a northern land connecting America and
Europe by way of Greenland and Iceland that the migration took
"place, so that the same species came to live in Iowa and in"
Sweden.
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. So little is found of the rocks of the
system west of the Missouri River that it is quite probable that
the western part of the United States had for the most part
emerged from the sea at the close of the Ordovician and remained
land during the Silurian. At the same time the western land was
perhaps connected with the eastern land of Appalachia across
Arkansas and Mississippi; for toward the south the Silurian
sediments indicate an approach to shore.

MONROE DOCTRINE OF THE PAST
'America's relation to this problem is more difficult. Monroeism is
thought to stand in the way. I appreciate the delicacy of venturing to
"discuss the policy of a nation other than my own, but I feel that"
Americans are too sensible to resent an honest expression of opinion.
"Monroeism is not part of the constitution, but the dictum of a"
"statesman. This dictum was made when our planet was very large, before"
the development of steam and electricity. The nations were isolated and
insulated by distance and non-communication.
'At that time American theory and practice relative to foreign affairs
"were in harmony. America was actually self-contained, but to-day the"
world is a tiny ball and America's flag and America's interests are on
"every sea. America is sovereign in Hawaii and the Philippines, and yet"
the American people cling to the idea of leaving distant matters alone.
Nevertheless the state department is widely and intelligently active.
AMERICAN INTEREST WORLD-WIDE
"'Theoretically you do not participate, actually your participation bears"
upon international events everywhere. Witness Secretary Hay's initiative
"respecting the Jews, as well as despatch after despatch aimed at Russian"
aggression in Manchuria. The world's interests are becoming woven into a
solid fabric. Great nations cannot escape the responsibility this
"involves. American theory and practice, in my judgment, will go on"
diverging until the notion of non-participation will be merely an
antiquated abstraction.
"[Footnote 109: 'The wish to be able to fly,' he declares (_Eine"
"Kindheitserinnerung des Leonardo da Vinci_, p. 59), 'signifies in dreaming"
nothing else but the desire to be capable of sexual activities. It is a
wish of early childhood.']

fails to state when the ancestors of man inhabited these problematical
planets.]
[Footnote 111: I retain this statement of my explanation in almost the
same words as first written down in 1895. I was not then aware that
several psychologists had offered very similar explanations. Scherner
"(_Das Leben des Traumes_, 1861) seems to have been the first to connect"
"the lungs with dreams of flying, though he put forward the explanation"
"in too fanciful a form and failed to realise that other factors, notably"
"a change in skin pressure, are also involved. Strümpell at a later date"
"recognised this explanation, as well as Wundt.]"
[Footnote 112: It is the same with chloroform. 'There are marked
"sensations in the vicinity of the heart,' says Elmer Jones ('The Waning"
"of Consciousness under Chloroform,' _Psychological Review_, January"
"1909). 'The musculature of that organ seems thoroughly stimulated, and"
the contractions become violent and accelerated. The palpitations are
as strong as would be experienced at the close of some violent bodily
"exertion.' It is significant, also, as bearing on the interpretation of"
"the dream of flying, that under chloroform 'all movements made appeared to"
"are characterized, the one by the dominance of fishes, and the"
other by the appearance of amphibians and reptiles.
"Each of these systems is world-wide in its distribution, and may"
be recognized on any continent by its own peculiar fauna. The
names first given them in Great Britain have therefore come into
"general use, while their subdivisions, which often cannot be"
"correlated in different countries and different regions, are"
usually given local names.
The first three systems were named from the fact that their strata
are well displayed in Wales. The Cambrian carries the Roman name
"of Wales, and the Ordovician and Silurian the names of tribes of"
ancient Britons which inhabited the same country. The Devonian is
"named from the English county Devon, where its rocks were early"
studied. The Carboniferous was so called from the large amount of
coal which it was found to contain in Great Britain and
continental Europe.
THE CAMBRIAN
DISTRIBUTION OF STRATA. The Cambrian rocks outcrop in narrow belts
about the pre-Cambrian areas of eastern Canada and the Lake
"Superior region, the Adirondacks and the Green Mountains. Strips"
of Cambrian formations occupy troughs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of
New England and the maritime provinces of Canada; a long belt
borders on the west the crystalline rocks of the Blue Ridge; and
on the opposite side of the continent the Cambrian reappears in
the mountains of the Great Basin and the Canadian Rockies. In the
Mississippi valley it is exposed in small districts where uplift
has permitted the stripping off of younger rocks. Although the
"areas of outcrop are small, we may infer that Cambrian rocks were"
we reach the words of Nebuchadnezzar's dramatic recantation.
"In this connection, it is a good plan occasionally during the story"
"hour to introduce really good poetry which, delivered in a dramatic"
"manner (far removed, of course, from the melodramatic), might give"
children their first love of beautiful form in verse. And I do not
think it necessary to wait for this. Even the normal child of seven
(though there is nothing arbitrary in the suggestion of this age) will
appreciate the effect--if only on the ear--of beautiful lines well
"spoken. Mahomet has said, in his teaching advice: “Teach your children"
"poetry: it opens the mind, lends grace to wisdom and makes heroic"
virtues hereditary.”
"To begin with the youngest children of all, here is a poem which"
"contains a thread of story, just enough to give a human interest:"
MILKING-TIME.
"When the cows come home, the milk is coming,"
Honey's made when the bees are humming.
"Duck, Drake on the rushy lake,"
"And the deer live safe in the breezy brake,"
"And timid, funny, pert little bunny"
"Winks his nose, and sits all sunny."

"Now, in comparing this poem with some of the doggerel verse offered"
"to small children, one is struck with the literary superiority in the"
"choice of words. Here, in spite of the simplicity of the poem, there"
"is not the ordinary limited vocabulary, nor the forced rhyme, nor the"
"application of a moral, by which the artist falls from grace."
"itself.""[7] The mere Ã¦sthetic sensibility makes but a new artist; what"
"makes the critic is his philosophy. Here also, however, as during the"
"whole course of our inquiry, we must not identify philosophy with the"
"official history of philosophical disciplines, which offers a large"
number of theories of Ã¦sthetics only remotely related to the concrete
"works of art, to the concrete processes of Ã¦sthetic creation, but with"
"the whole history of human thought, with the working out of particular"
problems successively presented to the intelligence of man by the
"actual developments of poetry and art. The Ã¦sthetic judgment, like"
"every other judgment, is a synthesis of the individual intuition, or"
"subject, and of the universal category, or predicate; and this is but"
"another way of stating the identity of Ã¦sthetic criticism, as of all"
"forms of history, with philosophy. The critic must be endowed with a"
"power to give new life, within his own mind, to the intuitions of the"
"artist, but this is for him but the soil in which his thought must"
"spread its roots; it is true that without that power, no criticism"
"is possible, but it is equally true that no philosophy of art can"
grow on any but that same soil. The ultimate test of the validity of
Ã¦sthetic thought is in its capacity to expand our sphere of Ã¦sthetic
apprehension; and pure Ã¦sthetics is but the methodological moment of
Ã¦sthetic history or criticism.

"men of learning, men of character who will take on themselves the burden"
"of the world."" Such is the prophetic vision given to the greatest of"
teachers. The modern teacher from England will set before him an ideal
"not less exalted--regarding his pupils as his comrades, he as an"
Englishman will instill into them greater virility and a greater public
spirit. This will be his special contribution to the forming of our
Indian youths.
Turning to the Indian students he could say that it was his good fortune
never to have had the harmonious relation between teacher and pupils in
any way ruffled during his long connection with them for more than three
decades. The real secret of success was in trying at times to see things
from the student's point of view and to cultivate a sense of humour
enabling him to enjoy the splendid self-assurance of youth with a
"feeling not unmixed with envy. In essential matters, however, one could"
not wish to meet a better type or one more quickly susceptible to finer
appeals to right conduct and duty as Indian students. Their faults are
"rather of omission than of commission, since in his experience he formed"
"that the moment they realised their teachers to be their friends, they"
"responded instantly and did not flinch from any test, however severe,"
that could be laid on them.

LONG DELAYED SUCCESS
"And when the night was at its darkest, light gradually appeared, and"
after innumerable difficulties had been overcome his Resonant Recorder
"was perfected, which enabled the plant to tell its own story. And in"
the meantime something still more wonderful came to pass. Hitherto all
gates had been barred and he had to produce his passports everywhere. He
now found friends who never asked him for credentials. His time had come
at last. The Royal Society found his new methods most convincing and
honoured him by publication of his researches in the Philosophical
"transactions. And his discoveries, which had so long remained in"
"obscurity, found enthusiastic acceptance."
Though his theories had thus received acceptance from the leading
"scientific men of the Royal Society, there was yet no general conviction"
of the identity of life reactions in plant and animal. No amount of
controversy can remove the tendency of the human mind to follow
precedents. The only thing left was to make the plant itself bear
"witness before the scientific bodies in the West, by means of"
"self-records. At the recommendation of the Minister of Education, and of"
"the Government of Bengal, the Secretary of State sanctioned his"
scientific deputation to Europe and America.
JOURNEY OF INDIAN PLANT ROUND THE WORLD
The special difficulty which he had to contend against lay in the fact
"that the only time during which the plant flourished at all in the West,"
"was in the months of July and August, when the Universities and"
scientific societies were in vacation. The only thing left was to take
the bold step of carrying growing plants from India and trust to human
"not born a princess! It goes to my heart to make her a prisoner!"""

Finally it was judged that they should make a night march over the

San Ildefonso and La Granja are two of the most strangely situated
places in Spain. A high and generally snow-clad Sierra divides them from
Madrid and the south. The palace is one of the most high-lying upon
"earth, having originally been one of the mountain granges of the monks"
"of Segovia to which a king of Spain took a fancy, and, what is more"
"remarkable, for which he was willing to pay good money."
"Upon the site a palace has been erected, a miniature Versailles,"
"infinitely more charming than the original, with walks, fountains,"
"waterfalls all fed by the cold snow water of the Guadarrama, and fanned"
by the pure airs of the mountains. This Grange has been for centuries a
"favourite resort of the Court of Spain, and specially during these last"
"years of the Regent Cristina, who, when tired with the precision and"
"etiquette of the Court of Madrid, retired hither that she might do as"
she pleased for at least two or three months of the year.
"odor, free from yeastiness and a fruity, agreeable, slightly spirituous"
"taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. The Pharmacopoeia (1890)"
"directs that the wine should contain from 7 to 12 per cent, by weight,"
"of absolute alcohol. California Hock and Reisling, Ohio Catawba, Sherry,"
"Muscatel, Madeira or the stronger wines of the Rhine, Mediterranean and"
Hungary come within the pharmacopoeial limits. Wines containing more
"than 14 per cent of alcohol are usually fortified, i. e., have alcohol"
"or brandy added to them, and much imported Sherry and Madeira contain 15"

"yeastiness, and a fruity moderately astringent, pleasant and slightly"
"acidulous taste, without excessive sweetness or acidity. Should contain"
"not less than 7 nor more than 12 per cent, by weight, of alcohol. Native"
"Claret, Burgundy, Bordeaux and Hungarian wines may be included within"
the pharmacopoeial limits of vinum rubrum. Port (vinum portense) is
"fortified with brandy during fermentation, and contains 15 to 25 per"
"cent, by weight, of absolute alcohol. Port is astringent from tannic"
"acid in the grapes, skin and stalks, or the astringency may be due to"
"logwood. Red wines are said to be rough, contain tannic acid and"
therefore are astringents. Dry wines are those which contain little
sugar. The wines develop ethers with age and these improve their flavor

who figures so largely in our own southwestern Indian country is unknown
there. Unquestionably during the feverish days of the Spaniards’ hunt
"for gold the tribes were frightfully thinned out, and even today"
sections of the country which writers of Balboa’s time describe as
thickly populated are desert and untenanted. Yet much land is still held
"by its aboriginal owners, and unless the operation of the Canal shall"
turn American settlement that way will continue so to be held. The
Panamanian has not the energy to dislodge the Indians nor to till their
lands if he should possess them.
"Many studies of the Panama Indians as a body, or of isolated tribes,"
"have been made by explorers or scientists, and mainly by French or"
Spanish students. The Smithsonian Institution catalogues forty-seven
publications dealing with the subject. But there is an immense mine of
anthropological information yet to be worked in the Isthmus. It is not
"to be acquired readily or without heavy expenditure of energy, patience"
and money. A thoroughly scientific exploring expedition to unravel the
"riddle of the Darien, to count and describe the Indian tribes of the"
"Isthmus, and to record and authenticate traditions dating back to the"
"Spanish days, would be well worth the while of a geographical society, a"
university or some patron of exploring enterprises.
CHAPTER XVII
SOCIAL LIFE ON THE CANAL ZONE
THE CREW OF THE _KAMMA FUNDER_.
"The stars of European science, who had been shining in a wonderful"
"constellation over Quebec, were just about to leave Canada in that"
"well-known comfortable liner, the _Nipigon_, when a most annoying"
"thing happened.  The cattle-ship _Abbitibbe_, never famous at any"
"time for minding her helm, got her steam steering gear jammed as she"
"was passing the _Nipigon_, and took a wide sheer to port when she"
should have altered her course to starboard.  The peaceful
"preparations of the passenger boat were broken up, and her crew"
"received the wild charge of the _Abbitibbe_ with curses, which,"
"though effectual in heating the atmosphere, were no use as a fender."
"The _Nipigon_ was cut down to the water's edge, and the scientific"
lights of Europe were much put out.  They hurried ashore in the most
"irregular and unscientific manner, and, having sent others for their"
"baggage, began to make preparations for going to New York, as no"
other good passenger boat was leaving the St. Lawrence for a week.
"But Nature, possibly out of revenge for the unseemly curiosity"
"evinced by all men of science, was beforehand with them."
"Misfortunes, as was once observed by an intelligent, if pessimistic,"
"anthropoid ape, never come singly.  It was the twelfth of November,"
"and a sudden blizzard, bringing all the snow it could carry, broke up"
communication with the south.  If the men of science were to keep
"their appointments with their universities, it was necessary to sail"
from Canada at once.  They shipped themselves under protest upon the
"_Nemagosenda_, of 2,900 tons register, which was little better than a"
"tramp, and was commanded by Captain Joseph Prowse."
"together apart like old friends. John Mortimer and Etienne, who"
"generally had little to say to each other, conversed freely upon"
wine-growing and the possibility of introducing cotton-spinning into the
South of France. For Etienne was not destitute of a certain Gascon eye
to the main chance.
Rollo alone rode gloomily apart. He was turning over the terms of his
"commission in his mind, and the more he thought, the less was he"
satisfied. It was not alone the desperateness of the venture that
"daunted Rollo, but the difficulty of providing for the Queen-Regent and"
little princess when captured. There were a couple of hundred miles to
ride back to those northern fastnesses where they would be safe; for the
most part without cover and through country swarming with Nationals and
Cristino partisans.
"Riding thus in deep meditation, Rollo, whose gaze was usually so alert,"
did not observe away to the right a couple of horses ridden at speed and
rapidly overtaking their more tired beasts.
"El Sarria, however, did not fail to note them, but, fearing a belated"
"message of recall from General Cabrera, he did not communicate his"
"discovery to his companions, contenting himself with keeping his eye"
upon the approaching riders.
"Rollo was therefore still advancing, his reins flung loosely upon his"
"beast's neck and his whole attitude betokening a melancholy resignation,"
"a couple of lengths before his companions, when a sudden clattering of"
"hoofs startled him. He looked up, and there, on her white mare,"
"well-lathered at girth and bridle, was little Concha Cabezos, sitting"
her panting beast with the grace of the true Andaluse.
Her hair was a little ruffled by the wind. Her cheeks and lips were
It was time to give the almost overheated starboard guns a chance to
"cool, so orders were given for the helm to be starboarded. Seeing the"
"cruiser in the act of turning, a destroyer tore across her bows,"
purposely throwing out huge volumes of black smoke from her four
"funnels in order to mask the ""Sunderland"" as she circled."
"Terence recognized the destroyer as his old ship the ""Livingstone,"""
"as she darted swiftly round the turning cruiser, then, leaving a"
"thick pall of smoke in her wake, hastened off to assist another"
destroyer that was evidently in difficulties.
"The ""Livingstone's"" manoeuvre undoubtedly saved the ""Sunderland"" from"
"destruction, for a fifty-two centimetre shell, aimed to hit the exact"
position where the cruiser would have been had she not altered
"course, struck the water with a tremendous splash not fifty yards on"
her beam.
"Before the ""Sunderland"" had drawn clear of the friendly cloud of"
smoke she had increased her distance from shore by nearly five
"cables' lengths; while, until the German gunners had found the range"
"anew, she was able to enjoy a brief respite."
"""Seaplanes returning,"" announced the gunnery-lieutenant on the"
"fire-control platform, who from his elevated post could command a"
wide and almost uninterrupted view.
"Their task done, the seaplanes, which had been engaged in dropping"
"bombs on the railway stations in the rear of the German batteries,"
were on their homeward way. Anxiously Terence counted them. Thank
heaven! Not one was missing.
Apparently the last but one of the aerial procession was in
other work which might help their country in its need.
And Bertie Adams?
When he realized that his beloved and revered Miss Warren was shut
"off from escape in Belgium, could not be heard of, could not be got"
"at and rescued, he went nearly off his nut.... He reviewed during a"
succession of sleepless nights what course he might best pursue. His
age was about thirty-two. He might of course enlist in the army. But
"though very patriotic, his allegiance lay first at the feet of Vivie"
"Warren. If he entered the army, he might be sent anywhere but to the"
Belgian frontier; and even if he got near Belgium he could not dart
off to rescue Vivie without becoming a deserter. So he came speedily
"to the conclusion that the most promising career he could adopt,"
"having regard to his position in life and lack of resources, was to"
"volunteer for foreign service under the Y.M.C.A., and express the"
strongest possible wish to be employed as near Belgium as was
"practicable. So that by the end of September, 1914, Bertie was"
"serving out cocoa and biscuits, writing paper and cigarettes, hot"
coffee and sausages and cups of bovril to exhausted or resting
"soldiers in the huts of the Y.M.C.A., near Ypres. Alternating with"
"these services, he was, like other Y.M.C.A. men in the same district"
"and at the same time, acting as stretcher bearer to bring in the"
"wounded, as amateur chaplain with the dying, as amateur surgeon with"
"the wounded, as secretary to some distraught officer in high command"
whose clerks had all been killed; and in any other capacity if
called upon. But always with the stedfast hope and purpose that he
might somehow reach and rescue Vivie Warren.
CHAPTER I
PARENTAGE AND EARLY YEARS
"""I was born when my country was perishing. Thirty thousand French"
"vomited upon our coasts, drowning the throne of Liberty in waves of"
"blood, such was the sight which struck my eyes."" This passionate"
"utterance, penned by Napoleon Buonaparte at the beginning of the"
"French Revolution, describes the state of Corsica in his natal year."
The words are instinct with the vehemence of the youth and the
extravagant sentiment of the age: they strike the keynote of his
career. His life was one of strain and stress from his cradle to his
grave.
In his temperament as in the circumstances of his time the young
Buonaparte was destined for an extraordinary career. Into a tottering
civilization he burst with all the masterful force of an Alaric. But
"he was an Alaric of the south, uniting the untamed strength of his"
island kindred with the mental powers of his Italian ancestry. In his
"personality there is a complex blending of force and grace, of animal"
"passion and mental clearness, of northern common sense with the"
promptings of an oriental imagination; and this union in his nature of
seeming opposites explains many of the mysteries of his life.
"Fortunately for lovers of romance, genius cannot be wholly analyzed,"
even by the most adroit historical philosophizer or the most exacting
champion of heredity. But in so far as the sources of Napoleon's power
"can be measured, they may be traced to the unexampled needs of mankind"
"called to their action stations when a faint buzzing, immediately"
"becoming louder and louder, announced that the raiders were"
approaching the town and harbour of Dover.
"Searchlights flashed skywards, while from beneath the old castle on"
the lofty chalk cliffs half a dozen intrepid British airmen ascended
to meet the foe. Already the anti-aerial guns were stabbing the
"darkness with lurid spurts of flame, while their shells, bursting"
"perilously close to the hostile aeroplanes, caused the calculating"
Teutons to think better of the attempt.
It was an easy matter to steal over an unfortified town or village
and drop explosives; but for once the Germans were to learn the
"wisdom of discrimination. Higher and higher they banked, until"
catching a glimpse of the British seaplanes as they passed through
the path of one of the searchlights they precipitately turned tail.
"""'Sunderland' and destroyer flotilla to proceed in support of"
"seaplanes,"" came the signal."
Hastily the pins of the mooring shackle were knocked out. Steam was
"already raised, and in a very few minutes the light cruiser and her"
attendant destroyers were slipping between the heads of the detached
breakwater and the Admiralty Pier.
But swift as were the light cruisers the seaplanes were quicker.
"Already they were five or six miles out to sea, their position being"
revealed by the flashes of the light guns as they exchanged shots
with the fugitive Taubes.
Suddenly with a dazzling flash a bomb exploded hardly twenty feet
"from the ""Sunderland's"" starboard quarter. Five seconds later another"
"1915; H. Wildon Carr, _The Philosophy of B. Croce_, London, 1917. The"
"first is an able, but very cursory sketch; the second examines Croce's"
philosophy from the standpoint of neoscholasticism; the third is an
ample summary written by a distinguished writer well acquainted with
the various currents of modern thought. Each of them ought to be read
with a critical and discriminating eye.
"In the English-speaking world, Croce's fame rests emphatically on his"
"Ã¦sthetics, and its applications to literary criticism. His influence"
on English and American critical thought has already gone much deeper
than a mere list of writings on his theories would show; especially in
"England, his ideas are, so to speak, in the air, and appear in many"
writers who have no direct knowledge of his work. The best exposition
of this phase of his philosophy is to be found in E. F. Carritt's
"book, _The Theory of Beauty_, 1914, chap. XIV. The writings of A. B."
"Walkley, and of J. E. Spingam, contain the most vigorous prosecution"
"of his thought as applied, respectively, to English and to American"
scholarship and criticism.
"For the general history of Italian thought, to which many a reference"
"is made in the course of this book, the best helps, besides Croce's"
"essay on Vico, and B. Spaventa, _La filosofia italiana_, recently"
"reprinted, Bari, 1909, are the historical works of Giovanni Gentile,"
"and especially his _Storia della filosofia italiana_, Milano, n."
d. Gentile is one of the most profound and earnest modern European
"thinkers, and it is desirable that his theoretical works, similar in"
"tendency to, but widely divergent in temper from those of Croce, should"
"become better known to the Anglo-Saxon world. Two of his books, _La"
"Riforma dell' Educazione_ and _Teoria generale dello Spirito_, are soon"
to appear in English. Croce's judgment on Gentile's Actual Idealism is
"expressed in _Una discussione tra filosofi amici_, in _Conversazioni"
"Critiche_, II, pp. 67-95. But a complete understanding of the vital"
and small fishes miraculously multiplied to feed the five thousand;
the linen cloth with which he dried the feet of his apostles; also
"Aaron's rod, the rod with which Moses smote the Red Sea,"" etc., etc."
"(_Cook's Southern Italy_, p. 114.) We did not see these, but in the"
cloister behind this church we were shown a marble slab on pillars
"which was once an altar, ""at which the officiating priest doubted of"
"the Real Presence, when the wafer fell from his hand through the stone,"
"leaving a round hole, which still remains."" Here, too, we were shown"
"a larger slab resting on pillars, more than six feet from the ground,"
"which marks the height of our Saviour; also a porphyry slab, upon which"
the soldiers cast lots for his seamless robe; and some columns from
"Pilate's house in Jerusalem, which were rent by the earthquake of the"
crucifixion.
"[Illustration: THE SCALA SANTA, ROME.]"
[Sidenote: The Holy Stairs from Pilate's Palace.]
"But the great relic of Pilate's House, and one of the most interesting"
"of all the relics in Rome, is across the street from St. John Lateran,"
"viz., the world-renowned _Scala Santa_, or Holy Stairway, a flight of"
"twenty-eight marble steps, once ascended by our Saviour in the palace"
"of Pilate, and brought from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by the Empress"
"Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. They are covered with a wooden"
"casing, but holes have been left through which the marble steps can be"
seen. Two of them are stained with the Saviour's blood. These spots
"are covered with glass. The light was rather dim, and as we entered a"
gentleman struck a match and held it over one of these glass-covered
"stains to show it to his little girl, so that, passing just at that"
"moment, we also had a good view."

"sympathetic listener, whose bright eyes stimulated all his capacities as"
"narrator, and whose bright smile welcomed every hairbreadth escape with"
a joy which Rollo could not but feel must somehow be heartfelt and
"personal. Besides, adventures sound so well when told in Spanish and to"
a Spanish girl.
"Yet, strange as it may seem, the young man missed several opportunities"
of arousing the compassion of his companion.
"He said not a word about Peggy Ramsay, nor did he mention the broken"
"heart which he had come so far afield to curé. And as for Concha,"
nothing could have been more nunlike and conventual than the expression
with which she listened. It was as if one of the Lady Superior's
"""Holiest Innocents"" had flown over the nunnery wall and settled down to"
listen to Rollo's tale in that wild gorge among the mountains of
Guadarrama.
*       *       *       *       *
Meantime the Sergeant and his gipsy companion pursued their way with
little regard to the occupations or sentiments of those they had left
"behind them. Cardono's keen black eyes, twinkling hither and thither, a"
myriad crows' feet reticulating out from their corners like spiders'
"webs, took in the landscape, and every object in it."
"The morning was well advanced when, right across their path, a"
"well-to-do farmhouse lay before them, white on the hillside, its walls"
"long-drawn like fortifications, and the small slit-like windows"
counterfeiting loopholes for musketry. But instead of the hum of work
"and friendly gossip, the crying of ox-drivers yoking their teams, or"
"adjusting the long blue wool over the patient eyes of their beasts,"
"there reigned about the place, both dwelling and office-houses, a"
In this brief sketch it is quite impossible to relate the many
changes of species and genera during the Silurian.
CORALS. Some of the more common types are familiarly known as cup
"corals, honeycomb corals, and chain corals. In the CUP CORALS the"
most important feature is the development of radiating vertical
"partitions, or SEPTA, in the cell of the polyp. Some of the cup"
"corals grew in hemispherical colonies (Fig. 288), while many were"
"separate individuals (Fig. 289), building a single conical, or"
"horn-shaped cell, which sometimes reached the extreme size of a"
foot in length and two or three inches in diameter.
"HONEYCOMB CORALS consist of masses of small, close-set prismatic"
"cells, each crossed by horizontal partitions, or TABULAE, while"
"the septa are rudimentary, being represented by faintly projecting"
ridges or rows of spines.
CHAIN CORALS are also marked by tabulae. Their cells form
"elliptical tubes, touching each other at the edges, and appearing"
in cross section like the links of a chain. They became extinct at
the end of the Silurian.
The corals of the SYRINGOPORA family are similar in structure to
"chain corals, but the tubular columns are connected only in"
places.
To the echinoderms there is now added the BLASTOID (bud-shaped).
"The blastoid is stemmed and armless, and its globular ""head"" or"
"""calyx,"" with its five petal-like divisions, resembles a flower"
"bud. The blastoids became more abundant in the Devonian,"
"culminated in the Carboniferous, and disappeared at the end of the"
Paleozoic.
"discovered embrace all the leading types of invertebrate life, and"
are so varied that we must believe that their lines of descent
stretch far back into the pre-Cambrian past.
"PLANTS. No remains of plants have been found in Cambrian strata,"
"except some doubtful markings, as of seaweed."
"SPONGES. The sponges, the lowest of the multicellular animals,"
were represented by several orders. Their fossils are recognized
"by the siliceous spicules, which, as in modern sponges, either"
were scattered through a mass of horny fibers or were connected in
a flinty framework.
COELENTERATES. This subkingdom includes two classes of interest to
"the geologist,--the HYDROZOA, such as the fresh-water hydra and"
"the jellyfish, and the CORALS. Both classes existed in the"
Cambrian.
The Hydrozoa were represented not only by jellyfish but also by
"the GRAPTOLITE, which takes its name from a fancied resemblance of"
some of its forms to a quill pen. It was a composite animal with a
"horny framework, the individuals of the colony living in cells"
"strung on one or both sides along a hollow stem, and communicating"
by means of a common flesh in this central tube. Some graptolites
"were straight, and some curved or spiral; some were single"
"stemmed, and others consisted of several radial stems united."
Graptolites occur but rarely in the Upper Cambrian. In the
"Ordovician and Silurian they are very plentiful, and at the close"
"of the Silurian they pass out of existence, never to return."
"CORALS are very rarely found in the Cambrian, and the description"
of their primitive types is postponed to later chapters treating
re-captors to proceed to adjudication till her return to a port of His
Majesty's dominions.
"(2) The master or owner, or his agent, may, with the consent of the"
"re-captors, unload and dispose of the goods on board the ship before"
adjudication.
"(3) If the ship does not, within six months, return to a port of His"
"Majesty's dominions, the re-captors may nevertheless institute"
"proceedings against the ship or goods in the High Court, or in any prize"
"court in a British possession, and the court may thereupon award prize"
"salvage as aforesaid to the re-captors, and may enforce payment thereof,"
"either by warrant of arrest against the ship or goods, or in the same"
manner as a judgment of the court in which the proceedings are
instituted may be enforced.
_Prize Bounty._
[Sidenote: Prize bounty to officers and crew present in case of capture
"or destruction of enemy's ship. [27 & 28 Vict. c. 25, s. 42.]]"
"32. If, in relation to any war, His Majesty is pleased to declare, by"
"proclamation or Order in Council, his intention to grant prize bounty to"
"the officers and crews of his ships of war, then such of the officers"
and crew of any of His Majesty's ships of war as are actually present at
the taking or destroying of any armed ship of any of His Majesty's
enemies shall be entitled to have distributed among them as prize bounty
a sum calculated at such rates and in such manner as may be specified in
the proclamation or Order in Council.

ASIA MINOR.
The first Oriental religion adopted by the Romans was that of the goddess
"of Phrygia, whom the people of Pessinus and Mount Ida worshiped, and who"
received the name of _Magna Mater deum Idea_ in the Occident. Its history
"in Italy covers six centuries, and we can trace each phase of the"
transformation that changed it in the course of time from a collection of
very primitive nature beliefs into a system of spiritualized mysteries used
by some as a weapon against Christianity. We shall now endeavor to outline
the successive phases of that slow metamorphosis.
This religion is the only one whose success in the Latin world was caused
"originally by a mere chance circumstance. In 205 B. C, when Hannibal,"
"vanquished but still threatening, made his last stand in the mountains of"
"Bruttium, repeated torrents of stones frightened the Roman people. When the"
books were officially consulted in regard to this prodigy they promised
that the enemy would be driven from Italy if the Great Mother of Ida could
be brought to Rome. Nobody but the Sibyls themselves had the power of
averting the evils prophesied by them. They had come to Italy from Asia
"Minor, and in this critical situation their sacred poem recommended the"
practice of their native religion as a remedy. In token of his {47}
"friendship, King Attalus presented the ambassadors of the senate with the"
"black aerolite, supposed to be the abode of the goddess, that this ruler"
had shortly before transferred from Pessinus to Pergamum. According to the
mandate of the oracle the stone was received at Ostia by the best citizen
"of the land, an honor accorded to Scipio Nasica--and carried by the most"
"outline of the history of the Lake Superior region, the"
"deformations which it suffered, their relative severity, the times"
"when they occurred, and the erosion cycles marked by the"
successive unconformities.
OTHER PRE-CAMBRIAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA. Pre-Cambrian rocks are
"exposed in various parts of the continent, usually by the erosion"
of mountain ranges in which their strata were infolded. Large
areas occur in the maritime provinces of Canada. The core of the
"Green Mountains of Vermont is pre-Cambrian, and rocks of these"
systems occur in scattered patches in western Massachusetts. Here
belong also the oldest rocks of the Highlands of the Hudson and of
"New Jersey. The Adirondack region, an outlier of the Laurentian"
"region, exposes pre-Cambrian rocks, which have been metamorphosed"
and tilted by the intrusion of a great boss of igneous rock out of
which the central peaks are carved. The core of the Blue Ridge and
probably much of the Piedmont Belt are of this age. In the Black
Hills the irruption of an immense mass of granite has caused or
accompanied the upheaval of pre-Cambrian strata and metamorphosed
"them by heat and pressure into gneisses, schists, quartzites, and"
slates. In most of these mountainous regions the lowest strata are
"profoundly changed by metamorphism, and they can be assigned to"
the pre-Cambrian only where they are clearly overlain
unconformably by formations proved to be Cambrian by their
"fossils. In the Belt Mountains of Montana, however, the Cambrian"
"is underlain by Algonkian sediments twelve thousand feet thick,"
and but little altered.
MINERAL WEALTH OF THE PRE-CAMBRIAN ROCKS. The pre-Cambrian rocks
"are of very great economic importance, because of their extensive"
metamorphism and the enormous masses of igneous rock which they
involve. In many parts of the country they are the source of
grate the baton-like loaf with a farrier's hoof-rasp which he used in
"his culinary operations. ""But this,"" he added, as he turned over the"
"bird, ""is well stricken in years, and had better be given to the"
recruits. They have young teeth and have had practice upon dead
"artillery mules!"""
"So saying, he went casually to the edge of the little quarry, whistled a"
"peculiar note and tossed the bird downward to some person unseen, who"
appeared from nowhere in particular for the purpose of receiving it.
When the dinner was ready Sergeant Cardono announced it to Rollo as if
he had been serving a prince. And what was the young man's astonishment
"to find a table, covered with a decent white cloth, under the shelter of"
"a limestone rock, spread for three, and complete even to table napkins,"
which the sergeant had tied into various curious shapes.
"As they filed down the slope the sergeant stood at attention, but when"
El Sarria passed he quickly beckoned him aside with a private gesture.
"""You and I will eat after the foreigners,"" he explained."
"El Sarria drew himself up somewhat proudly, but Sergeant Cardono"
whispered in his ear two or three words which appeared to astonish him
"so much that he did as he was bid, and stood aside while John Mortimer"
and Etienne de Saint Pierre seated themselves.
"But Rollo, who had no great love for eating, and considered one man just"
"as much entitled to respect as another, would not sit down till El"
Sarria was accommodated also.
"""May it please your Excellency, Don Ramon and I have much to say to each"
"other,"" quoth the Sergeant, with great respect, ""besides your honour is"
"his family and friends, but, finding a certain demand for the fruit,"
later began to import it systematically. From this casual start the
United Fruit Company and its hustling competitors have grown. The whole
business is the development of a few decades and people still young can
"remember when bananas were sold, each wrapped in tissue paper, for five"
"or ten cents, while today ten or fifteen cents a dozen is a fair price."
"The fruit can be prepared in a multitude of fashions, particularly the"
"coarser varieties of plantains, and the Fruit Company has compiled a"
"banana cook book but has taken little pains to circulate it, the demand"
for the fruit being at times still in excess of the supply. There seems
every indication that the demand is constant and new banana territory is
being steadily developed.
[Illustration: DRYING THE COFFEE BEANS]
Several companies share with the United Fruit Company the Panama market.
The methods of gathering and marketing the crop employed by all are
"practically the same, but the United Fruit Company is used as an"
illustration here because its business is the largest and because it has
so closely followed the Isthmian Canal Commission in its welfare work.
The banana country lies close to the ocean and mainly on the Atlantic
"side of the Isthmus. The lumber industry nestles close to the rivers,"
mainly in the Bayano region. Cocoanuts need the beaches and the sea
"breezes. Native rubber is found in every part of the Republic, though at"
"present it is collected mainly in the Darien, which is true also of"
vegetable ivory. The only gold which is mined on a large scale is taken
from the neighborhood of the Tuyra River in the Darien. But for products
requiring cultivation like cacao and coffee the high lands in the
Chiriqui province offer the best opportunity.
[Illustration: DRYING CLOTHS FOR COFFEE
The time of our Dover journey was one of extreme depletion in the privy
purse. The king had borrowed from every person and every city within the
"realm who, by threats or cajolery, could be induced to part with money."
But now he had reached the end of his tether.
"When matters were thus in extremis, some one, probably Castlemain,"
"suggested the sale of England's possessions on the continent, chief of"
"which was the rich city of Dunkirk, situate on the French side of the"
"Straits of Dover. This fortified city, within a few leagues of Calais,"
"had cost the English nation heavily in blood and gold to gain, and still"
"more heavily to hold, but its value to England commercially and"
politically was beyond measure.
"Since Queen Mary had lost Calais, Dunkirk was the only important foothold"
England had on continental soil; therefore it was almost as dear to the
"English people as the city of London itself. Because of its importance,"
"it was greatly coveted by the French king, who shortly before the time"
of our journey to Dover had made overtures to buy it.
"Charles turned a deaf ear to King Louis's first proposal to buy Dunkirk,"
"not because he loved the city, or cared a farthing for its value to his"
"people, but because he feared the storm of indignation its sale would"
"raise. The Lord Chancellor objected to the sale of Dunkirk, and tried"
to show Charles the great folly of entertaining the offer. He was the
"only wise, honest man in the king's council, and, by reason of his"
"wonderful knowledge of mankind, was called ""the Chancellor of Human"
"Nature."" But the king needed money, so after a time he listened to"
"Berkeley, Crofts, Castlemain, and others of like character, whose"
"strongest argument consisted in accusing the king, most offensively,"
of being afraid of his people.
"""Are you not king?"" asked Castlemain. ""Does not Dunkirk belong to you,"
and _Political Maxims of the State of Holland_ (really written by De
"Witt's friend, Pierre Delacourt; De Witt, however, contributing two"
"chapters), and much attention was given to it here and on the Continent."
In addition to the many and copious histories written in the eighteenth
"century in Dutch, three or four voluminous and competent histories of"
"the Low Countries were written in French--_e.g._, those of Dujardin"
"(1757, etc., 8 vols. 4to), Cerisier (1777, etc., 10 vols. 12mo), Le"
"Clerc (1723-28, 3 vols. folio), Wicquefort (1719, folio, proceeding from"
"Peace of Münster). Of late years, though the lesson is as important as"
"ever, it appears to be less generally attended to. In our own country,"
"however, have appeared Davies' _History of Holland_ (1841, 3 vols.), a"
"careful but not often an illuminating work, which oddly begins with the"
"statement that ""there is scarcely any nation whose history has been so"
"little understood or so generally neglected as that of Holland""; T."

"learning; and the much better known works of Motley, _The Rise of the"
Dutch Republic_ (1856) and the _History of the United Netherlands_
"(1861-68), which deal minutely with only a period of fifty-five years of"
"Dutch history, and of which, as of the work of Davies, the sociological"
value is much below the annalistic. All three are impaired as literature
by their stale rhetoric. The same malady infects the second volume of
"the _Industrial History of the Free Nations_ (1846), by W. Torrens"
"M'Cullagh (afterwards M'Cullagh Torrens); but this, which deals with"
"Holland, is the better section of that treatise, and it gives distinct"

It was this syncretic religion that came to Rome after having enjoyed
popularity in the eastern Mediterranean. Sicily and the south of Italy were
"more than half Hellenized, and the Ptolemies had diplomatic relations with"
"these countries, just as the merchants of Alexandria had commercial"
relations with them. For this reason the worship of Isis spread as rapidly
in those regions as on the coasts of Ionia or in the Cyclades.[22] It was
introduced into Syracuse and Catana during the earliest years of the third
"century by {81} Agathocles. The Serapeum of Pozzuoli, at that time the"
"busiest seaport of Campania, was mentioned in a city ordinance of the year"
"105 B. C.[23] About the same time an Iseum was founded at Pompeii, where"
the decorative frescos attest to this day the power of expansion possessed
by the Alexandrian culture.
"After its adoption by the southern part of the Italian peninsula, this"
religion was bound to penetrate rapidly to Rome. Ever since the second
"century before our era, it could not help but find adepts in the chequered"
multitude of slaves and freedmen. Under the Antonines the college of the
_pastophori_ recalled that it had been founded in the time of Sulla.[24] In
vain did the authorities try to check the invasion of the Alexandrian gods.
"Five different times, in 59, 58, 53, and 48 B. C., the senate ordered their"
"altars and statues torn down,[25] but these violent measures did not stop"
the diffusion of the new beliefs. The Egyptian mysteries were the first
example at Rome of an essentially popular religious movement that was
triumphant over the continued resistance of the public authorities and the
official clergy.
Why was this Egyptian worship the only one of all Oriental religions to
"suffer repeated persecutions? There were two motives, one religious and one"
political.
is the decisive revolution that overtook the sustaining conviction of
"the Church. The central conception, that the universe was called into"
"existence only to further its Creator's purpose toward man, became"
incredible (by the light of the new thought). What seems to careless

decisive quarter of the great battle between theology and a philosophy

manifestation. It came from them; we find them everywhere in that blest
"and superb catastrophe, which formed the conclusion of the past and the"
"opening of the future.... The new society, the desire for equality"
"and concession, and that beginning of fraternity which called itself"
"tolerance, reciprocal good-will, the just accord of men and rights,"

ship was taken by the Welsh pirate Howel Davis. At first Roberts was
"disinclined for the pirate life, but soon changed his mind."
On the death of Davis there were several candidates for the post of
"commander, all brisk and lively men, distinguished by the title of"
"""Lords,"" such as Sympson, Ashplant, Anstis, and others. One of these"
"""Lords,"" Dennis, concluded an eloquent harangue over a bowl of punch with"
a strong appeal for Roberts to be the new chief. This proposal was
"acclaimed with but one dissenting voice, that of ""Lord"" Sympson, who had"
"hopes of being elected himself, and who sullenly left the meeting swearing"
"""he did not care who they chose captain so it was not a papist."" So"
Roberts was elected after being a pirate only six weeks; thus was true
merit quickly appreciated and rewarded amongst them.
[Illustration: CAPTAIN BARTHOLOMEW ROBERTS.
To face p. 262.]
"Roberts's speech to his fellow-pirates was short but to the point, saying"
"""that since he had dipped his hands in muddy water, and must be a pyrate,"
"it was better being a commander than a common man,"" not perhaps a graceful"
"nor grateful way of expressing his thanks, but one which was no doubt"
understood by his audience.
"Roberts began his career in a bright manner, for to revenge the perfectly"
"justifiable death of their late captain he seized and razed the fort,"
"bombarded the town, and setting on fire two Portuguese ships so as to act"
"as torches, sailed away the same night. Sailing to Brazil they found in"
the Bay of Bahia a fleet of forty-two Portuguese ships ready laden and on
"the point of leaving for Lisbon, and Roberts, with the most astounding"
"boldness, sailed right in amongst them until he found the deepest laden,"
"which he attacked and boarded, although his was a much smaller ship. He"
"The temperature inside was a constant 5 degrees Celsius, kept just"
above freezing to extend the life of the sensitive electronic gear in
the next three bays. The high-voltage sodium lamps along the sides of
the fuselage now switched on automatically as the door swung inward. He
"fleetingly thought about turning them off, then realized they weren't"
manually operated.
Through the clouds of his condensing breath he could see that the
"interior of the entry bay was a pale, military green. The color"
"definitely seemed appropriate, given what he now knew about this"
vehicle.
"He quickly turned and, after making sure the outer door could be"
"reopened from the inside, closed it behind him. When it clicked secure,"
the sodium lights automatically shut off with a faint hum.
"Just like a damned refrigerator, he thought."
But the dark was what he wanted. He withdrew a small penlight from his
pocket and scanned the three bulkhead hatches leading to the forward
"bays. The portside bay, on the left, contained electronics for the"
"multimode phased array radar scanner in the nose, radar processors,"
"radar power supply, radar transmitters and receivers, Doppler"
"processor, shrouded scanner tracking mechanism, and an RF oscillator."
He knew; he'd checked the engineering diagrams.
"He also knew the starboard equipment bay, the one on the right,"
"contained signal processors for the inertial navigation system (INS),"
"the instrument landing system (ILS), the foreplane hydraulic actuator,"
"the structural mode control system (SMCS), station controller, and the"
pilot's liquid-oxygen tanks and evaporator.
"no longer to him, as to the man of the Middle Ages, as crystals mounted"
"in gold, or as stars in the firmament. 'I like assertions so little that"
I would easily take sides with the sceptics whereever it is allowed by
the inviolable authority of Holy Scripture and the decrees of the
Church.' 'What is exempt from error?' All subtle contentions of
theological speculation arise from a dangerous curiosity and lead to
impious audacity. What have all the great controversies about the
Trinity and the Virgin Mary profited? 'We have defined so much that
without danger to our salvation might have remained unknown or
undecided.... The essentials of our religion are peace and unanimity.
These can hardly exist unless we make definitions about as few points as
possible and leave many questions to individual judgement. Numerous
problems are now postponed till the oecumenical Council. It would be
much better to put off such questions till the time when the glass shall
"be removed and the darkness cleared away, and we shall see God face to"
face.'
'There are sanctuaries in the sacred studies which God has not willed
"that we should probe, and if we try to penetrate there, we grope in ever"
"deeper darkness the farther we proceed, so that we recognize, in this"
"manner, too, the inscrutable majesty of divine wisdom and the imbecility"
of human understanding.'
CHAPTER XIV
ERASMUS'S CHARACTER
Erasmus's character: Need of purity and cleanliness--
"Delicacy--Dislike of contention, need of concord and"
1517-18
"Erasmus at Louvain, 1517--He expects the renovation of the"
Church as the fruit of good learning--Controversy with Lefèvre
"d'Étaples--Second journey to Basle, 1518--He revises the edition"
"of the New Testament--Controversies with Latomus, Briard and"
Lee--Erasmus regards the opposition of conservative theology
merely as a conspiracy against good learning
When Erasmus established himself at Louvain in the summer of 1517 he had
"a vague presentiment that great changes were at hand. 'I fear', he"
"writes in September, 'that a great subversion of affairs is being"
"brought about here, if God's favour and the piety and wisdom of princes"
do not concern themselves about human matters.' But the forms which that
great change would assume he did not in the least realize.
He regarded his removal as merely temporary. It was only to last 'till
"we shall have seen which place of residence is best fit for old age,"
which is already knocking'. There is something pathetic in the man who
"desires nothing but quiet and liberty, and who through his own"
"restlessness, and his inability not to concern himself about other"
"people, never found a really fixed abode or true independence. Erasmus"
"is one of those people who always seem to say: tomorrow, tomorrow! I"
"must first deal with this, and then ... As soon as he shall be ready"
with the new edition of the New Testament and shall have extricated
"himself from troublesome and disagreeable theological controversies, in"
"which he finds himself entangled against his wish, he will sleep, hide"
"himself, 'sing for himself and the Muses'. But that time never came."
"Where to live when he shall be free? Spain, to which Cardinal Ximenes"
"called him, did not appeal to him. From Germany, he says, the stoves and"
"because the war with Spain ""threw open to her attack the whole"
"boundless possessions of her antagonist in the New World, which"
would have been closed to her in peace. By conquest she made for
"herself an empire, and this empire made her rich."" In the first"
place it was not in the New World that she mainly sought her
"empire, but in the East Indies, in the sphere of the Portuguese"
"conquests. Her hold of Brazil lasted only from 1621 to 1654, and"
"was not a great source of wealth, though she captured much Spanish"
"and Portuguese shipping. But even her eastern trade was, as we have"
"seen, small in quantity, and as a source of wealth was not to be"
compared with the herring fishery. In 1601 John Keymor declared
"that more wealth was produced by the northern fisheries ""in one"
"year than the King of Spain hath in four years out of the Indies"""
(_Observations made upon the Dutch Fishing about the Year
"1601_--reprint in _Phoenix_, 1707, i, 225). The Dutch takings in"
"six months' fishing were then reckoned at 3,600,000 barrels, valued"
at as many pounds sterling (_id._ p. 224); the fishing fleet
"numbered 4,100 sail of all kinds, with over 3,000 tenders, out of a"
"roughly estimated total of 20,000; while the whole Indian fleet is"
"stated at only 40 or 50, employing 5,000 or 6,000 men (_id._ p."
"223), as against a total of some 200,000 of Dutch seafaring"
"population. Howell, writing in 1622 (ed. Bennett, 1891, vol. i,"
"205), also puts the Amsterdam ships in the Indian trade at 40."
Professor Seeley's statement cannot have proceeded on any
comparison of the European Dutch trade with the revenue from the
"conquered ""empire."" It stands for an endorsement of the vulgar"
"delusion that ""possessions"" are the great sources of a nation's"
"wealth, though Seeley elsewhere (p. 294) protests against the"
"""bombastic language of this school,"" and notes that ""England is"
"not, directly at least, any the richer"" for her connection with her"
"""dependencies."""
"Europe, we had seen crowns which far surpassed this one in costliness"
"and beauty, but none of which, nor all of which combined, had ever"
excited a thousandth part of the interest attaching to this old crown
in Monza.
[Sidenote: Why the Crown is so Sacred.]
The explanation is this: within that ring of jointed plates of gold
"runs a thin band of iron, which priestly tradition says was made of one"
of the spikes that fastened the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ to the
"cross. It was this band of iron that we tiptoed to see, hardly noticing"
the bejewelled rim of gold around it. It was on account of this band of
iron that the priest and his attendant swung their censer and performed
their ceremony as we entered. It was this band of iron that gave to the
crown its sacred place above the altar. It was for the safe keeping of
"this band of iron that the steel case, with its numerous locks, was"
"made. It was from this band of iron that the diadem received its name,"
the Iron Crown of Lombardy.
[Sidenote: How it was Used by Charlemagne and Napoleon.]
"And what were the historical uses of it, referred to above, which made"
it so much more interesting to us than the many other so-called nails
"of the true cross elsewhere? Well, this among others: on the last"
"Christmas day of the eighth century, while Charlemagne was kneeling"
"with uncovered head before the high altar of St. Peter's in Rome,"
"the Pope approached him from behind, and, placing the Iron Crown of"
"Lombardy on his head, hailed him as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire."
"A thousand years later on the 26th of May, 1805, Napoleon Bonaparte,"
"""watched by an apparently invincible army which adored him and a world"
"which feared him,"" standing in the vast marble cathedral at Milan,"
The inhabitants of the street were divided into two parties according
"to their sympathies.  One was in favour of Kuvalda, who was thought ""a"
"good soldier, clever, and courageous,"" the other was convinced of the"
"fact that the teacher was ""superior"" to Kuvalda.  The latter's admirers"
"were those who were known to be drunkards, thieves, and murderers, for"
whom the road from beggary to prison was inevitable.  But those who
"respected the teacher were men who still had expectations, still hoped"
"for better things, who were eternally occupied with nothing, and who"
were nearly always hungry.
The nature of the teacher's and Kuvalda's relations towards the street
may be gathered from the following:
Once in the eating-house they were discussing the resolution passed by
"the Corporation regarding the main street, viz., that the inhabitants"
"were to fill up the pits and ditches in the street, and that neither"
manure nor the dead bodies of domestic animals should be used for the
"purpose, but only broken tiles, etc., from the ruins of other houses."
"""Where am I going to get these same broken tiles and bricks?  I could"
"not get sufficient bricks together to build a hen-house,"" plaintively"
"said Mokei Anisimoff, a man who hawked kalaches (a sort of white bread)"
which were baked by his wife.
"""Where can you get broken bricks and lime rubbish?  Take bags with you,"
and go and remove them from the Corporation buildings. They are so old
"that they are of no use to anyone, and you will thus be doing two good"
"deeds; firstly, by repairing the main street; and secondly, by adorning"
"the city with a new Corporation building."""
"""If you want horses get them from the Lord Mayor, and take his three"
"daughters, who seem quite fit for harness. Then destroy the house of"
plunder the palace from top to bottom and to give all within the
neighbouring town of San Ildefonso to the sword.
"The programme, as thus baldly announced, was indeed one to strike all"
"men with horror, even those who had been hardened by years of"
fratricidal warfare in which quarter was neither given nor expected.
"Besides the plunder of the palace and its occupants, the leaders of the"
gipsies expected that they would obtain great rewards from Don Carlos
for thus removing the only obstacles to his undisputed possession of the
throne of Spain.
The heart of Rollo beat violently. His Scottish birth and training gave
"him a natural reverence for the sanctity of sickness and death, and the"
"idea of these men plotting ghoulishly to utilise ""the onlaying of the"
"hand of Providence"" (as his father would have phrased it) for the"
"purposes of plunder and rapine, unspeakably revolted him."
"Immediately he called a council of war, at which, in spite of the frowns"
"of Sergeant Cardono, little Concha Cabezos had her place."
"La Giralda was summoned also, but excused herself saying, ""It is better"
"that I should not know what you intend to do. I am, after all, a"
"black-blooded Gitana, and might be tempted to reveal your secrets if I"
knew them. It is better therefore that I should not. Let me keep my own
"place as a servitor in your company, to cut the brushwood for your fire"
and to bring the water from the spring. In those things you will find me
"faithful. Trust the gipsy no further!"""
"Rollo, remembering her loyalty in the matter of Dolóres at the village"
"of El Sarria, was about to make an objection, but a significant gesture"
from the Sergeant restrained him in time.

Place.
She went to the Brussels bank a fortnight after her mother's death
whilst still availing herself of the hospitality of Madame
Trouessart: to withdraw the jewellery and plate which she had
deposited there on her mother's account. But there she found herself
"confronted with the red tape of the Latin which is more formidable,"
"even, than that of the land of Dora at the present day. These"
deposited articles were held on the order of Mrs. Warren; they could
not be given up till her will was proved and letters of
administration had been granted. So _that_ small resource in funds
"was withheld, at any rate till some time after peace had been"
declared. However she had a thousand pounds (in notes) between her
"and penury, and the friendship of Minna von Stachelberg. She would"
resume her evening lessons in English--Madame Trouessart had found
her several pupils--and she would lodge--as they kindly invited her
to do--with the Baptist pastor and his wife in the Rue Haute. And
"she would help Minna at the hospital, and hope to be rewarded with"
the opportunity of bringing comfort and consolation to the wounded
British prisoners.
"Thus, with no unbearable misery, she passed the year 1916. There"
"were short commons in the way of food, and the cold was sometimes"
cruel. But Madame Walcker was a wonderful cook and could make soup
"from a sausage skewer, and heaped _édredons_ on Vivie's bed. Vivie"
sighed a little over the Blue Placards which announced endless
German victories by land and sea; and she gasped over the dreadful
Red Placards with their lists of victims sentenced to death by the
military courts. She ground her teeth over the announcement of
"Gabrielle Petit's condemnation, and behind the shut door of Minna's"
small sitting-room--and she only shut the door not to compromise

"It may do very well for a Frenchman to call it that, but we must call"
it a perfect volcano of water. A huge column goes hissing up as high as
"a steeple, with the speed and force of a rocket, and comes down in"
"thunder, and little rainbows are flitting about in the showery spray."
"It being Sunday, every thing and person is gayer than usual. Bands are"
"playing and soldiers are parading all through the town; everything,"
"indeed, is military, and yet little is foppish--a statement which to"
English ears will sound like a direct contradiction.'
Our traveller had been given letters to certain Berlin Professors from
"young Blackie, afterwards Professor of Greek in Edinburgh University,"
who had just translated Goethe's _Faust_ into the English tongue. 'I
went about half an hour ago to call upon a sort of Professor here to
whom I had a letter and a _Faust_ to present from Blackie--found him
"ill and confined to bed--was admitted, however, very well received, and"
shall call again when I think there is a chance of his being better. I
have still another Professor to call on with a letter and book from
"Blackie, and there my acquaintance with the society of Berlin is likely"
to terminate.' One other introduction to Ferrier on this expedition to
"Germany is mentioned in a note from his aunt, Miss Susan Ferrier, the"
only letter to her nephew that has apparently been preserved: whether
"or not he availed himself of the offer, history does not record. It"
runs as follows:--
"'EDINR., _1st August_."
'I could not get a letter to Lord Corehouse's German sister
"(Countess Purgstall), as it seems she is in bad health, and not fit"
to entertain vagabonds; but I enclose a very kind one from my

"don't go there you may send it by post, as it will be welcome at"
other.
"A city watchman, with a pipe in his mouth, looked drowsily and frowsily"
out of the town-hall or _ayuntamiento_. He was retreating again to his
settle when it suddenly struck him that this intruder had paid no duty
"upon her milk and firewood. True, he was not the functionary appointed"
"by law to receive the tax; but since he was on the spot, and for lack of"
"other constituted the representative of civic state, he felt he must"
undertake the duty.
"So, laying aside his pipe and seizing his halberd and cocked hat, he"
sallied grumblingly forth to intercept the bold contravener of municipal
"laws. But the active limbs of the old gipsy, the lightened udders of the"
"she-goats, and the ass with his meek nose pointed homeward, took the"
party out of the village gate before the man in authority could
over-take La Giralda.
"Soon, therefore, the roofs of San Ildefonso and the white palace again"
lay beneath her as the gipsy reascended by her track of the morning. So
long had she occupied in her various adventures that the evening shadows
were already lengthening when she returned to the corrie where the party
had spent in restful indolence the burden and heat of the day. The
"Sergeant had not yet arrived, and La Giralda delayed her story till he"
should give her leave to speak. For not even to the gipsies of the
Guadarrama was José Maria a greater personage than Sergeant Cardono to
La Giralda of Sevilla.
"In the mean time she busied herself, with Concha's help, in preparing"
"the evening meal, as quick upon her legs as if she had done nothing but"
lounge in the shade all day. It was almost sundown when the Sergeant
"came in, dropping unannounced over the precipice as if from the clouds."
"interior, as in Missouri and in Texas. Hence after earlier"
"Cambrian time the central land subsided, with much the same effect"
"as if the Mississippi valley were now to lower gradually, and the"
Gulf of Mexico to spread northward until it entered Lake Superior.
The Cambrian seas transgressed the central land and strewed far
and wide behind their advancing beaches the sediments of the later
Cambrian upon an eroded surface of pre-Cambrian rocks.
The succession of the Cambrian formations in North America records
many minor oscillations and varying conditions of physical
geography; yet on the whole it tells of widening seas and lowering
lands. Basal conglomerates and coarse sandstones which must have
"been laid near shore are succeeded by shaly sandstones, sandy"
"shales, and shales. Toward the top of the series heavy beds of"
"limestone, extending from the Blue Ridge to Missouri, speak of"
"clear water, and either of more distant shores or of neighboring"
lands which were worn or sunk so low that for the most part their
waste was carried to the sea in solution.
"In brief, the Cambrian was a period of submergence. It began with"
the larger part of North America emerged as great land masses. It
closed with most of the interior of the continental plateau
covered with a shallow sea.
THE LIFE OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD
It is now for the first time that we find preserved in the
offshore deposits of the Cambrian seas enough remains of animal
life to be properly called a fauna. Doubtless these remains are
"only the most fragmentary representation of the life of the time,"
for the Cambrian rocks are very old and have been widely
metamorphosed. Yet the five hundred and more species already
The text passes on to an enumeration of the case of an ewe giving birth to
more than two lambs. The 'official' interpretations are throughout
"unfavorable[49], and the priests were quite safe in their entries which"
"were purely arbitrary in these cases, since such multiple births never"
occurred. It is worth while to quote these interpretations as an
"illustration of the fanciful factor that, as already indicated, played a"
not insignificant part in the system unfolded.
"If an ewe gives birth to three (lambs), the prosperity of the country"
"will be annulled, but things will go well with the owner of the ewe,"
his stall will be enlarged.
"If an ewe gives birth to three fully developed (lambs), the dynasty"
"will meet with opposition, approach of an usurper, the country will"
be destroyed.
"If an ewe gives birth to four, the land will encounter hostility, the"
"produce of the land will be swept away, approach of an usurper,"
destruction in the land.
"If an ewe gives birth to four fully developed lambs, [locusts (?)]"
will come and [destroy] the country.
"If an ewe gives birth to four, approach of an usurper, the country"
will be destroyed.
"If an ewe gives birth to five, destruction will ravage the country,"
"the owner of the house will die, his stall will be destroyed."
"If an ewe gives birth to five, one with the head of a bull[50], one"
"with a lion-head, one with a jackal-head, one with a dog-head and one"
of periods when they became more numerous.
ECHINODERMS. This subkingdom comprises at present such familiar
"forms as the crinoid, the starfish, and the sea urchin. The"
structure of echinoderms is radiate. Their integument is hardened
with plates or particles of carbonate of lime.
"Of the free echinoderms, such as the starfish and the sea urchin,"
"the former has been found in the Cambrian rocks of Europe, but"
neither have so far been discovered in the strata of this period
in North America. The stemmed and lower division of the
"echinoderms was represented by a primitive type, the CYSTOID, so"
"called from its saclike form, A small globular or ovate ""calyx"" of"
"calcareous plates, with an aperture at the top for the mouth,"
"inclosed the body of the animal, and was attached to the sea"
bottom by a short flexible stalk consisting of disks of carbonate
of lime held together by a central ligament.
"ARTHOPODS. These segmented animals with ""jointed feet,"" as their"
"name suggests, may be divided in a general way into water"
breathers and air breathers. The first-named and lower division
"comprises the class of the CRUSTACEA,--arthropods protected by a"
"hard exterior skeleton, or ""crust,""--of which crabs, crayfish, and"
"lobsters are familiar examples. The higher division, that of the"
"air breathers, includes the following classes: spiders, scorpions,"
"centipedes, and insects."
"THE TRILOBITE. The aquatic arthropods, the Crustacea, culminated"
before the air breathers; and while none of the latter are found
"in the Cambrian, the former were the dominant life of the time in"
"numbers, in size, and in the variety of their forms. The leading"
"crustacean type is the TRILOBITE, which takes its name from the"
"hollow beneath Segovia. Others, breaking up into parties of from a dozen"
"to a hundred, had betaken themselves over the mountains in the direction"
of Madrid.
So the Queen-Regent and the handsome Señor Muñoz remained perforce at La
"Granja, for the two-fold reason that the palace of Madrid was reported"
"to be in the hands of a rebellious mob, and that the disbanding troops"
"had removed with them every sort and kind of conveyance, robbed the"
"stables of the horses, and plundered the military armoury of every"
useful weapon.
"They had not, however, meddled with the treasures of the palace, nor"
"offered any indignity to the Queen-Regent, or to any of the inmates of"
"La Granja. But as the Sergeant well knew, not thus would these be"
"treated by the roving bands of gipsies, who in a few hours would be"
"storming about the defenceless walls. No resource of oriental torture,"
no refinement of barbarity would be omitted to compel the Queen and her
consort to give up the treasures without which it was well known that
"they never travelled. Obviously, therefore, there was no time to be"
lost.
"They went swiftly round the angle of the palace, their feet making no"
sound on the clean delicious sward of those lawns which make the place
"such a marvel in the midst of tawny, dusty, burnt-up Spain. In a brief"
space the party arrived unnoted and unchecked under the wall of the
northern part.
"Lights still burnt in two or three windows on the second floor, though"
all was dark on the face which the palace turned towards the south and
the town of San Ildefonso.
"""These are the windows of the rooms occupied by my lady the"
distinguished; it was all a question of genius. The Educational Service
"ought to be regarded not as a profession, but as a calling. Some men"
"were born to be teachers. It was not a question of race, of course; in"
"order to have an efficient educational system, there must be an"
"efficient organisation, but this should not be allowed to become"
"fossilised, and thus stand in the way of healthy growth."
"83,639. In the Presidency College a young man fresh from an English"
university was at once appointed a Professor regardless of his lack of
"experience, whereas an Indian who passed in highest examination with"
honours in India was appointed as an Assistant Professor. This grounding
often made him more efficient as a teacher than the Professor recruited
"from England. There were now several Professors in the college, in the"
"Provincial Service, who were highly qualified, and who lectured to the"
highest classes with very great success.
"83,640. In the Physics Department he had under his direction several"
Assistants who were so well qualified that they were allowed to give
"lectures to several classes. These Assistants, after their experience at"
"the Presidency College, would be best fitted to become Professors in the"
mofussil at Colleges. He would like to see them promoted to the higher
service after they had had experience. But before he gave them the
"highest positions, he would make it compulsory for them to go to Europe."
"83,641. A proportion of Europeans in the service was needed, but only as"
experts and not as ordinary teachers. Only the very best men should be
"obtained from Europe, and for exceptional cases. The general educational"
"work should be done entirely by Indians, who understood the difficulties"
of the country much better than any outsider.
"83,642. He advocated the direct recruitment of Indians in India by the"
"local government in consultation with the Secretary of State, rather"
"pistol from his belt, looked carefully to the priming, and with the"
greatest coolness in the world pointed it at the misshapen brat.
"""Now listen,"" he said, ""you are old enough to know the meaning of words;"
I give you one minute to betake yourself to your own place and leave us
"alone! There is no contagion in a pistol bullet, my fine lad, but it is"
quite as deadly as any plague. So be off before a charge of powder
"catches you up!"""
"The sound of the angry voices had attracted La Giralda, who, looking up"
hastily from her task of building the fire beneath the gipsy tripod at
"which she and the Sergeant were cooking, advanced hastily with a long"
wand in her hand.
"The imp wheeled about as on a pivot, and positively appeared to shrink"
"into his clothing at the sight of her. He stood motionless, however,"
while La Giralda advanced threateningly towards him with the wand in her
hand as if for the purpose of castigation. As she approached he emitted
"a cry of purely animal terror, and hastily whipping his crutch under his"
"arm, betook himself, in a series of long hops, to a spot twenty yards"
higher up the bank. But La Giralda stopped him by a word or two spoken
"in an unknown tongue, harsh-sounding as Catalan, but curt and brief as a"
military order.
"The boy stood still and answered in the same speech, at first gruffly"
"and unwillingly, with downcast looks and his bare great toe scrabbling"
in the dust of the hillside.
"The dialogue lasted for some time, till at last with a scornful gesture"
"La Giralda released him, pointing to the upper edge of the _barranco_ as"
the place by which he was to disappear: the which he was now as eager to
"do, as he had formerly been insolently determined to remain."
"enlarged, the stall of the enemy will be diminished."
"If the outside of the right ear is destroyed, the land will yield to"
the enemy's land.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the cheek[58], the enemy"
"will prevail against the power of the king, the king will be without"
"counsellors, a ruler will not inhabit the land, or the son of the"
king of universal sway[59] will be king.
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the cheek, an enemy will be"
installed in the royal palace.
"If the right ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a"
"demon[60] in my land, or in the house of the man[61]."
"If the left ear of the foetus lies near the jaw, birth of a demon in"
"the enemy's land, or the land of the enemy will perish."
The guiding principle of the interpretation in these instances is the
natural association of the right as your side and the left with the
"enemy's side. A defect on the right side is unfavorable to you, i. e., to"
the king or to the country or to the individual in whose household the
"birth occurs, while the same defect on the left side is unfavorable to the"
"enemy and, therefore, favorable to you. The principle is quite"
consistently carried out even to the point that if the sign itself is
"favorable, it is only when it is found on the right side that it is"
"favorable to you, while its occurrence on the left side is favorable to"
the enemy.
"Defects of any kind appear to be unfavorable, whereas an excess of organs"
"and parts are in many instances favorable, though with a considerable"
"""Certainly I will!""--and Villiers, accepting her card, on which was"
"inscribed her own private name and address, shook hands once more, and"
bowed her courteously out. No sooner had the door closed upon her than
"he sprang upstairs, three steps at a time, and broke impetuously in"
"upon Alwyn, who, seated at a table covered with papers, looked up with"
a surprised smile at the abrupt fashion of his entrance. In a few
minutes he had disburdened himself of the whole story of the
"""Tiger-Lily's"" visit, telling it in a whimsical way of his own, much to"
"the amusement of his friend, who listened, pen in hand, with a"
"half-laughing, half-perplexed light in his fine, poetic eyes."
"""Now did I express the proper opinion?"" he demanded in conclusion. ""Was"
"I not right in thinking you would never consent to be interviewed?"""
"""Right? Why of course you were!""--responded Alwyn quickly. ""Can you"
imagine me calmly stating the details of my personal life and history
"to a strange woman, and allowing her to turn it into a half-guinea"
"article for some society journal! But, Villiers, what an extraordinary"
"state of things we are coming to, if the Press can actually condescend"
"to employ a sort of spy, or literary detective, to inquire into the"
private experience of each man or woman who comes honorably to the
"front!"""
"""Honorably or DIShonorably,--it doesn't matter which,""--said Villiers,"
"""That is just the worst of it. One day it is an author who is"
"'interviewed,' the next it is a murderer,--now a statesman,--then a"
"ballet dancer,--the same honor is paid to all who have won any distinct"
"notoriety. And what is so absurd is, that the reading million don't"
seem able to distinguish between 'notoriety' and 'fame.' The two things
"are so widely, utterly apart! Byron's reputation, for instance, was"
much more notoriety during his life than fame--while Keats had actually
DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY
"And lastly, what are our duties to our country? These are essentially to"
win honour for it and also win for it security and peace. As regards
"winning honour for our country, it is true that while India has offered"
from the earliest times welcome and hospitality to all peoples and
nationalities her children have been subjected to intolerable
humiliations in other countries even under the flag of our king.
There can be no question of the fundamental duty of every Indian to
stand up and uphold the honour of his country and strove for the removal
of wrong.
"The general task of redressing wrong is not a problem of India alone,"
but one in which the righteous men are interested the world over. For
"wrong cries for redress everywhere, in the clashings interests of the"
"rich and poor, between capital and labour, between those who hold the"
"power and those from whom it has been withheld,--in a word in the"
struggle of the Disinherited.
When any man is rendered unable to uphold his manhood and self-respect
and woman are deprived of the chivalrous protection and consideration of
"men and subjected to degradation, the general level of manhood or"
womanhood in the world is lowered. It then becomes an outrage to
humanity and a challenge to all men to safeguard the sacredness of our
common human nature.
What is the machinery which sets a going a world movement for the
redress of wrong? For this I need not cite instances from the history of
other countries but take one which is known to you and in which the
living actors are still among us. In the midst of the degradation of his
"circumstances mere nonsense--which it very likely was--and said so,"
"which betrayed inexperience, and Alicia Derosne asked what time it took"
place.
"""Eleven sharp,"" said the Governor, and returned to the account of the"
murder.
Time after time in the last few days Alicia had told herself that she
"could bear it no longer. At one moment she believed nothing, the next,"
nothing was too terrible for her to believe; now she would fly to
"Australia, or home, or anywhere out of New Lindsey; now a"
straightforward challenge to Medland alone would serve her turn.
Sometimes she felt as if she could put the whole thing on one side; five
minutes later found her pinning her whole life on the issue of it. Under
"her guarded face and calm demeanour, the storm of divided and"
"conflicting instincts and passions raged, and long solitary rambles"
became a necessary outlet for what she dared show to none. She shrank
"from seeing Medland, and yet longed to speak with him; she felt that to"
"mention the topic to him was impossible, and yet, if they met,"
"inevitable; that she would not have strength to face him, and yet could"
not let him go without clearing up the mystery. She told herself at one
"moment that she hardly knew him, at the next that between them nothing"
could be too secret for utterance.
What she hoped and feared befell her that morning. She went out for a
"walk in the Park, and before long she met the Premier, with his daughter"
and Norburn. The two last were laughing and talking--their quarrel was
"quite forgotten now--and Medland himself, she thought, looked as though"
his load of care were a little less heavy. The two men explained that
"they were on their way--a roundabout way, they confessed--to the"
"Council, and had seized the chance of some fresh air, while Daisy was"
"full of stories about yesterday's triumph, that left room only for a"
although the dream might be said to lend itself to such suggestions.
The idea of moral retribution and eternal punishment may also be present
in dreams. This may be illustrated by the dream of a lady who had an ill
"and restless girl companion sleeping with her, and was disturbed as well"
by a yelping and howling terrier outside. She had also lately heard that
a friend had brought over a python from Africa. 'I dreamed last night I
had a basket of cold squirming snakes beside me; they just touched me all
"over, but did not hurt; I felt mad with loathing and hate of them, and"
"the beasts would not kill me. That, I thought, was my eternal punishment"
for my sins.' In her waking moments the dreamer was not apprehensive of
"eternal punishment, and it may be in such a case that, as Freud suggests,"
an unfamiliar moral idea emerges in sleep in much the same way as an
unfamiliar or 'forgotten' fact may emerge.
"On the whole, it may be said that while the moral attitude of the dreaming"
"state is not usually identical with that of the waking state, there still"
nearly always is a moral attitude. It could not well be otherwise. Our
emotional states are intimately bound up with moral relationships; we
"could not display such highly emotional states as we experience in dreams,"
"with all their tragic accompaniments, in the absence of any sense of"
morality.

"WHEREIN ""FINGERLESS"" FRASER RETURNS"
"Big George had lost no time, and already the tow-boats were overboard,"
while a raft of timber was taking form alongside the ship. As soon as
"it was completed, it was loaded with crates and boxes and paraphernalia"
"of all sorts, then towed ashore as the tide served. Another took its"
"place, and another and another. All that night the torches flared and"
the decks drummed to a ceaseless activity. In the morning Boyd sent a
"squad of fishermen ashore to clear the ground for his buildings, and"
all day new rafts of lumber and material helped to increase the pile at
the water's edge.
"His early training as an engineer now stood him in good stead, for a"
thousand details demanded expert supervision; but he was as completely
at home at this work as was Big George in his own part of the
"undertaking, and it was not long before order began to emerge from what"
seemed a hopeless chaos. Never did men have more willing hands to do
their bidding than did he and George; and when a week later _The
"Juliet_, with Willis Marsh on board, came to anchor, the bunk-houses"
"were up and peopled, while the new site had become a beehive of"
activity.
"The mouth of the Kalvik River is several miles wide, yet it contains"
"but a small anchorage suitable for deep-draught ships, the rest of the"
harbor being underlaid with mud-bars and tide-flats over which none but
small boats may pass; and as the canneries are distributed up and down
"the stream for a considerable distance, it is necessary to transport"
all supplies to and from the ships by means of tugs and lighters. Owing
"to the narrowness of the channel, _The Juliet_ came to her moorings not"
“From the above one might conclude that cleanliness and modesty are not
"the rule among the Chocos. As a matter of fact, the first thing they do"
"in the morning is to jump into the near-by river, and these ablutions"
are repeated several times in the course of the day.
"“The kitchen utensils are always thoroughly washed before using, and,"
"contrary to our former experience, their simple dishes, prepared mostly"
"in our presence, looked almost always inviting. During our stay among"
these good people nothing was noticed that would hurt the most delicate
sense of decency.
"“The Chocoes seem to be exclusively monogamist, and both parents"
"surround their babies with tender care, being mindful, however, to"
prepare them early for the hard and struggling life ahead of them.
"Small bows and arrows, dexterously handled by tiny hands, are the"
"favorite toys of the boys, while the girls spend more time in the water"
"playing with miniature dugouts, washing, and swimming. The only dolls"
"seen among them were imported ones, and they seemed to be as much in"
favor among grown women as among children. These latter go naked until
"they are about five years old, when the girls receive a large"
"handkerchief to be used as a ‘paruma’, or skirt, and the boys a strip of"
some old maternal dress for an ‘antia’ or clout.
"“The Chocoes are very industrious. During the dry spells their life, of"
"course, is an out-of-door one, planting and watching their crops,"
"hunting, fishing and canoeing. But when the heavy rains come they stay"
"at home, weaving baskets of all kinds--a work in which the women are"
"proficient--making ropes and hammocks, carving dishes, mortars, stools,"
and other objects out of tree trunks”.

been assigned to their seats by the gentlemanly conductor. The sidewalk
"was blockaded with sightseers who had gathered to stare at sightseers,"
justifying the natural law that every creature on earth is preyed upon
by some other creature.
The megaphone man raised his instrument of torture; the inside of the
great automobile began to thump and throb like the heart of a coffee
drinker. The top-riders nervously clung to the seats; the old lady from
"Valparaiso, Indiana, shrieked to be put ashore. But, before a wheel"
"turns, listen to a brief preamble through the cardiaphone, which shall"
point out to you an object of interest on life’s sightseeing tour.
Swift and comprehensive is the recognition of white man for white man
in African wilds; instant and sure is the spiritual greeting between
mother and babe; unhesitatingly do master and dog commune across the
slight gulf between animal and man; immeasurably quick and sapient are
the brief messages between one and one’s beloved. But all these
instances set forth only slow and groping interchange of sympathy and
thought beside one other instance which the Rubberneck coach shall
disclose. You shall learn (if you have not learned already) what two
beings of all earth’s living inhabitants most quickly look into each
other’s hearts and souls when they meet face to face.

CHAPTER XIV
THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD
WHAT A FORMATION RECORDS. We have already learned that each
"individual body of stratified rock, or formation, constitutes a"
record of the time when it was laid. The structure and the
character of the sediments of each formation tell whether the area
was land or sea at the time when they were spread; and if the
"former, whether the land was river plain, or lake bed, or was"
"covered with wind-blown sands, or by the deposits of an ice sheet."
"If the sediments are marine, we may know also whether they were"
"laid in shoal water near the shore or in deeper water out at sea,"
"and whether during a period of emergence, or during a period of"
subsidence when the sea transgressed the land. By the same means
each formation records the stage in the cycle of erosion of the
land mass from which its sediments were derived. An unconformity
between two marine formations records the fact that between the
periods when they were deposited in the sea the area emerged as
land and suffered erosion. The attitude and structure of the
"strata tell also of the foldings and fractures, the deformation"
"and the metamorphism, which they have suffered; and the igneous"
rocks associated with them as lava flows and igneous intrusions
add other details to the story. Each formation is thus a separate
"local chapter in the geological history of the earth, and its"
strata are its leaves. It contains an authentic record of the
physical conditions--the geography--of the time and place when and
where its sediments were laid.
PAST CYCLES OF EROSION. These chapters in the history of the
"legend in the same style as the one current in novels, which tells"
us that the aristocrats of old families close their doors to rich
"Americans, or like that other story Mrs. Marchmont was talking to us of,"
about the Jewish ladies who were crazy to become Catholics.”
"“I don’t see what you are trying to prove by all this,” said Laura."
“I am trying to prove that all there is underneath distinguished society
"is money, for which reason it doesn’t matter if it is destroyed. The"
"cleverest and finest man, if he has no money, will die of hunger in a"
"corner. Smart society, which thinks itself superior, will never receive"
"him, because being really superior and intelligent is of no value on"
"the market. On the other hand, when it is a question of some very rich"
"brute, he will succeed in being accepted and fêted by the aristocrats,"
"because money has a real value, a quotable value, or I’d better say, it"
is the only thing that has a quotable value.”
“What you are saying isn’t true. A man doesn’t go with the best people
merely because he is rich.”
"“No, certainly; not immediately. There is a preparatory process. He"
"begins by robbing people in some miserable little shop, and feels"
"himself democratic. Then he robs in a bank, and at that period he feels"
that he is a Liberal and begins to experience vaguely aristocratic
"ideas. If business goes splendidly, the aristocratic ideas get"
crystallized. Then he can come to Rome and go into ecstasies over
"all the humbugs of Catholicism; and after that, one is authorized to"
"acknowledge that the religion of our fathers is a beautiful religion,"
"and one finishes by giving a tip to the Pope, and another to Cardinal"
"Verry, so that they will make him Prince of the Ecumenical Council or"
Marquis of the Holy Crusade.”
"It was vital to stop this lying but insidious propaganda, and the"
first step was to prevent German agents from entering India at all.
To do this the nomad tribes of the Sarhad must be brought back into
line with their old policy of friendship with Britain. Hence my
orders from General Kirkpatrick.
He instructed me to proceed without a moment's unnecessary delay to
"Quetta, where I was to receive more detailed instructions."
"On leaving him I hurried, with car and native chauffeur, to the"
"railway station, and asked for a truck on which to place the car"
for entrainment to Nushki. The station-master assured me I was
"asking for an impossibility. A great Maharajah, then travelling, had"
"commandeered every available truck for his suite, luggage and cars."
I told him that the Government business on which I had been sent was
"all important, and, by a little persuasion, soon had myself on the"
way to Pindi and the car on the way to Nushki.
Arrived at Pindi I found I had exactly one hour left in which to
"catch the train for Quetta. There was no time to pack, sort out kit,"
"or decide what should, or should not, be taken on a campaign which"
"might last only a few weeks or many months, and which might assume"
"a political aspect sooner than expected. My servant, Allah-dad, was"
therefore directed to take everything for sorting out when time could
"be spared, and I rushed off to try and ""do a deal"" with General Sir"
"Gerald Kitson, before starting."
I realised that a motor-car might play an important part in this
"prospective campaign, as it would be necessary to travel for long"
"distances in a land of no railways and no regular roads, the best"
road to be hoped for probably being a sandy track used by camel
caravans. I had already had some experience of difficult motoring
"there is a transposition of ""second"" and ""third"" groups, which the"
"context corrects.) Motley, an inveterate Celtophobe, is at pains to make"
"out that the Walloons rebelled first and were first reconciled to Rome,"
"""exactly like their Celtic ancestors, fifteen centuries earlier."" He"
omits to comment on the fact that it was only the French form of
"Protestantism, that of Calvin, that became viable in the Netherlands at"
"all, or on the fact that indecent Anabaptism flourished mainly in"
Friesland; though he admits that the Lutheran movement left all
"religious rights in the hands of the princes, the people having to"
"follow the creed of their rulers. The ""racial"" explanation is mere"
"obscurantism, here as always. The Walloons of South Flanders were first"
affected simply because they were first in touch with Huguenotism. That
they were never converted in large numbers to Protestantism is later
"admitted by Motley himself (p. 797), who thereupon speaks of the"
"""intense attachment to the Roman ceremonial which distinguished the"
"Walloon population."" Thus his earlier statement that they had rebelled"
"against ""papal Rome"" is admittedly false. They had rebelled simply"
against the Spanish tyranny. Yet the false statement is left
standing--one more illustration of the havoc that may be worked in a
"historian's intelligence by a prejudice. (For other instances see, in"
"the author's volume _The Saxon and the Celt_, the chapters dealing with"
Mommsen and Burton.)
It was the Teutonic-speaking city populations of North Flanders and
Brabant who became Protestants in mass after the troubles had begun
"(Motley, p. 798). When the Walloon provinces withdrew from the"
"combination against Spain, the cities of Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and"
Ypres joined the Dutch Union of Utrecht. They were one and all reduced
"by the skill and power of Alexander of Parma, who thereupon abolished"
the freedom of Protestant worship. The Protestants fled in thousands to
"England and the Dutch provinces, the remaining population, albeit mostly"
"Teutonic, becoming Catholic. At this moment one-and-a-half of the"
The thoughtful traveler will concede to the Republic of Panama great
natural resources and a most happy entrance to the family of nations. It
is the especial protégé of the United States and under the watchful care
"of its patron will be free from the apprehension of misuse, revolution"
or invasion from without which has kept other Central American
governments in a constant state of unrest. About the international
morality of the proceedings which created the relations now existing
between the United States and Panama perhaps the least said the better.
"But even if we reprobate the sale of Joseph by his brethren, in the"
"scripture story, we must at least admit that he did better in Egypt than"
in his father’s house and that the protection and favor of the mighty
"Pharaoh was of the highest advantage to him, and in time to his"
unnatural brethren as well.
[Illustration: WORK OF INDIAN STUDENTS IN THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE]
"At present the Republic suffers not only from its own checkered past,"
but from the varied failings of its neighbors. Its monetary system
"affords one illustration. The highest coin of the land is the peso, a"
piece the size of our silver dollar but circulating at a value of fifty
cents. If a man should want to pay a debt of $500 he would have to
deliver 1000 pesos unless he was possessed of a bank account and could
settle by check. No paper money is issued. “Who would take paper money
issued by a Central American republic?” ask the knowing ones scornfully
when you inquire about this seeming lack in the monetary system. Yet the
"Republic of Panama is the most solvent of nations, having no national"
debt and with money in bank.

Perhaps it may be as well to turn aside from the orderly and informative
discussion of the statistics of the Zone to expand a little further here
upon the remarkable matrimonial phenomena it presented in its halcyon
"days--for it must be remembered that even as I am writing, that society,"
"which I found so hospitable and so admirable, has begun to disintegrate."
"Marriage, it must be admitted, is a somewhat cosmopolitan passion. It"
attacks spiggotty and gringo alike. In an earlier chapter I have
described how the low cost of living enabled Miguel of the Chagres
country to set up a home of his own. Let us consider how the benevolent
arrangements made by the Isthmian Canal Commission impelled a typical
American boy to the same step.
Probably it was more a desire for experience and adventure than any idea
of increased financial returns that led young Jack Maxon to seek a job
in engineering on the Canal. Graduated from the engineering department
"of a State university, with two years or so of active experience in the"
"field, Jack was a fair type of young American--clean, wholesome,"
"healthy, technically trained, ambitious for his future but quite"
"solicitious about the pleasures of the present, as becomes a youth of"
twenty-three.
[Illustration: MAIN STREET AT GORGONA]
The job he obtained seemed at the outset quite ideal. In the States he
could earn about $225 a month. The day he took his number on the Canal
Zone he began to draw $250 a month. And that $250 was quite as good as
"$300 at home. To begin with he had no room-rent to pay, but was assigned"
"comfortable if not elegant quarters, which he shared with one other man;"
"carefully screened and protected from all insects by netting, lighted by"
"electricity, with a shower-bath handy and all janitor or chambermaid"
service free. Instead of a boarding-house table or a cheap city
"appeared before us in a vital form, nothing can really destroy it; it"
"is because things are often given in a blurred, faint light that they"
gradually fade out of our memory. A very keen scientist was deploring
"to me, on one occasion, the fact that stories were told so much in the"
"schools, to the detriment of science, for which she claimed the same"
indestructible element that I recognise in the best-told stories.
"Being very much interested in her point of view, I asked her to tell"
"me, looking back on her school days, what she could remember as"
standing out from other less clear information. After thinking some
"little time over the matter, she said with some embarrassment, but with"
a candour that did her much honour:
"“Well, now I come to think of it, it was the story of Cinderella.”"
"Now, I am not holding any brief for this story in particular. I think"
the reason it was remembered was because of the dramatic form in which
"it was presented to her, which fired her imagination and kept the"
memory alight. I quite realise that a scientific fact might also have
been easily remembered if it was presented in the form of a successful
chemical experiment: but this also has something of the dramatic appeal
and will be remembered on that account.
Sully says: “We cannot understand the fascination of a story for
"children save in remembering that for their young minds, quick to"
"imagine, and unversed in abstract reflection, words are not dead things"
"but _winged_, as the old Greeks called them.”[37]"
The Red Queen (in “Through the Looking-Glass”) was more psychological
than she knew when she made the memorable statement: “When once you've
"_said_ a thing that _fixes_ it, and you must take the consequences.”"
"In Curtin's Introduction to “Myths and Folk Tales of the Russians,” he"
very name of Elleray breathes of poetry and romance. Our father and
"mother had, of course, known it in its glorious prime, when our"
"grandfather, ""Christopher North,"" wrestled with dalesmen, strolled in"
his slippers with Wordsworth to Keswick (a distance of seventeen
"miles), and kept his ten-oared barge in the long drawing-room of"
"Elleray. In these days they had ""rich company,"" and the names of"
"Southey, Wordsworth, De Quincey, and Coleridge were to them familiar"
"household words. The cottage my mother was born in still stands,"
overshadowed by a giant sycamore.'
We can easily imagine the effect which society such as this would have
"on a young man's mind. But more than that, the friendship with the"
"attractive cousin, Margaret Wilson, developed into something warmer,"
"and an engagement was finally formed, which culminated in his marriage"
in 1837. Not many of James Ferrier's letters to his cousin during the
long engagement have been preserved; the few that are were written from
"Germany in 1834, the year in which he went to Heidelberg; they were"
"addressed to Thirlstane House, near Selkirk, where Miss Wilson was"
"residing, and they give a lively account of his adventures."
"The voyage from Leith to Rotterdam, judging from the first letter"
"written from Heidelberg, and dated August 1834, would appear to have"
begun in inauspicious fashion. Ferrier writes: 'I have just been here a
"week, and would have answered your letter sooner, had it not been that"
I wished to make myself tolerably well acquainted with the surrounding
"scenery before writing to you, and really the heat has been so"
"overwhelming that I have been impelled to take matters leisurely, and"
have not even yet been able to get through so much _view-hunting_ as I
should have wished. What I have seen I will endeavour to describe to
"you. This place itself is most delightful, and the country about it is"
"magnificent. But this, as a reviewer would say, _by way of"
"anticipation_. Have patience, and in the meantime let me take events in"
"""Come,--let us go!"" she said gently. ""We twain, made one in love and"

"Away in a sheltered mountainous retreat, apart from the louder clamor"
"of the world, the Poet and his heavenly companion dwell in peace"
"together. Their love, their wondrous happiness, no mortal language can"
"define,--for spiritual love perfected as far exceeds material passion"
as the steadfast glory of the sun outshines the nickering of an earthly
"taper. Few, very few, there are who recognize, or who attain, such"
"joy,--for men chiefly occupy themselves with the SEMBLANCES of things,"
and therefore fail to grasp all high realities. Perishable
"beauty,--perishable fame,--these are mere appearances; imperishable"

"imperishable Worth alone, the seeker must needs encounter Angels"

But for those whose pleasure it is to doubt and deny all spiritual life
"and being, the history of Theos Alwyn can be disposed of with much"
"languid ease and cold logic, as a foolish chimera scarce worth"
"narrating. Practically viewed, there is nothing wonderful in it, since"
it can all be traced to a powerful exertion of magnetic skill. Tranced
"into a dream bewilderment by the arts of the mystic Chaldean,"
"Heliobas,--tricked into visiting the Field of Ardath, what more likely"
"than that a real earth-born maiden, trained to her part, should have"
"met the dreamer there, and, with the secret aid of the hermit Elezar,"
continued his strange delusion? What more fitting as a sequel to the
"whole, than that the same maiden should have been sent to him again in"
"the great Rhine Cathedral, to complete the deception and satisfy his"
giving them their reddish tints.
LIFE OF THE DEVONIAN
PLANTS. The lands were probably clad with verdure during Silurian
"times, if not still earlier; for some rare remains of ferns and"
other lowly types of vegetation have been found in the strata of
that system. But it is in the Devonian that we discover for the
first time the remains of extensive and luxuriant forests. This
"rich flora reached its climax in the Carboniferous, and it will be"
more convenient to describe its varied types in the next chapter.
RHIZOCARPS. In the shales of the Devonian are found microscopic
spores of rhizocarps in such countless numbers that their weight
must be reckoned in hundreds of millions of tons. It would seem
"that these aquatic plants culminated in this period, and in widely"
distant portions of the earth swampy flats and shallow lagoons
"were filled with vegetation of this humble type, either growing"
from the bottom or floating free upon the surface. It is to the
resinous spores of the rhizocarps that the petroleum and natural
gas from Devonian rocks are largely due. The decomposition of the
"spores has made the shales highly bituminous, and the oil and gas"
have accumulated in the reservoirs of overlying porous sandstones.
INVERTEBRATES. We must pass over the ever-changing groups of the
invertebrates with the briefest notice. Chain corals became
"extinct at the close of the Silurian, but other corals were"
extremely common in the Devonian seas. At many places corals
"formed thin reefs, as at Louisville, Kentucky, where the hardness"
of the reef rock is one of the causes of the Falls of the Ohio.
"Sponges, echinoderms, brachiopods, and mollusks were abundant. The"
"The pulse rose to 120, and respiration to 26, and there was"
"pain, which was subdued by 1/3 grain of morphia, administered"
"subcutaneously. A fair amount of urine was passed, and the"
"bowels acted once, the motion containing blood."
On the second day after operation there was some improvement;
"the pulse still numbered 116, and the temperature was raised to"
"100°, but the belly moved fairly, and pain was moderate."
"Abundant foul-smelling, bile-stained discharge came from the"
wound when the plug was removed. Rectal feeding was
supplemented by small quantities of milk and soda by the mouth.
"The condition did not materially change, but on the fourth day"
it was evident that the suturing of the stomach wound had given
"way, and liquid food escaped readily when taken. The discharge"
remained bile-stained and very foul. No extension of
"inflammation to the general peritoneal cavity occurred, but it"
was evident that the patient was suffering from constitutional
"infection from the foul wound, the lower part of which opened"
up somewhat after the removal of the stitches on the seventh
day. The wound was irrigated three times daily with 1-300
"creolin lotion, but remained very foul. The man slowly lost"
"strength, although escape from the stomach considerably"
decreased. On the tenth day a sudden severe hæmorrhage
"occurred, presumably from a large branch of the coeliac axis."
"The bleeding was readily controlled by a plug, and did not"
"recur; but the patient rapidly sank, and died on the twelfth"
"day after the operation, and fourteen days after reception of"
the injury. No _post-mortem_ examination was made.
"2. _Wounds of the small intestine._--These were comparatively common,"
but offered little that was special either in their symptoms or the
depression on the stone wall by which we descend to the lower dungeon
"is shown as the spot against which St. Peter's head rested, though our"
guide had just told us that these stairs were not in existence then and
prisoners were let down into the dungeon through the hole in the middle
of the stone floor. Such trifling discrepancies do not seem to trouble
the average Italian mind.
St. Peter and St. Paul are said to have been bound in this prison for
"nine months to a pillar, which is shown here. ""A fountain of excellent"
water beneath the floor of the prison is attributed to the prayers
"of St. Peter, that he might have wherewith to baptize his gaolers,"
"Processus and Martinianus; but, unfortunately for this ecclesiastical"
"tradition, the fountain is described by Plutarch as having existed at"
"the time of Jugurtha's imprisonment"" here, long before the time of St."
Peter.
"Another miraculous spring, still flowing, is shown in the Church of SS."
Cosmo and Damiano as that which burst forth in answer to the prayers of
"Felix IV., that he might have water to baptize his disciples."
[Sidenote: What the Head of St. Paul Did.]
But the most interesting of all the miraculous springs in or around
"Rome are the three fountains, about two miles from the city, where the"
Apostle Paul was executed. When his head was severed from his body it
"bounded from the earth three times, crying out thrice, ""Jesus! Jesus!"
"Jesus!"" A fountain burst from the ground at each of the three spots"
"where the severed head struck. It is asserted, in proof of this origin"
"of the fountains, that the water of the first is still warm, of the"
"second tepid, and of the third cold, but we drank of them one after"
another without being able to detect any difference in temperature. The
apostle's head is shown in bas relief upon the three altars above the
"distance--hair up and teeth bared. The feeling is spontaneous,"
"unpredictable, and the usual result is fight."
"Up to this time she had not seen me, or even known of my insignificant"
"existence; but suddenly, as though it were a sally of banter whose blade"
"he parried in the nick of time, her laughter-bathed eyes darted past him"
and squarely met my own; her lips sobered into a half parted expression
"of interest and, some strange thought--perhaps unbidden--coming into her"
"mind, sent the blood surging to her cheeks. As quickly as this happened"
"it had gone, and again she seemed to be absorbing the attention of her"
_vis-à-vis_.
"Once, years ago in the Dolomites, I thoughtlessly struck my staff upon a"
"piece of rock when, lo, a wonderful tone arose therefrom. And the memory"
"of that rich, unbidden sound was re-awakened now as the contact of our"
glances stirred something which thrilled me with a maddening sense of
harmony. As an E string vibrates when another E is struck somewhere near
"to it, so my being vibrated with each tilt of her head, each movement of"
her lips. Yet however much I conjured the magnet of my will to make her
"look again, she successfully, if coquettishly, resisted."
The Spanish waiter came up softly to refill my glass; an attention I
"permitted, murmuring happily:"
"""Right, kiddo! Stay me with flagons, comfort me with champagne, for my"
"heart is faint with love!""--only Solomon didn't sing it quite like"
"that, the fickle old dog, nor did my waiter understand me, which was"
just as well.
Engrossed with watching her I saw a new look come into her face as she
quickly whispered something across the table. Her _vis-à-vis_ turned
"impatiently as a man approached them, who to my surprise was the yacht"
containing dark blood.
On the commencement of the third day the patient's expression
"was extremely anxious, and he was suffering great pain. Pulse"
"96, temperature 100°. Tongue moist, occasional vomiting, bowels"
open yesterday. Has taken fluid nourishment since injury. The
"abdomen moved with respiration, but was moderately distended,"
especially in the line of the transverse colon; it was
"tympanitic on percussion, there was no dulness in the flanks,"
and only moderate rigidity of the wall on palpation. Frothy
fluid stained with bile and fæcal in odour was escaping from
"the wound of exit, and the everted margins of the latter were"
bile-stained.
A vertical incision was carried downwards from the wound for 4
inches. A rugged furrow was found on the under surface of the
left lobe of the liver; the stomach was contracted and firmly
adherent by recent lymph to the under surface of the liver and
the diaphragm. The transverse colon was much distended. On
separating the stomach a slit wound was found at the lesser
"curvature, immediately to the right of the oesophagus. This"
wound was closed with some difficulty with two tiers of
"sutures; the cavity was mopped out, and then irrigated with"
boiled water; a plug was introduced along the line of the
"furrow in the liver, and the lower part of the abdominal"
incision closed.
"The patient stood the operation well, and was removed to his"
"tent; during the day, however, two thunder showers occurred"
"during each of which water, several inches if not a foot deep,"
rushed through the camp. After the second flood he was removed
"to the operating room, the only house we had, and slept there."
"President.  At the right of the head of the Republic, who was"
"distinguishable by his crimson sash, sat the Countess Tornelli, with the"
wife of the United States Ambassador on his left.  The President's
"wife--who wore a superb gown of corn-coloured miroir velvet, richly"
"embroidered and inlaid with Venetian lace, a veritable triumph of the"
"Rue de la Paix--had on her right the Papal Nuncio, Monsignor Lerenzelli,"
"the doyen of the Diplomatic Corps, while on her left was my Chief, Lord"
Barmouth.
"The seat next me was allotted to his daughter Sibyl, who looked charming"
"in rose chiffon.  During dinner she chatted merrily, describing a"
charity bazaar which she had attended that afternoon accompanied by her
"mother.  On the other side of her sat Count Berchtold, the secretary of"
"the Austrian Embassy, who was, I shrewdly suspected, one of her most"
"devoted admirers.  She was charming--a typical, smart English girl; and"
I think that I was proved to be an exception among men by reason of the
"fact that I did not flirt with her.  Indeed, we were excellent friends,"
and my long acquaintance with her gave me a prescriptive right to a kind
of brotherly solicitude for her welfare.  Times without number I had
"chaffed her about her little affairs of the heart, and as many times she"
had turned my criticisms against myself by her witty repartee.  She
could be exceedingly sarcastic when occasion required; but there had
"always been a perfect understanding between us, and no remark was ever"
distorted into an insult.
Dinner was followed by a brilliant reception.  The great Salon des
"Fetes, which only a year before was hung with funeral wreaths, owing to"
"the death of the previous President, resounded with that peculiar hum"
made up of all the intonations of conversation and discreet laughter
rolled together against the sustained buzzing of the orchestra a short
distance away.  The scene was one of glittering magnificence.  Everyone
knew everyone else.  Through the crowd of uniforms--which always give an
THE MEETING PLACE OF THE CAYUCAS]
"Once a week Miguel’s father went down to market at Matachin, and"
"sometimes the boy went along. The long, narrow cayuca was loaded with"
"oranges, bananas and yams, all covered with big banana leaves, and with"
Miguel in the bow and his father in the stern the voyage commenced.
"Going down stream was easy enough, and the canoists plied their paddles"
"idly, trusting chiefly to the current to carry them along. But coming"
"back would be the real work, then they would have to bend to their poles"
and push savagely to force the boat along. At places they would have to
"get overboard and fairly carry the boat through the swift, shallow"
rapids. But Miguel welcomed the work for it showed him the wonders of
"Matachin, where great iron machines rushed along like horses, drawing"
long trains of cars; where more people worked with shovels tending queer
machines than there were in ten towns like Cruces; where folk gave pesos
"for bananas and gave cloth, powder and shot, things to eat in cans, and"
rum in big bottles for the pesos again. It was an exciting place this
Matachin and made Miguel understand what the gringoes meant when they
"talked about New York, Chicago and other cities like it."
[Illustration: BANANA MARKET AT MATACHIN]
When he grew older Miguel worked awhile for the men who were digging
"away all this dirt, and earned enough to buy himself a machete and a gun"
and a few ornaments for a girl named Maria who lived in another hut near
the river. But what was the use of working in that mad way--picking up
"your shovel when a whistle blew and toiling away until it blew again,"
with a boss always scolding at you and ready with a kick if you tried to
"take a little siesta. The pesos once a week were good, that was true. If"
you worked long enough you might get enough to buy one of those boxes
"that made music, but _quien sabe?_ It might get broken anyway, and the"
but I find that if I continue to do this I shall have but little time
for anything else.
The very unexpected welcome which the book has received prompts me to
take this plan and means of replying to many who have honored me by
"writing me personal letters. First, permit me to thank those who have"
"written letters of praise and gratitude, and to say that, although I may"
"be unable to reply in a private letter, I am not indifferent to these"
"evidences of your interest, and am greatly helped in my work by your"
sympathy and encouragement. I have also received most courteous letters
"from various clergymen who, disagreeing with me, desire to convert me"
either by mail or personal (private) interviews.
"It is wholly impossible for me to grant these requests, since my time"
"and strength are demanded in other work, but I wish to say here what I"
"have written to several of my clerical correspondents, and desire to say"
to them all.
"Although I cannot enter into private correspondence with, nor grant"
"personal interviews to, such a number of your body, I am entirely"
willing to respond in a public way to any replies to my arguments which
come under the following conditions:
1. On page fourteen of the introduction to my book Col. Ingersoll says:
"""No human being can answer her arguments. There is no answer. All the"
priests in the world cannot explain away her objections. There is no
explanation. They should remain dumb unless they can show that the
"impossible is the probable, that slavery is better than freedom, that"
"polygamy is the friend of woman, that the innocent can justly suffer for"
"the guilty, and that to persecute for opinion's sake is an act of love"
"and worship."""
man had a hare to hunt; no one lacked irrefragable arguments to prove
what must happen; no one knew exactly what was going to happen. The
"elder men gathered round Puttock and Jewell, and listened to a"
demonstration that the Premier's public life was at an end; the younger
"rallied Coxon, whose premature stateliness sometimes invited this"
"treatment, dubbing him ""Kingmaker Coxon,"" and hilariously repudiating"
the idea that he did not enjoy the title. Captain Heseltine dropped in
about eleven; cross-questioning drew from him the news that
"communications had passed, informal communications, he insisted, from"
"the Governor to Sir Robert, as well as to the Premier."
"""In fact,"" he said, ""poor old Flemyng's cutting up and down all over"
"the place. Glad it's his night on duty."""
"Presently Mr. Flemyng himself appeared, clamorous for cigars and drink,"
"but mighty discreet and vexatiously reticent. Yes, he had taken a letter"
"to Medland; yes, and another to Perry; no, he had no idea what the"
missives were about. He believed Medland was to see the Governor
"to-morrow, but it was beyond him to conjecture the precise object of the"
"interview. Was it resignation or dissolution? Really, he knew no more"
"than that waiter--and so forth; very likely his ignorance was real, but"
he diffused an atmosphere of suppressed knowledge which whetted the
curiosity of his audience to the sharpest edge.
A messenger entered and delivered a note to Puttock and another to
"Coxon. The two compared their notes for a moment, and went out together."
"The arguments rose furiously again, some maintaining that Medland must"
"disappear altogether, others vehemently denying it, a third party"
preferring to await the disclosures at the inquest before committing
themselves to an opinion. An hour passed; the noise in the streets began
"to abate, and the clock of the Roman Catholic cathedral hard by struck"
"twelve. Captain Heseltine yawned, stretched, and rose to his feet."
"shrapnel, had perforated the arm, which the patient was sure was by his"
"side at the moment of injury, and the X-rays showed it to lie at the"
"bottom of the pleural cavity, where we assumed it had fallen. When,"
"however, the bullet was removed by Mr. Watson, he found that the fixed"
pain and tenderness had been the result of a fracture of a rib from the
"inner side, not involving loss of continuity; hence the actual"
"indication for the operation had been a delusive one, since the bullet"
"had not fallen, but expended its last force in injuring the rib. The"
"patient made an excellent recovery, and rejoined his regiment at the end"
of six weeks. I saw several cases in which the bullet was lodged in
either the lung or bones of the spine do well with no interference. The
great disadvantage of primary removal in inducing an artificial
pneumo-thorax and in laying open a hæmothorax is obvious.
"In case of lodgment of the bullet in the lung, bearing in mind the"
"infrequency of untoward symptoms, the latter should be watched for prior"
to interference.
The following cases illustrate some typical instances of wound of chest
accompanied by the development of hæmothorax:--
"[Illustration: TEMPERATURE CHART 3.--Primary Hæmothorax, with rise of"
"temperature. Secondary rise, with fresh effusion and pneumonia."
Spontaneous recovery. Case No. 154]
(154) _Severe hæmothorax. Spontaneous recovery._--Wounded at
"Modder River at a distance of 30 yards. _Entry_, at the"
junction of the left anterior axillary fold with the
"chest-wall; _exit_, immediately to the left of the seventh"
dorsal spinous process. The patient arrived at the Base with
"signs of an extensive hæmothorax, accompanied by a temperature"
"which reached 102° on the fourth day, and on the evening of the"
men. The light had not been abandoned; it had simply burned itself out.
It was a fortunate circumstance that very little shipping frequents
"these seas during the winter, or there would have been one or two"
"marine disasters, as the islands are often wrapped in fog."
It is surmised that one of the men ventured outside on to a rocky ledge
"in the early hours of the morning. According to the log, a vicious"
"storm was raging at the time, and probably in the darkness the man was"
"swept off his feet and carried into the sea. The second keeper on duty,"
"marvelling at the non-return of his assistant, evidently had roused his"
"other companion, and the two had instituted a search in the storm, only"
in turn to be caught by a wave and carried away.
"In Great Britain, since 1860, men only have been employed by the"
"Trinity House Brethren for the maintenance of the lights, but in"
the United States women still are engaged in this duty. Some of the
British lights have been controlled by one family through two or
three generations. It was only a few years ago that a Darling retired
"from the vigil on the Longstones of Farne Islands, the scene of Grace"
"Darling’s heroism, while for a century and a half one family kept the"
"South Foreland light faithfully. The Casquets light off Alderney, in"
"the Channel Islands, was maintained by one family, some of the children"
"spending the whole of their lives on the rock, son succeeding father at"
the post of duty.
"On the American coast, however, women are more extensively employed."
Seeing that many of the lights are burned in a low tower projecting
"from the dwelling-house, this circumstance may be readily understood,"
as the duties beyond the maintenance of the light are not exacting.
"One of the most notable instances, however, is the Point Pino light"
"at the entrance to Monterey Bay, on the Californian coast, the"
guardianship of which has been in feminine hands for the past thirty
irritable and oil is preferable to aloes. Don’t use during pregnancy;
"may cause abortion. For young foals or other animals, the gentler"
"purgative, such as linseed or castor oil should be used. The medical"
"value of aloes being large, it is impossible to enumerate all the"
diseases in which it is useful. Externally the tincture of aloes and
"myrrh is sometimes applied as a stimulant to wounds, and powdered aloes"
is mixed with plaster of paris in making splints for dogs to prevent
these animals from biting and tearing them off. Internally aloes should
"be combined with ginger, nux vomica and given in capsule or bolus."
ALUMEN--ALUM
"DERIVATION.--From alum slate, shale, schist, a native mixture of"
aluminum silicate and iron sulphide. This is roasted and exposed to the
"air, when the sulphur is oxidized into sulphuric acid and combined in"
part with aluminum and iron to form sulphates. The mass is lixiviated
"with water, and aluminum and iron sulphates together with sulphuric acid"
are recovered in solution. The solution is concentrated and to it is
added potassium chloride. The double sulphate of potassium and aluminum
"(alum) is formed, which crystallizes out on cooling, while potassium"
sulphate and ferric chloride remain as by-products. Alum is purified by
recrystallization.
"PROPERTIES.--Large, colorless, octahedral crystals, sometimes modified"
"by cubes or crystalline fragments; without odor, but having a sweetish"
and strongly astringent taste. On exposure to the air the crystals are
liable to absorb ammonia and acquire a whitish coating. Soluble in nine
"parts of water, insoluble in alcohol."
deeply agitated. The priests were rousing the people against the newly
decreed Civil Constitution of the Clergy; and one of these
disturbances endangered the life of Napoleon himself. He and his
brother Joseph chanced to pass by when one of the processions of
priests and devotees was exciting the pity and indignation of the
"townsfolk. The two brothers, who were now well known as partisans of"
"the Revolution, were threatened with violence, and were saved only by"
their own firm demeanour and the intervention of peacemakers.
"Then again, the concession of local self-government to the island, as"
"one of the Departments of France, revealed unexpected difficulties."
Bastia and Ajaccio struggled hard for the honour of being the official
"capital. Paoli favoured the claims of Bastia, thereby annoying the"
"champions of Ajaccio, among whom the Buonapartes were prominent. The"
"schism was widened by the dictatorial tone of Paoli, a demeanour which"
"ill became the chief of a civic force. In fact, it soon became"
apparent that Corsica was too small a sphere for natures so able and
masterful as those of Paoli and Napoleon Buonaparte.
The first meeting of these two men must have been a scene of deep
interest. It was on the fatal field of Ponte Nuovo. Napoleon doubtless
came there in the spirit of true hero-worship. But hero-worship which
"can stand the strain of actual converse is rare indeed, especially"
when the expectant devotee is endowed with keen insight and habits of
trenchant expression. One phrase has come down to us as a result of
the interview; but this phrase contains a volume of meaning. After
Paoli had explained the disposition of his troops against the French
"at Ponte Nuovo, Buonaparte drily remarked to his brother Joseph, ""The"
"result of these dispositions was what was inevitable."" [13]"
"For the present, Buonaparte and other Corsican democrats were closely"
"concerned with the delinquencies of the Comte de Buttafuoco, the"
The best proof that Erasmus had practically given up his hope to play a
conciliatory part may be found in what follows. In the summer of 1520
"the famous meeting between the three monarchs, Henry VIII, Francis I and"
"Charles V, took place at Calais. Erasmus was to go there in the train of"
his prince. How would such a congress of princes--where in peaceful
"conclave the interests of France, England, Spain, the German Empire, and"
"a considerable part of Italy, were represented together--have affected"
"Erasmus's imagination, if his ideal had remained unshaken! But there are"
"no traces of this. Erasmus was at Calais in July 1520, had some"
"conversation with Henry VIII there, and greeted More, but it does not"
appear that he attached any other importance to the journey than that of
"an opportunity, for the last time, to greet his English friends."
"It was awkward for Erasmus that just at this time, when the cause of"
"faith took so much harsher forms, his duties as counsellor to the"
"youthful Charles, now back from Spain to be crowned as emperor,"
circumscribed his liberty more than before. In the summer of 1520
"appeared, based on the incriminating material furnished by the Louvain"
"faculty, the papal bull declaring Luther to be a heretic, and, unless he"
"should speedily recant, excommunicating him. 'I fear the worst for the"
"unfortunate Luther,' Erasmus writes, 9 September 1520, 'so does"
"conspiracy rage everywhere, so are princes incensed with him on all"
"sides, and, most of all, Pope Leo. Would Luther had followed my advice"
and abstained from those hostile and seditious actions!... They will not
rest until they have quite subverted the study of languages and the good
learning.... Out of the hatred against these and the stupidity of monks
"did this tragedy first arise.... I do not meddle with it. For the rest,"
a bishopric is waiting for me if I choose to write against Luther.'
"Indeed, Erasmus had become, by virtue of his enormous celebrity, as"
"circumstances would have it, more and more a valuable asset in the great"
"the article which is sold under the name of sago in our groceries, but"
"is mealy, tough, and almost elastic. The natives consider it a great"
"delicacy, and bake it into little cakes, or boil it into dumplings."
The main fleet of the Dobuans started some time in the second half of
"March from their villages, and went first to the beach of Sarubwoyna,"
"where they held a ceremonial distribution of food, eguya'i, as it is"
"called in Dobu. Then, offering the pokala to Aturamo'a and Atu'a'ine,"
"they sailed by way of Sanaroa and Tewara, passing the tabooed rock"
"of Gurewaya to the Amphletts. The wind was light and changeable,"
weak S.W. breezes prevailing. The progress of this stage of the
journey must have been very slow. The natives must have spent a
"few nights on the intermediate islands and sandbanks, a few canoes'"
crews camping at one spot.
"At that time I had already succeeded in reaching the Amphletts, and"
"had been busy for two or three weeks doing ethnographic work, though"
"not very successfully; for, as I have already once or twice remarked,"
the natives here are very bad informants. I knew of course that the
"Dobuan fleet was soon to come, but as my experience had taught me to"
"mistrust native time-tables and fixtures of date, I did not expect"
"them to be punctual. In this, however, I was mistaken. On a Kula"
"expedition, when the dates are once fixed, the natives make real and"
strenuous efforts to keep to them. In the Amphletts the people were
"busy preparing for the expedition, because they had the intention of"
joining the Dobuans and proceeding with them to the Trobriands. A few
"canoes went to the mainland to fetch sago, pots were being mustered and"
"made ready for stowing away, canoes were overhauled. When the small"
"expedition returned from the mainland with sago, after a week or so,"
"a sagali (in Amphlettan: madare), that is, a ceremonial distribution"
"of food was held on the neighbouring island, Nabwageta."
"put by a ruler. The same would apply to a combination of signs, one of the"
"fundamental principles of divination being--once favorable, always"
favorable.
Among the birth-omen reports we have one containing a historical reference
of unusual interest[30].
'If the foetus is male and female--omen of Azag-Bau who ruled the
land. The king's country will be seized.
"If a foetus is male and female, without testicles, a son of the"
palace[31] will rule the land or will assert himself against the
king.'
"We must assume in this case that a monstrosity has been born, having"
partly male and partly female organs. The priest by way of interpretation
"notes a series of signs registered in the collections, all prognosticating"
"an abnormal state of affairs--a woman on the throne, captivity, seizure"
of the throne by an usurper and revolt. We frequently find in the
"collections several interpretations registered in this way,--a valuable"
indication of the manner in which these collections were compiled by the
priests from a variety of documents before them. The name of this female
"ruler, hitherto known only from this report and from a list of proper"
"names in which Azag-Bau occurred, has now turned up in an important list"
"of early dynasties ruling in the Euphratean Valley, discovered and"
"published by Scheil[32]. We may conclude, therefore, that at the time that"
"Azag-Bau sat on the throne or shortly before, such a monstrosity actually"
"came to light. As an unusual occurrence it presaged something unusual, and"
was naturally associated with the extraordinary circumstance of a woman
mounting the throne. Azag-Bau according to the newly discovered list is
the founder of a dynasty ruling in Erech as a centre and whose date
appears to be somewhere between 2800 and 3000 B. C.--possibly even
"short, people of all classes of society, to find their national and"
favorite devotions in it. As a matter of fact no other Anatolian god could
maintain his independence side by side with the deities of Pessinus.[24]
We do not know the internal development of the {61} Phrygian mysteries
sufficiently to give details of the addition of each individual part. But
we can prove that in the course of time certain religions were added to the
one that had been practised in the temple of the Palatine ever since the
republic.
"In the inscriptions of the fourth century, Attis bears the cognomen of"
_menotyrannus_. At that time this name was undoubtedly understood to mean
"""lord of the months,"" because Attis represented the sun who entered a new"
sign of the zodiac every month.[25] But that was not the original meaning
"of the term. ""_Mèn tyrannus_"" appears with quite a different meaning in"
"many inscriptions found in Asia Minor. _Tyrannos_ ([Greek: Turannos]),"
"""lord,"" is a word taken by the Greeks from the Lydian, and the honorable"
"title of ""tyrant"" was given to Mèn, an old barbarian divinity worshiped by"
all Phrygia and surrounding regions.[26] The Anatolian tribes from Caria to
the remotest mountains of Pontus worshiped a lunar god under that name who
"was supposed to rule not only the heavens but also the underworld, because"
the moon was frequently brought into connection with the somber kingdom of
the dead. The growth of plants and the increase of cattle and poultry were
"ascribed to his celestial influence, and the villagers invoked his"
protection for their farms and their district. They also placed their rural
burial grounds under the safeguard of this king of shadows. No god enjoyed
greater popularity in the country districts.
This powerful divinity penetrated into Greece at an early period. Among the
"mixed populations of the Ægean seaports, in the Piræus, at Rhodes, Delos"
"and Thasos, religious associations for his worship were {62} founded. In"
"Attica the presence of the cult can be traced back to the fourth century,"
"farm, a few slices of sausage, and a big cup of frothing chocolate"
topped with whipped cream. The scene that spread before her was
"idyllic, from a bucolic point of view. The beech woods of Tervueren"
shut out any horizon of town activity; black and white cows were
"being driven out to pasture, a flock of geese with necks raised"
"vertically waggled sedately along their own chosen path, a little"
disturbed and querulous over the arrival of a stranger; turkey hens
"and their half-grown poults and a swelling, strutting turkey cock, a"
peacock that had already lost nearly all his tail and therefore
"declined combat with the turkey and was, moreover, an isolated"
bachelor; guinea-fowls scratching and running about alternately; and
plump cocks and hens of mixed breed covered most of the ground in
"the adjacent farm yard and the turf of an apple orchard, where the"
fruit was already reddening under the August sun. Pigeons circled
against the sky with the distinct musical notes struck out by their
"wings, or cooed and cooed round the dove cots. The dairy women of"
the farm laughed and sang and called out to one another in Flemish
and Wallon rough chaff about their men-folk who were called to the
Colours. There was nothing suggestive here of any coming tragedy.
This was the morning of the 13th of August. For three more days
"Vivie lived deliriously, isolated from the world. She took new books"
"to the shade of the forest, and a rug on which she could repose, and"
"read there with avidity, read also all the newspapers her mother had"
"brought over from England, tried to master the events which had so"
rapidly and irresistibly plunged Europe into War. Were the Germans
"to blame, she asked herself? Of course they were, technically, in"
invading Belgium and in forcing this war on France. But were they
not being surrounded by a hostile Alliance? Was not this hostility
on the part of Servia towards Austria stimulated by Russia in order
to forestal the Central Powers by a Russian occupation of
Constantinople? Why should the Russian Empire be allowed to stretch
"had been caught in an ambuscade and many of them killed, although the"
Spaniards had at last turned and fled. The pirates killed most of their
"prisoners, but kept a few to be questioned by L'Ollonais so as to find"
some other way to the town. As he could get no information out of these
"men, the Frenchman drew his cutlass and with it cut open the breast of one"
"of the Spaniards, and pulling out his still beating heart he began to bite"
"and gnaw it with his teeth like a ravenous wolf, saying to the other"
"prisoners, ""I will serve you all alike, if you show me not another way."""
"Shortly after this, many of the buccaneers broke away from L'Ollonais and"
"sailed under the command of Moses van Vin, the second in command."
"L'Ollonais, in his big ship, sailed to the coast of Honduras, but ran his"
vessel on a sand-bank and lost her. While building a new but small craft
"on one of the Las Pertas Islands, they cultivated beans and other"
"vegetables, and also wheat, for which they baked bread in portable ovens"
which these French buccaneers carried about with them. It took them six
"months to build their long-boat, and when it was finished it would not"
carry more than half the number of buccaneers. Lots were drawn to settle
who should sail and who remain behind. L'Ollonais steered the boat towards
"Cartagena, but was caught by the Indians, as described by Esquemeling."
"""Here suddenly his ill-fortune assailed him, which of a long time had been"
"reserved for him as a punishment due to the multitude of horrible crimes,"
which in his licentious and wicked life he had committed. For God
"Almighty, the time of His divine justice being now already come, had"
appointed the Indians of Darien to be the instruments and executioners
"thereof."""
"These ""instruments of God,"" having caught L'Ollonais, tore him in pieces"
"alive, throwing his body limb by limb into the fire and his ashes into the"
"air, to the intent ""no trace nor memory might remain of such an infamous"
"inhuman creature."""
"was the pure voice of tragic sorrow. It is in the terrible moment when,"
"after the heroic strain of the sacrifice is over, Virginius realizes the"
"meaning of what he has done. Presumably wild with grief, he raves in"
language so startlingly akin to the ludicrous despairs of Pyramus and
"Thisbe that the modern reader, acquainted with the latter, is almost"
jarred into laughter.
"O cruel hands, O bloody knife, O man, what hast thou done?"
Thy daughter dear and only heir her vital end hath won.
"Come, fatal blade, make like despatch: come, Atropos: come, aid!"
"Strike home, thou careless arm, with speed; of death be not afraid."
"Of such eloquence we might truly say with Theseus, 'This passion, and"
"the death of a dear friend, would go near to make a man look sad.'"
"In 1562 Tragedy, as we have said, took refuge in an imitation of the"
Senecan stage: translations of Seneca's tragedies had begun to appear in
"1559. _The Tragedy of Ferrex and Porrex_, or _Gorboduc_, as it was"
"originally and is now most commonly named, marks a new departure for"
English drama. To understand this we ought perhaps to say something
"about the essential features of a Greek tragedy (Seneca's own model),"
and make a note of any special Senecan additions. What strikes one most
in reading a play of Aeschylus is the prominence given to a composite
and almost colourless character known as the Chorus (for though it
"consists of a body of persons, it speaks, for the most part, as one),"
"the absence of any effective action from the stage, the limited number"
"of actors, and the tendency of any speaker to expand his remarks into a"
"set speech of considerable length. This tendency, especially noticeable"
"in the Chorus, whose speeches commonly take the form of chants,"
"encouraged the faculty of generalizing philosophically, so that one is"
constantly treated to general reflections expressive rather of broad
wisdom and piety than of feelings directly and dramatically aroused;
publicity given to Indian affairs through the reports and hearings of a
"National Commission, would arouse the American people, and a brighter"
day for the Indian would certainly dawn.
"No matter what is said, the Commissioner must fight alone and"
single-handed with the members of Congress. His is a great
"responsibility. Both Mr. Leupp and Mr. Valentine, in conversations with"
"me, have admitted that the chief difficulty in handling the Indian"
problem is found in the word “politics”. The Commissioner is dependent
on Congress for his appropriations. He may be sustained or opposed by
"members of Congress, and the public will remain in ignorance. He may not"
appeal save to the Secretary of the Interior. He must keep in mind the
wishes of his political party. He will not admit political pressure when
"in office, but after leaving the Service, he may tell his story of"
"trouble with politicians, as Mr. Leupp has in his book. Mr. Valentine"
"could enlighten us further on “The Indian Office in Politics”, did he"
care to speak. A paid National Commission would be dominated by _no_
political party. Ten years’ service would enable it to become entirely
"familiar with the needs of the Indians, whereas the average"
"Commissioner, serving less than three years, barely becomes acquainted"
with the problem when he is succeeded by a new appointee.
I recommend to the earnest consideration of the American people the
"Commission idea, as the only means of salvation of the American Indian."
It will be said by critics that many of the tribes are making
satisfactory progress and need no Commission; that the present
"organization of the Indian Office is sufficient. This is partly true,"
"but a study of the table of statistics, and reference to the testimony"
"submitted in this book, establishes the sad fact, that the majority of"
the Indians must lose unless we make a radical change in our policy. It
is useless to blind our eyes to hard facts; and these are that we
"develop a certain area after painstaking labor, and then through unwise"
Destiny had already linked the fortunes of the young Napoleon
Buonaparte with those of France. After the downfall of Genoese rule in
"Corsica, France had taken over, for empty promises, the claims of the"
hard-pressed Italian republic to its troublesome island possession. It
"was a cheap and practical way of restoring, at least in the"
Mediterranean the shattered prestige of the French Bourbons. They had
previously intervened in Corsican affairs on the side of the Genoese.
Yet in 1764 Paoli appealed to Louis XV. for protection. It was
"granted, in the form of troops that proceeded quietly to occupy the"
"coast towns of the island under cover of friendly assurances. In 1768,"
"before the expiration of an informal truce, Marbeuf, the French"
"commander, commenced hostilities against the patriots[4]. In vain did"
Rousseau and many other champions of popular liberty protest against
this bartering away of insular freedom: in vain did Paoli rouse his
"compatriots to another and more unequal struggle, and seek to hold the"
"mountainous interior. Poor, badly equipped, rent by family feuds and"
"clan schisms, his followers were no match for the French troops; and"
"after the utter break-up of his forces Paoli fled to England, taking"
with him three hundred and forty of the most determined patriots. With
"these irreconcilables Charles Buonaparte did not cast in his lot, but"
accepted the pardon offered to those who should recognize the French
sway. With his wife and their little child Joseph he returned to
"Ajaccio; and there, shortly afterwards, Napoleon was born. As the"
"patriotic historian, Jacobi, has finely said, ""The Corsican people,"
"when exhausted by producing martyrs to the cause of liberty, produced"
"Napoleon Buonaparte[5]."""
"Seeing that Charles Buonaparte had been an ardent adherent of Paoli,"
his sudden change of front has exposed him to keen censure. He
certainly had not the grit of which heroes are made. His seems to have
"been an ill-balanced nature, soon buoyed up by enthusiasms, and as"
"though it contained a definitely evolved plot, sent barely a ripple over"
the surface of succeeding authorship. It represents the steadfastness of
the maiden Melibaea against the entreaties of her lover Calisto and the
"much more crafty, indeed almost successful, wiles of the procuress,"
"Celestine. True, the play is dull enough. But if dramatists had been"
"awake to their defects, the value of the new importation from a foreign"
"literature would have been noticed. The years passed, however, without"
"producing imitators, until some time in the years between 1544 and 1551"
"a Latin scholar, reading the plays of Plautus, decided to write a comedy"
"like them. Latin Comedies, both in the original tongue and in"
"translation, had appeared in England in previous years, but only as"
"strayed foreigners. Nicholas Udall, the head master of Eton School,"
"proposed a very different thing, namely, an English comedy which should"
rival in technique the comedies of the Latins. The result was _Ralph
Roister Doister_. He called it an Interlude. Posterity has given it the
title of 'the first regular English comedy'.
"Divided into five acts, with subordinate scenes, this play develops its"
story with deliberate calculated steps. Acts I and II are occupied by
Ralph's vain attempts to soften the heart of Dame Christian Custance by
"gifts and messages. In Act III come complications, double-dealings."
"Matthew Merrygreek plays Ralph false, tortures his love, misreads--by"
"the simple trick of mispunctuation--his letter to the Dame, and thus,"
"under a mask of friendship, sets him further than ever from success."
"Still deeper complexities appear with Act IV, for now arrives, with"
"greetings from Gawin Goodluck, long betrothed to Dame Custance, a"
"certain sea-captain, who, misled by Ralph's confident assurance,"
"misunderstands the relations between the Dame and him, suspects"
"disloyalty, and changes from friendliness to cold aloofness. This, by"
"vexing the lady, brings disaster upon Ralph, whose bold attempt, on the"
"suggestion of Merrygreek, to carry his love off by force is repulsed by"
that Dame's Amazonian band of maid-servants with scuttles and brooms. In
fountains. In the church which has been built over them we were shown
"the pillar to which he was bound, and the block of marble upon which"
"he was decapitated, and, in the vault of another church hard by, the"
prison in which he was placed just before his execution.
We could not help asking the priest who was our escort whether this
"extraordinary story was still believed. His answer was: ""Certainly!"
There is no reason whatever to doubt it. The facts have been handed
"down in an unbroken succession from eye-witnesses,"" a position which"
he proceeded to defend at length and with great warmth when one of our
party in particular manifested much slowness to believe.
[Sidenote: St. Paul's Use of Plautilla's Veil.]
"Furthermore, the opening of these three fountains was not the only"
miracle wrought by the apostle after his death. Mrs. Jameson says:
"""The legend of his death relates that a certain Roman matron named"
"Plautilla, one of the converts of S. Peter, placed herself on the road"
"by which S. Paul passed to his martyrdom, to behold him for the last"
time; and when she saw him she wept greatly and besought his blessing.
"The apostle then, seeing her faith, turned to her, and begged that she"
"would give him her veil to blind his eyes when he should be beheaded,"
promising to return it to her after his death. The attendants mocked
"at such a promise; but Plautilla, with a woman's faith and charity,"
"taking off her veil, presented it to him. After his martyrdom, S. Paul"
"appeared to her and restored the veil, stained with his blood. In the"
"ancient representations of the martyrdom of S. Paul, the legend of"
Plautilla is seldom omitted. In the picture by Giotto in the Sacristy
"of S. Peter's, Plautilla is seen on an eminence in the background,"
"receiving the veil from the hands of S. Paul, who appears in the"
"clouds above; the same representation, but little varied, is executed"
"in bas-relief on the bronze doors of St. Peter's."""
THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT
At the invitation of the President and the committee of the Faridpore
"Industrial Exhibition, Dr. J. C. Bose gave a lecture on the life of his"
"father, the late Babu Bhugwan Chunder Bose, who founded the Exhibition"
"at Faridpore, where he was the sub-divisional officer, 50 years ago. It"
"was published in the Modern Review for February 1917--volume xxi, p."
"221. In course of his address, said Dr. Bose:--"
"It is the obvious, the insistent, the blatant that often blinds us to"
"the essential. And in solving the mystery that underlies life, the"
"enlightenment will come not by the study of the complex man, but through"
"the simpler plant. It is the unsuspected forces, hidden to the eyes of"
"men,--the forces imprisoned in the soil and the stimuli of alternating"
flash of light and the gloomings of darkness these and many others will
be found to maintain the ceaseless activity which we know as the fulness
of throbbing life.
This is likewise true of the congeries of life which we call a society
or a nation. The energy which moves this great mass in ceaseless effort
"to realise some common aspiration, often has its origin in the unknown"
"solitudes of a village life. And thus the history of some efforts, not"
"forgotten, which emanated from Faridpore, may be found not unconnected"
with which India is now meeting her problems to-day. How did these
problems first dawn in the minds of some men who forecast themselves by
"half a century? How fared their hopes, how did their dreams become"
buried in oblivion? Where lies the secret of that potency which makes
"certain efforts apparently doomed to failure, rise renewed from beneath"
"the smouldering ashes? Are these dead failures, so utterly unrelated to"
some great success that we may acclaim to day? When we look deeper we
"shall find that this is not so, that as inevitable as in the sequence of"
"bloodiest persecution against the priests of Isis that they ever suffered,"
"in consequence of a scandalous affair in which a matron, a noble and some"
priests of Isis were implicated.
"All these police measures, however, were strangely ineffectual. The"
Egyptian worship was excluded from Rome and her immediate neighborhood in
"theory if not in fact, but the rest of the world remained open to its"
propaganda.[27]
With the beginning of the empire it slowly invaded the center and the north
"of Italy and spread into the provinces. Merchants, sailors, slaves,"
"artisans, Egyptian men of letters, even the discharged soldiers of the"
three legions cantoned in the valley of the Nile contributed to its
"diffusion. It entered Africa by way of Carthage, and the Danubian countries"
through the great emporium of Aquileia. The new province of Gaul was
invaded through the valley of the Rhone. At that period many Oriental
emigrants went to seek their fortunes in these new countries. Intimate
"relations existed between the cities of Arles and Alexandria, and we know"
"that a colony of Egyptian Greeks, established at Nimes by Augustus, took"
the gods of their native country thither.[28] At the beginning of our era
there set in that great movement of conversion that soon established the
worship of Isis and Serapis from the outskirts of the Sahara to the vallum
"of Britain, and from the mountains of Asturias to the mouths of the Danube."
The resistance still offered by the central power could not last much
longer. It was impossible to dam in this overflowing stream whose
thundering waves struck the {84} shaking walls of the _pomerium_ from every
side. The prestige of Alexandria seemed invincible. At that period the city
"was more beautiful, more learned, and better policed than Rome. She was the"
"model capital, a standard to which the Latins strove to rise. They"
"translated the works of the scholars of Alexandria, imitated her authors,"
invited her artists and copied her institutions. It is plain that they had
"""What is the counter-spell, sister,"" asked the wife of the one"
quartermaster.
"""Is it certain that no one is listening to us? It seemed to me as though"
"some one were smoking in the forward cabin."""
"""But you know we looked in every corner. They just forgot to let the"
"fire go out in the caboose, and that is why there's smoke,"" said the"
"quartermaster's wife, ""so tell away."""
"""If they buy three cords of birch-wood,"" said the witch,--""but it must"
"be full measure, and they must not bargain for it--and throw the first"
"cord into the water, billet by billet, when the first breaker strikes,"
"and the second cord, billet by billet, when the second breaker strikes,"
"and the third cord, billet by billet, when the third breaker strikes,"
"then it is all up with us!"""
"""Yes, that's true, sister, then it is all up with us! Then it is all up"
"with us!"" said the wives of the quartermasters; ""but there is no one who"
"knows it,"" they cried, and laughed loudly, and with that they flew out"
"of the hatchway, screaming and croaking like ravens."
"When it came time to sail, the cabin-boy would not go along for anything"
"in the world; and all the captain's coaxing, and all his promises were"
"useless, nothing would tempt him to go. At last they asked him whether"
"he were afraid, because fall was at hand, and said he would rather hide"
"behind the stove, hanging to mother's apron strings. No, said the youth,"
"he was not afraid, and they could not say that they had ever seen him"
show a sign of so land-lubberly a thing as fear; and he was willing to
"prove it to them, for now he was going along with them, but he made"
"it a condition that three cords of birch-wood were to be bought, full"
"measure, and that on a certain day he was to have command, just as"
with other nations with whom they want to live in peace. And they
realise any predominant interest of a foreign country in their trade or
manufacture is sure to lead to misunderstanding and friction. Actuated
by this idea they have practically excluded all foreign manufactured
articles by prohibitive tariffs.
REVIVAL OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES
Is our country slow to realise the danger that threatens her by the
capture of her market and the total destruction of her industries? Does
she not realise that it is helpless passivity that directly provokes
aggression? Has not the recent happenings in China served as an object
"lesson? There is, therefore, no time to be lost and the utmost effort is"
demanded of the Government and the people for the revival of our own
industries. The various attempts that have hitherto been made have not
been as successful as the necessity of the case demands. The efforts of
the Government and of the people have hitherto been spasmodic and often
worked at cross purposes. The Government should have an advisory body
of Indian members. There should be some modification of rules as regards
selection of Industrial scholars. Before being sent out to foreign
countries they should be made to study the conditions of manufacture in
this country and its difficulties. For a particular industry there
"should be a co-ordinated group of three scholars, two for the industrial"
and one for the commercial side. Difficulties would arise in adapting
foreign knowledge to Indian conditions. This can only be overcome by the
"devoted labour of men of originality, who have been trained in our"
future Research Laboratory. The Government could also materially help
(i) by offering facilities for the supply of raw materials (ii) by
offering expert advice (iii) by starting experimental industries. He had
reason to think that the Government is full alive to the crucial
importance of the subject and is determined to take every step
"All at once, moved by a sudden impulse, he turned toward the right hand"
"side of the altar, where the great statue of St. Christopher stands,"
and where one of the loveliest windows in the world gleams like a great
"carven gem aloft, filtering the light through a myriad marvellous"
"shades of color, and there he beheld, kneeling on the stone pavement,"
"one solitary worshipper,--a girl. Her hands were clasped, and her face"
"was bent upon them so that her features were not visible,--but the"
"radiance from the window fell on her uncovered golden hair, encircling"
"it with the glistening splendor of a heavenly nimbus,--and round her"
"slight, devotional figure, rays of azure and rose jasper and emerald,"
"flickered in wide and lustrous patterns, like the glow of the setting"
sun on a translucent sea. How very still she was! ... how fervently
absorbed in prayer!
"Vaguely startled, and thrilled by an electric, indefinable instinct,"
"Alwyn went toward her with hushed and reverential tread, his eyes"
"dwelling upon the drooping, delicate outline of her form with"
"fascinated and eager attention. She was clad in gray,--a soft, silken,"
"dove-like gray, that clung about her in picturesque, daintily draped"
"folds,--he approached her still more nearly, and then could scarcely"
refrain from a loud cry of amazement! What flowers were those she wore
"at her breast!--so white, so star-like, so suggestive of paradise"
lilies new-gathered? Were they not the flowers of ARDATH? Dizzy with
"the sudden tumult of his own emotions, he dropped on his knees beside"
"her,--she did not stir! Was she REAL?--or a phantom? Trembling"
"violently, he touched her garment--it was of tangible, smooth texture,"
"actual enough, if the sense of touch could be relied upon. In an agony"
"of excitement and suspense he lost all remembrance of time, place, or"
"custom,--her bewildering presence must be explained,--he must know who"
"she was,--he must speak to her,--speak, if he died for it!"
"""Pardon me!"" he whispered faintly, scarcely conscious of his own words;"
Her strange behavior at that time had affected him more deeply than he
would have thought possible; and while he had purposely avoided
"thinking much about the banker's sudden change of front, back of his"
"devout thankfulness for the miracle was a vague suspicion, a curious"
feeling that made him uncomfortable in the girl's presence. He could
"not repent his determination to win at any price; yet he shrank, with a"
"moral cowardice which made him inwardly writhe, from owning that Cherry"
had made the sacrifice at which Clyde and the others had hinted. If it
"were indeed true, it placed him in an intolerable position, wherein he"
could express neither his gratitude nor his censure. No doubt she had
"read the signs of his mental confusion, and her own delicate"
sensibility had responded to it.
They remained side by side on the bridge while the day died amidst a
"wondrous panoply of color, each busied with thoughts that might not be"
"spoken, in their hearts emotions oddly at variance. The sky ahead of"
"them was wide-streaked with gold, as if for a symbol, interlaid with"
sooty clouds in silhouette; on either side the mountains rose from
penumbral darkness to clear-cut heights still bright from the slanting
radiance. Here and there along the shadowy shore-line a light was born;
the smell of the salt sea was in the air. Above the rhythmic pulse of
"the steamer rose the voices of men singing between decks, while the"
parting waters at the prow played a soft accompaniment. A steward
"summoned them to supper, but Boyd refused, saying he could not eat, and"
the girl stayed with him while the miles slowly slipped past and the
night encompassed them.
"""Two hours more,"" he told her, as the ship's bell sounded. ""Then I can"
"eat and sleep--and sing."""
Captain Peasley was pacing the bridge when later they breasted the
mainly upon his fists. Blows were rained upon him from unguarded
"quarters, he was kicked, battered, and flung about, his blind instinct"
finally leading him to clinch with whomsoever his hands encountered.
"Then a sudden blackness swallowed him up, after which he found himself"
"upon his knees, his arms loosely encircling a pair of legs, and"
realized that he had been half-stunned by a blow from behind. The legs
"he was clutching tried to kick him loose, at which he summoned all his"
"strength, knowing that he must go down no further; but as he struggled"
"upward, something smote him in the side with sickening force, and he"
went to his knees again.
"Close beside him he saw the club he had dropped, and endeavored to"
"reach it; but before he could do so, a hand snatched it away and he"
"heard a voice cursing above him. A second time he tried to rise, but"
his shocked nerves failed to transmit the impulse to his muscles; he
could only raise his shoulder and fling an arm weakly above his head in
anticipation of the crushing blow he knew was coming. But it did not
"descend, Instead, he heard a gun shot--that sound for which his ears"
had been strained from the first--and then for an instant he wondered
"if it had been directed at himself. A weight sank across his calves,"
"the legs he had been holding broke away from his grasp; then, with a"
"final effort, he pulled himself free and staggered to his feet, his"
"head rocking, his knees sagging. He saw a man's figure facing him, and"
"lunged at it, to bring up in the arms of ""Fingerless"" Fraser, who cried"
sharply:
"""Are you hurt, Bo?"""
"Too dazed to answer, he turned and beheld the body of a man stretched"
"face downward on the floor. Beyond, the fellow in the gray suit was"
disappearing into the crowd. Even yet Boyd did not realize whence the
"shot had come, although the smell of powder was sharp in his nostrils."
"""Come, gezabo, let's court Dame Roulette! Join us, Jack?"""
"This I declined, and watched them move off arm in arm. But a strange"
"thing arrested my attention for, as they preceded down the corridor, I"
saw a man in yachting clothes--the uniform of a captain--draw quickly
back into an alcove as if wanting to escape discovery. When they had
"passed he looked out, more fearfully than curiously, and after a moment"
of indecision slowly followed them. Urged by a suspicion that this was
"in some way associated with the professor, I arose and also followed."
Yet upon reaching the salon the stranger was nowhere to be seen. Tommy
"and Monsieur were each buying a stack of chips, the place seemed quiet"
"and orderly, so without being observed I returned to my table."
"Now left alone I leaned back, idly twisting the stem of my glass,"
looking over the sea of merry people who made a picture that quickened
interest. For I am particularly fond of sitting apart and watching an
"assemblage of handsomely groomed men and women laughing, talking and"
making love. I like to guess whether fears or tears or desperate courage
hide behind their gayety; whether the rapidly wagging tongues are
uttering inanities or planning naughty things; whether the love-making
"will stop with coffee and liqueur, or, lighted by them, burn into"
eternity.
All phases of human banality and human enigma seemed to be represented.
There were languid beauties of the Latin type whose drooping eyes might
"have expressed _ennui_, passion, pride--anything, in fact, that one's"
"humor chose to fancy; the blonde by adoption was there, with heavy"
"ear-rings of jet, whose habit was that of looking slant-wise through her"
"cigarette smoke and raising one black, though carefully plucked,"
"eyebrow; also there were a few American women, by far the most smartly"
dressed. Great was the throb of life in this discreet and fashionable
But what shall we say of our president--Ingersoll? A man who in
ten short years has carried mental liberty into every household in
"America--who is without limitations in religion, and modifies justice by"
"no prefix. A man who, with unequaled oratory, champions Freedom--not the"
"""free, white, adult, male"" freedom of Washington. A man who has breasted"
"a whirlwind of detraction and abuse for Justice--not the ""male, adult"""
"justice of Lincoln, but the freedom and justice, without limitation, for"
"""man, woman, and child."""
"With such a leader, what should not be achieved? With such a champion,"
what cause could fail? If the people ever place such a man in the White
"House, the nations of this earth will know, for the first time, the real"
meaning of a free government under secular administration.
"""A government of the people, for the people, by the people,"" will be"
"more than simply a high-sounding phrase, which, read by the light of the"
"past, was only a bitter mockery to a race in chains; and, read by the"
"light of the present, is a choice bit of grim humor to half of a nation"
in petticoats. But so long as the taste of the voter is such that he
prefers to place in the executive chair a type of man so eminently
fitted for private life that when you want to find him you have to
"_shake the chair_ to see if he is in it, just so long will there be no"
danger that the lightning will strike so as to deprive the Freethinkers
of one man in America who could fill the national executive chair
"_full_, and strain the back and sides a little getting in."
"Once more I send greetings to the Convention, with the hope that you may"
"have as grand a time as you ought to have, and that Free thought will"
receive a new impulse from the harmony and enthusiasm of this meeting.
"Sincerely,"

Half-a-dozen problems of extreme national importance confront every
thinking English man and woman in 1907. The air is thick with their
"stir and movement, and so great is the noise and reverberation of them"
that true “royalty” of “_inward_ happiness” seems a thing impossible
"and past by in these troubled times. Be that as it may, it is quite"
certain that one of the most real and pressing of these problems is
that summed up in the stock phrase “Record Low Birth-rate.”
We hear a great deal about the doings of a class of people who are
"referred to as “The Smart Set,” and it is actually said that its"
influence is having a serious effect upon the national character. I do
not believe it for a moment. It seems a folly to suppose that a
handful of champagne corks floating on a cess-pool has any
far-reaching influence upon the English home. I mention that small
"section of society constituted by the idle and luxurious rich,"
"because, whatever their vices are, they are being used as whipping-boy"
for enormous numbers of people whose lives are equally guilty with
theirs in at least one regard--in the matter of which I am writing
now.
I propose in this essay to discuss the question of the decline in the
birth-rate from the Christian and Catholic standpoint. There is only
"one perfect philosophy, and all other half-true philosophies in the"
"light of which we might consider such a momentous matter as this, lead"
only to the conclusion that expediency is the highest good. Without
the incentive of the Christian Faith and without the light of the
Incarnation one may sit in a corner and think till “all’s blue in
cloud cuckoo land.” Christianity can alone be reconciled with
"Economics, theory and practice celebrating always the marriage of the"
"King’s son, the wedding of Heaven and Earth, the spiritual and the"
material. Plato knew that it was impossible to raise the Greek state
"to the level of his philosophic principles, and Aristotle frankly"
"attacks upon capital, and encouraged to believe that it is the priest"
who is his true foe. “_Le cléricalisme voilà l’ennemi_” is a
convenient cry. A vague Deism is not dangerous to wealthy
manufacturers; but if the clergy are going to take up Christian
Socialism it is time to be up and doing. So every weapon against the
"creed of Christendom is being taken down and examined, and many an old"
fallacy is refurbished and employed once more. Celsus is disinterred
"from the tomb in which Origen had buried him, and his filthy slander"
of the Blessed Virgin is printed as though it were a new discovery of
historical research. Collins is called into court again as though
"Bentley had never exposed his ignorance, and Hume’s _a priori_ method"
is revived as though it had never been discredited; whilst Strauss and
"Renan are quoted as authorities, as if Westcott and Lightfoot had"
never been known. Shunt the working classes on a new line of rails.
"Set them shrieking against sacramentalists, and swearing at"
"sacerdotalists, and we may quietly arrange our commercial combinations"
and protect our manufacturing interests!
I want to see the seats under the dome of St. Paul’s filled not by
"only the middle-aged middle classes, who for the most part are"
"Christian in creed, but by the young artisans and craftsmen, and the"
"strong politicians who fill the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, and"
crowd the great Assembly Rooms of Birmingham and Liverpool when an
election is drawing near. The timid members of the Episcopate who may
be reminded that “He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he
"that regardeth the clouds shall not reap,” are not our only Bishops."
Occasionally a Prime Minister offers for election and consecration a
man who can reach the minds and consciences of men. Is it too great an
ambition for a storyteller to try to arouse in people’s minds a
"suspicion that after all something may be said for the Catholic Faith,"
and so to bring them to listen to those who know and can teach it?
Each man must do his work with such tools as have come in his way. The
My fears were justified.
"At first the conversation was commonplace, and I related various"
experiences in a desultory fashion. Those that were mildly amusing were
most appreciated. But gradually we drifted towards more vital issues and
then the long and futile argument began. The weapons of sarcasm and
denunciation were denied to me by the laws of politeness and etiquette.
I beat in vain against the solid walls of obstinate prejudice and
superficiality. His statements were uttered with dogmatic emphasis. They
expressed beliefs held with all the self-assurance born of ignorance.
"They were based on no independent reasoning or observation, but had been"
assimilated either directly from the daily Press or from a circle of
acquaintances whose entire political outlook was the creation of the
Press. It was only then that I realized the immense power of newspapers.
"For most people ""thinking"" is just the discovery of convenient phrases"
"or labels, such as ""pessimist,"" or ""socialist,"" or ""pacifist"" or"
"""Bolshevik."" When any puzzling mental attitude comes before their"
"notice, they pin one of their labels to it, and, having labelled it,"
they think they understand it. The Press supplies them with these
"labels, and, consciously or unconsciously, they store them up in their"
minds and always have a few ready for immediate use.
So familiar and commonplace were the phrases which my opponent selected
"from his store in order to reply to my every utterance, that I could"
"almost tell what he was going to say before he said it. Moreover, the"
"fact that he had travelled abroad and had associated with foreigners,"
instead of widening his view had only narrowed it. Had he never
travelled he might have been sufficiently modest to admit that he knew
nothing of foreign countries and he might have suspended judgment about
them; but the mere fact that he had travelled filled him with a deep
sanguinary purification imparted by the taurobolium was more efficacious
than baptism. The food that was taken during the mystic feasts was likened
to the bread and wine of the communion; the Mother of the Gods was
"undoubtedly placed above the Mother of God, whose son also had risen again."
"A Christian author, writing at Rome about the year 375, furnishes some"
"remarkable information on this subject. As we have seen, a mournful"
"ceremony was celebrated on March 24th, the _dies sanguinis_ in the course"
of which the _galli_ shed their blood and sometimes mutilated themselves in
"commemoration of the wound that had caused Attis's death, ascribing an"
expiatory and atoning power to the blood thus shed. The pagans {71} claimed
that the church had copied their most sacred rites by placing her Holy Week
at the vernal equinox in commemoration of the sacrifice of the cross on
"which the divine Lamb, according to the church, had redeemed the human"
"race. Indignant at these blasphemous pretensions, St. Augustine tells of"
having known a priest of Cybele who kept saying: _Et ipse Pileatus
"christianus est_--""and even the god with the Phrygian cap [i. e., Attis] is"
"a Christian.""[42]"
But all efforts to maintain a barbarian religion stricken with moral
decadence were in vain. On the very spot on which the last taurobolia took
"place at the end of the fourth century, in the _Phrygianum_, stands to-day"
the basilica of the Vatican.
*       *       *       *       *
There is no Oriental religion whose progressive evolution we could follow
"at Rome so closely as the cult of Cybele and Attis, none that shows so"
plainly one of the reasons that caused their common decay and
"disappearance. They all dated back to a remote period of barbarism, and"
from that savage past they inherited a number of myths the odium of which
"could be masked but not eradicated by philosophical symbolism, and"
practices whose fundamental coarseness had survived from a period of rude
"advantage, was now slightly in advance."
The black stallion had just reached the downward dip leading to the deep
ditch filled with gorse bushes. His rider had had perforce to pull him
"up somewhat, lest he should slip and fall, for the ground was sandy and"
treacherous.  But Don Carlos had been born and bred to this sort of wild
"work, and dashing onwards and downwards with the agility of a deer, came"
"neck and neck with his rival, and having passed the Arab, cleared with a"
"bound the treacherous gully, landing true and safe upon the opposite"
"side.  The Arab followed in his tracks, his rider taking advantage of"
"the lead given; but the black stallion slipped and snorted, could not be"
"made to try the leap till another of the horses came up and took it,"
after which he sprang across with a vicious energy which tried the
"horsemanship of his rider, and tore like a wild thing after the leading"
pair.
These had cleared one after the other the wall and ditch; but the Arab
"was showing signs of distress, whilst Don Carlos looked fresh and eager"
as at the start.  There now remained only a quarter of a mile of smooth
"sward, and then the last critical jump; and Grey, knowing himself first,"
"and not knowing what had betided his rivals, sailed happily onward,"
"secure of victory, though he heard behind him the thud of flying horse"
"hoofs, and knew that the black stallion was not beaten yet.  It was he"
"who snorted with such excitement and fury, and seemed to awaken thunders"
with his iron-shod hoofs.
"One glance over his shoulder, and Grey passed his whip very lightly"
across the neck of Don Carlos. The gallant animal sprang forward like an
"arrow from a bow, showing how well within himself he had been travelling"
so far.  The sound of other beating hoofs was fainter now.  Grey looked
"keenly at the great obstacle looming up in his path, and measured the"
"height at various places, deciding where the leap could best be taken."
"Auxonne. There his health suffered considerably, not only from the"
"miasma of the marshes of the river Saône, but also from family"
anxieties and arduous literary toils. To these last it is now needful
"to refer. Indeed, the external events of his early life are of value"
only as they reveal the many-sidedness of his nature and the growth of
his mental powers.
How came he to outgrow the insular patriotism of his early years? The
foregoing recital of facts must have already suggested one obvious
"explanation. Nature had dowered him so prodigally with diverse gifts,"
"mainly of an imperious order, that he could scarcely have limited his"
"sphere of action to Corsica. Profoundly as he loved his island, it"
offered no sphere commensurate with his varied powers and masterful
will. It was no empty vaunt which his father had uttered on his
deathbed that his Napoleon would one day overthrow the old monarchies
and conquer Europe.[9] Neither did the great commander himself
"overstate the peculiarity of his temperament, when he confessed that"
"his instincts had ever prompted him that his will must prevail, and"
that what pleased him must of necessity belong to him. Most spoilt
"children harbour the same illusion, for a brief space. But all the"
buffetings of fortune failed to drive it from the young Buonaparte;
and when despair as to his future might have impaired the vigour of
"his domineering instincts, his mind and will acquired a fresh rigidity"
"by coming under the spell of that philosophizing doctrinaire,"
Rousseau.
There was every reason why he should early be attracted by this
"fantastic thinker. In that notable work, ""Le Contrat Social"" (1762),"
Rousseau called attention to the antique energy shown by the Corsicans
"in defence of their liberties, and in a startlingly prophetic phrase"
he exclaimed that the little island would one day astonish Europe. The
source of this predilection of Rousseau for Corsica is patent. Born
"If it is a double foetus with only one neck, the ruler will enlarge"
his land.
"If it is a double foetus with only one spine, the ruler will enlarge"
his land.
"If it is a double foetus with only one mouth, the land will remain"
under the command of the king.
"If it is a double foetus with only one breast, the land will be"
"enlarged, rule of a legitimate king."
In order to grasp the principles underlying the interpretation of such
"omens, we must take as our starting point the conceptions connected with"
the various parts of the body. Bearing in mind that the omens deal
primarily with public affairs and the general welfare and only to a
"limited extent with private and individual concerns[40], the head of the"
foetus by a natural association stands for the ruler or occasionally for
"the owner of the mother lamb. One head to the double foetus, therefore,"
indicates unity--a single rule--whereas two heads point to disruption of
some kind. If the double foetus is so entwined as to be shut in within an
"enclosure, a similarly natural association of ideas would lead to the"
"country being shut in, in a state of confusion, the land in a condition of"
"subjugation or the like. On the other hand, if merely the heads are"
enclosed so as to give the impression of unity and the rest of the two
"bodies is disentangled, the unfavorable sign is converted into a favorable"
one. A second principle involved in the interpretation results in a more
"favorable conclusion if the double foetus shows less complications. So, a"
single neck or a single spine or a single breast or a single mouth point
"again, like a single head, towards unity and therefore to flourishing"
"conditions in the land. In the case of legs and tails, to be sure, the"
and to wonder into what manner of company he had thrust himself.  He had
"never before been inside this house, though he had, in the first days of"
"his new career, taken his meals in some of the numerous coffee or"
"chocolate houses, or the taverns which abounded throughout the town."
"Latterly he had generally bought his food at the cheapest market, and"
had eaten it in the attic to which he had removed himself and his few
belongings.  He was beginning to wonder how long he should be able even
to retain that humble abode as his own.  Dame Fortune’s smiles seemed
"quite to have deserted him, and abject poverty stared him grimly in the"
face.
"A smoking lamp had been brought in, and hung overhead, lighting up the"
faces of the company with its yellow glare.  There was something strange
and Rembrandt-like in the effect of the picture upon which Grey’s eyes
"rested.  Leaning back dreamily with his head against the wall, he could"
"almost fancy himself back in one of those foreign picture galleries, in"
"which heretofore he had delighted, and where so many hours of his time"
had been spent.
"But this was a living picture, shifting, changing, breaking up into"
"groups and re-forming again; and the hum of talk went on unceasingly, as"
"one after another took up the word and launched forth his opinions,"
"generally in florid and flowery language, and with much gesticulation"
and indignation.
What first struck Grey as strange was the anger which seemed to possess
all these men.  That they were in no good case was well-nigh proved by
"the shabbiness of their dress, and by the fact of their being gathered"
"in this very humble and cheap place of resort, which would not tempt any"
"but those in adverse circumstances.  But over and above their poverty,"
"they seemed to be railing at neglect or injustice of some sort, and ever"
"and anon would break out into virulent abuse of some person or persons,"
mad.
"Indeed, our friend, the man in the street, when he becomes a family"
"man, without any pretensions to be a man of family, very often finds"
himself face to face with other problems. Shall he simply sing with
"the Psalmist “Like as the arrows in the hand of the giant, even so are"
the young children. Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of
"them,” or shall he be guided by the gloss of a modern interpreter who"
maintains that the oriental quiver was designed to hold but two or
three arrows at most?
Even when the plain man confines his interests to his business and
"seeks relaxations in “sport” alone, endeavouring to evade the puzzles"
"of politics and avoid all theologized inquiry, he cannot escape from"
ethical consideration. Professionalism in athletics and questions of
betting and bribery contend with his conviction that there is
"something which ennobles man in running and striving for mastery, and"
"it is futile to curse the bookmaker when his clients are so many, his"
occupation so lucrative.
The average man gets little guidance from pulpit or press. It is dull
"work reading sermons, even if sermons came in his way. From time to"
time some eloquent bishop or canon is reported in the Monday morning
"papers, but journalists know that the publication of a summary with,"
"in the case of a few of the preachers, some epigrams or denunciations,"
is all that can be permitted or expected. These may arouse the
"attention to the existence of evils, but give no guiding principle for"
their cure.
The habit of attendance at some place of worship is easily abandoned
"in the days of bachelor freedom, and rarely regained in maturer years."
Men for the most part find the preacher unconvincing. The usual
"For some time his tin-machines had been busy, night and day, turning"
"out great heaps of gleaming cans, while the carpenters and machinists"
"completed their tasks. The gill-netters were overhauling their gear,"
the beach was lined with fishing-boats. On the dock great piles of
"seines and drift-nets were being inspected. Three miles below, Big"
"George, with a picked crew and a pile-driver, was building the"
"fish-trap. It consisted of half-mile ""leads,"" or rows of piling, capped"
"with stringers, upon which netting was hung, and terminated in"
"""hearts,"" ""corrals,"" and ""spillers,"" the intricate arrangements of"
webbing and timbers out of which the fish were to be taken.
It was for the title to the ground where his present operations were
going forward that George had been so cruelly disciplined by the
"""interests;"" and while he had held stubbornly to his rights for years"
"in spite of the bitterest persecution, he was now for the first time"
able to utilize his site. Accordingly his exultation was tremendous.
"As for Boyd, the fever in his veins mounted daily as he saw his dream"
assuming concrete form. The many problems arising as the work advanced
afforded him unceasing activity; the unforeseen obstacles which were
"encountered hourly required swift and certain judgment, taxing his"
"ingenuity to the utmost. He became so filled with it all, so steeped"
"with the spirit of his surroundings, that he had thought for nothing"
"else. Every dawn marked the beginning of a new battle, every twilight"
"heralded another council. His duties swamped him; he was worried,"
"exultant, happy. Always he found Cherry at his shoulder, unobtrusive"
"and silent for the most part, yet intensely observant and keenly alive"
"to every action. She seemed to have the faculty of divination, knowing"
"when to be silent and when to join her mood with his, and she gave him"
valuable help; for she possessed a practical mind and a masculine
"aptitude for details that surprised both him and George. But, rapidly"
"ii, 2-4; Hume's ed. i, 328 _sq._). In fine, the conventional Spain"
"is a manufactured system, developed under a Teutonic dynasty. ""To a"
German race of sovereigns Spain finally owed the subversion of her
"national system and ancient freedom"" (Stubbs, _Const. Hist._ 4th"
"ed. i, 5)."
"No doubt the Dutch disaffection to Philip, which began to reveal itself"
"immediately after his accession, may be conceived as having economic"
"grounds. Indeed, his creation of fresh bishoprics, and his manipulation"
"of the abbey revenues, created instant and general resentment among"
"churchmen and nobles,[766] as compared with his mere continuation of"
"religious persecution; and despite his pledges to the contrary, certain"
posts in the Low Countries were conferred on Spaniards.[767] But had he
"shown his father's adaptability, all this could have been adjusted. Had"
he either lived at Brussels or made the Flemings feel that he held them
"an integral part of his empire, he would have had the zealous support of"
"the upper classes in suppressing the popular heresy, which repelled"
"them. Heresy in the Netherlands, indeed, seems thus far to have been on"
"the whole rather licentious and anarchic than austere or ""spiritual."""
"The pre-Protestant movements of the Béguines, Beghards, and Lollards,"
"beginning well, had turned out worse than the orders of friars in the"
"south; and the decorous ""Brethren of the Common Lot"" were in the main"
"""good churchmen,"" only a minority accepting Protestantism.[768] In face"
of the established formulas concerning the innate spirituality of the
"Teuton, and of the play of his ""conscience"" in his course at the"
"Reformation, there stand the historic facts that in the Teutonic world"
"alone was the Reformation accompanied by widespread antinomianism,"
"debauchery, and destructive violence. In France, Spain, and Italy there"
"were no such movements as the Anabaptist, which so far as it could go"
was almost a dissolution of sane society.[769] From Holland that
"movement drew much of its strength and leadership, even as, in a"
"previous age, the antinomian movement of Tanquelin had there had its"
"Italy_, says: ""The Bambino is a doll about three feet high, and it"
stands on a cushion in a glass case. It is clad in rich robes with
"a crown on its head, a regal order across its breast, and embroidered"
slippers on its feet. From head to foot it is one mass of dazzling
"jewelry, gold chains, strings of pearls, and diamond bracelets and"
"rings, which not only cover the neck, arms and fingers, but are"
"suspended, intermixed with crosses, stars, hearts, monograms, and"
"every kind of precious stone, to all parts of its body. The only part"
"unweighted with gems is its round, priest-like, wax face. But all this"
"display of wealth, great in itself, is really only suggestive of that"
"untold quantity which it has brought, and is still daily bringing,"
into the coffers of the church. People are continually kneeling before
"this dumb idol, offering petitions and leaving gifts, whilst letters"
"containing requests, accompanied with post-office orders and checks to"
"pay for the granting of the same, arrive by post for it from various"
"parts of the globe."""
Hare's _Walks in Rome_ gives the following account of the Bambino and
one of its most remarkable experiences:
"""It has servants of its own, and a carriage in which it drives"
"out with its attendants, and goes to visit the sick; for, though"
"an infant, it is the oldest medical practitioner in Rome. Devout"
peasants always kneel as the blessed infant passes. Formerly it was
"taken to sick persons and left on their beds for some hours, in the"
hope that it would work a miracle. Now it is never left alone. In
"explanation of this, it is said that an audacious woman formed the"
design of appropriating to herself the holy image and its benefits.
She had another doll prepared of the same size and appearance as the
"Santissimo, and having feigned sickness and obtained permission to have"
"it left with her, she dressed the false image in its clothes, and sent"
"it back to Ara Coeli. The fraud was not discovered till night, when the"
"assailant, felling him like an ox, then he in turn was blotted out by a"
"surge of rioters. But there was little time for observation, as the"
scene was changing with kaleidoscopic rapidity and there was the
ever-present necessity of self-protection. Seeing Clyde's helpless
"condition, Emerson shouted:"
"""Come on! I'll help you aboard the ship."" He found a hardwood club"
beneath his feet--one of those cudgels that are used in pounding
rope-slings and hawsers--and with it cleared a pathway for Clyde and
"himself. But while still at a distance from the ship's gangway, he"
"suddenly spied the man in the gray suit, who had climbed upon one of"
"the freight-piles, whence he was scanning the crowd. The man likewise"
"recognized Emerson, and pointed him out, crying something"
"unintelligible in the tumult, then leaped down from his vantage-point."
"The next instant Boyd saw him approaching, followed by several others."
"He endeavored to hustle Clyde to the big doors ahead of the oncomers,"
"but being intercepted, backed against the shed wall barely in time to"
beat off the foremost.
His nearest assailant had armed himself with an iron bar and endeavored
"to guard the first blow with this instrument, but it flew from his"
"grasp, and he sustained the main force of the impact on his forearm."
"Then, though Boyd fell back farther, the others rushed in and he found"
himself hard beset. What happened thereafter neither he nor Alton
"Clyde, who was half-dazed to begin with, ever clearly remembered, for"
in such over-charged instants the mental photograph is wont to be
either unusually distinct or else fogged to such a blur that only the
high-lights stand out clearly in retrospect.
"Before he had recognized the personal nature of the assault, Emerson"
found himself engaged in a furious hand-to-hand struggle where a want
"of room hampered the free use of his cudgel, and he was forced to rely"
when convicted of error.
Erasmus perhaps never quite realized how much his philological-critical
method must shake the foundations of the Church. He was surprised at his
adversaries 'who could not but believe that all their authority would
"perish at once when the sacred books might be read in a purified form,"
and when people tried to understand them in the original'. He did not
feel what the unassailable authority of a sacred book meant. He rejoices
"because Holy Scripture is approached so much more closely, because all"
sorts of shadings are brought to light by considering not only what is
"said but also by whom, for whom, at what time, on what occasion, what"
"precedes and what follows, in short, by the method of historical"
philological criticism. To him it seemed so especially pious when
reading Scripture and coming across a place which seemed contrary to the
"doctrine of Christ or the divinity of his nature, to believe rather that"
one did not understand the phrase _or that the text might be corrupt_.
Unperceived he passed from emendation of the different versions to the
correction of the contents. The epistles were not all written by the
apostles to whom they are attributed. The apostles themselves made
"mistakes, at times."
The foundation of his spiritual life was no longer a unity to Erasmus.
"It was, on the one hand, a strong desire for an upright, simple, pure"
"and homely belief, the earnest wish to be a good Christian. But it was"
"also the irresistible intellectual and aesthetic need of the good taste,"
"the harmony, the clear and exact expression of the Ancients, the dislike"
of what was cumbrous and involved. Erasmus thought that good learning
might render good service for the necessary purification of the faith
and its forms. The measure of church hymns should be corrected. That
"Christian expression and classicism were incompatible, he never"
believed. The man who in the sphere of sacred studies asked every author
for his credentials remained unconscious of the fact that he
Everywhere in the empire the two religions lived in intimate communion. By
"ingratiating themselves with the Phrygian priests, the priests of Mithra"
obtained the support of an official institution and shared in the
"protection granted by the state. Moreover, men alone could participate in"
"the secret ceremonies of the Persian liturgy, at least in the Occident."
"Other {66} mysteries, to which women could be admitted, had therefore to be"
"added in order to complete them, and so the mysteries of Cybele received"
the wives and daughters of the Mithraists.
This union had even more important consequences for the old religion of
Pessinus than the partial infusion of Judaic beliefs had had. Its theology
"gained a deeper meaning and an elevation hitherto unknown, after it had"
adopted some of the conceptions of Mazdaism.
"The introduction of the taurobolium in the ritual of the _Magna Mater_,"
"where it appeared after the middle of the first century, was probably"
"connected with this transformation. We know the nature of this sacrifice,"
of which Prudentius gives a stirring description based on personal
"recollection of the proceeding. On an open platform a steer was killed, and"
"the blood dropped down upon the mystic, who was standing in an excavation"
"below. ""Through the thousand crevices in the wood,"" says the poet, ""the"
bloody dew runs down into the pit. The neophyte receives the falling drops
"on his head, clothes and body. He leans backward to have his cheeks, his"
"ears, his lips and his nostrils wetted; he pours the liquid over his eyes,"
"and does not even spare his palate, for he moistens his tongue with blood"
"and drinks it eagerly.""[33] After submitting to this repulsive sprinkling"
he offered himself to the veneration of the crowd. They believed that he
"was purified of his faults, and had become the equal of the deity through"
his red baptism.
Although the origin of this sacrifice that took place in the mysteries of
"Cybele at Rome is as yet shrouded in obscurity, recent discoveries enable"
seems to have returned his love; for in the stormy sunset of his life
at St. Helena he recalled some delicious walks at dawn when Caroline
and he had--eaten cherries together. One lingers fondly over these
"scenes of his otherwise stern career, for they reveal his capacity for"
"social joys and for deep and tender affection, had his lot been"
"otherwise cast. How different might have been his life, had France"
"never conquered Corsica, and had the Revolution never burst forth! But"
Corsica was still his dominant passion. When he was called away from
"Valence to repress a riot at Lyons, his feelings, distracted for a"
"time by Caroline, swerved back towards his island home; and in"
"September, 1786, he had the joy of revisiting the scenes of his"
"childhood. Warmly though he greeted his mother, brothers and sisters,"
"after an absence of nearly eight years, his chief delight was in the"
"rocky shores, the verdant dales and mountain heights of Corsica. The"
"odour of the forests, the setting of the sun in the sea ""as in the"
"bosom of the infinite,"" the quiet proud independence of the"
"mountaineers themselves, all enchanted him. His delight reveals almost"
"Wertherian powers of ""sensibility."" Even the family troubles could not"
"damp his ardour. His father had embarked on questionable speculations,"
"which now threatened the Buonapartes with bankruptcy, unless the"
French Government proved to be complacent and generous. With the hope
"of pressing one of the family claims on the royal exchequer, the"
second son procured an extension of furlough and sped to Paris. There
"at the close of 1787 he spent several weeks, hopefully endeavouring to"
extract money from the bankrupt Government. It was a season of
disillusionment in more senses than one; for there he saw for himself
"the seamy side of Parisian life, and drifted for a brief space about"
the giddy vortex of the Palais Royal. What a contrast to the limpid
life of Corsica was that turbid frothy existence--already swirling
towards its mighty plunge!
"After a furlough of twenty-one months he rejoined his regiment, now at"
curiosities of the Seattle water-front. Not only is there the
"inevitable confusion involved in the departure of an overloaded craft,"
but likewise there is all the noisy excitement that attends a shipment
of Oriental troops.
The Chinese maintain such a clatter as to drown the hoarse cries of the
"stevedores, the complaint of the creaking tackle, and the rumble of the"
"winches. They scurry hither and yon like a distracted army, forever in"
"the way, shouting, clacking, squealing in senseless turmoil. They are"
"timid as to the water, and for them a voyage is at all times beset with"
many alarms. It is no more possible to restrain them than to calm a
"frightened herd of wild pigs, nor will they embark at all until their"
frenzy has run its course and died of its own exhaustion. To discipline
"them according to the seamen's standard is inadvisable, for many of"
"them are ""cutters,"" big, evil, saffron-hued fellows, whose trade it is"
to butcher and in whose dextrous hands a knife becomes a frightful
weapon.
"The Japs, ordinarily so noiseless and submissive, yield to the"
contagion and add their share to the uproar. Each man carries a few
"pounds of baggage in bundles or packs or valises, and these scanty"
belongings he guards with shrieking solicitude.
While the pandemonium of the Orientals who gathered to board _The
"Bedford Castle_ was sufficient in itself to cause consternation, it was"
as nothing to that which broke loose when the fishermen began to
"assemble. To a man they were drunk, belligerent and, declamatory. A"
"few, to be sure, were still busy with the tag ends of the cargo, but"
"the majority had gone to their lodgings for their packs, and now"
reappeared in a state of the wildest exuberance; for this would be
"their last spree of the season, and before them lay a period of long,"
"sleepless nights, exposure, and unceasing labor, wherein a year's work"
doubling back to the eastward and laying a cautious course along the
second leg of the journey.
Once through the ragged barrier that separates the North Pacific from
"her sister sea, the dank breath of the Arctic smote them fairly. The"
breeze that wafted out from the north brought with it the chill of
"limitless ice-fields, and the first night found them hove-to among the"
outposts of that shifting desert of death which debouches out of
"Behring Straits with the first approach of autumn, to retreat again"
only at the coming of reluctant summer. From the crow's-nest the
lookout stared down upon a white expanse that stretched beyond the
"horizon. At dawn they began their careful search, feeling their way"
eastward through the open lanes and tortuous passages that separated
"the floes, now laying-to for the northward set of the fields to clear a"
"path before them, now stealing through some narrow lead that opened"
into freer waters.
"_The Bedford Castle_ was a steel hull whose sides, opposed to the jaws"
"of the ponderous masses, would have been crushed like an eggshell in a"
"vise. Unlike a wooden ship, the gentlest contact would have sprung her"
"plates, while any considerable collision would have pierced her as if"
she had been built of paper. Appreciating to the full the peril of his
"slow advance, Captain Peasley did all the navigating in person; but"
eventually they were hemmed in so closely that for a day and a night
"they could do nothing but drift with the pack. In time, however, the"
winds opened a crevice through which they retreated to follow the outer
"limits farther eastward, until they were balked again."
"Opposed to them were the forces of Nature, and they were wholly"
"dependent upon her fickle favor. It might be a day, a week, a month"
"before she would let them through, and, even when the barrier began to"
"yield, another ship, a league distant, might profit by an opening which"
"With the sample page accepted by the publisher or author, or both,"
the printer is authorized to proceed with the typesetting. Setting
"type by hand is now almost entirely superseded by machine-composition,"
except for the display pages (such as the title) and where the type
"itself runs larger than the English (14-point) size, this being the"
limit of the machines. Linotype[37] composition is cheaper than
"monotype,[37] but as the type is cast all in one line, instead of in"
"separate characters, the cost of corrections is much higher. To change"
even a mark of punctuation requires recasting the entire line. If the
"manuscript is reasonably final in its form, the publisher is likely to"
"order linotype composition; otherwise, monotype will be selected. Both"
machines carry the standard faces and sizes of type.
THE PROOFS
"The first proofs sent out by the printer are called ""galley-slips,"""
"or ""galleys.""[38] These are supposed to give the author opportunity"
to make such changes as are absolutely necessary. When returned to
"the printer, these galleys are made up into ""page-proofs,""[38] and"
"frequently go again to the author, or the type may be ""cast"" (made"
into electrotype plates) at this point. When page-proofs are submitted
"to the author, the publisher expects him to revise them, making sure"
"that all his galley corrections have been properly made, rather than"
"to make further corrections, as changes in the pages are still more"
"expensive than in the galleys. If changes must be made, the author"
should endeavor to have the correction occupy exactly the same space as
"the matter cut out, or to cut out further matter to make room for the"
"addition. Otherwise, the page so corrected will contain more than the"
"standard number of lines, which must be thrown forward, and the make-up"
of each page changed to the end of the chapter.
heritage of our national culture through the medium of our own
literature. I was thus to consider myself one with the people and never
to place myself in an equivocal position of assumed superiority. This I
realised more particularly when later I wished to go to Europe and to
"compete for the Indian Civil Service, his refusal as regards that"
"particular career was absolute. I was to rule nobody but myself, I was"
to be a scholar not an administrator.
THE HISTORY OF A FAILURE THAT WAS GREAT
There has been some complaint that the experiment of meeting out cut and
dried moral texts as a part of school routine has not proved to be so
effective as was expected by their promulgators. The moral education
which we received in our childhood was very indirect and came from
listening to stories recited by the 'Kathas' on various incidents
connected with our great epics. Their effect on our minds was very
great; this may be because our racial memory makes us more prone to
respond to certain ideals that have been impressed on the consciousness
of the nation. These early appeals to our emotions have remained
persistent; the only difference is that which was there as a narrative
"of incidents more or less historical, is now realised as eternally true,"
being an allegory of the unending struggle of the human soul in its
choice between what is material and that other something which
transcends it. The only pictures now in my study are a few frescoes done
for me by Abanindra Nath Tagore and Nanda Lal Bose. The first fresco
"represents Her, who is the Sustainer of the Universe. She stands"
pedestalled on the lotus of our heart. The world was at peace; but a
change has come. And She under whose Veil of Compassion we had been
"protected so long, suddenly flings us to the world of conflict. Our"
"great epic, the Mahabharata, deals with this great conflict, and the few"
frescoes delineate some of the fundamental incidents. The coming of the
But he who has surmounted his patriotism and has attained complete
impartiality would not selfishly claim the only benefit of war entirely
"for his own country, but would desire all to share it alike, and would"
therefore wish defeat for every warring nation.
If a horde of British and a horde of German soldiers engage in mutual
"butchery, and if the maimed, broken remnants of the British horde have"
"just enough order left to drive back the remnants of the German horde,"
leaving innumerable dead and wounded and for ever darkening the lives of
"countless friends and wives--in other words, if the British army wins"
"what our infamous Press would call a ""glorious victory""--then all that"
is evil in the life of the nation is encouraged and justified. It is
then that the diplomatists who lied and schemed to bring on the
"monstrous event, that all the politicians who exploit and foster the"
"nation's madness and misery to enhance their own reputations, that those"
"who batten on the slaughter, and that those who glorify the carnage at"
"a safe distance and fight the enemy with their lying tongues, are"
"justified. They all are justified. But if, instead of victory, there is"
"defeat, then they tremble lest they should be disgraced and lose their"
"places, lest they should be victims of a disillusioned people's anger,"
"lest they should forfeit their plunder, lest they should be called to"
account for the lies with which they fooled the masses. Defeat is the
"defeat of evil, victory is the victory of evil."

A second batch of papers arrived. The German advance was continuing. The
British reverse was becoming catastrophic. At first I felt a kind of
"grimness, and then I was thrilled by the thought that perhaps the end of"
"the war might be near. We might not have a good peace, but peace of any"
kind was preferable to war. The mendacious Press talked much about a
"""dishonourable peace,"" as though any peace could be as dishonourable as"
The dull green time-stained panes of the windows look upon each other
with the cowardly glances of cheats. Through the street and towards the
"adjacent mountain, runs the sinuous path, winding through the deep"
ditches filled with rain-water.  Here and there are piled heaps of dust
and other rubbish--either refuse or else put there purposely to keep
"the rain-water from flooding the houses. On the top of the mountain,"
"among green gardens with dense foliage, beautiful stone houses lie"
"hidden; the belfries of the churches rise proudly towards the sky, and"
their gilded crosses shine beneath the rays of the sun. During the
rainy weather the neighbouring town pours its water into this main
"road, which, at other times, is full of its dust, and all these"
"miserable houses seem, as it were, thrown by some powerful hand into"
"that heap of dust, rubbish, and rain-water.  They cling to the ground"
"beneath the high mountain, exposed to the sun, surrounded by decaying"
"refuse, and their sodden appearance impresses one with the same feeling"
as would the half-rotten trunk of an old tree.
"At the end of the main street, as if thrown out of the town, stood a"
"two-storied house, which had been rented from Petunikoff, a merchant"
"and resident of the town.  It was in comparatively good order, being"
"further from the mountain, while near it were the open fields, and"
about half-a-mile away the river ran its winding course.
This large old house had the most dismal aspect amidst its
surroundings.  The walls bent outwards and there was hardly a pane of
"glass in any of the windows, except some of the fragments which looked"
like the water of the marshes--dull green.  The spaces of wall between
"the windows were covered with spots, as if time were trying to write"
"there in hieroglyphics the history of the old house, and the tottering"
roof added still more to its pitiable condition. It seemed as if the
"whole building bent towards the ground, to await the last stroke of"
solid movement. It was complex and contained the seeds of discord
which lurk in many-sided and militant creeds. The theories of its
intellectual champions were as diverse as the motives which spurred on
their followers to the attack on the outworn abuses of the age.
Discontent and faith were the ultimate motive powers of the
Revolution. Faith prepared the Revolution and discontent accomplished
"it. Idealists who, in varied planes of thought, preached the doctrine"
"of human perfectibility, succeeded in slowly permeating the dull"
toiling masses of France with hope. Omitting here any notice of
"philosophic speculation as such, we may briefly notice the teachings"
of three writers whose influence on revolutionary politics was to be
"definite and practical. These were Montesquieu, Voltaire, and"
"Rousseau. The first was by no means a revolutionist, for he decided in"
"favour of a mixed form of government, like that of England, which"
"guaranteed the State against the dangers of autocracy, oligarchy, and"
mob-rule. Only by a ricochet did he assail the French monarchy. But he
re-awakened critical inquiry; and any inquiry was certain to sap the
base of the _ancien régime_ in France. Montesquieu's teaching inspired
the group of moderate reformers who in 1789 desired to re-fashion the
institutions of France on the model of those of England. But popular
sentiment speedily swept past these Anglophils towards the more
attractive aims set forth by Voltaire.
"This keen thinker subjected the privileged classes, especially the"
"titled clergy, to a searching fire of philosophic bombs and barbed"
witticisms. Never was there a more dazzling succession of literary
triumphs over a tottering system. The satirized classes winced and
"laughed, and the intellect of France was conquered, for the"
Revolution. Thenceforth it was impossible that peasants who were
nominally free should toil to satisfy the exacting needs of the
"State, and to support the brilliant bevy of nobles who flitted gaily"
"must be crowded into three months. They, therefore, inaugurated the"
change in befitting style.
"On the whole, no explosive has ever been invented that is so noisy in"
"its effect, so furiously expansive in its action, as the fumes of cheap"
whiskey. The great dock-shed soon began to reverberate to the wildest
"clamor, which added to the fury of the crowd outside. The strikers,"
"unable to enter the building, flowed down upon the adjoining wharf, or"
"clambered to the roofs nearby, whence they jeered insultingly. Among"
"them was a newspaper photographer, bent on securing an unusual picture"
"for his publication, and in truth the scene from this point of view was"
sufficiently novel and striking.
"The decks of the big, low-lying tramp steamer were piled high with gear"
of every description. A trio of stout tow-boats were blocked up
"amidships, long piles of lumber rose higher than a man's head, and the"
"roofs of the deck-houses were jammed with fishing-boats nested, one"
"inside the other, like pots in a kitchen. Every available inch was"
"crowded with cases of gasoline, of groceries, and of the varied"
"provisions required on an expedition of this magnitude. Aft, on rows of"
"hooks, were suspended the carcasses of sheep and bullocks and hogs;"
there seemed to be nowhere another foot of available room. The red
"water-line of the ship was already submerged, yet notwithstanding this"
"fact her derricks clanged noisily, her booms swung back and forth, and"
her gaping hatches swallowed momentary loads. Those fishermen who had
"come aboard early had settled like flies in the rigging, whence they"
"taunted their enemies, hurling back insult for insult."
It was much like the departure of a gold steamer during the early
"famine stages of the northward stampede, save that now there were no"
"women, while the confusion was immeasurably greater, and through it all"
might be felt a certain strained and angry menace. All the long
"not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love Christ whom"
he hath not seen? A mind untouched by the agonies and wrongs
"which invest London hospitals and lanes with horror, could not"
"be moved by the sufferings of a single individual, however"
"holy, who died eighteen centuries ago."
“No; the essence of the belief is the belief in the Divinity of
Christ. But accept that belief; think for a moment of all that
"implies, and you must admit that your Christianity becomes"
dogmatic in the highest degree. Our conceptions of the world
and its meaning are more radically changed than our conceptions
"of the material universe, when the sun instead of the earth"
"becomes its centre. _Every view of history, every theory of our"
"duty, must be radically transformed by contact with that"
Stupendous Mystery._ Whether you accept or reject the special
tenets of the Athanasian Creed is an infinitesimal trifle. You
are bound to assume that every religion which does not take
"this dogma into account is without true vital force. Infidels,"
"heathens, and Unitarians reject the single influence which"
alone can mould our lives in conformity with the everlasting
"laws of the universe. Of course, there are tricks of sleight of"
hand by which the conclusion is evaded. It would be too long
and too trifling to attempt to expose them. Unsectarian
Christianity consists in shirking the difficulty without
"meeting it, and trying hard to believe that the passion can"
survive without its essential basis. It proclaims the love of
"Christ as our motive, whilst it declines to make up its mind"
whether Christ was God or man; or endeavours to escape a
categorical answer under a cloud of unsubstantial rhetoric. But
"the difference between man and God is infinite, and no effusion"
of superlatives will disguise the plain fact from honest
minds. To be a Christian in any real sense you must start from
and its monuments rival those of Cybele in number and variety. In the Latin
"Occident, however, no trace of it can be found, because it had been"
"absorbed by the worship of _Magna Mater_. In Asia itself, Attis and Mèn"
"were sometimes considered identical, and this involved the Roman world in a"
"complete confusion of those two persons, who in reality were very"
different. A marble statue discovered at Ostia represents Attis holding the
"lunar crescent, which was the characteristic emblem of Mèn. His"
"assimilation to the ""tyrant"" of the infernal regions transformed the"
"shepherd of Ida into a master of the underworld, an office that he combined"
with his former one as author of resurrection.
A second title that was given to him reveals another influence. A certain
Roman inscription is dedicated to Attis the Supreme ([Greek: Attei
hupsistôi]).[27] This epithet is very significant. In Asia Minor
"""Hypsistos"" was the appellation used to designate the god of Israel.[28] A"
"number of pagan thiasi had arisen who, though not exactly submitting to the"
"practice of the synagogue, yet worshiped none but the Most High, the"
"Supreme God, the Eternal God, God the Creator, to whom every mortal owed"
service. These must have been the attributes ascribed to Cybele's companion
"by the author of the inscription, because the verse continues: ([Greek: kai"
"sunechonti to pan]) ""To thee, who containest and maintainest all"
"things.""[29] Must we then believe that Hebraic monotheism had some"
influence upon the mysteries of the Great Mother? This is not at all
improbable. We know that numerous Jewish colonies were established in
"Phrygia by the Seleucides, and that {63} these expatriated Jews agreed to"
certain compromises in order to conciliate their hereditary faith with that
of the pagans in whose midst they lived. It is also possible that the
clergy of Pessinus suffered the ascendancy of the Biblical theology. Under
"the empire Attis and Cybele became the ""almighty gods"" (_omnipotentes_)"
"_par excellence_, and it is easy to see in this new conception a leaning"
"upon Semitic or Christian doctrines, more probably upon Semitic ones.[30]"
ideas is concerned. He does not hold that all sensation is a percept
"involving extension and much else--involving, indeed, existence."
"Following upon Reid, Dugald Stewart obtained a very considerable"
"reputation, and he was living and writing at the time Ferrier was a"
"young man. His main idea would, however, seem to have been to guard his"
"utterances carefully, and enter upon no keen discussions or"
"contentions: when a bold assertion is made, it is always under shelter"
of some good authority. But his rounded phrases gained him considerable
"admiration, as such writing often does. He carried--perhaps"
inadvertently--Reid's views farther than he would probably have held as
"justifiable. He says we are not, properly speaking, conscious of self"
"or the existence of self, but merely of a sensation or some other"
"quality, which, by a _subsequent suggestion_ of the understanding,"
leads to a belief in that which exercises the quality. This is the
"doctrine of Reid put very crudely, and in a manner calculated to bring"
us back to unrelated sensation in earnest. Stewart adopted a new
"expression for Reid's 'common-sense,' _i.e._ the 'fundamental laws of"
"belief,' which might be less ambiguous, but never took popular hold as"
did the first.
There were many others belonging to this school besides Reid and
"Stewart, whom it would be impossible to speak of here. The Scottish"
"Philosophy had its work to do, and no doubt understood that work--the"
first essential in a criticism: it endeavoured to vindicate perception
"as against sensational idealism, and it only partially succeeded in its"
task. But we must be careful not to forget that it opened up the way
for a more comprehensive and satisfactory point of view. It was with
Kant that the distinction arose between sensation and the forms
"necessary to its perception, the form of space and time, and so on. As"
"to this part of the theory of knowledge, Reid and his school were not"
clear; they only made an effort to express the fact that something was
"And, in fine, though we trembled at the thought of the open road, and"
"my heart for one grew sick as I looked from Marie to my lady, and"
"reckoned the long tale of leagues which lay between us and Cassel, the"
risk had to be run.
Steve had discovered a more easy though longer way out of the
"willow-bed, and two hours before midnight on the second night, he and"
I mounted the women and prepared to set out. He arranged that we
should go in the same order in which we had come: that he should lead
"the march, and I bring up the rear, while the Waldgrave, who was still"
"far from well, and whose continued lack of vigour troubled us the more"
"as we said little about it, should ride with my lady."
"The night seemed likely to be fine, but the darkness, the sough of the"
"wind as it swept over the plain, and the melancholy plashing of the"
"water as our horses plodded through it, were not things of a kind to"
"allay our fears. When we at last left our covert, and reaching the"
"road stood to listen, the fall of a leaf made us start. Though no"
sounds but those of the night came to our ears--and some of these were
"of a kind to reassure us--we said 'Hush!' again and again, and only"
moved on after a hundred alarums and assurances.
"I walked by Marie, with my hand on the withers of her horse, but we"
"did not talk. The two waiting-women riding double were before us, and"
their muttered fears alone broke the silence which prevailed at the
"end of the train. We went at the rate of about two leagues an hour,"
"Steve and I and the men running where the roads were good, and"
everywhere and at all times urging the horses to do their best. The
"haste of our movements, the darkness, our constant alarm, and the"
occasional confusion when the rear pressed on the van at an awkward
"place, had the effect of upsetting the balance of our minds; so"
that the most common impulse of flight--to press forward with
"when men were crying for their rights, when they had awakened to a"
"sense of their possessions, and would take nothing in their place. The"
real chieftains were no more; they were imitation chieftains only who
"were playing at the game, and it was a game the clansmen would not join"
in. Few exercises could be more strange than first to read the account
of Scottish life in one of the immortal novels by Scott dealing with
"last century, and then to turn to Miss Ferrier or Galt, depicting a"
"period not so very different. Setting aside all questions of genius,"
"where comparison would be absurd, it would seem as if a beautiful"
"enamel had been removed, and a bare reality revealed, somewhat sordid"
"in comparison. The life was not really sordid,--realism as usual had"
"overshot its mark,--but the enamel had been somewhat thickly laid, and"
"might require to be removed, if truth were to be revealed."
So in the higher grades of Edinburgh society the enamel of gentility
has done its best to prejudice us against much true and genuine worth.
"It was characterised by a certain conventional unconventionality, a"
certain 'preciosity' which brought it near deserving a still stronger
"name, and it maintained its right to formulate the canons of criticism"
"for the kingdom. Edinburgh, it must be recollected, was no 'mean city,'"
no ordinary provincial town. It was still esteemed a metropolis. It had
"its aristocracy, though mainly of the order of those unable to bear the"
"greater expense of London life. It had no manufactories to speak of, no"
"mercantile class to 'vulgarise' it; it possessed a University, and the"
law courts of the nation. But above all it had a literary society. In
"the beginning of the century it had such men as Henry Mackenzie, Dugald"
"Stewart, John Playfair, Dr. Gregory, Dr. Thomas Brown, not to speak of"
Scott and Jeffrey--a society unrivalled out of London. And in later
"days, when these were gone, others rose to fill their places."
"Of course, in addition to the movement of the working people, there was"
"an educated protest against Toryism, and it was made by a party who, to"
"avoid saying outright, 'I did not write it'. Those who know other"
"humanists, and know how frequently and impudently they lied, will"
perhaps think more lightly of Erasmus's sins.
"For the rest, even during his lifetime he did not escape punishment for"
"his eternal reserve, his proficiency in semi-conclusions and veiled"
"truths, insinuations and slanderous allusions. The accusation of perfidy"
"was often cast in his teeth, sometimes in serious indignation. 'You are"
"always engaged in bringing suspicion upon others,' Edward Lee exclaims."
"'How dare you usurp the office of a general censor, and condemn what you"
have hardly ever tasted? How dare you despise all but yourself? Falsely
and insultingly do you expose your antagonist in the _Colloquia_.' Lee
"quotes the spiteful passage referring to himself, and then exclaims:"
"'Now from these words the world may come to know its divine, its censor,"
"its modest and sincere author, that Erasmian diffidence, earnest,"
decency and honesty! Erasmian modesty has long been proverbial. You are
"always using the words ""false accusations"". You say: if I was"
"consciously guilty of the smallest of all his (Lee's) false accusations,"
"I should not dare to approach the Lord's table!--O man, who are you, to"
"judge another, a servant who stands or falls before his Lord?'"
"This was the first violent attack from the conservative side, in the"
"beginning of 1520, when the mighty struggle which Luther's action had"
unchained kept the world in ever greater suspense. Six months later
followed the first serious reproaches on the part of radical reformers.
"Ulrich von Hutten, the impetuous, somewhat foggy-headed knight, who"
"wanted to see Luther's cause triumph as the national cause of Germany,"
"turns to Erasmus, whom, at one time, he had enthusiastically acclaimed"
"as the man of the new weal, with the urgent appeal not to forsake the"
cause of the reformation or to compromise it. 'You have shown yourself
fearful in the affair of Reuchlin; now in that of Luther you do your
utmost to convince his adversaries that you are altogether averse from
"America a very uncomfortable country, unless he happens to be an eminent"
writer. Exactly the same kind of restraints upon freedom of thought are
bound to occur in every country where economic organization has been
carried to the point of practical monopoly. Therefore the safeguarding
of liberty in the world which is growing up is far more difficult than
"it was in the nineteenth century, when free competition was still a"
reality. Whoever cares about the freedom of the mind must face this
"situation fully and frankly, realizing the inapplicability of methods"
which answered well enough while industrialism was in its infancy.
"There are two simple principles which, if they were adopted, would solve"
almost all social problems. The first is that education should have for
one of its aims to teach people only to believe propositions when there
is some reason to think that they are true. The second is that jobs
should be given solely for fitness to do the work.
To take the second point first. The habit of considering a man’s
"religious, moral, and political opinions before appointing him to a post"
"or giving him a job is the modern form of persecution, and it is likely"
to become quite as efficient as the Inquisition ever was. The old
liberties can be legally retained without being of the slightest use.
"If, in practice, certain opinions lead a man to starve, it is poor"
comfort to him to know that his opinions are not punishable by law.
There is a certain public feeling against starving men for not belonging
"to the Church of England, or for holding slightly unorthodox opinions in"
politics. But there is hardly any feeling against the rejection of
"Atheists or Mormons, extreme communists, or men who advocate free love."
"Such men are thought to be wicked, and it is considered only natural to"
refuse to employ them. People have hardly yet waked up to the fact that
"this refusal, in a highly industrial State, amounts to a very rigorous"
form of persecution.
to lead it back from the now turbid pools to those living and most pure
"fountain-heads, those most limpid sources of gospel doctrine--thus he"
saw the task of divinity. The metaphor of the limpid water is not
without meaning here; it reveals the psychological quality of Erasmus's
fervent principle.
"'How is it', he exclaims, 'that people give themselves so much trouble"
about the details of all sorts of remote philosophical systems and
neglect to go to the sources of Christianity itself?' 'Although this
"wisdom, which is so excellent that once for all it put the wisdom of all"
"the world to shame, may be drawn from these few books, as from a"
"crystalline source, with far less trouble than is the wisdom of"
Aristotle from so many thorny books and with much more fruit.... The
equipment for that journey is simple and at everyone's immediate
disposal. This philosophy is accessible to everybody. Christ desires
that his mysteries shall be spread as widely as possible. I should wish
that all good wives read the Gospel and Paul's Epistles; that they were
translated into all languages; that out of these the husbandman sang
"while ploughing, the weaver at his loom; that with such stories the"
traveller should beguile his wayfaring.... This sort of philosophy is
"rather a matter of disposition than of syllogisms, rather of life than"
"of disputation, rather of inspiration than of erudition, rather of"
"transformation than of logic.... What is the philosophy of Christ, which"
"he himself calls _Renascentia_, but the insaturation of Nature created"
"good?--moreover, though no one has taught us this so absolutely and"
"effectively as Christ, yet also in pagan books much may be found that is"
in accordance with it.'
Such was the view of life of this biblical humanist. As often as Erasmus
"reverts to these matters, his voice sounds clearest. 'Let no one', he"
"says in the preface to the notes to the New Testament, 'take up this"
"work, as he takes up Gellius's _Noctes atticae_ or Poliziano's"
"conviction that he knew all about the places he had visited, and this"
"conviction, enunciated with pompous emphasis, supplanted the real"
knowledge and understanding derived from honest observation. Like so
"many people who do not possess the faculty of experiencing, he"
continually appealed to his own experience and continually referred to
"his maturer years, as though old age of itself brought wisdom."
"As for the war itself he took no deep interest in it, although he"
"glanced at the war news every day. But to understand it, to analyse its"
"causes, to grasp its significance, to realize its true nature, that he"
never attempted to do. His labels and his alleged experiences and his
years were sufficient to cope with the entire question and answer it
satisfactorily for himself. I almost envied him for his
self-sufficiency. He would never suffer acutely from any mental strife
or agitation due to any but immediate and personal causes. Perhaps such
a stable mentality that can without effort reject all inconvenient data
is the most desirable of all and the most conducive to happiness.
Certain it is that the stability of society and the very existence of
civilization itself depend upon the preponderance of that particular
type.
"I knew that the argument was hopeless. Indeed, it was no argument. It"
was no exchange of ideas. It was no mutual attempt at discovering truths
by an impartial comparison of two different attitudes.
At times there were signs of heat on both sides. My opponent spoke of
"""our democratic army"" (familiar phrase!) and the overbearing manner in"
"which he connected this dictum with a number of false, irrelevant or"
arbitrary generalizations made me feel a momentary pang of anger and I
"wished he could experience a term of military service. Nevertheless,"
there was no actual display of bad temper or emotion and we parted with
all the habitual formulae imposed by social decorum.
"valley. The Egyptian gods enjoyed a precarious immortality, for they were"
liable to destruction and dependent on necessities. According to a very
"primitive conception that always remained alive, they had to be fed,"
clothed and refreshed every day or else perish. From this fact arose the
necessity of a liturgy that was practically the same in every district. It
was practised for thousands of years and opposed its unaltering form to the
multiplicity of legends and local beliefs.[61]
"This daily liturgy was translated into Greek, perhaps later into Latin"
also; it was adapted to the new requirements by the founders of the
"Serapeum, and faithfully observed in the Roman temples of the Alexandrian"
gods. The essential ceremony always was the opening (_apertio_)[62] of the
sanctuary. At dawn the statue of the divinity was uncovered and shown to
"the community in the _naos_, that had been closed and sealed during the"
"night.[63] Then, again as in Egypt, the priest lit the sacred fire and"
"offered libations of water supposed to be from the deified Nile,[64] while"
"he chanted the usual hymns to the sound of flutes. Finally, ""erect upon the"
"threshold""--I translate literally from Porphyry--""he awakens the god by"
"calling to him in the Egyptian language.""[65] As we see, the god was"
"revived by the sacrifice and, as under the Pharaohs, awoke from his slumber"
at the calling of {96} his name. As a matter of fact the name was
indissolubly connected with the personality; he who could pronounce the
exact name of an individual or of a divinity was obeyed as a master by his
slave.[66] This fact made it necessary to maintain the original form of
that mysterious word. There was no other motive for the introduction of a
number of barbarian appellatives into the magical incantations.
"It is also probable that the toilet of the statue was made every day, that"
"its body and head were dressed,[67] as in the Egyptian ritual. We have seen"
that the _ornatrices_ or _stolistes_ were especially entrusted with these
duties. The idol was covered with sumptuous raiment and ornamented with
jewels and gems. An inscription furnishes us with an inventory of the
"issue. Definite mis-statements of fact can be legitimately objected to,"
"but they are by no means necessary. The mere words “Pear’s Soap,” which"
"affirm nothing, cause people to buy that article. If, wherever these"
"words appear, they were replaced by the words “The Labour Party,”"
"millions of people would be led to vote for the Labour Party, although"
the advertisements had claimed no merit for it whatever. But if both
sides in a controversy were confined by law to statements which a
"committee of eminent logicians considered relevant and valid, the main"
"evil of propaganda, as at present conducted, would remain. Suppose,"
"under such a law, two parties with an equally good case, one of whom had"
"a million pounds to spend on propaganda, while the other had only a"
hundred thousand. It is obvious that the arguments in favour of the
richer party would become more widely known than those in favour of the
"poorer party, and therefore the richer party would win. This situation"
"is, of course, intensified when one party is the Government. In Russia"
"the Government has an almost complete monopoly of propaganda, but that"
is not necessary. The advantages which it possesses over its opponents
"will generally be sufficient to give it the victory, unless it has an"
exceptionally bad case.
"The objection to propaganda is not only its appeal to unreason, but"
still more the unfair advantage which it gives to the rich and powerful.
Equality of opportunity among opinions is essential if there is to be
real freedom of thought; and equality of opportunity among opinions can
"only be secured by elaborate laws directed to that end, which there is"
no reason to expect to see enacted. The cure is not to be sought
"primarily in such laws, but in better education and a more sceptical"
"public opinion. For the moment, however, I am not concerned to discuss"
cures.

"obstacle to freedom of thought, but I wish now to deal with it on more"
New York are the best that have ever existed on this planet; yet even
then both would presumably be capable of improvement. Any person who
admits this obvious proposition is by law incapable of teaching in a
State school. Thus the law decrees that the teachers shall all be either
hypocrites or fools.
The growing danger exemplified by the New York law is that resulting
"from the monopoly of power in the hands of a single organization,"
whether the State or a Trust or federation of Trusts. In the case of
"education, the power is in the hands of the State, which can prevent the"
young from hearing of any doctrine which it dislikes. I believe there
are still some people who think that a democratic State is scarcely
"distinguishable from the people. This, however, is a delusion. The State"
"is a collection of officials, different for different purposes, drawing"
comfortable incomes so long as the _status quo_ is preserved. The only
alteration they are likely to desire in the _status quo_ is an increase
"of bureaucracy and of the power of bureaucrats. It is, therefore,"
natural that they should take advantage of such opportunities as war
"excitement to acquire inquisitorial powers over their employees,"
involving the right to inflict starvation upon any subordinate who
"opposes them. In matters of the mind, such as education, this state of"
affairs is fatal. It puts an end to all possibility of progress or
freedom or intellectual initiative. Yet it is the natural result of
allowing the whole of elementary education to fall under the sway of a
single organization.
"Religious toleration, to a certain extent, has been won because people"
have ceased to consider religion so important as it was once thought to
"be. But in politics and economics, which have taken the place formerly"
"occupied by religion, there is a growing tendency to persecution, which"
is not by any means confined to one party. The persecution of opinion in
Russia is more severe than in any capitalist country. I met in Petrograd
reason; they have reached the heights of spiritual exaltation; they
have seen and felt as minds more calm and rational can never see nor
feel.
"And the ancient Greeks, had not they too the gift of ecstasy, the"
faculty to soar above facts on the wings of imagination? When the drama
of Demeter and Kore was played before the eyes of the initiated at
"Eleusis, were not they too uplifted in mind until amid the magic of"
night they were no longer spectators of a drama but themselves had a
share in Demeter’s sorrow and wandering and joy? For the pagan story
is not unlike the Christian story in its power to move both tears and
"gladness. As now men mourn beside the bier of Christ, so in old time"
may men have shared Demeter’s mourning for her child who though divine
had suffered the lot of men and passed away to the House of Hades. As
"now men rejoice when they behold the risen Christ, so in old time may"
men have shared Demeter’s joy when her child returned from beneath the
"earth, proving that there is life beyond the grave. But the old story"
"taught more than this. Not only did Kore live in the lower world, but"
her passing thither was not death but wedding. Therefore just as now
"the resurrection of Christ, who though divine is the representative of"
"mankind, is held to be an earnest of man’s resurrection, so the wedded"
life of Kore in the nether world may have been to the initiated an
assurance of the same bliss to be vouchsafed to them hereafter.
What was there then in this drama of Demeter and Kore at which the
Christian writers could take offence or cavil? We do not of course
know in what detail the story was represented; but the pivot on which
the whole plot turned was necessarily the rape of Kore. Now it appears
that in the play the part of Aïdoneus was taken by an hierophant and
the part of Kore by a priestess; and it was the alleged indecency
resulting therefrom which the fathers of the Church most severely
"censured. Asterius, after defending the Christians from the charge of"
the coarse by the long action of strong waves and tides. The sands
and clays have undergone little more sorting than is done by
rivers. We must regard the Chemung sandstones as deposits made at
"the mouths of swift, turbid rivers in such great amount that they"
could be little sorted and distributed by waves.
Over considerable areas the Chemung sandstones bear little or no
"trace of the action of the sea. The Catskill Mountains, for"
"example, have as their summit layers some three thousand feet of"
"coarse red sandstones of this series, whose structure is that of"
"river deposits, and whose few fossils are chiefly of fresh-water"
"types. The Chemung is therefore composed of delta deposits, more"
or less worked over by the sea. The bulk of the Chemung equals
that of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. To furnish this immense
"volume of sediment a great mountain range, or highland, must have"
been upheaved where the Appalachian lowland long had been. To what
height the Devonian mountains of Appalachia attained cannot be
"told from the volume of the sediments wasted from them, for they"
may have risen but little faster than they were worn down by
denudation. We may infer from the character of the waste which
they furnished to the Chemung shores that they did not reach an
Alpine height. The grains of the Chemung sandstones are not those
"which would result from mechanical disintegration, as by frost on"
"high mountain peaks, but are rather those which would be left from"
the long chemical decay of siliceous crystalline rocks; for the
more soluble minerals are largely wanting. The red color of much
of the deposits points to the same conclusion. Red residual clays
"accumulated on the mountain sides and upland summits, and were"
washed as ocherous silt to mingle with the delta sands. The iron-
bearing igneous rocks of the oldland also contributed by their
"decay iron in solution to the rivers, to be deposited in films of"
"iron oxide about the quartz grains of the Chemung sandstones,"
"blood, as the principle of life, was no longer supposed to renew physical"
"energy, but to cause a temporary or even an eternal rebirth of the soul."
"The descent into the pit was regarded as burial, a melancholy dirge"
accompanied the burial of the old man who had died. When he emerged
purified of all his crimes by the sprinkling of blood and raised to a new
"life, he was regarded as the equal of a god, and the crowd worshiped him"
from a respectful distance.[36]
The vogue obtained in the Roman empire by the practice of this repugnant
rite can only be explained by the extraordinary power ascribed to it. He
"who submitted to it was _in aeternum renatus_,[37] according to the"
inscriptions.
"We could also outline the transformation of other Phrygian ceremonies, of"
which the spirit and sometimes the letter slowly changed under the
influence of more advanced moral ideas. This is true of the sacred feasts
attended by the initiates. One of the few liturgic formulas antiquity has
"left us refers to these Phrygian banquets. One hymn says: ""I have eaten"
"from the tambourine, I have drunk from the cymbal, I have become a mystic"
"of Attis."" The banquet, which is found in several Oriental religions, was"
sometimes simply the {69} external sign indicating that the votaries of the
"same divinity formed one large family. Admitted to the sacred table, the"
neophyte was received as the guest of the community and became a brother
among brothers. The religious bond of the thiasus or _sodalicium_ took the
"place of the natural relationship of the family, the gens or the clan, just"
as the foreign religion replaced the worship of the domestic hearth.
Sometimes other effects were expected of the food eaten in common. When the
"flesh of some animal supposed to be of a divine nature was eaten, the"
votary believed that he became identified with the god and that he shared
in his substance and qualities. In the beginning the Phrygian priests
probably attributed the first of these two meanings to their barbarous
"associated with the name of Hegel. Hegel takes experience, knowledge,"
"or thought, in another and much more comprehensive fashion than did his"
"predecessors. Knowledge, in fact, is all-comprehending; it embraces"
"both sides in itself, and explains them as 'moments,' _i.e._"
complementary factors in the one Reality. To make this clearer: we have
"been all along taking knowledge as a dualistic process, as having two"
"sides involved in it, a subject and an object. Now, Hegel says our"
mistake is this: we cannot make a separation of such a kind except by a
"process of abstraction: the one really implies the other, and could not"
"possibly exist without it. We may in our ordinary pursuits do so,"
without doubt; we may concentrate our attention on one side or the
"other, as the case may be; we may look at the world as if it could be"
"explained by mechanical means, as, indeed, to a certain point it can."
"But, Hegel says, these explanations are not sufficient; they can easily"
"be shown to be untrue, when driven far enough: the world is something"
"larger; it has the ideal side as well as the real, and, as we are"
"placed, they are both necessarily there, and must both be recognised,"
if we are to attain to true conceptions.
Without saying that Ferrier wholly assimilated the modern German
"view,--for of course he did not,--he was clearly largely influenced by"
"it, more largely perhaps than he was even himself aware. It"
particularly met the present difficulties with which he was confronted.
"The negative attitude was felt to be impossible, and the other, the"
"Belief which then, as now, was so strongly advocated, the Belief which"
meant a more or less blind acceptance of a spiritual power beyond our
"own, the Belief in the God we cannot know and glory in not being able"
"so to know, he felt to be an equal impossibility. Ferrier, and many"
"others, asked the question, Are these alternatives exhaustive? Can we"
not have a rational explanation of the world and of ourselves? Can we
"not, that is, attain to freedom? The new point of view seemed in some"
"measure to meet the difficulty, and therefore it was looked to with"
divinities who had achieved full naturalization and had been placed on the
"official list of gods, were adopted by the populations of the Occident as"
Roman gods together with the rest. This propagation was clearly different
"from that of any other Oriental religion, for here the action of the"
government aided the tendencies that attracted the devout masses to these
Asiatic divinities.
This popular zeal was the result of various causes. Ancient authors
describe the impression produced upon the masses by those magnificent
"processions in which Cybele passed along on her car, preceded by musicians"
"playing captivating melodies, by priests wearing gorgeous costumes covered"
"with amulets, and by the long line of votaries and members of the"
"fraternities, all barefoot and wearing their insignia. All this, however,"
"created only a fleeting and exterior impression upon the neophyte, but as"
soon as he entered the temple a deeper sensation took hold of him. He heard
the pathetic story of the goddess seeking the body of her lover cut down in
the prime of his life like the grass of the fields. He saw the bloody
"funeral services in which the cruel death of the young man was mourned,"
"{59} and heard the joyful hymns of triumph, and the gay songs that greeted"
his return to life. By a skilfully arranged gradation of feelings the
onlookers were uplifted to a state of rapturous ecstasy. Feminine devotion
"in particular found encouragement and enjoyment in these ceremonies, and"
"the Great Mother, the fecund and generous goddess, was always especially"
worshiped by the women.
"Moreover, people founded great hopes on the pious practice of this"
"religion. Like the Thracians, the Phrygians began very early to believe in"
the immortality of the soul. Just as Attis died and came to life again
"every year, these believers were to be born to new life after their death."
"One of the sacred hymns said: ""Take courage, oh mystics, because the god is"
"saved; and for you also will come salvation from your trials.""[21] Even the"
funeral ceremonies were affected by the strength of that belief. In some
"action, for he had always regarded learning as a pastime rather than a"
"drudgery, and so had easily distanced his comrades in the race for"
knowledge. While they were flirting with the Lischen or Gretchen of the
"hour, he had willingly absorbed himself in study--thus he had attained"
"the head of his classes with scarce an effort, and, in fact, had often"
found time hanging heavily on his hands for want of something more to
do. He had astonished the university professors--but he had not
"astonished himself, inasmuch as no special branch of learning presented"
"any difficulties to him, and the more he mastered the more dissatisfied"
he became. It had seemed such a little thing to win the honors of
scholarship! for at that time his ambition was always climbing up the
"apparently inaccessible heights of fame,--fame, that he then imagined"
was the greatest glory any human being could aspire to. He smiled as he
"recollected this, and thought how changed he was since then! What a"
"difference between the former discontented mutability of his nature,"
"and the deep, unswerving calm of patience that characterized it now!"
Learning and scholarship? these were the mere child's alphabet of
"things,--and fame was a passing breath that ruffled for one brief"
moment the on-rushing flood of time--a bubble blown in the air to break
"into nothingness. Thus much wisdom he had acquired,--and what more? A"
great deal more! he had won the difficult comprehension of HIMSELF; he
had grasped the priceless knowledge that man has no enemy save THAT
"WHICH IS WITHIN HIM, and that the pride of a rebellious Will is the"
parent Sin from which all others are generated. The old Scriptural
"saying is true for all time, that through pride the angels fell; and it"
is only through humility that they will ever rise again. Pride! the
"proud Will that is left FREE by Divine Law, to work for itself and"
"answer for itself, and wreak upon its own head the punishment of its"
"own errors,--the Will that once voluntarily crushed down, in the dust"
"at the Cross of Christ, with these words truly drawn from the depths of"
"penitence, ""Lord, not as I will, but as Thou wilt!"" is straightway"
"lifted up from its humiliation, a supreme, stately Force, resistless,"
"the light, and tramped back to the shore. Scarcely had she gained the"
"mainland, when, glancing seawards, she saw the light sway from side"
"to side for a second or two, and then make a dive into the water. A"
few moments later a crash reverberated above the noise of the storm:
"the decrepit pier had succumbed at last. Hers was a lucky escape, but"
"she hurried home, and sat by the main light gleaming from her roof all"
"that night, apprehensive that some vessel might endeavour to make the"
"harbour and come to grief. When the pier was rebuilt, a new beacon"
"was placed on its extremity, but its upkeep was taken over by the"
"harbour authorities, leaving only the shore light in the trusty woman’s"
"keeping, the wicks of which for over forty years were trimmed and lit"
"at dusk, and extinguished with the dawn, with her own hands."
During the migratory season of the birds extraordinary sights are
witnessed around the light at night. The brilliant glare attracts
"enormous flocks, which flit to and fro. As the monster flaming spoke"
"swings round, the birds, evidently blinded by the glare, dash with such"
fury against the glass panes of the lantern as to flutter to the floor
"of the gallery with broken necks and wings, while large numbers, dazed"
"or killed, fall into the water. The birds are of all species, and at"
times may be picked up by the basketful. Then the light-keepers are
"able to secure a welcome change in their dietary. Moths, too, often"
"hover in clouds round the light, and are of such variety that an hour"
on the gallery would bring infinite delight and rich harvests to the
youthful entomologist who has to be content to hunt around electric
lamps in quiet streets at night.
"While the lamp is burning, time cannot drag, owing to the multitude"
of details which compel the keeper’s constant attention. The official
"log has to be kept posted with a host of facts, such as temperature,"
"barometric readings, weather conditions as they vary from hour to"
"hour, behaviour of the lamps, etc.; while, when the lighthouse is"
"need of purity, a conclusive refutation. But instinct did not deceive"
"his adversaries, when it told them that doctrine itself was at stake if"
the linguistic judgement of a single individual might decide as to the
correct version of a text. And Erasmus wished to avoid the inferences
which assailed doctrine. He was not aware of the fact that his
"conceptions of the Church, the sacraments and the dogmas were no longer"
"purely Catholic, because they had become subordinated to his"
"philological insight. He could not be aware of it because, in spite of"
"all his natural piety and his fervent ethical sentiments, he lacked the"
mystic insight which is the foundation of every creed.
It was this personal lack in Erasmus which made him unable to understand
the real grounds of the resistance of Catholic orthodoxy. How was it
"possible that so many, and among them men of high consideration, refused"
to accept what to him seemed so clear and irrefutable! He interpreted
"the fact in a highly personal way. He, the man who would so gladly have"
"lived in peace with all the world, who so yearned for sympathy and"
"recognition, and bore enmity with difficulty, saw the ranks of haters"
and opponents increase about him. He did not understand how they feared
"his mocking acrimony, how many wore the scar of a wound that the _Moria_"
had made. That real and supposed hatred troubled Erasmus. He sees his
enemies as a sect. It is especially the Dominicans and the Carmelites
who are ill-affected towards the new scientific theology. Just then a
new adversary had arisen at Louvain in the person of his compatriot
"Nicholas of Egmond, prior of the Carmelites, henceforth an object of"
particular abhorrence to him. It is remarkable that at Louvain Erasmus
"found his fiercest opponents in some compatriots, in the narrower sense"
"of the word: Vincent Dirks of Haarlem, William of Vianen, Ruurd Tapper."
The persecution increases: the venom of slander spreads more and more
every day and becomes more deadly; the greatest untruths are impudently
"preached about him; he calls in the help of Ath, the vice-chancellor,"
against them. But it is no use; the hidden enemies laugh; let him write
"for exploiting applications of knowledge, not so often for saving as"
"for destruction. In the absence of some power of restraint, civilisation"
is trembling in an unstable poise on the brink of ruin. Some
complementary ideal there must be to save man from that mad rush which
must end in disaster. He has followed the lure and excitement of some
"insatiable ambition, never pausing for a moment to think of the ultimate"
object for which success was to serve as a temporary incentive. He
forgot that far more potent than competition was mutual help and
co-operation in the scheme of life. And in this country through
"milleniums, there always have been some who, beyond the immediate and"
"absorbing prize of the hour, sought for the realisation of the highest"
"ideal of life--not through passive renunciation, but through active"
"struggle. The weakling who has refused the conflict, having acquired"
"nothing has nothing to renounce. He alone who has striven and won, can"
enrich the world by giving away the fruits of his victorious experience.
In India such examples of constant realisation of ideals through work
have resulted in the formation of a continuous living tradition. And by
her latent power of rejuvenescence she has readjusted herself through
infinite transformations. Thus while the soul of Babylon and the Nile
"Valley have transmigrated, ours still remains vital and with capacity of"
"absorbing what time has brought, and making it one with itself."
"The ideal of giving, of enriching, in fine, of self-renunciation in"
response to the highest call of humanity is the other and complementary
ideal. The motive power for this is not to be found in personal ambition
"but in the effacement of all littlenesses, and uprooting of that"
ignorance which regards anything as gain which is to be purchased at
"others' loss. This I know, that no vision of truth can come except in"
"the absence of all sources of distraction, and when the mind has reached"
the point of rest.
"Public life, and the various professions will be the appropriate spheres"
in the dream itself as in that substratum of it which has not passed the
threshold and which analysis alone can bring to light.'
'We only dream of things that are worth while.' That is the point at
which many of us are no longer able to follow Freud. That dreams of the
type studied by Freud do actually occur may be accepted; it may even be
considered proved. But to assert that all dreams must be made to fit
into this one formula is to make far too large a demand. As regards the
presentative element in dreams--the element that is based on actual
sensory stimulation--it is in most cases unreasonable to invoke Freud's
"formula at all. If, when I am asleep, the actual song of a bird causes me"
"to dream that I am at a concert, that picture may be regarded as a natural"
"symbol of the actual sensation, and it is unreasonable to expect that"
psycho-analysis could reveal any hidden personal reason why the symbol
"should take the form of a concert. And, if so, then Freud's formula fails"
to hold good for phenomena which cover one of the two main divisions of
"dreams, even on a superficial classification, and perhaps enter into all"
dreams.
But even if we take dreams of the remaining or representative class--the
dreams made up of images not directly dependent on actual sensation--we
still have to maintain a cautious attitude. A very large proportion of the
"dreams in this class seem to be, so far as the personal life is concerned,"
"in no sense 'worth while.' It would, indeed, be surprising if they were."
"It seems to be fairly clear that in sleep, as certainly in the hypnagogic"
"state, attention is diminished, and apperceptive power weakened. That"
alone seems to involve a relaxation of the tension by which we will and
"desire our personal ends. At the same time, by no longer concentrating our"
psychic activities at the focus of desire it enables indifferent images to
enter more easily the field of sleeping consciousness. It might even be
"argued that the activity of desire, when it manifests itself in sleep and"
"follows the course indicated by Freud, corresponds to a special form of"

I'm watching it now.
What is the connection to the deaths of James Bone and Tino Zapatti?
"What was Santos doing with $40,000?"
The mayor understands the implications of the discovery in Ulster County but would like to stress that these are implications only.
Can you believe this shit?
We never set foot in that dump after Eddie's father died.
-lt's full of hornets' nests.
"-Yeah, busy hornets."
Never in our life did we see $4000 cash...
... muchless40 .
There's only two people know that's not Eddie 's money.
You and me.
Who is this?
Vinnie Zapatti.
I can get you out of this.
"I can get you the pension, the medals."
You want them?
"Sure, sure, I want them."
Good.
"Now, I liked Eddie  andI wannahelpyou , but you gotta help me."
What's that mean?
"An airplane ticket and $ 10,000."
"$1 0,000!"
"For God's sake, I can't--"
-A lot of money!
What've you got?
-Who are you?

Disappeared without a trace.

But her apartment was under constant surveillance.
"They made sure nobody entered, not whether someone left."
"She was gone, when the replacement came."
I don't get it.
Why leave our protection and put herself in danger?
I didn't get it at first either.
Until this arrived.
What is it?
The Hiromitsu file.
It took our colleagues in NewYork sometime to find out who the pseudonym was.
"As it turns out, he didn't commitsuicide"
"- Ben, don't."
"I know you. 0nce you get worked up, you start a fight."
Will you come to the market with us tomorrow?

"LOOK, SAM, I-I KNOW YOU WANTED TO TRY THAT CASE,"
"AND I RESPECT YOU FOR THAT,"
That's the one.
He was convinced that the Holy Grail was there.
For the love of Christ.
"Yes, he was looking for that too, don't doubt it."
"-The Nazis believed in the power of relics, the lance with which Longinus pierced Christ or the Arc of the Covenant."
I've heard of that.
Someone wants to rewrite history and we won't allow it.
"Ernesto, you speak German."
You should go immediately with Irene to Madrid in the 40s.
and find out what Himmler wants.
I suppose he'll be staying at the Ritz.
"Yes, that hasn't changed."
For the moment.

"So, is thatyour new I.D.?"
Yep.
I could get into the White House pressroom with these documents.

[WOMAN SINGING IN FRENCH]
You like?
What is there not to like?
Who is she?
Her name's Lin.
Her father was chief of the Hang Pham Province.
Until he refused to cooperate with the Viet Cong.
- And then they killed him?
- They murdered him.
And her little brother.
In a most hideous way.
That's their style.
Besides being one of our top models she could be most helpful to our government.
"Are you trying to tell me something, colonel?"
That gentleman seated with her.
He's a double agent.
He works for us and for General Pham Son Ti.
"Then tell me, colonel who will she be helpful to?"
[SINGING]
"Colonel Morgan, there's a big buildup around Camp A-107."
It could be the real thing.
They've requested tac air and a flare ship.
MORGAN:
That's fine.
Keep us informed.
Captain MacDaniel had a word for you.
Butthatwas a mistake.
The White House was full of Kennedy people then.
Itstill is.
- Who do you think's behind this?
"- Well, you have C.I.A. People all overthis place."
Helms has seen to that.
And then there's Kissinger's staff.
"Kissinger himself, I believe, may be the leaker."
- Kissinger?
- He's obsessed with his own image.
He wants his Nobel peace prize a little too much.
"And as the late Dr. King proved, even an ape can win a prize with good press."
"Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office."
"He comes in here ranting and raving,"
- dumping his crap all overthe place.
- [Laughing]
"Could you prove it, Edgar?"
"Mr. President, I always getmy man."
"Yeah, you do."
This damn tie.
- Could you help me?
- Yeah.
"See, I'd be bugging myself."
Who'd getthe tapes?
No one.
Your property.
And itwould prove your case.
Why do you think Kissinger is taping allyour calls?
For history.
Hmm?
His word againstyours.
And right now...
He never went anywhere without it.
It's missing.

Remember that promise you made to Kevin Whitfield's parents?
You want to make good on it?
What do you know about Kevin Whitfield?
Just what you told me back then.
I've been going over it.
"You know, uh, the backpack that was missing."
You thought it was connected to the killing.
Are you reading my notes?
"I, uh, I took a picture of it, and I sent it to my friends."
They did some kind of search.
"You know, like the dents and scratches on the backpack make it like a fingerprint?"
Did you know that?
[Beeping]
They looked at 5 million pictures and finally came up with the perfect match.
"One double-bacon BLT sandwich, nice and hot."
Thank you.

SHE MIGHT HAVE FORGOTTEN SOMETHING.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO GET THOSE DOCUMENTS
TO LUCY FOR YOUR FAKE I.D.
"YEAH, I'LL DO IT LATER."
"SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW, SAM?"
"ABOUT WHAT, FI?"
ABOUT WHY MICHAEL'S ACTING THIS WAY.
WHAT WAY?
HE SEEMS FINE TO ME.
TELL ME ABOUT THIS NEW CLIENT.
"YOU KNOW, I JUST REMEMBERED."
"I'VE GOT TO GET MIKE SOME YOGURT,"
"'CAUSE IF I DON'T DO THAT, BOY, YOU KNOW HOW HE IS."
HE NEVER MENTIONED TROUBLE AT WORK.
DO YOU THINK THERE COULD BE A CONNECTION?
COULD BE.
"YOU HEAR ATF INVESTIGATION, IT RAISES FLAGS."
I WISH I COULD BE MORE HELPFUL.
SORRY.
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST FOCUS ON GETTING YOUR SON BACK.
THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH IT.
"EVELYN, I THINK YOU'RE STRONGER THAN YOU REALIZE."
THEN MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE JUST STUCK WITH IT.
"YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED"
IF I HAD PRETENDED THAT EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT?
"BUT I DIDN'T WANT MY FAMILY TO BE A LIE,"

We will explain.
If we need to find Ashwini...
We need some details about her.
Since when do you know Ashwini?
Recently...
Not too long ago...
She came to see my sculptures.
We became friends.
You said Ashwini was an NRI?
Yes.
From Singapore.
She has some ancestral property near Nagercoil.
She had come to sell it.
Was she staying with you?
At first she was staying outside.
As we got closer...
She came here and stayed with me.
I was happy every single moment that I spent with her.
She loved me as well.
But everything turned up-side-down in one night.
Maybe Ashwini has gone back to Singapore.

"They've been arrested several times, but never convicted."
Morty Price has been with Cannata and Doss since they began working in Las Vegas.
Dorothy Bain is the question mark.
"Except, we think we know why she might have killed Morty Price."
Annie said Dorothy told her stories about... being beaten by her husband back in New York.

-He must think I'm dead.
- lt's one ofthe tricks ofthis trade.
What's that?
"-Did you summon me, comrade mayor?"
-Yes I did.
The talk is to remain between you and me only.
The Malyutin company is to be reinforced with experienced soldiers
"- but there remained veryfew ofthem, right?"
"-Yes, sir."
So you'll augment the companywith the ones who have already been sentenced.
- ls everything clearto you?
"-Yes, everything is clear."
-But I do not have the right to fulfil your order.
- Theywill be sent on a mission that will nicely replace a firing squad.
"You know perfectlywell, Sergei Pavlovich, who can give me such orders..."
Damn the rules!
"You have changed a lot recently, comrade mayor!"
I'm sending my best soldiers out to this mission
- You worry too much.
"All our patients get VIP treatment, Bick."
God is blessed.
"- Hello, Arthur."
- Ah.
Owen.
I heard you were here getting your second cycle of temozolomide.
Yes.
"Yes, I finished my last fraction of radiation one month ago."
And look at you.
You look terrific.
"Well, uh..."
The therapy is working beautifully.
Uh... the last brain scan showed...
no tumor enhancement.
"- That's wonderful, news."
- Mm-hmm.
"- Now, is there any dizziness, fatigue,"
- No.
Weakness... seizure activity?
No to all three.
I feel like a new man.
"And if I, uh, may ask, h-how's the, uh, reconciliation going?"
"My son, Peter, he's forgiven me."
I plan to use every day I've got left to make up for the ones I wasn't here.
"Okay, now, as a fellow doctor, you'll be interested in this."
We have a new medication that we can add to your treatment regimen.
What is it?
It's experimental.
Valganciclovir.
The antiviral?
Mm-hmm.
"You said you all moved to Paris, but Mom said your parents died back in Algeria."
Papa died 12 years ago and Mama died two months later-.
12 years?
We had grandparents until 12 years ago?
Why didn't we meet them?
Your mom shunned them until they died.
"She didn't speak to them, only to me."
"Aunt Rosa, where's Maurice?"
Please tell us.
Do you know who Isabelle Moretti is?
- The actress?
- Yes.
Talk to her.
- What does she have to do with Maurice?
- She knew him.
Look her up and talk to her.
"This isn't Hollywood, she's just an actress-."
Now leave me alone.
Who are you talking about?
Why should we talk to Moretti?
Why can't you tell us?
"- I don't want to, okay?"
- Why not?
Who are they talking about?
"About Madame Isabelle Moretti, no more and no less."
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.
We start with Romeo and Juliet and end up with Isabelle Moretti.
"Suddenly Mom jumps out of windows, has abortions, she's a Communist."
I don't know who you're talking about but it sure isn't my mother.
And to top it off you invent grandparents.
Great.
She says it's reductive.
But I think it's a compliment.
"I mean, gypsies are all the rage on TV --"

"All right, so, we got what appears to be Wayne McNut's hair and..."
a bag full of weird.
"In Romanichal culture, the pouch is called a putsi bag."
It's used for hexes.
"Okay, so, what?"
Mala's putting hexes on hubby's competition?
"Our message is about peace, love and universal harmony."
Loser!
And about finding balance and cosmic energy through Zenovation.
- Open up your minds to a new reality.
- Losers!
- Screw harmony and peace.
- And that chi stuff.
This is just too easy.
"- Thank you, sir."
- Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
"And the pictures of the kids, your family, nice people."
"Hey, mind if I wear this?"
You got any tickets to the policemen ball?
"Well, guys, you ready?"
Okay.
- We're back.
- We're back.
What happened yesterday was our fault.
- Un-American.
- Un-Pennsylvanian.
- Un-Charlestownonian.

This town needs a good punch in the nose.

Were you working the night of the assault?
You were here?
Yes.

And it appears to have trace amounts... of aconite.
- Aconite?
- Monkshood.
Wolf's bane.
"A poison, Mr. Porter."
"Not enough to kill you, but certainly enough to have rather unpleasant effects... on your mind."
- Congratulations.
You found us.
One final test... for your commitment.
Who do you see?
- Margaret.
- And why do you think she's here?
"- She whispered lies into my mind, sowed doubts within me."
She tried to turn me against you.
"- No, Isabel."

Cleanse her with the lash.
Her screams will be her sacrament of reconciliation.

What you do remember?
"I remember it made me happy to be here,"
"On this ship,"
With you.
"On the other hand,"
"Andromeda, rommie, doyle... i don't even know what to call myself."
I'll tell you what.
Why don't i just call you... friend.

Not at all!

It's like paradise!
Such a big man and he's still sucking breasts
Looks like it's so pleasurable
Heavenly!
Look at the way he waggles his tongue
This is so embarrassing
What's so embarrassing about that?
Don't come if you're broke
This is so wonderful!
"Master Zhou, you've had your pleasure!"
"Let's play the money game, how's that?"
Good!

"Why you put up ""Sold""?"
Because it is sold to another party.
"A shoe company, Axel."
"They wanted a bigger area, but--"
No.
You cannot.
Now you listen to me.
I warned you I couldn't wait.
"I'd be a fool to, particularly after that check bounced."
Like I told the church committee--
"Wait, wait."
Bounced?
What check bounced?
"That personal check for 50,000 from Somers."
"I wanted to tell you about it the day I talked to you, but she didn't want me to."
She?
Your friend from Beverly Hills.
"Axel, I know Miss Morrow's done quite a good promotion job."
At least she sure did sweep everybody around here off their feet.
"If you got something inside, say it."
Don't make up the words.
I tried to get hold of her all day.
Best I could do was a lot of messages she was tied up someplace.
"Tied up, my foot."
My wife saw her car parked at a bar down the highway not more than two hours ago.

Can I see you for a moment?
Excuse us.
I can't take it anymore.
"I know you love me, I do, but I am drowning in it."
"Sweetie, I think we-"
Shh!
Who does this?
It's like...
"On our birthdays, I got you a sweater."
You had a plane skywriting for me-
"Seriously, this just-"
Shh!
And it's not just the big days.
It's every day.
Cute little notes under my pillow.
And in the refrigerator.
And in my diaphragm case.
"Oh, I-"
It is too much.
And I don't think there is a woman in the world who would disagree with me!
"God, I would."
- Excuse me?
"- Oh, but..."
I
- I'm sorry.
It's-but
"- Everything you just said sounded really, really nice."
"I mean, seriously, if I had someone doing amazing, travagant things for me every day, I"
- I think I'd just shut up.

So you have any biblical parables on hand for unrepentant grifters?

-My goodness.
You are even more impressive than your reputation.
Yeah?
Well... .
My daughter-in-law believes that Mr. Wingo's charges may be false.
I wanna know why Mr. Wingo would cause...
... hisproperty to be discovered on you.
Well?
What will happen to me if I'm found guilty?
-Are you saying the charges are true?
-Definitely not.
travis:
"Madam, get yourself in hand."
Mr. Jackson's going on trial for murder.
I don't have any time for horseplay.
Mr. Wingo is adamant that you stole his property.
And you are equally adamant that you did not.
"I wanna know the truth, and I wanna know it quickly."
"Ezra, are you acting as my attorney or not?"
Not so long as you leave me in the dark.
"Ezra, take care of this."
I got a trial to convene.
Good day.
"My, my, my, judge."

Exactly.
John Garfield.
"People tell you that, Father?"
Do people tell you you look like Paul Newman?
Always.
"Well, you know this director who was doing the film here Burke Dennings?"
I've seen him.
You've seen him.
You're also familiar how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
"Father, what do you know on the subject of witchcraft?"
"From the witching end, not the hunting."
I once did a paper on it.
Really?
From the psychiatric end.
I know.
I read it.
All of this desecration in the church do you think this has anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe.
"Some rituals used in the black mass, maybe."
And now Dennings.
You read how he died?
In a fall.
Let me tell you how.
"And please, Father confidential."
"Burke Dennings, good Father was found at the bottom of those steps leading to M Street with his head turned completely around facing backwards."
Didn't happen in the fall?
It's possible.
"-Possible, however--"
-Unlikely.
Exactly.
"Because we got a long session coming out, trying to figure who's sitting on his last bomb at this very minute."
"Now, whether you know it or not, one of you three people has got the answer."

Obediah's people rose up.

Will you at least take a look?
- Check out your brains first
You talk of traveling by Eurail?
"If he hears, he'll bring the roof down"
A lone girl mustn't travel like this.
I can't believe I chickened out.
It's okay B.
This is the beginning of something new.
Now we can all move on.
The possibilities are endless after all.
Yes.
To great things.
And so what if i'm not going to yale?
you were recently incarcerated
And I'm afraid to talk to Chuck because he might hurt me again.
This is our moment.
Nobody can take that from us.
I urge you to go out into the world
And show them who you have become.
Not so fast.
You're not graduating until I give you my diplomas.
Mine are labels and labels stick.
Nate Archibald-- class whore.
Dan Humphrey-- the ultimate insider.
Chuck Bass--coward.
Blair Waldorf--weakling.
And as for Serena Van der Woodsen
After today you are officially irrelevant.
- O.M.G.
- I know.
Congratulations everyone.
You deserve it.
Now please join me in welcoming the class of 2009.
Class please stand.
You were right B.
Nobody can take this day away from us.
Gossip girl is going down.
The Baroness is served.
Take the princess' arm.
I will follow you.
What a beautiful couple you would make.
Come in.
"Madam, Mr Barbey and another gentleman are here."
They ask if you can receive them in spite of the late hour.
Of course.
I'm coming.
- You will excuse me.
- You're welcome.
"Let me introduce you to Mr Nanteuil, my new partner."
"Good evening, Mr."
Madam.
"Excuse my tardiness, Baroness, please."
Mr Nanteuil is a French Canadian.
"With the capitals he brought, my bank, our bank, is now the first private bank in Paris."
"I am very happy for you, Mr Barbey."
You will therefore find it easier to give me the money I asked.
"Unfortunately, no."
It is no longer the same operation.
"I do not know how to say this, but you are completely ruined."
This is the sad language of numbers.
But it is not possible.
"Your hotel, your cars,"
your home...
- But...
- You must leave everything.
Which Baroness?
"De Vibray, Mr Commissioner."
"His patron of the arts, somehow."
Ah!
"With three kinds of heat, you can cook a turkey... in 22 minutes."
Wow.
That is impressive.
The people upstairs think so.
That's why they promoted me.
That's why they sent me here to retool your show.
"Retool what, now?"
I'm the new Vice President of east-coast television and microwave-oven programming.
That sounds like you program microwave ovens.
I like you.
You have the boldness of a much-younger woman.
"Lee, does my face look bloated to you?"
"When I played that lady rapist on ""Law  Order,"""
guess what the makeup guy put on under my eyes to take the puffiness out.
Hemorrhoid cream.
[Laughs]
"Miss Maroney, I have the cat wrangler here for you."
"Oh, is it that horrible little..."
Hi.
Hey.
Greta Johanssen...
short for Lugreta.
Hi.
Great to see you again.
You too.
I'm here to introduce you to the feline actors you're gonna be working with tonight.
Okay.
This is Poppo.
And this here is Captain Boots.
Hello.
Would you describe yourself as cat-competent?
"Oh, yes."
Thanks.
Bye.
What's up this evening?
- It's Friday.
- Aren't you going home?
- Don't you have to go North?
- It's already Friday?
Then I'II see you on Monday.
silvia?
Surprise!
"Hi, little guy."
- See?
There's ciaparatt.
- Who's ciaparatt?
"We invited a few friends, Iet's go."
tell us about the hell you're going through down there.
"Just looking at them, they seem normal, but in reality they're dark, stocky."
No one's in the office in the mornings.
"About 11:30 they show up, at 2 off to the beach."
"With that heat, no one wants to work."
Do the women wearG-strings undertheirbIack dresses?
- And hygiene?
- They're dirty.
There was the start of a cholera epidemic!
It's endemic there.
Tomorrow I'm taking you and Chicco forvaccinations.
"I've already had them, the Red Cross came, you don't fool with cholera."
I worked in the South and I have wonderful memories.
I fell forit!
"My dearbrothers, I've brought you a small gift."
"The ""big tit"" of BattipagIia."
That's five kilos.
I want to see this.
"You coming, Quute?"
"- What about the tunnel, sir?"
- Blow every charge now.
(Beeping)
"You were right, Tarrant."
That was the monorail.
Let's move.
Put down your guns.
Servalan!
Now!
"You see, I told you, Quute."
"They're marvellous fighters, especially at close quarters."
She got away.
"It was Servalan, wasn't it?"
"Well, we both saw her, and she seemed to recognise us."
Tarrant to Scorpio.
We're ready for teleport.
About time.
Stand by to teleport.
"Slave, where are those cruisers now?"
"Sector 12, Master."
You outmanoeuvred them with consummate skill.
Thank you.
"Set a direct course for base, maximum speed."
Teleport operating.
What are you smirking about?
Do you realise we've got half the Federation battle fleet looking for us?
"The next time either of you pull a stunt like that, I warn you it may prove fatal."
We've just seen an old friend of yours.
- An implacable old friend.
- Servalan.
Can you find it?
- Sure.
Give me 10 minutes.
Let me find now.
- Excellent.
- Hello?
"- Tool as a chartered company, consisting of religious statues a church in Los Angeles sent a large transport."
- Religious statues?
- Yes. 20 statue of the Virgin Mary.
But that address is sent to control a church in Los Angeles and I do not have such a church.
Tool company steeped in a bad way.
Even if this guy 5 cents there.
"House for sale was removed, his wife, the divorce lawsuit."
Çırpınıyormuş for the money this man.
- Someone must have paid kickbacks to him.
- Never been bribed.
- I rented the corporate bullshit.
I've never.
- We do not have anything at that time.
"- No, there's something."
- What is it?
Virgin lost 20.
- This is a bad thing?
- I think I look açına depends.
"- Michael, is not it?"
"- Yes, Mike."
"So Mike, this is really a very nice gesture."
- Are you coming to church?
Many familiar come.
- Sometimes I'm coming.
Yes.
"Yes, thank you again."
Rely on it!
That's what my lawyer said.
- You too?
"- No, thanks."
The fine gentleman will pay.
There's still something called fatherhood.
Only the pleasure and no responsibility?
Ha!
"He's here, Mrs John!"
"Where I, in my condition, was made to sit at the bar's cash register..."
No percentages anymore!
"And then, not even the alimony!"
Mr Hassenreuter?
Did you go to the state library?
"Oh certainly, the books!"
"Yes, just a moment, Mrs John!"
- An extra lock?
- And a bolt on the inside!
"As if there was anything to steal from him, Mr Theater Director!"
Without a theater...
He still owes me the rent.
How does he make a living?
"Life, but my lips are sealed..."
"Morning, Mrs John!"
I have something for you.
"Gynecology, midwifery and infant care."
Whether this is the right one for you...
I've been a bachelor all my life.
It's all Greek to me...
"I'll find my way through, Mr Hassenreuter!"
Thank you very much...
What do you want with it?
Great.
Ayushman.
Sometimes I can't decide... who the bigger rascal is.
Doesn't make a difference.
We're both serving the country.
If you're eager on taking a decision... then decide when I'm going to be CP.
I'll sign on your promotion letter... only when your sister and my son... sign on the marriage certificate.
Even I can't decide Mr. Pradhan... who the bigger rascal is.
What to do Ayushman?
My son's heart is set on your sister.
And my son's wish is my command.
On that note let's celebrate at your house today.
Okay.
- Sir.
- What is it?
The police thrashed Vishal.
They threw him down from the multiplex.
What?
What happened Mr. Pradhan.
That police officer whom you appointed... for Ankita's security thrashed Vishal.
Threw him down from the first floor of Galaxy Multiplex.
Zoravar.
Whoever he is.
That midget beat-up Vishal.
I'll look into it.
- Get the car.
- Yes sir.
- Jadhav.
- Yadav sir.
Whatever.
Get me Galaxy Multiplex CCTV footages now.
Yes sir.
Like the disappearance of the Lady Hampshire.
Like love.
Abbs...
"I don't have anything yet, Gibbs."
The computers just got here.
"Well, maybe this stuff will help.; it's all the files we've compiled on the case so far."
What are you doing?
(shutter clicks)
I'm taking a picture of you with my map.
"Trust me, you will thank me later."
"Oh, I know that look."
I like that look.
"The photo of Jarvis and Wickes, where is it?"
"Right here, why?"
What just happened?
Another unexplained phenomena.
"Sometimes, you just have to believe."
Who took the picture?
Haven't we already done this?
VANCE:
"Gibbs, be careful."
RYAN:
The tell.
"Wickes looked at the picture because of who was behind the camera, not in front of it."
"Who took the picture, sir?"
(sighs) Carl Dalton.
He used to go hunting with us.
Does he have a connection to the company?
He's Wickes' half-brother and in-house counsel for Wickes Steel.
DALTON:
"Phillip, what's going on?"
You said you were in trouble?
Fire!
Who's that out there?
What's happening?
Goss.
- Has Defiant been taken?
"- Why, no, sir."
Whose...
Whose voices?
"Mr. Scott-Padget, the captain."
Did Goss tell you?
- I took the Venetians.
- Did we lose many men?
- A dozen or so.
- And wounded:
About threescore.
"Excuse me, I'm needed."
"Before she went down, we took a great deal off her."
"Crates full, en route to France."
But there's a much bigger prize.
Bring in the Frenchman!
"You wouldn't believe it but this figure is Colonel Giraud, a political advisor to Napoleon."
"All right, take him away."
It's fortunate that Colonel Giraud omitted to destroy all his papers.
He knows of plans for the invasion of England.
- Does he know when?
"- Within the next few weeks, sir."
He must be sent to London.
Of course.
"After I make the necessary repairs, we shall make all speed."
- You've done extremely well.
"- Thank you, sir."
"And, Mr. Scott-Padget this crew serves well, if you don't drive them too hard."
Bring up their photos.
The left clavicle on this one is higher than the right.
That's an indication of handedness.
SAROYAN:
"Also, his left deltoid is slightly more developed."
And he parts his hair to the right.
"I mean, most lefties do that."
MONTENEGRO:
Jake Tompkins.
I'll call Booth and let him know.
AUBREY:
"So, this hood isn't exactly screaming ""drug dealer."""
You sure we got the right address?
"Well, Tompkins is not your, you know, usual drug dealer."
He runs a very efficient business.
"Well, I mean, he has to have slipped up somewhere."
Otherwise he wouldn't be in the database.
"Well, he was charged, but he was never convicted, you know?"
"Like I said, he's very careful."
(doorbell ringing)
Yo.
(doorbell rings) (whistles)
Jake Tompkins?
FBI.
Special Agent Seeley Booth.
Special Agent James Aubrey.
How can I help you?
Ask you a few questions.
When was the last time you saw Aldo Clemens?
"Sorry, don't know him."
"Look at the photo, Jake, okay?"
Clemens was found dead this morning.
With an remarkable result.
Imagin this.
"On larger dose, nicely wrapped and shipped to Winston Churchill!"
"Do you understand, we are whats left!"
We are the nations backbone
Or to put it like this.
With our beloved leader.
"""We have alot riding on us, to win the war"""
Sunshine?
"Protection of power plant, and the damms in Southern Norway."
Stop the germans from destroying to much.
Your in charge.
"Poulsson second in command, -"
- Skinnarland as radio operator.
"The rest you choose yourself, congratulation."
I though you wanted to get back in the field.
"If you want to stay here til the war is over and then go back to see your wife and child, thats ok.."
Off course not.
The war is not over.
"-Thanks, sir."
-Bravo.
You wont miss the fish.
No fish with this colour in norway.
No!
", i dont want it"
Its likely very beautiful there this time of year.
Its allways beautiful.
Do you know what i miss the most with Norway?
The View
-Whereever you look.
-Yes.
Starting to be a very long time ago.
Suspected QVapor overdose and psychosis.
Welcome to the Pinky Amusement Park.
Here will be the wettest dream come true!
Get in!
"Commander Bishop, sir?"
- Commander?
"- It's full with Steam, sir!"
"Hey, idiot..."
General Trajano requests your report for the service!
Time to take you home!
Raise it up.
OMG!
"Commander Bishop, are you all right, sir?"
"Do not call me ""sir""!"
"Commercial sector 1, insured."
Prepare 51 for Spartan-7...
Bishop...
"It'll be good to see you again in your uniform, Bishop."
Who says I'm going to put it?
"Come on, we both know, you're not a deserter."
"Find another, for your murders."
You made an oath on Spartan-7.
"Take off your uniform, do not remove the promise."
"Come on, then, arrest me."
All my oaths were broken long ago.
Sorry for Mara.
She was a good woman.
It is difficult to deal with such a thing.
Especially today.
"That's why I brought you here, son."
It's time to get Mara closer.
We told you that your baby died.
You're the murderer the whole empire is out looking for!
"Well, then."
I will go and prepare your dinner now.
The count was really depressed.
Do you suppose he feels responsible?
Is this really a good idea?
Is what?
"Well, the count, he most likely thinks of her as-"
"Yes, he seems to like her!"
And you don't care?
!
Is there something wrong with that?
Asta-san!
Hold on!
Wait for me!
I should've minded my own business!
Your Lordship?
Where are you going?
To find Radu.
You mustn't!
"Out of my way, Terran!"
Why are you so adamant?
!
Eh?
Is there something wrong with me finding Radu and keeping him from assassinating Her Majesty?
!
Your Lordship!
Are you suggesting I want the empress to be assassinated?
!
I'm just...
"I'm just some deplorable, blood-starved monster to you, anyway!"
That's not true!
(Rings)
Lord Meldrum's residence.
Yes.
"Yes, I see."
I will inform her ladyship without delay.
(* Waltz on gramophone)
(Knock at door)
Come in.
"- Excuse me, my lady."
- Shh.
They're on their honeymoon.
lsn't it romantic?
The manager of the pet department at Harrods has just telephoned.
"Apparently, it is very difficult to tell the sex of a parrot."
I'm sure parrots don't make a mistake.
"The manager did, my lady."
He sent you another male parrot.
Really?
"Oh, dear."
"Well, they seem to be managing all right."
"Here you are, Mrs Lipton."
It's the last one.
Oh.
Perhaps I...
I better purée some tomatoes and put them in.
"Ooh, don't use real tomatoes, you'll spoil it."
"Who is coming, exactly?"
"Well, there's Mr Foster the works manager,"
"Mr Barnes the foreman, and that Scotch chap who's the union secretary."
I hope he doesn't make a scene.
"Always envious, those sort of people."
(Ivy) Ooh.
"Okay madam, atleast you bless me!"
I understood.
I understood that all my ties with this house are severed
"Its very simple, sir."
But Krishna understood it today..
..that the poor persons destiny can get generous..
..for sometime but cannot improve forever.
"Excuse me, sir.."
-Get aside.
"Mister, listen to me.."
"- Hey go away, go away."
Its a strange city.
No one listens here.
"Mister, where can I get a place to stay here?"
What?
-A home?
Whats so funny?
"Hey fool, who gave you a ticket to Mumbai?"
I have come without a ticket.
I didnt have the money to buy the ticket.
"Then listen, when I came to Mumbai.."
..even I had asked the same question.
Can I get a place to stay somewhere?
Its been 20 years I still didnt get a reply.
I amjust standing like this on one leg.
"You didnt understand, right?"
Does this city belong to yourfather?
Why dont you think before taking..
..your bags and baggage and coming here?
Enough.
Enough.
Hey.. hey my..
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Come away
# All those years at the back of the queue
# Don't seem real
# All those dreams that were never on view
# We'll reveal
# All we felt that we didn't deserve
# Hand in hand we can summon the nerve
# To feel love
# And give love
# Till those dreams
# Come true
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Nymphs and shepherds come away
# Ah... #
Can I borrow your phone.
I have to make a call.
"Shit, someone's coming."
"Shit, they're shooting."
No ...
Henning ...
What are you ...
Henning?
Do not tell anyone.
"I'm not gay, you know?"
You heard something that seemed shots?
"No, not really."
I could not hear anything with the helmet.
We were wondering if Henning had not killed.
Four members of Ferrymen were murdered tonight.
"One of them was my informant,"
He will shoot himself.
"Shut up, You don't talk much."
"I will kill you first, Come over here."
"No, No, It's Ok, I am normal than you."
Go and buy the famous battery from Bhaiya's Shop.
"I don't have change, Change..."
"Take it from me, but bring it quick."
Pintos!
"Why you're doing all day Pintos, Mintos, Lintos?"
"You just add S,"
You add S on every single word and English word.
"People have one father in this world and I have 550,000 Fathers."
Right!
"Papa, you don't have to do like this, What else?"
Hey!
I will give you a slap.
"My Papa add S, It's not your concern,"
"I'll beat you here, Pintos!"
"I bring you from street, from orphanage."
"I gave him clothes,"
"Did I gave you application, that bring me up."
"Father died in darkness, and son is power house."
Here's your clothes.
"You dramatic, you hits me this clothes in publicly, anywhere."
"Hits me anywhere, Pintos!"
"Listen to me, Yes!"
Did you buy it from Pahar Ganj?
Yes.
"It's Khurana's stuff, How do you know?"
"Khurana sold this useless stuff,"
"I know,"
"To call Calvin Klein, he dress me up Khurana's stuff,"
"Grandma, I don't like it here"
If you and Arnav would like to live with your Daddy for a while... now that he has school holidays...?
Are you trying to send me away?
Like you sent Jai and Jagadish away?
I've no qualms about living with you.
I value your sense of integrity
"Om, I can put up with everything but I can't bear to see you sad"
"Papa, I'm ready"
"Papa, where are we going?"
To see Uncle Ramprasad
Uncle Ramprasad...
"- Ramprasad, it's me"
Stay back.
- Why don't you understand?
He knows me
The Minister for Culture has invited me to sing at his son's wedding
"Well, what brings you here?"
You know Shekhar and I...
Have split.
What next?
- I'm producing an album
And I want you to sing.
Who me...?
How Can I sing?
"You know, I'm on a 5-year contract with Shekhar."
I can't break that
But I gave you your break.
- I got a recording.
Can't talk much
"Nitu, it's only a matter of a while"
Are you bonkers?
Something like this?
"Not an E. Oh, just..."
OK.
"I think this is probably wrong here, but..."
Den...
Beds...
Time's up.
You were so close.
You found five answers.
Let's take a look on them.
"Kilmarnock, south-west of Glasgow."
"Dumfries, in southern Scotland."
"Cumbernauld, you'll know that from your tax return, I imagine."
"Airdrie, North Lanarkshire."
"Ayr - you were trying to work out what that rogue Y was, and it was Ayr, south-west of Glasgow."
So you got five answers there.
They're all places in Scotland.
They are all part of the perfect solution.
"You nearly put Aberdeen in there, that would have scuppered you."
But let's see what you could have got to get the full ten points.
Elgin.
"Now, what were you calling Elgin there?"
Igle.
Igle!
What's that Igle?
Elgin.
And Bearsden.
"Bearsden, a suburb of Glasgow."
That's what you needed to get the perfect solution.
"Nonetheless, you got five points - not half bad."
"At the end of the round, Araucarians, you're on 12,"
Lutrophiles you're leaping ahead - like the otters that you are - on 21.
We're at the final round for a place in the semifinal.
"They kill the celebrities first, and then they fuck 'em in the butt."
"Will you just relax, please?"
There are cops always in this club.
They're probably just arranging an engagement party or something.
-Just hold on a tick.
- Yeah.
[Stereo] Toe to toe
Dancing very close
"-Body breathing - [Gig] Goodevening, Officers."
- What can I do for you?
- Are you the owner?
"Yes, I am."
Gig.
"Gig, do you know a guy by the name of Jerry Green?"
He apparently is known to come in here.
"Yeah, Jerry the bookie."
Comes in here all the time.
"Has he been in here lately, because, I mean, nobody's seen this guy around for a while."
"Ah... about a week ago, I think."
Huh.
Back to back
Sacroiliac
Spine less movement
- And a wild attack
- You wanna get back to this?
- Maybe ask another question or two?
"- Yeah, yeah."
Where... do you find girls like that?
"I mean, who'd do that kind of stuff?"
"Well, you know, it's remarkably easy."
You'd be surprised.
"These two, I believe, we imported from upstate New York."
I need a sergeant by dawn.
"I'll never make a proper sergeant, sir."
So?
I'll never make a proper officer.
"Indeed you will, sir."
You'll make a grand... killing officer
Killing officer?
"God love you, sir."
I thought you would have known.
"There are two kinds of officers, sir."
Killing officers and murdering officers.
Killing officers are poor old buggers who get you killed by mistake.
"Murdering officers are mad, bad old buggers who get you killed on purpose."
"For a reason, for a country, for a religion."
Maybe even for a flag.
"You see that Major Hogan, sir?"
That's what I'd call a murdering officer
Teresa!
"Oh, that Hogan."
He's a murdering officer all right
"Damn it, Hogan!"
I wish I were down there.
So do I.
So do I. But our first duty is to protect Mrs Parker.
"That's my girl, Teresa."
Mmmm!
"Rica, huh?"
Tengo otra muy buena para ti.
Jesus!
No!
"Mr Sharpe, sir."
Lieutenant Sharpe.
He's the enemy!
"Suddenly, all homosex, we must be friendly to?"
That's not the point.
This particular homosex is one of us.
- Ain't one of me.
- We don't even have gay in India.
"Look, he's like a working stiff, juste like us guys, you know?"
"And I got to know this guy, and I kinda like him, regardless of his private... weener business."
All right?
"So we don't do that, we don't burn a guy like this, a nice guy, that's..."
That's just not the Knights of Prosperity way.
"Are you with me, Louis?"
"I'm sorry, what?"
Wait a second...
"Hold on a second, yeah!"
"Wait a minute, I got it."
"Yes, Eugene Gurkin's brain has figured it out once again!"
Ralph said his boss is cheating with his secretary.
Squatch?
Get your camera.
"So last night, I'm at the bar,I meet this girl, she's like a cross between..."
"Miss December 1993,"
"Alyssa Bridges, and Miss April 2004,"
Jamala Dissiza
"So I get her back to my place, right?"
"ok, listen, everyone."
"As of today, Frank Cortland is no longer with Burton Security."
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Carnucci?
I want you to take his place.
"- Yes, sir."
- Good.
I just picked up our little man and thought we'd drop by for a visit.
I've been trying to get Fen interested in food.
She shows a passing interest in oatmeal.
- (Fen grunting) - (Murdoch):
Any other changes?
"She's still making the gestures, but I haven't been able to decipher any pattern."
It certainly doesn't match any sign language that I can find.
(Murdoch):
Perhaps it is just random.
- (baby babbling)
"- Hello, Roland."
Am I ignoring you?
(Julia chuckling)
- Oh!
- The nanny says that
- we are to feed him more often.
- Hahaha!
"- He's hardly underfed, William."
"- I agree, but she insists."
There.
No?
"See, you're not even hungry."
(Fen grunting)
"Do you see that, William?"
(Fen grunting)
You like the baby?
- You want to see the baby?
- (Fen grunting)
"I think she's more interested in you, William."
Pa!
- She's speaking.
- Paaa!
"Your apprentice is smart, he has a bright future"
Enough is enough!
Just now it's me against you all
"Now my Master is here, let's fight if you dare"
Gao Jian
Not bad!
That's my Master's teaching!
Dad!
You want to drive me mad?
Dad!
What do you know about kung fu?
T alk about fighting?
You deserve it!
You!
"I'm sorry, I should have taught him better"
I'll teach him a good and harsh lesson
"Master Shi, please take it easy!"
"Gentlemen, please take a seat inside"
Attend to the customers!
Master!
Third day now.
Won't live long even if I survive this
Don't be such a cry-baby!
More hardship is coming
It's bad luck!
"In fact, you can take the punishment... as a form of practice"
It's not only horse stance that I'm having
What else?
A stomach stance!
You need to stand up as a man
"Y es, my eyes are standing still!"
Let me show you

It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar from Boston?
"Yes, it sure would."
Do we know each other?
"Oh, he's from Boston too, but you wouldn't know him."
- Not unless you had your house robbed.
-Maybe he would.
"We were gonna be officers together, remember?"
Only they washed me out.
Glad to see you made it.
It couldn't be that all that dough had something to do with it.
His mother's got $20 million.
"Heh, 25."
They've got a home in Nantucket with an upstairs polo field.
- Better put a canopy over his bunk.
"-Lay off, Sefton."
"With all your mother's pull, how come you're not a colonel by now?"
"Lay off, unless you want your head handed to you."
Tea is being served on the verandah.
"Animal, where are the napkins?"
"Do be seated, Bonita, heh."
What a perfectly charming table arrangement.
"They must have copied it from House Beautiful, heh."
Animal!
"How many times have I told you, you always gotta pour from the left?"
"Thank you, James, heh."
Don't encourage them.
Those are the barracks' clowns.
Where'd they get you?
Over Frankfurt?
On the Schweinfurt run.

-You remember when he tried to teach the natives how to play gin rummy?
He wound up with all the coconuts on that island.

-Where is Bilko?
Almost time for chow.
"""Chow""-- get him."
"Yeah, how do you like that?"
-How G.I. can you get?
-Are you still in?
"Hey, fellas."
"Hey, hey, hey, look."
(laughter dies down)
"Hey, he's for real!"
"Oh, you son of a gun!"
"(laughter, indistinct chatter)"
I'll bet I'd still be a private if I was in there.
Bilko in the Army-
- I'm going to sell my defense bonds.
(laughter)
"Bilko, are any of your men as dumb as we were?"
-That would be impossible.
-(laughter)
"Well, what are we standing around for?"
I've been waiting for ten years for this.
-I have nothing to tell!
-Impossible!
"At least something real, at most a dream."
Do you think it is nothing?
The dreams are part of the reality.
Is this the only reality?
-Then it will let me go?
I see.
"Then you, wherever you want."
"Well, I dreamt, that I went to a shoeshop with my boyfriend."
"Is this the story, which I interpreted?"
"Yes of course, you deserve it."
It was the most wonderful shoeshop ever seen.
There was no customer.
"Only a few women dummies, a shoeshine black... and the owner of the business."
I would like some red boots!
"Suddenly I realised, that the owner was you."
Your final fulfilment.
As you would have expected.
Run along.
"-Yes, master."
"But, Lucia!"
What are you doing?
Don't you you see?
I am with Tinto Brass.
"Aye, director!"
Ripped by elcodigo and retranslated
We need this completely filled.
We don't have time to haggle over price.
Understood.
Captain.
"You have a religion, you?"
Noo!
"Remember, it's for you."
At least you do not kill.
My woman ...
"My cross, my skin."
Want something else?
Disappear before you do a gift pack of all!

"Yes, I love you."
We have it all.
"Weaknesses, ideas, history ..."
This is what forces us to remain seated here waiting for the Cossacks!
"The weight of money, the ghosts of culture ..."
The final solution.
The Cossacks!
"If we do not, we could also go wrong, what do you think?"
"In any event, the battle sex we won."
"The final solution, Anticaglia small middle class."
"For us we just want the media, the powers of the people living, working."
"Uh, this Ellsberg, wasn't he a student ofyours at Harvard?"
"I mean, he's your idea, Henry."
So why are you running for cover?
"[Kissinger] Well, yes, we taught a class togetherat Harvard, butyou knowthese back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals."
"- No, I don't, Henry."
I don't.
- Prosecute the New York Times.
"Yeah, but it's not, bottom line, gonna change a goddamn thing, John."
The question is how do we screw Ellsberg so bad... it puts the fear of God into all leakers?
The other issue is how do we stop these leaks once and for all?
"Now, someone is talking to the press."
We gotta stop these leaks at any cost.
You hearme?
Then we can go forthe big pic...
"China, Russia."
"- [Colson] Sir, if I might?"
"- Go, Chuck."
We can do this ourselves.
The C.I.A. And the F.B.I. Aren't doing the job.
"Now, we can create our own intelligence unit right here inside the White House."
"Well, why not?"
- Our own intelligence to plug the leaks?
- [Colson] Yeah.
- Like plumbers.
- Plumbers.
I like it.
I like the idea.
"Yeah, but, uh, is it legal?"
Has itever been done before?
"Oh, sure."

The owner said he'd take care of it.
"All right, I'm going."
Did you come from home?
No.
Then what about the car?
You said you needed to take care of someone and took the car.
Yeah.
"Oh, so you didn't want to waste gas, left it at the office and took the bus here?"
"No, Moon Kwon, I came in a taxi."
What about the car?
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?
Where's the last place you went to?
Hospital.
I don't understand you.
Who leaves their car and takes a taxi?
"You shouldn't be taking care of anyone, you're the one who needs to be in the hospital."
Is something really growing in your brain?

I was just getting used to the idea of having to pay for coffee and bagels and rent.

Unacceptable.
Excuse me.
Hot girl coming through.
Oh.
Hmm.
"Three beers, please."
"Damn it, ring!"

I've been thinking about going on the Zone.

- Like the Sahara.
Here.
Give me this.
"""Intolerance to cold."" Yes. ""Arthritis, sore muscles, constipation."" Yes, yes, and yes."
""" Fatigue. "" Well, I have been kind of low-energy lately."
You have some delayed relaxation from the deep-tendon reflexes.
What about depression?

"No, I'm glass-half-full, I'm silver-lining girl."
I'm an optimist.

I need some stuff for The New York Times.
An editorial lauding our choice of convention city.
The President loves a good Times editorial.
-Let me assure you--
-The vote's in.
We got it.
Let them catch their shuttle.
I'm sure they're running late.
-Thank you.
You got that completely wrong.
The person you were after was Alan Sugar.
It was obviously Alan Sugar.
Why?
"The Mayor was going to close Sugar's sweet shop down, it was all he had, he was a desperate man."
Did you not see the VHS player in Alan Sugar's shop?
Yeah.
You did?
Yeah.
"Yes, well, did you not see that the hostage tape was misspelt, yes?"
"""Kidnapp"" takes one P."
"You were closer to that than me,"
I didn't get to look at that.
"Oh, stop talking, please!"
"Hey, don't start blaming me."
"Don't start blaming me for this, O'Leary!"
Lana Del Rey was...
That's on your conscience.
"The point is, O'Leary, it couldn't have been Miley Cyrus because she told you..."
No-one ever beat Miley Cyrus at Scrabble.
"In other words, she could spell!"
We should have just questioned her normally.
"Well, all right, in retrospect, sorry, we should have questioned her normally."
Everything in Sugar's shop was misspelt.
"Oh, I see."
"I've trodden in more intelligent things than you, O'Leary!"
Sorry.
"Yeah, you're fired!"
And it'll probably cost me my job!
I hope you're happy.
You should go for mayor.
"That's actually a good idea, sir."
"Yes, thank you."
(KNOCK ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENS)
Colonel Grant.
As-Salaam Aleikom.
(IN ARABIC) Wa alaikum assalaam.
"Sit, please."
It is a tragedy how things have turned out.
Okay.
Then let us work to resolve it.
"Indeed, yes."
"All along, I have tried merely to facilitate this poor girl's return."
As your Major Sinclair can confirm.
Yes.
"Well, I'm glad you now accept my men were not responsible for the shoot-out."
The shoot-out.
"Oh, no, no, no, no."
"Although, there is still a fatal traffic incident..."
About which we must question Mr. Scott.
"If he can recover from his wounds, of course."
I understood he survived the surgery.
"So far, yes, but complications do occur."
Hmm...
May I visit him?
"Alas, no."
He is still under arrest.
As for Mr. Stonebridge and Mr. Crawford...
"Tomorrow, we will send troops into the desert."
"I only pray we find them, before the bandits who have his daughter."
It would be deeply regrettable...
If all my men brought back...
were their two corpses.
"Rest assured, Minister."
You're embarrassed.
She's not a stranger who just walked in.
Remember that when you're talking to her.
I want to try something else.
Go out and come in again.
"Are you going to keep pestering me, Mademoiselle Principale?"
Yes.
"- Well, what is it?"
"Well, I'm not going to give in, doctor, until you..."
Excellent.
"Until I what, miss?"
"Until you, doctor, admit to the saddening fact..."
"Until I, miss, admit to the gladdening fact..."
Talk to her.
Sit.
That I firmly refuse to change the smallest detail on your lovely little nose.
I insist on saying that my nose is neither little nor lovely.
Dear Mademoiselle Francine Principale...
"You love her, don't forget that when you're talking to her."
How did I do?
Not too bad.
Want to go get some coffee?
Can't.
Do you have to stay with him all the time?
Are you assistant-director?
He's my father.
So you're assistant-father?
Hello?
"Yitzhak, it's Alex."
"Hello, Alex."
The rehearsal went well today.
"Yes, it's coming along."
"- Oh, uh..."
"Uh, I was just looking at your hair."
I'm very interested in your hair.
- Why?
- Because it's... it's interesting hair.
"I mean, it's very exquisite hair."
It's the most exquisite hair my eyes have ever beheld.
"Well, actually, I did comb it differently this morning."
"So, um, with all that said, would you be interested in going out with me?"
All right.
I guess so.
When?
"- Uh, tomorrow, after school."
- OK.
See you then.
Has a brand-new couple taken shape before my very eyes?
What can I say?
I've got the boom!
(sighs)
- What's the matter?
- Nothing's the matter.
"Yeah, you got your, uh..."
floor-length flannel armor on there.
- This happens to be very comfortable.
- Mm-hmm.
"Well, you're looking positively Amish."
"Alan... tomorrow I have three busloads of these Garden Club ladies coming to the gallery, and some of the paintings are just a little risqué."
Risqué?
What do you mean?
Like flannel-off-the-shoulder kind of...
What is with this?
Is this welded on?
I went through all your papers and completely organized your life for the next two months.
"Everything is color-coded, according to type of activity:"
"Home, Work, Ritchie or Personal, and I devised this dot system to indicate priority."
"I think you're, uh, really going to like it."
I may be wrong.
What are you doing?
"I'm sorry, but this situation with Jeff is getting more and more complicated."
I need the board.
I need to chart what our family tree would look like if Richard married New Christine and I married her father.
Okay.
Let's put it on the board.
Okay.
Write my name in the middle of the board.
Yes.
"Now write Richard next to me, and connect us with a line."
A broken line.
Thank you.
And then put Ritchie underneath us.
Yes.
And then put New Christine next to Richard.
And write...
P...
Pa...
Papa Jeff up there.
That is correct.
"Now draw a line from New Christine up and across and over to me, and..."
"Oh, my God."
I'm Ritchie's grandmother.
Where should I put me?
"Oh, who cares?"
Just go next to me.
"All right, now what we have to figure out is what would happen if we had a baby."
"It's just, well,"
"I also kind of have, like, a day job."
"- Thanks, Nikki."
- Yeah.
Or secret identity.
- Doc!
- Right.
Yeah.
"""Snow..."
Beard...
"Grace."""
"Where are the bombs, Petty?"
Again.
Why don't you just hit him with a sledgehammer?
"If you're offended, Doctor, by all means, wait outside."
Dueling sawbones.
Toe to toe.
Old school versus the avant-garde.
"If you'd like me to stop, Warden..."
"Don't be sensitive, Milton."
Tell us where they are and you'll have a wool blanket with tea piping hot in a ceramic bowl waiting for your purple pruned hands.
We'll find out one way or another.
He'll break.
Never had a man in this tub that didn't.
"He's already broken, Dr. Beauregard."
What we need to do is put him back together again.
A prescription straight from the pad of mother goose herself.
"When you're ready to come into the 20th century, please let me know."
Dr. Sengupta.
Time for the talking cure.
"Step aside, Milton."
"Yes, ma'am, it's a military medal, all right."
We will chop off your head And then laugh when you're dead
Duloc is a creepy place
Come on in What the heck
Fall right down Break your
Face
Duloc is Duloc is
Duloc is a creepy place
Get out.
- Let's do that again!
- No!
"Well, then..."
This ought to be fun.
Fun.
"Yeah, right."
I find myself agreeing with boss.
This looks to be a very entertaining evening.
You know what?
I just figured out what your costume is.
You came as a kiss-up!
"All right, all right."
"Buckle up, everybody."
"The quicker I scare the wits out of you lot, the sooner I can be home, cozy in my bed."
Unless anyone else thinks they've got what it takes?
"Pick me, pick me!"
I have a scary story.
"This isn't the one about you getting trapped in the petting zoo again, is it?"
'Cause that's not scary.
"Actually, if you look at it from my perspective..."
"Hey, guess what, Pinocchio?"
No one cares!
"Get ready to send these jokers home, Shrek, 'cause I've got a doozy."
And it's all true.
Leave me!
- Panju...
When is Manoj's birthday?
- September 12th.
He keeps annoying!
Don't move!
Won't you leave?
Sir...
Stay quiet!
Sadhana!
What are you doing here?
How did you come here?
Are you still after her?
I wonder why I came running for you!
"Your mom is worried about you, wondering where you are, what you are doing..."
"And here you are, roaming behind your lover."
Don't talk nonsense without knowing about the situation!
This is Ashwini.
Are you trying to act wise by changing her name?
I know that it's Deepa.
I can never forget that face.
You were all intimate with her at the restaurant!
If you knew Deepa all along...
Why didn't you mention it when I was searching for her?
"Yes, it's my mistake."
Big mistake!
"I should have found he, gotten her married to you, and blessed you both."
It's my mistake.
Please forgive me.
You will never change.
You will go completely mad roaming behind her!
Please don't blabber without knowing the situation.
I don't know anyone who fits that description.Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
Is that a threat?
"No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Father, wait a minute!"
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
That's too bad.
I hate to go alone.
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I've got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
Who's in it?
Debbie Reynolds:
Desdemona and Othello:
Groucho Marx.
Are you happy?
I've seen it.
One last time.
Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Come on!
"No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
You know who I think really did it?
Who?
The Dominicans.
"Well, what can you have him do?"
Other than go around making people's belts unbuckle.
The possibilities are unlimited.
"Oh, come on."
"It's just some gimmick, that's all."
Tony...
"Mr. Sickle, whose life you saved,"
Doesn't seem to believe in you.
"Mr. Sickle needs convincing, Tony."
[knob squeaks] [gas hissing]
"Hey, come on."
"Hey, get back!"
Get back!
Get back!
Don't.
[grunting] get back!
[goat bleats]
I can see how that'd be a big hit at a scientific convention.
"But the bottom line is, how do we make money with it?"
[goat bleats]
I will demonstrate an industrial application.
"Come with me, Tony."
[gas continues to hiss]
"Now, Tony, those wine casks..."
Stack them...
Neatly.
"Two glasses of burgundy, please."
To molecular mobilization.
To molecular capitalization.
- [goat bleats] - [gas hisses]
"[muscles] hey, got any more clues?"
No.
How did you know?
- How long have you been following me?
- A while.
"- Look, I haven't got much time to explain."
It's not safe for me.
- What?
- Or you.
- What are you talking about?
"I was meant to give it to someone else and he knows you have it, Harry."
- Are you talking about the bracelet?
- I know you're a good man which is why I gave it to you instead of him but he'll come after you!
- Who'll come after me?
- The man it was promised to.
What is this?
Whoever wears the bracelet is endowed with immense luck.
"- Well, that's shite."
"- You're already starting to feel it though, aren't you?"
"No, wait, wait, wait."
Don't go.
"It's a balance, Harry."
It's yin and yang.
Luck like this has its own unique price.
- Gold.
- Steel.
- Gold.
"Whilst at Cambridge, Sebastian Faulks appeared on what TV quiz?"
- University Challenge.
- Pass.
University Challenge.
Life On The Mississippi is a memoir by which American author?
Mark Twain.
You're totally not going to do this.
"They did E at the club, then some coke back at her place."
My daughter loves her in those two dance school movies.
Those were Disney movies.
She was just a kid.
And how old is she now?
Old.
Twenty.
Exactly.
Is there a point you're making that I'm missing?
"Look, 99% of 12-year-old girls would kill to be the illegal-drinking,"
"E-popping, club-crawling Chelsea Sennett."
Ain't America grand?
Not if you have a 12-year-old daughter.
How late was Colin here?
About 5:00.
We were just having fun.
He never even mentioned his girlfriend.
What about this boy?
You ever seen him?
The victim helped us with this sketch of her assailant.
I don't know.
He looks like he could be 100 different people.
"Miss Sennett, can I have a word?"
You ever go to Throb?
Or Cushion?
Sure.
What about way back when Cushion was called Class A?
"No, but I hear it kicked."
Mmm.
Legend's always better than the truth.
My partner and I are after a group of burglars working the club circuit.
They target people like you and Colin 'cause you're young and famous and it's easy to track when you stay out late.
I think you had a druids dream.
I think you instinctively knew
You were going to meet da veiga.
"Sydney, nigel."
"(nigel:)doesn't look much like a map, does it?"
I don't understand.
How's that supposed to
Lead us to the astronomicons?
There are words written down
One side of the blade.
"It's latin, I think"
They may reference the map.
"First I nearly get us killed,"
Now I've stolen the wrong package.
"Yeah, well you should have"
Come to us honestly.
(andreas:)I could have proved to you
That I'm an academic in my own right.
Dedicated to the conservation of relics.
But I knew you'd never trust
Anyone named da veiga.
I don't expect you to understand.
Try me.
(andreas:)after my father got back
"From the jungle, he was badly burned..."
Doctors said he'd die.
He didn't.
He asked to see me.
I wouldn't at first.
He hadn't done more than
Send me a card at christmas
And birthdays since my mother died
It was just a little Nurofen Plus...
LAUGHTER ..sort of size.
Then that worked its way down my trouser leg.
AUDIENCE GROANS
Did you shake it out?
I did.
I kicked it towards Christopher Biggins.
LAUGHTER
Hoped for the best.
Awful.
"But she didn't notice, did she?"
"Well, she gave me that look."
LAUGHTER
"""You shat yourself."" She didn't say anything to me."
Did she shake hands and then push you away?
She's notorious for doing that.
"No, she chatted to everyone, and she got to me and I just got the look and she moved on."
"I think someone had warned her, ""Don't speak to him."""
"Yeah. ""He's a shitter, Ma'am."""
LAUGHTER
"""Move on, Ma'am, he's shat himself."""
LAUGHTER
"all right, fuck this!"
Fuck this!
LAUGHTER
"Whenever I see you, Jack Dee,"
"I remember you being in the Edinburgh Festival and you telling me a story with, like, a really naughty chuckle in your voice, because you'd seen Paul Morocco..."
Do you remember this?
"Yes, I know."
"..Paul Morocco, the famous and quite brilliant juggler..."
Yes.
"..in a bank in Edinburgh, during the festival, trying to cash a cheque and he didn't have any ID, and he was saying, ""But I'm Paul Morocco."
"It'sokay,yourbaby'sfine ."
Not...
Thebaby.
Okay.
HekilledSean.
"Honey,thepoliceknow."
Theydon't...
They didn't see it.
It wasn't human.
Okay.
All right.
All right.
Please... no...
"I'msosorry,Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Yourimmunitymakes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
Lydia!
Jackson will be there seeking his next target.
"Excuse me, but who are you?"
"- ""Introductions by Elise."""
Introduction...?
Intro...
Oh.
"- Oh, you're a dating service."
- Executive matchmaker.
Oh.
And a very large contributor.
I'm gonna cut right to the chase:
"You are the 200-pound tuna of bachelors, senator."
"You really don't have time to separate the wheat from the chaff,"
Grace Kellys from the Britney Spears.
That's where I come in.
- We need to meet the governor.
- Very nice meeting you.
- Lovely to meet you.
Think about it.
- You bet.
- Give me that.
- You didn't find her persuasive?
No.
"Objectifying, pushy, judgmental?"
"Yes, definitely."
She is trying to bring people together.
That is noble work.
- She looked at you like meat.
"- Tuna, actually."
If the press ever got wind of you using a madam...
- Matchmaker.
- They're gonna have a field day.
Can you think of a less romantic way to meet someone?
Rose!
"- Hi, Alex."
- I can't believe it's you.
My God!
"Alex, get a fucking grip."
- You look incredible!
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she look incredible?
"- Yes, we already covered that."
"- Oh, yes!"
- Can I have another drink.
- I thought you hated salad.
- I do.
"I just can't eat a big cheeseburger in the middle of the day anymore, ya know?"
- Doesn't it bloat you?
- Bloat me?
- Yeah.
"- No, it doesn't bloat me."
"Actually, I thought it went really well with the spareribs I had for breakfast this morning."
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.
"I just thought we'd always be in the same boat, ya know what I'm sayin'?"
It made it easier somehow.
I know.
Tell you what.
I'll give you half my salad if you give me half your burger.
- We'll need some more dressing.
- Definitely.
Waiter!
"We all WANT to be attractive, but remember:"
One of the first things people notice... the one thing that makes a lasting impression... is... your smile.
"If you're like most people, your appearance is important to you."
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- Him hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
- If you're concerned with the truth...
why did you lie about me?
- Your name didn't even come up.
- Not the gun thing.
With Sharon!
What you said to her about me and Jordan Catalano.
- What are you talking about?
"- l heard her, Brian."
You told her terrible things.
Yeah.
Previously on Gilmore Girls:
- What do you mean you had an accident?
- Jess swerved and...
Jess was driving and you had an accident?
But I'm fine.
What accident?
Jess was driving Rory's car and he crashed it.
- Have you talked to Dean?
"- No, he gets home tomorrow."
- What'll you say?
- I don't know.
"If you hadn't brought him here, this wouldn't have happened."
This is my fault?
- What did you do to your arm?
- Here.
- What is this?
- Just read it.
"Now I have to find Jess, and I have to make sure that he's okay... and if that cuts into your screaming time, that's just too damn bad."
- Go to hell!
- Right back at you!
Not long after the accident happened...
"Luke walked him straight to the bus station... stuck the kid on the bus, sent him home to his mom."
- Is he really gone?
- Yes.
Okay.
Do you wanna come in?
All I know is that Jess is gone.
"Well, what will we do for entertainment around here?"
Beats the hell out of me.
- Where is this place?
- 'Singing.'
- Who told you?
"Here, here, none of that."
Give the little girl a chance.
"Remember, Rome was not built in a day."
"Please, please."
Not too close to the artist.
"My dear Miss Chummy, straighten out your tonsils and try to..."
"Mr. Chowsky, I can't sing if the atmosphere isn't cogelial."
- The atmosphere isn't what?
- Cogelial.
Not only sings a broken melody but speaks a broken English.
- Music.
- Winter.
"* Winter has passed, oh winter no more *"
"* So way up in the sky you can soar, can soar * [yodeling]"
* All is such a..
* And you are free
* To build your nest.
Wait a minute.
What's that business with the tangled digits?
"I'm building a nest, you see it's all symbolical."
I see.
- Music.
- Flying.
* Flying and floating rest on your wing *
* Just joy and happiness around you bring * [piano music]
- Do you have to dance also?
- I gotta show my versatility.
"That's versatility, huh?"
"Yes, you can never tell what I'll develop into."
You should only develop into double pneumonia.
Above the stairs...
I'll write you where I am in case something happens.
- What would happen?
"- I said ""in case""!"
And don't overstrain yourself now!
Drive careful and look after yourself.
Yes.
"And you look after our child, dear!"
Brennemann?
"Brennemann, wait a minute... he was such a nice young man from the East Zone..."
Görlitz!
"Yes, but where he ended up... that I don't know."
- Didn't he say something about Düsseldorf?
- Düsseldorf?
"Ah, now I recall."
"There were some old family heirlooms, destroyed in the bombings, that were deposited with us."
Now he has sold everything.
"Away with it, he said"
Brennemann!
"And I'll have you know that 23,50 Marks too much was incorrectly charged in storage fees."
"- Well, what do you say to that?"
That's my husband all over!
"What didn't belong to him, he did not want."
"It was here 4 months, but debt never lapses, he always said."
Because there's always a chance he'll return.
"Well, forget about it!"
What now?
I see!
Bruno!
"- Yes, what is it?"
- Come here!
"Oh, dear Lord!"
"Yesterday, I was unemployed."
"Today, I guess I'm retired."
"That makes two of us, brother."
"But in a stunning development this morning, the lottery commissioner suspended all payment to Captain Stottlemeyer after it was revealed that Stottlemeyer has known and worked with Natalie Teeger, the newly hired lotto ball girl."
There is a news conference...
He said we cheated.
Why?
Just because you know the Captain?
I...
I mean...
Okay.
"It looks bad, but it's not impossible."
No.
It's not just that.
They said they have proof.
They checked the equipment.
There was something wrong with the machine.
It was rigged.
Rigged?
They said I'm going to jail.
"Mr. Monk, I'm sorry I said I quit."
I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
You have to help me.
Yeah.
"Good morning, Miss Teeger, Captain."
"You and your friend, Mr. Monk, wanted to see what evidence we had?"
Yeah.
"Well, here it is."
"Before we begin, is there anything you want to say to the lottery commissioner?"
Yep.
"well, now, what is that?"
That's the treasure chest of a pirate?
"-Oh, stanley."
would you--?
"-That's pearls, stella."
Ropes of them.
"What is this sister of yours, a deep-sea diver?"
"bracelets, solid gold."
Where are your pearls and gold bracelets?
"Be still, stanley."
And here.
Diamonds.
A crown for an empress.
A rhinestone tiara she wore to a costume ball.
-What is rhinestone?
-Next door to glass.
Yeah.
I have an acquaintance who works in a jewelry store and he's coming to make an appraisal of that stuff.
"-Here's your plantation fella, right here."
-You know I-
- Stupid and horrid.
You stay away from these things before she comes out of the bathroom.
The KowaIskis and the DuBois got a different notion on this.
"Indeed they have, thank heavens."
I'm going outside.
Go ahead.
You come on out with me while blanche is getting dressed.
"Now, since when are you giving me orders?"
Are you gonna stay here and insult her?
You bet your life I'm gonna stay here.
"hello, stanley."
"Here I am, all freshly bathed and scented and feeling like a brand-new human being."
Like his wife!
You have to choose a page.
With those ice cream?
There are better machines!
"Without us, they have no future."
They were built for and by us!
"They are not our children, they are slaves."
Our survival depends on extermination!
"Open your eyes, Bishop!"
"We are surrounded by ice, this planet is dead!"
There are not enough resources to pick them up these days.
Would you choose those of your own kind?
If this is what we will become  then yes!
I choose them.
Your new rank is JMATR!
FUCK MORE THAN ALL RECOGNITION!
After your Spartan body.
"Alpha, Mike, Foxtrot!"
Also know as...
"Goodbye, motherfuckers."
Kill him!
What the...?
Something is wrong with the weapons Malfunction!
"Malfunction of the weapon, sir!"
"Welcome to the area of death, idiots!"
Come on!
Kill these weak heads!
What happens to you?
Come on!
This is not over yet!
You come to my death list!
I will hunt you personally!
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety ofthe passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died ofa heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
His name is Tony Weng.
He works with a drug ring in Central America.
He was acquitted.
Until now.
I'm in the acquittal business.
"Look, it's my life's mission to keep the wrongly accused"
From being incarcerated.
"Yeah, like, uh, like that little girl last year, right?"
Was accused of killing her brother.
Yes!
Thank you for bringing that up.
One of my great trials.
Hannah miller.
"Evidence against hannah was, uh, was overwhelming."
Yes.
Until they found a pair
Of girl's glasses at the crime scene that didn't match.
"Now, obviously, that was left by the real killer."
And the jury agreed with me.
Yes.
How convenient.
"Ah, well, you know,"
I'm good at finding holes in the prosecution's case.
"I mean, that is my gift."
Your gift is planting evidence.
"Oh, wh-wh-wh-whoo."
Careful.
That's libelous.
About the enright case.
Fact remains that
"Those cuff links left a reasonable doubt,"
And you were the one that purchased 'em.
We have proof right there.
"Oh, I see."
He's required to call on the widow.
Is anything wrong?
Don't talk to anyone without checking with me first.
Okay?
We're in the wrong business.
You get lost?
"There's a key to downtown Brooklyn, but I sure don't have it."
"Murray, Lenny, you know Kevin."
"Kevin, this is Dan."
"Kevin, how are you?"
"Tex, sit down."
Take a load off.
"Louisiana, Murray, for the umpteenth time."
Can't take a joke?
Jimmy!
What'll you have?
"Oatmeal with skim milk, bananas, brown sugar."
So what's new?
I'll give you the headlines.
Standard  Poor's going to lower the city's credit rating.
We're going to close two firehouses.
Results: 150 demonstrators at City Hall.
The park commissioner has quit to run the San Francisco Ballet.
The stock exchange insists on leaving town.
Plus a zillion other little rancid goodies.
Plus a kid got shot.
- And a drug dealer.
- And a cop.
No wonder the deputy mayor's here in Brooklyn.
"Well, but he's very welcome."
"The stock exchange, where are they removing to, my boy?"
"White Plains, they mutter."
"Pardon, my dear, I feel the need of a cigar."
[jazz music]
- The check.
"- Uh, yes, ma'am."
I'll take care of it.
[music continues]
- You may keep the change.
- Thank you.
"We must go now, my dear, pressing business engagement at the theater."
"Waiter, check if you please."
"Never mind, I paid."
"My dear duchess, why are you always paying the check?"
It's deuce and embarrassing.
Anybody think we were married.
"Oh, Commodore, what are you saying?"
"Oh, come, come, we must be dashing."
[engines revving]
Taxi.
[car honking]
"Drop you at the theater, Commodore?"
"No, my dear, just a bracer from here."
I shall call for you opening night and escort you to what no doubt will prove to be one of my greatest successes.
"Until then, au revoir, my dear."
"- Set right, cabbie."
"- Bye, goodbye, Commodore."
"- Ah, Chowsky."
"- Please, Mr. Commodore."
"Ah, what's the trouble, what's up?"
I'm going to drown myself in a sea of vodka.
"Pleasant death, any particular reason?"
Particular reason?
It is the end of Chowsky.
A smart looking guy is a big shot!
So what?
"Oh, good, you're here."
"I know things have been a little slow lately, but I have made a decision that is going to change our business in a profound way."
You're getting out of clocks and into something that makes sense.
SALEM:
I got it.
Designer cat food.
"No, and fat chance, Tubby."
I have something in the store room that is going to have a line of customers snaking around the block.
Ta-da!
"Well, I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say ""creepy."""
"Well, there'll certainly be a nice deduction come tax time."
"All right, I'll give you one more chance."
"Salem, what do you think?"
Let me be delicate.
Those clocks are awful.
Is that so?
I-I mean awful good.
Look over there.
"No, over there!"
"No, over there!"
(whimpering):
"Oh, change me back or take me to Wimbledon."

"I mean, the Ark's in the hands of a fanatic who thinks that it's a cigar box."
And the key that opens it is a thousand miles away at the Royal Academy in London.
"MacGyver, i-is there a purpose behind these acrobatics?"
"Oh, I hope so."
Watch your eyes.
Bravo.
I always said you were my brightest student.
If only you had applied yourself at university.
Professor!
Quite right.
Carry on.
Looks like that gate's the only way out of here.
Come on.
Put this on.
What?
I'm not leaving without the Ark.
Professor--
"MacGyver, the Torch of Truth is in that Ark."
I'm not leaving without it.
All right.
Understood.
"The final shipment of arms is being unloaded now, Colonel Petrovic."
Good.
A schedule has been brought forward.
We attack in two hours.
"If the prisoners are spies, the U.N. forces may know of our plans."
We should strike at once.
Could these men be telling the truth?
That old chest-- It does not matter.
They are to be executed immediately.
Those barbarians must have tried to force it open.
Look.
We may be the only English ship in the Mediterranean.
- Do you insist on the rendezvous?
- I insist on carrying out my orders which are to escort a convoy.
- A French ship will be waiting.
- I can see it now.
- You've been proved right once before.
"Here, I feel you are wrong."
There will be no French ship.
Only the fear of one.
- Sir!
- Listen.
They're celebrating already.
- Sir.
- And why not?
There will be plenty of prize money for all hands with these two beauties.
- Pay attention.
- I've detailed the crews to sail them.
The third lieutenant in charge of the frigate.
"Good luck, Mr. D'Arblay."
- A pleasant voyage to Rochefort.
- Thank you.
- You must listen.
- Kellahorn's leading the merchantman.
I've given him a junior midshipman to assist him.
Mr. Crawford.
Mr. Crawford?
- Take care of that ship.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Get her back safely.
Pull away.
Hoist away.
I thought you wanted the boy onboard with you.
Thus qeu do?
Bujar was right.
You lost all respect!
I'll be back tonight.
And you will tell me everything.
Get it?
"Daddy, do not go!"
Behave!
Go back!
"Dad, come back!"
Good thing we have a coordination center.
I am proud to say that this research will be led by our delegated Helen Sikkeland.
The OS of Oslo appointed for this case here in Mysen.
"Given his experience in Kripos, this research is in excellent hands."
-I Could not identify the connection.
-Imaginei He could not.
"It's obvious, but what makes me angry is that I did not know that there is only one person in it."
'Tell me what you have.
-Ok.
They were members of Ferrymen and supported the Sixers.
Sixers sell marijuana and amphetamines.
They do not play.
-So They were responsible?
-may Be.
The Ferrymen lost two deliveries because of the informant.
It's a great debt.
-Possível.
-Possível.
Even if the victim has been saved on their own.
"-If So, the Audi could have been her."
-Encontraram The GPS in the car?
-Do Not.
Your Father Name:
Sivaratnam.
Your Grandfather Name:
Navaratnam.
- It seems Ratnam is the common capital for all.
Exactly..
This Maniratnam is a bonded slave to the family of Vasundhara Devi.
He is now here to find out a secret.
This is peaks to the peaks and is sensational.
Oh my god..
I remember by secret PK bro.
If required I will catch your feet.
You catch the hands of my wife.
Say whether there is someone else in her heart.
I helped so many people.
You are my friend.
Come!
What is this meaningless thing?
"Even if my sister agrees for this test, I will not agree."
My sister is like fire!
Who are you to agree?
Catch his hand.
Why do you just leave without saying anything?
I cannot break families by telling.
Ethics are wealth for me.
"No problem, tell."
My heart is like the granite.
Then listen this..
Another one is seen in your wife's life.
He is a very tall guy and dangerous man.
He stepped in a company as an employee and has married the daughter of the Chairman.
"Correct, right?"
Last I heard.
True story.
"- Oh, this was so cold."
- Yeah.
- It was raining too.
- Look at those boys.
How can you just not love them and wanna hang out?
Jonny's beatboxing was really funny.
"This was when the ""let me show you my balls"" thing happened."
"- Yeah, that was that night."
- Right there.
A guy wanted to show us his balls.
Didn't get to.
So a guy on our movie or some other dude?
- A drunk guy that was stumbling...
- A guy tried to show us his balls.
- Christo handled it perfectly.
- Christo and Self handled it.
- What did Christo do?
- Christo handled his balls.
"Christo is our first AD, who is..."
- Handsome.
- Handsome.
- Hand me some of that.
- And so sweet.
Gorgeous.
Ari.
"By the way, this pregnant lady actually threw up like in the left over where the chairs were, before we started shooting."
Threw up everywhere in between her legs and then just proceeded to sit there for 20 minutes with her and her boyfriend and nobody cleaned it up.
I feel like that was a good omen.
- This is the greatest...
- Ari.
Compared to you and Charlotte anything's quick.
"- Softly softly, catchee monkee."
- I didn't know you spoke Spanish.
See!
I told you this was a great place to get your fingers stinky.
"Oh, my god, she's going for his cock."
"Oh, what you doing?"
Shall we go somewhere more private?
- I want you.
- Right.
"Careful, no-one's touched that before, it might go off."
Good!
"Crikey, careful."
Are they allowed to do that in here?
- Crikey!
"- Fuck me, she's gonna wank him off!"
The jammy git's pulled an experienced cock handler.
"Or, someone so inexperienced she thinks it's the best way to pull an older boy."
- Either way it's a win-win situation.
"- It's not really, though, no?"
"Thanks to me, we're now watching Simon get wanked off."
Thank you so much!
- Getting a bit weird now.
- I hate it when he makes eye contact.
"None of us do, Neil."
Call me a short arse now!
"Come on then, you fucking coward!"
"- Oh, please, not his face!"
- I'm gonna do you!
"Northwood are in the house, you're fucking dead!"
How embarrassing.
- That was brilliant!
Need your vote now.
"Oh, my God, that was so fun."
"Thought you said no one says ""blog"" anymore, huh?"
"Bye, Fred."
"Goodbye, Mrs. Finnerty."
Oil painting by Tom Freeman to commemorate the burning of the White House by the British in 1814.
"- Wait, the White House burned down?"
"- Yeah, yeah, in the War of 1812."
Practically had to be rebuilt from the ground up.
"When I look at this painting, I get very emotional."
John.
I think I need to avail myself of one of the 35 bathrooms in here.
There's a ladies' room downstairs.
- Where?
I'll take her.
"- I can go by myself, John."
I'm not a child.
"Hey, just don't touch anything or wander off or talk to anybody that you shouldn't be talking to."
I make no promises.
He's seven minutes behind.
"Sorry, he got hung up on the State Floor."
"- Good morning, Margaret."
"- Morning, Mr. President."
Could you get the speaker on the phone?
"Right away, sir."
Have you and the missus zeroed in on a dining establishment?
When have you known the missus to zero in on anything?
"Fair point, sir."
"Martin, I wanna shake your hand."
- We're all sorry to see you go.
"- Thank you, Mr. President."
"And I know that you and Muriel have had a tough go of it since Kevin passed, and..."
Casshern.
Devour Casshern!
Kill him...
Kill Casshern!
Devour Casshern!
Why?
What do you stand to gain by devouring me?
The Ruin cannot be stopped now.
"Kill me if you must, Casshern, but this body won't last more than half a year amidst this destruction."
What does that have to do with me?
"Casshern, he who devours you shall attain eternal life."
That's ludicrous.
"I don't know if it's true or not, but to die without even trying is too wretched to fathom!"
Die!
The Ruin cannot be stopped...
He who devours me shall attain eternal life...
Kill Casshern.
Devour Casshern.
Kill Casshern!
Devour Casshern!
Kill Casshern.
So you become fragile when you lose consciousness...
It certainly is a fragile world.
A world of nothing but robots.
Ohji...
"Ringo, you're awake?"
You know you need to sleep.
I know.
Devour Casshern...
What an absurd concept.
You'll gain nothing by devouring him.
It won't stop the Ruin.
One not inclined to exaggeration.
What can this be?
Is Col. Brandon here?
- My horse!
- What's the matter?
- I must away to London.
- Impossible!
We can't picnic without our host.
Come up to town tomorrow.
- Or wait until we return.
- I can't afford to lose one minute.
- Forgive me.
- I hope it's nothing serious.
"Upon my soul, this is all very unusual."
"- Frailty, thy name is Brandon."
- Some cannot bear pleasure.
You are a wicked pair.
Col. Brandon will be missed.
Why?
"Everyone speaks well of him, but no one remembers to talk to him."
Nonsense.
He is highly respected at Barton Park.
- Which is enough censure in itself.
"- Really, Willoughby."
"Come, come, Mr. Impudence."
I know your wicked ways.
Reveal your beau.
No secrets between friends.
I'll winkle it out of you.
"I'll have you married to the colonel by tea, or I'll swallow my bonnet."
- As if you could marry him.
- Why should you dislike him?
Thank you ...wonderful to be here.
Excuse me...
"Wow, you could have made an effort, Georgie."
Kill me now.
Hey!
"Oh, hey!"
Funny little dress.
"Such a little bitch, though."
"Ok, who wants to get high?"
"That's not very much for 3, is it?"
"Uh, we're gonna do blowbacks."
Blowbacks?
"What, what?"
Blowbacks.
What is that?
Who's got a light?
I've got a light.
"Thank you, thank you!"
Thank you for coming.
Everyone...
Thank you for supporting the Foundation.
"As you all know well, this auction is part of the Clios heritage."
And we are so glad to see the same familiar faces every year.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you and of course, we thank Georgina for the pleasure of this beautiful location, which is very dear to my heart."
Let's celebrate our beloved Constantine by having a good time tonight.
"Adele LeTissiet, leading light of the international opera scene."

Addons I was preparing for a low turbulence.
Addons In the case of pressure loss I and oxygen on the tiles.
How long before New York?
6 hours.
Even if you fly full speed.
"Addons now make a brief pause, Before the game started."
That is some of you in New York?
I do not.
This is the first time you fly.
Really?
You're doing very well.
What are you doing?
It should to sit in our seats.

I hate couples.
You asked how we met.
"Granted, you kind of had to be there."
"Oh, no."
"No, not you guys."
You're great.
Just couples in general.
"The Jamaican resort I went to last Christmas, it was couples only."
And you were flying solo?
Changed my perspective.
Couples everywhere.
It was crazy.
Look at this airport-- it's got every variety.
Like those guys--
Self-Important Pete and his Electric Lady.
"Course, they haven't spoken directly to each other since the brownout of '06."
Then there's those two--
Daddy Issues Debbie and her college professor Marty Midlife-- teaching her all he knows about advanced economics
- and the Kama Sutra.
- Wait.
"Tony, that's no couple."
They're clearly father and daughter.
Think so?
Yeah.
Turn around.
MacPherson is alive and he's loose somewhere in the world.
- Stopping MacPherson is not your job!
- My what?
Protecting the world happens to be my job!
And right now that is being threatened by an insane ex-Warehouse agent who is competing for artifacts that belong right out there.
Mrs. Frederic said that she will handle it.
I can do it.
He ran a sword through your chest.
- I'm all right.
- You could have died.
"Please just let Mrs. Frederic handle it, okay?"
This?
"This is your job, Artie."
And you're not doing it.
"You have Pete, Myka, and Claudia spread out through the Warehouse taking inventory for you day after day."
"- Meanwhile, all..."
"- Meanwhile, these things are piling up."
"Yes, they are."
I'm pretty hard to kill.
Really?
Really?
You want some of this?
Nice one.
Did not see that coming.
- Playing with yourself again?
- One game.
A quickie.
We got time.
"Besides, none of this stuff's going anywhere."
"Right, buddy?"
"Okay, this stuff is dangerous, all right?"
And then it keeps on splitting wider and wider
When it hits each successive bird 'cause it makes it easier for the birds to fly that way.
- Good.
So--so what... does the sword...do?
The blade in this particular sword
Is said to be so perfect that light splits in its path
And goes around the person holding it.
"Um, are we--are we talking about, um, invisibility?"
Mm.
Kind of.
In effect.
"No, the person's still there."
"Although, you know, the light that we see"
"Doesn't hit-- yes, invisibility."
Awesome.
I knew-
- I knew that was possible.
I knew it.
Okay.
Invisible swords now...
"Hey, Artie, these are-- these are the same sword, right?"
- Yeah.
- They don't match.
What?
"Well, you see, disc thing that's attached to the grip--"
"Well, it's in the painting, but it's not in the sword"
From the dig site.
It's missing its tsuba.
"This piece right here is called a ""tsuba."""
"It's actually a collectible in its own right,"
"You know, separate from the sword."
But this is missing its tsuba.

1984.
Armed robbery.
"1987, 1992."
You get the idea.
And here he is today.
Better known today as Jimmy In-'n-Out.
"City, State, and Federal."
He's spent 44 of the last 58 years inside.
An entire life behind bars.
Jimmy provides a very special service.
"For a price, Jimmy will go to prison for you."
On purpose?
The guy goes to prison on purpose?
He's actually more comfortable inside.
The outside world hasn't been too kind to him.
"Sometime during the Clinton administration,"
Jimmy figured out how he could use his talents to turn a profit.
So...
- When does all this happen?
- It's already happening.
The buy is set for tomorrow.
"Cops bust Jimmy, Badger gets out, everybody's happy, and all it's gonna cost you is 80,000 and one pound of your finest meth."
"$80,000 for eight years of his life, huh?"
"First of all, he's not gonna do eight years."
"I'm gonna represent him, and I guarantee there's gonna be some unexpected problems with the prosecution's case."
"Secondly, he gets 30."
50 goes to me.
- You get 50?
For what?
- For facilitating.
Who's taking a bigger risk?
Mood:
"- Hassled, hot, hostile, relaxed."
- You're histerical.
I'm used to hanging out with these people too long.
- It catches on.
- Totally.
I like to stay away from the fashion car when I'm not working.
"But it's so incestuous, everybody is doing everybody else."
They feel like they don't get to miss out or something like that.
- It's pathetic.
"- Listen, I gotta get back to work... before I get fired, but maybe we could grab a drink after?"
"I'd love to, but unfortunately my day doesn't end here."
- Maybe tomorrow.
- Great.
"There's this cool band named Nimbus, playing at the Rebard's... it's like some disco, some funk, interested?"

- Dunno.
I'm not sure the lyrics make much difference.
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."

"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
That or La Bamba.
"Remember what you need to dance La Bamba, Calum?"
Feet.
- Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"- Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip to the shop for the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is on thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life
- and that is you will never see me dance.
- I'll put money on it.
One day you'll dance.
- Who's that out there?
- Jude Cassidy.
Don't think that I care for you.
I just need you alive.
"What do you mean, he's gone?"
- Argument about the M25.
- You had an argument about the M25?
"John, you can't leave me here on my own, please."
"- Who else can I go to, Rose?"
- We're negotiating.
And how do you know that?
And are you really opening with a Shakespeare quote?

"Consider this number blocked, too."
"This is my cousin, Eli."

"This is Audrey, Noah."
"Hey, man."
"First day, huh?"

"- Sure, except, in this school, people get killed by knife-wielding maniacs every 20 years, give or take."
"Excuse me! ""Girl's only"" moment."
"(SIGHS) So, out of nowhere, Branson hits me up this morning."
Yeah.
"He said he just ""heard"" Jake and I broke up."
Whoa!
How did he hear that?
Barely anyone even knew that you were together.
What is it with men from the past mysteriously showing up?
"Wait, what does that mean?"
"Emma's deadbeat dad resurfaced, too."
"Okay, not cool."
And that is a totally different thing.
And I was also not ready to share that!
You weren't gonna share it with me?
"The person I told this morning wasn't exactly supportive, so..."
"- Yeah, uh-huh."
- You seem a little...
- Distracted.
"- I'm sorry, Amaar,"
I'm just trying to schedule an important meeting with Charles.
- Oh!
"Well, I can come back..."
"- No, no, you're here"
Interrupting me now.

I was wondering if...
- You know the thing is...
"Charles and I are both so busy, we just can't line up our schedules."
I can't even get in touch with him.
"I've emailed, texted, phoned!"
The only thing left is Facebook or kidnapping.
"Oh, Facebook!"
"Hello, Facebook Charles,"
I'm poking you.
"Yeah, you like that, don't you?"
"Poke, poke, poke."
"You know, you can only poke someone once until they poke back."
"OK, really quick question:"
what do I do to build a mosque in Mercy?
"You know, what you really need is to start off with a press conference."
"Invite the media, invite the town."
You know what?
"There's a town meeting later on tonight, you can piggyback it."
I'll even waive the permit fees.
- What permit fees?
- Bribes.
Ok?
"And I need that in a cashier's check or a money order, doesn't matter."
"Actually, I want it in a money order."
And make it out to Ice Station Zebra Associates.
That's my loan-out.
It's totally legit.
It's done just for tax purposes.
"After that, we can discuss Visa or MasterCard, but definitely not American Express, so don't even ask."
All right?
Any questions?
"You're gonna get me off, right?"

"Five fingers, no waiting?"
"That's a joke, Brandon."
Lighten up.
"Son, I promise you this."
I will give you the best criminal defense that money can buy.
"Francesca, I took these already."
Didn't I take these already?
Ok.
"Look, it's on your head."
You're not supposed to double up on Vitamin A. It's bad for the liver.
"Okay, who's next?"
Did him.
I did him.
That one went public defender.
Thanks for nothing.
"What happened to my masturbator, Francesca?"
You got me all turned around.
Hang on.
I'll get back to you.
"Gentlemen, I sense you're discussing my client."

"Proud of you, though."
"Why do all your stories involve a punch in the face, a shifty European, or a broad who's been around the block?"
That reminds me of when I had to rough up this Italian kid because he didn't want me dating his sister.
She was no nun!

"Oh, Cleveland!"
"So, you decided to go on the cruise without me, huh?"
"Well, to make it up to me..."
"Roberta, cover your ears."
"I want two oral sins when I want them, even after a flight, and no reciprocals."
"Get us out of this, and you can have one with no reciprocals and three egg cracks."
Mm.
Can I have an egg crack now?
Crack.
Ooh...
"Oo-hoooo, there's egg all down my shoulders."

So gooey.
"Okay, stay here, I'll be back."

Bye.
"Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it."
"*MICHAEL EVERY DAY* Season 02 Episode 06 ""Hodophobia Part 2"" Synchronized by srjanapala"
you're an alcoholic.
Yesterday was an unusual day.
You drank at lunch.
I had one beer.
"Three, actually."
And then you drank the champagne before you tried to poison a moose.
That was to make room for the pills.
You drank at the trucker bar.
"I mean, you really drank there."
And let's say
- it was stress-induced drinking...
"- I can relate to that, but..."
It was something you said to the stripper
- that really sealed it.
- At the bar?
"- At the hotel, at 4:28."
- What did I say?
"You said ""I'm an alcoholic."""
Did I have sex with the stripper?
There was more crying than sex.
- I made her cry?
- Not her...
Oh God!
Look...
- I don't know what I said last night...
"- I mean, I really don't know what I said last night, but it wasn't necessarily the truth."
In Vino Veritas.
"Is not accurate, is what I'm saying."
"It's just an expression, and it's Latin so people give it more weight than it deserves."
Just what you see.
"With the Ministry's cutbacks, when someone retires they don't send anyone new."
And the weapons are from the Moroccan War.
So what's the plan?
Do you have what we asked for?
There's the clothes.
Here you go.
"Two Civil Guard uniforms and for you, a monk's robes."
And the explosives to blow up the door.
I'll carry that.
I won't argue with you about that.
"Ah, one more thing."
"In case of an emergency, ring the Abbey's bells."
And what do we have the phones for?
"They're worthless here, in these mountains there's no coverage."
The Spanish hell is everywhere.
What is the Spanish hell?
"Nothing, a joke."
You can tell it on the way.
Let's get to the monastery.
(Thunder)
"(ANSWERING MACHINE) ""This is the talking device of Ambrosio Espínola Doria,"
Grandee of Spain.
"If you want to leave a message, do so after hearing the signal""."

Message for Espínola.
Emergency call from the Ministry.
I repeat: emergency call from the Ministry.
(Thunder)
Are you worried?
Aren't you?
We have a very complicated mission ahead of us.
Romeo and Juliet.
"Act 2, scene 2, line 2."
The balcony scene.
That's-
Your favorite scene in the play.
I like that you pay attention to weird little details like that.
You do?
You're blushing.
I am?
I shouldn't have said that.
I totally embarrassed you.
No.
Amanda... you can always say whatever you want with me.
"Glazed Cornish game hens on a bed of sautéed greens, sweet-potato soufflé and asparagus, with shaved Romano and pancetta."
I don't think this is what we ordered.
Right. 'Cause nothing says romance like a smoked turkey wrap.
I took some liberties with the menu.
You made this?
No one knows I'm secretly a fan of Top Chef.
And no one ever will.
Bon appétit.
Stop staring.
I can't.
I'm O.D'ing on suspense.
I wonder how it's going.
You wanna know if it's going badly.
What you witnessed earlier was a completely uncharacteristic outburst.
"No, it's how you really feel."
It was just a mini meltdown brought on by some stupid homework assignment.
"The ""Who You Really Are"" essay?"
No one ever takes that seriously.
"Well, almost no one."
"I give up, Higgins."
What is it you want from me?
"Are you, by any chance, the T. Magnum who played on the American bridge team... in Sao Paulo in '72?"
"Say good-bye, Higgins, because the answer is no."
I will not make a fourth for your Wednesday afternoon bridge club.
- I don't play with amateurs.
- We are all Life Masters.
"- Well, then, you're better than I am."
"- Magnum, I wouldn't stoop to ask if it weren't a bloody emergency."
- What happened?
Your fourth die?
- Yes.
"Higgins, uh, I'm sorry."
Look.
I was just joking.
I quite understand.
Look.
"I am on an investigation, but if I can wrap it up by tomorrow afternoon, I'll play."
Splendid.
"Now, what can I do to assist you in your work?"
What do you know about Robert Caine?
"Well, only what I've read."
A rather obscure judge till his recent nomination to the Supreme Court.
"However, those who should know speak very highly of him."
- Shall I pull some clippings?
- That would be very nice.
Thank you.
- But I have to leave in an hour.
- I'll have them ready for you and warm up the Ferrari.
Splendid.
"Higgins, who died?"
Mr. Blackmore.
No...
Trevor...
You still got half an hour.
I can fix you some eggs.
I'm tired but thanks.
"Let's go, monkeys."
"Watch your work, not your ass."
"Come on guys, keep it moving."
"Yes sir, yes sir, Master Tucker, motherfucker"
"Hey, why is that machine down?"
- I am cleaning this.
- It takes 7 minutes to power up that mill.
"Where am I going to make up that 7 minutes, Miller?"
Your paycheck?
"- Back off Tucker, you don't sketch regulations."
- What regulations?
Lock out devices must be in place during cleaning and maintenance of all heavy machinery.
"Ocean, 1989."
Yeah?
Write to your congressman and hurry that up.
"Congratulations, Reznik."
You just made my shitlist.
"She copping his joint, right?"
"And he's tellin' her, you know, baby this, baby that..."
Chatting her up like mother fucking Barry White.
"Talking about what he going to do to her, and how he going to make her coochy feel and all that."
That's right.
"So then, she stopped"
She looked up at him with these big old puppy eyes she's like...
"That sounds good pappy, but me no have no coochy."
"So, my man's like ""Say what?"

- a nice walk.
- I hate walking.
"Besides, my driver's around the corner."
I have to go meet Simas Gort Morgan... and he's going to introduce me to Milo Norbuck... who's gonna be in the new CK campaign with me.
I can.
Should I come with you?
- It's business.
"- It's business, right."
"Page me tomorrow and maybe we'll have dinner, okay?"
Page?
"You know, Jocelyn, I have been inside all day... and I would like to take a nice walk."
- Would you like to join me?
"- Sure, I'd love to."
"Darling, change of plans."
"I have to meet Norbuck, at the Mercer, at 2AM... let's have some dinner at Raul's."
"- I'll take you next time, okay?"
"- Sure, no problem."
Okay.
"Antoniette, can I borrow your intern?"
The Doyle Gallery just called and... they desperately need this gown.
"It's the dress Kim Basinger orderly... asked, the one with only one sleeve, the one for the celebrity couture... auction, immediately."
You can finish this when you get back.
Hurry up!
- You heard her.
"- For God's sake, watch your back."
There are spies everywhere.
Trust no one.
"- Guard that with your soul, darling."
- I shall.
I owe you lunch.
"November, December or something..."
- our girls will figure it out.
- But who?
You knowwho.
And what about you?
Can you voice your own opinion some day?
"OK, take them."
These twins are like a needle and a thread.
They had it the hard way.
You can not even imagine what will happen to them ifthey are taken to our premises.
Take them.
Theywill make up fortheir guilt.
I've my orders.
I do not have the right.
And I have my orders as well and they are about our offensive.
So you'd better stay awayfrom me.
It is underyour responsibility.
Surely it is.
It is not your business.
All this war is only my business.
The division security section speaking.
I need Captain Shulgin.
He is in the headquarters.
- Kotov!
- Kotov!
Private Kotov reporting.
-Why have you been sent to the court martial?
-A intentional self-wound.
Yourfile states that you used to be a sergeant and had battle awards... including a Medal for Battlefield Courage.
"That's right. ln fact I was discharging the gun, it came off and the bullet hit my leg."
No one believes me.
-Will you believe me?
"-Yes, I will."
when I see you in the battlefield.
Everybody out in the trenches.
Quick.
"Hey, what's the matter with you?"
Do you want to get killed?
Not particularly.
"Hey, you two."
Outside with you.
- Must you two always be the last?
"-Oh, yeah?"
You try jumping in those trenches first.
Everybody jumps in on top of you.
How do you think I got my hernia?
Ugh.
"Go on, let's go."
Aha.
Aha.
Aha.
So it got to be Christmas Day in Stalag 17.
"You ask me, it was more like the 4th of July with all the fireworks that were to go off and bust the camp wide open."
It sure started off innocently enough with a party going on in every barracks.
"I love you, I love you"
Is all that I can say
"I love you, I love you"
The same old words I'm saying in the same old way
"I love you, I love you"
Three words that are divine
And now my dear I'm waiting to hear
The words that make you mine
"Come on, Animal, let's trip the light fantastic."
Leave me alone.
"Ah, don't cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive."
Snap out of it.
I wasn't sure if you cared about me being here and him not.
- I do not.
- Right.

"You are just like him, and I hope you learn to take responsibility for yourself before you destroy the lives of people who care about you."
(STRAINS)
This is really nice.
"Thanks, Dad."
"So, how's it been up here?"
It's been good.
I've really enjoyed all the alone time.
I'm sorry about the scheduling problem.
Will you admit that you made a mistake?
I don't think that's necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.
Could happen to anyone.
Was anybody speaking to you?
- I thought I was part of the conversation.
"- Well, you weren't supposed to be."
"In fact, you're not even supposed to be here."
I am.
Does that make sense?
You are the scheduling problem I was referring to.
It's just like Polish Hill.
"That's right, Jo."
It's the same killer!
"He killed those girls in '91, and my father."
Now he's killing women I knew and leaving them for me to find.
- You're scaring me.
"- It's scaring me, too."
All the women in my life keep turning up dead.
There is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and this.
There is absolutely no connection between Polish Hill and this.

Hardy went to high school with Cabrizzi.
That's two out of three.
I bet we can tie him to Cheryl Putnam.
- You want me to bring him in?
"- No, we couldn't hold him on that."
We can put him under review.
I'll call internal affairs.
- He'll be put under surveillance.
- He is under surveillance.
- Close surveillance?
- It doesn't get any closer.
"Thank you very much, Officer Sacco."
I'd like to call Detective Emily Harper.
"Raise your right hand, please."
Do you swear to tell the truth?
- I do.
- State your name.
Detective Emily Harper.
Are you a member of the Police lnternal Affairs Division?
- Yes.
"You'll lose Haley and Jack, screw this job."
You won't have a life.

"Morgan, I'm going to find the security office."
- Morgan!
- Right here.
- Looks like loading dock security.
- Should we evacuate?
"No, no."
We'd have mass panic.
Let's go.
Hello?
- FBI.
- FBI?
- Are these all your security cameras?
"- Yes, sir."
- What's this camera here?
- That's the roof.
East end.
"Morgan, I've got 4 guys on the east end of the roof."
- What's on that side of the roof?
Nothing.
No access doors to the mall?
Not unless you go through the air vents.
"Morgan,it's the air vents."
They're going for the air vents.
Don't move!
Put the devices down and put your hands where I can see them!

"Police tonight foiled an apparent robbery attempt at the new usa mall, which presumably have marred an otherwise successful grand opening."

I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
Everything... gone.
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
Which was more important... having proof... or being alive?
Trust me.
I turned away years ago... and I've never looked back.
Didn't you need to know?
We're not allowed to know.
"It's me, Cyrus."
"John, is that you?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, it's me."

When?
- Before the murders.
- Terrifying.
"Yeah, and there's no mention of where the mirror came from."
"Okay, well, where do any of these things come from?"
"Artie, these agents, they trapped her inside of the mirror."

I didn't finish high school...
"I didn't marry your father, and I ended up in a career... that apparently Jessica Hahn would think was beneath her."
I humiliated them.
"The two proudest people in the world, and I humiliated them."
I spoiled their plans.
"I took their fine upbringing... in a world of comfort and opportunity, and I threw it in their faces."
"I broke their hearts, and they'll never forgive me."
I guess I can't expect them to.
Maybe you're wrong about how they feel.
It was a long time ago.
"Rory, I don't want them to go."
"It'll just hurt them, and me."
- Okay?
- Okay.
- You should get back to your studying.
- Fine.
- Great.
- What?
I've already forgotten everything I read in the last two hours.
"- No, you haven't."
Murder victim.
His unknown killer is still at large.
Witnesses saw stein enter the hotel
"With a very young, very attractive woman."
"The l.A.P.D. Is now looking for this woman,"
The woman witnesses saw with stein
Just before he was murdered.
Police are asking if you have any information
"About her or her whereabouts,"
Please contact l.A.P.D. Immediately.
"Oh,my god."
I killed him.
I can't believe it.
I killed him.
"Ann,listen to me."
Listen to me.
You did the right thing by talking to a lawyer.
"Now from what you're saying,"
It sounds like you have a good case for self-Defense.
"If he was attacking you,the law says you can protect yourself."
"But in order for me to help you,"
"I need to understand exactly what happened,okay?"
"So one more time, but slower."
Lenny invited me to his hotel room.
We're friends.
And i don't know if it was his temper
"Or his drinking or what,"
"But he got mad, and he hit me,"
And he wouldn't let me leave.
He... tried to kill me.
Are you all right?
I'm okay.
Yeah.
Two this morning.
I swear those things show up every time the oil business goes bad.
-
- They gonna bring the kids in?
-
- They're thinking about it.
Don't these families have enough to worry about?
Hmm.
Coach.
Counselor.
"Don't report that, Esther."
I never do.
"""Sum"" means that we're adding."
We have at least two items.
"Don't make this hard, but what are we adding here -- protons and..."
Neutrons?
Neutrons.
Neutrons.
"So, David..."
"These protons and these neutrons, they're inside of...what?"
The nucleus?
"Well, don't say it like a question, son."
"If you think you know it, just say it like you know it."
The nucleus.
That's right -- the nucleus.
"So, congratulations."
Go home tonight and tell your parents that you figured out the mass number of an atom.
"Frank, ain't it a little late to be playing this song?"
-
- It's 8:30.
-
- Do not think of it.
- Will you not be seated?
- I'd leave a water mark.
- But permit me to call tomorrow.
- We shall look forward to it.
I'll show you out.
"Margaret, get the gentleman's hat."
- His name!
- To whom are we so much obliged?
John Willoughby of Allenham at your service.
John Willoughby of Allenham...
What an impressive gentleman!
He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf.
- Tell me if I hurt you.
"- She feels no pain, Mamma."
"Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress."
Please don't say anything important.
- He expressed himself well.
- With decorum and honour.
- And spirit and wit and feeling.
- And economy.
Ten words at most.
"- Change, or you'll catch a cold."
- What care I for colds?
- You'll care when your nose swells.
- You're right.
Help me.
He's worth catching.
Marianne must not have all the men to herself.
- But what do you know of him?
- There's not a bolder rider.
But what are his tastes.
I'll gladly confess to the fact that I'm an addict.
"I'm on Valium, LSD, coke, heroin, methadone, opium, Rohypnol   crystal meth, morphine, mescaline, amphetamine, vitamin C and D   hashish, pot, hash-oil, skunk."
I'm a word addict.
"Psychology, the Bible, Shakespeare   the Qoran, Donald Duck, Hemingway, Céline, micro-biology -"
"- Buddha, Danish poetry 1900-1940, KarI Marx, Nietzsche -"
"- Niels Bohr, Einstein, Camus, Crime and Punishment..."
"If you could shoot up books, I'd do that!"
And music...
"I just got tired, I think."
You know?
Tired of this.
And this.
And this.
And this.
I didn't get tired of Tilde.
"I love Tilde, and she loves me."
It's always been like that.
"Sometimes it's too much for Tilde, and she's admitted to the nut house."
"She only wears yellow, which should promote a successful reincarnation."
"Hi, Thomas."
We became sweethearts when we were 11.
"I showed her mine, and she showed me hers, and that's how it started."
- Good to see you.
How are you?
"- Okay, and how are you?"
Okay.
So everything is okay.
"That's the ritual, Tilde."
Are you okay?
- I feel much better.
- Give us a kiss then.
Tilde and me are having cake.
Do you know why?
- (MOUTHS)
"No, why don't you tell me why?"
We are so indifferent that we don't care.
- It's like we're medicated.
- How are you going to make us wake up?
I'm going to remind people what it's like to be really scared.
Have you ever heard of Spring-Heeled jack?
(LAUGHS) Spring-Heeled jack?
I've heard of Spring-Heeled jack.
Victorian bogeyman.
"Mask, red eyes."
Are you cribbing your ideas from penny-dreadfuls?
"They called him the Terror of London, and do you know what made him terrifying?"
"He could do whatever he liked to whomever he chose, wherever he chose, whenever he chose, and he was never caught."
"He just disappeared, passed into folklore."
"Oh, yeah?"
"- Is that what you want to do, eh?"
- I've already done it.
You just don't know it yet.
Are you sure about that?
Because the last time we spoke you were pretty scared that I was gonna ruin it.
"- Nice one, mate."
"- Yeah, I was, but not any more."
Why should I be scared?
I can take anyone I choose.
You can watch.
- Later tonight.
- What do you mean?
"I hope you're excited, because I am."
"Watch what, Cameron?"
"Hey, Cameron, what do you mean?"
"Look, what's going on in Exam Two?"
D.U.B. needs an ultrasound to rule out fibroids.
Good crits.
Vitals stable.
How about an outpatient scan and a GYN referral?
"Well, if you can get her in this week."
Done.
"Okay, next:"
Buster Freeman.
"Dirty puncture wound to the foot, waiting on IV..."
Could he sit in a chair for that?
"I mean, it frees up a bed."
Crystal Maranacchio.
- Waiting on an ortho consult.
- She's been cleared.
- I called the attending.
- You what?
That's a new policy.
"When we call for a consult, the resident has 60 minutes to respond to the page, or we call the attending."
"All the department heads signed off on it, except Psych-- crazy bastards."
Blaire Collins has been here forever.
I called the nursing home twice.
They were supposed to be sending a ride for her.
"Well, if they're not here in ten, I'm putting her in a cab."
- She's comatose.
"- I was kidding, Dr. Kovac."
Frank ?
Call Blaire Collins' nursing home again and tell those idiots she's been ready to go home for the last four hours.
Tell them yourself.
I'm busy.
Dr. Kovac?
I think I'm one of those idiots.
"Let's use the word ""alleged."""
They got photos!
They got witnesses!
"They got the ""alleged"" slut..."
Hey!
Let me tell you something.
I'm her husband first.
I don't tolerate talk like that.
"- Will, calm down."
"- You better get used to it, Will."
Especially when not even your wife will defend herself.
"Give me something, Laine."
Anything.
"Hell, just deny it."
Why don't you just deny it?
It is simply beneath my dignity.
Dignity!
Right.
We'll just have to make this all not worthwhile for Mr. Runyon.
What have you got on the distinguished gentleman from Illinois?
Some pretty good stuff.
"- S.E.C. Investigation, 1985."
- You got stocks?
I want something embarrassing!
Something sexual!
"Little boys, midgets, that sort of thing."
- Cows!
I don't give a goddamn!
"- Come on, Kermit."
"If we do that, we're no better than he is."
We are no better than he is.
There's nothing there.
Yes.
My name is Laine Hanson.
My address is...
"Youcanjustdothat , pull phone records?"
Iwork for a pretty powerful guy.
"Yeah,we'reclose, we were close for a while."
"That's till recently, of course."
Our career paths sort of went in different directions.
At least you have your life.
There's nothing sinister going on here.
"At this point, we just need... to look at every aspect of her life and find everyone that knew her."
You never know what you're gonna find.
- Did you find anything?
"- No, no, not really."
Not really?
You mean...
"A little bit, actually."
"I did speak to other classmates, and they told me she was pretty wild."
Wild?
"Yeah, she was wild."
Wild enough you can be sure the tabloids are gonna have a field day.
Have you spoken to them?
"Um, me?"
No.
But somebody somewhere's gonna talk.
- But not you.
"- Uh-uh, no."
- It's okay if you have.
We're not gonna lock you up.
"- No, I haven't."
"So no one like, maybe, the National Enquirer... or one of those silly television programs..."
"- that show, um..."
how much you charge?
-Fifty thousands.
Fifty and fifty do one hundred...
"Good, we go the three."
"Boys, it seems the Day of the Deceaseds, comes, animaos."
-Always with your jokes!
-It is possible that you never change?
"We go, Ciotti is going to begin the visits."
Let's hurry!
.
"-No, no, this way."
-In agreement.
"Boys, the women are as they are, we do not have to create problems to us, we must amuse to us."
"I excuses, Professor, you have seen the young lady Italia?"
Why?
Because I must put the injection to me.
You have that to put the injection?
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"Ah, the gentleman must put the injection?"
The gentleman has that to put the injection.
"I have understood if you well, the gentleman must put the injection."
"Yes, that."
"You come with us, we will put."
"One does not worry, you will not feel any pain."
"We already are, happens."
"-That is, does not worry."
-Bend down.
"Now you stand here, Lean here... a little more side... that is."
Comfortable position.
We open the buttock.
-The ass.
-The muscle Relaxes.
They'll send someone more skilful here and we won't go anywhere else anymore.
Don't be crazy.
Why didn't you keep the finished answers?
-Our methods are good for nothing.
-So we must use their methods.
"It seems that if someone gives you one blow,"
-you have to strike back.
-You think?
-What are you doing?
-Strike back.
-At once?
-You mustn't hesitate!
If you think...
-How was it?
-Fine!
"Well, that's it!"
"Hurray, we have it!"
-They haven't worked this out badly.
"Pick it up, the galaxy is waiting for our report."
"One moment, we'll just settle something here."
"So you see, an agreement is always possible."
Hush!
The planet is called Earth.
It's inhabited by living creatures.
"Multi-legged, four-legged... and two-legged."
The two-legged creature is called a human.
He considers himself to be the highest form of life.
He has gained control of energy... and invented a line of useful things.
"The lighter,"
"The telephone,"
The toaster.
"-Soft-boiled eggs, the food dispenser."
"Klinger, Colonel Potter tells me you're going down to Seoul for him."
Son of a gun.
Now that you mention it--
- You were planning on going to Seoul the whole time!
- It's only an inch from Inchon.
You sneak!
You stole three days from us.
"""Stole"" is such an ugly word."
"Shall we say, ""creatively acquired""?"
"Klinger, this is a list of pieces of music."
The military library in Seoul should have at least some of them.
"Please get them for me, will you?"
Thank you.
Gentlemen.
- That's the most fun he's been in two days.
- Get back as fast as you can.
We want a few minutes before the party to beat the daylights out of you.
Hey!
"Hey, Captain Cook, what about the big dinner party?"
"- You better be quick, or your goose is cooked."
"- Yeah, you bums, you!"
You guys are all talk and no food!
The natives are hungry tonight.
Listen to the pounding of those gums.
"If Klinger doesn't get here soon, we're gonna be the featured danglers at a lynching."
"What do you say we go see Colonel Potter, find out if he's heard from him?"
"- Yeah, let's keep low."
Maybe they won't notice us.
- Yeah.

"[Man] Mmm, be sure there's no slip up this time."

How about some ice cream?
Banana split.
I'll be right back.
I hate the scary part.
Them fellas I was messin' with this afternoon may be layin' for me.
Yeah?
"Yeah, let's slip around and go in through the shadow of the buildings."
I'll take the one with the white hat.

"Just for an adventure, I'll drink."
"Turn, my ass."
Those people were dead before they ever left the road.
How can you drive an RV stacked in a closet with about 800 stab wounds in ya?
Another murder made to look like accident.
"That's, uh, that's five in two years."
How is she?
My God...
Cumbersome.
Madam?
I'm a jewel broker.
"Since the announcement of my next wedding,"
"I keep getting visits from jewelers, decorators..."
"While browsing, I found in a jewel store,"
"I will not tell you his name by the way, these beads."
"These beads are beautiful, Madam, but again: it's not."
I m sure the Princess Danidoff would be very happy to have them.
Where are they from?
"Show them to her first, then you'll decide."
I will give you a great price.
And I have other jewelry.
A moment.
"Oh, look, I'm in a hurry!"
"If you decide to buy, meet me tomorrow at the Orsay railway station."
-Alright.
"Jean, please get Madam to the door."
"- Well, sir."
- Good evening.
"This is extraordinary, but..."
"I swear, my dear Norbert, these are the jewels that were stolen from me."
I have every reason to believe you.
It is this woman?
A receiver of stolen goods who sells the goods that thiefs put in her hands.
I'll buy them.
I have an appointment tomorrow.
Pay yourself.
Good morning.
I think you heard the news.
- Maybe.
Hello?
"Yeah, Kevin."
Hi.
Is he all right?
"Oh, thank God."
"- All right, yeah, come pick us up."
We're still at his place.
- Where is he?
"All right, bye."
"He's-a, he's in jail."
"Ah, in Oceanside."
He was arrested for drunk and disorderly conduct.
"Dad left some serious problems with the company, beyond serious."
You think you might have to shut it down?
Maybe.
Probably.
I can't go into details.
I can't even tell Joe.
You know what they say at business school... almost all family businesses fail in successive generations.
I mean...
- if Ojai is already having problems...
"- Then we should kick it to the curb, according to our M.BA."
That's the smart play.
It's not that easy.
Losing Ojai'd devastate my family.
"Come on, you have no idea what families can survive."
"Besides, you are not responsible for everything, Sarah."
You always took on everybody else's problems.
You could come back to North Light today.
You are on the fast track.
"No, that place was eating up my life."
"If we don't get a signal soon, get some back-up..."
We're driving towards Clare in a hearse.
(GRUNTING)
Fuck...
"I'm not going to hurt you, I need some drugs."
(GRUNTING) Adrenaline...
Something to keep me going.
"If you come with me, I can get you your drugs, and examine your wound also."
"There are soldiers here, they're looking for me."
SEELA:
Why?
I was trying to rescue a woman.
She's a doctor.
She got kidnapped by the Janjaweed.
Her name's Clare Somersby.
- The aid worker?
- Yeah.
She's going to die...
"Along with a lot of other people, if you don't help me."
(GRUNTING) Okay...
"So, please?"

There's no sign yet of Stonebridge on any of the satellite feeds...

What about Matak?
"(CHUCKLES) According to his office, he's away on an official engagement."
"- No, He's stalling..."
He's just hoping nothing will stick to him.
"See if she was arrested, as well, and get me on a flight to Khartoum."
I'm gonna have to deal with this personally.

So we headed downtown.
On a bus.
Almost fresh.
I got 'em on the plane yesterday.
"Thank goodness I saved 'em, huh?"
Barbara.
Mm-hmm?
I understand about Roger being a great pool player...
Fantastic player!
His life's dream is to play competition on TV.
But what I don't understand is the part about the gold teeth.
Ah.
"Well, um, his gardening truck."
Did I mention that Roger is terrific with tropical flowers?
And therefore I know he's gonna be doin' real well over here.
"Anyway, his gardening truck was rear-ended, and his mouth..."
Steering wheel.
"So, he had this friend whose cousin was a dentist..."
"Some friend, right?"
And he gave him a deal on these new front teeth.
The problem with tailing a bus is that it can be pretty humiliating.
"See, a bus creeps along while the rest of the traffic moves around it."
"Well, all the, uh, enamel fell off, leaving just the gold casings."
Yeah.
So that's why you don't have a photo of Roger.
He's embarrassed to get his picture taken.
Come on.
The next pool hall is right up the street.
Okay.
"Barbara, does anyone know that you've come here looking for Roger?"
Ha.!
Only half of Bayonne.
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.
I'm just wondering about something.
Okay.
Why does your father hate psychiatrists?
He doesn't hate psychiatrists.
"Okay, so why does he hate me?"
He doesn't hate you.
He thinks you're great.
Why are you concerned about what he thinks suddenly?
"You know, he's a puritan."
He quotes Proust and wears tweed.
He doesn't know anything about us.
Do you think that we should've gotten married before?
Before when?
Before coming out here?
"He runs around, spends my money on drugs and ends up in a mental hospital!"
"Oh, I'm so close to letting go on him."
I'm at the end of my rope here.
I think that what's going on with Wyatt is complicated and I don't think your anger is helping him with his problems.
My anger?
I'm not angry.
I'm furious!
"Because this is all about me, you see."
"I will not tolerate disgusting, degenerate behaviour and disrespect for me and my values--"
"Mrs. Jones, listen."
Give your values a rest for a second.
Your kid's in trouble.
Yeah.
"Oh, Jesus, Claudia."
Give me a fucking break.
My relationship with lan has nothing to do with this.
Enunciate and energy.
I have nothing to offer you but my love.
"I specifically said ""no geeks."""
But my mom says I'm cool.

I propose to you that your heir need not be a boy.
In this phallocentric society of ours--
"I don't know what ""phallocentric"" means, but no girls!"
So much for Plan B.
"That's it, boy."
You're our last hope.
Ohh.
"I just don't want to be here, Dad."
"Besides, I started a fire this morning that I really should keep an eye on."
"Bart, this isn't the kind of thing I normally would think was a good idea... but you wouldn't have to live with Mr. Burns."
You'd just get all of his money someday.
This could provide for your entire future.
- [ Applause ]
- Congratulations.
"You've just graduated from the most expensive and, therefore, best school there is."
And your discovery of the cure for the common cold--
"Hello, Marge."
"Oh, my God, this can't be happening."
[Crying] Next week was our anniversary.
I'm so sorry.
Are you married?
"No, I'm not, and I can't imagine what you're going through."
But everything you tell us can help us find the person who did this to Tony.
"I know this is hard, but I want you to try to remember that when you're talking to Agent Rossi."
Ahem.
"Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and relax."
I want to walk you through an exercise that's going to help you recall everything that happened last night.
"- What, like hypnosis?"
"- No, no, no."
Not at all.
"Now, just close your eyes and do the best that you can, okay?"
All right.
Think about last night.
"You and Tony, you went to the Halloween festival in Greektown."
What time was it?
"[Kiersten] Uh, around 9:30."
[Rossi] Crowded?
- [Muted chattering] - [Muted music]
Yeah.
Uh... there were drums and loud music.
"Uh, some people wore costumes."
Tony and I went to the festival every year.
We actually met there when we were in high school.
But this year we decided not to dress up.
- Boo!
- [Gasps]
What is it?
"A kid dressed in a mask jumped out, scared me."
Made Tony laugh.
"Cairo, city of the Lilies, a paradise on earth."
Silence!
Why do you forget yourselves?
What is this?
Where did this animal come from?
"Ah, oh no..."
"Cute, Ha!"
What an adorable creature.
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Well no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me!"
I knew the Germans had hired you Sallah.
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They have hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous!
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It is as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one....
"He's very clever, he's a French archaeologist."
What's he's name?
"They call him ""Bellosh""."
"Belloq, Belloq!"
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the well of souls.
"Well, they are not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy...
There is something that troubles me.
America's premiere covert intelligence agency.
"But now that the war is over,"
My mission parameters these days are...
"Agent carter, cover the phones."
...Different.
That all changed when an old friend
Asked me to become a double agent.
I have a vault.
Somebody cleaned me out.
"A couple of weeks later, my inventions..."
They start turning up on the black market.
"As of this moment, howard stark is a fugitive from justice."
You're the only one that can clear my name.
Edwin jarvis.
He'll help you in any way he can.
I found the man who stole howard's inventions.
He was part of a bigger conspiracy.
Leviathan is coming.
Who is leviathan?
He didn't have time to tell me.
All he left behind was a symbol.
I must determine what this means
Before the ssr catches up to me Or my friends.
"Clearly, you don't know the rules of the house."
Is this not apartment 3-f?

"My girlfriend, molly..."

"5'5"", blonde, works at bonwit teller?"
Next one over.
"Thank you, Miss ""I'm in love with Dylan the spy."""
Wait.
"I'm confused, because the papers are right here."
They've been switched.
How do you know that?
They're in Russian.
Because I speak Russian.
"Sure, Jerry."
Ask me to say something.
"Okay, um..."
"Say, ""I've been lying to my sister about speaking Russian."""
[speaking Russian]
And you wonder why I don't trust you.
[dramatic music]
"I swear to God, sometimes I feel like I know you better than anyone else on the planet, and then there's other times that I--I feel like I don't even know you at all!"
I'm sorry--
Why would you keep something like that from me?
Because I wanted to protect you.
I've done some things I'm not especially proud of over the last five years.
Like what?
There was a time I was running from arms dealers in Tunisia.
"I didn't have a weapon, and they were chasing me, so I-- You know what?"
Stop.
"You're right, I don't want to hear this right now."
I'm sorry about the papers.
It's all right.
I'm just glad that you're okay.
[sighing] Great.
Angela.
Yes.
There are things you don't know about me.
"But seriously, there is no question you are the closest person to me on the planet."
"The trouble is, officially the problem doesn't exist."
-
- What does one do?
-
- One acquires a frat detector.
Something that burns on a low light.
A little yellow flame which turns green the moment the frats appear.
That's one.
"There, madam."
I'll open the door for you.
Thank you!
"Do call again for frat oil, won't you?"
"""Quaint""?"
"What does she mean, ""quaint""?"
I'll give her qu--quaint!
"This may be old--fashioned, but it's functional."

- This here is an annexe to my wallet.

- How did you sell them lamps?
"Don't worry about that, Granville."

"- Oh, my God, what's that?"
-
"- Oh, me horse collapsed."
I'm not surprised!
"Oh, dear."
Hardly the thing for a quiet evening out with the one you love.
-
- What?
It's not so loud.
Good to see you.
"You, too."
Yeah.
That was great.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
"Nick, I really hope that you and Jeremy can get to know each other."

"No, I can tell."
Jeremy could really use a guy like you.
[Telephone rings]
Excuse me.
[Ring]
Liz is sick.
Cancer.
James mooney?
Yeah?
Jonathan goldsmith from the U. S. attorney's office.
I understand Joe nassurn paid you a visit.
That's right.
The police checked the address.
He's disappeared.
Ok.
"Joe nassurn has a lot of nieces and nephews, from Thailand, Cambodia, South America."
"They come through here loaded to the gills with dope, show up at his apartment long enough to crap it out or puke it up, and then he gives them a small amount of money and sends them back home on the next plane."
What do you want?
I want to know the name of the person who put your client on that plane in Thailand.
What will you give her for that?
I'll make sure they don't prosecute her back home.
Prosecute?
Thai juvenile justice is a lot different than ours.
He wasn't exactly fond of his mother.
"What's the opposite of an oedipus complex, do you think?"
Sir?
"He was reading Freud, who said the aim of all life is death--matricide."
Could he really have killed his mother?
"These, um..."
Background notes on Spencer:
"Well-connected-- journalism, treasurer for the friends of national Spain."
No criminal convictions?
No.
None that I could find.
What do you make of him?
I'm not sure.
"I'd say a man has to be quite brave to hold the opinions he does, especially at a time like this."
You admire him?
I don't think he's a fool.
"I mean, you read the medical report of..."
"Isaac wolf, the man who got beaten up?"
"I don't think you can blame Spencer for that, sir."
He knew nothing about it.
How do you know?
He told me...
And I believe him.
Margaret Ellis' will-- he had the most to gain from it.
"I still think that Spencer was the likely target, sir."
All right.
[Clock ticking]
Sam:
Arthur Ellis-- who'd want to kill him?
Foyle:
"I don't know, but you probably do."
"My guess is, he probably saw something."
How long have you been working on these?
About a year.
Can you show these to your friend at Gotham Comics?
I can... but I'm not going to.
But you just said they were good.
"So is ""The Hulk,"" but I don't have to like it."
"Your drawings are technically fine, but it just shows that you can copy well, and they've got no soul."
"I've known you for two years, we've had a hundred conversations-- about comics."
"You are a passionate dude with deep ideas, so I'm looking at this and thinking, ""ls this all you've got to say?"""
Aliens from Jupiter want to enslave the women of the Earth?
Yep!
You dumb motheftucker.
"Cans go in the blue, green is for paper."
- What's going on?
- I ain't touching those hands.
How did it go this morning?
"David totally dug my shit, man."
He might send something over to Gotham Comics.
That's excellent.
Check it out.
It's the Brunswick Monster.
- How much did you pay for that?
- What does it matter?
I predict this ball is gonna add 15 points to my game.
Friend:
Now all I got to do is get to Vegas.
Vegas?
"The Amateur World Classic is next month, it costs 3,000 to enter, but get this... the purse is a hundred grand."
"I don't know, Mick..."
three grand?
Aw...
"Gracias, mi amor."
I do not take orders from lady straw bosses.
Hey hey.
Was that Miss Krail?
Is she back in her office?
Pining for you.
Pining for you!
- Miss Krail?
- Yes.
"Everything's here all ready for you, Mr. Sandover."
- These are the letters for you to carry.
- Thank you.
- Lita?
- Yes?
"I'm all packed, all ready to go."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Well, I-"
- I just wanted to make sure that you hadn't changed your plans.
About what?
"Oh, well, Sandy, there's so many things that I ought to be doing this weekend."
"But you fly down there quite often, you said."
And you said you might even leave early tomorrow to be in Phoenix around noon.
"And what if I do, Sandy?"
Do you have something to tell me you don't want anybody to know you're telling me?
"Well, yes, as a matter of fact I do."
I-
- I have several more tidbits about people in the office.
- But that's not what I meant.
- It's not?
You promised you'd be there.
"Lita, remember the money I mentioned I was coming into?"
"Well, you're the only one who can advise me."
He studied in New York when he was young.
"And Yoon Sang Min is a Korean American, from New York."
"Although, I'm sure there are countless Koreans in New York..."
"And the man taking orders from all of them, our killer."
"And, working under Park Seon Woo, the suspects of our current murder case."
The two unknowns.
"If our predictions are right, and Chief Jung is Park Seon Woo's boss..."
It's good to look at this from different angles.
"If we catch these two guys, as well as Park Seon Woo..."
"We could knock them off balance, and get them all at once."
You could have came home to change.
Why did you ask me to bring you clothes?
Your lips are chapped too...
- I might have to work overnight.
- What case is it?
And your clothes...
Whose blood is this?
Hey!
Why are you staring at us like that from over there?
It's making me angry.
- Are you monitoring him right now?
"- No, no, we're not."
They just wanted to say hello.
"- Hey, say hello one more time."
"- Yes, hello."
I'm pretty quick with my wits.
"Something is... not going well, right?"
This is all...
because of that Park Seon Woo.
Park Seon Woo?
"I knew I had to watch out, but I didn't know he would come at me so fiercely."
- What's going on between you two?
CRYING
MUSIC PLAYS:
Shape Of You by Ed Sheeran
MUSIC IS TURNED DOWN
SILENCE
CRYING
MUSIC TURNS BACK UP
APPLAUSE
That's the demographic.
"The only thing I knew about Ed Sheeran before was, he famously had a Nando's black card."
I've always been very envious of that.
You know Nando's black cards?
"I do, yeah, I'm a..."
Have you got one?
Yeah.
"So that, like, gets you free Nando's, plus five friends for life?"
Yeah.
"Yeah, he just needs the five friends and he'll be away."
RICHARD:
Wow.
"Well, you're off the list."
"Do you know my beef with, uh, Sheersy?"
"So I did a gig in Dublin, there was very fancy equipment at the gig, so I'm there to the tech, ""Why is the mic so fancy,"
"""why's it so fancy tonight?"""
"And the tech is like, ""Get this,"
"""Ed Sheeran is recording an extra for his DVD here tonight."""
"And I'm so sorry to admit this, because I'm 41, but if you tell me this is Sheeran's gear, only one thing's going to..."
So I put it down my pants.
And a load of people took photos of it and tweeted it to Ed Sheeran.
"And he's like, ""That is charming behaviour, David."""
"I immediately got 50,000 new Twitter followers who all thought that I was best friends with Sheersy."
"And for this weird two-week period, everything I said went viral."
If only there were.
You'll notice the substance encrusting that rock.
Yes.
"Unless I'm mistaken, it's potassium nitrate."
- So?
"- Perhaps nothing, doctor."
Perhaps everything.
Earthling!
Captain!
Who is this?
The Metron?
"This is your opponent, earthling."
I have heard every word you have said.
- All right.
What do you want?
- I weary of the chase.
Wait for me.
I shall be merciful and quick.
- Like you were at Cestus III?
- You were intruding!
You established an outpost in our space.
You butchered helpless human beings.
We destroyed invaders as I shall destroy you.
Can that be true?
Was Cestus III an intrusion on their space?
"It may well be possible, doctor."
We know very little about that section of the galaxy.
Then we could be in the wrong.
Perhaps.
That is something best decided by diplomats.
The Gorns simply might have been trying to protect themselves.
Yes.
"I've this intention to learn, too."
You wish to learn kung-fu from my master?
Shut up!
His Highness is such a noble person.
"Master Liu, I know Shaolin kung-fu has never been learned by my people."
But the time has come for them to start learning.
"Your Highness, although kung-fu is for everyone,"
I'm really not capable of being your master.
So you turn me down?
Don't move!
Your Highness!
Please sit down!
"Mr. Liu, I hope you'll reconsider."
"Come on, let's drink!"
"Come on, cheers!"
Cheers!
Close all Shaolin schools in this area!
Yes!
"Your Highness, please don't be emotional."
Don't you still want to learn Shaolin Chin Kang Fist and Wu-tang 8-divine Sword?
"If Law Ching of the Wu-tang also refuses to hand over the 8-divine Sword book, what shall we do?"
I've got an idea.
You'll have the book.
I must have it by any means.
"Mr. Law, please!"
Please!
Playing chess is like having a sword fight.
"Strong, fast, and accurate."
"What a good sword, your Highness..."
Do you think your Wu-tang sword is better than mine?
I came here tonight to play chess.
Please don't mention anything about swords.
That's something I got to live with every day.
Where's the cuff link?
I keep it right here.
Always.
So I'll never forget.
Slowly.
Take it.
What now?
What now?
I think you know what to do.
"In light of the new evidence that's been presented to us,"
I would like to extend
"A long overdue apology to jesse cardoza,"
"On behalf of the city, this department"
And the district attorney's office.
"Mr. Cardoza, who is no longer a member of the lapd,"
Is a shining example of what this department
And all its officers should strive for every day.
"Hey, sweetheart, sweetheart, hey, don't worry."
I'm gonna be out of here by dinner.
It's all gonna be fine.
We can go to our special little place that we love
To go to together.
You remember that place?
Remember that place?
"Do you remember that place, huh?"
!
Just go to hell!
Huh?
!
You little bitch!
"you're making a really bad mistake, sweetheart."
One simple rule worth remembering.
I call the shots.
"Not watching porn or playing one of your computer games, Calum?"
Couldn't sleep.
Yeah.
"Me, neither."
"When we was in the car, my breathing went all funny."
Couldn't get air into my lungs.
That's panic.
Know the best way of controlling that?
Singing.
"If you sing to yourself, it controls stuff inside, takes your mind off stuff."
Sing what?
Dunno.
"Not sure the lyrics make much difference overall, Calum."
"You're Beautiful by James Blunt, maybe."
"That's an underrated song, John."
Much darker than you think.
"Like, he freely admits he was high."
And once the beautiful angel he was after spotted that... ..the curtains closed for them.
"Got to sort the ladies out first, Blunty."
Everybody knows that.
"That, or La Bamba."
"Remember what you need to dance the Bamba, Calum."
Feet.
Do you want a bacon sandwich?
"Yeah, all right."
"I'll stick the grill on, you nip down the shop and get the bacon."
What?
That's fair.
"And if them hoodies on the corner start getting fierce, just dance La Bamba in front of them."
There is one thing that is totally and utterly certain in this life.
It's your first real conversation since you arrived here?
Conversation that take place on or around campus and was substantial?
Yes.
Wow.
You must be really lonely.
Can't see your eyes in that hat.
That's better.
Where are you going?
Are your office hours over?
For the time being.
Also they're for people in classes I teach.
"That's not you, is it?"
"No, but I was hoping..."
"No, it's urgent."
"So today we'll be learning about the Romantic period, and the impact of the French Revolution, such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and..."
William Godwin and...
Did anyone read it?
We'll be also talking about the... (CHUCKLES) Romantic themes.
"Sorry, the cult of sensibility, emphasizing..."
"Sorry, what were we talking about?"
"Well, this is the most amount of visitors I've ever seen during a single session."
"And on a Friday, no less."
What a world.
One second.
(THUDDING)
Come right in.
"When I was in school, I never went to these things, so..."
I tend to forget about them.
That's okay.
I was hoping we could discuss my story.
Right.
Which I read.
Frank Lloyd Wright was too cantankerous to love.
Mies van der Rohe wasn't you couldn't talk to him at all.
Corbusier was mean.
"But Lou, now, there was a man."
"All my buildings don't add up to what his three or four buildings, because he, when he did get a client-- however he ever got any clients is a mystery, because artists don't get jobs."
"Every time I've tried to do art,"
I've ended up with a-- make much less.
"Nothing to be ashamed of, naturally."
I do it the other way.
I do it by numbers and-- and public fame and all that.
But Lou did it by being an artist.
"He'd sit and work on art , see?"
And I always wished-- I think he did too;
"wished he knew me better, and I always wished I knew him better."
(Kahn) Why?
"(Johnson) Well, you know, there's some things that don't go into words."
"It's animal attraction-- his mind, really, because his person-- to look at him wasn't much a pleasure."
(Kahn) It wasn't?
(Johnson) It couldn't be.
"See, he was so scarred."
"Funny, he never talked to me as directly as he should have."
Who?
Lou.
"He never came here, though?"
Didn't he ever come here?
To the glass house?
"That's strange, cause I built it in'49."
Possible.
Possible.
Do you think Lou would have liked this house?
No.
Why?
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
The third name.
"Yeah, the guy in Cleveland."
What about him?
- Right in back of us.
- What?
- Yes.
- Here.
They were staring at us in front of the hotel too.
"Jo, will you please stop imagining things."
(Whispering) I'm not.
Good evening.
You must think me awfully rude.
I've been staring at you since I saw you at the hotel.
"- You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway?"
"- Yes, I am."
I knew I was right.
"I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband."
- How do you do?
- We're Dr and Mrs McKenna.
My wife tells me Mrs McKenna appeared at the London Palladium.
We hardly ever see a show now.
Edward is such an old stick-in-the-mud so I have to console myself with your records.
I must admit I love em.
I'm not one for this terrible be-bop.
- Thank you very much.
- When are you coming back to London?
"- Possibly never again, professionally."
- 0h.
- Don't say you're giving up the stage.
"- Well, temporarily I am."
"It's just that I'm a doctor, and a doctor's wife never has much time."
"What my husband is trying to say is Broadway musical shows are not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana."
We could live in New York. I hear that doctors aren't starving there either.
It's not that I have any objection to working in New York.
It's just that it'd be hard for my patients to come from Indianapolis for treatment.
That's a bit of overkill.
"I tell you, we'll discuss it..."
May I take your arm?
My husband's in a temper tonight because I'm wearing his britches.
"George, Chopin does not deserve to be collected."
"He's so fragile, you know he might..."
What's this?
A secret?
Is he the one you came here to meet?
"Mallefille, if you can't behave, go to your room."
I am quite marooned.
Will you... partner me?
Of course.
- Bon appetit.
- ALL:
Bon appetit.
I understand many of you artists are atheists.
Atheists?
"Oh, no."
"No, we feel that God exists."
He's just not considered worth all the trouble of denying him.
"Oh, really!"
The baron is baiting you.
He maintains there is no scientific evidence of God.
"And I reply ""Because civilisation has poured dust on his traces."""
God has been buried by science.
But alive!
God exists.
"But he is no longer loved, so he hides away to conceal his broken heart."
(SYMPATHETIC MURMURS)
Certainly it is difficult to find God in our age.
And artists are the only hope.
- That's right.
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.
"Hello, Higginbotham."
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?
I'd like to discuss a few of my military theories with you.
"I'd like to have a little chat, get to know each other better."
"- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?"
"- Thanks, Cutter."
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.
"I got Bertie Higginbotham, his replacement."
"Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner, haven't you, Bertie?"
"We can look after that, old boy."
Take a plunge into this punch.
Punch?
That stuff's for drummer boys and old ladies.
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.
"Swill that down, me boy... and you'll think all the Thugs in India is a bunch of missionaries."
"That's right, Bert."
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.
It's all right.
"Bert, how about having another drink?"
"To the new comradeship, Mac and you and me and the regiment forever."
"- That's it, Bertie, my boy."
- I'll drink to that.
All right.
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham... the finest soldier since William the blooming Conqueror.
"Down the hatch, boys!"
"Kill me, machine."
Do it!
"Don't be afraid, andromeda."
Sweet dreams.
Thanks for stopping by.
Appreciate it.
Why would they leave us alive?
Let's discuss.
They think we have
Information they can use.
Like what?
What do they possibly need from a drunken nietzschean
And the captain of a ship
That doesn't function any more?
Maybe they're interested in your huge load of fruit.
Or maybe they have an actual chain of command
And they're waiting for orders.
"You know, if i was a bad guy, i would split us up."
"I mean, why let us conspire unless they want us to?"
Confident in their monopoly of power.
That's just overconfidence.
"If they're smart enough to fix theandromeda,"
They're smarter than that.
Maybe none of it matters.
I can get next to that.
Did i ever show you guys this?
No.
No.
It's a long story.
Anyway... why don't we go
"And see what these cowboys are up to, huh?"
"Rhade, where are you going?"
He has no jurisdiction.
"Now, why don't we try going to Tascosa."
Fight it there?
"The minute he steps foot in that town, they'll hang him."
vin:
Wanna give me some of them beans?
Might slow you all down if I'm going empty.
[DEPUTY GRUNTS]
Let's go!
[vin GRUNTlNG ]
MAN:
The hell you doing?
MAUDE:
Need ammonia and water.
"Mother, what are you doing?"
I'm redecorating.
"Yes, but poker tables?"
Selling liquor?
I thought we had an understanding.
"Well, I found those gambling tables in the hotel cellar."
"Now, am I supposed to let those lovely furnishings..."
... languishinadarkanddusty hole?
"Don't start with me, Mother. I won't sit back and watch you take my business."
Your business?
Where in the city charter does it say...
... thatonlyyoucan servedrinks and offer gambling?
You know what this means?
"A little war, dear?"
I'll run you into the ground.
"Well, we'll just see who buries whom."
"Well, then, the gauntlet is thrown."
Good day.
- What's happening?
- His heart's already stopped.
She's just trying to reboot it.
There.
That's the manual override.
- Are you sure?
- Just hold the tablet still.
[grunts] Shit.
[flatline continues]
[machine beeping rhythmically]
[exhales]
Sir?
I'm wondering who you have handling tech on Roger's murder investigation.
That's above your paygrade.
This isn't about Roger anymore.
I spoke to his father; he thinks it's an inside job.
"If we lose that supplier,"
"Spiga's current crop yield takes a hit, we can kiss our second-quarter projections good-bye."
That's above your paygrade and mine.
I meant what I said in there.
Roger was my friend.
"An asshole, but... my friend."
I know you need the help.
You don't even have a crime scene location.
How do you know that?
You wouldn't still be here if you did.
♪
My men scoured that trash dump.
There's not a trace of Roger Caplan or his assailant.
How'd you determine the location?
GPS from his car.
"Well, you can look there all day,"
I'm telling the truth.
I'm not sad.
I'm not.
You...
Face reality.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
Dad doesn't love you at all.
You're lying!
Shoot!
I let her influence me and spoke lines not in the script.
I'm lying?
Why do you say I'm lying?
Because...
All of you just wait for my move.
"If you have no counterattack, then meekly accept defeat and shut your faces!"
What do I do?
I can't counter her...
"Oh, right."
Because Dad carries my photo with him every day.
"This line... ""Because Dad carries my photo with him every day... """
That's supposed to be Lola's line.
Angel was pressured by Gong Xi into speaking Lola's line.
"Next, Angel's line should be..."
Dad carries around pictures of our brother and me every day too.
He doesn't just keep your picture.
They really did swap lines.
"Gong Xi made Angel say Lola's lines, and then changed Angel's lines into Lola's."
She actually has the ability to make Angel automatically collaborate with her performance.
Angel fell into her trap.
"No matter how busy Dad is, he always shows up for my piano recitals."
"That's because if he doesn't show up, people will criticize him behind his back."
He...
"Gloria, here you have yours."
Thanks.
You help me?
"But, if you obtain to marry you with Alvaro..."
I will live like one lady.
-Yes.
"Good afternoon, Senator,"
You have seen that we have gotten dressed as you like it?
Very pretty!
Precious!
I am hoping to you with the full portfolio so that you make it to me happen well.
Beautiful.
He will see how we will try to him.
"Very well I am wishing, it."
"Today I am in form, girls."
"How much it is going to give to us, today?"
Today I feel more generous than ever.
Sr. Santarelli!
Get up.
Get up!
"Mr. Santarelli, I have wanted to request the opinion of my colleague before making other analyses."
To operate!
To operate!
To operate!
So that wretch of Cicchirini me has spoiled it everything.
-And you have played it to you.
-Yes.
I have played it to me.
Boys?
we are going to give him to a lesson to that swine of Cicchirini?
-A double lesson.
-We will occur it.
Thank you.
Did I fail?
No.
I...
I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?
You won't tell him...
Most patients come to rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh
day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more advanced challenges."
"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, miss Porter."
Shall we?
Of course.
"Andifyoudecide youdon'tlikeit,"
I'll come right back.
Okay.
Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
"Roderick, do quit your ceaseless worrying."
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.
Perhaps you'd like some tea?
"Oh, that sounds wonderful."
"Now you just let Gunther know when you're ready, and he'll show you to your quarters."
It can be easy to get lost here until you know your way around.
Thank you.
She seems rather a bore.
Is she anyone of note?
I may want to live differently now-- quite differently.
I'm even stopping off on the way to the train to buy a new sport jacket.
[chuckles]
"Mr. Sandover, your wife is here."
My wife?
What in heaven's name?
She said she stopped by because you didn't pack your sweater.
"All right, all right."
Thank you.
I told her she could put the sweater in one of your bags.
I showed her where the luggage was in the office.
I said all right.
Thank--
"Beth, here, give me that."
Of all the things I don't need on the desert.
I didn't mean to disturb you.
But I suppose I didn't kiss you goodbye this morning.
All right.
There.
"Now run along, dear, for heaven's sakes."
"Sandy, I ran into Frank Sellers in the hall downstairs."
He said he was surprised to hear I hadn't wanted to go to Phoenix with you.
He said the company would gladly have paid--
"Beth, how you could have worked here all of these years and still be so stupid and gullible--"
"Sandy, you're upset about something."
You know you are.
"You didn't eat your breakfast this morning and last night you talked in your sleep again about waterskiing, of all things."
Please leave me alone.
Go home.
"Sandy, of course I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow."
I've already made my reservations.
[whistle blowing]
"Because when I go, I go."
JIMMY GUFFAWS
The little mashed potato monster's on his case.
"OK, Paul, I can tell you Anthony Joshua is not on our list."
THEY SIGH
But Joshua won his big fight against Vladimir Klitschko at Wembley.
"But the weird thing was, no-one seemed to know what the fight was about."
"Normally a girl, innit?"
"OK, all right."
"Fingers on buzzers, one more to go."
"OK, what do you think?"
David Beckham.
"David Beckham, what, you think he's very popular?"
"Well, everyone loves him."
He's getting more and more handsome by the day.
It's like a disease he's got.
"You've been cured, I see!"
Yeah...
"You knock 'em up, I'll hit it..."
I mean...
Aw.
You're a very handsome man.
"No-one's denying it, they're just reassuring you."
"Let's have a look at David Beckham talking about his tattoos, in this enlightening clip from 2000."
"What is this, David?"
It's a new tattoo I'm thinking about having.
I wanted a new tattoo for ages but I just couldn't... not think.
"I've known what I've wanted because I wanted something to do with Victoria, Victoria's name."
And I think it'd look...
"We've both agreed it'd look a bit tacky if I had ""Victoria"", just in English, down there."
So I've gone for Arabic.
Why?
"-Oh, stanley's polish, you know."
"Oh, yeah."
"Something like Irish, isn't it?"
well....
I bought some nice clothes to meet all your lovely friends in.
well....
I'm afraid you won't think they're lovely.
"well, anyway, I bought nice clothes and I'II wear them."
I guess you're hoping I'II say I'II put up at a hotel.
I'm not going to put up at a hotel.
"I've got to be near you, stella."
I've got to be with people.
I can't be alone because....
"Because as you must have noticed, I--"
I'm not very well.
You do seem a little....
will stanley like me or will I just be a visiting in-Iaw?
"I couldn't stand that, stella."
You'II get along fine together.
If you just try not to compare him--
"-Oh, he was an officer?"
"-He was master sergeant in the Engineers Corps, decorated four times."
He had those on when you met him?
I assure you I wasn't just blinded by all the brass.
"-Oh, that's not what I--"
"-Of course, there--"
There were things to adjust myself to later on.
Such as his civilian background.
How did he take it when you said I was coming?
"-Oh, he's on the road a good deal."
"-Oh, he travels?"
Good.
Look Mom!
Maybe she used to watch me from right here.
But she hated movies.
The only one we saw together was Dumbo.
Takizawa-kun!
I'm fine!
I wanna keep watching you.
Target acquired.
He's in front of the merry-go-round.
Finally found them...
How dare those jerks sneak off on a date...
Is this... thanks to you I remembered that I once lived in New York.
Get in!
Are you the one who called me yesterday?
Yes.
Prime Minister Iinuma's wife requested I meet with you in secret.
The Seleção aren't the only ones who don't like your request to become king. and she loathes you for it.
Then why does she want you to bring him back?
Mrs. Iinuma wants to hear it straight from his mouth.
And I personally want to see what happens with you as king.
What do we do?
I already deleted the new search engine.
Take the Eden of the East System down.
That should at least buy us some time.
How much would that help?
It'd give us exactly 48 hours.
More evidence of how incredible our Eden really was.
Eden of the East 000 NEETs in Toyosu anymore.
It's being used by people all over the country.
We have no choice.
Micchon?
I switched over to the wireless LAN.
It's only Fairclough's word.
And he was telling the truth.
"And that's what it's all about, isn't it?"
"Really the truth, that's where our loyalties are, not in clocking up convictions."
"But there again, if the truth doesn't suit you, you can always do what Charlie Fairclough did."
He invented it.
And no-one noticed?
"You have to trust people that you work with, unless you have a very good reason not to."
There's no other way.
So I'm going to find the truth.
That's what's going to get Michael King out of jail and put away a murderer.
And not by what your opinion is of me.
(Everyone applauding for Jack)
"Come on, back to work."
It's not Ladies Night at Masonic Lodge!
Mr. Mullett.
Superintendent.
Goodbye.
"Darling,"
Yep.
It's Inspector Frost.
Thank you.
"You're back, Inspector."
If you think you can just walk in here and talk to James.
"No, no, it's you I wanted to chat to sir."
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Barr."
"Yes, well the thing is,"
I don't think that your brother killed his wife.
You've arrested Sheridan?
"No, no Mr. Sheridan's innocent."
He's got an alibi.
"Your brother would have had an alibi too had he gone to Bristol, on your instructions."
We're going to do a full run of the first act.
I want to check the timing...
"Alex, please..."
"Everyone in place, please."
I know we're tired.
"Believe me, sometimes it's a big plus."
"Okay, no talking backstage."
"Music, please."
Last night at 6 PM the deceased's wife was seen by the fireplace in the cook's arms
"Where, when and who murdered Colonel McHarry?"
"Stop, cut."
"I said, stop."
The timing of your entrance was wrong.
"Your cue is the orchestra, not the lighting."
"The lighting didn't start on time either, Zeltzer."
But that's beside the point.
We'll do the entrance from the beginning of the song.
Music.
"Eli, are you ready?"
Ten to midnight
"A wet, cold night"
Waiting for my friend at the street corner
"My dear Dr. Watson is a partner and friend but, unfortunately, he's always late"
I saw you from onstage.
I had to come get a kiss.
"Do you recognize me with the moustache, Goni?"
"Alex, it looks so funny on your face."
How's it going?
"- Wonderful, knock on wood."
I hope the theater doesn't fold before the general rehearsal.
Where the hell is Alex?
And it's the first time I've ever sung.
You've dieted until you've disappeared.
Now I'm starting to wonder if you can be too rich.
There has to be a potion in here somewhere.
You need an Other Realm camera.
Everyone knows those cameras add a hundred pounds.
(doorbell rings)
That's Harvey!
"Order me a camera, now!"
"Come on, Sabrina."
We're not going to be able to vote for ourselves if we're late.
Self-opening door?
Cool.
"Not very safe, but cool."
(running footfalls)
Has the camera arrived yet?
Yes!
Finally.
Hurry up and take my picture.
Could we take another one?
I think your eyes were closed.
"Sabrina, I'm down here when you're ready!"
And sorry to anyone I woke up.
SABRINA:
I'll be right there.
"Okay, everything's going to be fine."
Uh-oh.
You think that happened because we didn't use name-brand film?
"Oh, look, it says the camera only brings you back for a few minutes."
"So much for ""Take a picture, it'll last longer."""
And you'll start to flicker whenever you're about to disappear.
Like that.
"Quick, take another picture."
For a long time now I have blamed myself for your unhappiness and suffering.
And when I think of the music I might have written if not for the guilt which has murdered my vitality all these years!
"But Chopin has seen a happier side of you, it seems."
You can't think that I...
that he and I were lovers?
I'm not sure it was a good idea of yours dedicating the Etudes to her.
Why not?
We are in love.
We can afford to be generous.
They're running away together!
It's a catastrophe!
- It sounds like fun to me.
"- Oh, I see."
Ever the wily peasant you are.
"With Chopin out of Paris, your music no longer suffers the comparison!"
They say Majorca is the most magical island in the world.
The sun will bake that silly cough out of your lungs in no time.
Think of it!
Spain!
Pirates!
Pirates!
Don't you understand?
She'll kill him!
She'll kill him!
CHOPIN:
"May we shut this, please?"
"No, darling, the air is good for you."

"Oh, what a clever thing to say."
How brainy you are.
Got a degree?
"Just cos you earn four times as much as a nurse, you think you can cheek Richie Rich, do you?"
"Now, that's what I like to see."
"A good, old-fashioned bobby."
"Don't worry, Richie."
"These days, prison food is quite acceptable."
"Mind you, it's not so nice when they nail you to the table and shove it up your backside."
"Well, Eddie, the long and winding road is over."
"The great god, public, claims another weary showbiz victim."
Huh.
"Oscar Wilde, playwright, arrested for his beliefs."
"Lenny Bruce, comedian, arrested for his beliefs."
"Richie Rich, celebrity, arrested..."
For going nicking down the local shop.
Huh!
Lt'll be the trial of the century.
I shall be tried in majestic splendour by a jury of my peers.
"Parky, Tarby, Lynchy, Sue Lawley."
- Annie Diamondy.
- Debbie Greenwoody.
"Selina Scotty, Maggie Philbiny."
"Bloody hell, what a fantastic jury."
We might be on for a sex sesh after the trial.
"Too right except you won't be there, cos you'll be in pris."
I'll be all right.
I'm gonna plead insanity.
Damn.
Let's face it.
You've got the evidence.
Let me out!
Hmm.
"Um, we had a fairly intense screaming match."
No.
"Wherein I suggested that you take your head and store it within yourself in a fashion that, while, while space-saving, might limit its exposure to, to sunshine."
"Well, that describes 95% of my employees and everyone in my family..."
except for my dog.
:
He's such a good boy.
Well...
"I'll see you later, uh..."
Randall Wilkerson.
Marshall Eriksen.
"Gary Dinkersfield, right."
"Great, he doesn't remember you."
Not great.
Arthur Hobbes hating Marshall-- that's no big deal.
He hates everyone.
It's the people he doesn't know that he cuts loose.
He just fired What's-His-Face.
"He fired What's- His-Face, Ted, and What's-His-Face was invaluable."
"Look, I can understand you getting upset, but it's not worth killing yourself over."
"Yeah, wait till you get laid off, then kill yourself."
Like What's-His-Face.
Although I guess now it's more like Where's-His-Face.
"Look, it was just two cigarettes."
"Okay, I can handle two."
"As long as I don't have three within 24 hours, then I'm not going to get hooked again."
What's Lily going to say when she finds out you smoked?
Lily's not going to find out.
I have a system.
"Ah, yes, Marshall's system."
"Hey, Lil."
Please.
"In consideration of a Tót family, I promise,I will look for it."
- Yes.
- But do not expect partiality of me.
Yes.
"Na, what, Mariska?"
What?
This is the aim!
This does not untie everything of course.
I hope so I may expect you to be honest.
"Who gets tired, will speak."
Yeah?
"- Of course, major lord."
- Good.
"What happened, Tót?"
"Nothing, major lord."
"Because looked at leftwards, behind my back."
Yes...that.
A butterfly was flying in.
Butterfly?
What kind of butterfly?
Well as such...on him is two yellow patch and one red patch.
And you meanwhile the make of box you deal with butterflies ?
I just looked over there only.
Did you just look over there only?
"But you gave a thought to it meanwhile, following it would be good, to take, to strike dead."
"Happened so, or did not happen so?"
I believed only a little onto its.
I suspected it.
"Look, Tót family."
"I am very grateful for your hospitality, but this may not be going so keep moving."
This makes sense if this gives us pleasure equally only.
-That's right.
That's where I want it met.
Impossible.
"They'll turn him over to the Internal Revenue, Customs and FBI."
It's not impossible.
Nothing's impossible.
It would be like trying to kill the President.
-There's no way we can get to him!
"-Tom, you surprise me."
"If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill anyone."
-Rocco?
-Difficult.
Not impossible.
Good.
Why did you ask me if something was wrong when I came in?
I thought you were going to tell me that you were moving your family to Vegas and that you'd been offered the Vice Presidency of the Houstan hotels there.
-I thought you'd tell me that.
-Must I tell you every offer I turn down?
-Let's do business.
-All right.
"Just consider this, Michael."
Just consider it.
Roth and the Rosatos are on the run.
"Are they worth it, are they strong enough?"
Is it worth it?
You've won.
Do you want to wipe everybody out?
"I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom."
"Just my enemies, that's all."
"Are you with me in these things, or what?"
"Because if not, you can take your wife, your family and your mistress and move them all to Las Vegas."
"Why do you hurt me, Michael?"
Our whole fucking lives.
- Tito:
"Okay, good night."
- Eddie:
Good night.
Show me the safe.
- I take the money every afternoon--
- Show me the safe or I'll shoot.
- I don't have a safe.
- Show me the safe!
"Don't shoot me, because it's gonna be worse for you."
- Show me the fucking safe!
- The rest of your fucking life...
See here?
The bullet shattered your father's vertebrae right there.
It severed the spinal cord.
And my guess... is that the gun was fired at close range.
- He's lucky to be alive.
- So...?
He'll never walk again.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.
Viejo?
Viejo?
Soy yo.
"Soy yo, Carlos."
"When you're working in a bodega, there's this unwritten rule that when some crazy motheftucker walks into the store to rob you, you treat him like he's king,"
like he has God-given permission to own that fucking bodega.
"You chill and you smile and you hand him the money, then you throw in a pack of Camels, for the road, on the house."
- What are you saying?
- I'll bet you that the old man-- talked trash with the asshole who shot him.
"- Baby, that guy was a nutcase!"
"- He never saw the safe, babe."
I think it's better this way.
"Yeah,well... you're wrong."
Moo?
How are you?
What are you doing out here?
"Hi,my name is Bella."
I think I may have found your cat.
"No,I was gonna try and grab him,but I was afraid he'd run."
"Um,yes."
Class of '92.
Shut up!
No way!
"Tommy Anzide,how are you?"
What are you doing?
AUGIE:
"Bella,you got ten seconds before I take your turn!"
"Ten,nine,"
Thank you.
Tell me you took a long time just to make me a burrito.
"Oh,look at that."
You covered your hideous mole with a Band-Aid.
Thoughtful.
"Seriously,just get that removed."
I will when it gets colder.
# I'll blame it on a place #

"At this very moment, in the town of Couer d'Couers  a girl named Chuck was attending her father's funeral."
"The only parent she had ever known was accidentally, inadvertently killed  by the boy she loved  who was, at this very moment  attending his own mother's funeral, who had actually died twice."
It was a blood vessel bursting in her brain  that caused Ned's mother's first death.
"However, young Ned had a secret gift:"
He could touch dead things and bring them back to life.
"I may not always be truthful with anna,"
But I am always honest.
"Difficult balance, that."
One that I imagine you know all too well.
Here we are.
Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far
With a whole raft full of volatile technology.
Not far at all.
Mr. Brannis' symbol.
"Well, she looks to have seen better days."
It's still connected to the electric.
Someone's using it.
Do you have another one of those?
Someone's getting very confident.
Hmm.
Bingo.
Careful.
Some can be skittish.
Very well aware of that.
I remember you.
Nasty little bugger.
What does he do?
The constrictor causes
Involuntary catastrophic muscle contraction.
"Bones break, I'm afraid."
It was originally designed for back massage.
Hmm.
Right.
Let's call it in.
"Miss carter, I'm not sure you've thought this through."
I can't bloody well leave them here for someone else to find.
I'm not suggesting...
Can you imagine Rickie in a high-security prison.
- Who'd supply his make up?
- Do you think it might be possible...
you not make everything into a joke.
"Angela, there is nothing to worry about."
"Harlin, this guy Tino knows, he's been busted with a gun..."
twice and nothing ever happened.
It's no big deal.
You know what I'd really like?
To be put out of my misery.
- Are you kidding?
This is fun.
- Fun?
Everyone running around all upset and rumors flying.
Can't you feel it in your fingers and your toes?
It's like being alive.
It is such a rush.
- You're out of your mind.
- Last year?
That rumor about me and Mark Hammer in the orchestra pit...
during the talent show?
"In that case it was true, but..."
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it.
It's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, Mr. Krakow?"
I thought a lot about what you said.
- Thank you all for participating.
- Not a spectator event.
Came early to get in some laps and accidentally discovered this circus.
It's a traditional scholarship program with a charity component.
Yeah.
So... (CLEARS THROAT)
Ever track down your missing boyfriend?
Brooke!
Are you joining us?
"Look, maybe I was unclear."
Go away.
"I'll take that as a ""no."""
"The way he looked at me, I wanted to cry, but I also got really angry."
"That's probably natural, right?"
That's a lot of history there.
I don't know.
"I think when Audrey went all doom and gloom on me this morning, she really got into my head."
I think something is up with her.
It's also Audrey.
It's hard to tell.
- You think your dad will stick around?
- ‭I have no idea.
He doesn't exactly have the most reliable track record.
My dad left us when I was little.
"If he showed up now, I'd probably punch him in the teeth."
"Hey, Fight Club, not cool."
- You were listening to all that?
"- No, no."
Eli and his dad have a complicated relationship.
And Eli's crazy.
I get it.
I definitely wanted to hit my dad when he left.
Maybe we can take that walk afterall.
Sounds great.
Aren't they amazing?
Aren't they the best French fries you've ever tasted?
I'd give them a silver medal.
Silver medal?
"- What are you, a German judge?"
"- No, but I've had better."
- We're gonna do a taste test.
"- Fine, if you go by the Printer's."
- Where is this place?
"- In Bruges, in Flanders..."
- it's probable in Belgium.
"- Yes, I know."
I see someone with you or with a bunch of girl friends.
- I went by myself.
- Did you?
- How many countries did you visit?
- I traveled the world.
I graduated early and got a grant from my college... to do a photo essay... as part of my thesis and that was incredible!
That is amazing.
I can't believe you did all that by yourself.
I'm so impressed!
So... were you scared?
They tried to stripsearch me in Indonesia.
"I got a little heat from my bubblelicious probe but in... other letters, smooth sailing."
And did you make...
Did you make any disposable friends?
"A couple, but no crazy night with Ethan Hawke in Vienna... but I still have this Moroccan family who writes to me."
- I have the best pictures of them.
- Really?
Then I'd love to see them.
Are you crazy?
!
Nora!
Here.
Thanks.
"She doesn't understand me, so I got nervous  and let the tray fall down."
- It doesn't matter.
"I'm nice to her and I even gave her money, because she needs money."
- I had this well prepared.
"Tom, it doesn't fucking matter."
Nothing here is prepared.
Can you make breakfast for two?
Two?
Right away.
Leave it alone!
Just leave it alone for now.
"It's okay, we'll leave it alone."
We'll leave it alone.
Just a moment.
Pull yourself together.
"Hello, I'm Josephine Reiter."
Franz is starting up a commune.
This is no commune.
I met Josephine at an entrepreneur's seminar.
She was my marketing instructor.
"Great, and what does that have to do with me?"
Actually this is a historical location here.
But now my cousin wants to set up some sort of Christian-Communist enclave.
- Certainly there are people out there that would be interested.
"Maybe not here, but in general."
Am I right?
Certainly you can turn this in to something.
♪ That someday ♪
♪ That we can learn to love ♪
♪ Just one more day. ♪
Wonderful!
Thanks.
"Dang, cuz."
You got to perform a gig at the shrimp truck.

"Well, since we're on the topic of regrets-- you not pursuing your music-- I'll share mine."
Years ago I had the opportunity to participate in Doctors Without Borders.
"It was a six month stint in Mozambique, but I decided not to take it."
Why not?
"Well, you know, dealing with living, breathing patients isn't exactly my strong suit."
That's why I took up a career in forensic pathology.
"Apparently, some people consider me awkward and off-putting."
"No, that's crazy."
"No way, Doc, not you."
Thank you.
"And yourself, any regrets?"
Please.
I'm a two-time felon.
I own four businesses now.
It's the oppa that acted arrogant before.
Did the owner change?
Wasn't this Daniel's shop?
Did Daniel say that he's the owner?
Daniel and I are both owners.
"Then, Daniel..."
I heard he was banned from entering our country.
I don't know that fool.

Oooh.
Big brain!
Don't be so sure.
Tick will catch on.
Just you wait.
"Actually, I can't wait."
"I have to go, if you catch my drift."
Nature is one call you can't put on hold.
- Be right back.
- Be right back!

Yum!
"No offence, but you scare me."
"What's goin' on, little bunny guy?"

Are you aware that your roommate is a hideous monster from another dimension with evil plans for world domination?
"Listen, a good roommate-relationship is based on a respect for privacy."

Aye.
Thank you.
I want everyone to make it back safely!
She says...
The communication line just opened on its own.
Did someone let us hear that on purpose?
Who knows.
But I never would've expected Tessa to argue so forcefully with the XO like that.
"She wants everyone to make it back safely, huh?"
"What do you think, guys?"
"That's what I intend to do, of course."
"We can't make our princess sad, now can we?"
To think she'd be so worried about us...
I'm honestly moved!
It's just like her.
She's a good officer.
We have until 0600 hours.
"If you call yourselves pros, you'd better live up to that."

What a horrible look you've got on your face.
Are you worried?
Or maybe torn?
"What happened to the ""saint"" I knew?"
I'm disappointed.
You're full of internal conflict now.
This is new territory for me.
"No, it's new for me too."
"I, uh..."

"Too much, too fast."
I think you're right.
Maybe we should go home tomorrow.

"So I'm the best man, standing in front of... 300 people?"
Mmhmm.
"And I hear ""beep, beep, beep."""
So I silence my pager.
It was a pager.
"90 seconds later,"
"""beep, beep, beep, beep."""
You got to be panicking at this point.
Think about how the guests feel.
Everyone assumes it's an international emergency.
"I know I have to take it, but it's in the middle of the ceremony, so I go back down the aisle, past the 300 people, and out the door."
Everyone must think China's invaded Russia.
Everybody's thinking China's invaded America.

"Come on, we both know you invited us here to talk about the ambassadorship."
- Guilty.
- No.
"No, Amy, you wait till you get all the facts!"
"- Hey, okay, everyone, let's just try to bring things we actually need for the mission."
- Really?
Then what is this?
"- Oh, it's a book of 4,000 essential photos of Nikolaj for me to show Jake."
"- All right, bad news."
I talked to Captain Stentley again.
He still won't give us permission to go to Florida.
I even brought out the big guns.
"- Left, right, left, right, both, both, both."
That's so cool!
"I still can't let you go to Florida, though."

"He said if we disobey him, there'll be tire consequences."
I think he meant dire.

"Great, Hitchcock's in."

- I actually had a question.
How mad would everyone be if I just bailed?
"- Shut up, Hitchcock."
"Obviously, we're all going."
"- What's up, squadron?"
"I'm airplane ready, and I'm T-minus 30 from my Ambies kicking in, so let's take it to the skies."
"- Yeah, about that."

Well!
"But surely,"
This is very important evidence.
"I mean, mrs."
Enright could have ripped it from the sleeve
"Of her perpetrator, right?"
"All right, tell me, where is it?"
Where is this bloody cuff link that you photographed so ably
At the crime scene?
We've been unable to locate it.
It disappeared...
"Just poof, hmm?"
"I mean, evidence that could prove"
That someone other than my client
Murdered victoria enright.
Yes.
So you wouldn't mind if they searched your house
"For that cuff link, would you?"
You're not gonna find it there.
Why?
Did you hide it somewhere else?
That's not what I meant.
No.
What you meant...
"Was to be judge and jury,"
Hiding evidence that would vindicate my client.
And you know what?
You very nearly succeeded.
Thank you.
So...
You folks need any help?
We're fine.
Just a little trouble with a tire.
"For your own safety, you shouldn't be on the shoulder any longer than necessary."
"We're leaving now, officer Thank you."

We're not going out today.
We don't have to go to briefing.
"I know, but nervous is nervous, and when he doesn't see me..."
- ... he starts to think I'm in trouble.
- That's just his overactive imagination.
I have a feeling he's gonna see you soon enough.
So the records of gasoline consumption and mileage have not been accurate.
Therefore the logs are gonna have to be adjusted.
The following officers will report to the clerk immediately following briefing.
Patterson.
Wilson.
Sylvia.
"Johnson, T.J."
Poncherello!
Get away from the door.
I said get away.
Excuse me.
"Sorry, sarge, I couldn't hear you."
"We couldn't hear him, right?"
"- No, actually, we're looking at these..."
- Baker.
That's aiding and abetting.
I don't want to see that face.
"Come on, we're not even on duty."
Mm.
"In the time I have known you,"
I have always sensed you wanted to be a good man.
Do you want what happened to Thomas to ever happen again?
Of course not.
"Then go to Inspector Mallory, confess your crime and expose your superiors and the corrupt system that protected you."
"Father, I'm not sure that I'm brave enough."
I think you are.
God has given you the chance to salvage some greater good from your acts.
I strongly suggest that you do the right thing.
"Afternoon, sir."
Is the Inspector in?
"He is, sir, yes."
Go straight through.
Thank you.
"Oh, Sergeant, there's a man outside, he's behaving rather strangely."
I think he must be drunk.
Is there?
Right.
Thanks.
I've got nothing more to say.
Mrs Lightman?
Who are you?
I'm Max.
I am so very sorry... ..for what I did to Vera and to your son.
How did you get in here?
I want to confess to the murder of Vera Blanchett... ..and to my role in a barbaric police cover-up.
You what?
I should have known it was too good to be true.
"Come now, Mrs McCarthy."
Not every man who invites you out to lunch will turn out to be a murderer.
And I didn't even get to taste the Dover sole.
"No, it's fine."
"Saul, this is my daughter Rebecca."
- Saul and I work together at Ojai.
- Oh.
"Yeah, it's so nice to meet you, Rebecca."
Your mother never said that you were so lovely.
"I guess Mom doesn't talk about me much, because I doubt she'd use the word ""lovely""."
"Becca, that was a compliment."
Say thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Is there any cereal left?
"- Uh, yeah."
Try the top shelf.
"Well, I didn't realize it was getting to be so late."
"It's very nice to meet you, Rebecca."
- Bye.
- Bye.
We'll talk more at the office.
Sorry about interrupting the mid-morning booty call.
Maybe you should put a sock on the door.
Saul was just helping me with the coffee machine.
Is that what the senior set is calling it these days?
"Yes, we are seeing each other, if that's what you mean."
At least that embarrassing little run-in clarified some things.
"The sudden windfall, the winery, the Maserati, the expensive housewares."
No.
Saul has nothing to do with any of that.
- Right.
"- Rebecca, I told you the truth."
A close friend died and left me some money.
"This is a good thing, Becca."
Although...
"I have to admit, she does seem a little different."
"Remember, the leaves must be dried and finely ground."
Like this?
A little more.
Now...
Why is distillation an important step?
To remove the toxins from the ferassin root?
Precisely.
"We wouldn't want the serum to send you into paralytic shock, now, would we?"
"No, father."
"Seriously,"
Have you seen anything like this before?
"No, I have not."
She is unlike any wraith I've ever encountered.
What if it's all an act?
"If she were a killer,"
Why would he protect her?
"Well, maybe the act's for his benefit, too."
"They live here together, Rodney."
"If she were like other wraith,"
He would be her first victim.
"Teyla, this is Sheppard."
Go ahead.
We just got back with Beckett.
Ronon's going to take him up to the cave.
I'm going to check in with the villagers.
What are you going to tell them?
I'm still working on that.
This equipment's remarkable.
Where did you get it?
"Oh, here and there."
"Mac became ""Dr. John."""
Seemed like a whole 'nother life...
Another person came in and started something new over here.
"He's a character, man."
- What's his deal?
- He's an original cat.
He's cooler than you.
And he's cooler than everybody you'll ever meet.
Did you create Dr. John to be a front man?
No.
"I was gonna make Ronnie Barron be ""Dr. John,"""
"and I was gonna call him ""Reverend Ether."""
"Frank Sinatra's manager or arranger, or whatever the hell he was, said, ""If Sonny and 'Cheryl' could sing, and if Bob Dylan could sing, you could sing, asshole."""
I think he hit a raw nerve with me and it hit home.
"He's amazing, you know?"
"It's like, everything that he plays is the best thing ever."
It's perfectly behind the beat.
Everything he knows about music is so pure and so... complete.
"It's like, nasty and dirty, but intelligent and, uh... you can hear a million years of music in everything he does."
It's that guy's bachelor party this week.
I fucking met that dude yesterday.
Right there.
That dude with the fucking headband and the sunglasses.
"- Oh, not him."
- No way!
Yep.
I told him we were playing here tonight.
And his dad!
He's with his dad!
What's up?
"Look, dude's in the headband."
He brought his dad on his bach' party.
And you know why?
Because they're ignorant and they're dumb as shit.
"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy."
- God damn it.
- It's the 12th Amendment.
- I have 20th Amendment.
- Why are there so many amendments?
"Get it right the first time, people."
It's actually both. 12th is superseded by the 20th.
They give the House until January 20th to elect the president.
Each state gets one vote.
First candidate to 26 is the new president and the Senate chooses the VP.
It's a close election with a ton of House races too close to call.
What happens if it's a tie in the House?
Right.
- Is it a dance-off?
"Well, vice president-elect becomes president."
Whoever the Senate has picked for VP will be president.
"- Wait, that means..."
- That Tom...
- What?
- Could be the president.
"Well, I..."
I had literally no idea.
It's good to be prepared.
"So, wait."
So you mean that I...
I might lose this election to my fucking vice president?
"At least it'd be somebody from our team, ma'am."
"I mean, that's good, right?"
I didn't mean to make her cry.
"There, there."
But in the area of death the ice is ruthless.
"Looks like someone had your bright idea, Bishop."
An accident rarely comes alone.
Sauber!
"It seems that your drug addicts friends are condemned here,"
What?
"Are we going to play now ""Cowboys and the damn Indians""?"
Only we are the damned Indians.
"Everyone knows the damn Indians never win, my friend!"
Noids have no combat training.
We do.
Re-assemble and prepare.
Check the Noid for DNA reconfiguration.
I'll contact the base.
I say:
We hide in the next camp.
The next camp is 100 miles from here.
We're dead before we get there.
Do not look so serious.
I will not let you die.
"Very well, little one?"
"Fuck you, Hatta!"
Accept the shit.
We contacted the enemy right outside the Death Zone.
The truck is gone.
Subutai has fallen.
"But we ended up mutated humanoids in the process,"
So it was a mutated humanoid Ash-393?
"Negative, but it has been hormonally changed."
We took a sample for an exam.
I do not care about mutated notions.
I want Ash-393!
- Asshole!
"So I don't care about a neurotical, I mean... he got me to stop eating sushi for about 20 min."
But then I said... seize the damn!
I'm not gonna be sway
"I mean... it's not that I'm dying to tear it out but... honestly, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
"I get a tapeworm and I eat what I like, and still..."
lose 20 pouds?
"I'd rather be like Karen Carpenter... on the top of the world, looking down on creation."
Wouldn't that be dreaming?
"But enough about ""moi""."
What did you say your name was again?
- Jocelyn.
- And you work at...
- Skirt Magazine.
"- Roxanne Rochet, I love her like a sister!"
- What do you do there?
- You know... this and that.
"Details, darling!"
"Are you a writer, a stylist?"
"- I'm a ""head plan""."
- Excuse me?
- The resident xerox core.
- And what is this?
I'm an intern.
She's an intern
She's an intern
"A pathetic, nulling intern"
Slaved little intern
Fax this Xerox that
Slaved little intern
Get me coffee Kiss my ass
Sometimes she may get the blues But everyone would spin and lose
We mean get arrested by the store detective.
It was just a pun.
We have every intention of paying for this item.
"Ooh, Eddie, it'd be funny if somebody knocked that lot down."
"Not particularly, no."
I'm disappointed myself.
"Come, Eddie, for fruit."
It is the absolute sophis thing to offer fruit after the meal.
So refreshing and it comes in handy for the sex games.
"No, not this."
"Look, ridiculous."
"Oh, this is disgusting."
All this fruit is crushed and bruised.
I shall write to Esther Rantzen.
"- Ah, the meat, Eddie."
- Ha.
Load up the trolley.
They'll have been playing golf
- so they'll be ready for hearty vitals.
- Look at this little lamb chop.
"It was probably once a pig, gambolling in the mountains."
Yeah.
"Doingy, doingy, doing."
I could quite fancy myself as a farmer.
"Well, it's a good job you do fancy yourself cos I can't see that anyone else is going to do it."
"Eddie, do you see this frozen chicken?"
"Er, yes."
"Oh, urh."
Frozen tackle might teach you not to cheek me.
"Richie Rich, do you see this frozen chicken?"
- No.
- I think you do.
I carry them with me always.
Until tomorrow then...
My pocket sonnets are yours.
A talisman against further injury.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Good work.
Marianne.
"You covered Shakespeare, Scott, poetry."
"When you know his views on romance, you'll have nothing left to talk of."
I suppose I erred against decorum.
I should have talked of the weather.
Mr. Willoughby can be in no doubt of your enthusiasm for him.
Should I hide my regard?
- No.
But we know so little of him.
- Time does not determine intimacy.
"Seven years is too little for some, seven days is enough for others."
- Or seven hours.
In this case.
- I feel I know him already.
"Had I more shallow feelings, I could perhaps conceal them as you do."
- I'm sorry...
"- Don't trouble yourself, Marianne."
I do not understand her.
Marianne...
- Haven't you finished yet?
- No.
Patience.
You're not going to deny us beef as well as sugar?
- There is nothing under ten pence.
- Do you want us to starve?
The plan worked.
I did it once.
I can do it again because I believe in myself.
"- No, granddad, my point is..."
"- Less talk, more training!"
Let's go!
"The more you fight, the more he fights."
"It's your ego, granddad."
You're the problem.
"I'm rising to the challenge, redeeming my honor!"
That's a nice way to say you want payback.
What's the opposite of a nigga?
- I don't know.
- Think about it.
- Mr. Rogers?
- Perfect.
Can you imagine Mr. Rogers in a nigga moment?
Of course not!
"So to end a nigga moment, you have to be Mr. Rogers, and what would Mr. Rogers do?"
He would follow normal white-people rules.
So if Stinkmeaner confronted Mr. Rogers in a parking lot...
"Oh, yeah, he wouldn't fight."
He would walk away and call the police.
And if he keeps coming back?
"File a complaint, get a restraining order."
"Eventually, they would put Stinkmeaner in jail."
"But then he has to snitch, and then I got to live with that shame!"
"Yes, dumb idea, Huey."
Stinkmeaner get away with beating me in front of everyone!
I never get redemption!
But it ends.
You're saying that I should just let him get away with beating me in front of the whole world?
"Uh, Anezka and her friends are trade-show models for the tournament this weekend."
They're here to take publicity photos with the team.
You're police.
Did Joey do something wrong?
NG:
"No, we just..."
We're clearing up a misunderstanding.
"Hey, why don't you, uh, go hang out with the team, okay?"
I'll be right there.
"So, you were talking about why you were angry with O.G."
Right.
"Yeah, I was angry with him."
But I had no reason to kill him.
I won.
Tendu signed with Team ProFine.
"Now, O.G. was furious, okay?"
"He kept badgering Tendu to change his mind, but..."
Something wrong?
"Tendu was supposed to be here by now, for the publicity photos."
"Called him, like, an hour ago, but he didn't answer."
"Wait, you don't think whoever tried to kill O.G."
"went after him, also?"
We can't rule anything out.
You know where he was staying?
I could send a car to check on him.
"We need to talk to him, too."
"I don't know for sure, but I bet he was at the same hotel as O.G."
There was only one room registered under O.G.'s name.
Then try looking under Tendu's real name.
I only learned it when we were drawing up the contracts.
It's Marcel Otolik.
O-T-O-L-I-K.
Don't you remember what you used to say to me?
You swore you'd wait for me.
"She was convenient for you, wasn't she, because she was here."
You took very good care of Mother and Zina.
Very good care.
What are you going to do?
Nothing.
I'll leave you to each other.
Are you alright?
"Yes, thank you."
"Oh, wait."
Take me to the police station.
Your name?
Clementi Sabourin.
What do you want?
I have some valuable information.
Information?
Concerning whom?
"Concerning a very rich man... who is in this country illegally, forged papers."
I'm sure you'll know what to do with his very considerable assets.
Anything we impound goes to the government.
Naturally.
What's this man's name?
"If I tell you, I want the necessary papers to take me to America."
If you are telling the truth... it will be arranged.
Alright.
He's living here under the name of Gerry Monte.
His real name is Sabourin.
He's originally from Czechoslovakia.
He runs a little antique shop near the Porta San Giuseppe.
Treasures stolen from all over the world.
Thank you.
"If it wasn't on a boat, I don't want it."
Stop buying things from Italy.
You are not a millionaire.
We
- We are not millionaires.
"The first thing we gotta do is find a reliable, non-asthmatic person... to cash in this ticket A.S.A.P., or we're dead."
Funny you should mention that.
- I think I have another candidate.
"- Oh, yeah?"
Who?
This guy that I was seeing when I was waitressing at the racetrack.
I think he still works there too.
A real sweet guy.
"Bought me a really expensive parrot, too, from Brazil or something."
My cat bit its head off.
"You hated that fucking bird, didn't you, sweetie?"
"The racetrack, eh."
"Well, actually, he's an unofficial employee."
He injects horses with some shit that makes them run faster.
Forget it.
Cross him offthe list.
Forget him.
Who else?
"There is Scatter, the guy who installed my carpet."
- I went to high school with him.
- The man's name is Scatter?
"Yeah, well, he's a total coke freak, which could work in our favor because he usually needs money."
"No, junkies are problematic."
Let's keep thinking.
Mm-hmm.
- Wanna have sex?
"- Oh, yeah."
"Then I took a second to get to know the guy, and he turned out to be a pretty good friend."
"- Well, um, I'm not here to make friends."
"- Yeah, well, mission accomplished."
"- Look, clearly, this isn't working."
- Clearly.
"So, let's just..."
"Look, you do the first half of the assignment, then I'll go over it before I put it together with mine."
- And I'll go over yours.
- Fine.
Then I guess we'll have to get together this weekend and go over it together.
Sounds like the perfect way to spend the weekend.
See ya.
- The Bait Shop.
Where is that exactly?
- I don't know.
"- So where'd you get these from, then?"
"- Uh, you know, uh, Cohen."
- He gave them to you?
- To us.
Hmm.
Why'd he do that?
"Um, well, he said he wants to be friends, that he's trying to change."
"Um, to be less Coheny and more like, well, a person."
- Don't you think he might be trying that just to win you back?
- No.
- I mean no.
"- Okay, let's just say, hypothetically,"
Seth really is changing.
Would that mean you'd want to get back together with him?
"- Well, hypothetically?"
- You know what?
Don't answer.
Long distance?
Chicago?
"See here, Mr. Norstaad."
I've been your leading representative in the Midwest for the past ten years now.
You can't do this to me.
Do?
I do something?
"You, Somers, who's ever running things--"
He's got a salesman in Chicago trying to saturate the market.
"Why, he's taking orders at prices so low the furniture bearing your trademark could be sold retail for less than I paid you."
"Oh, no."
"No, that's impossible."
Is it?
"Well, I've seen signed duplicates of the orders with my own eyes."
I call you back.
Parker.
I told you I wanted you to bring me some pieces to show to salesmen.
These pieces ready to show to anybody.
- I've told you I want production--
- But he's not in today.
If you'll call for an appointment--
"So now I need an appointment, huh?"
What's the matter?
You are hiding from somebody?
"No, no, of course not."
"Come on into my office where we can talk, Norstaad."
Aha.
"Ramsey from Chicago, he calls me."
He tells me that you sell furniture under my trademark cheaper than I can make it.
I want to know how can you do that?
"That's my business, I'm afraid."
"No, mine."
"Leaving, not going up."
"What was that all about - five minutes, where did that come from?"
You...
It's the human male from the Institute.
What's he doing here?
"Suggest we melt his brain using projectile acid fish, and then interrogate him."
Other way round.
Am I going to have the nightmare tonight?
Definitely not.
How do you know?
Because someone's coming to help.
Who?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Is it one of your stories?
Your definitely true ones?
Huh!
All my stories are true.
Like how you were born behind the clock face of Big Ben?
Accounting for my acute sense of time.
And you invented fish.
Because I dislike swimming alone.
So what's this one?
There's a man called the Doctor.
"He lives on a cloud in the sky, and all he does, all day every day, is to stop all the children in the world ever having bad dreams."
I've been having bad dreams.
He's been on holiday.
But I am confident he has now returned to work.
"And as a matter of fact, he's right here..."
"Aren't you, Doctor?"
Bloomin' hell!
The children have been very naughty!
"Get back, now, quickly."
- Buying myself a piñata.
- A personal piñata?
"End of a hard week, you just string up a piñata, whack the crap out of it, and it rains candy on you."
- It's the best.
- But I don't understand.
"Cookie, you were also buying a piñata?"
"Yeah, I mean, what are the odds, right?"
When two people who both love piñatas find each other?
Very unexpected.
"'Cause, you know, normally I date, you know, really tough guys, right?"
- It's what I would assume.
"- Yeah, bounty hunters,"
"MMA fighters, and large animal vets, but, man, none of those guys made me laugh like this man."
- You're a party in a bottle.
- There's no denying that.
"And the physical part is just... it's, um... seamless."
"When you say ""seamless,"" what do you mean by..."
"- Well, we need more apps."
- You don't know where his body
- ends and yours begins?
- You guys need more apps?
- Is that what it is?
"- I do, yeah."
- Who wants more apps?
"- I'm good, thanks."
I'll get you some then.
"Oh, my God, can you believe it?"
"We thought Nancy was gonna be some terrible woman who was like, ""my Crock-Pot,"" and instead, it's Cookie!"
- [laughs]
- You must be so psyched.
"- I am so psyched, really."
"- Oh, God, imagine what."
Come on.
Help me!
Those other girls already took them.
What?
"Well, at least we don't have to wear those ugly, yellow bridesmaid dresses at the wedding."
Yup.
"Now, you only have to wear ugly, yellow dresses here, every night."
This is the best thing that's happened to me since I realized that weird mole on my arm was just a Grape-Nut and not cancer.
"Girls, great news."
You stuffed Han in the microwave and you're ready to hit power?
Come on.
We've tried.
You know he doesn't fit.
The one thing he's too big for.
"No, I got Ilia Jorbich to be our wedding photographer."
He's the best photographer at The Warsaw Times.
"Well, he's the only one who still has both arms."
"Wait, it's the Warsaw Times?"
"All this time, I've been thinking it was The New York Times."
New York Times?
This is much more exclusive.
You can only get it in two places.
Poland and the deli in New Jersey that sells missiles.
This is amazing.
My comeback in The New York Times has been preserved.
"Max, I'm gonna go ahead and smile."
My life is good again.
"Don't smile yet, 'cause Sophie told me that because you said she had such good taste, she's designing our dresses herself."
"What was that, like a second?"
Yup.
You just went from the best of times to The Warsaw Times.
How are you?
- Good.
And you?
How are you feeling?
"- Thank god, fine."
You're still here?
- I have no complaints.
"Lights and electricity, nothing has changed."
How's your daughter?
Thank god.
She went to talk to Alex.
"Good, good."
It's good seeing you.
"- Yes, you too."
"Hello, everyone."
I'd like us to read the first act that I translated with the help of my daughter Goni who's sitting right here.
And that's my brother-in-law.
"I chose the cast with Alex, or rather at his recommendation, since I don't know any of you."
But...
The recommendations were very strong.
Yes.
"Hello, everyone."
Don't mind me.
"In any case, Alex suggested we read ""The Enchanted Nose"""
with the junior company.
I thought...
"Excuse me, dear actors,"
"I see you're taking the text out of the envelopes, is this the first time you've seen it?"
"I'm sorry, they only informed us yesterday, we're rehearsing all the time, you expect too much of us."
A serious actor is supposed to prepare at home.
"Yitzhak, don't be so hard on them."
"In the past, I would've got up and left."
That's need-to-know.
"You can't pull that one with me,jethro."
I'm your boss.
"Iraq standinby,ma'am."
I got your e-mail concerning nce corporal finn.
I assume you've been over his srb.
"Yeah,we have,skipper."
We'd like to know what's not on the record.
Finn wasn't one of my stronger marines.
Wasn't surprised he went ua.
He have any enemies in the company?
He was well-liked.Played poker.
"Not well,but covered his debts."
Liked to talk about his sexual exploits in detail.
You know how marines love at.
"How does a dead marine,stateside, send letters home from iraq?"
Wondered about that myself.
"Get over here,marine."
Sir.
"Meet lance corporal hagan,soon to be priva hagan."
"Before deployment,finn gave him a couple hundred bucks to pop letters in the mail to two women the first batch started six months ago."
"The second,three months later."
Got enough to last the st of our deployment.
Gonna need those.
Send 'em on the next flight out.
Two fic?
s... that a marinthing?
"That's need-to-know,too,director."
- Do you see it yet?
- No.
Keep looking.
"Abby,I've been staring at this thing for five minutes."
and you call yourself a hero?
anyone not suited to fight this battle should disappear early on.
Well said.
Archer?
I am compelled by Command Seal not to fight you.
I would die just like Rider.
Saber?
that's enough.
My alliance with Emiya-kun is only until we defeat the Master hiding in the school.
Or what?
Do you want to force me to use another Command Seal on you?
Perhaps.
I got carried away teasing her.
Saber.
as well.
I shall overlook your words.
the first thing we need to do is locate her Master.
Caster's Master comes to this school every day.
we should let them be.
In other words we attack before they can return to Ryuudou Temple?
Exactly.
won't they stop coming to school because it's too risky?
That's unlikely.
I doubt Caster's Master still possesses their free will.
That's her style.
Her very first move was probably to turn her Master into a puppet.
That makes sense.
we'll continue our investigation of the school.
we strike.
but how do we look for them?
That's our homework for next time.
We're all tired.
Take charge of the starboard gangway.
- Keep the prisoner below.
- Flagship's jolly boat alongside!
- Take me to the captain!
"- This way, sir."
"He came with the prize-ships, and stayed with the admiral."
- I've brought an urgent dispatch.
- Give that to me.
It's happened!
They've done it at Spithead!
The fleet mutinied!
- The Admiralty agreed to this?
"- Every item, sir."
All you asked for.
Look.
Full pardon for all those involved has been signed by His Majesty the king.
"- This changes things, don't it?"
- It changes everything.
"Well, lads, you heard the news!"
What happens to us?
"I'll go to the admiral, and I'm sure I can promise you everything you wish."
So long as I leave an orderly ship behind me.
I want all officers set free immediately!
Bring them on deck!
You can't let them go!
You're throwing it all away!
"Jenkins, release the midshipmen!"
- Release the officers.
- Release the officers.
"Please come on deck, sir."
- What happened?
- Mutiny's over.
"I mean, we both do."
"Ryan, that's enough."
[Sighs]
"Hello, Peter, it's Geoffrey Barkway."
I wonder if you are available.
I'd like you to speak at my conference on human justice.
"Tell me honestly, does my bum look big in this?"
I prefer the pinstripe.
"Now, ties."
What about classic green or this rather happening yellow number?
What do we think?
If you don't get a move on you'll miss the conference.
All right!
OK.
"You have yourself a very, very well-deserved holiday."
"Thank you, I will."
I hope the speech goes well.
Thanks.
"Lyle, don't forget the good name of Kingdom  Kingdom lies in your hands."
And in Scott's.
You may need to be quite firm.
"Don't worry, cometh the hour, cometh the man, and I ameth the man."
"Ahoy, shipmates!"
"- Bon voyage, Mr Snell."
- Wait for me!
- What are you doing?
"- I wouldn't want to miss the party, would I?"
"It's a conference, Simon, a serious conference."
(Starts car)
I'd like to begin by welcoming you to this keynote presentation on the essentially universal subject of human justice.
Given by a small-town solicitor from Market Shipborough.
"- Uh, yeah."
We got rid of that.
Okay?
- Yeah.
"Anyway, speaking of engaged, check out what got back from being resized."
"Oh, my God."
Look at the size of that rock.
"Barney, you don't start with the ""I got caught cheating"" diamond."
You give yourself room to grow.
- It's a family heirloom.
- Yeah.
I got a few dirty looks from Barney's half sister over Christmas.
So I had to sit her down and explain very respectfully that she can suck it.
Okay.
I gotta bounce.
- Stop saying that.
- This deejay from Dubai... is spinning at an abandoned loading dock in Bushwick.
I'm worried I don't have enough layers.
So what if my friends thought it was doomed?
I was still young.
And I knew that a night of partying with a girl over a decade younger than me...
- would be a total...
- Disaster.
"I mean, she's like an entirely different species."
And I definitely didn't have enough layers.
I didn't understand half the words she was saying.
"To me, it all sounded like hipster Mad Libs."
Didn't you check your phone?
"I just ""means of contacting"" you on ""currently hot social networking site."""
"The show's been moved to ""New York neighborhood you've never heard of."""
Oh.
Wow.
He gave to the cops?
He would not!
"He was on their side, get it?"
Why would he do that?
Ask your sister.
-Relax.
Nobody knows anything.
What happened with Siri?
Nothing.
-They Paid for the funeral.
I think they're angry now.
The club has a code of honor when it comes to girls.
"If Siri does not know anything, she's safe."
The police would take Christer Johansson's death at some point?
-I Do not know.
-You Can tell us about the circumstances?
The police would not comment on the report in VG today.
We comment on the technical findings?
No.
-You Can come here after?
-Of Course.
With thousand of these newspapers he will buy a new iPhone.
Good morning to everyone!
"It will be a tough day, but we will do better."
The moderation of the OS is not something to which we are accustomed.
But there is something interesting in the Oslo police files.
"A car seized a girl who can be Zana, highway E6 in Mastemyr."
"Get nothing else from her, and she looked troubled, then they took her to the psychiatric hospital."
She's there?
"-negative, She ran away."
"They warned the police, but no one found it."
Find out if it was Zana.
See you later.
[phone rings]
All right.
So?
How'd you get on?
"What, totally empty?"
I tried.
I'll drive myself.
I've got a nice new car there.
See you in a bit.
"Make it look good, eh?"
"I already have, Jimmy."
I already have.

More protestors?
Guess some folks from the church must've gotten wind of the festivities.
I'm still so shocked that that kind of anti-semitism exists down here.
"Yes, well, it may not be just the Jewish thing."
"Yeah, but still, they're just backwards, pigheaded philistines."
Some people have taken issue with our age difference.
"Well, she could be younger."
"I mean, hey."
"[Chuckles] Yes, well, legally, I suppose she could, but I couldn't very well push her down the aisle in a stroller."

"You have, so nothing should stop you from grabbing onto it and holding onto it forever."

"This makes me really, really angry."
They're gonna ruin everything.
"Nate, go get rid of them."
"No, no, no."

"Please have it, Please!"

Then make your head cool and take coconut.
"Then sit under the coconut tree,"
"Not coconut, why you're saying coconut?"
"You gave my money or I'll take it, Sorry!"
May I have water?
"Jia Jee, someone fire a bullet."
It's not like that you call some guys here to kill me.
"There are nobody, Jiaa, M.M. Munday not enough, not less."
Bubble Gum.
Very much.
"But Munday won't afraid to any bad guy, you just wait here I'll be back."

"Sir, I didn't came here to kill you."
I didn't came here to kill you.
"Sir, trust me, I didn't came to kill."
Then whom you came to kill?
- Dad hated jelly beans.
- He liked the cherry ones.
- He said they taste like cough syrup.
The only candy your father really liked is Almond Joy.
Don't ask me why.
"But get what you want, get what you want."
Not if Dad hated them.
Yael.
What was Dad like before he met Mom?
"He didn't smell as good, but he was the golden boy to my black sheep."
"He did everything right, a mother's dream."
"Hardworking, athletic, ambitious."
"That wasn't getting him laid, so he went through a tortured-artist phase."
- Where are his paintings?
"- No, no, no, not that kind of artist."
A performance artist.
He did weird stuff like paint his whole body silver and stand naked on the war memorial reciting bad poetry.
- Why?
- To get laid.
"It worked, too."
He met your mom when he hired her to dance barefoot in his Feet Me in St. Louis installation.
But he was always broke.
"It wasn't really his true nature, and your mom wanted kids."
"So he took his engineering degree, got a real job, moved to suburbia."
I'm never getting married.
It's death.
You're a little young to have reached that conclusion.

'Cause it's death.

I can see it's gonna be a scintillating evening with everyone cracking brillo gags like that one.
Yeah.
Hey.
Maybe there's a series in it.
Dinner At Richie's.
An ultra-sophis chat show.
Good evening.
This is the BBC.
"Tonight, Sir Richie Rich will be talking to the Queen, the Pope and, of course, the Tarby."
It'd be a disaster.
You'd get drunk and make a pass at the Pope for wearing a dress.
Bloody good telly though.

"She said, ""Baby, I'm not a punk."
I'm a survivor.
"That's what the hell I am."""
"You don't mess with people from Oakland, folks."
You just don't do it.

"Uh... can y'all keep it down, please?"
I'm trying to set up my new wireless headphones.
Gonna make my walkman sound amazing.
This is ridiculous.
"I'm trying to keep things on the down-low, and you three went on the biggest shopping spree since Ellen at a Men's Wearhouse sale."
"Oh, wait a minute."
Wait a minute.
"Han, why are you taller than the counter?"
Just been eating right and getting enough sleep.
"Yeah, something's weird."
You're almost the height of an adult penguin.
Fine!
I treated myself to lifts.
I was sick of being nose to butt with everyone on the subway.
Check out Caroline's Instagram.
Looks like they're in more trouble than I was the last time I tried to put on overalls.
"Ooh, they're on a tugboat filled with toilets, and she writes, ""Help."
"Please send money."""
So... quick unfollow?
Or sleep on it and pow-wow in the morning?
No.
We have to help them.
I lost the cord to these headphones anyway.
"Oh, still got toilet boat legs."
"Ugh, this place reeks of bait."

"And for the first time in history, even the train from Hungary is on time!"
"If I had wheels, I'd always be on time."
Hey cornflake!
Do you breathe at night?
"In Budapest, we hoped that everything was better here - even sleep."
Is that why you're wearing your best pajamas?
These are all I have.
I'm not rich.
"But, my mother was French."
Is French all you speak?
"He speaks lingo with his mouth, Yugoslav with his hands,"
"Japanese with his feet, Arabic with the ladies, and French with his..."
Fuck!

Drop what?
"It means, crawl off, like when you stamp on something creepy with your clog."
You dig clogs?
of course!
"Clogs, dig..."
Me... my father died a year back.
"My mother three months later, because she loved him."
We need foreign invitations to leave Hungary.
"The daughter of the sister of my mother who is a movie star - do you say ""star""?"
Yes!
I am a criminal!
The people of the crime world are scared of me!
I am a disgrace on the name of humanity!
I know!
I know that you hate me!
You think Im not a nice man!
But I believe that no man in the world is bad.
No one is a born criminal!
No thief robs forthe sake of pleasure.
No criminal commits any crime for his pleasure.
No prostitute sells her body for her pleasure.
Time and circumstances.
Time and circumstances force a person to become bad!
And you know very well that a person who dies due to..
"..poverty or starvation, his final riots are not conducted."
"From that time.. from that time, I have Iearntjust one.."
"..thing from life, I have understoodjust one thing.."
..from life that it is not a crime or a sin to be born..
"..as a poor, but dying due to poverty.."
"..is the biggest crime, the biggest sin!"
Bravo!
Bravo!
It is the biggest crime..
-Thats our hero!
Heres our hero!
wonderful.
Mind blowing.
My discovery!
Cut!
"I swear upon God, you were outstanding!"
The truth is that I have been happyjust twice.
Sustained blood loss?
"Essentially, yes."
"Poor Number Four had, er..."
"Epstein-Barr, but I don't think that's what took him in the end."
You buried them in your garden like gerbils.
"- My God, they were human beings!"
- Precisely.
"You see, the depravity of the human heart knows no bounds."
"Name your blackest desires, and somewhere, out in the sweating mass of humanity, you'll find someone all too happy to gratify them."
These men were clearly ill.
Men?
Number Three was a lady.
"I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong."
"I had everything, on paper."
Came from a good family.
Met my wife.
Had a family of my own.
It wasn't enough.
I felt... ordinary.
But with Richard and Emma...
"well, I'm special."
Not that special.
There were six others before you.
Out of billions.
I matter here.
- I'm happy.
- See?
"But one day, all this... will kill you."
"Well, better a short life filled with pleasure than a long one searching forjoy."
"You see, you may not understand our little arrangement here, but at least accept it works."
"Oh, take two."
We want you to be big and strong.

That's Leo speaking.
That's not even Dr. Bryar.
"Why don't you let him think for himself, Leo?"
You...
Can you see him?
"- Yeah, he's right there."
- Shoot this kid.
Why don't you let him make his own decisions?
Shoot him!
The voices.
"They helped you, right?"
It's where you get your ideas from.
"While the other kids were outside in the playground, you were inside reading, studying, learning."
The voices wouldn't stop.
They helped you understand things that other people could never realize and...
"Then as you grew older, it became almost a responsibility."
Right?
A responsibility to use that ability.
To use your knowledge.
String theory.
The Theory of Everything.
"Shoot him, Ted."
"Then M-Theory, encompassing all the strings, unifying the theories."
"- Don't push him, Reid."
- You know what's funny?
Most people say that M-Theory can never be proved because the mathematical tools do not yet exist.
- Don't push him.
"- But you see it, right?"
Am I right?
"Finally you have come, Alvaro."
It takes a life to wait.
They have taken half an hour to surround it.
"We go, we go, raises."
"By the way, I and you have put a card?"
"Yes, yes."
"For the women, those romantic details are fundamental."
"Clearly, it is her birthday."
You are sure we will find that she is there?
"Yes, I followed her without account occurred, you will see that it contents is put when she sees me."
"We go, if one does not melt."
You will see that surprise.
"Good afternoon, I hope not to have mistaken, Im looking for Lella."
"Yes, she is here, it happens."
I knew that she was making practical with you.
"Yes, it makes practical, anyway, she is very good,"
-she is an authentic professional.
-Where is she?
-She is with a client.
-Alone?
"Yes, clearly."
What is that package?
A thing that to Lella she likes much.
-You embosoms it to me?
"-No, no, it is only for Lella."
"What a shame, everybody needs incentive for their erotic fantasies."
-Why you do not call to Lella?
"-She will be here, in five minutes."
Five minutes?
Not if it holds.
"Endurance, hold yourself."
"It is not necessary, already I feel..."
"I left my spot empty, indicated in the pictures."
This empty seat is mine.
They're two men I knew.
I lived with this man with the blurry face...
The other...
Is a friend.
"He still is, by the way."
That's one of the first pictures where I put white inside...
Inside the picture itself...
I really enjoyed it.
I also liked the mouvement of one the characters.
It's the first picture on which I made the outlines blurry.
Very blurry.
But only to let this white in.
"The white of the frame, inside the picture itself."
"It's very London-ish, isn't it?"
I've never been.
That's true.
Where is this window?
Where do you think?
"The order, the greenery, the grass..."
"The fields, the trees.."
It's Britain...
Britain...
The heart of civilization.
It seemed to me...
Strangely I took this picture while I wasn't feeling well...
"When I wasn't feeling well, I took very ordered pictures."
"Very composed, with this..."
There's a little string.
"A little string of a roller blind, ready cover the whole image."
So you took this picture to show something of Britain?
"Bolin is bending two full stacks of earth discs at once, which would normally be illegal."
"But then again, he's fighting three waterbenders, so all rules are out the window."
Tell me who sent you!
It was Varrick.
"Please don't hurt me, Nuktuk!"
I think this is our cue to exit.
Where do you think you're going?
It's a knockout!
They're falling back.
Varrick's plan was to kidnap you and blame it on the north.
Then Republic City would have no choice but to join the war on the side of the South.
"I can't believe Varrick would do something like this, and no one saw it coming."
"Actually, someone did."
Remember Mako?
You've got a great officer on your hands.
He's one of the best.
Mwah!
I can't believe my boyfriend is a real-life hero.
Boyfriend?
"Wait, stop."
I thought you said we weren't a couple.
You really are as dumb as those rocks.
Of course we're a couple.
"Bolin, you saved the president."
And you proved Mako was right all along.
We have to go tell him what happened.
Yeah.
"Oh, you meant right now."
- President Raiko...
"- Avatar Korra, what's wrong?"
"Sir, I know I've asked for your help before, but things have changed."
Unalaq doesn't just want to take over the South anymore.
"He does it more nicely, than the mom or me."
Wow.

"One of the more beautiful ones, than the other one."

No.
No.
But...for major lord... a lot may allow everything to himself.
"That, if i it would be done, and its news would be going in the village, and...well..."
"Do not speak more, dear Tót lord."

they pleaded to him.
"It was asserted, that misunderstands the situation."
"Since nothing happened, that could have hurt it."
"This may not be something else, only a terrible misunderstanding."
"One single of their desire,that let everything be put onto his mood."
"Let us forget the whole one, kind Tót."
"- Maybe, that the mistake is in me."
I don't think he'd done it for some time.
I discovered something under the micrcope.
"Amonthe keratin proteins, I found translucent fibers of glass."
-Exactly.
-Fiberglass?

No worries.

7th Left.
Twenty three.

But I knew her address and that her father was a psychiatrist.
Dr.Roncero's office.
I'd like to make an appointment.
Does tomorrow at 5:00 suit you?
- Can't it be sooner?
"- No, tomorrow at 5:00."
All right.
Your name?
What's up?

- Come in.
Don't stand there!
Excuse me.
- Benigno Martin?
- Yes.
I have to get some details.
"I just wanted to see Alicia again, but as I was there and her father was a psychiatrist"
I decided to tell him I missed my mother.
"- The last fifteen years, you said?"
- Yes.
I started when I was very young.
And during those fifteen years you did nothing but look after your mother?
I never left her side.
"Well, I studied to be a nurse so I had to go out to attend classes."
"I also studied beauty therapy, make-up and hairdressing, but by mail."
You mean you did your mother's make-up and her hair?
"Of course, and I cut her hair, dyed it, did her nails and I scrubbed her down well, front and back."
"My mother wasn't disabled, or mad."
Ooh.
I can smell the judgment coming off of you.
"Well, they're people, and you're treating them like they're dolls."
"If we're gonna be partners, you really have to stop being such a hater."
We're in a partnership because we share a goal.
Don't ever confuse that for an acceptance of your lifestyle.
My lifestyle?
So I assume that you still don't have the invention.
I'll get it.
I said I would.
You threatened to expose Damon Salvatore.
That didn't work.
You killed that Pearl lady.
Still no invention.

"Well, you being here isn't going to help anything."

No.

"- No, I didn't ask."
- What about the invention?
- Didn't ask.
- She know about the tomb vampires?
- I don't know.
Did words completely escape you?
I was a little too distracted by my dead vampire wife to ask any questions.

"The minister,s coming, and nothing,s ready."
No one told us about it.
What do you mean?
You got a memo announcing his visit a month ago.
"There it is, on the wall."
- Right.
"The same one that says that in six months we,d get a raise and be promoted to level B-4 and never work over 40 hours a week."
"Where,s that replacement crew you promised?"
"We,re here 24 hours a day."
Listen.
"We,II discuss your demands later."
AII I can say is the minister arrives in five minutes.
Hmm?
Do you hate your job or what?
No.
The only job I ever hated was that horrible job as a bag boy at the supermarket.
I'm certainly glad I had the sense to get out of that after about a day.
"You've been listening, haven't you?"
Voices carry.
"Seriously, George, I mean, you've been a teacher all your life."
Do you still enjoy getting up in the morning?
"Oh, Alan..."
"It would be very easy for me to tell you that I have dedicated the last 38 years to several thousand young minds, and that is my chief joy and reason for getting up in the morning."
Except it isn't.
I teach because I like it.
And because it's fun for me.
"Ah, but when it stops being fun?"
"Well, then I suppose I would look to my family and friends for support to help me find something new."
"Well, thank you, George."
You've taught me something.
And it was fun for me.
"Oh, who am I kidding?"
"I mean, who would possibly stop and pick me up in the middle of rural Pennsylvania?"
Whoa!
"Young friend, how far art thou traveling?"
Me?
"Yes, thee."
"Uh, well, I'm going to Philadelphia."
"Well, I'm going as far as..."
That farmhouse there.
That farmhouse there?
Yes.
That farmhouse there.
I see.
"How about the effects at the house, Barney?"
They're in the works.
I also have the men.
"Jim, how does Gordon handle these so-called contracts for murder?"
Picks up the phone and the job gets done.
But he never does it himself.
Even if the job's here in town?
"No, he has an assistant, a man named Connie."
Always uses one of these delightful things.
The bodies are disposed of in the incinerator at Gordon's lumberyard.
Why don't we just keep an eye on Connie until he tries it again?
All we'd get is Connie.
We want Gordon.
"- How about the sweater, Barney?"
"- Right here, Jim."
- Heavy.
- It has eight layers of laminated nylon.
Backed by fine chain mail.
- The blood?
- It's in the ribbing.
"Rollin, were you able to work out the mask?"
Yes.
I have it right here.
Disintegrates two minutes after being exposed to the air.
And did Mr. Gordon accept the Harpers' invitation to dinner?
His R.S.V.P. Was in this morning's mail.
"Well, in that case..."
"Mrs. Harper, I think we'd better get headed for home."
"How are you, Burt?"
"Haven't lost your touch, huh?"
"What have you got, Lew?"
Anything I should know about any of these?
"- Yeah, you did."
On the inside.
What are you trying to say?
"Oh, that I love you, and that I want you to live forever."
Love you too.
"One more kiss, and make it a good one."

Here.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

"Drive safe, baby."
"We have been ordered to hand over Carlos Mejia to the FBI because somehow Mexico has found out we have him,"
- and now they want him back.
- So we're just gonna hand him over?
"Wait a minute, how the hell did they find out we have him?"
- I don't know yet.
"- Did anyone else know,"
- apart from us?
"- No, no."
They did not.
So we've been compromised.
Our security's been breached.
That's a possibility we have to consider.
"- Yes, absolutely."
- We can't let this happen.
"What do you suggest we do, pop a nine-mil in the back of Mejia's head while we still got him?"
"Oh, I know, how about we just send Mexico some more American jobs instead?"
What if the cartel are behind this?
- Pulling the strings...
- Of the Mexican Government?
- You don't think that's possible?
- Was I with anybody?
"- Uh, no."
Did I talk to anybody?
Did I tell you where I'd been or where I was going?
No.
"You, uh, just ate, and then you left."
"Uh, gave me your watch first."
Do you still have the watch?
Best wingman I ever had.
That does not look familiar.
And it's a knock-off.
But it's the freshest clue we have.
I'll buy it back from you.
Sure.
My brother was right.
Right about what?
The Phantom.
A serial killer Phillip was hunting.
He stumbled onto it working a missing-persons case.
We haven't heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.
That's why Phillip called him The Phantom...
Because no one has any idea that he exists.
"According to Phillip, The Phantom had been killing people in Los Angeles and New York for the last several years."
A bicoastal serial killer?
"Right before Phillip flew back to L.A., he told me that he'd had a break in the case, that he was close to identifying The Phantom."
He must have gotten too close to the truth.
I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom's alleged victims.
Total of seven...
"Four in L.A., three in New York."
All seven were killed with a knife.
Any pattern besides the knife?
No.
"Judy, Clarence saved your life."
"Don't you know Clarence, your old buddy?"
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, come in please."
Paula Tracy calling Daktari.
"Dad, can you hear me?"
"Yes, Paula, what is it?"
"Well, it's Judy, Dad, she was attacked by a leopard."
"- Well, was she hurt?"
"- Well, not really."
"Clarence chased the leopard away, but there's still something wrong with Judy."
"It's as if she's in shock, Dad."
I'm frightened.
She doesn't recognize me.
"Well, Paula, she's just probably playing games."
She doesn't even recognize Clarence.
"Dad, I think you better get back here and have a look at her."
"Paula, you know I can't do that."
We have to locate Sally.
Judy needs you more.
"Now, uh, Paula, I'm sure Judy will snap out of it."
"Right now, Sally holds the answers to a lot of information the space agency needs."
"Well, I don't care about Sally."
Judy's in terrible trouble and you're chasing some silly astro-chimp around the bush.
"Ah, now, listen, young lady, get a hold of yourself."
"You're not doing Judy, yourself or anyone any good by getting hysterical."
"Now listen, does--does Judy have any physical injuries?"
I'll check.
There's no visible wounds or broken bones.
"Well, does she have any muscle paralysis?"
"I'll tell you what, test her reflexes."
All right.
Take your time.
"Six stab wounds, all in her chest."
Any sign of a weapon?
Dishwasher was running when Chloe found her.
This knife was in it.
"So no chance of any prints on that, then?"
"All the buttons have been wiped clean, too."
Kelly tried to stop him.
Defensive wounds on both hands.
Looks like she put up a good fight.
Not good enough.
And you were just on a night out?
It was Teddy's birthday so drinks at Zu and then on to Belgos for food.
Only Kelly never showed?
She was finishing off some blood work.
Everyone was getting hungry so I called her about 8:30.
She said she was nipping home in a cab to get changed.
Got any idea which cab firm she used?
"Kwik Kall Kabs, we always use the same one."
"When the others left for Belgos,"
Joy and I went to... went to see what was keeping her.
Do you know if anyone wanted to hurt Kelly at all?
She have a boyfriend?
She was supposed to be getting married next month to Tom Hartson.
Kwik Kabs got the call around about 8:30 to pick up a Kelly from the lab and take her home.
Driver dropped her and went on to another pick-up.
You've checked that with the controller?
Yep.
And the next pick-up.
All checks out.
Maybe he remembers seeing someone hanging around outside the flat?
I dropped her off and watched her go in.
"I got it from another source, then I passed it on."
I should have made that clear in my original statement.
I'm extremely remorseful.
"Right, and who was the other source?"
An old friend from my days on armed robbery.
Terry Capistrano.
And do you have any further information?
"No, sir."
Only that I'm extremely remorseful.
"Well, thank you, DC Morton."
No further questions.
Interview terminated.
Wanker.
"Right, well, I'll check out this name he gave us."
"Oh, well, I wouldn't bother if I were you."
Terry Capistrano got Alzheimer's.
He was retired sick.
The poor bugger's lost his marbles.
Convenient.
"Oh, come off it, Kate."
Nigel's just trying to help.
Can we be sure?
"Look, I know he's a mate and everything, but he's a few months off retirement and, between me and you, his missus hasn't been too well lately."
"Well, I really don't give a shit."
"Look, his heart's in the right place."
"Let's just leave this cock-up behind us, eh?"
Please.
Yeah.
"Well, I suppose I can overlook it."
Thanks.
I really appreciate it.
"Now we know the Caddy's active again, this time we get the bastard."
Ellis wanted me to go back to Wales.
"And you what, you couldn't bear to miss the Blitz?"
I'm sorry.
"Well, at least Parfitt will be relieved."
"His wife, Mary, she's an invalid."
"He pays for a nurse in the day, but then he has to sit with her himself at night."
"When I told him you wanted more than Ministry wages, he was worried you'd found yourself in a similar position, what with your husband's Spanish War wound and all."
Should I...
Do you want me to come in tomorrow?
"And how would that help, losing you?"
Who the bloody hell else do you think's gonna be writing the slop?
"The work's good, Mrs. Cole."
You're doing a good job.
"Hello, Catrin."
- Hello.
- Hello.
Ellis?
I just saw Perry and Conroy.
You had friends over?
I got a letter.
"A commission to document bomb damage in the provinces, and an exhibition in London straight after."
- The National Gallery.
"Oh, Ellis."
"Will there be Sunday trains, do you think?"
Only I'll need to get back to London on Monday mornings.
- What are you talking about?
- Coming to see you.
"Well, you'll be with me, silly."
"Yes, of course."
After the script is finished.
"Well, you can get out of that now, surely."
But I don't want to get out of it.
"Nah, I'm just kiddin'."
She just likes me for my body.
You look great.
You do something different with your side view mirrors?
"What do you want, Sally?"
"Come on, make this guy fix the road."
The town needs this.
No.
I know his type.
Racecar.
That's the last thing this town needs.
"OK, I didn't want to have to do this, Doc, but you leave me no choice."
"Fellow citizens, you're all aware of our town's proud history."
Here she goes again.
"Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel strung on the necklace of Route 66, the mother road!"
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of the travelers
- on our stretch of that road.
- Travelers?
What travelers?
Ignore him.
"But how, I ask you, are we to care for those travelers if there is no road for them to drive on?"
"- Luigi, what do you have at your store?"
- Tires.
And if no one can get to you?
I won't sell any... tires.
I will lose everything!
"- Flo, what do you have at your store?"
- I have gas.
- Lotsa gas!
"- OK boys, stay with me."
"And, Flo, what'll happen if no one can come to your station to buy gas?"
I'll go outta business and...
I know the difference.
I hope you told the cops that.
Did you have any alcohol at all?
"Like two glasses of champagne, three tops."
And the boys were in the car?
Does it help that I was taking them to Disneyland?
It does not.
"So, what do we do about Diane?"
I have no idea.
You have no idea?
You're my lawyer.
"Yeah, well, I'm thinking of leaving the law..."
Starting a zoo.
Because I seem to have discovered the only animal in the known world that can actually fuck itself.
Wow.
"Please don't take this the wrong way, Matt, but you are the worst client I ever had, seriously."
I'd happily trade you for two Mel Gibsons and a Tiger Woods.
Jesus!
"As far as the D.U.I., this is your first offense, amazingly, so we can probably get you off with a little community service."
"As far as Diane, you're on your own."
Jesus!
Yep.
The new guy's changing everything.
Time to get out the old résumés.
"Well, I think that's premature."
I don't have a résumé.
How do you not have a résumé?
This is the only place I've ever worked.
"Well, except for the summer after college."
I was one of the snow whites at Disneyland.
I never knew that.
I worked the Graveyard Shift.
"Dude, don't give into temptation..."
"I love your use of slow-mo, Pete."
"Good job there, Mike."
"That's not slo-mo, that Alexis' performance."
"Oh, God."
You think it's easy to achieve that?
- Damn.
- Slo-mo acting.
Damn lady.
I just wanna say I feel like we set a ridiculous pace for this commentary and now we're all finding it hard to keep up.
We realized this is gonna go on for two hours.
It's a good thing that we have Pete's list of questions.
My coffee is starting to wear off.
"Oh, my God."
- This was shot in the studio...
- Stage.
This was the very last thing we shot.
"Actually, the very last thing we shot on the movie during principal photography was the moment..."
Was your orgasm.
- The overhead shot on the couch.
"- Oh, that."
"But that morning, on day 29 of shooting, we shot this."
I remember sitting there watching this because it was beautiful.
- So this wasn't a reshoot.
- Were you wrestling?
"- No, this is principal photography."
- Right.
- Were you really tickling each other?
"- Yeah, that was real tickling."
"I love this song, by the way."
- This song by The Submarines.
- The Submarines.
"I was really eating this, because I use..."
I remember I said that I thought when girls ate in movies it looked fake and like they weren't swallowing.
Like they were just gonna throw...
"Like, barf it into a thing after."
Because usually they give you a bucket to spit stuff out.
I hate when I see it in movies where they're not eating and not swallowing.
- It does get disgusting.
"- Yeah, it was gross."
And I regretted it.
I skipped lunch that day and went and...
I did a scene once where I ate a fig per take.
"And we did it like all day and I was like, ""Why did I do this?"""
Because you can't get out of it once you've started.
And drinking stuff too.
It's hard too.
"Like, if you have a lot of beverage."
Don't get me started about drinking things.
God.
This is a real phone.
"- Oh, boy."
- And in the background...
"There were people in the background, like Rachel Cohn, who wrote the book."
And David Levithan.
"Yeah, where are you?"
Did you leave the city?
- I'm at Veselka.
- What are the cross streets?
Second and Ninth.
"Okay, well, don't leave."
"I'm gonna come over, okay?"
"In the meantime, could you pass that message on?"
I'm happy about something.
He didn't say anything interesting at all.
- Huh.
"- So, after 30 years, my dad finally had a chance to sit across from the man who was running everything."
And you know what he saw?
What?
Nothing.
Nothing special.
My dad realized in that moment he could have been that guy sitting behind that desk.
But he realized it too late.
"We're all just a bunch of guys, Joe."
Some of us believe that we could do anything.
And some of us believe we can't.
"So, when you ask me why I wanna do this, my answer is because I know what guy I wanna be."
What about you?
"( clears throat ) I definitely don't wanna be the guy that just lets the clock run out, you know."
I definitely do not wanna be the guy who just sits there while time fucking stands still.
I wanna be the guy.
- The fucking guy?
- Yeah!
"Yeah, the fucking guy."
Then let's get the fuck out of here.
( chuckles ) Holy shit.
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

It's the parenting.
That's what the hell it is.
"Now, parenting, now I'm not gonna get cliché like every other Black comedian, get on this stage and say you should whup your kids."
"'Cause honestly, I got whipped, and I'm halfway retarded, okay?"
But what you should--
And whupping your kids is not really a good thing to do right now.
Look at Adrian Peterson.
Now what did he really do?
"Okay, he hit his son with a switch."
That's it?
'Cause my mom hit me with... anything she could find.
One time she fucked me up with a Ninja Turtles umbrella.
I couldn't even watch the series anymore.
"Every time the theme music came on,"
I just started having a breakdown and shit.
It'd be...
¶ Teenage Mutant--
"I'd be, ""Ahhh!"""
"And you know, I was a little mischievous when I was a little kid."
"Okay, you know, my pop got me too."
"You know, he in here."
He got me.
"He got me, man."
This one time he beat me in front of the church with drumsticks.
And he was the drummer.
It wasn't even a whipping for him.
It was practice.
"As soon as he was done, he just got back on the stand and just kept doing the same shit just like this here."
"I said, ""You learned that here first."""
"""I'm gonna need some royalties for that shit, you know what I'm saying?"""
It's all good.
"I love my pop, man."
Go ahead!
Go ahead and kill me!
Release my friend and kill me instead!
Stop!
Magistrate!
Magistrate!
What's this commotion?
There's trouble!
What's going on?
Release the innocent man!
Release Yi Soon-shin!
Release him!
Release the innocent man!
"Release Yi Soon-shin and take me instead, you evil bastards!"
"Sir, I have a bad feeling about this."
They might break the gates down and storm inside!
What?
Break down the gates of the government center?
I would advise you to release the prisoner for now.
What?
You want me to give in to those lowly peasants?
"Sir, are you aware about the civil unrest of Pyung-tek two years ago?"
Civil unrest?
The government agency was looted and several officials were stoned to death!
Release Yi Soon-shin!
Release the innocent man!
Soon-shin!
"Soon-shin, are you all right?"
Did they hurt you?
I'm sorry...
I'm your friend and I let them do this on account of me...
Father...!
Stop!
"Don't stop us, Admiral!"
If we are criminals of treason what does that make our men?
We are not treasonous rebels!
Kill them!
Kill them!
"What are you waiting for, Admiral?"
Arrest these men now!
"Admiral, what do we have to lose at this point?"
Let us slay these men and change this world!
What?
Or I will slay these men and take my own life!
Admiral!
Very well.
I will slay these men and march to the capital!
Admiral!
Put down your swords!
"Are you intent on becoming a traitor, Admiral?"
A traitor?
Did you say a traitor?
The Japanese killed your father and took your mother.
Is that correct?
Admiral...
Your sister hung herself after being raped by an enemy soldier.
Isn't that right?
"Yes, Admiral!"
Chun Woo-song!
This man's infant son starved to death next to his mother.
Do you know why?
Because the Japanese killed his mother by cutting off her breasts!
Now do you understand?
This is why we can't stop fighting.

"Yeah, me too."
So is this considered our third date?
Because I brought my batting glove.
Your mother looks like she's having a good time.
"No, she's just had so many face lifts, her mouth is stuck that way."
The kids call her the Joker.
I think it upsets her.
How can you tell?
"Oh, hey, look-- it's Christine."
Who's she with?
Is that her dad?
It must be.
"Wow, he's so handsome and well-dressed."
"Oh, she must take after her mother."
"Oh, God, that's good."
"You know, sometimes, I wish I was the funny one and you were the pretty one."
I think those two women are staring at us.
"Ugh, ignore them."

Should I step away?
Are you embarrassed to be seen with me?
"Because if you'd rather be with one of the other grandfathers,"

"- Yes, sir."
"This is ridiculous, sir."
They're all behaving as if this was some sort of bloody fairground attraction.
Have you any idea how many people were here yesterday?
"12,000. 12,000!"
"I mean, where in God's name are they all coming from?"
It's making work quite impossible and it's only a matter of time before there's an accident.
"I think it's something we have to put up with, old man."
The amount of interest this thing has generated is quite extraordinary.
I've been giving interviews all morning.
"We're front page news, Howard."
Hmm.
"Well, no one's spoken to me."
"If they had, I'd have told them to bugger off."
Did I tell you His Majesty has asked me to Buck House for lunch to tell him all about it?
"What's this, do you suppose?"
It's a shabti figure.
Thank you.
"Howard, Homicide."
"Hey, Beth."
Lunch tomorrow?
"Sure, what time?"
Fire inspector?
"She knows the bar, says it won't be a problem but she can't get here till next week."
Building inspector?
A slight snag.
He's sick.
He's scheduled to do the tour 8:00am Thursday if his rabies clears up.
Health inspector?
I'm meeting him tomorrow at 10:00am.
He's nice.
I dated his sister once.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
All of these bureaucrats have to sign off before we can buy the bar?
That's how it works.
Why can't they just have one guy come down and check out everything?
I'm no expert but I'm starting to believe in less government.
"There's too much regulation, there's too many shackles and business should be free of these kinds of restraints."
"Anyway, what do I know?"
I'm just a silent partner.
Does he seem silent to you?
- Coffee?
"- Yeah, thanks."
"Sometimes after these marathon shifts, I get these coffee headaches, and the only way to get rid of them is to drink more coffee."
How about I buy?
Buy?
"It's the squad's coffee, it's free."
"I'd still like to buy, huh?"
"Okay, gang, take off the mustaches."
"Now, what is it, Schulz?"
"Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva man is coming to inspect the camp and find out whether we are living up to the international convention."
I'm sure he will find that we are treating you very well.
"Now, you must not run around in your underwear."
And take off the wash.
The kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
"Ja, we'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs."
The kommandant also sends you clean blankets.
He wants every man to have a new clean blanket.
"Yeah, yeah, we know."
We had them last year.
"Five minutes after the Geneva man was gone, the blankets were gone."
"Uh, the kommandant also told me to pick up the radio."
Radio?
"What radio, Schulz?"
"The one you are hiding in the barracks, don't you know?"
The one your friend mit out the leg is smuggling all over the compound.
"Schulz, you're off your nut."
- Give me the radio.
-No radio.
"All right, gentlemen, I will find it myself."
"Now, let's see."
Where could it be?
Maybe...
Maybe in the lieutenant's bunk?
"Oh, no, not in the lieutenant's bunk."
I'm cold here.
Maybe warmer on this side.
In the piccolo may--
"Oh, no, not in the piccolo."
Am I getting warmer?

"Lieutenant, I've been trying to figure out how much time Zucco had to plant this bomb."
Do you know what time he got here?
He got here about 8:00.
What time did he leave the store?
He was still there at 5:30 before Mr. Morgan left.
"That only gives him about, uh, two and a half hours."
That means this nut could've planted it anyplace...
"NewJersey, Riverdale, Staten Island!"
All right.
Here.
This is a list of addresses of these patients here.
I want you to call Explosives.
"Check out all their houses, okay?"
"Who knows, maybe one of these people got under Zucco's skin."
"Hey, it's possible, you know."
We're not dealing with what you call a rational person.
"There really is no need to check us out, Lieutenant."
He couldn't do it.
He loved us.
"We're a family, right?"
"Now, look."
I don't want to disturb your group.
"But maybe tonight, somebody's gonna get blown up who's got a nice family going for him."
"Now, did this Zucco complain about anybody or you complain to him, where he might have set off with another bomb?"
"Well, the only thing I talked to him about lately was baseball."
"I got him interested in the Mets, became their fan."
Strange.
He was never a fan before.
"How about you, Mrs. Holder?"
Anything mentioned about that divorce?
And why so?
"You see, Miss Sheetal, there are many reasons for this."
"It so happened that... ltjust crossed my mind that, I thought you'd understand what I understood."
But you couldn't understand it either.
And you thought I understood what you were tying to make me understand.
This misunderstanding has created a bit of confusion.
"And ifyou see through, we are stuck in a strange whirlwind."
Whirlwind!
What whirlwind?
I don't get what you say.
Exactly.
This is the confusion.
And to get out of it we must meet rightaway.
"And ifwe put our heads together, Miss Sheetal we can easily get out ofthis confusion... gradually."
ARer that evemhing will be all right.
And then...
it will be all bed of roses!
But this outcome won't come byjust sitting at home.
"We must meet, and keep meeting."
But I don't want to meet you.
Since when have you started lying?
"An_ay, dump these odd talks."
They are unyielding.
I am free tomorrow.
Why don't we make it tomorrow then?
That's final. I'll see you at Golden Chariot tomorrow.
I don't want to meet you.
-See you at 4 in the evening.
Keep waiting.
I won't come.
No way.
I had said I wasn't coming.
- No.
- Why not?
That's really none of your business.
(Tractor horn plays Dixie)
"Just pull over here, Mr Anderson, and let's talk a little business."
What about instalments?
I could maybe find a deposit.
"No, these things are selling like hot cakes."
I don't really do credit.
"Look, you're a lawyer, right, like Mr Kingdom?"
"That's right, yes."
"My son David and his girlfriend are looking to buy their own place, and I was thinking I might like to help them, by lending them the money."
Very generous spirited of you.
"So, look, why don't you do me a nice quick loan agreement, watertight, and I will let you buy a Whizz."
"An agreement that David can't get out of, that ties him down."
"If you want the car, I'm the only one round here who can help you."
"So, you'll be wanting to say yes."
It's a deal!

Lets.
The End

"NARRATOR""."
When last we saw the Caped Crusaders they were trapped in Black Widow's giant cobweb about to be bitten by two deadly Black Widow spiders.
Are the heroes headed for that great Batcave in the sky?
"In scant seconds, the answer will be yours."
"Batman, he's almost on me."
"He is a she, Robin."
Only the female of the species is venomous.
And mine is almost upon me also.
I've freed my right hand.
Now if I can just reach the mini charge in my utility belt.
I've got it.
"Brace yourself for a shock of 5000 volts, Robin."
We'll be stunned for a split second.
"But the cobweb will act as a conductor, and the spiders will be electrocuted."
"- Hurry, Batman."
She's ready to bite me.
-Now.
"Good going, Batman."
I thought we were dead ducks.
I'm sure Black Widow thinks we're dead bats about now.
What was that exit line of hers?
Tse-tse fly can kill you.
What?
Just drinking coffee.
To what do I owe this honor?
- Is this a bad time?
"- No, I just really need to sit down."
Much better...
Do you see a clean towel over there?
- Honestly...
Not really.
- Never mind.
What's up?
I wanna say thank you for what you did for us at the...
- carnival.
- I go where I'm needed.
That's what makes me superhero.
I know I haven't really been that super to you in the past.
"Are you in some kind of 12-step program, or something?"
"Unless they started a one for idiots, who, stripted their lavaliere and are having a hard time getting over it."
I can give you some pointers there.
Not that I've had ex boyfriends.
"What I wanna say, Cap', is that I'm hoping you and I can... start over."
Be friends.
"We've definitely tried the other thing, right?"
"With a lot of fun, but not much success."
"Friend Cappie, at your service."
Thank you.
What don't you tell me what you really came here for?
- Why do you assume...
"- Cause even though we're startin' over, we're not really."
I know you.
Fair enough.
Then it shall be welcome in our house.
"Oh, well, no, you don't have to keep it here just because of me."
"I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah."
You're the best digger in Egypt.
My services are entirely inconsequential to them.
They've hired or shanghaied every digger in Cairo.
The excavation is enormous.
They hire only strong backs and they pay pennies for them.
It's as if the pharaohs had returned.
When did they find the map room?
Three days ago.
They have not one brain among them.
Except one.
He is very clever.
He's a French archaeologist.
What's his name?
"They call him ""Bellosh."""
Belloq.
Belloq.
The Germans have a great advantage over us.
They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.
"Well, they're not going to find it without this."
Who can tell us about these markings?
Perhaps a man I know can help us.
Indy... there is something that troubles me.
What is it?
The Ark.
"If it is there, at Tanis, then it is something that man was not meant to disturb."
Death has always surrounded it.
It is not of this earth.
"Do we need the monkey, huh?"
"I'm surprised at you, Jones- talking that way about our baby."
Gotta be freeway scavengers.
Headed south on the Golden State.
Attention all units.
The contaminated baby food dropped from the truck this morning was possibly picked up and carried off in a converted school bus.
The bus is described as pre-1960 still official yellow color.
The lettering has been painted over.
"When last seen, a canvas tarpaulin tied to its roof."
"Well, they could be anywhere."
It's late.
They gotta stop to camp for the night.
There aren't many places a vehicle like that can stop.
They usually can't afford the regular trailer camps.
"You know, they stop up in the Santa Monica canyons a lot."
Yeah.
They use the open areas alongside the road to camp.
"Okay, right."
You two take Topanga Canyon.
I'll send other units to help.
"Barkley, take Malibu Canyon, all right?"
Hold it.
There's an accident this side of the tunnel.
Took an hour to get a tow truck up.
Another one's hung up there.
It's a big mess.
Motor's the only way through.
"Okay, you go."
"And you two better go too, since you know what it looks like."
"- Make sure you hit the side roads, right?"
- Okay.
There's a rest area up ahead.
I'll take it.
I'll ask over here.
The only way to get past it is to erase Aaron.
"What do you mean,"
"""We're going to erase Aaron?"""
"When they put me through Everclear, they'll find out about everyone."
"Roger, Elena, you."
I need to map out my brain and lock all those memories away.
Away?
Away where?
Here.
This is an imprint of my current neural map.
"Once I pass Everclear,"
I need you to connect this to the base of my skull to bring me back.
You'll only have a few days to do it or Aaron will be gone for good.
If that thing doesn't lobotomize you completely first.
I'm just temporarily disconnecting some circuits.
Aaron isn't a circuit.
It's who you are.
But he's not who I need to be right now.
This is gonna sting.
[device beeping]
Strap me in.
[soft dramatic music]
So now what?
"Just, uh, flip a switch and say, ""Bye, bye, Aaron."""
Either that or this thing turns me into a vegetable.
Relax.
It knows exactly which memories to sever.
Then my brain will fill the gaps with the cover story I'm using.
The lie becomes the truth.
At least that's the idea.

"""Is it OK by you?"""
Oh!
"I know, it should have ended on a big laugh."
"But listen, we have a responsibility on As Yet Untitled to think of the title for the show."
"Every time I look at you now, I imagine you having sex in the woods."
Yeah!
I would say we go one better than that and we just say Queefing In The Woods.
Queefing In The Woods is an option.
Can you remember any of our conversation?
Bits and bobs.
I like...
What was your line for the judge?
"Where you go, ""Do you want to speak to the judge or do you want this?"""

"No, it's this thing with Alan Davies..."
"No, not QI."
He's doing something on his own for Dave.
I know he's got some massive tax bill.
This gets me out the house.
I only hope Alan's changed his hairstyle.
"Driving a yellow convertible with the top down, dressed like assholes!"
Yo.
Yo.
"Yo, look, he has one of these things."
- Would you put that down?
"- No, you can hook up to the Internet."
You can play Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!

King Hippo's going down.
Put that away.
Put that away.
"I can't believe you can even think about playing games at a time like this, man."
You realize what would happen if our parents found out about this?
You have sent our sons to Guantánamo Bay?
This is an outrage!
"You Arabs think you can just mix in with our peaceful society... and we're not gonna find you, huh?"
I am not Arab!
I am Indian!
"Look, Chief."
"I'm not here to argue seblantics with you, OK?"
I'm here to save lives.
Ask the Lees what they know about their son's terrorist activity.
"Look, we have been American citizens for over 40 years."
"Now, frankly, I find this very offensive."
They're using some sort of dialect I've never heard before.
But I'm pretty sure he said something about going on the offensive.
"Tell them we know what their son is up to... and if they don't cooperate, he could be sentenced to death."
Hit 'em.
Yeah.
We know what he said!
"Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys."
He's supposed to be in medical school.
You're home.
Did you see that there was an attempted robbery at the new mall?
I'm glad I cancelled jack's photos.
I just decided I wanted you to be there.
It's better if we do it as a family.
Is everything ok?
"Yeah,everything's perfect."
"Ralph waldo emerson once said in order to learn the most important lessons of life, one must each day surmount a fear."
When did you know you were gonna have to trick him?
The first time I talked to him.
You realized you couldn't break him?
"Well,I realized he was too smart to have had that nextel phone registered to him accidentally."
He drew us there.
He wanted our presence at gitmo to confirm that he was successful.
And that's when you started moving up the time of his prayers.
"If I'd used an actual clock, he might have caught on."
So it was all a chess game.
We won this round... but you heard him.

"Oh, and this is for dinner in case your dad makes that chicken thing with the cherries."
- Hello.
"When I was inside, nothing happened."
When I was out it was all there to read on the front page.
"Yes, I read all the papers."
- You certainly make a good-looking priest.
- Thanks.
"Your mother always wanted you to do it, but what finally decided you?"
"Well, I was riding along on the top of a bus looking down, passing the cathedral."
"- That gave you the idea, huh?"
"That's funny, I got an idea on the top of a bus once."
Got me six years.
I was around while you were singing with the kids and I kept thinking of you and me 20 years ago.
- With Father Boyle.
- Yeah.
"Remember slipping ""Merry Oldsmobile"" into the hymnbook?"
- How could I forget it?
- How'd it go?
"Lead, kindly light Amid the encircling gloom"
"Lead thou me on, for the night is dark And I am far from..."
- Did a lot of crazy things in those days.
- Certainly did.
Certainly did.
Come in.
"Father, you're supposed to be down at the store."
The fellas are waiting for you.
You run and tell them I'll be right over.
Tell them to get the game started.
"- Okay, Father!"

What's this store racket?
Got the kids shilling for the parish?
"That's not a bad idea, Rocky."
No.

"Sylvia, he alone is poised to win this year's derby."
"I'm sory Mr Daaga, Prakash couldn't deliver your gold to the right man."
Prakash?
Who Prakash?
I found your telephone number and address on him.
Are you talking about the Prakash who fell to death from a train?
"Yes, I remember. I read about him in the newspapers."
I am delighted to hear that you read newspapers.
But why did he keep my telephone number and address?
He could have told you.
Your misfortune.
He is dead.
The news of his death was a false news spread by us to cheat you.
He isn't dead.
He's alive and kicking.
He is alive?
And he has testified in the hospital itself.
"Don't you fret, Mr Daaga."
Prakash is dead.
I just wanted to see the change in colour ofyour face.
"These things are trivial, Inspector."
The court asks for evidence.
And as long as the police doesn't find any evidence against us it can't even shake us.
Little mouths don't open in front of elders.
Understand?
"Inspector Vijay, you have insulted my man."
I can sue you for this in Court.
"Well, Mr Daaga, you will have to produce evidence for this smack."
How can I help you in this matter?
Vijay is a close friend ofyours.
He is.
"Pardon me, dear Father, I beseech you."
"Henceforward, I will live beneath your rule."

What nonsense!

"Why, 'tis compliment enough to give me cheer."
Hmm?
Hmm?
Wife!
Nurse!

Crixus again shows form.

Both men you have often praised.
Perhaps you have learned something after all these years.
Perhaps.
You have lost sense.

They will brand me fugitivus!
They will not find you.
It's damn filthy here!
The furniture and the mattresses are all covered in dust.
You beat those out before it starts snowing again...
"Can I do anything else for you, dear Anna?"
"Yes, make it so clean here that one can eat from the floor!"
- Before Karl returns home again...
- When does he come then?
"Then he'll ask me again what you have done in the meantime, and I can lie again..."
"Oh, Mrs John."

- Is Mr Hassenreuter there?
"- No, how come?"
Mrs John!
Good evening.
Mrs Knobbe!
"I'm so grateful to you, Mrs John."
That you can look after the little one for a few hours at least.
- It has to stay somewhere.
- Its neverending coughing and crying never lets me sleep.
I have to be on duty at night...
Won't you take a seat?
And all that after the difficult birth!
It's a blessing that it's so dark in the bar.
"Tell me, Mrs Knobbe, for how long have you been staying in bed?"
"For six days, Mrs John!"
Six days and then it's:
"""Out, we need the bed!"""
"Having children is no illness, says the health service."
Not the slightest consideration.
"When it comes to paying, they squeeze everyone."
But he won't let himself be squeezed...

Didn't you say he was as funny as a dick pimple?
Randy open mic'd for three years before he got down here.

Yeah.
"Whatever, nigga."
You don't ever get to call me that.
"And if you roll your motherfucking eyes at me again, your head is gon' be rolling after it."
You understand that?

"Clap for me, please."
Mind the fucking light.

I know what you're thinking.
I look like Danny Partridge if his mom kicked him out of the band.
"Wonder if there were some family members that didn't pass the audition, you know?"
"Like, behind the long bus there's a little short bus."
"Poor kid, Patrick Partridge, sitting back there wondering,"
"""Why can't I shake the tambourine or hit the triangle or something?"""
I hear you're having dinner with Roy Brenner.
Yeah.
Somebody was harping in his ear.
Eh.
[laughs]
Thought I'd use the guy's pain.
Little inside information on Brenner.
He doesn't like hard to get.
So do me a favor and quit acting like you're doing him a favor.
You want this.
"You want it more than anyone, so woo him."
My name is Brent Sodor.
I used to be on Schmidt's security team.
You work for Schmidt?
!
Do I look like I'm still on the payroll?
!
I was being tortured!
Please.
"Y-you're trying to find him, right?"
Right?
Am I right?
"Well, I can help you."
I'll tell you anything you want.
Just don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.
Untie him.
We're taking him to Jabbar.
He lives for now.
"Most intelligence agencies lack the resources to set up safe houses all over the world, which is why they depend on expat civilians to lend their homes or businesses for missions abroad."

I have an idea.
You're the guy that's...
trying to kill Schmidt.
Yeah.
My name is Jabbar Hamady.
Mr. Schmidt has taken something that belongs to me.
"So, my men told me a very interesting story about finding you in the warehouse."
Tell me about this.
"Yeah, my name's Brent Sodor, and, like I told your men, I'm on Schmidt's security team."
You have a lieutenant here.
"Lieutenant, uh, James Dunbar."
"Yes, sir."
I'm Lieutenant Dunbar.
What is your number?
105353.
That is correct.
"Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations."
"Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men."
I'll live.
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt.
They are very angry in Berlin.
They will be even angrier on the east front waiting for that ammunition train.
"Don't you think so, lieutenant?"
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Now, lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters?"
I have a nice fire going.
I'm okay here.
Why bother?
No bother.
I'm very grateful for a little company.
"You see, I suffer from insomnia."
Did you ever try 40 sleeping pills?
"We have some rights, colonel."
Why is this man being taken out?
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.
You will not get them.
How did he ever find out about that train?
You must have shot your mouths off from Frankfurt to here.
"- No, we didn't."
-Maybe just a hint or so?
Think hard.
You must've really won her over.
She does not dig up those stories for just anyone.
You can get even tonight.
My parents will be happy to fill you in on all the gory details of my adolescence.

There's no need to rush.
"There'll be plenty of war left, I can promise you."
But I want to fight now.
Everyone's in uniform except me.
I know I never told you often enough.
You were the best goddamn center fielder in high school.
"And on ice, heh heh, tough as nails."
Not to mention the way you fight fire.
You put every other fireman I ever knew to absolute goddamn shame.
I should have said this shit when I was alive.
"But hell, I'm saying it now."
You are the best goddamn son a father could ever hope for.
You happy now?
- Yeah.
"- Well, get over it."
"Because if you believe all that, I got some land down in florida I might want to sell you."
Now give me a goddamn drink.

Were there blows?
- Almost.

And you no longer have the right to drop by for any of your little visits here.
"I happen to be Mrs. Adam Carrington, and I will come and go as I please."
"Don't try and give yourself Carrington airs, lady."
A wedding band on your finger doesn't mean anything around here.
You're still a nobody.
"Oh, that is wonderful coming from you."
Who came from nowhere and married Steven for his money.
And then was willing to sell her own son.
At least I loved him.
"You're wrong, Claudia."
I'm the winner here.
And I always have been.
I'm a rich woman with my own power.
And I don't have to live off other people's handouts.
Poor Claudia.
That's all you've ever been around here.
"In case you didn't know it then, you know now."
The painting on the staircase was just the beginning.
I hear the paintings in the west gallery alone are worth millions.
"Modiglianis, Riveras, Monets, Manets."
"Princess, don't you see?"
We're sitting on a gold mine.
It's more like a mine field.
We've got to be patient.
There's a whole lot more for us than Sammy Jo's inheritance.
Patient.
Are you crazy?
I can't keep coming up with headaches.
What am I supposed to do?
Sleep with him.
Yeah.
Clearly one of them was used to commit all seven murders.
There were eight.
W-What are you talking about?
I discovered a fourth New York victim...
A man by the name of Pat Crews.
Are you sure?
Phillip Harris only knew about three.
There's a reason he missed this one.
Because this murder took place on the same day The Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.
But how can that be?
Unless...
"There are two serial killers, one on each coast."
[Knock on door]
- [Groans] Who is that?
- Castle:
I don't know.
"Whoever it is, I hope they brought coffee."
Detective Menendez.
- You know...
- Please come in.
"I expect to be screwed over by an asshat that I don't know, but not from one who's supposed to be my friend."
I take it that you heard about what happened at Austin Elektra's house last night.
You said you'd keep me in the loop.
"Look, we can explain."
"Uh, Austin had a prop knife that matched the murder weapon."
And our lab tested it this morning...
it's clean.
Did you manage to track down the other four knives used in the movie?
Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse.
"They came up clean, too."
And according to the prop master...
It won't happen again.
- Thank you.
- Did I fail?
- No.
- I-I'm sorry.
Um...
Did I fail?
You won't tell them...
- Most patients come to Rosewood in order to relax and recuperate away from the harsh... day-to-day life outside of these gates.
"Some patients, however, they're faced with more..."
advanced challenges.
"But not to worry, patients like that are kept in a separate wing from ladies such as yourself, Miss Porter."
Shall we?
- Of course.
"- And if you decide you don't like it,"
I'll come right back.
- Okay.
- Okay?
That girl looked really disturbed.
Are you sure you want to stay?
"- Roderick, do quit your ceaseless worrying."
This is just what I need.
I feel better already.
- I'll come visit you soon.
Take care.
- Perhaps you'd like some tea?
"- Oh, that sounds wonderful."
"- Now you just let Gunther know when you're ready, and he'll show you to your quarters."
It can be easy to get lost here until you know your way around.
- Thank you.
- She seems rather a bore.
Is she anyone of note?
"I guess I always thought it was about human limitation, both mental and physical."
"Okay, that..."
that just blew my face off.
"Well, I hope that helps."
It does.
"Thank you so much, Miss Murray."
This has been terrific.
"Hey, uh, before we go, do you mind if I use your restroom?"
It was a long drive up here.
"No, go right ahead."
We should do something without him sometime.
Do you like tapas?
Someone invited me out for that once.
"I thought they said topless, so I was like,"
(high-pitch): what?
That's a good story.
"Hey, you know, that was really cool how you told us what ""Snowbird"" was about."
"Well, you know, that's just the way"
I always interpreted the song.
But I suppose Gene probably could have explained it better than I.
Who's Gene?
Gene MacLellan.
He wrote the song.
I see.
"But you wrote all your other songs, right?"
"No, all of my songs were written by other people."
"As a singer, I've been blessed to interpret the works of many gifted, sensitive songwriters."
Oh.
"So, you're just a big (bleep) liar?"
Sit back down.
"All right, come on, Stewie, let's go home... (muffled grunts)"
"Stewie, what the hell are you doing?"
But I felt like it was the right thing to do.
"Look, I know you and my father used to hate each other,"
But that was a long time ago.
You are the only one
Still having this fight.
He has moved on.
Is everything okay?
Rufus went to the board and blocked dad
From getting the apartment.
"Serena, that's absurd."
Rufus would never do something like that.
"I would, to protect my marriage."
"I don't trust William's intention,"
And I don't want him living under my roof.
"Rufus, you're being completely paranoid."
"At first he tried he tried to isolate you from your family,"
And now he's moving into the building
To get closer to you.
"I told you, he's moving in to be close to the children."
All I see here is jealousy run amok.
"Mom, come on."
We should go.
"Lil Rufus, it's probably best if you don't come tonight."
What are you two doing here?
This is an alumni event.
Columbia puts aside a bunch of tickets for students.
"We'd invite you to join, but they were very explicit-"
No fake students allowed.
"Hey, doctor."
"If you'll excuse me a moment,"
I should go say hello to a few old colleagues.
I'll be right back.
"No, I've been waiting here to apologise."
"Well, well."
"Not to you, not now, but, well, to the United States."
We accept your apology.
Look.
I came here with good intentions and at another time
"I might admit you had provocation the other night, but for a grown man to..."
"Well, it's positively disgraceful and I ruined my best pair of nylons."
"Have you any idea what nylons cost these days, if you can get them?"
"Whatever it was, it was worth it."
"So help me, next time I have a bottle I'll launch that guy."
Hold it!
"Keep trying, Plotski."
Poletski.
"What's the matter, Cookie?"
I got my walking papers.
They're sending me back to my old unit.
You'll be the best cook in the British Army.
Not me.
I've applied for a transfer to the Commandos.
"Hey, you've got something there."
"Not a hope, McKendrick."
I couldn't possibly agree to a transfer.
Look.
Do you realise what it costs to train just one parachutist?
"Over £5,000."
"If I transfer you, what have we got for our money?"
Absolutely nothing.
"There are two ways a man can get out of here, by refusing to jump or feet first."
"Is that final, Sir?"
"Of course, you could refuse to jump."
"All right, you can fall out."
"Well, can you blame me?"
No worries.
I am more than happy with the way things worked out.
"Hey, guys."
Enjoy the party.
"Oh, my favorite married couple."
- Rosalie.
- Come on.
I'll show you around.
Why not?
Think of this party like a 1950s housewife...
Proper and reserved on the outside... naughty behind closed doors.
Each room has a different office-related theme for play.
We call this the afternoon delight room.
Everything in here is about your middle of the workday fantasy.
That's one way to get ahead.
Give that man a raise.
Adriana would like to speak to you for a moment.
In your office.
Don't be long.
"I paid for your ass tonight, and I expect to have it to myself."
"Yes, ma'am."
This is a great location for a party.
Promise you'll let me come back.
"If this small talk is just a ploy to seduce me,"
I'm not interested.
I just got a call from Agent Garcia about your case.
Good news: the investigation will be closed on Monday...
Thank God.
When they arrest Victor on fraud and money laundering charges.
They found out?
"They already knew, Neil."
I'm kind of nervous.
"Ryan, could you quit fretting over your nerd gear for like five seconds?"
"We have a real crisis on our hands, unless Summer's wrong, and I'm not completely insufferable."
"- Why didn't you just tell me, then?"
- It was kind of hard getting a word in.
"I mean, you're a good talker, but you're not so"
Summer's right then.
"I have to do, I have to change."
I have to be a better person.
Better how?
"Uh, less selfish."
"More selfless, less take, more give."
"- Less pitching, more catching."
"- Look, man, I'm used to it."
You don't have to change for me.
"- Oh, I'm not changing for you."
"- For who then, Summer?"
"Uh, no, no, uh, uh, I"
- I think for the greater good of man.
"There's no hidden agenda here, like say, getting Summer back?"
"Dude, I don't even want Summer back."
"Unless... that is what she wants, in which case, that's not about me."
"That's about... me supporting her, and her wanting of, of, of me..."
"But I think that's what she wants, okay?"
Just admit it... you want her back.
No.
"No, I don't."
"- It's the new me, Ryan."
"World, wrap your head around the new Seth Cohen."
- You're talking about yourself in the third person
How is Seth's hair right now?
"- Oh, you can thank me later."
-You look lovely.
"-l look good, huh?"
You look wonderful.
Be careful.
Congratulations.
I love you.
"Don't paint any more religious pictures, please."
God be with you.
We always called each other goodfellas.
You'd say to somebody:
"""You'll like this guy."
He's all right.
"He's a goodfella, he's one of us. """
You understand?
We were goodfellas.
Wiseguys.
But Jimmy and I could never be made because we had Irish blood.
It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian.
To become a member of a crew you've got to be 100 percent Italian so they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
"See, it's the highest honor they can give you."
It means you belong to a family and a crew.
It means nobody can fuck around with you.
"It also means you can fuck around with anybody, just as long as they aren't also a member."
It's like a license to steal.
It's a license to do anything.
"Hey, how many years ago was it you was made?"
"Ah, I'm an old-timer."
Thirty years ago.
"30 years, huh?"
Brings back a lot of memories.
"Pike's Peak was a fuckin' pimple then, wasn't it?"
"As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made it was like we were all being made."
That's a complete lie.
I can't believe that you are willing to destroy
My relationship with my father because you're too scared
That yours won't love you for who you really are.
You were right.
We need to make these decisions together.
"But the truth is, consulting with someone else"
Doesn't come easily to me.
I get it.
"Vanessa, I totally support you going."
"Thank you, but I'm not taking the internship."
I'd rather lose the job than lose you.
You're not gonna lose me if you go to Haiti.
We're-we're-we're gonna find a way to make this work.
All right?
But you gotta go.
"I don't want to, and we both know"
It's better for our relationship if I stayed.
"I mean, three months is too long, and..."
I just wanna be with you.
Are you sure?
You're-you're making this decision for you?
Not me?
Not-not-not even us?
Uh...
Okay.
"Let's find a way to celebrate tonight, then-a fun way."
"We could, uh..."
Let's see.
You want to sneak 40s
"Into the midnight showing of ""the lost weekend"""
At film forum?
Oh!
"I have to say, Rose, I'm a little confused."
A little disappointed.
Everything was going so well.
"At least, I thought so."
Didn't you?
Is that the truth or some kind of female manipulation?
Tell me the truth.
"You knew the arrangement, how I felt."
Did you think that would change?
Why?
"I hoped, though I made the offer, you'd see there was no need for it."
I'd hoped that we'd gone beyond it.
Did you honestly think this was the next step?
What we have usually comes after all this nonsense is over.
Most people never get to where we are.
They try to keep the sex going.
Or find another.
"Our relationship works, because it isn't physical."
I took every precaution to make sure there was no physical attraction!
"Rose, I'm sorry."
I've never had this with a woman before.
I can share everything with you.
Are you not satisfied with me?
Maybe this is something we have to struggle through together.
Maybe this tour is coming at a good time.
Maybe we can use the distance.
Don't you think?
I thought we were good friends.
"Talk to me, Rose."
Let me in.
I'm sorry.
"No, nothing I can think of, nothing specific."
"And this Mr. Samuels, the guy who made a pass at you, did you complain in front of Daniel Zucco?"
"Ye-Yes, Neva, last night, and-and he listened very carefully."
"- Yes, he did."
"- Where did this ""Samuel"" live?"
"Oh, come on!"
"Hey, look, young lady."
It's 10:30.
"In a couple of hours,"
Daniel Zucco is gonna reach out of the grave and kill somebody.
"Now, I don't know what this Samuels did to you, but do you think he deserves to die for it?"
No.
He's out in Rockville Center.
So's the place where I work.
"From there to Midtown Manhattan, could it be done in less than two and a half hours?"
"[Neva] Yeah, you could do it in that easy."
- Crocker!
- [Ticking]
Go talk to her.
"[Sighs] Well, what does that mean?"
"I mean, what am I supposed to tell her?"
That I feel a certain kind of love for her?
That I feel a certain responsibility toward her?
"Well, I don't want to be in charge of an outpatient anymore."
"Honey, you will never know how hard I've worked on that relationship."
- It's over.
"- Alex, for three years,"
I sat at a desk not 15 feet away from you... on the other side of a tiny wall that thick.
I paid your bills.
I balanced your checkbook.
I mixed your drink.
I apologized to your psychiatrist when you didn't wanna see him.
"Well, yeah, that's why I didn't tell 'em."
"Growing up, I.A. was worse than the bogeyman in my house."
Then why take the job?
Because I want to be a detective.
"When I passed the exam, they gave me a choice--"
I.A. or back to patrol-- I took I.A.
Double chili cheeseburger.
You want something?
- No.
- Mm-hmm.
You hate the streets that much?
"No, it's just not my goal."
I did patrol because it was required.
Then just wait for another department to open up.
For how long?
I've already spent five years of my life on patrol.
Now I'm required to put in two more years on the job before I can even think about moving up to homicide.
Homicide?
That's your goal?
So that's how it is?
I.A.'s just another requirement.
"The minute your time's up with us, you're history?"
And I.A. was always your goal?
No.
But that's completely different.
I was pregnant with my first son.
I had to get off the street.
"I understand, but why are you so upset?"
Because I love this job.
"I may have joined I.A. because of the great hours, but I stay because I believe in what we do."
"Unlike you, I'm not just biding my time."
I am not biding my time.
~ Michael's not answering his phone.
~ What happened to your face?
Have you called the RVI?
What was Scottie doing exactly the last time you saw him?
"Getting a taxi, I think."
We were all stotious.
"Jo, maybe you should go back home and wait for him to turn up there."
~ (What?
") ~ Jo, if you think Scottie's done something stupid, you should be calling the police, not standing here staring at me after 36 hours."
Something stupid?
Like what?
My phone's still not working.
Can I use yours?
"Police, please."
"This way, please."
Sir?
~ Which one's the wife?
~ Er... it's the woman in the cream coat.
Who's the other two?
"The bloke is Peter Magath, the dead man's best mate, and that's his wife, Anita."
"Aye, look."
Have you seen the state of his face?
"They don't seem especially close, do they?"
She called in saying that she was worried about her missing husband and feared for his mental state.
Her description of her husband matches our man exactly.
I'll take them down.
"No, no."
"Rachel, you take her down."
Sit with her.
Watch her face and remember everything that she says.
"Afterwards, assuming it is her husband, bring her back here and if she wants to talk, let her talk, but don't tell her anything."
"And afterwards, you bring her back here and I'll come and find you."
Janeway to Voy...
Get up!
Get away from her!
Commander... any word on that tellerium?
Not yet.
How bad is it?
The antimatter reaction rate is down to 12 percent.
"If it drops below nine, the plasma injectors will lock up and we'll never be able to reinitialize the nacelles."
Options?
"If we're going to reduce our power demands even further, we're going to have to drop the shields."
I don't want to leave the ship defenseless this close to a hostile planet.
All other systems are already off-line.
Life support is at minimal.
You asked for options.
Thas our last one.
"All right, power down the shields."
That helped.
Is only a matter of time.
There's nothing more we can do without the tellerium.
Neelix to Voyager.
"Yes, Neelix."
"The rest of the away team is gone, Commander."
They've been taken by the Mokra.
What do you want me to do?
Did you get the tellerium?
"Yes, I have it."
Then we need you here.
Prepare to beam directly to Engineering.
Rerouting emergency power to Transporter Room 2.
And... energizing.
Chakotay to away team.
"Captain, can you hear me?"
Eric sure is taking an awfully long time with those sodas.
[Laughing]
"I'm sure it's no reflection on you, Lance."
He probably just wants to make sure a good friend like you... gets the freshest soda available.
"I know Eric doesn't like me, Mrs. Forman."
I only came over for the chance to see my beautiful Donna.
And after I make my fortune in robots...
"I'm gonna come back to this Podunk town and buy whatever flour mill Eric is working at... fire him, and make Donna my wife."
You're a creepy kid.
You know that?
"Mrs. Forman, I think we both know the real reason you invited me over here."
"You're after Mother's coveted peach cobbler recipe, no?"
Your mom makes peach cobbler?
I had no idea.
"Please, let's speak frankly."
"I have something you want, and you have something I want."
W-We're not in a- in a position to just give you Donna.
We could give you Eric.
Mother tasted your stuffing at the Thanksgiving Turkey Trot... and ever since then she's wanted the recipe.
I've been instructed to arrange a swap.
Don't you have any weird friends to play with?
Friends are for the weak.
"Okay, you guys."
MeetJulie.
"She's got two horses, a brand-new Firebird... and her dad works for Six Flags!"
"[All] Hello, Julie!"
"Hey, Hyde."
Love your hair.
You can touch it if you want.
"Oh, get lost, skankoid."
We're all full.
"Damn, Jackie!"
No!
You fucking roadkill.
Who... who kept wide eyes... when she jaws?
What?
We're on a deadline and there's a shortage of interns.
Bullshit.
I have appointments and I need someone to carry my Polaroid.
"- But we need her, darling."
- Get Foofy.
- I don't know where Foofy is.
- Filing cards for upcoming shoots.
You know we only use 5 models anyway.
Are you an idiot?
No!
So don't act like one.
So here is the trick for getting free stuff:
"You call Louis Vuitton, call in 4 bags and send back 3."
"The next day, call in 2 and send back 1..."
Then call in 5 and send back 4.
When they ask you to cough up... this luggage you delay and tell them it's on a shoot in Barbados.
"Until you find somebody over there quit, which is weekly."
And say you just sent it back to Sheila and fake surprise... when they say she left the company.
- No way.
- Lf they keep questioning you... tell them you messengered it over to Vogue.
An editor requested it.
- That's hilarious!
- Works every time.
"Hello, Louis V."
This soup is delicious.
It beats throwing an acceptable layout away.
It's such a chaos over there.
This whole Yuri hassle journey... is insane.

"81-54, how long does it take you to get there?"
I can be there in four minutes.
Do you want to drive me home?
I think my car is stolen.
Father!
Is it really you?
Shall we go and bathe now?
After all these years ... and alle the pigs I've had around me   Should I lie here alone with a cop.
How it ends for most thugs.
Their only fixed point is the cop who followed them.
What do you want?

"Hvisjeg was revealed, I thought, police management would help me."
Have you wondered why we live under a death threat?
Answer me!
Is it our fault?
He ar works for you!
It is your responsibility!
I thought I would get help but that did not happen.
"I have a closer look at the nemmelsen, that police management would see me dead."
Despite the police's own lawyer has exposed me to a lawyer.

Thank you.
(CHUCKLING)
"Well, you're absolutely amazing, sir."
You're right.
And here I thought you were in shock.
"No, you didn't."
You thought I was confused.
Perhaps scared.
And probably playing for time.
Amazing.
What makes you think her murder was premeditated?
"The usual thing, sir."
"Little facts that plain don't fit, you know, sir."
"Anything I hate, it's one of those little facts."
"Doesrt ever seem to matter how small it is, either, sir."
It could be this big.
Like he left the credit cards behind.
"I mean, why does a street robber grab money from a wallet and leave the credit cards?"
They're won'th a pretty good piece of change on the black market.
"You see what I mean, sir?"
Credit cards.
What else?
"Oh, there was an alligator bag."
A diamond ring.
"I doubt very much if a robber in a hurry, on the edge of panic, is gonna take the time to pull the ring off of Claire's finger."
Of course.
Look at that face.
And he's even more beautiful in person.
"Whoa, whoa!"
Wait a minute.
You know Jesse?
From when he came into the office.
Swoon.
He let me take my picture with him.
"Yeah, there he is."
"Thanks, Janet."
"You met Jesse, and you didn't tell me?"
What was he doing here?
"Sometimes when famous people have trouble with fans, they come to us for help."
And that is all I can say because of...?
Confidentiality.
That's my little lawyer.
Okay.

"Hey, thanks for hearing us out, Mr. Price."
"You be good, Serena, or you know who's gonna hear about it?"
Captain Nico!
"Hang on one second, sweetie."
Mr. Jackson.
"If there were anything I could do to ease your family's pain, I would do it."
So I hope I can count on you not to pursue the matter through my wife.
"Sure thing, Mr. Price."
"'Cause you and me, we both know how important it is to be able to count on somebody."

Then I tell her all I've seen.
These last four years have been the richest in my life.
"Looking after Alicia, doing the things she liked to do, except traveling, of course."
"For me, it's the opposite with Lydia."
How come?
I can't even touch her.
I don't recognize her body.
I can't even help the nurses to turn her over in the bed.
And I feel so despicable.
Talk to her.
Tell her that.
"I'd like to, but she can't hear me."
Why are you so sure about that?
Because her brain is turned off.
"A woman's brain is a mystery, and in this state even more so."

"Benigno, what experience have you had with women?"
What?
What experience have you had with women?
Me?
A lot.

"Rest assured, there will be progress."

So we won't be playing ping pong?
"You must certainly have some princely motto, say:"
"Wherever I appear, the scum disappears."
The barefoot...
"""The Barefoot Contessa"", one might say."
Mankiewicz.
She saw her mother die at the hands of the Venoms.
The four Venom brothers.
Like Mickey's four fingers.
I've only wanted what's good for Mary.
But she seeks her mother's fate.
What can one do...
"Two days before retiring,"
"And still sizing up guys who sell both the cannons and the fodder, the catchphrases."
"But I keep trying, with the wild horses."
"Mickey, you, the limpet."
1000 to 1.
The luxury of desperate gamblers.
"I could give you back to your Hungary, but I'd rather release you into our wild."
"I'll take Mr André's statement democratically, like the Pope's edict."
And I'll keep sniffing your scent.
Francois.!
Kali.!
Come here.!
"Look here, Smith."
Why can't we do business?
"I'm always open to an honest proposition, Mr. Thornton."
"We'll give you the claim, all of it."
You can have what gold we've got.
But leave us some way of getting out of here.
The winter snows are coming on.
"My dear man, you call that a business proposition?"
"We already have the mine, and the gold is ours by right of-"
How shall I put it?
By right of conquest.
Do you mind if we don't argue the point anymore?
Let's help ourselves.
Mr. Thornton would only squander the gold.
"I must commend your sense of humor, Mr. Thornton."
Very few people would be able to smile on an occasion like this.
- Thank you.
- Not at all.
I remember watching a magician once.
"From an apparently empty hat, he shortly produced a rabbit."
"He smiled very much as you're smiling now... because, I imagine, he knew all the while... that he had that rabbit up his sleeve."
"You've something up your sleeve, perhaps."
Perhaps.
"Roll up your sleeve, Mr. Thornton."
There's no rabbit there.
"Come, come."
Don't let's strain our friendship.
Madam.
"Careful, you idiot."
"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are....
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
With a tremendously big sound... the ground started shaking.
Suzukichi was terrified.
He didn't move.
Maybe.
What did you want him to do?
The Yankees will move on.
Barney has to live here.
With that sly deal with the devil that everybody in this parish seems to have struck.
(Bloody Moybeg.)
"It's life, Rose."
We're lucky to be able to hold on to it.
Sometimes you have to use a long spoon to dine with the devil.
Especially when you're dining on corned beef.
Uh?
Nothing.
Are you sorry?
About what?
I don't know.
About the trouble you caused?
It wasn't my fault.
- You went to the pictures.
"- ""You went to the pictures""."
Neh!
"It didn't mean they had to gang up on him, the Hanlons and all, and shut up about it."
Do you think they would have killed him if Mum hadn't have...
PLANES ROAR OVERHEAD
Battle Fatigue!
Barnhill.
"Brave, decent Barnhill didn't long survive his rescue by my mother."
"A swarm of Focke Wulf 190s set on him over Dusseldorf, one moonlit night in 1944, and though he fought a long-running battle towards the Channel, he never made it."
"He is buried among the small farmyards, the barns and byres of St Joseph, close to Wormhout in Belgium."
I often wonder what my father knew about that night.
Did he decide to let Barnhill get what was coming to him for his cheek?
"I hope not, but my father was a Moybeg man."
Its darkness may have lain somewhere deep in his DNA.
"- [muscles] come on, let me out."
- Everybody ok?
"- [all kids] yeah, sure."
"Oh, look what's happened to city property."
No...
But I'm still gonna take you to school.
- Just soon as I...
- Come on.
[siren approaching]
You jeopardized my life's work.
My accountants' are desperate.
You've proved yourself incompetent yet again.
I don't even know if I can trust you anymore.
You don't trust me?
I trusted you enough
To make my credit rating look like Swiss cheese.
Don't tell me you don't trust me.
We have to trust each other.
Right.
I trust everybody.
Yes...
"Well, fortunately,"
I thought of something very spectacular
Which will satisfy both of us in terms of prestige and money.
"Well, you have the prestige, I'll take the money."
"But, before we celebrate your return to sanity,"
We'd better do something about Tony's sister.
How did she know we were at the museum?
I...
I'm not certain.
Tony.
How did your sister know that we were at the museum?
"It depends on your definition of ""people,"""
and that's enough of a technicality to keep your lawyers dizzy for centuries.
"Take me to court, then, Doctor, and watch me smile and cry and flutter."
And creak?
And what?
"""Creak."" You're creaking."
What?
Ah!
I-I'm drying out.
"Oh, sweet heavens."
Moisturize me!
Moisturize me!
Where are my surgeons?
My lovely boys!
It's too hot!
You raised the temperature.
Have pity.
Moisturize me!
"Oh, oh, Doctor!"
Help her.
Everything has its time and everything dies.
I'm...too... young.
And I love how the Doctor's so callous with her.
"Like when Rose is like ""Aren't you going to save her?"""
"And he's just like ""Everything has an end."""
"Poof! ""Aah!"" Bits of liver flying out."
"Eccleston, as the Doctor, just kills her, you know?"
"Like, he doesn't have any problem with saying this is justice -- she has to die for being bad guy."
"The way that he deals with her, versus the way that the tenth Doctor will later deal with her really kind of speaks volumes about the difference between the two of them."
They just create fully grown human beings out of tissue samples.
"Hello, Dad."
You just get the sense that you shouldn't mess with her.
But let me tell you something.
I'd rather blow one in 100 than send 10 men away on mandatories who don't deserve them.
You sound like an enlightened man.
And you sound like you're fucking with me.
"You have anything to add, Abe?"
It's okay.
You're doing fine.
Everybody will want to know how these things happen.
How long have you been on this job?
Three years.
"Look, these things happen because we are awash here."
"In criminals, in half-baked social workers in a city that doesn't function, in a world that doesn't know right from wrong."
- Mr. Schwartz?
- Larry.
I owe you an apology.
No apologies.
I came in here with a big head of steam.
It was inappropriate.
"Look, it takes more than 3 years to get up to speed in this department."
Only one man would have made a good probation officer:
Kafka.
And he wasn't available.
"Thank you, Larry."
Call me if something opens up in the big building.
"You know, keep me in mind."
He'll be right with you.
South Brooklyn Democratic Club.
I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever.
Have your son stop by.
I'll be happy to take care of it.
"Gussie, come on in."
"Hello, Mr. Anselmo."
"No, never it would make a thing thus, but it is precise that it comes with me."
That it goes where?
-To accompany.
-Where?
It does not touch to me.
"-The request, comes with me."
-To where I must accompany to him.
I will explain it.
In the ambulance there is a young person of only 20 years... in touch between the life and the death...
And what I can do?
It watches in what state is.
It sees it?
Here he is.?
How it goes?
poor.
"Yes, poor, is in evil been."
He is on the verge of dying.
And it knows which are the words that continue repeating in their delirium?
I love a woman.
Before dying... it would want the incommensurable one to please to see a woman.
"It is right, poor"
"He hears, you you would only have to do this:"
"to enter there, to open themselves just a little bit, to embosom a little to him the legs..."
But...
"Do it, will make a good karma and tomorrow all the angels of the sky will sing your name."
-Which is her name?
-Brígida Bonazzi.
Brígida Bonazzi.
"Yes, all the angels of the sky they will sing: ""Brígida Bonazzi,..."""
"Salt of there, salt of there."
"It enters there, enters there..."
Brígida Bonnazzi.
- Great song.
- It's a great song.
"I'm seeing some of the faces in the background and remembering all these people that we spent, like, two weeks with."
There was one female extra that had a thing for Kat.
- One female extra?
- Just one.
"One that came up and said something, but half a dozen had their eye on you."
"A little, like, ""Oh, yeah."""
"There was one female extra, blond girl in a hat, female extra who worked her way into every shot in the first third of the movie."
Really?
"You know what, I have to say it was a point of frustration."
"Because I felt like every shot we cut to, she'd snuck in there."
We should call Rafi and see if he has anything he wants to say.
All you have to do is put an ADR...
"Put an ADR line like, ""Oh, the O'Malley triplets are here tonight."""
- Jeez.
- They're all over the place.
This moment was reshot.
"- Yeah, this was reshot."
- That thing that just happened.
"Oh, yeah."
"Now, Pete, did we use the reshot kiss or the original kiss here?"
- We reshot the kiss.
- The reshot kiss.
"- Okay, because there were a few..."
- Why did you reshoot the kiss?
Because Rafi wasn't handsome enough in the background.
"If you look now, look at the face he makes."
- Not handsome.
- It is stunning.
- Everyone's...
"- I mean, look at that."
The pressure's off.
Do you know how much pressure I felt?
Do you?
"All last week, I felt like a giant man and his brother were sitting on my chest."
- A giant man?
- And his giant brother.
- Did they have names?
- Clem and Clem.
Same names.
Which did not reflect well on their mothers' imagination.
- Mother.
- Mothers.
There were two Clems.
- 'Cause they were brothers.
"- Yes, so they had mothers."
You're drawing me into your drunken world.
"It's not a bad place to be, my friend."
Tank's empty.
- What is this?
- What?
This life plan book thing.
A gift for the grads from the happy people at Hartford Community College.
"Hey, how many margaritas is too many margaritas?"
If you can't remember where the living room is.
I'm still good.
"Okay, here's an interesting question for you."
'Have you given any thought to how children will work into your future plans?
'
"They're not gonna stand in my way, that's for sure."
"I plan to have some, of course, but I'm just gonna knock them out... and have nanny catch them and care for them... make sure Mick Jagger doesn't come near them... and then return them to me when they're 21."
What about me?
You are my favorite eldest child.
Go to the market with her.
Very well.
What's so funny?
You're always giggling!
But they're tomatoes!
I suggested we go to the air-conditioned and clean Foodland.
But Aunt had to insist...
"It's not good to buy vegetables from such a dirty place, aunt."
"We have you with us for safety, don't we?"
Would you like some ladyfinger?
"Go and get some bunches of fenugreek from there, aunt."
Why must you need something so bitter?
"Papa loves it, aunt."
Give it to him everyday... and he'll will all his property to you.
If only fenugreek could get his property...
"Two kilos each of potatoes, tomatoes and ladyfinger."
Has Uncle spoken to you?
About what?
"About us, that is..."
Could we have some gourd?
What insolence is this?
!
Was that insolence?
What d'you think you're doing?
"No English, feller!"
You need a slap to rid you of your shamelessness!
Don't mess with him.
Let's move.
He held my hand!
And you talk of going away!
"Talk to me, lady!"
Never mind this chap.
"I'll fix engagement next week as you wish,"
I'll make other arrangements.
"Sister...congratulations, your engagement is fixed next week."
- He ignored me.
- Who?
Who else?
That kick guy!
Bloody idiot!
Is Kalyan here?
When?
Where?
Why are you so excited?
Why did he ignore me?
I am sure he's here to ruin my life.
"It's him, right?"
It's not him...it's not him...
it's him...
I'm sure it's him.
We believe that you'll catch that thief.
You need any help sir?
I need a journalist.
I'm here for my partner.
I'll definitely find him.
"Your interview was rocking, your still in the paper is very glamourous."
You've a good photogenic face.
Have you settled in Malaysia?
How's your accommodation?
"Very good, but weather is hot like you."
"I thought you'd come to marry here, have you come here cracking my clue to catch me?"
"I feel like shaking hands with you, will you give me a chance?"
"Don't rush off buddy,"
I'll put handcuffs if I get you not shake hands with you.
Have you checked out their movement?
They're still at the inn.
Will they return to BuYeo?
"If they know who we are, they will not mobilize the fleet so easily."
We will ambush them the moment they are about to leave Heng-In.
We must capture that rascal So Seo-No alive and bring her to me.
Is that understood?
"Yes, Commander."
Miss!
Miss!
What else is there to mull over?
All the workers don't wish to die before they return home.
Please give us the order to withdraw.
"Sa-Yong,"
"Yes, Miss."
"If father were here, what would he do?"
Chief isn't a reckless person.
You think that my frustration is an act of recklessness?
"Judging from our strength, we can't possibly hope to take them on."
We should flee from a battle that we cannot win.
"Actually, I... would have liked to brave the danger to reach Go-San Nation."
Miss!
Father wants to test my competence... through this expedition.
This I am aware of.
That's why I want to give it all I've got.
Please continue.
"But like what Uncle Gye-Pil said,"
I will not put the workers in danger just because of my selfishness.
Prepare to withdraw.
"Miss, I'm glad you said that."
"Hey,"
Just in time.
"By killing Cuddappah Raja for these people, you've kept up your father's promise."
How are you going to save your father who is in Konda Reddy's custody?
I know where my father is.
I will come back with my father.
You leave this place with these people.
Welcome!
Are you Singamuthu's son?
You can't find your father.
Konda Reddy has entered your people's camp.
You don't know about him.
He can knock 3 heads in one swing.
I don't know how many would have died by now.
Your men are going to die there.
And you're going to die here.
Catch him.
Get everyone into the bus.
Leave no child.
Get every child into the bus.
"When we locked up Singamuthu, your boss, everyone worked in fear."
"Now that his son is back, have you lost your fear?"
Get every child into the bus.
"Sir, all are innocent children."
Give us any punishment.
Don't harm them.
"Look, your children will be taken to Bihar or Orissa."
"If anyone tries to escape, we will cut your children's limbs and make them beg on Bombay streets."
Leave my brother.
Tell them to leave my brother.
How will they leave your brother?
You should've thought before doing something.
I told you but you never listened to me.
Now Singamuthu's son beat their men.
So.
"You're just here to help me get information about Gus Walker, huh?"
That's right.
"Glass of Chardonnay for the lady, please."
Thanks.
"Come on, Jack."
You don't have any new information for me.
You just want to get to Walker's files to see if there's anything in there about your friend Fredel.
Not gonna work.
Come on.
Can't a guy do two things at once?
I liked Gus.
"You know, he was a major talent."
Agreed.
"The tragedy of this thing is that he lived in fear because of how controversial his work was, but this last series wasn't political at all."
So you followed his career.
Even after you stopped working for him?
"I'm not nearly as... one-dimensional as you think I am,"
Special Agent Henson.
"Oh, is that right?"
"You know, that's what Walker was trying to say with these photos."
It was about the way we perceive one another.
An issue that you are sensitive about.
Maybe.
Are you?
"You're wasting my time, Jack."
"I mean, what'd you do?"
Run an Internet search on the guy or something?
I'm interested in his work.
Uh-huh.
[dialing cell phone]
"Let's talk about this latest series, right?"
I was a better teacher because of you.
- Fresh pepper?
"- Not for her, but I'll have some."
Could you bring her a side dish of dressing?
She likes a little extra.
I feel I should return the favors.
Is there anything I can do for you?
I'll have to think about that.
Just glop it on.
Enjoy your dinner.
- You're not eating.
"- No, I'm watching your ritual."
"I just about got your sequence now, I think."
"You start by rotating the plate counterclockwise, cut on the diagonal, remove unwanted elements, and now comes my favorite part, the loading of the fork."
"It's fascinating, the percentages you use of different vegetables to create that one harmoniously balanced, perfect bite."
Mmm.
You have a little...
Don't smear it.
That might stain.
You might want to put a little soap on that.
I'll be right back.
Mmm.
I want to ask you something.
- Don't stop.
- I'm not a machine.
"We both have overwhelming feelings for each other, don't we?"
- You're doing great.
Keep it up.
- Okay.
Ready?
- Doesn't that music infuriate you?
"- Yeah, I'm livid."
- Things don't end this suddenly.
"- Yes, they do."
"No, they don't."
"Look, I don't know if things end this way or not... but what we had together is over."
"We'll go on Saturday, then."
For one night.
You can choose a romantic inn.
"Pedro Paulo, my darling."
Former spouses don't travel together to romantic inns.
"Technically speaking, we're not former spouses yet."
"Technically speaking, I wouldn't travel with you... if my life depended on it."
MasterJockstrap won't let you go?
If you break into my apartment again...
- Our apartment.
- My apartment.
And you're forbidden to go in when I'm not there.
Does thejapanese guy look sexy in his jockstrap?
He's notJapanese.
He's Chinese.
These Orientals are perverted.
Has he asked you to perform any strange acts yet?
"There are no ""strange acts"" for people with open minds."
Don't let him tie you up in bed.
These guys will steal your furniture.
"What do you mean ""these guys""?"
Have you gone mad?
Japanese always travel in groups.
Give me back the key.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
- I was swimming.
- No problem.
When do we start?
Today?
Can we make it official?
I don't mind it.
Ah!
Can I say on SNS that I'm dating Sin Joon Young?
Welcome.
"Noona, what's with the both of you?"
"I don't know, I think she caused a problem again."
She's been like this for thirty minutes.
Do you think you'll die like that?
Did you cause another problem?
I'll get fired from Sin Joon Young's documentary.
Huh?
I think I'll get fired from Sin Joon Young's documentary.
Why?
I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a variety show as a documentary.
"I mean, I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a documentary as a variety show."
"No, no."
I took what Sin Joon Young meant to be a documentary as a documentary.
- What are you saying?
- I think she went crazy.
I'm not crazy!
"Why are you always only like that towards me, Unni?"
"Since you look down on me like that, everyone else in the world doesn't take me seriously and looks down on me."
"You can't even make a sound to Sin Joon Young,"
"You don't say anything about him being crazy, but how come you only call me psycho?"
Am I that easy?
This little...
Hey!
Was I unable to say anything to Sin Joon Young?
"The real question is, why are you being like that to me?"
"- Yeah, a plain wrap..."
"And, well, it was about marriage and sex."
I had it sent to me at the post office.
It took me two weeks to get up the courage to go pick it up.
Look... .
"I know it sounds funny, but it was the only way I could find out anything."
"Norman, you know what?"
I sent for a book just like that in the same plain wrapper general delivery.
"- No, really?"
The same one?
"And I read every word of it, and I think most of it's mid-Victorian nonsense."
Maybe yours was better.
"Hey, want to trade books?"
No.
I'd be too embarrassed.
"That's your whole trouble, Norman."
Everything embarrasses you.
Everything frightens you.
I know.
And I'm sorry we started talking about all this.
"Hey, Norman, look... ."
It's about time you learned that girls want to do the same things as boys.
And they have the right to know how.
"I mean, I think we should help each other."
- Are you suggesting that...?
"- Norman, don't get me wrong."
"All I want is some normal, intelligent discussion and maybe some normal affection between a boy and a girl, nothing more."
Everybody in this town hides behind plain wrappers.
You're so afraid.
You've even been afraid to ask me to the graduation dance.
"Allison, I want... ."
"Well, see, I'm just not asking anybody."
Our artists have been up all night making their costumes.
It's terribly exciting!
You're not acting in this piece?
I have no stomach for farce.
I am here to cue you.
"When I signal you like so, you must play something which suggests rain."
I expect this will be very amusing.
Yes.
Alfred and George have really outdone themselves this time.
"Do you know, I think they are still in love with each other."
(KNOCKING)
- Clap.
- Good evening.
I am God.
"I have grown disappointed in my master creation, the human race."
I endowed them with everything.
"The riches of the land, sea and air."
And enough intelligence to worship me.
But they have become arrogant and pampered.
I shall destroy them.
All except for one man and his family.
DUCHESS:
Ah!
This is my servant Noah and his wife Noette and their children.
Into their hands do I place the future of mankind.
"Oh, this heat!"
Will it never rain?
Here sits my stupid lout of a husband.
I don't know what God sees in him.
"Ah, who can express the despair of youth married to age?"
My husband is 600 years old while I am but 150!
A dove!
Didn't you say that the cops suspected Petty stole his mines from Presidio back in '60?
"Yeah, and they never found his stash."
Searched all the tunnels and cellars.
No luck.
Or maybe he hid them where he knew no one would look.
W-w-warm in here.
It's nice.
What's next?
Crumpets?
How's that?
Feel like a new man.
"Now that's how you treat someone you want something from, Warden."
"Glad you approve, son."
But I've heard about the mind games in here.
What have you heard?
I'm not taking these pills.
"They're not pills, Mr. Petty."
Those are mints.
I drugged your tea.
Just a mild sedative to help you relax.
An anesthetic.
You were only 18 when you joined the marines.
Is that right?
I'm not talking to you.
"You served for the fighting 15th, were part of the Chosin Reservoir battle, the bloodiest of the war."
14 silver stars were awarded to the veterans of the Chosin Reservoir battle.
But not you.
"Despite clearing several frozen minefields by yourself, under heavy fire, providing safe passage for our troops to advance."
"Hypocrites, the lot of 'em."
It's for your safety.
"Were you scared, Mr. Petty?"
"No, ma'am."
"He didn't believe in theater, he always used to mock my dreams, and I ended up not believing in them, either."
I lost courage!
"And then the turmoils of love, the jealousy, the constant fear for my little one."
"I was becoming petty, insignificant,"
"My acting was stupid, I didn't know what to do with my hands."
I couldn't control my voice.
"You don't know what it feels like,"
knowing that you act atrociously.
I am a seagull.
"Since I came here I've been walking a lot,"
"I walk, and I think intensely, and I can feel my soul strengthening."
"I know now,"
"I understand, Kostia,"
"That in our trade, artist or writer, the essential is neither the glory, nor the sparkles, all that I dreamt of."
The essential is to know how to endure.
Learn to carry your cross and keep your faith.
Here's the item.
It's intact.
"Now, let's talk details."
"Abhorrent, isn't it?"
"Are they plotting, or what?"
Our fiancées.
Here's a doll.
"Here's the head, here's the feet."
I turn her upside down.
"Close your eyes, close your eyes."
There!
Show me where the head is?
"Now, her feet."
And now her sex.
"That's a good one, huh?"
Isn't it?
That isn't a problem now.
I hope my question didn't annoy you.
"No, no, not at all."
Was her father here?
Yes.
Heasked meifiwasafaggot.
You're kidding!
"Well, he used the American expression, it's more subtle."
What was my orientation?
What did you say?
That I'm into men.
Really?
"No, silly, I lied to him."
How dare he ask me jf I like men or women?
Who cares?
"Well, I'm glad to know."
Did he ask the head nurse if she's a dyke?
Did he ask you if you like bestiality or coprophagy?
"No, you're right."
You don't ask things like that.
"I may have to travel, so I can't come and see you every week."
"But, in Geneva, they've offered me a creation, a choreography, and that thrills me,"
I've got an old idea for a ballet.
"It's called ""Trenches""."
It's about World War I.
Problem.
"You need lots of male dancers because in the war, sorry, there are lots of soldiers."
But in Geneva everyone dances.
It's wonderful.
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"""
"in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
- Not too far.
You've been saying that for miles.
- My feet are sore.
- When did you become older than me?
"Tell me what this new breakfast place is, and I'll be quiet."
It an amazing new mystery place I found.
That's all I'm telling you.
Is it in this town or the next?
- We don't patronize the next town.
- Since when?
Didn't they feed lead to our jumping frog or something?
Right after they stoned the woman who won the lottery.
"See, so the boycott's legit."
- Wait.
Stop.
"- Look, it's Michael Landon."
You guys walk fast.
I've been chasing you the past two blocks.
We were being followed.
I told you I wasn't being paranoid.
Now you'll believe me when I say the furniture moved itself.
- Where're you going?
- Mystery breakfast.
- Out of town?
- Remember the definition of mystery?
I was wondering if it's okay to practice on your pots and pans again.
It's not like they have any other use.
I've almost nailed Ramble On.
I have to stop hitting my face with the sticks when I pull back.
John Bonham had that same problem.
- Key is in the turtle.
- Enjoy your mystery breakfast.
"Would you just name it, for God's sakes?"
What is it?
-Do you have any religious beliefs?
- No.
What about your daughter?
No.
Why?
Have you ever heard of exorcism?
"Well, it's a stylized ritual in which the, uh, rabbi or the priest try to drive out the so-called invading spirit."
"It's been pretty much discarded these days except by the Catholics, who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment."
"But it, uh, has worked, in fact although not for the reasons they think, of course."
It's purely force of suggestion.
"The, uh-"
- The victim's belief in possession is what helped cause it so in that same way the belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
You're telling me that I should take my daughter to a witch doctor.
Is that it?
Karl?
Did you put this in Regan's bedroom?
She's going to be well?
"Karl, if you put this in Regan's bedroom, I want you to tell me."
"Now, did you?"
"No, not me."
I didn't.
This was under Regan's pillow.
Did you put it there?
"Of course, I didn't."
I didn't put it.
"Excuse me, madam."
-What?
-A man to see you.
- What man?
"Might your daughter remember, perhaps if Mr. Dennings was in her room that night?"
!
Don't flatter yourself.
I couldn't care less about a spoiled kid like you.
You're simply a diversion to lure away the palace's eyes.
What?
!
Let me fill you in on a little secret.
We're going to kill the empress.
What did you say?
!
You're going to kill Her Majesty?
!
Do you seriously think you can do anything that absurd?
!
Is killing the empress really that absurd?
We're going to destroy those detestable Outer Terrans and become the rulers of this planet.
I won't let anyone stop us from attaining our rightful place.
"No, not even you, Ion!"
All eyes at the palace are on you at the moment.
"I thank you, tovaras."
Damn you...
Are you that concerned for Esther?
Looks like I guessed right.
"But are you sure it's wise, Ion?"
"She's not only a Terran, but a member of the Vatican."
So what if she is?
!
"My point is, do you really want to be betrayed yet again?"
How do you think I predict every single move you make?
Are you saying Esther is betraying me?
!
What rubbish!
I just figured it all out.
It's just like you said.
I'm your insurance policy.
What are you talking about?
"Well, as long as I'm your hostage, they can't get to you."
"You can demand a ransom from my father... we'll take the money, we'll escape to Mexico just like you said."
"Hey, hey, hey."
"Hold on a minute here, Patty Hearst."
- What?
"- On second thought, maybe Mexico ain't such a hot idea."
We'll have to wait in line at the border while they check the trunk for illegal fruit.
"- I mean, come on."
"- No, I'm completely serious."
They'll never be able to get us.
I'm your hostage.
There's no way they could possibly think we're in this together.
It's getting close.
It's getting real close.
"Subject vehicle, red BMW... now approaching with suspect and hostage."
- All officers take your positions.
- Move!
Come on!
Come on!
Prepare to engage suspect.
All emergency services remain in position.
"Fire, be ready with foam."
"Paramedics, stand by."
- This could actually work.
"- Yes, it's gonna work."
It's gonna work.
- All right.
- I know this beautiful spot in Cabo San Lucas... where the beaches are gorgeous.
But every bit of you hammering away at my wall of denial is what finally brought it down.
So I'm here to tell you thank you...
Because now I feel like I can finally move forward with my life.
"You're welcome, Louis."
And I think that this means that you're officially ready.
"- Uh, for what?"
- To take back the associates.
"Okay, Donna, no, I appreciate that."
But they're yours now.
"They were never mine, Louis."
I was always just taking care of them for you.
I don't know how I can repay you.
You just did.

"Louis, if you're here for the Stevenson brief,"
I can have it to you in the morning.
"Go home, Brian."
Am I fired?
"Nope, there's just more to life than working here."
Am I being punked?
"No, not at all."
"It's just that you have a new supervisor starting tomorrow, and he would like you to get a good night's sleep."
And he told you to tell me that?
"Oh, Jesus, Brian, please, will you work with me?"
I'm the new supervisor.
"And listen, I am sorry for saying all those horrible things to you about undedicated."
I can't even imagine how you balance being a new dad with this workload.
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
"Before you go, I got you a little something."
"Louis, this is the best onesie a man has ever gotten another man."
Himmler is already in Madrid and soon he'll go to Montserrat.
"He doesn't know anything, right?"
-He's unaware of the time door.
He's going to look for the Holy Grail.
Or at least that's what history tells us.
History.
"I would love to be able to travel in time and change it, I swear."
That's what we're doing.
"Yes, that's what we're doing."
-Let's go.
Madrid is full of spies.
And Juan and Luis?
-They're safe.
Leave immediately for Montserrat.
Destroy that door before the Nazis find it.
You two will travel to Hendaye.
"If they don't manage to destroy the door, you need to stop Spain from entering World War II."
By whatever means neccessary.
I look like a puppet.
"No complaining, I don't even want to think about when we travel to meet Viriatus."
"I knew that this day would come, but traveling to my own future terrifies me."
In 1940 I'll be over 80 years old.
This is only 60 years after your time.
Imagine how I feel on every trip.
It's almost better to travel farther than closer.
It's the memories that kill you.
"You're lucky, you can't ever travel to the future."
So you'll never know what will become of your life.
My future doesn't interest me as much as my past.
"Yes, too much sometimes."
"Anyway, past, future..."
What does it matter?
Four.
Four.
Don was supposed to go Jerilderie
"Don was supposed to go Jerilderie to see a Mr Adams about furnishing a house, to see a Mr Adams about furnishing a house, except a family friend died suddenly except a family friend died suddenly and he had to help with the funeral."

You don't.

Are you sure it was a Ford?

Sam...
It looks okay?
"Uh, you've got a stab wound to your abdomen."
"If you ask me, you're lucky that's all you got."
What about Tammy and... and Michelle?
Is the baby okay?
"Oh, so you're worried about them now?"
"A little bit late for that, don't you think?"
"So he says, ""she's not dead."
"She's just electroencephalographically challenged."""
So it looks like everybody is settling in.
Yes.
"Thank you, Dr. Bennett."
It's good to be here.
Okay.
"Well, if you, uh, need anything, just let me know."
My door is always open.
Interesting dynamic.
"Even a group of top-notch, einstein-type professionals feel the urge to get out of the room when the boss comes in."
"Oh, well... they'll warm up once we all get to know each other."
Yeah.
So have you had the chance to see Violet and Luke?
"Pete's been telling me it's a bad time, politely, as he blocks the door and refuses to let me pass."
H... has he said anything to you?
"Um, they're... kinda not talking to me up there."
"But, uh, Addison and I actually had a real conversation this morning, so hopefully things will get back to normal soon."
What?
"Nothing, nothing."
"It's just... well, another interesting dynamic."
Not that!
How can you think I'd tell him that?
"- Alan, I'm not accusing you."
"- Yes, you are."
"You're accusing me of this, and yet you refuse to accuse me of having an affair."
That hurts.
"Cory, I know you look up to your brother, but I want you to go to your father for advice on this subject."
Eric has some explaining to do about his own behavior with girls lately.
- I know.
- What do you know?
Pretty much everything.
I kind of walked in on them.
♪ Amazing grace... ♪
- On Eric and his friend in our room?
- How could this happen?
"Dad, Rebecca sat down on the bed and went like this..."
"Oh, so this is her fault."
And you bear no responsibility?
"- Clearly, I should have locked the door."
"- Eric, you're missing the point."
"No, I know the point, Dad."
"I should have controlled myself, but nothing happened."
"Eric, Eric, you are in so deep."
"Dad, I'm sorry."
"I mean, I'm really, really s..."

- Dad?
- Learn her name!

I haven't been saying anything!
You don't think I have enough problems without people thinking
I'm going around stomping other people's teeth out?
Do I need that?

Then who's been saying it then?
"There's ""Got your back"" guys and ""I'll be back"" guys."

Dr. Raymond hated his job because he didn't get paid enough.

Any idea who might've given Patrick the love bite ?
Um... just between us ?
Patrick used to always make time with the undesirables.
He cheated on Jennie three times senior year.
Any of those ladies here today ?
Michelle Day.
Wouldn't exactly call her a lady.
Can brother come along too?
Everyone has a free will.
They can come if they want or not come... if they don't want to.
It doesn't make a difference to me.
How much is this for?
You dare attack from behind?
Come on put it in neutral.
Who is it?
Jabbar sir it wasn't us.
Here.
Get your self treated.
Here.
Goodbye.
That's Jabbar the beggar...
What happened?
Did the tank explode?
No you've been exposed.
Take look.
Look.
Last night was the most embarrassing night... in the History of politics.
The entire country was shocked to see this.
25 MLA s of minister Vishwas Pradhan... were caught along with prostitutes late in the night... and in front of the entire media.
The unknown person that informed the media... calls himself a social-worker.
This is a conspiracy of the opposition.
The parliament speaker... has decided to suspend all the MLA s.
And the ruling have given a statement that... they are ready for a hung assembly...
But they will never take the support of these MLA s.
I am ruined.
My power's gone.
And wife too.
Rascal swine pervert.

There's no trace of kara and brainiac.
I can't let lana sit in that asylum in pain.
The only way to help her is to find brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
"I mean, there's no bogey or blip unaccounted for."
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was lionel luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, Mr. Luthor, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Yeah.
- As for you...
Rebecca.
Her name was Rebecca.
- Is that all you know about her?
"- Well, not too much more, I guess."
- Does that make you feel good?
"- No, it doesn't."
"Eric, every once in a while, let your brain in on what the rest of you is doing."
Are you two both clear on this?
"But if I can't use Eric's method, then how do I get a girl to say hi?"
- Cory...
- Yeah?
What did you know about girls before your brother's excellent advice?
- I didn't know anything.
- Why don't you just go with that?
"Um, ready to go?"
"Look, are you feeling a little funny about this?"
"You mean, about going out on a date?"
"Yeah, because we don't even know each other."
A little funny.
"So do you wanna, like, not go out on a date?"
"- Yeah, it doesn't feel right."
- I understand.
But we should still get to know each other.
"Oh, that would be nice."
"Yeah, because then, in case we ever did want to go out, well, we'd know each other."
"So, um, how do you want to get to know each other?"
"Well, we could go somewhere and talk..."
if you don't have something else to do.
"Well, I did, but, um..."
now I'm suddenly free.
Great.
-Yeah?
-Progress report.
Excuse me?
Progress report?
"No, ""Hello, how are you?"""
"Jesus, Claudia, you're really warming me up."

"Your commerce is so far up my ass, I can't sit up."
"Listen, the Age of Aquarius never happened, okay?"
-Get real.
This is commerce.
-I want to tell you something for your soul.
Pushing for Christmas and radio play will only amount to shit and wrapping paper.
"I don't know what happened, Jane."
We really used to be on the same page.
"I don't know what happened either, Claudia."
I guess you started exercising.
Gotta go.
Bitch.

Can we just say how lovely Jane looks today?
Can we just have a moment of appreciation for our sweet lovely Jane?
Jane rocks.

I had a math teacher in high school who was sort of my mentor.
"You know, I was one of those science geeks and my mother wasn't really around."
"So he took me under his wing, and he convinced me that I should be a doctor."

"Which is fine, unless it's been raining, and then some of them smell a bit damp."
"I think it's cough drops, tobacco and paraffin."
That's right.
And that's only the women!
I see you're still selling things unwrapped.
"That's a vicious rumour, madam."
I've never even appeared in the shop unwrapped!
"Mind you, they do look tempting."
I might have risked a couple if you'd had tongs.
-
- Don't you use tongs?
-
- Of course we do.
I am notorious on the tongs.
But usually I just save them for the summer months because they are marvellous instruments for swatting flies.
All right.
Easy.
I'm Jack Kang.
I'm leadership here.
"Yeah, we know who you are."
And we're not a threat to Candor.
That might be your truth.
It's not necessarily mine.
All I know for certain is you're both wanted for criminal insurgency and conspiring in the attack on Abnegation.
Those are lies.
"If you were Candor, I would take you at your word."
"Unfortunately, given the circumstances,"
I'm obliged to hand you over to the Council.
You can make your case there.
You might as well just kill us now.
"If Jeanine finds us, we're not gonna live to stand trial."
I doubt that very much.
She would never supersede the Council.
Sure about that?
Who's gonna stop her?
You?
Factional law must be upheld.
"All right, wait, wait, wait."
Can I ask you one question?
(GRUNTS)
Can I ask you one question?
Jeanine believes that Erudite are most fit to govern because they are the smartest.
Do you believe that Candor is most fit to judge because you're so honest?
I admit I do hold that belief.
Then would you say that a trial held here at Candor would be inherently more fair than a trial held by Erudite?
Hmm.
The answer is yes.
Where?
You can't defend him on this.
Where is he?
I don't know.
"I found this in the corner, under a shelf there."
"200 quid, stuffed in an old biscuit tin."
And here... shoe marks... size and pattern of which seem a good match for Julie-Ann's boots.
How far from here to where her body was found?
300-400 yards.
Possible she was dragged all that way?
Possible.
This could be where she was strangled.
That money you found at the lock-up matches the notes Julie-Ann stole from her dad.
"Well, we know she was doing a deal with O'Duncie."
"After she left the squat, she needed a secure location to stash the money until the deal was in place."
So she gave it to David to hang on to?
But why did he turn the garage upside-down?
He'd know where it was.
- To destroy the crime scene?
- She's nervous.
"O'Duncie has already beaten up Eddie, so she's not gonna trust anyone with £200, and doesn't tell David where she's hidden it."
"Then on the 13th, David Bentley wants to know where the money is."
And ends up throttling her.
- We've found the Bentley van.
"- Yes, sarge."
Let's go.
Sarge.
The list of Bentley associates and their last-known addresses.
- You sent cars out?
- Sergeant Harris thought you'd coordinate.

Wickes is lying low for a reason.

You.

Your surveillance pictures weren't good enough?
"By the way, bad of me."
"Well, that's not the kind of Kodak moment I was thinking."
(laughs)
He was just little when he gave it to me.
He used to love boats almost as much as you do.
"He said it was the two of us, and that we were on this boat, sailing away, happy."
He wanted to take you away.

But it can be one of the most difficult conditions to diagnose.
"And if the patient is in complete denial or lying to me, not only can I not tell, but I cannot hold her."
I gave her every opportunity to let us know.
I'm sorry.
- Need a hand?
- I need eight.
"Oh, God, it hurts!"
What's this?

The guy ran out in front of me.
"Please, give me something."

And we're out of beds.
"Okay, let's park him."
I'll see what I can do.
"Dr. Weaver, Psych's refusing to admit Judy Anderson."
Psych?
I believe her condition was a deliberate act.
"Yes, I know you suspect postpartum depression,"

- Practically.
She drove head-on into a wall.
The baby's seat wasn't properly anchored.
She's obviously overwhelmed at home.

Mother needs a new dress for the exercises.
Could I make some arrangement to buy her one?
After I graduate I'll get a job and I could pay you back.
You'll be needing a new dress yourself.
I can get by.
"Look, with Easter and graduation coming on, I'll be needing some help."
Would you like to work afternoons and Saturdays?

"The Underground's not a bar, it's more of a..."
Booze can for blood sucking wannabees?
"A sanctuary for children of the night, where they can congregate."
At nine dollars a drink.
I thought you said she was open to those who choose to live alternative lifestyles.
She is.
You are.
Believe me.
"Okay, here's the part I don't understand."
"If he died in the alley, what exactly do you want me to investigate?"
I have enough problems with the city already.
I don't need them trying to blame Dante's death on me.
Is there any reason to believe your establishment might be connected to his death?
My customers are like my children.
"I nurture them, like Coreen...my favorite."
The most spiritual of the night breed.
Okay I'll take the case.
- My fee is...
[exclaims]
Potted plant would be less trouble.
The way she's been carrying on.
"Since the separation, not even divorced, mind you."
Running around with lounge lizards like that Mr. de Mario.
"He was the one that took her out last night, before she was killed."
Listen... do you think that de Mario did it?
Who knows?
Gives me the creeps.
"He's the slippery type, you know."
"Well, why not him?"
"Listen, he brings her home, see."
They've been drinking maybe.
Then she asks him to drive you home to get rid of him.
"But he fools her, he comes back."
"Did act kind of peculiar in the car, coming home."
"Never opened his mouth once, except to say good night."
"That was kind of funny, wasn't it?"
Yeah.
"Well, as I say, anybody could've done it."
They say when they found her strangled--
I don't even wanna think about that.
She was never any good.
"Even right from the beginning, when I first started sitting for the Nashes."
Long before they were separated.
(Lottie) I remember one night.
They were supposed to go to his boss's house for dinner.
So I got there at 7.:00 like I was supposed to.
Mrs. Nash was picking on Mr. Nash something awful.
It wasn't as if I was snooping or anything.
"She must've known I was standing there, but that didn't stop her."
Not for one minute.
- and I'll never forget...
"- Excuse me, miss?"
Miss?
"- Yes, sir?"
- What's this?
"Three Plantation Dogs, an Uncle Tom Turkey Platter,"
"White Meat Supreme, Two Clucks Clams..."
"Okay, you charged us for eight drinks."
There's only five of us.
- Refills are free.
"- Oh, yes, they used to be, but we changed our policy a few years back."
"Well, I wasn't notified."
You should've put that in writing.
"Oh, we did, sir."
"It's on the wall, on the table, and from what I've been told, it's facing you when you use the urinal."
"Well, I didn't come here to read, I came here to eat!"
"Now, take these off of my check, you bunch of chiselers!"
"Oh, oh, oh."
I understand.
"If you're having a difficult time right now, we have an ""indigent can."""
It's near the register.
- I'm no charity case.
"- Oh, of course not, you're a human being."
"But between you and me, we throw the extra food in the trash every night, so if you get here before midnight, you won't have to fight the other vagrants for it."
"Daddy, do we have to eat garbage?"
"Nobody's eating garbage, princess!"
"Now, let me tell you something, lady..."
How dare you insinuate my husband can't pay!
"- Sue, butt out."
- He can pay for this!
- I can?
- Open your wallet.
what is that?
- A really good movie?
- that's a tabloid tv show.
Come on. seriously£¬guys. she can't keep getting away with this.
we all just have to band together and take her down.
Serena we just graduated. gossip girl high school
All these people backbiting and conniving--
Don't you think we should be moving on with our lives?
Well high school's over
But--but they're still my friends. you're still my friend.
Yeah.
What you--you don't think so?
No no i do but honestly...
School's finished
And our parents...
That--that doesn't really look great.
Next year we're gonna be in different cities.
And when you think about it
What's really keeping us together?
So that's it?
You--you get your diploma and you're just moving on?
Well congratulations dan.
Have--have a good life.
So... doughnuts?
No let's just go home.
- I want to--i want to get out of this suit. - all right.
The number of posts in the last six months about constance and st. jude's is more than double
Of the next mentioned school.
number one on our hit list
Would seem to indicate a personal connection.
And i refuse to believe the students at our school are
Any worse than those at horace mann or spence.
Prison?
"Oh, God, don't even say that word."
"Honey, it's okay."
"I know it's going to be okay, really."
How does everything change in a day?
"It's probably just business stuff, you know?"
Cutting corners and inspectors.
Remember Daddy used to bribe inspectors.
He did not.
He left an envelope of $20 bills in the kitchen so they could take it.
He did?
But his kitchen was unbelievably clean.
You have to pay in order to stay in business.
You think that's what Rick did?
How do I know?
"But it's a pretty big project, so who knows how many people might want a piece?"
Don't worry. I hear those white-collar prisons are okay.
They play golf with millionaires.
Municipal waiting rooms can be so dreary.
- l thought you'd left town.
- Why would I do that?
Why haven't you returned my calls?
- To protect the innocent.
- And who does that include?
Whomever you want it to.
"All right, look, do you understand how much I have riding here?"
"My career, my whole life?"
"This is scary. lt's really scary for me, Miles, and I need to ask you, do I have anything to worry about?"
Did you do anything wrong?
"All right, look, the second permit for the high-rise, it was supposed..."
"Shh, shh."
[ classical music playing] lt was supposed to take six weeks.
What was it that you asked me?
"Well, sir, it was only what you said about being fixed up with an alibi."
"I mean, did he have a reason to?"
"Lieutenant, would you mind speaking clearly?"
Did who have a reason to do what?
"Make an alibi, sir, your friend."
"I mean, were you watching the ballgame at ten minutes to nine, sir, with him?"
"Oh, I see."
Well...
"Yes, I suppose I was."
"I don't have an exact memory about time, that's why I have Mark."
"And if he says I was, I was."
He's very responsible about time.
That's what makes him a superior gofer.
"You think she was murdered, don't you?"
"I beg your pardon, sir?"
You heard me.
"Yes, sir, I did."
I mean...
"Yes, I do think it was a premeditated killing, sir."
"I mean, I think the robbery was staged to cover-up the murder."
"How did you know, sir?"
Why else would you be here?
"It could be just a routine check, sir."
"No, Lieutenant."
"They don't send a police detective stumbling around asking silly, fake-innocent questions on a routine check."
I know that from my show.
"Well, silly, fake-innocent questions like what, sir?"
(CHUCKLES)
"Like, ""Mr. Daley wasrt at home last night."
"""He wasrt there this morning."
They told me at the office.
- Are you trying to shut down my performance?
"- You may have your event, if after the performance, you give up the girl."
- That's ridiculous.
- You've grown too attached.
The society has decided that they will do with Isabel as they see fit.
It's time for her to be placed.
- I refuse.
- I thought all these characters...
I thought it was part of my therapy.
"But then I started having all these dreams, and some of them turned out to be real, like..."
like... like hurting you and and Roderick.
I don't know what happened to Roderick.
He did this to me.
They need to be punished.
But how?
- Gunther.
"- You should go back to your room, Mary."
- You fill the goblets for the society rituals?
"Please, help us, Gunther."
- Thank you.
"- There's something you should know, ma'am, about one of the men who's judging you tonight."
"Look for the one that says ""wolf's bane."""
- This?
- Yes.
"- Hide, hide, hide."
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.
End this.
- Why are you in here?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Is the disgusting... repulsive little urchin sampling my wares?
Which I don't really have.
"So, what I'm trying to say is that I really, really need this scholarship."
Did you rehearse that?
Yeah.
"Like, 14 times in front of the mirror."
"Unfortunately, desire doesn't figure into this much."
The Robinson is going to go to someone who dazzles.
Somebody who just jumps off the page.
"Oh, well, then, I'm also involved in a science competition."
We're building a robotic wheel that can navigate itself using a proprietary GPS system.
"Well, I'm designing the system."
So...
Right.
"Ben, last year, the Robinson went to Hyum Jae Wook, a Korean immigrant who has only one leg."
"Well, I have both my legs."
"Well, have you considered cutting one of them off?"
That was a joke.
"Ben, it's all about the essay."
You need to really explain to us what makes you special.
What life experience separates you from all the rest.
Life experience.
"What can you tell me, Ben, that's going to dazzle me?"
I'm so sorry I'm late.
- Where is your jacket?
"- Oh, I got it."
I got it.
It's right here.
This is no way for the new assistant manager to come to work.
Congratulations.
How does $8 an hour sound?
Eight dollars?
Wow!
"Brah, we don't have a few hours."
"If we don't find this guy by the end of this feed, this girl is as good as dead."
"Yeah, enough with the pressure, man."
And I haven't even smoked my morning bowl yet.
ADDISON:
The truth is
I haven't been honest about who I am and the mistakes that I have made.
And now I'm going to confess.
We're running out of time.
Five years ago in Pl... (playing upbeat song)
What the hell just happened?
She just got played off by Fatso the Keyboard Cat.
Somebody deliberately knocked that feed offline.
And that someone was me.
"Toast, what are you doing?"
I'm getting you your location the only way I know how.
Holm can't reestablish a connection without exposing his location.
It's genius.
And what if he just decides to kill this girl?
What then?
Then I guess I'll look pretty dumb.
This doesn't change anything.
"When that light goes back on, you say exactly what I told you to."
It worked.
He took the bait.
Not so fast.
I still have to zero in on his location.
How long?
"17 seconds, give or take."
ADDISON:
This is my confession.
"Five years ago in Plymouth, Minnesota I was driving my car late at night... when I struck a pedestrian, killing him instantly."
-Hiram?
Great.
What is he?
An assistant librarian with little pince-nez glasses and a nervous twitch?
"God, I never realised you had such a fertile imagination."
"Well, what was I supposed to say?"
That I came around to break the news to you our relationship was over?
-He'd have gone potty.
-What relationship?
-We never had a relationship.
"-Okay, look, we got to make a move, sweetheart."
"Mick says he can help shift my stuff back today if we get there by 3:00, so...."
"Oh, yeah, the other thing, Gil, and it's bit of an odd one."
"My mother, you know she's in this nursing home now in Lower Ledbury, and maybe the old marbles are starting to go or what I don't know, I mean, she's 81 ."
But all she kept saying when I was there yesterday is how much she wanted to see you.
Me?
Are you joking?
Why would she want to see me?
I don't think I've ever even met the lady.
"Well, I said I'd pass it on."
"Anyway, look, we'll see you around, okay?"
"And, you know, I really hope it works out for Hiram."
Right.
Thank you.
-What is it?
You're not ill or anything?
"-No, it's nothing like that."
No.
"Well, then listen, if you've got your health,"
"I tell you, there is nothing else in life worth getting that upset about."
"So, come on, you can share it with me."
What's the problem?
You happy?
-I've seen it.
-Ah.
One last time.
You can think of some priest who fits the bill?
-Come on.
"-No, answer the question, Father Paranoia."
All right.
All right.
-You know who I think really did it?
-Who?
The Dominicans.
Go pick on them.
"I could have you deported, you know that?"
I lied.
You look like Sal Mineo.
"It looks like a type of disorder that's, uh, rarely ever seen anymore except in primitive cultures."
"We call it, uh, somnambular-form possession."
"Quite frankly, we really don't know much about it at all except that it starts with a conflict or a guilt and it leads to the patient's delusions that his body has been invaded by some alien intelligence."
Um....
"A spirit, if you will."
"Look, I'm telling you again, and you'd better believe me I am not going to lock her up in some goddamn asylum."
"-Well, it's out of--"
-And I don't care what you call it.
I'm not putting her away.
"Well, I'm sorry."
You're sorry?
Jesus Christ!
"Eighty-eight doctors, and all you can tell me with all your bullshit is...."
"Of course, there is one outside chance for a cure."
"But, um, I think of it as a shock treatment."
"As I said, it's a very outside chance--"
Excellent.
"You look relieved, Father."
That was the toughest yet.
Thanks for the steer.
"Anything for a peaceful life, eh?"
Partners in crime.
Who'd have thought it?
"You know what, when those two get together, they really are a deadly combination."
Of course the real reason we won is because I knew exactly which blooms Father Brown favoured.
What rot!
"If I hadn't been to finishing school, the whole thing would have been an unmitigated disaster!"
"Excuse me, we're looking for the deli counter."
Certainly.
Turn left at Lighting and it's just past Ladies Wear.
"Nice one, ta."
We should leave.
People are giving us some pretty dirty looks.
"No, we fit right in, man!"
"Sure, we might not be cash rich, but it's obvious we're classy guys."
"Here we go, the taster counter."
"Get stuck in, it's free."
"Yep, really classy."
"If you load up, you can taste a full meal."
"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
"We're just browsing, thanks."
And eating.
I'm browsing with my mouth.
Just having a little taste - try before you buy.
And are you planning to buy that chicken leg?
"Probably not now, to be honest."
We're sorry about this.
"Hey, look."
It's Yo-Yo.
Let's get out of here.
Come on.
"Hey, Yo-Yo."
Don't you want to catch us?
I don't trust him.
He's probably using some psychology trick on us.
Come on.
"Hey, Mr. Yo-yo, don't you want to catch us?"
It's not my job anymore.
They're coming down to fire me for destroying city property.
The only thing that works is the radio.
And it won't turn off.
"I was only trying to help you, kids."
"Mr. Yokomoto,"
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
"All I ever wanted in life was all you kids that I put back in school, someday visit me and say,"
"""thanks Mr. Yo-Yo, Yokomoto."
"If it wasn't for you forcing us to get an education,"
"We would've been bums."""
That's all I wanted.
You see?
I told you he was gonna hit us with some of that heavy psychology.
"I mean, I feel guilty."
Bulletin from the plutonium plant.
"Unless the demands of the terrorists are met, the furnace will explode with the force of ten megatons."
"An official describes the atomic furnace controls as frozen in position,"
"- As if ""the molecular flow..."""
- That's Tony!
- The plant is being evacuated.
- That's where he is!
Come on outside with me and let blanche finish dressing.
-I'm finished dressing.
-Then come on out.
-Your sister and I are having a talk.
-Honey run to the drugstore and get me a lemon Coke with chipped ice.
"will you do that for me, sweetie, please?"
please.
AII right.
Poor thing was out there listening to us.
And I have an idea she doesn't understand you as well as I do.
"AII right now, Mr. KowaIski, Iet us proceed without any more digression."
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I have nothing to hide.
What is it?
In the state of Louisiana we got here what's known as the napoleonic Code.
"According to which, what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband and vice versa."
"My, but you have an impressive judicial air."
"You know, if I didn't know that you was my wife's sister, I would get ideas about you."
-Such as what?
-Don't play so dumb.
You know what.
AII right.
Cards on the table.
I know I fib a good deal.
"After all, a woman's charm is 50 percent illusion."
But when a thing is important I tell the truth.
And this is the truth:
"I never cheated my sister, or you, or anyone else on earth as long as I lived."
"-Where are the papers, in your trunk?"
-Everything I own is in that trunk.
What are you thinking of?
What's in the back of that little boy's mind of yours?
I have to talk to you.
I'm in trouble.
My wife arrives tomorrow.
Aren't you happy?
"Sure, but I lied to her about my Iife here."
"I tried to tell herthe truth, but she didn't believe me, so I let herbeIieve what she wanted."
I told herit's awful here.
"The more she thinks I'm suffering, the nicer she treats me, ourreIationship has improved and she's better."
I'm not sure I got it.
She's betterif you're worse?
"It sounds strange, but that's it."
What did you tell her?
.
I didn't get that.
"Stereotypes, more orless."
Untrue things they say up North.
Like you're somewhat basic.
"SimpIetons, dull, that you gesture, you can't be understood, you're a bit vulgar."
"Maybe I used the terms dirty, violent, shitkickers."
- Shitkickers?
- I did it forIove.
ForherI was a hero facing life courageously.
Don't abandon me.
I didn't even want to come here.
I was sent because I faked being handicapped!
"My friends, I did it forher!"
"His book is on the night table, he's at page 11, he has to reach page 26, then he can sleep."
He has to brush his teeth for at Ieast one minute.
"That's the humidifier, and not too much perfume, it dries the boy's mucous membranes, he'II lose his sense of smell, as an adult he won't smell a gas leak."
I'II go get the bag of medicines.
"Mommy, I'm scared of Grandma and Grandpa!"
What's this smell?
"Yes, Operation Sunshine, the protection of power and dam installations in Southern Norway, to prevent the Germans from destroying too much before they surrender."
You've been chosen to lead the operation with Parson as second in command and Skinnarland on radio duties.
The rest of the group you pick yourself.
Congratulations.
I thought this was what you always wanted.
"To go back to Norway, get out into the field again?"
"If you'd rather stay here just until the end of hostilities and then go and see your wife and children, it's no problem, I can..."
Of course not.
The war's not over yet.
"Thank you, sir."
Good man.
"Well, you're certainly not going to miss the fish."
You don't get fishes like this in Norway.
"Not really, no."
Eugh!
I can't.
It must be very beautiful this time of year.
It's always beautiful.
Do you know what I miss the most about Norway?
"The horizons, wherever you look."
Yeah.
It's been a while.
You must come and visit.
My house is big.
"Well, that could be awkward."
"I might go back to university, do another degree."
That's a good idea.
This country needs good bird-watchers.
It certainly does.
It's going to be strange not to have a war.
Yes.
What else to it?
- Crusoe.
Robinson crusoe.
"stay right there, mr."
Crusoe.
Don't move an inch.
Why?
I said don't move!
You expect me to stand here while you try and shoot me?
So you can keep your secret and carry on living a lie?
Only so I can carry on living.
"Listen, I wish you no harm."
Then why were you spying on me.
I wasn't spying on you.
"I came to ask for your help, but you--"
This changes things.
I'm sorry I startled you.
"If you're in need of medical help, then my sex would be of no issue."
Are you planning something?
"Like I said, this changes things."
You don't trust me because I'm a woman?
I serve jacob moore because I'd be killed if I didn'T.
I do what I can for captain taylor because I have no wish to end up on the end of a rope should he regain command.
Self-preservation to the last.
"You're a castaway stranded on this island, mr."
Crusoe.
We're all slaves to self-preservation.
Takes courage to live as I do.
More than if I were a man.
I'll find another way.
What if I tell the mutineers you're out here?
And what if I tell them that you're a woman?
Whose life would become more unbearable then?
You look lovely when you're angry.
Stop it!
I'll love you... if you want.
"Oh, yeah?"
But don't boss me around.
I don't want to boss you around.
"Then love me for a change, and stop annoying me."
Then love me for a change.
Sometimes you're so...
"Oh, no!"
Why did you go to that movie?
"Well, I think we're even now."
Bye.
I've finished work.
Nervous... arrogant... vain... unkempt... unhealthy... self-satisfied... full of longing... spent...
- strange.
- Full of longing?
- That annoys you.
"- No, arrogant annoys me."
- And self-satisfied and vain.
- Yeah.
It's your turn.
Reserved... frustrated... inhibited... hesitant... closed-up... pulled together... egocentric... not hungry.
You don't want anything to eat?
- Why egocentric?
- I don't know.
- Why do you think I'm strange?
- Because you are.
- You're not egocentric?
- I don't know.
"Sorry, I actually ordered tea."
"Stupid, ugly, idiotic, blind, deaf, mute, moronic!"
"Although in an indifferent universe there's no room for tragedy, is there?"
You've been reading something more than women's magazines.
You made him swallow his own words.
Doctor Alexander...
It's all right.
I came in to help solve these atrocious crimes.
"Yes, if you could take the DNA sample, Doctor Alexander."
"Thank you, Mr Fordyce."
If you would just open your mouth.
"Tom, you saw how he reacted, how he shifted when you mentioned the article."
His whole antagonism to Dave Stubbs' beliefs.
It's not enough.
You can't charge a man because he believes in nothing.
Tom?
"God, what's wrong with you?"
It's the chemo.
Chemo?
I have cancer.
What do you mean?
What sort of cancer?
The sort that kills you quickly.
Why didn't you tell me?
"Well, I didn't think it was relevant."
"Tom, you have cancer."
That is relevant.
What's the prognosis?
80-20 against me surviving the year.
"They never really know, people do de_ these predictions."
Let's hope.
Can we change the subject?
Shouldn't you be making the most of your life instead of chasing after murderers?
"Well, I figured if I kept busy, it might just go away."
Pass!
Come here.
Why did you go alone?
Why didn't you pass?
But I...
"Don't ""but"" me!"
playing the game is a team responsibility.
Responsibility?
"Well, I definitely see how something could have slipped out of there."
Absolutely.
That would have fallen right out in the middle of the bed.
What about Charlie's hole?
"Just get into the bed, please, and show us how you sleep, guys."
"Well, right off the bat, I think there's a clear solution could have prevented this entire thing."
You guys need to get two beds.
"Oh, maybe I'll get two TVs and two refrigerators."
What are you talking about?
Do we come to your house and tell you how to sleep?
I sleep in a king-sized bed by myself.
"When I have to go to the bathroom, I use a toilet."
Look at...
He...
Dennis on his bed made for kings with his toilet made out of gold.
"Okay, guys, everybody calm down, please."
This is not about lifestyle.
This is not about judgments.
"This is about truth, okay?"
"Now, Charlie and Frank, show us how you were positioned the night of the incident."
Excuse me.
Incidents.
"All right, well, I'm pretty sure I was sleeping like this that night."
"It's just, like, no way it could have been me."
Are you two going to be able to work together?
"No, I don't take that shit personally."
But I can't say the same for sleeping beauty.
God knows he could tell anybody anything.
It was his drive to find his wife that led us to McCarthy.
Perhaps he can still be of some use.
And if he's not?
Well... we pull the plug.
Latest SAT intel has Karp running planes from a dirt strip in Northern Mexico.
"No, we know where Karp is, and his entire family for that matter."
That's never been the issue.
"We just confirmed, Karp's working with the Hunters."
Karp also has ongoing dealings with the CIA.
- He's protected.
- I don't want Karp.
I want the bitch he answers to.
- Your mother.
- She knows more than my dad ever could.
That's whose fingernails you should be pulling out with pliers.
You did well with your father.
You gained more in ten minutes than we have in years.
You hurt him again and I will tear your throat out.
"Careful, Agent Regan."
Threatening a superior officer is cause for immediate dismissal.
You won't.
You need me and you know it.
Let me go to Mexico.
I go through Karp to get my mom and I bring her back.
"In exchange, you release my dad."
I don't feel anything.
"The scute protein's solution's tricky, but I think I'm making progress."
You think?
- I'm sorry.
I didn't think you were serious.
- At least you get letters.
"- Oh sure, Lily."
Most of the poets that come in here don't even want to see my face when they fuck me.
"- Rule number one is to make them cum, right?"
"They come in five minutes, they owe you for half an hour."
- Good.
What else?
"- Ah, but a professional always offer a massage, so the guy doesn't feel like a total loser."
- And
- it's the best way to get another half an hour out of the prick.
- That's my girl.
* And night falls on a weekend day
* And all the young and some old
* Come out to play
* And some of us drink to laugh
* Some of us drink to cry

* For a while
* And anywhere's better than here *
- When were you last employed?
"- Um, well, I, uh,"
I do volunteer work?
"- I'm sorry, perhaps I didn't make myself very clear."
"When did you last cease full-time, paid employment?"
"- Paid, um."
It's about two years ago.
"- Well, that's the reason why you're currently under review for your Newstart Allowance."
We just need to be making sure that you're still actively looking for work.
"- Yeah, I have been."
I have been.
This is where he hid his stash in 1954.
It's been waiting for him.
What are these guys thinking when they come back?
Were they all asleep?
Paint's still wet.
We just missed him.
Mines are the exact same size.
Why is he painting them?
"Sandstone paint, rubber tiles... oh, my God."
Playground turf.
They use it all over the city.
So the next target...
Could be any elementary school or park in San Francisco.
Whoever killed the security guard has got to be the same nut job planting land mines.
City gets a ransom note.
Some crazy Korean poem in it.
"Guys says give him $651,000 and change, and he'll tell us where the rest of the mines are."
- Pretty specific number.
- Yeah.
Wait.
"How is it that you caught up with this guy, but everybody else seems to be clueless?"
I got a secret weapon.
Who are you again?
Surprise me.
We found where Paxton Petty's been hiding his bombs.
And Petty?
He left a dead security man in his wake.
And we found playground turf and spray-paint.
"Now we don't know what the spray-paint means, but the turf..."
What color was the paint?
The turf means he's gonna hit up a school or a park.
We don't have enough information to narrow down the search 'cause there's too many of 'em.
"You can fix them, maybe, but it doesn't mean they didn't happen."
So don't go in there to that girl and try to sugarcoat it and pretend it's all better when it's not.
"Well, I should've seen it."
"You know, I could've stopped it."
You are not responsible for what that girl did any more than you're responsible for what happened to me.
"I'm sorry, Violet."
I'm sorry I didn't come sooner.
You came when you could.
"No, no."
"I'm sorry that I did not come sooner... before, with Katie."
You came when you could.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Mm.
"Shh, shh."
You're here now.
"So a bad thing happened, and I can't change that."
"And sometimes the things people say to try to make you feel better, they just come out sounding... stupid."
"So, um... you tell me what you need."
What if he dies?
"What if he dies, and I never get to tell him I'm sorry?"
"Nobody beat me, nobody tried to steal my baby, nobody stabbed me, but..."
"I am wounded, Sam."
Noah?
"Oh, my heart is broken."
And I shouldn't even complain about it because... nothing happened.
"I mean, nothing happened to me, not like what happened to the Larsens and Violet."
"You know, sometimes..."
I'm almost jealous of them?
"Because everybody can see their injuries, so they have a right to be messed up."
I sent noah back to his wife.
I did the right thing.
It's bad enough you let the guy go.
It wasn't a big deal.
"Assaulting a federal officer is always a big deal, and you know it."
The fact that you didn't arrest him tells me you're not thinking straight.
"Look, don't worry about me, King."
All right?
I'm fine.
Let's just get back to work.
"Sorry to interrupt, but we just got a lead on the stolen money."
"Yeah, I'm on it."
I don't see anything.
Where's the lead?
"Well, it's actually not my lead, so..."
"Took you long enough, Percy."
I don't exactly have all day.
"Yeah, sorry, something came up."
You called Gregorio.
E-mailed.
"And it was just some serial numbers, so this was all her choice."
"It's not a big deal, Pride."
"Well, actually it is."
"The bills came from a bank robbery in Biloxi, Mississippi, six weeks ago."
A teller slipped a dye pack into the money before the robbers took off.
Seems that makes our marine a bank robber.
Doesn't explain why Jared was stabbed or who'd want to kill him.
How many robbers in Biloxi?
"Witnesses said there were four, including a getaway driver, heavily armed, too."
SONJA:
"So, robbers turning against each other?"
What's going on?
"Oh, hey, Hannah."
Agent Pride.
"Look, Martha Dumptruck, revenge of the nerds, and hello kitty -- they rode the same bus."
"Okay, so maybe the bus is haunted."
"Well, that would explain why there's no EMF at the school, but not the attacks."
Ghosts are tied to the places that they haunt.
They can't just bail.
Unless this one can.
"Dean, there's lore about spirits possessing people and riding them for miles."
"Then whenever they leave the body, they're bungeed back to their usual haunt."
"But until then, the ghosts can go wherever they want."
So a spook just grabs a kid on the bus and walks right into Truman?
It's possible.
"Ghosts getting creative -- well, that's super."
Definitely ain't clean.
"Here, ghosty, ghosty, ghosty!"
"Come out, come out, wherever you are!"
"Man, I don't get it."
"No one ever died on this bus, and it's not like there's a body hidden in here."
"Yeah, but a flap of skin, a hair."
"I mean, hell, a hangnail."
Something's got to be tying the ghost to this place.
We just got to find it.
Yeah.
Got a new driving permit.
Issued two weeks ago.
- Just before the first attack.
- Yeah.
Name of the bus driver is Dirk McGregor sr.
39 North Central Avenue.
- McGregor?
- Yeah.
Why?
I knew his son.
"Sophie, I've been looking at color choices, and how would you feel about us in a nude?"
Max could go nude but you don't have the rack to pull it off.
Does anyone have a knife?
"Max, why do you have a switchblade to work in a dessert bar?"
My mother always told me to carry protection.
Wait 'til you see Grandma Kuchenski's dress.
They don't make them like they used to.
"You know, forced gypsy labor is illegal now."
Here we go.
- Oh.
- Uh...
"Sophie, was your grandma the Crypt Keeper?"
What's going on out here?
What's all that white powder in the air?
"I'm trying to run a restaurant, not an 80's disco."
"Oh, put a sock in it."
I'm buying one of your freaking overpriced puddings.
I'd get mad but I'm mildly attracted to you right now.
Just mildly?
"I mean, now I'm getting mad."
Sorry.
Wedding drama.
Her dress just fell completely to pieces... like I'm assuming I'll do in the near future.
"Whatever you need anything bridal, go to Rosenfeld's in Brooklyn."
That's where I got my dress when I was broke and straight.
So you weren't always into women?
Of course I was.
Except those three years in Scientology.
"Well, it looks like the three of us are going to go dress shopping now."
Yeah.
"And you know, I got to go wash my hands 'cause they're covered in old lady DNA."
"Well, that's that."
Now!
Shoot a propane tank and you'll just get a big cloud of cold gas.
You need an open flame and real good aim.
Get down!
"Yeah, Sam, I had to drive around, make sure we weren't followed."
She could be anywhere now.
Gotta go.
- What's happening?
- We'll get to that.
"- For now, I need to know why someone wants you dead."
- It's a long story.
"Well, that's a long story that starts with Greenway Cargo, right?"
- Give me the short version for now.
- I was the controller.
"Uh, mostly wrote checks, did invoices."
It was a job.
I've been a C.P.A. for 15 years.
- Need to get to the marked for death part.
- After a while...
I realized I was paying vendors I'd never heard of... for cargo that was never delivered.
- Front companies.
"- They were into all kinds of stuff- weapons, ivory, human cargo."
Th-That's what the F.B.I. said.
"Anyway, they came to my house, said they were investigating the company, investigating me."
- Unless you testify.
"- I didn't want to get involved, but they said I'd go to jail."
I said I'd think about it.
Then- things started happening.
- Things?
What things?
"- I had people following me... phone calls, guys watching my house."
Then my wife... goes out in my car.
- What are you looking for?
"- Her apartment is $2,500 a month."
"I lose $1,000 a night, every night that she does not work for me."
"I'm not paying you 1,000 a night."
Get real.
But something.
I need something.
I have expenses.
I'm not losing money.
Call me tomorrow.
I'll see what I have in the budget.
Watch yourself.
You're walking a very thin line.
"You, too."
I know what you get from my girls.
"Maybe this DEA guy, or whoever he is, is connected to these Americans."
You seriously think there's a conspiracy to take Jim out... so the American can take the drug trade over?
It's a $6 billion a year business.
"It's right in their backyard, which they can take a big piece of, by one simple move, getting rid of Jim."
I think you're smoking too much of what we're selling.
You always think everything is connected to everything else.
"'Cause that's how it really is, Ron."
Everything is connected.
It's coincidence.
"Random incidents, they come together, they line up so suddenly it looks like a pattern or a conspiracy."
- But it's just random.
- Just hear me out.
"Jim is the glue, he holds all these little pieces together."
"He leaves, there a big hole in the trade here."
What's that?
It's random.
It's a perfect storm and we're in the eye of it.
- Thank you.
And I also noticed a certain linguistic similarity with Bennet's recent work.
Well...
- That's...
"- Carrie, I'm not an idiot."
I know you wrote the parachute pants piece for him.
I just...
I really wanted to help Bennet out.
Stop worrying about Bennet.
Think about yourself.
Because this piece is going in the magazine under your name.
Mouse!
Have you seen Pete?
"Uh, no."
I thoughouyou guys were hanging out today.
"Well, we were supposed to."
"And then this morning, he called while I was out and told me my mom that he's leaving tonight."
And now I can't find him anywhere.
"Okay, don't panic."
I'm sure he'll show up sooner or later.
Why'd I let you convince me to scare him off with my onion breath and my hairy legs?
"We were just trying to help, so you wouldn't make the same mistakes you kept making in the past."
"Great, well, now you helped me right out of a boyfriend."
"It's not too late, you know, to make your own mistakes."
How would I do that?
"Well, he took the bus here, right?"
So go down to the bus station and wait for him there.
And tell him what?
Whatever your instincts tell you to say.
"Oh, God."
That's probably my dad.
"Hey, Bennet."
- You went home with that guy?
"- Uh, is that fair?"
- Did you sleep with him?
That's all I want to know.
"Uh, you don't actually want to know."
I was gonna talk to Michelle.
I was gonna...
You know what?
Forget it.
- What?
Chad!
Don't...
"- Don't call me, all right?"
Oh.
So last night was about making someone else jealous.
- I don't know.
"- Well, it obviously worked."
You almost have to love the irony.
You're where I was a few months ago.
"You ended things with me, Scotty."
Now you know how hard it is to love someone who doesn't love himself.
I feel sorry for you.
"Good luck, Kevin."
It's just a travesty.
"I mean, what has this city come to when the police are arresting two little old... two mature women, and throwing them in jail for the night?"
Maybe if you had shown some maturity and not resisted arrest...
I never resisted...
No one ever re...
Wouldn't my tax dollars be better spent arresting drug dealers or bangers?
Gang bangers.
Maybe you shouldn't be so judgmental now that you have a record.
Any chance of you not telling your siblings about this?
I say that even now.
But how did you remember all this?
I'm caught.
It was a lie.
Coming to Malaysia for your treatment?
A naked lie.
You made us fools?
"You're right, that was true."
I hate people who act like you.
Aren't you acting?
"Though I am in your heart, you're getting ready to get engaged with someone else."
Isn't that an act?
I acted saying that I don't remember past.
And you are acting without saying that.
Not much of a difference.
Happy moments I spent with you are more important for me.
You think of our separation.
You forget things which you should remember.
Don't cheat yourself.
Is she telling me to go away?
Is she telling me to come?
What is your heart saying?
Do you know that at least?
You storm me like a tornado...
I suffocate because of you...
In such circumstances...
Is it possible to know what my heart says?
Roaring forever...
The clouds won't hide the water vapour and carry that burden...
"Like you, it won't hide its love..."
If you had embraced me with your warmth... my youth would have jumped in joy...
If you had struck the right notes...
"Hey, you think if I keep telling myself it's over,"
I'll actually believe it?
You'll be sorry if it's over.
No more running around crazy in the streets with roguishly handsome me.
Have you always found yourself so entertaining?
Come on.
Admit it.
I amuse the stuffing out of you.
My stuffing's perfectly in place.
You know what I'll miss?
Knowing what's gonna happen.
It made me feel... godlike.
That's nothing new for you.
"Well, I, guess I'll see you next time the universe decides to break all its rules on your behalf."
"Yeah, next time."
Goodbye.
Nico.
Yeah?
What did the guy do?
What guy?
"On the video, the one that got you kicked off the force?"
"In the modern world, there's nowhere to hide, is there?"
- I'm sorry.
I shouldn't...
- It was a meth factory... in a house in El Sobrante.
Guy just... escaped a cooking accident.
Place went up in a fireball.
Too bad his girlfriend and kid that he left behind did not survive the inferno.
Too bad for my career with the police department
I let my... my disapproval of his behavior get the better of me.
"If it were me, I wouldn't have been kicked off the force for assaulting him."
- No?
Tony's.
"You know Tony, sir."
He's the one who...
"If you tell me that one more time, I'm gonna kill myself."
"Sorry, sir."
Have I said that before?
"So the number of people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night,"
"her secretary,"
"Mr. Sid Daley,"
Mark...
I'm curious as to how Mark knew.
"Well, sir, Mark offered to bring her a cheeseburger and she told her secretary to tell him that she not only didn't want a gofer, she didn't want a cheeseburger, either."
And that she was going to get a sandwich over at Tony's.
And she said to tell her husband the same thing.
I see.
"Well, no you don't, sir."
"I mean, you must have seen before."
"Because you were in the room when she took the call, werert you?"
She made it from this dressing room.
I don't know.
I'm not sure.
I'm not in the habit of listening to other people's telephone calls.
I didn't know that Claire was going to Tony's.
"You didn't, sir?"
"Absolutely not, Lieutenant."
"Then how did you know, sir, that there were only four people who knew where Claire Daley was going to be that night and how did you know that you were one of them?"
The same way you did.
I asked Claire's secretary and she informed me that the call was made from my room.
"You did, sir?"
"Oh, yes, I did, Lieutenant."
"Oh, that's very good, sir."
"Thank you, Lieutenant."
"Yeah, you want to grab One of those samples, sam?"
Yeah.
Zeke tenhoff and his brother sam.
"Are assessing the fruits Of their day's labor,"
As they work to secure A mineralrights.
Claim on the grounds.
With the state of alaska.
"Yeah, this is the sample That was from, like,"
Far away from the hole As I could get.
My immediate goal For the start of this ice season.
Is to collect enough samples To be able to prove.
That there is A longterm resource of gold.
Out at that prehistoric Beach line at hastings creek.
"Once I have that data, I can start."
"The claiming And leasing process,"
To have unrestricted access To the area for the longterm.
"I hate to be the pessimist,"
But this just looks like A bucket full of sand to me.
I do kinda wish maybe I was Panning from samples.
"That were full of red And black sand,"
Instead of just old Prehistoric pebbles.
It's in here.
I mean...
Okay.
We got one tiny little speck.
It's right there.
Speck of gold.
Tiny little speck of fine gold.
That's not gonna Pay the bills.
It's not gonna pay the bills.
"The first samples that I was Able to take, not looking good."
"I mean, by brother's not happy."
"man, all that conversation."
People writing notes.
"They look at you different, like, trying to figure out who you really are."
Like you're famous.
Admit it. lt's really great.
I don't know what you are talking about.
"Come in, gentlemen."
"So, M r."
Krakow?
I thought a lot about what you said.
And I decided that the main thing is really to protect the school.
"That's good, Brian."
I went to the bathroom.
I heard a scuffle.
Then a shot. I came out.
I saw two pairs of legs running in opposite directions.
Who those people were I can't say.
And if you or these men or anybody else threatens me anymore...
pressures me anymore--
Brian-- l will insist on having a lawyer...
and I will sue you for harassment and anything else I can.
And if you try to expel me in order to solve your public relations problems...
then I will reveal to anyone who will listen...
just who is destroying the spirit of this school.
"So, they still haven't found out who had the gun."
"Mom, it's really okay."
Let it go.
The school hasn't self destructed yet.
It's just so hard not being able to protect you.
"Yeah, but you can't."
"- Hey, what's up?"
- Hey everybody.
He tried to grab her in front of my old mother.
He was smelling of cheap liquor.
"So, Sarika pushed him away."
After that he just went mad.
Tried to kiss her..
Caught her arm so hard that he has left marks!
"Sir, let him return home my husband will take him to a task."
Do not let him return is what I came to say.
Your husband is due for a promotion it will be very unfortunate..
..if instead of a promotion he has to sit in front of some anti-corruption inquiry committee.
Mukesh... pack your things right away and leave the house!
"Where will I go, Buaji?"
I don't care.
Go to a friend!
Or rent a room!
Very independent you have become.
You make enough money giving tuitions to get drunk on.
Mr. Khanna is lying!
I had just gone over to meet Sarika.
Everybody is aware of Sarika's reputation.
"Why her husband is targeting you, I don't know."
"But if you stay here, you will land all of us in trouble..."
So for God's sake please spare us.
Oye!
Tuition master!
What happened?
And what's with all this luggage?
Come with me...
Come in.
Settle down.
Mauritius.
My aunt's son lives there...
I was wrong to say we didn't know about the case.
It's regrettable.
"What exactly does it mean, that Ussing is listed in that book?"
"In light of the prosecutor's negligence and the testimony you pointed out, it is something that we're keeping a keen eye on."
- As a suspect?
- it's a possibility.
Right now we're focusing on finding the perpetrator.
The book won't be of much use to him.
It only contains car registrations.
He's wounded.
We'll catch him soon.
Then we'll hopefully also know what's happened to Emilie Zeuthen.
Will Ussing be investigated?
We'll leave it to Special Branch and the police.
Focus on our duel with Ussing tomorrow.
I'm not slinging mud without more intel.
"You must admit, things aren't too bad."
- Lebech would like to meet again.
"- Bloody hell, is she serious?"
The Centre Party have made their choice.
Will you check on the event tomorrow?
Yes.
I'll go in five minutes.
See you.
"Thank you for all your efforts, Karen."
I want you to know they mean a lot.
- It's my job.
"- Yes, but anyway..."
Do you have a minute?
"No, not really."
I'm off to the Ministry of Justice to check up on Mogens.
I'm sorry about everything that's happened.
How would the kts like to party with the ZBZs?
- What kind?
"- The biggest, baddest most rule-breaking party CRU will never see."
When you put it like that.
We're in.
Good!
Is you shirt on inside out and backwards?
It's just... joggging.
This is the common room.
"It looks like TV football, viewing party last night."
You guys surely know how to have a good time.
Welcome to our temple of good times and life-long brotherhood.
Our casa es su casa.
We're walkin'.
You got any question so far?
- What are your academic requirements?
- Every active member must take one course per semester or you get us skip talking to.
"But I mean, you have to take four course just to be in the Greek system?"
I'll look into that.
We're still walking.
Here are our lovely gardens.
Do you have any kind of mentorship program?
"The OC, they had a lot of connections."
"You know, CEO and like so."
"Last summer, bunch of the active did some paid internships."
That's a good point.
Jack Rabbit gives all the active and pledges 20% discount at his hut.
- Is that what you meant?
- Kind of.
It's good.
And here is the lovely recreation and relaxation room.
Excuse me.
Should I go on?
No!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Please!
"Take us to Schmidt, I won't say another word."
"Come on, Dixon."
I'm in a hurry.
Don't forget your Oreos.
"Counterintelligence, broadly speaking, is the practice of spying on someone who's spying on you."
"With a little patience, you can learn a surprising amount about your enemies just by watching their own surveillance teams."
"It starts with carefully observing who's at what location, when they're there, and how often."
"Once you have a list of possible candidates, you cross-reference with people from other surveillance sites."
"If anybody shows up more than once, it's a safe bet it's not just a coincidence."
It's a lot easier to keep your secrets if you know who's after them.
Gotcha.
Why can't we just knock on the door?
You don't know Calvin Schmidt.
He's not gonna open the door for five people with guns.
It's okay.
So I-I have to be your pretend girlfriend?
Come on.
Here we go.
Kiss for luck?
Never mind.
What the hell are you doing here?
"Hi, Calvin."
It's really --
Was I -- was I unclear the last time we spoke?
"I gave you a fat stack of cash, and I told you to forget my address."
"Yes, I know."
"But look, look -"
Are we at war?
(low gurgling)
"Uh, you know I think it's that darn sophomore with the deviated septum."
He must have closed his mouth again.
"Sabrina, could you come up here?"
I think I might have an antacid.
What flavor?
Can I have two?
I always carry the essentials.
Let's see.
"No, that one's for leprosy."
"So, thanks for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me."
"Hand me that towel, will you?"
(phone rings) What?
Fire him.
Your son?
He's not a closer.
"Anyway, I hoped if I could tell you what a wonderful place my clock shop is, you would find it in your heart to spare it."
(chuckling):
That's a good one.
Spare it!
"Oh, who sent you in here, huh?"
Artie?
"You're serious, aren't you?"
You really think there's anything you could tell me to keep me from squashing you like a bug?
We put a lot of effort into our selection of timepieces.
"Oh, well, in that case,"
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm going to count all the way to three before I call security.
"Before I go, could I just make one little point?"
"Oh, look who's been downsized."
This stinks.
I always wanted the good of Marie.
Are you looking for the fate of his mother.
But do
Two days after the board against the merchants of flesh guns and ideas?
And we try again with horses crazy.
"Mickey, you ..."
"The reserve, a thousand chances against one."
And the luxury of a desperate gambler.
Could I returned to Hungary but I prefer to leave in our world.
"I'm going to take the deposition of Mr. André, democratic, as a papal bull."
But I want to continue to follow your tracks.
And those of Marie.
Sharpening their teeth and shaking the handcuffs.
Gladly send you sterile with your coffin in Hungary.
You do not like me.
Fault ... her.
Marie is poor and defenseless.
She goes too far.
"Just so, innocent."
Remember that I am too generous with you.
As the same from me.
And this is my foot.
You know my foot?
A nice Calcione a hog foot Parisian.
And this in addition.
"So, courage, the man on the street with his suitcase."
So that if the steps even worse.
You still have all two ears?
"It is my fault, I would not have never had to leave you alone."
I like when bleed ...
But I would much that bloody for me.
"Curse you, Mary, full of ice."
That's really something!
-Let's sleep with this door open tonight.
-Why?
"I don't know why, but I'm scared."
"When I shut my eyes, the picture of those eyes gIares at me."
Cut it out!
Now you're going to make me have a nightmare!
Coward!
"Grandma's story, I wonder if it's true?"
"I can't believe that Suzukichi, who was a little weak in the head... came here to swim at night."
That just proves he was weak in the head.
Isn't it rather cold here?
Grandma says there's a water imp living in the basin of the waterfall.
Stop it!
Don't start a story like that.
"Come on, Iet's eat our lunch."
"By the way, what will you do if you go to Hawaii?"
"First of all, eat a pineapple."
You've sure got a limited imagination.
"Maybe it's only natural, since you're the reincarnation of Suzukichi."
"You are his double, including being weak in the head."
He was only joking.
"Tateo, what do you want to do?"
What else is there?
He'II devote himself to flirting with clark's daughter.
will you propose to her?
Don't be stupid!
emily is one of our relatives.
She's related by blood to Grandma.
Marrying her is out of the question.
You don't even know a thing like that?
"According to MendeI's laws, there's a high probability... for the offspring of a consanguineous marriage to be recessive."
From our Gyula's life there is a word.
Do not make a fuss already.
- Okay
Did you send him in into his house?
- Yes.
- Wrong.
I said that it is not allowed to be in consideration of me.
This pine smell.
This ozone.
"You do not know it, what this means to me."
"After the a on frontline service filled of 9 monthly,in intolerable noise and smelliness,"
"I cannot to say it, how much I am glad about your kind invitation."
"Well yet we, how we are glad."
"Terrific to thought to it, that what you may suffer there on the front."
My Gyula. my son.
It is not necessary to be worried about his.
"I take it beside myself as soon as the cold season begins, into the flag office heated well."
Kind major lord.
"Do you hear this, my sweet good Lajos?"
- How we say thank you for this the for major lord?
How we gratitude?
Thankfully i owe for the kind hospitality.
"Because I was like that already, than the chased game."
Be calm.
The your Gyula son's will be your good place beside me.
He loved that little limping child the best.
Himself bought it because of that always beside it.
Was not clever though.
He said it.
Onto your kind Gyula son's health.
- Thank you very much.
"- Thank you very much, major lord."
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.
That's why I was deluged with all those letters.
"- Bea, now look..."
"- Oh, I know."
But if I ever go away again and you don't write just because you're ill...
"Oh, don't you see how much more worried that would make me?"
It all amounts to this.
"February is a long way away, and your father will simply have to listen..."
"If you don't stop looking at me like that, I won't be responsible for what happens."
- Aren't public places awful sometimes?
- Awful.
- May I interrupt this loud conversation?
"- Oh, here you are."
"Sir Charles, glad to see you."
Sorry you weren't in.
You look fine.
It's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.
"Sorry to be late, my dear."
In an argument at the club.
What's on the program?
"I thought we'd go to Stewart's, if that's agreeable."
Excellent!
"But, while it's on my mind, Harry there's something we must straighten out."
I've gone through enough with Beatrix over this.
"I may be getting old and crotchety, but I won't put up with it anymore."
I'm afraid you must take her off my hands as soon as possible.
"Oh, Father!"
"Well, Sir Charles, that's..."
"Of course, I insist on all the trimmings:"
"Wedding at St. Margaret's, Bishop Manners, reception."
"Here's a sight for thee, look thee"
A bearing-cloth for a squire's child

All gold!

"In fair Bohemia, a son of the King's which Florizel I now name to you"
"And Perdita, now grown in grace, a shepherd's daughter."
"Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my son?"
"Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince."
I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd
"A man, they say, that from very nothing is grown into an unspeakable estate."
"I have heard, sir, of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note."
- Thou shalt accompany us to the place.
- I bear your command.

Five pound of currents?

We're not praying.
"We're taking the medication, and we're gonna get you home."
And you're gonna be all better.
Shh.
This stuff is hard to come by...
Psilocybin cubensis.
Where did you get it?
From a colleague running a clinical trial.
I have to send back what's left over.
I'm packing it into a gelatin capsule.
The trick is to get just the right amount.
It lessens the chance of a bad reaction.
Great.
Here's the leftovers.
- Put them in a safe place.
"- Thanks, I appreciate it."
My pleasure.
"Most people experience some nausea, but don't worry."
It soon passes.
I've set you up with five hours' worth of beautiful music.
- Ah.
"- Listening to music helps, so..."
Can I have the remote?
Thank you.
"Manuel will be standing by at all times with a tranquilizer, so if there's anything that feels uncomfortable or you feel any fear, you... you just speak up."
"- You say so, all right?"
- All right.
Okay.
How's the volume?
You let me know if there's any problems right away.
"Well, it's real sweet of you to keep coming here for lunch."
"You should feel great, ma'am."
"That was a solid, important defeat."
"I'm gonna go change my clothes... croak to the nation, and then I'm going back to bed."
This is good.
Moyes is threatening to go to the floor for an official investigation into what happened today.
- This is bad.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm in the middle of this.
"Does this mean I'm implicated, too?"
You know what.
Just say no even if it does.
"Well, Gary, you said you were important."
I can testify to that.
"Ben, this is one of those little hiccups that you said was not gonna happen, so I'm gonna leave this in your capable hands."
"Mike, you have to deny this like you've never denied anything before."
So lie?
The one thing I've been trying not to do?
"Look, I wouldn't ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself."
"And while that isn't true, find some comfort in it."
"- Okay, Gary?"
- Nope.

You listen to what Mrs. Walker's talking about.
That's right.

I'm going to walk up some dark alley... with a loud orange hat on my head and a whistle.
I can see the headlines now...
"""Golden Lords kill old man in loud orange hat..."

Ernest is right.
This patrol is a dumb idea.

No.

If I change his food mix a bit he acts like you're a heinous criminal.
- This fish aggravates me so much--
- What's the point?
The point is that someone has to ask themself:
"""Is the fish worth it?"" That's what it comes down to."
"Is it worth the aggravation, his pain in the ass ways?"
You're not a fish.
"You are a person, and you can talk."
I should have expressed myself better.
I should have said:
"""It makes me nervous, you giving me something."""
"And,""I'll get used to it, though."""
"And,""Thank you very much."""
How am I communicating?
Good.
- Who did you go up there with?
- Just some friends.
"- Oh, yeah?"
- Yeah.
You asked about Greg today.
- His marriage has problems?
"- Yes, he was asking what it was like to be separated."
"If I was glad, did I do the right thing?"
- What did you say?
- That it was tough.
"That I was unhappy, but if I got a shot at something again I might be able to do something with it."
I've learned a lot too.
"And I know what you mean, feeling like you'd take better advantage if you had another chance."
"Johnny, I'm seeing someone."
"- Oh, yeah?"
Let's go home together.
I have a friend waiting downstairs.
Welcome back Father!
"Well, hello there."
I didn't think I'd meet you here.
But I came to greet you.
How did you know I was going to be here?
"Well, you said in the letter that you'd be coming back on the train with someone from the museum, so I thought you'd be here."
That's pretty smart.
I have some business to attend to.
It won't take long.
Would you like to come along?
We could get something to eat.
Wouldn't I be in the way?
No.
I'm going to meet someone from a textbook publisher.
They want to use something I wrote for a Japanese textbook.
"Keep your elbow up, but keep this shoulder down."
"Father, Numata is really annoying."
Why?
Because he hangs around mother.
Because he's her manager.
"If he says something he shouldn't to mother or Shinako,"
I'm going to challenge him to a duel.
A duel?
That's pretty extreme.
The ruins of our family's old house are overgrown with weeds.
"Mother and Shinako are thinking of putting a dance studio here, right?"
"Yeah, but not if they don't have the money."
"By the way, when I was in Kyoto,"
I saw a camera magazine with Shinako's portrait in it.
Takehara probably took that picture.
"I'll give you a lift, whereever you're going."
"Tell your fucking Minister,"
I clean up this city all by myself.
That I defend the law in spite of the laws.
Raising the rats against each other.
It's an art rarely appreciated.
Are you going to get me my medal?
I'll tell everything!
I can't go further on.

Don't swallow the pit.

He's been in there for hours with that bitch of his.
Do you want to unbind him?
"He keeps the door closed, and says nothing."
"Try to shake him up, for fuck's sake, or we'll miss the big barbeque in the white city."
You are the only one.
And you didn't do anything.
"Léo, it's the Prince of Idiots."
Use his.
Where is Alexander?
Are you stupid or what?
"There were problems, OK?"
- Why is he on the ground?
- He had this on him.
Why didn't you take him in?
- We wanted to talk to you first.
- Oh?
We were a bit hard on a pusher.
The one who supplies your son.
We broke his rib.
And you're judging the case.
Can I take my son home?
- Get in.
- What about my car?
I'll get it picked up.
If word ever gets out...
PARENTS
I am sure my father realizes perfectly well   that stuff happens that shouldn't.
I don't think he gives a shit.
To him what matters is that I get some qualifications   and when I am with him and his people -
- I play ball and behave the way he wants.
What matters to my parents is that you do something with your life.
They aren't that emotional.
They have no idea what we do at weekends   as long as we get good grades.
It's off their radar.
We haven't had the close family ties everyone else has.
Lousy attention is better than no attention.
Do I feel neglected?
My father has never been to watch me play football or anything.
Some of these parents are unable to help their children to straighten up.
"You see something,abs?"
Beauty.
"I mean,it's tragic,but if you were to see this tableau in a museum, you'd swear it was a brilliant commentary on the human condition."
What?
Corpse staring at a tv set?
It says it all.
"Well,it doesn't say who put him there or why."
That's for us to find out.
You shaved your mustache.
I liked you with a little hair on your face.
- Still got my eyebrows.
- Good point.
"I found finn's blood, hair and fingerprints on the plastic."
So he s probably wrapped in it.
But I didn't find any other prints on the plastic or the shovel.
No chance of grabbing the gravedigger's sweat off the handle?
After being undergroun it's unlikely.
"Strange case,huh?"
I had th friend once that used to display roadkill in his living room.
- He had an nea grant... - abby.
"Um,next I analyzed the soil."
It's compost material.
Rocks and small sticks.
Thing's over an inch long.
It would indicate that it was processed through a screen.
Pretty clean for dirt.
It's a commercial product.
"But the house was just re-landscaped, so it's not surprising."
I sent the acidity levels to ducky.
I then inventoried finn's personal items.
- Got anything with a date on it?
- Nope.Sorry.
That's all.
Mandrian and I were together.
The first thing I knew was when I came out into the corridor and saw Rafford.
And you?
I am called Levett.
Did you see or hear anything?
I was asleep in my quarters.
Would anybody else have seen you there?
- Why should anyone else bother?
"- All right, there's no need for that."
"There are worse things than being alone, Sonheim."
Being with you is one of them
"We're getting away from the point a little, aren't we?"
You were all knocked out by Sonovapour.
"At some time in the last 12 hours, your pilot was murdered."
"And since you're the only people here on board, then I presume..."
"No, we're not."
Dortmunn isn't here.
- Who is Dortmunn?
- Flight engineer.
"Well, where is he?"
"I want him found, Mandrian."
Search the whole ship.
He's got to be here somewhere.
"Sonheim, Levett."
Whilst your people look for him I'll go and see how my people are getting on.
They're on the flight deck assessing the damage.
Will you come with me?
Right.
"Well, there's nothing I can do with that, it'll have to be replaced."
What's the situation?
"We can fit some of it back together, but there are a lot of components that will have to be replaced."
She traveled around the world.
"Well, Anna-Kat is..."
Did she come to one of my basketball games?
No.
Was she at my back-to-school night?
No.
Did she ever check out my break-dancing crew?
Never!
All she does is come around and expect everybody to fawn all over her and listen to her talk about herself.
Unh-unh.
Not in my house.
"She was not there for me, and I am not gonna..."
Do you...
Do you have a pillow?
We're actually here to talk about Anna-Kat.
"And right now, she is feeding off of your anxiety."
"Uh, I wondered if you'd given any more thought to putting her on medication."
"Dr. Ellie, you know where I stand with this."
She is 6 years old.
I don't think screwing around with her brain this young is a good idea.
We'll revisit this if I find a bag of cat heads in her backpack.
Dr. Ellie says Anna-Kat is feeding off my anxiety.
She brought up the medication again.
I like how she's not afraid of you.
"So, instead, she taught me a few coping techniques for her."
She can either squeeze a stress ball or sing a song in her head.
"But I don't want to open the door to ""Frozen"" again,"
- so I just gave her the ball.
- Here's an idea... don't let your mother stress you out.
This is not me.
This is all her.
"No matter what the occasion, the attention always has to be on her."
We've saved a piece for some friends in Nevada to make sure that things go smoothly back home.
I want all of you to enjoy your cake.
"So, enjoy!"
-Happy birthday!
-L'chaim!
I saw an interesting thing happen today.
A rebel was being arrested by the military police.
"Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade he had in his jacket."
He killed himself and took a captain of the command with him.
-Those rebels are lunatics.
-Maybe so.
"But it occurred to me, that the soldiers are paid to fight, the rebels aren't."
-What does that tell you?
-They can win.
This country has had rebels for 50 years.
It's in their blood.
"I know, I've been coming here since the Twenties."
We were running molasses from Havana when you were a baby.
The trucks were owned by your father.
Michael.
I'd rather we talked about this when we're alone.
The two million never got to the island.
It mustn't be known that you held back the money because you worried about the rebels.
"Sit down, Michael."
Sit down.
"If I could only live to see it, to be there with you."
What I wouldn't give for 20 more years.
"Here we are, protected."
"Free to make our profits without Kefauver, the goddamn Justice Department and the FBI."
"90 miles away, in partnership with a friendly government."
90 miles.
It's nothing.
"This is Gordon, Sir."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
You're from Canada?
I'm very glad to see you here.
"Thank you, Sir."
Where do you come from?
"London, Sir."
"Yes, I suppose I should have known."
Your wings.
"Thank you, Sir."
"Company, eyes left!"
You've been rehearsing this for months on mock-ups of the terrain.
It should be as familiar to you as the back of your hand.
"Only, this is the real thing."
Operation Pegasus goes tonight.
You all know its purpose.
It's to bring back a piece of German radar equipment that's been helping to shoot down our bombers.
To recapitulate for the last time.
"Our first group will take the house and the radar post,"
"Meanwhile, we will hold off the Gerry garrison in the farmhouse."
Our second group will take and hold the beaches where we'll join them until the Navy can take us out.
Any questions?
Any suggestions?
Right.
"You men come from a lot of different places and a lot different units, but you have certain things in common."
Original Roman legions.
You are well armed.
I think you've been well trained.
You've got a full moon and a rising tide.
The rest is up to you.
Good hunting.
Grace is against it.
"They've had a very bad PR campaign in this country, badgers."
Me and Brian agree on this.
You very rarely hear a good news story about badgers.
"You never hear how you're hit by a truck in the middle of nowhere and next of all, five badgers took me to AE."
With their little paws.
You know Clint Eastwood in Honkytonk Man?
You know the film Honkytonk Man?
I feel a non sequitur coming on.
Did he ever at any point in that movie bump into a badger?
What happens in that one?
He's made up a film that doesn't exist.
"Honkytonk Man is a genuine film about a singer who gets TB and at no point in that movie is there a black and white flash in the background and then, ""I feel a cough coming on."""
You know about culture and stuff.
Is that a real thing?
No.
Honkytonk Man's a genuine film!
Was my sole purpose here...?
Is this an intervention?
Yeah.
Honkytonk Man's a really...
"When he makes something up, pin him down on it!"
Don't just laugh and let him go.
Please keep this in.
Has anybody heard of it?
It was a dream!
It was a dream!
Has anyone heard of Honkytonk Man?
"Why would Clint do tuberculosis, for goodness sake?"
You know what?
"Jesus Christ, this is how the Nazis started - just an idea round the table."
It's a really good film!
And I am going to need you for a half hour at the deputy's meeting.
I'm on the hill all afternoon.
With who?
Senator Gottfried.
"This wouldn't have anything to do with him being on the Foreign Relations Committee, would it?"
"Well, the ambassadorship may come up."
Smart move-- he'll be a key swing vote during confirmation hearings.
"I thought you were firmly against this, against us moving."
Why the change of heart?
Because it's clear how much it means to you.
"What happens if you actually get it, we'll have to deal with."
"Until then, I am here to support you."
But...
"Oh, I knew there was a ""but."""
You got to put on a full-court press.
"You got to lobby, politick, schmooze."
And a 45-minute sit-down at the Hart Office building is not gonna cut it.
What were you thinking?
"Dinner, our house, with wives."
- You hate hostessing.
- I know.
I do.
But I can put on a good show if I need to.
These are hands-down the best croquetas I've ever had.
This was my favorite part of living on the move as a kid-- all the new food.
I'm sure it was a relief to get away from the Moscow cuisine.
You got that right.
"At eight years old, I'd had enough borscht to last a lifetime."
You defected when you were eight?
- Mm-hmm.
- You must've been scared.
My sister was even younger.
Any why would that happen?
Kyle's covered all the angles.
I'm sure he has.
Then why don't you just relax?
"Kyle's plan has to work, otherwise he won't get to Amanda before she's gone for good."
?
"Think about Amanda, how much you want to see her, to hold her... to touch her."
"Josh, eww."
What?
He needs an emotional trigger.
The other thing I need is silence.
Good idea.
"Lori, out!"
What did I do?
This is man's work.
I so wanna make a joke right now.
She could have stayed.
"Yeah, but I'm about to get all mushy, and I didn't want her to hear it."
"Listen, Kyle,"
I get how messed up you are right now.
"If anybody told me I couldn't see Andy ever again,"
"I'd be a mess, too."
But you've got to pull it together.
You really think I can do this?
Knowing how much you care about Amanda?
Zero doubts.
Come on.
"Deep breaths, just take it slow, one bulb at a time."
"By focusing,"
"I could control the flow of electrons along the wire, much like driving a car along a narrow road."
"In this case, the road led into the Trager house's electrical system, which in turn connected to the neighborhood transformer."
"Through the transformer, I was able to reach Amanda's house and gain access to the house's electrical system."
- I don't know.
It's gonna take a little more yabba yabba.
Good.
Go help Ziva and McGee.
I gotta see a lady about a card game.
"Anything, Abbs?"
"Four decks scanned, two to go."
"Naturally, there's no shortage of fingerprints."
- I.D.'s?
- Mostly sailors.
And the blackjack dealer.
Of course.
He touched every card.
"You know, it would help to know if I was looking for someone specifically."
Yeah.
Just keep looking.
"That the best you got, McGee?"
"Well, the only surveillance of the pizzeria was from a rooftop across the street."
"Lucky us, all the video files were corrupted."
"But we believe this is Petty Officer Adams, based on the time he is seen leaving the pizzeria and the direction he is headed."
Anyone else?
There's this man.
Left a few frames before.
Who is he?
"Well, we still don't have a clear shot of his face yet, Director."
Wait-- in the window-- is that a reflection?
"Enhance it, McGee."
He appears to be a civilian.
Sailor said a guy bragged to him about winning money.
"A ton of it, only, he was too impaired to remember who it was."
"But the game was rigged, so no one could have won a ton of money."
And that would make that winner a shill.
Maybe she still won't go out with you.
"Oh, god this is a fucking disaster."
"No actually, it's OK, it's fine."
- I can move away and change schools.
- My night hasn't been brilliant either.
"At least next week will be better, get my teeth into some journalism."
"Oh, yeah, the paper want to keep me on so there's no room for ya."
Tell me you're joking?
They said I was the best work experience they'd ever had.
This is an urgent message for William MacKenzie.
Please make his way to the front entrance as his mother is here to pick him and his friends up.

I love martinis.
They heal all wounds.
After about 1000 of them I'm still amazed.
But your poor liver has had to work so hard.
"I know, I know."
- I'm very proud of her.
- Your liver's female?
- The guy you kind of saw?
The guy that I saw leaving must've stolen the sword
And hidden in this room over here
When he set off the bomb.
I collected these grenades years ago.
Every last one of them.
I know I did.
"So, wait, whoever stole the sword"
Has other things that belong in the warehouse--
Which would mean that we have competition.
I don't know.
"Artie, just how long is this list of things"
We don't know?
I don't know.
About twice as long as the list of things
"That I don't know about, all right?"
"Well, who else would have these implosion grenades, Artie,"
"I mean, if you collected them all?"
"Well, whoever it is, if he's willing to use this"
"To cover his tracks, then it's somebody that's--"
What's a darker word for dangerous?
"If he did this to steal the sword,"
He'd have no trouble killing anyone
Who got in his way.
"Oh, none at all."
"Next time, don't get a suite--just a room."
Okay.
The lead here is the implosion grenade.
We find out who had one of those
And then we find out
Who has the sword.
"Okay, let me just--"
"We use standard fiberglass insulation, cdx subfloor."
You see something?
"Well,yeah,your joist,24 inches on center."
I wod have built them on 16.
Then you wouldn't make a profit.
That joist there look discolored to you?
Could be mold.
Mold spreads from the bottom up.
"Need a black.On it,boss."
We'll be there soon.
"Boss,abby ran the prepaid phone rd we found in finn's pocket."
Had only one call in it.
"It was to a self-storage company in dale city,virgia."
Good.Call the storage...
I did.
how ****I was just taking a breath.
I called the self-storage place.
"Finn paid for the un in cash, only signed in once, so I figured that ziva and i should probably get down therand check it out."
Sorry abouthe breath.
Kind of reminds me of pacific heights.

Ducky thinks the blunt object hit his temple.
Or maybe his temple hit a blunt object.
Which would have landed him nose-first in th insulation.
Get a sample of this wood back to abby.
"Oh,my god!"
"Bob,why are you letting them destroy our property?"
Her son was on the football team.
Good for him.
I'm not sure if it's good.
Okay.
Have you been drinking?
At work?
Of course not.
"Although, since my day has been extremely trying,"
I am gonna have a drink now.
"Yeah, well, my day has been no picnic, either, so... how about I join you?"
Sure.
Just completely infuriating how some people are... so...
Treacherous?
It's like one of-- one of our investors.
"He's-- he's one of those people that's like a-- like a virus, the kind that mutates, metastasizes into a cancer."
"Yeah, how do you get rid of people you want to get rid of?"
You redouble your efforts.
Why don't we ever do this?
What?
Drink together.
Because I'm always standing here and you're always in the kitchen.
"No, I mean-- I don't mean like that."
I mean-- why don't we ever talk?
- Aside from every day?
"- No, I mean--"
I mean really talked or... make love.
"Libby, we-- we've been married a very long time."
"Yes, we have."
God knows I'm not talking about fireworks.
"But if you were dying and you had one final moment to... look back at your whole life, at the things that mattered the most to you... what would you say about our marriage?"
"Well, we tried our best."
Both of us.
"First of all,his body wasn't found for days."
He was buried deep in the building.
That often tells us that they know each other.
Not to mention it took many botched attempts to burn them.
Because the unsub didn't realize how difficult it is to actually burn a human body.
Or it's overkill.
He wanted proctor to suffer the most.
Which definitely makes it personal.
"If he knew the first victim,it's a good chance he knew them all."
We just have to find out how.
We can start by talking to tony torrell's wife.
- How you doing?
- Uh...
I'm fine.
"Uh,i'm here to see agent rossi."
He's going to be with you in just a few minutes.
"If someone were following me right now,"
"Do you really think they could stop me from, say, uh,"
Breaking your neck?
"If I didn't care about getting caught, that is, and..."
I don't.
"Look, I get it."
"You and the people you work with,"
You're gonna do what you're gonna do.
You'll be watching pretty little jenny
And you'll be watching pretty little me.
So maybe it'll be her.
Maybe it'll be someone else.
The important thing is is that devalos knows
About all this ahead of time.
"That way, if he doesn't step up,"
The girl I find...
It was recently brought to my attention that I am always the girl with the wry commentary and the patented eye roll.
Honest question.
Do you think I'm a cynic?
Honest answer?
Absolutely.
You're Miss Possible But Not Likely.
About my own life?
Of course.
"But watching those two, who am I to say they're not meant for each other?"
"I mean, look at them."
Have you ever seen two people look at each other like Kyle and Amanda?
Not in a while.
"Amanda, you said we need to talk."
Right.
You didn't think I meant-
Maybe a little.
After a few people weighed in.
The one time you didn't take my words literally.
Did you really think my feelings had changed?
Is that why you brought me here?
"I brought you here 'cause everyone else was making assumptions about what you wanted, and how you were feeling and what was right for you."
But no one was actually asking you.
That's why my feelings for you could never change.
Didn't know the lights out here twinkled.
Only for you.
You have no idea how disappointed I am right now!
Mom- Save your excuses!
Your flight leaves in less than two hours.
My flight- You heard me.
But you haven't heard her.
You have nothing to say in the matter!
But I do!
Just let me assure you that I am informed of everything you do
"It was Corbett, wasn't it?"
"Now, don't try and change the subject, Merle."
I would like an explanation.
What exactly did you think you were doing?
- Eloping.
- Ha ha ha.
"Well, we'll forget all that romantic nonsense for now."
But your Mr. Danny Pierce can consider himself fortunate if I don't have him arrested.
How did you know his na--
Why can't I get married?
Because you are still a child.
I'm nearly 21.
"I wasn't referring to birthdays, Merle."
"Some girls are ready for marriage at that age, but others, like yourself--"
Well... what I'm trying to say is I'm afraid that you should never get married.
You're--
You're just not well enough.
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.
But it's better to face it now.
There will always be unscrupulous men after your money.
No.
Not Danny.
I'm afraid so.
"I'm having him investigated, and I'm sure we will find he's nothing but a cheap fortune hunter."
That's not true.
You're lying.
Now that's enough of that kind of talk out of you.
You'll go to your room immediately.
"For punishment, you wanted to wear Grandmother's diamonds to the party."
I'm afraid that's out of the question.
I don't care.
Why don't we toast something interesting?
Like what?
Like Geronimo there.
He's interesting.
In a pig's ass.
Don't you read the papers?
"They put Geronimo in jail, where he belongs."
"Let me ask you something, Tex."
Who's Geronimo next to Jim Corbett?
Geronimo's a man so great... that Corbett there'd have to stand on his mother's shoulders to kiss his ass.
Frank.
- What's your name?
- Tom Horn.
"Do you have a gun, Tom?"
"- No, I don't."
- Good.
Then you're gonna get exactly what you deserve.
I don't know where you come from... but the manners that you arrived with are just awful.
I'm trying to imagine how you could make such a reference... to the mother of the future heavyweight champion of the world.
You ain't champion yet.
"Besides, you're acting like an asshole."
- I could go to the penitentiary over you.
"- Now, wait a minute."
"Before we start this fight, I wanna ask you one question."
- Is it about my mother?
- No.
I've said enough about her.
"If I win this fight, am I the champion of the world?"
You're not big enough.
Then what are you picking on a little fellow like me for?
"You get in a fight in a public bar, they'll discredit you from your profession."
I'm gonna save you from that.
"That's class, eh?"
Not even lost her appetite!
"The best for you, my gem."
My black gem.
I'm not a black gem.
I live like my mom did.
"In expensive clothes, in luxury, in flesh, without pleasure."
"But it would be good to find somebody that loves me, a husband, just like in real life."
"The Venom family, you know there are four of them?"
I'll make Ancient Mariners out of them.
Impressed?
Me no high school!
A black gem in the hollow of dunes.
"Cold Venom for the vultures, and a gold toothpick for my father."
That's the lineup!
Now paint the town red!
Shift asses!
Shake heads!
Hey you!
"You don't care about turning up late to my engagement, making wallpaper out of my bro?"
"Sure Martine, you're pushing it!"
"Listen, I was in pain!"
Everyone has monthlies once a month!
"- Come on, eat, drink!"
You got here at 9 like everyone else!
- You're too rough handling her!
"Hey baby bro, feet too busy spinning in your oatmeal?"
"A cheap, pathetic fuck, that's tops for you lot!"
"Princesses for Princes, and trailertrash for flunkies."
You'll never get beyond that!
"That's not about you, Prince."
"If I hadn't used my brains to work my ass off for six months, we would never have pulled the job off."
We're sending Scooby and Shaggy in to work this lead.

MAN:
Password.
Joshua.
Nice.
Joshua was the backdoor password that Matthew Broderick used to access the Cheyenne Mountain Nuclear Complex in the 1983 sci-fi classic War Games.
That's right.

"So, which one of these lovable rogues is our Han Solo?"
10 o'clock.
In the bean bag chair.
He goes by Null Legend.
He authored Cherry Bomb.
"(laughs) Well, look at this."
Captain Bird Turd is slumming it with the code jockeys again.
"What, did you blow through your millions already?"
Nope.
I was hoping you could help my boy here.
"See, someone's been using Cherry Bomb to creep on his sister."
"Sorry to hear, but I just give people the tools to hack, it's up to them to do so responsibly."
"Besides, my customers pay top dollar to stay anon."
Except they're not so anonymous to you.
"We both know that you keep records of all your buyers, so that way, if the heat does come down, you've got someone to roll on."
"Let me be clear, okay?"
"It's not that I can't help you, it's that I don't want to."
And I think you know why.
This is going great.
About as well as I expected.
"Okay, all right."
"Okay, it's obvious you two have some history, but can we just take a step back and focus on my problem?"

"Hello, Lena."
"These drones are gonna put us out of work, Joan."
Have you spoken with Annie recently?
She doesn't work in my division anymore--you know that.
"Well, I'm sure you know she applied for a transfer out of the D.P.D."
And yesterday she filed for a week off.
"- She has vacation days, right?"
- Mm-hmm.
Many.
"Well, that's what they're there for--vacation."
I'm sure she just needed to recharge her batteries.
"In all the time I've known Annie, she's never been one in need of recharging."
"If she needs the time off, just give her her space."
"Look, right there."
"Joan, maybe we'll hang on to our jobs after all."
You still haven't answered my question.
Do you know where Annie is?
"No idea, Joan."
"Look, I know it's not my place to give you advice, but I'd ease up on the micromanaging."
"In my experience, operatives only rise as high as you let them."
You're right.
It's not your place to give me advice.
Sorry for the wait.
"I was briefing the commissioner about what we found on Jai's murder, which is still not a hell of a lot."
"Well, that's why I'm here, sir."
"If I were known only by my footwear,"
I'd hang myself.
Beth Ellen Hansen always looks like she's about to cry.
I wish someone would just kick her and get it over with.
"And then of course, there's our teacher..."
Miss Elson.
"She's nice, and polite."
"I bet one day she goes on a psycho killing spree, and all her neighbors will say..."
"""She was nice and polite."""
"Well, from what your last two teachers tell me, it looks like déja vu all over again."
It's time to vote for a sixth grade class president.
"And for the third year in a row... we're down to our final two nominees, and they are Harriet Welsch and Marion Hawthorne."
"And so, as you may know, the duties of the class president include taking attendance, reporting bad behavior and best of all, editing the sixth grade newspaper."
And now we vote.
Marion Hawthorne... again.
Three years in a row.
You know what?
I think I'll invent a poison.
"A really good, clean, untraceable poison."
One that fries your brains and makes all your bodily fluids boil at once.
- Could you?
- Check it out.
"One day I'd be like, ""Oh, hi, Marion."
"""Oh, no, I'm not finishing this soda."""
And she'd be like...
I'm serious.
Any of you guys want to come over?
I got to get home.
"If my amoebas start incubating, they really stink up the house."
Harriet?
Sorry.
Spy time.
It's a psychological truism - people talk about what they can't do.
"Is that why you always talk about acting, plop pants?"
"Perhaps there is a land beyond the oblivion of brain death where your observations would be understood, but to us earthlings, they are mashed potatoes."
So keep them to yourself!
"Richie, it's your choice."
"I can either stuff the meat into the oven, you into the oven or the oven into you."
Which is to be?
The former.
Which one was that?
- That was where the oven...
- Meat...
It doesn't matter.
Tarby'll be here in ten minutes and we haven't cooked a thing.
Get this stuff in the oven.
- I'll never get it all in.
"- Oo-er, sounds a bit rude."
Gonna need something to lever it in with.
"Oo-er, sounds a bit ruder."
"No matter how much I stuff in, there's more to be pushed in."
Oo-er.
It sounds even ruder than it was before.
Thank you for these observations.
Every culinary exchange should be accompanied by the rantings of a braindead vegetable.
"There we are, it's alight."
"Ooh, it's Tarby."
"Oh, God, Tarby's here."
"Oh, God, it's Parky, it's Tarby, it's Lynchy."
The whole gang's here.
"For God's sake, don't do anything rude."
"Hope I'm not late, loobies."
I bought you a bottle of wine but I drunk it in the taxi.
"Oh, God, I'd forgotten I'd invited you, Filthy."
I'm going out and get a morning whiskey.
"If all goes wrong, I'll come back and sleep in that stall."
What about your tack?
Just leave it in there.
"Anybody that's brave enough... to go in there and get it, they're welcome to it."
"- Harry, pass the champagne."
- Breakfast champagne in Hagersville.
"Now, how can I pass the champagne when Dexter here drank it all?"
"Barkeep, a little more champagne."
Soon as we get to San Francisco...
I want to check out where Mahare is training.
Gonna be pretty tough.
"I understand he's copying your style, Jim."
I'm not worried about him.
"The last 10 guys he faced, he knocked them out."
"He's never seen Jim's footwork, either."
Remember that Florida fight?
"You were so fast, he couldn't land a punch."
That new punch of yours is the greatest in the game.
"Tex, did you ever hear of a hook punch?"
"No, I haven't."
We're toasting the man with the greatest hook punch in the world.
"Barkeep, give Tex some champagne so that he can toast with us."
- I'd rather have whiskey.
- Give him anything he wants.
"Jim, you brought a touch of class to this game."
And a lot of pretty ladies.
"Tex, you ready?"
What are we toasting?
We're toasting the next heavyweight champion of the world:
"""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett."
"He's gotta fight for it yet, so he ain't champion."
"You mean, what did I do with it, you obsessed woman."
Black Widow.
"First of all, Robin and I will wanna return all the stolen moneys to banks A through H."
What a perfect idea.
- And secondly-- Batman.
"Oh, it's really you."
"In cape and cowl, commissioner."
Why?
"- I'll explain later, but thank heaven."
- And this is Black Widow.
So you're the she-devil who's been robbing us out of house and home.
"Oh, you must be Chief O'Hara."
What a delightful surprise.
"Why don't you ask her if she'd like to go along to jail with you, Chief O'Hara?"
"Oh, don't ask."
"My heart says no but my brain says yes, love."
I feel it's my responsibility to tell you that you have the constitutional right to consult with your attorney before answering any questions.
-Ah!
But I want to answer his questions.
"Sweetheart, I cannot tell you how much you remind me of my dear departed Max."
"- You'd better come with me, Black Widow."
-Thank you.
"Goldberg, you take care of the rest of them."
"I can't wait to see how it turns out, angel."
"If it really looks good, I'd love to have you come over every day and give me a wash and set."
Why don't we have a look?
Ah!
Fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
And only Batman knows for sure.
Batman there's a question I got to be asking you and the Boy Wonder.
"Yes, chief?"
THe difference by that time was that He was really determined to be an actor.
"Now, you edge over a little bit, ""Mr. Maverack."""
I don't want to get a bill for tbat mirror.
He did some Maverick episodes.
I don't know How many He did.
He did one or two.
You could just tell clint was going to be somebody.
He bad great stage presence.
We were both very young at the time.
He was offered Rawbide and I remember we were living across the street from each other.
"I was backing out of my driveway, be was backing out of bis and be said be needed to talk to me because be was offered tbls series."
"He said: ""Wbat sbouId I ask for?"""
"I said: ""I don't know, but I tell you wbat not to do."
"""Just don't get locked up so tight you can't get out. """
Tbere's plenty of places to bold tbem off once we're across.
I don't tbink tbe wagon will make it across tbe stream.
We'II bave to try.
"But it was pretty obvious that Clint, even though Rowdy was not the lead role He was the outstanding actor."
First time I bad a scene witb clint I was playing a Native American.
It's good.
"I pick up wbite man's ways, mission scbool."
Mission scbool?
"And I say: ""Quadero bas eaten of tbe dark musbroom."""
Quadero bas eaten of tbe dark musbroom.
His words are witbout sense.
"Clint started breaking up, and I did too."
THe director said¸:
"""WHat's the matter?"
"""WHat's so funny?"""
I said:
"""This kind of reminds me of macbeth."""
And tbe guy says:
Thank you.
Go with happiness.
"Oops, excuse me."
"Hey Tris, I really like your hair by the way."
Did you try to cut it all short and weird like that.
"Peter, why don't you take your food and sit down huh?"
Or what?
Besides I think we all should stick together now that we are officially fugitives.
Wait what do you mean by officially fugitives?
Oh you don't know?
You didn't tell Caleb?
"Yes, now Jeanine is saying that the attack on Abnegation was orchestrated by a group of regenade Divergents and their sympathizers."
So they're blaming this whole thing on us?
Yeah.
And Jeanine needed a reason to petition the council to institute martial law.
And now she has one.
Staying here at Amity is our best option for now.
We need to keep an ear to the ground and find out where the rest of Dauntless are.
- Then we can make a move.
- We need to kill Jeanine.
"I know, we're not ready yet."
"- Beatrice you're not being serious, right?"
- No I am being serious..
I'm not gonna stop until she's dead.
Tris you can't just go around killing people.
"No she's right, listen to your sister."
"Tris, I think you should go to"
Erudite and kill Jeanine yourself.
I'll stay with Caleb so you don't get him killed too.
What?
"Come on, you know... like you did your parents."
Stop!
What if he comes to know that the girl is a lawyer?
You must be lucky that a beautiful girl resides with you.
Then why should you bother about her job?
-What are your blabbering man?
"-Oh no, he scolds me."
- You can not face competition at your house?
Just because she looks good we can't take such decisions.
- If only she is an advocate...
"- No, she is a software engineer."
He is going to puke over me after eating all this.
Look how he tears off the chicken leg!
- Have you got my phone number?
- It is good that you reminded me.
I can't harm myself more than this.
I should change my number immediately.
First..
"- Hey listen, first comes only once."
- May be he is utilizing me to taste all these different drinks.
- Hi dude - dude?
Why should we maintain decorum after we are drunk?
You are always a dude.
Can I ask you a question?
Please ask.
If you paying for your drinks how much would you drink?
- I never buy my drinks.
- Why?
If you buy your own drinks then you'll wipe out all your savings on booze.
"- But if some one like you buy me drinks, I shall oblige."
"- Me, you mean?"
Buying willingly?
- Boy
- Hey don't come.
Follow me.
Take a seat.
- I'm DS...
- Tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
"As I was saying, I'm DS Arnott."
DC Fleming.
"Mr Fairbank, we'd like to begin by asking you about a social worker who went missing in October '98, Oliver Stephens-Lloyd."
Doesn't ring a bell.
"If we may, sir, perhaps this report might jog your memory."
Blind as a bat without these.
Are you sure you don't want a tea or coffee?
We're fine.
"Thank you, sir."
Sorry.
The report was copied to you.
"I mean, is there any reason you might take an interest?"
None at all.
Can you explain why you'd be sent this report?
"Well, I don't remember any of this."
"I mean, you're going back a good many years."
"We'd like to show you some newspaper clippings, if we may."
You appear to be quite close to Councillor Dale Roach.
Our paths crossed occasionally.
Usually at a charity event.
We weren't close.
"Well, we're looking into allegations of child sexual exploitation involving Councillor Roach."
"As head of Vice, did you ever deal with any complaints against Roach?"
"Well, there may have been some such saying,"
"""Councillor Roach has done this,"" or, ""Councillor Roach did that."""
And what would it be that the councillor did?
It's just busy.
"Los Angeles in January, San Francisco..."
"Powell's in Portland, the whole West Coast thing, really."
I'm told to expect big things out there.
- You sound like you're bragging.
- That's because I am bragging.
And you're doing a really hurtful job of sounding unfazed.
And do you know why that is?
Because you're not pretending.
"You're not interested in this or me, not even a little."
- Why would you say that?
- Because you never believed in me.
- And you don't now.
"- Well, good for you."
"No, not good for me."
Great for me.
"You know, you told me many times, now that I think about it, actually, that my goals were unreasonable and foolhardy."
Am I recalling this correctly?
"That my dream, the only dream I've had since I was 14 years old, to write and publish a novel of my own, wasn't something I could just reach out and have."
"Hard work, you tell me."
"Years of working up from the bottom, you tell me."
"Well, you know something?"
You were wrong.
"Dead wrong, actually."
About me and everything.
This was for you.
It's an advance copy.
I'd even written a little note on the dedication page and everything.
But you know something?
You don't support me and you never did.
So you don't get this gift from me.
"Not today, not ever."
"Just because a man has one perfect rose in his garden at home, it doesn't mean that he can't appreciate the flowers of the field."
-Does that make sense?
"-Oh, sure."
"But while you were out sniffing around these other little wildflowers, didn't the rose kind of fade?"
Practically out of the picture.
That's why I reformed.
"Hello, Brandon."
I'm very glad to see you.
"Rosa, this is Isabel Lorrison, an old friend of mine."
-Rosa Senta.
-How are you?
I think I'd better be getting back to my friends.
"-Yes, why don't you?"
-Isabel...
And thank you for keeping Mr. Bourne amused.
You're good for a few laughs yourself.
So long.
You've answered all my questions.
"A year of travel hasn't improved your manners, Isabel."
Was it my manners that interested you?
What interests me now is what you want.
Nothing that should frighten you.
"If you have something to say, say it at once."
-I haven't much time.
"-Oh, not here."
Why not?
Is your Mr. Dawning jealous?
Naturally.
"I may be a year older, Bran, but I haven't lost my touch."
"Let's go for a little walk, for old time's sake, or even just to prove that you're not afraid of the dark."
"You see, Bran, it's not so very dark."
"On the contrary, it's the blaze of noon, Isabel, revealing everything."
"As for my abandoning Claudia, she and I have come to terms with that."
And I really don't want your opinion on that subject either.
"Well, I should think you'd be happy for her."
"At least now, she has a real man in her bed."
I know what you're trying to do.
And it won't work.
What you and Claudia do is your business.
"I don't wanna hear about it, I don't wanna know about it."
So much for congratulations then.
Adam.
My congratulations to you.
My condolences to Claudia.
"- Hello, darling."
- Claudia.
- You look radiant.
"- Oh, thank you."
You must have had at least four job offers since this morning.
"No, job hunting is a thing of the past."
This came when you left the house.
Listen to this.
"""This is to advise you officially that you've inherited the oil well titled Blaisdel-Lankershim One at the bequest of Walter Lankershim."
"Your late husband's partner."""
It's incredible.
Congratulations.
"Now, have you decided what you're gonna do with your money?"
Aside from buying me an extra Ferrari or two.
But I don't even know how much is involved.
I know there's a lot of it.
I know what I'm gonna do with my independence though.
"Nobody's ever going to treat me like Claudia, the poor relative again."
I'm gonna use it.
"- And you know what, darling?"
It wasn't human.
All right.
Please... no...
"I'm so sorry, Lydia."
All of this must be terribly confusing.
But at least you know that you're not actually crazy.
Well... not completely.
"There's bound to be some residual effects, but you're a strong girl."
Personally I think that you're gonna pull through with a minimal amount of post traumatic stress.
Or maybe... a few years of profoundly disturbing nightmares.
"I had a plan, you know."
It was a good plan.
"But if there's one thing that I've learned in life, it's to always have a backup."
That would be you.
Your immunity makes you a perfect plan b.
You wouldn't turn from the bite.
You wouldn't die.
But you would be able to do...
One very important thing.
"Do you know what that is, Lydia?"
Previously on Teen Wolf
Someone's controlling him.
You promised this was only gonna be for a few weeks.
"Look, just because we're in a trailer does not mean we're trailer park trash."
Exactly.
We're worse.
We don't even have enough money to be in a trailer park.
"Don't have a meltdown, okay?"
It's probably just the generator.
You mean the thing that runs the electricity and water.
I'm sorry.
"We're supposed to have a nice lazy Sunday with friends, and you turned it into a smack down."
I-I promise I'll take care of it.
No.
"No, you said that before."
Give me the contract.
I'll take care of it.
There's a lot riding on this game.
- All right?
- I won't let you and Adam screw it up.
"Uh, Dave?"
You're my ride.
"So, Mr. Campbell, why was your accountant giving you investment advice?"
Talked me into this limited partnership deal in Arizona.
Son of a bitch cost me $2 million change.
"And Mr. Roberts wasn't licensed as an investment counselor, was he?"
"No, he's my--"
He was also a friend.
So was he advising you as your accountant or as your friend?
"Listen, Mr. L.A. Law, I'm not on trial here."
All right?
So just stop grilling me and do your job.
Unless you want to try for a matched set.
"I am doing my job, Mr. Campbell."
But if I'm gonna take your stupid case into open court...
I'm gonna need more than a girl fight between friends.
Excuse me?
"'Cause you've got crap for a case, Mr. Campbell."
And the jury's gonna take one look at your fat ass and say--
- What?
What?
Did you hear what he just said?
"- He's not starving, and he's blaming a friend for his own stupid mistakes, so good luck finding a lawyer dumb enough to take you on."
And?
I haven't come up with anything conclusive.
"I'm not an expert or anything, but I have a theory."
Yea?
I figure...
I figure heaven...
"is probably a place where, nobody cares how big or small you are, or what you look like."
People probably don't even have bodies.
They're just maybe like...
essences or something.
"But if they do have bodies, everyone's gotta be naked for sure, cause that's we all showed up here in the first place, right?"
"And also, if you have a back problem... or bad knees or self-esteem issues."
That stuffs won't bother you anymore up there.
And everything's free too.
Or at least whole sale.
"I don't know if there's animal, but that'd be cool."
"Oh yea, and when you walkin' in to the gate for the very first time."
They're probably playing' that Louis Armstrong's song.
Somethin' nice like that.
Part of this came from this girl I knew.
She died.
It's a long story.
"Anyway, she thought everybody would be naked, that part was her idea."
- How did she die?
- I don't wanna talk about it!
"I mean, I do but... when I tried, never works."
Maybe someday.
Wow!
Sit up.
Who wants some snack?
You know what?
Wow!
"Nothing with a new girlfriend, no hint that he might be in trouble, or where he might be hiding."
He has quite the fan base.
"Yeah, over 100,000 followers."
Some of these photographs went viral before he became known as an eSports star.
"Over 10,000 shares."
What's so special about that one?
(phone chiming)
Shinwell.
He wants me to meet him first thing in the morning.
You should turn in for the night.
- We're done here.
- What?
Just like that?
"Well, you're fatigued, or else you would've noticed."
"Not only did Tendu's most popular selfie likely motivate the attempt on his life, but the comments section has also given us a promising suspect."
"Ms. Lundquist, you promised your client would come in on her own recognizance."
I could send a couple of detectives.
"I'm sorry, Raina will be here."
"And you'll see, she has nothing to do with whatever this is."
She's a good person.
Can a fanatic be a good person?
"In my experience, the answer's almost always no."
She's not a fanatic.
She's... devoted.
Makes it hard for her to keep a schedule sometimes.
Hi.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.
It's okay.
I forgot to charge my car last night.
"Hi, hi."
"I am so, so glad that you granted my request for this meeting."
What a relief.
I'm glad you're OK.
"[noah] You too, Tensou."
Mm.
Where are the others?
I'm here.
It's still rough out there.
Yeah.
There's squads of those xborgs everywhere.
I stopped by the school.
Kids are working to put things back in order.
We're not the only ones refusing to let these creeps beat us.
But we have to figure out a way to beat that armada.
The world has never seen an invasion like this.
[screaming and explosions] The villains you have fought against this past year were just the tip of the spear.
The armada is an overwhelming foe.
I can't believe the warstar aliens were just the opening act.
Shh.
[banging]
Listen.
[footsteps]
Are you sure you weren't followed? [all sigh]
Dude.
It's just like the first day of school.
"You're late, but you know how to make an entrance."
I've been searching for Robo Knight.
Can you locate him?
"[Gosei] I am sorry, Troy."
I cannot.
The armada has affected our communication systems.
But I know we will beat this new enemy because of your fighting spirits.
It is finally time for you to tap into the infinite power that lines the walls of this command center.
That guy who was just here.
He's a special cop trained to track down foxes.
Special cop?
Didn't you watch that documentary on TV?
Everyone knows after watching that.
We have no time to watch TV.
"Wait, wait!"
There's a way that the special cop tracks down foxes.
He was testing you before.
The 'yes or no' thing.
That's exactly his method.
"Yeah, I was really confused before."
You're dead!
Will we eat him or not?
- What?
- Let's eat him after we talk.
"My sweety, be patient."
"- Now, keep going."
"- According to America's MK report, the number of foxes pretending to be human came out to 3,824,790.5 across the globe."
What's the 0.5 for?
Did I say that?
"Well, that one's a mixed blood."
So they organized the F.T.B.H.
The Fox-To-Become-Human secret community.
They kill people at will.
That's nonsense.
We don't kill anyone at will.
"Since we have to eat human liver on the 1000th year to become human, we don't kill anyone beforehand."
Right!
Rumors are always exaggerated anyway.
"Anyway, if you kill me now, you will be arrested by the police who are waiting to find evidence."
"Fox fur coats sold like hot cakes on the home shopping channel the other day, you know."
I think today would count...as one.
You know what I think she would like even more... is to see you wear it.
I couldn't possibly take it...
"Be careful, be careful this won't heal if you move around too much."
"If you want to help, tell me about that prison."
What kind of security do they have?
"Are there force fields, detection grids, physical barriers?"
"Yes, all of it."
What about guards?
Lots of guards.
The Mokra make a big show of it... always bragging about how no one has ever escaped.
Listen to me...
I can't bring you to the prison with me.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not afraid.
And that could get both of us killed.
You have to stay here.
If I stay here I can't bring the letters.
Letters...to the prison?
Letters.
Don't you remember how we used to write to her together?
Here they are.
I still write them... every week since she's been gone.
I've always known that one day
I'd be able to...
to give them to her.
I've never forgotten.
These are all to your wife?
How long has it been?
My last letter... my last letter's not... it's not here.
"Oh, I wrote it three days ago, butit's...is not..."
"I can't let her think I've stopped writing... that I gave up hope only, only days before..."
It's not bad.
But it was slightly unexpected.
"You weren't the person I knew, and you were really lively."
What's wrong?
It's fun.
"Drawing art, and chatting with everyone while streaming."
I want to hear more stuff like that.
I hardly know anything about you.
The reason why I started drawing illustrations was because Mom taught me.
I was naturally doing nothing but drawing since I was little...
And I was a professional before I knew it.
"Mom complimented me, saying it was amazing."
"After Mom was gone,"
I couldn't draw at all.
And I couldn't leave my room.
"But one day, I saw someone streaming."
That person was happily drawing while chatting with everyone.
I was jealous.
"I wanted to be like that, and tried it out."
I see.
It was really fun.
"After seeing the illustrations, they give me their opinions, like ""so cute"", ""so amazing""."
They ask me to draw more.
"I'm still in my room, but I can play and chat with people all over the world like we're friends."
"That, really, really makes my heart race."
I see.
It's the same for me.
The reason I became an author was because the people posting their novels on the internet seemed to have fun.
"There was a time when I wrote novels on the web, too."
That was a great story!
I drew a picture of the Hero Masamune!
"And, I got my first fan mail ever."
"Even if his prohibition is removed, my store is off limits!"
But who is this Unni?
Is she a doctor from the medical team from Korea?
She is!
That ethanol scent!
Who is she?
She is a full-time emergency relief team nurse assigned from Peace Maker.
It seems she works part-time in the hardware store.
"Ah, she does a meaningful job, which doesn't give much money."
"I'm doing it because it's fun, and you don't need money."
"But then Oppa, are you a fortune teller?"
How did you know my full-time and part-time job?
"I think I heard it from Daniel, about his Korean-Russian wife."
"What do you mean ""wife""?"
We're just comrades.
But what did you come here to buy?
There's everything except Daniel.
Can we use the wifi?
Wifi?
"Let's see, the fi is..."
Are you sure that the wifi works here?
"If you search thoroughly, I'm sure they will even have missiles."
Wait here after you finish your business.
It'll just be one hour.
I'll leave the doctor here for a moment.
Don't fight.
She has a gun.
Excuse me.
Don't worry.
I'm definitely sure there's a modem around here somewhere.
"On Friday at 0900, we apprehended two men who are assumed to be black market dealers, and passed them over to the authorities."
Report complete.
We're going home now.
I want us all to have dinner together.
I want the whole family... to stay together.
Please.
The sixth day.
The heavens and earth were finished and all their array.
On the seventh day God completed His work.
God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because on it He abstained from all His work.
"Blessed are You, our God, Who creates the fruit of the vine."
"Blessed are You, our God..."
"Alex, why don't you answer my calls?"
Are you afraid?
Are you avoiding me?
The play is about to open.
I didn't have time to call you back.
"Don't lie, I know you're avoiding me."
I'm not.
"It's not only me, it's everyone in the theater."
"We talked, I consulted with them."
And what conclusion did you come to?
"Publicly speaking, there's a problem here."
Publicly?
Do you want to hang him on top of everything?
I can't put a stop to the drift against him.
You are artistic director now.
You're just throwing him to the dogs?
I can't have him back until the trial is over.
And we all feel like we've been betrayed.
How did he betray you?
By fabricating expenses?
Didn't all of you fabricate expenses?
Not in those amounts.
I'm Dave.
- Nice to meet you.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
How are you doing?
This is where we normally jam at.
Everybody know to come here when you guys start singing?
"Oh, yeah."
My grandfather was one of the ones who introduced the drums to the church.
That's right.
"You know, Ben told me about that."
"It's an honorable, respectable family tradition, so much that you have it passed down from generation to generation."
It just brings so much joy to all of us when we can just come together and be able to just play together.
I don't know if every city considers music to be that important.
"And as a musician, I mean, that's the holy land."
Right now the storm is 225 miles south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.
We had a little gazebo in front of the house.
"Thank you, Killelea."
We will let your teacher know.
What do we think?
Mr Chandler?
Not quite up to it.
Mr Kirkby?
Button off.
He had a button off his jacket.
Slippery slope.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
We've had so many boys' voices break this year.
Hey.
"There's auditions in here, hop it."
"No, I've come for the auditions."
"Well, they're over."
"Again I say unto thee, hop it."
- Has anybody else seen them?
Only Selena.
She thinks I'm a genius.
What do you think?
Are they good enough to send to a magazine?
"Yes, if you want to end up in prison."
Those stories were full of enough libel and slander and double-entendre to hang us all.
"Allison, is that how Peyton Place really looks to you?"
They were only fiction.
I didn't use any real names.
You didn't have to.
I recognized everybody in town.
But let's get down to the important part.
You have a talent.
Those stories were a good start.
"Now, where do you go from here?"
That's what I hoped to find out from you.
Then I suggest college.
With your talent and your ideas...
"Thank you, but I don't want to go to college."
I never have.
Why not?
Because I don't want to study about writing.
I want to write.
Nobody has to tell me Shakespeare was a wonderful writer or that wonderful books have already been written.
Those books tell you how and why.
I'd rather find that out myself at a typewriter.
I need someplace to get me going.
Someplace to start.
"All right if that's how you feel about it, then let's do it."
Let's start at the Peyton Place Times.
"Who said I was a cynical, hard-hearted newspaperman?"
Aka award magnet.
You know I can't compete with death.
"Oh, it's my son."
He's driving back to college from L.A.
And I begged him to stop here on the way.
So he's gonna be here this afternoon.
"Well, how's he doing?"
"You know, I don't know."
He rarely speaks to me.
I get the occasional grunt on mother's day.
"Oh, kids can be so ungrateful."
"I mean, you get them the best nannies money can buy... and then they blackmail you with threats... to write a mommie dearest."
"Oh, look who's back from Hollywood."
What was it like doing Brad pitt's eyebrows?
Does he smell like fresh cream... on a fine spring morning?
'Cause that's how I imagine it.
"Elka, celebrities are just like everyone else."
You take that back.
"Oh, I'm just starting to wonder... if there isn't more to life... than removing celebrities' unwanted hair."
I think I'm having a mid-life crisis.
Mid-life?
"You know, if you really are having a crisis, maybe you should see a therapist."
The only therapy I need is liquid therapy.
Hello.
Victoria got another emmy nomination.
Congratulations.
She can't win.
She's up against a dead girl.
"You didn't have Susan Lucci killed, did you?"
No.
That was just trash talk. the oddest thing just happened.
My Agent says that there's this huge Internet rumor... that I'm dying from some disease called...
I gave my daughter.
My mother told me that was the worst mistake I ever made.
Is a terrible thing what he said.
If I were your mother
I would be very proud of you.
"Alice, long time was a lost soul."
I did not know who he was.
"One night a drunk date party and went into a dark room, and I let a stranger me cogiera until disappeared."
"There were no names or faces, only touch."
"Sometimes when you're lost, when you're totally lost,"
It is when you you find yourself.
Darkens the eyes of all and write up jobs.
"Plumber, IT consultant, Mrs. cleaning, accountant ..."
Dolly in part front and in the middle.
"""Queen of the swingers"" or something like that."
The final at the hotel is the icing on the cake.
You go there as a couple and takes all photos.
"Orgies, ugly, sex anal ... all those weird."
Do not.
"What do you mean ""no""?"
Much time and money
She has been invested in this.
We're about to print.
"If I do this, I will my way by myself."
"Alice, could talk at least?"
Where are you going now?
I have to finish my story.
"You like stories, right?"
"What's what you want from me, Alice?"
It's very simple.
Are we going to stay together and grow old despite all this shit or not?
"Because if not, then we are losing time."
..against him then too I wont believe it.
How did you believe it?
Who is the fool who believes that Krishna has stolen anything?
Then.. then why did you do this?
"Its very simple, Janki."
Try and understand.
I can tolerate anything but when someone..
..tells Krishna anything it pierces in me like an arrow .
Today that arrow pierced my heart when..
..those people called him a thief.
I have controlled my injured hurt with great difficulty.
I have raised this hand with great difficulty to hit him.
I told him to get out of this house with great difficulty.
But.. butjust think..
where will he go?
"The world is very big, Janki."
He can go anywhere.
And.. after a few bumps he will also learn to get steady.
"No, I wont let him drift like that."
"No Janki, you still dont know my brothers."
You didnt think that after I die..
- No.
Dont say that.
"-Yes, Janki."
You didnt think what they will do..
..to that poorthing after I die.
He.. he cant stay in this house and understand that..
..because he has a clean heart.
But why send him like this even if we want to?
"He wont understand any otherway, Janki."
And he will never be able to leave us and go.
Sir.. bless me with the hands you beat me.
It takes me a few seconds to realize that they're looking at me.
One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb.
Were you?
I was carrying this.
"I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond."
"I was out there, uh, skipping rocks one day, and then I look down."
"There's a beautiful black stone, so I take it home."
"A few months later, my mother shakes me awake in the middle of the night."
"She says, ""You've got five minutes to grab anything you ever want to see again."""
"At the time, I thought to myself this is the moment where my life changes for the worse."
So one of the things I grabbed on my way out is this little stone.
"Look, Pete, this is a touching story."
Are you going to tell me what this is?
Uraninite.
As in uranium.
"Oh, uranium."
In Connecticut?
We're one of the few states that's got it.
"After I analyzed Pete's stone,"
I had him take me out to the pond.
- Took some core samples.
- How much is down there?
It doesn't matter.
"Just from the surface readings alone, it promises that some big energy company will come in and buy us out."
Okay.
And how much do I get for not telling Audrey?
We can give you 2.
2 what?
2 million.
How much are you getting?
We're getting our share.
Your share is $2 million.
What do you think you're doing?
- My office!
Now!
"Enjoy your meal everyone, enjoy your meal."
Just calm down.
Was I not clear that the terms of your sanctuary here included non violence?
Well I can guarantee you nothing like this will ever happen again.
"Be that as it may, you can no longer stay here with us."
Your presence is just too disruptive.
Truth is that our sanctuary was never gonna last very long here anyways.
Was it?
With you not standing up to Jeanine.
- You don't understand us at all.
- No I do understand you.
I understand that you think you can stay out of this but you can't.
One day she's gonna show up and Jeanine is gonna take whatever power you think you have away from you.
Tris!
Tris!
"Look, Johanna, we need a little more time."
"I need to find out where the rest of the Dauntless are, then we can leave."
And then what?
Attack Erudite?
- I will not be a party to violence.
- No-one's asking you to.
We just need a few more days.
One.
"- One, what?"
- One more chance.
"See, to be Amity is to forgive others and yourself."
You're hurting Tris.
And my heart goes out to you.
I know what it's like to stand helpless while you lose the ones you love.
Along the river.
You were at the chateau de martin?
You know it?
Yes.
dirty your hands tearing my heart I'll get settled then.
into pieces so happy to be back.
"Yes, we're happy to have you back."
if this is the end then we whisper the wind and release it...
You heard about your mother.
I'm so sorry.
I'm back to plead with my father for her life.
I'll be gone from court once I have my answer
"And the matter is settled,"
And you and I will never see each other again.
I don't mean that to sound cruel or angry.
I understand.
You don't want to be seen as someone lying in wait
To reclaim your throne.
Or anything else that now belongs to my brother.
"They brought this back, after clarissa's death."
"I thought you might want to have it,"
As you were more parent to her than I.
They buried her in an unmarked grave
"Near the lake,"
Where the north road ends.
"I asked them to mark it with a cross,"
But it's unhallowed ground.
"What will become of her soul,"
I wonder?
Did she know any happiness in her miserable life?
When she was young.
The villagers who raised her for a time were kind.
News waits for no one...
Not even Chloe.
"You texted her, you left her, three voicemail messages at the apartment."
She's not Helen Keller.
She'll get the message and meet us there.
It wouldn't kill us to wait a few more minutes.
I agree with Mr. Olsen.
Why are we outside of the kitchen?
"It's a little late for a snack, isn't it?"
"I've seen you around here before, haven't I?"
You work for Lex.
He has nothing to do with this.
I'm here about that photograph you took.
Which photograph would that be?
Because I take a whole lot of pictures.
L. Luthor in his office before he killed himself.
I want that photo destroyed.
His death was tragic enough without it being sensationalized by the media.
You could have said that before you broke out the heavy artillery.
"As soon as we saw it, I immediately jumped on the delete button."
This is all a big misunderstanding.
You're lying.
I deleted it.
"After I saw your text message,"
I went into the mainframe and pulled it from your hard drive.
But the transfer log shows you uploaded the file to a second server with a cloaked IP Address.
I want to know where.
- You shot me?
!
- You weren't cooperating.
- How about a warning?
- Tell me or she dies.
"Yes, but beyond that."
The law is too narrow for me.
"For instance, the felon who never gets caught is still a felon, right?"
Right.
"Should he be noted, too?"
- I guess he should.
But how would you find one?
- That's another question.
"When we agree about that, the things get complicated."
"Is it a crime when father spends all his paycheck on booze, while his children walk around in torn shoes?"
That's a complex question.
Is it a crime when one doesn't care about his ill parents?
"I guess it is, if you say so."
That's why one should record it all.
"Otherwise, statistics is not complete."
"That's ok, but..."
I can't see why...
"- Why is all this for, right?"
Yes.
- I'm not surprised.
"As a matter of fact, I haven't explained you all about my work and what is the result derived from it even from afar."
You don't see a purpose.
Right?
"Explain me, then."
"Roughly, at least."
"Look, knowing about something means a lot, right?"
Right.
"The closer we get to the complete knowledge about what a crime is and how it occurs,"
I guess the sooner we'll destroy it.
"Yes, maybe."
- It's doubtless.
That's it.
Then why did you expect me?
Be seated.
Come on out with it.
Quick.
I can't wait for long.
Right kind of mood to have a cold drink.
What would you have?
"Limca, thumsup, or orange..."
You want to tell me something?
- Sory...?
"Oh... yes, I want to tell you something."
"You see, Miss Sheetal, I want to clear something with you."
So that there won't be any misunderstanding in future.
"Ifyou think, I am just putting on a show, but I love you vey much... lfyou think so, then let me tell you that you are right."
But...
I never thought that...
"Look Sheetal, don't tell me that you don't like me or love me."
I am a police officer. I promptly catch a person who tells a lie.
If I am not wrong...
did you say you love me?
But you are behaving as ifyou are giving me a speeding ticket.
Surely there are other ways too to express your love?
Indeed.
But they are worn out and outdated.
So I thought I'd ty a new style.
To help me succeed.
"Vijay, ifyou think you'll succeed because ofthe novelty then you are right."
"""A sense of fun fanned the fires..."""
"""there rose a bit of smoke, and the flames leapt up"""
"""Our friendship has blossomed into love"""
"""A sense of fun fanned the fires..."""
"""there rose a bit of smoke, and the flames leapt up"""
It was rigged to explode.
A S.W.A.T. agent was killed.
- Was anthrax involved?
- No.
Then that's not the final target.
"You look troubled, my friend."
You killed one of my men.
I was here with you.
The second location was a trap.
One of my agents was killed in the explosion.
This is war.
We expect casualties.
Shouldn't you?
- He was a good man.
"- Well... if he would convert, there would be no reason for him to fear death."
What do you say to his family?
I say:
Where... were you to mourn... when my son was murdered?
- His son?
- Did you see that?
"When he told the story about his childhood, the bomb landing in the bazaar, his behavior changed."
We know he was lying.
Garcia couldn't find any record of a bombing during the time Jind Allah was a boy.
"Exactly, but this time when he mentioned his son, he looked at his hands, like he had to concentrate to control his anger."
That first story wasn't about him.
It was about his son.
Which means it must have been more recent.
Garcia.
"I need you to look for a bombing again in Egypt, but this time anything in the last ten years."
On it.
"We're looking for civilian casualties, an 8-year-old boy."
Okay.
I backed up after that.
"- So, how did you end up at Skirt?"
- I just love Skirt.
"They have the best photography of any magazines, really... the most innovative, stylish, artistic shoots around."
How did you end up in magazines?
"I had an excentric uncle... who was my idol when I was growing up... he was a sort of black sheep, hip, rebel type."
"While my parents are always trying to drag me off to polo, blablabla... he was always abducting me and taking me..."
- on the most amazing adventures.
- Sounds like a cool uncle.
"Yeah, he was."
He was pretty much my savior when I was a child.
"My parents had a messy split, and he saw me through that."
He knew I liked to paint and he always encouraged.
So why don't you paint full time?
That's what I'm trying to do... but I like graphic design and it helps pay the bills.
So I made a routine out of that.
"Furthermore, I don't think anybody would like to buy my paintings."
Except maybe a pizza parlor.
I'm sure people would buy your paintings.
I have to get out of here!
I'm being harrassed!
These little beasts keep snugging me... begging for an autograph...
- annoying me!
- They are children.
And I'm not the fucking Pied Piper.
I don't want them following me.
Shoo!
- Get away!
Go!
- Calm down.
I'm gonna be... half an hour more at this.
Then we take...
- I know.
I'm used to it.
- Now listen.
- Red fuck!
We need help.
Somebody has been stealing our story ideas and trading them...
"- to Nian Zamoi, at Vogue."
"- I know all about it, pussy."
- Do you know who it is?
- We're not gonna do it that way.
"First, you're going to tell me what you know and I'm gonna"
- tell you if you're right.
"- I have a sneaking suspicion... it could be Pierre Larroux, our make-up artist."
Look deeper.
Look closer.
Follow the fashion!
What do you mean?
They are brilliant!
Did you design them?
No.
I have to give credit where credit's due.
- Sebastian designed them.
"- Yes, darling, you do know... that I have a better grasp on the subject than he."
"It's time to pile into the town cars and you can check the list... for what booths you're assigned to, and the times."
"And remember... when you're not in the booths, you're still representing Skirt."
I wish I could always have a cock this big this close to my face.
- You are disgusting!
- Actually... my room service boy in Paris... wasn't so different from the dimensions on this shirt
You should see him serve more than a petit dejanuai.
You chaseabout!
What did you have on your customs card... when you came back:
Business or pleasure?
What's that pounding?
Your boyfriend is up on the roof replacing the loose shingles.
"Okay, so it wasn't Santa claus."
"But you can understand what got me there, right?"
The poor guy's only been here one night and you're putting him to work?
He volunteered.
Mike Biggs volunteered to climb up on the roof and start relaying shingles?
"He was reluctant at first, but I promised him a pan of brownies and he shimmied up that ladder like his ass was on fire."
"Mom, we shouldn't take advantage of Mike's good nature."
Some might say his jolly nature.
"You know, he's been working hard."
We should make him a nice dinner tonight.
That's a great idea.
Remember our Sunday night dinners with daddy?
"We'll make pot roast, mashed potatoes, and banana cream pie."
Daddy's favorite.
"Oh, it's not Mike's favorite."
Who the hell's talking about Mike?
"I'm telling you, Carl, all I did was put a couple screws in a cabinet door and her mom made me French toast."
"I know, I feel like king midas."
Not the muffler guy.
You got to get a library card.
"Hang on, I got to earn myself some brownies."
"Hey, how you doing up there?"
You working hard?
"Oh, yeah."
Seeing you up there blocking the sun reminds me of when my husband was alive.
He was always working on the roof.
"Well, Chicago winters..."
lots of wear and tear.
I may be up here for a while.
You hungry?
"Oh, yeah?"
"Well, who was that?"
Goes by the name of Hector.
"Well dressed, well spoken, a grave manner, spitting image of you, in fact."
Are you referring to what I think you are?
To what do you think I'm referring?
"Every so often, I pay a visit to a friend of mine."
"We have tea and converse, for reasons I do not understand, and with no encouragement on my part, she likes to call me Hector."
Tea?
Tea!
Of course.
"Don't worry, the King will know nothing of these tea parties."
Hector.
I have not yet found the opportunity.
You must be patient.
I cannot be patient.
I know him.
"If I wait, he will find another, but not your equal."
But you agree.
He will find someone else.
This is the first time...
What?
...that I've see you like this.
Not the cold and distant goddess that breaks every man's heart and strikes fear into everyone in the salon but
"but soft, human, vulnerable."
And broken.
Go and see him.
Confront him.
Tell him your feelings.
"You're wasting your time, waiting and hoping."
"If he accepts you back, then you have reaped the rewards of your courage."
And if he rejects me?
"your parents, your dad, your mom, both your parents, your bottomless, sad love life, your less-than-great hair and all magazines."
"Not only are the bags silent, so are the chips."
Susan.
You left in the middle of the meeting.
Is everything okay?
Yep.
Just silently pooping.
"If a chip falls in your stomach and there's no one there to hear it, are you really sad?"
"New Shhhh-nacks, when you're trying to feed a hunger you can't let anyone know about because you're humiliated by basic human desires."
From the makers of Shame Spirals and Los Angeles.

"Hi there, Amy."
- How are you today?
- Good.
"Okay, so I am just gonna give you a quick breast exam."
Go ahead and lay back and relax.
Okay.
"So, have you had any new sexual partners since the last time I saw you?"
"Oh, nnn..."
What do you consider sex?
Penetration or...?
"Well, no, there's all kinds of different kinds of sex."
"Okay, then, yes, a bunch, but we used a condom."
- Their call.
"- Okay, great."
So I'm gonna have you put your feet in the stirrups and I want you to slide all the way to the end of the table so that I can take a look at your pussy.
All the way down.
"Like, slide your pussy all the way down to the end of the table."
Okay.
When was the last time you were bleeding out of your pussy?
"Um, two weeks ago."
Can-
- What?
"- Oh, I'm so happy."
- What?
I'm gonna move back into the house with you.
"Because now, I'm an equal to the Carringtons."
To any one of them.
You know something?
We're both getting what we want.
"Claudia, the dream is coming true."
"Here, we can talk in this office."
Thank you.
"Now, you've seen the CAT scan, doctor."
"Yes, I have, Your Highness."
And I'm setting up additional studies.
"You see, apparently, the king's condition wasn't caused by a bullet."
But rather by the fall he sustained when he was hit.
And if that's so?
Then we call it a flexion injury.
"And there's a chance for surgery, and there's also a chance that the paralysis won't be permanent."
But I'm afraid to say anything more until I see the studies.
"Now, you'll have to excuse me while I set up the studies I'll be working on."
Thank you.
Alexis.
How can I ever thank you?
"First of all, for getting my father out of Moldavia."
"And now, the finest medical attention possible."
"No thanks are necessary, Michael."
"I did it for Galen, but also for you and Amanda."
"You see, it means so much to me that you and my daughter are happy together."
Give her a little time.
And I know that she'll really appreciate you.
"Well, Alexis, I hope you're right about this."
Now you're gonna die in mine.
No one will even remember your name.
"I'm sorry, Clark."
I traveled halfway around the world via satellite.
There's no trace of Kara and Brainiac.
I can't let Lana sit in that asylum in pain.
Only way to help her is to find Brainiac.
I've tapped every radar screen known to mankind.
There's no bogey or blip unaccounted for.
It's like they just flew off the map.
What about Brainiac's power sources?
Check the electrical grid for any power surges again.
"Stay focused, Chloe."
Busy night out there.
What's going on?
Someone at Luthorcorp just jumped out their office window.
Rumor has it it was Lionel Luthor.
Let's go.
I just talked to him.
You said you were working down the hall from your father tonight?
I heard him yell.
Then he was gone.
"I know how difficult this must be for you, but I need a positive identification."
Whenever you're ready.
Thank you.
You killed him?
You killed dad?
"Not that I want to speak ill of the dead, but Lionel Luthor left a lot of damage in his wake."
Remember he locked you in a kryptonite box?
"He did a lot of things, but he'd never commit suicide."
I don't know about that.
He was beyond disturbed
- right. hmm.
"well, it's been a pleasure."
- oh. thank you.
"so, we cool here?"
"- based on my evaluation, you don't meet the minimum requirements for the department of child care."
- what?
what does that mean?
- we'll be in touch.
- let me see that.
- that is confidential!
- you still got to take me to town.
"- no, i can't go dressed like this. get in there."
[car engine turns over]
"- cindy, what are you doing here?"
"- don't you ""cindy"" me, you back-stabbing son of a bitch!"
- language!
"- or was it you, marge?"
- what is this all about?
- what's this all about?
!
your lard of a wife called the government people on me to take my kids away!
"- i am big-boned, and that is the way god made me."
- marjorie?
- i was doing my civic duty.
"- the kids could use a little more stability, cind."
- oh.
what kind of a person doesn't want their own mother to be with their kids?
!
"- cindy, you don't deserve those kids."
you need to take a good long look at yourself.
you rely on everybody to do things for you.
"you know, your kids don't even expect christmas presents this year from you because they know that, if you had one cent, you'd spend it on yourself, or you'd put it in some stupid scheme that doesn't pay off."
- You cannot break the Internet.
- Um.
"He was scared at first, a little panicky."
"He paced, slugged away at the form, swore a lot, but once he figured out his way back to the home page, there was no stopping him."
He was surfing the Internet like a 17-year-old.
"- So, what did you think?"
"- Worst form in the world, pain in the ass,"
- but it took me places.
"- In the end, the form itself became a personalized website, a profile page full of photos, life experiences, and friends."
"The senior volunteers were scared at first, but they all booked repeat sessions."
They loved that they had a place on the Internet.
Thank you.
- When will you come to Halifax?
- Oh.
You need a bigger team.
My office in Hamilton
"- serves 81,000 seniors."
- Oh.
"This is your whole life now, you realize that?"
Would the same thing work on kids?
I mean really young kids.
"Uh, would you just excuse me?"
"Mr. Renn, what are you doing here?"
"I came to see your presentation, of course."
It was excellent.
"- It's wonderful to see you, Mr. Renn."
- We're all very proud of you.
You had such poise up there.
"When you were working with us,"
I was worried about you.
You had your anxiety issues.
But look at this!
"""Totally fine."
"""I just don't know what you're doing."
"Can't really read it."""
"And then years went by, and she goes,"
"""You know what, you do you."
"""I'll just adopt some grandkids."
"I don't care anymore."""
But it's good.
"My relationship with my mom is getting stronger, which is really cool."
"I figured that, as I got older, my relationship with her would be more adult-to-adult."
"But what's happening is, I'm becoming an adult, and she's becoming a teenager."
Is that happening to anybody else?
[applause]
It's so strange.
"She keeps doing and saying things that she thinks are really cool, but they just weird me out."
"We were talking about weed recently, because my brother's going to art school in Colorado."
So...
He's minoring in weed.
"And she goes, ""I don't know"
"""why he had to go all the way to Colorado for weed."
"I can get weed whenever I want."""
"And I was like, ""You can get weed whenever you want?"
"Do you have a dealer?"""
"And she goes, ""No, it's in my room."""
"Which is not ""getting"" weed."
That's having weed.
"And I was like, ""Okay."""
And she was so proud of it.
"She's like, ""Yeah, I can smoke anytime I want."""
"And I was like, ""Cool,"""
and then changed the subject very quickly.
"I think that may have been an invitation for us to smoke together, but I didn't want to take it, because I smoke and drink to escape my life stressors."
But we're still going to have to keep moving.
You can still have that morphine shot if you want it.
- That's all right.
- It's okay.
I won't think you're any less macho.
Someone else might need it more later.
That's reassuring.
Thanks.
"You know, I hope what he's paying you feels worth it."
I don't work for him.
I work for the British government.
He's my prisoner.
I've been arrested for trafficking arms.
The weapons I was sending to save you.
So I struck a new deal.
"We help get you out, and he gives us valuable information about a terrorist."
"Which he knows about, how?"
And you expect me to be grateful?
"Well, at least you got your money back."
"That's something, eh?"
(PHONE RINGING)
"Colonel, we're picking up smoke trails at the water hole at Bir an Natrun."
The heat map indicates some sort of explosion.
If Stonebridge had managed to engage the Janjaweed then this would fit that scenario.
"Right, send through the image."
Julia thinks that lunatic might still be alive.
Really?
"It's probably nothing, it's an oil burn, or a blip."
Let me see that.
That's not nothing.
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Unfortunately I don't have the resources.
You said you wanted to meet him.
Besides we just got here.
Why don't you leave me alone?
"My uncle, who you saw in passing, raised me because both of my parents were killed in a car accident."
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to contextualize my sadness.
Put whatever you're going through into perspective.
My mom was pregnant at the time.
Seven months.
I was on the news.
"I'm telling you this to hurt you right now, because you're trying to make me feel bad, horrible even, which I don't appreciate."
But I never will...
Because nothing ever feels bad once you learn what that emotion is capable of.
Now let's not make a big deal about it.
I usually don't...
But you really forced my hand on this.
Do you know that expression?
"""Forced my hand""?"
It's one of my favorites.
She seems difficult.
She is.
Very.
"Well, you're putting her in an ugly situation."
What with you trying to have two girlfriends.
That's a tawdry way to phrase it.
(IKE CHUCKLES)
You have one living in a house that you share with her in the city and another one up here that you're living with.
"Yeah, I can see the appeal."
I practically invented it.
But I did it better than you.
Nobody hated me then.
I could enjoy it.
"- Oh, hey."
"Say, did you get Gene Hansen's toxicology report back?"
I'm looking for any evidence of narcotics.
I'll check and see when the results are due in.
"Okay, thanks."
Hey.
What's up?
You working that beetle mania case?
"Yes, I am."
I have reason to believe the club owner might have known about drug dealing in the establishment.
"If the drugs led to the kid's death, she could be held responsible."
"Uh-huh, you got it."
"Speaking of which, I need you to check some names for me - her and her staff."
See if they had any priors.
- Do you mind running them?
"- Sure, let's go."
"Yeah, I'll even throw in a little lunch, maybe a few..."
Wait a minute.
It usually takes a few minutes of sparkling repartee before you'll give up anything.
I'm trying to be nice.
Is that a crime?
"No, no."
Who's the customer?
"Hey, we doing this or not?"
Let's go.
All right already.
"Oh, glasses."
Hi.
"You know...when you're around someone long enough, you can spot their little clues, their 'tells'."
And this is apropos of...?
"Well, I was in the morgue today and Mike was there, you know, investigating that Jane Doe, and he offered to help me gather information, no questions asked."
That was nice of him.
"Once that line is changed, how will she make Angel realize that her father does not hate her?"
"According to the script, Lola is supposed to gently say,"
"""Dad actually loves you a lot. """
Dad actually... hates you a lot.
Daddy doesn't like me.
Why do you think that?
"Because Daddy never takes me out and he doesn't play with me, unlike you."
"Mary, you hardly ever see your dad, right?"
Yes.
"When you see your dad, how does it make you feel?"
Very happy and also very scared.
That's right then.
Right?
Think about it.
Your dad is usually very busy and doesn't have time to spend with you.
"Therefore, in his heart, he probably feels very apologetic towards to you."
"So when he actually has free time to spend with you, he becomes nervous and doesn't know what to talk about or play."
Is that what it is?
Yes.
"Your daddy just doesn't know how to behave around you, because you spend too little time together."
"But, in his heart,"
I'm sure he loves you a lot.
Do you know that?
Lian is just like all the other adults.
He only says nice things to kids.
I'm not so easily fooled.
"I know that for a long time now, Daddy..."
"For a long time now, Dad has hated you."
Mary.
I'm crying.
I can tell.
"I'm not sad, it's because Jie Jie's performance is so good."
Can we do this later please ?
"Sam, I need you to command the civilians, form them into fire teams."
I'll give my deployment orders through sergeant...
Deployment orders ?
Fire teams ?
"Come on, some of these guys have never even held a rifle before."
"Well, you've supposed to be the expert in turning civilians into soldiers."
"No, we were guerilla fighters."
All right ?
Hit and run.
"Keep moving, keep the enemy off balance."
I've never had to defend a fixed position.
That's a whole different game.
"You're just gonna have to learn it fast, because that's what we're doing."
We're defending this fixed position.
Until chief finds his eye of Jupiter.
"Okay, so you want us to risk our lives for something that you haven't even found yet ?"
!
"Listen, Sam, I'm not even sure it exists."
But I don't have to tell you every little godsdamn detail.
You know what you have to explain to me ?
"The major's in charge on this one, okay ?"
Okay ?
"Well, I certainly wouldn't want to step between you and your major."
"In my thought, that went really well."
- He'll do it.
- He'd better.
I miss Nicky.
- Do you think he's okay ?
"- Yes, he's fine."
- He's on Galactica.
He's fine.
I'm thrilled you'll have me.
Please toast to my beautiful bride   and her fantastic family who have welcomed me so kindly -
"- Jørgen, Helene, the twins..."
Cheers.
"Christian's lovely, don't you think?"
He's nice.
- He's so cute.
- Cute?
Maybe.
- I dated him before Anna.
- Was he your boyfriend?
But Anna gets whatever she wants.
It's not traditional for the bride to give a speech   but everything's gone so well so far.
I know Mom's waiting for something to go horribly wrong.
I'll do it now so that you can relax.
"My speech isn't for you, Christian."
I love you and you know it.
I couldn't be happier than I am today.
And don't worry.
I'll pay back the 1000 kroner.
But I'd like to thank Mom and Dad.
"Mom, I know we argue a lot now and then   but you are the best, the most loving   and the most loyal person I have ever met."
And Dad...
When I turned 18 a few years ago   you had to tell me that you weren't my real father... genetically.
You told me how Mom had known another man   and we didn't talk for almost six months.
It wasn't until I met Christian that I began to understand   why you did what you did.
"You did it to protect me, so I'd have a mother and father like everyone else."
I've had a dad.
You've been the best father anyone could ever wish for.
"And if I could have chosen, I would have chosen you, Dad   whether you're my father or not."
So I would like to say thank you.
Thank you for today and for everything.
And they let Franz go!
But you gotta hand it to 'em ― they both stood their ground.
The lawyer argued for two hours that Reinhold was marginally retarded.
Reinhold will have to pay him for that!
A pretty penny!
- Did they swear you in?
- Sure.
- On the Bible?
"- No, not that."
Good.
What do they want?
Either they want our picture or they're new recruits.
Here he comes.
We've gotta help Franz out with some money.
He won't take anything from us anymore.
It's all behind you.
You're rid of those guys now.
And you're rid of me too.
"Everyone has to find his own way, right?"
I'll find work.
And you have to tell yourself you just got out of Tegel.
Life is just beginning for you.
"Mieze is gone, and my arm is gone."
"Come on, don't give up now!"
You've always said you don't work with your arms but with ―
"Your kisser, ladies and gentlemen!"
"Shut those honorable kissers, because here comes the main attraction!"
Berlin pricks up its ears and holds its breath.
Even that policeman's arm hangs suspended in the air.
We've all been knocked on our rear end at some point.
"But it's stomach in, chest out, and back on your feet, or you end up in a pauper's grave!"
"Many among us have stared down grenades and shrapnel, stared right in their eyes."
"She broke down all reserve in no time, and looked after us like her family."
And why not?
"After all, you are a blood relative."
I guess you're right.
And about the agency of the canning factory.
I got the impression that Clark wants me to work there.
"And of course, the post will be a good one, I imagine."
I'm thinking about it.
"Since it is simply unbearable to stay a clerk forever, you know."
That's true.
"Well, now, don't forget about me when the time comes, all right?"
Now let's have a drink.
Thank you.
What miserable men you are.
What is eating inside your heads?
You're just like beggars.
I am only going because... this man Suzujiro is my big brother.
"And mind you, I am not going to see him because he is rich."
"Everybody, come over here!"
What is it?
It's a beautiful moonlit night.
Let's enjoy the cool evening outside!
Grandpa used to love to watch the moon.
He always said watching the moon washed his mind clean.
He often stood in the garden and looked at the moon.
"Grandma is certainly a lady of firm character, isn't she?"
"No, she's just old-fashioned."
"In short, she has an antiquated mind."
"But still, the way she talks is worthy of an educator."
"I'm sure Grandpa was, also."
They were both schoolteachers.
Both of them had strict morals.
"Let's say for instance, my poor, sweet mother comes in with symptoms like Mrs. Booth's."
What would you say?
Stroke?
Maybe she mixed up her meds.
"- Your poor, sweet mother?"
- Yeah.
I would have ruled out a stroke.
My next guess would be a form of dementia.
"But if your poor, sweet mother is anything like Ms. Booth, she'd refuse a full exam."
"And why would his poor, sweet mother do that?"
"Because she'd say she knew what was wrong, she'd seen it before, and she'd be fine."
"And what would happen next to my poor, sweet mother?"
- You'd let her leave?
- Not alone.
Ms. Booth couldn't follow simple directions to the washroom.
"At first, she wouldn't let me call anybody."
But then she finally gave me her daughter's number.
- Laura.
"- Yes, she said she'd come."
"After two hours, I finally called her again."
"She got real snippy, you know."
Told me she had a rehearsal and couldn't get away.
Ended up calling a car service.
And you're sure there was no one else that Ms. Booth asked you to call?
No.
She said she didn't have anybody else.
And her daughter was always too busy.
I felt sorry for her.
"- Thank you, doc."
- My pleasure.
"Well, whatever is wrong with her, maybe it's what's behind the panic that made her kill Laura."
"Well, she said she knew what she had."
"Because every time we chase down a bad guy on foot, you drive."
Ah.
"Well, I am kind of a genius that way."
- Who's the hottie on deck?
- He's cute.
"- Our latest client, and he's engaged."
- Of course he is.
"Charlie, we're all here."
"- Morning, angels."
"- Good morning, Charlie."
I'd like you to meet Scott Foster.
He's here because his fiancee disappeared off a cruise ship.
It was supposed to be a 3-day trip.
Miami to the Bahamas.
That was two weeks ago.
Your fiancee went on a cruise without you?
She's working a story.
She's a journalist.
- And what was she chasing on the high seas?
- She never talks about her work.
"The cruise line registers their ships in the Bahamas, which puts this case out of American jurisdiction."
Cruise line give you any leads?
"They've been incredibly helpful, but the fact is, they don't have any answers, and there's no evidence of foul play aboard their ship."
"If she's alive, I need to find her, and if she's not- let's just stay positive."
Right now she's just a missing person.
"Scott, before we take your case, there is one last piece of business we need to settle internally."
You'll hear from us.
Thank you.
"All right, we'll walk you out."
Right this way.
Internal business?
"Charlie, don't leave us hanging."
It was everything he had.
I'd get the rest as soon as he got out.
Where'd he say the rest of the money was coming from?
I don't know.
"He told me was there was a lot of it waiting for him on the outside, but in order to get it, he needed to get out today."
"Skeet, I'm Detective Williams, this is Commander McGarrett."
We hear you and Walton Dawkins were neighbors.
For four and a half years.
Warden says you used to be pretty tight.
"Well, in the non-biblical sense, if you dig what I'm saying."
"So, what happened?"
Why the beef?
I didn't appreciate him trying to gut me with a shiv last week.
He said I was asking too many questions.
Questions have anything to do about why he bounced today?
It's possible I may have some pertinent information.
"But, uh, you're gonna have to play me for it."
- Play you?
That's right.
"You win, I'll tell you everything I know."
What's to stop me taking that and beating it out of you?
Bring it.
"They got better food at the hospital, anyway."
"What the hell you got to threatened me with, man?"
More lockup time?
Okay.
Might be able to help you shave some time off your sentence.
"- I'm doing double life, gimp."
- Excuse me?
"You got a busted ear too, man?"
"I'm on permanent vacation, no parole."
You can shave ten years off my time but I ain't never getting out.
And you can accommodate it.
You look jolly.
"You see girls, this is what happens when you go poor."
"You'd think that you'd get thinner but you don't, it's weird, it's the opposite."
I've got an interview!
"Oh, Jenny love you're getting to be an expert at these."
"Oh, I've got a feeling about this one."
"I put my CV in this morning, they rang me this afternoon to say that they wanted to see me!"
"What's the position, poppet?"
Practice manager at the doctor's.
"Oh, practice manager."
And presumably if you do well in that then later you'll have a go at being the actual manager.
"No, Mum."
"Mum, practice manager means running a practice."
"Yeah, NHS management."
Yeah I'm donating my skills to the public ***
I'm not Barack Obama post-Harvard.
"Oh, hat's great news, Jen."
"Still rather you than me, all that red tape."
The only person I answer to is Nick Pope.
"Nick, you're in my seat."
"Oh, sorry."
And as I'd be earning I reckon we'd be able to rent somewhere of our own.
"Mommy, what's rent?"
"Nothing you'll ever need to worry about, kitten."
"So you might be moving on then, poppet."
Well let's not get ahead of ourselves.
It could go the way of the others.
I think it's brilliant.
"Go for it, Mum."
"Thanks, Becky."
Go for it!
"The point is, the times I actually felt okay with it was when the person showed they cared and let me talk through it."
"Okay, hold on."
"So the girl just rode by and shouted,"
"""I don't want to see you anymore,"""
and kept going?
Okay.
You tried to teach me how to get the girl?
Now I'm going to teach you how to break up with the girl.
The right way.
How are you going to possibly do that?
"With my proven method, which is..."
"Hold on, give me an hour."
Overthinking!
"Are you coaching me through a breakup, or is Jason Bourne on the loose again?"
The reason I overthink things is because I care about what other people are feeling.
That's what you need to learn: empathy.
"Okay, now, we don't have the time to turn you into a fully evolved human being, so I'm going to teach you how to appear to be one with the help of..."
Please do not say role-playing.
"I am Amy, you are you."
"Hey, Jack!"
"Ugh, payroll!"
Boop!
"What are we doing tonight, sweetheart?"
"Um, I'm breaking up with you."
This isn't working.
Boop!
Very direct.
But you want to leave her feeling good.
"Well, what do you suggest?"
Maybe some light over-the-clothes stuff before I bounce?
"Oh, my God, things are a mess in payroll, my mom's sciatica is acting up, and now you are leaving me?"
[fake crying] [whispers]:
# Go with the status quo #
# Go with the status # # 'cause that's where we should go... #
It says this D.V.D. sold more copies than any D.V.D. ever made.
They just released part three in theaters and it made 80 million opening weekend.
"Well, I'm out, guys."
"If this is what's cool now, I think I'm done."
I no longer have any connection to this world.
I'm gonna go home and kill myself.
"Good-bye, friends."
"I don't care how popular being like these kids becomes,"
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it either-
- Kenny?
No fucking way I'm doing it.
"All right, we promise?"
We have to swear to each other right now we'll never become this.
- I swear.
- I swear too.
"Okay, good."
"What happened, I thought you were gonna kill yourself."
I tried.
Went to sleep in my Mom's car in the garage with the engine turned on.
But you didn't die?
"Freakin' hybrids, man."
They just don't do the trick anymore.
"All right, kids in seats, kids in seats."
Today we are going to discuss the Berlin Wall.
This was a wall in Germany that actually separated the communist east side and the democratic west side.
# East side west side #
# Whatever side that you're on #
# As long as we care about each other #
# We can still all have some fun... #
Not a stick nor a spar.
"Looks like we're on our own, then."
What happened to them?
Where are they?
They must have sailed.
"If there are no British ships, there will be French ones."
We should go.
- We will.
- Back to Gibraltar as I suggested?
"- Bring her about, Mr. Scott-Padget."
"- Yes, sir."
"Boatswain, stand by to wear ship!"
Mr. Ponsonby I want you to send Crawford into the tops for two days.
"For punishment, sir?"
Do as I tell you.
I wish to speak to the ship's company informally.
"Muster all hands, if you please."
- All hands to the after well deck!
- Come on!
Jump to it!
Are we heading back to Gibraltar?
We'll stay on this course for the time being.
"Well, lads, I've got some explaining to do."
We seemed to have lost the fleet.
I want you to know the orders for the fleet and for us which are to escort a convoy of timber ships from the far side of Italy back to England.
"Timber to build ships of the line, and frigates."
More like her.
Defiant.
We must go to the place of rendezvous and see if the convoy is there.
"If it isn't, well, we tried."
"If it is, we'll bring it back in the face of Frenchmen, Spaniards or anyone else who tries to stop us."
- Back to your duties.
Open this gate!
Goodness!
What's going on?
That conniving bastard!
What is the meaning of this?
!
We are looking for a criminal who not only embezzled government property but stole valuable goods intended for His Majesty's use.
Begin the search!
Don't be like that.
You can't do this to a friend.
Go to the tavern if you can move around.
He said he'd be there waiting for you.
I think you should listen to Master Bang.
What are you talking about?
We're not letting Soon-shin go anywhere.
I think Master Bang's concerns are valid.
I think he worries too much.
Kyun...
"You know what he went though to stay in the institute, and he doesn't have much time before the exam."
Who's out there?
"Soon-shin, this is you!"
What's wrong?
It's Baron Huh's doing.
I will go to the authorities at once and reveal the truth!
No.
This warrant with your sketch means that they have acquired solid evidence against you.
But still...
Haven't you seen what they have done to your friend?
They will make up a crime if you are innocent.
"But, Sung-ryong..."
You must flee for now and find a way to prove your innocence.
Darn this rotten government!
You said it yourself.
We did it once.
No.
You helped us make a baby.
Wait.
What?
Are you serious?
I just got back from the doctor.
I'm... pregnant.
You're gonna be a father.
"You, too."
"So, even with the added ingredient of suggestion, our numbers are about the same."
"Maybe a little better, but not better enough."
"Well, a little better is not nothing."
It was a nice dream-- a cologne scientifically proven to attract women.
"First of all, it should be marketed towards women, not men."
"A perfume that a woman could put on to help her feel more sexual, perhaps even awaken a whole part of herself that's been dormant or repressed."
"You know, it is what's happening out there in the real world-- a sexual awakening."
That's exactly right.
"So, if we could tailor this research and turn it into a perfume"
- for women...
- But--
Give women a sense of power so they can take charge of their own lives.
"""Do I want to feel sexy and aroused tonight?"
"Yes, I do."""
"Now, that-- that would be exciting."
"Yes, it would if it were true, but it's not."
We don't have the numbers.
"Virginia, I'm sorry."
I think my work here is done.
What are you guys talking about?
- Mrs. Tate.
We're planning the registry for the most important day of our life and he just leaves.
Maybe he's just feeling a bit of...
"A bit of what, anxiety?"
Can't believe you're defending him.
What?
"No, no, no, no."
I'm not defending him.
You just don't understand.
You can't possibly comprehend what it feels like inside of me right now because you've never been here.
"That's, that's true."
"I used to think about what it'd be like to live your life, Dale."
Just walk in your shoes.
Nobody expects anything from you.
They don't.
No one expects anything from me?
Uh-uh. 'Cause you don't have parents expecting babies... and marriages and perfect husbands.
It's really hard.
"That's true, but it doesn't mean I want to end up alone."
"Tell me something, Dale."
Am I expecting too much?
"Is wanting my fiancée to be excited about our wedding, is that too much?"
"I don't know, Jill."
"Back at St. Mary's, for our first communion... the biggest deal was finding out who you were gonna get paired up with."
I dreamed of walking down the aisle with Billy Dobson hand in hand.
"But, no such luck."
"He was paired with Jill, and I ended up with what's his face who picked his nose all the time."
I wonder if I'll ever get to walk down the aisle with a Billy Dobson of my own.
"Ah, is this your parents?"
Yeah.
That's them.
And is this you with your mother?
Yeah.
"Dad, from school?"
"Actually, and I don't think you know this, Dylan."
I first saw you at the same party where you met Ben.
"I even pointed you out to Ben, because I took one look at you and I was totally smitten."
But Ben Boykewich moved in on you before I even had a chance.
Huh.
Interesting.
Yeah.
We should go.
"No, we shouldn't."
"If you were my daughter, I wouldn't just let you walk out of the house with some guy I don't know."
Ask me anything you want.
And I will try to answer honestly and to the best of my ability.
Would you like a piece of cake?
Honestly?
Yes.
I have a real sweet tooth.
What's your favorite dessert?
Whatever you like to bake.
What does your father do?
He's a male nurse.
He works in assisted care.
He wanted to be a doctor but his dad died when he was young and he had to take care of my grandmother and that's how he got into the field.
He's very patient.
He likes older people.
Our culture is very respectful of the elderly.
What would your family say if someday you wanted to marry someone outside of your culture?
I've already asked.
"We've discussed it at length, and my parents feel that matters of the heart should be decided by the heart."
"Okay, if we're going to get to the 7:30 show, we really should be going."
But he didn't get his cake.
Let me get the cake.
"You can't do that, jim!"
We got to get some of his money to pay for this presidential suite!
Jim's right.
You couldn't chase him away with a cannon.
"Here, you board of directors get into this room- all 12 of you."
"And, nick, talk out loud about all the boats we're going to build."
Open the transom so old drew can hear you.
All right.
Now try it out.
"Gentlemen, today we are gathered here for the burial of daniel drew."
"How's that, jim?"
That'll fix him.
Ha!
Well?
I reckon you ain't too busy to see your uncle daniel drew.
Uncle who?
Drew.
"Oh, yes, drew."
"Well, i'm very busy."
I've got my board of directors waiting for this report in the next room.
"Within the next 10 months, gentlemen, we'll have in operation 6 of the finest steamboats ever built in america!"
"He have not only the unanimous support of the press and public, but the financial backing of the biggest men in new york."
"Ah, very interesting."
"Proceed, my good man, proceed."
"Oh, won't you sit down?"
"The trouble is that these two great cities have condemned the intolerable ""take it and like it"" policy of daniel drew."
You must excuse them.
They don't know you're here.
"Ahem, ahem, mr."
"Boyd, i would like to ask a question."
"Yes, mr."
"Baxter, what can i do for you?"
I keep that to remind me never to go back.
I just never expected that that world would would find me here.
"- Hey, look, Doc, I'm not them."
"- Oh, yeah?"
"No, I'm not."
"When is the last time you cared about something except yourself, hot rod?"
You name me one time and I will take it all back.
Uh-huh.
I didn't think so.
"These are good folk around here, who care about one another."
I don't want 'em depending on someone they can't count on.
"Oh, like you?"
You've been here how long and your friends don't even know who you are?
Who's caring about only himself?
Just finish that road and get outta here!
Will you turn that disrespectful junk off?
"Respect the classics, man."
Ah...
He's done.
He must've finished it while we was all sleeping'.
Good riddance.
He's gone?
"Well, we wouldn't want him to miss that race of his."
"- Oh, dude, are you crying?"
- No!
I'm happy!
I don't have to watch him every second of the day anymore!
I'm glad he's gone!
What's wrong with Red?
"Oh, he's just sad 'cause you left town and went to your big race to win the Piston Cup that you've always dreamed about your whole life and get that big ol' sponsor and that fancy helicopter you was talkin' about."
Wait a minute!
I knowed you wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
- This is ridiculous.
"If he says he's ready for trial, the court takes him at his word."
Callie:
This is a stunt.
Leonard:
"Your Honor, he is alleging negligence, which necessitates more discovery with respect to duty of care."
This will take time.
"Okay, let's forget negligence."
We'll just go with wrongful act and fraud.
Excuse me?
You're willing to waive the claims of negligence against Borns Tech?
That's correct.
That's your strongest cause of action.
You open yourself up to malpractice.
"Well, instead of going with an innocent mistake, we're going to go with a conspiracy."
You're willing to waive the negligence claim?
I just did waive it.
They say he killed himself.
We say he didn't.
We say Borns Tech had him working on an illegal weapon that blew him up.
It's very simple.
"Your Honor, could I have a moment to, uh--"
- Please.
- ...speak with my... people?
"Okay, thoughts?"
"Nope, I don't like it."
What are you talking about?
There is no evidence of any intentional acts or of a cover-up.
"If he's willing to go with wrongful acts and fraud, we win."
Mm-mm.
- Ahem.
- Counsel?
So do I.
I hope we can preserve it without any more Shilohs.
"They say the slaughter was so fierce on both sides, you could walk across the field on dead bodies like stepping stones."
"How would you like to put a stop to that, Pittenger?"
"Could we, with what we're doing?"
Maybe we can.
"[Pittenger] We managed to be on the Friday train, headed south."
"So far, we were lucky."

[all soldiers] Five!
- [standing soldier] How many?
- [all soldiers] Ten!
[standing soldier] That's more like it!
One company of Southerners armed with popguns could run a whole regiment of Yankees clean out of the country!
[standing soldier]
- Am I right?
[all soldiers]
- Right!
- Gettin' off?
- No.
- Thought maybe I'd get your seat.
"- No, just stretching."
They will have to destroy the evidence.
"And that, I'm afraid, includes us."
I don't think I feel very well.
I hope nothing's been broken.
So do I.
It's still on the Ortega.
We've got to get back to them.
Now I know I don't feel very well.
"If we could get back onto the flight deck, how long would it take to finish repairs?"
No time at all.
It's virtually all done.
"In flight we'd stand some sort of chance, like this we're a sitting target."
We would have to burn through the flight deck door.
"And if we did, she's armed, remember."
She could still hold us off.
Then we have to get her to come out.
Well she's hardly likely to do that.
Oh yes she is.
- Visual.
- Confirmed.
"There, there she is."
How long before we're in teleport range?
23.16 minutes.
"We're getting another reading, look!"
Another ship.
It must be coming to collect the neutrotope.
"Zen, can we get there first?"
Liberator will be in teleport range 3 minutes before the unidentified ship makes contact with the Ortega.
[MUFFLED LASER BLASTS AND SCREAMING]
"You'd better get her out of here, I really rather enjoyed that."
Teleport range will be achieved in one minute.
"Come on, Vila."
"Go throw Mom one of your ""puppy dog in a thunderstorm"" looks."
Get her to change her mind.
They made it clear.
I have to obey Mrs. Bloom's request.
This isn't right.
I can't just stand back and do nothing.
"Kyle, do I detect defiance?"
Genius joins the dark side.
I've got a list of rules I've been dying for you to break.
I don't want to break any rules.
I won't have to.
I'll do exactly what Mrs. Bloom asked me to do.
"Atta boy, Kyle."
Take a stand.
Why are your feet on my bed?
There were still ways to contact Amanda without seeing or speaking to her.
* I miss
* Feeling you there by my side... *
I could easily circumvent Mrs. Bloom without leaving my own house.
But it seemed she could find ways to thwart me just as easily.
"If electronic messages weren't getting through, there would be no way for me to send a note or a letter without Mrs. Bloom intercepting it."
I couldn't see or speak to Amanda.
The written word was no longer an option.
But there were still a few notes I could send her way.
"I hoped this message would get through, and she would at least know I was thinking about her."
I was just trying- I know what you were doing.
I think you better come in now.
What?
"You want my music now, too?"
You've already confiscated my phone and my computer.
I know this is hard for you to understand-
That you're keeping me prisoner?
"It's ""maybe""."
Directive is now required.
"Jenna, stand by to feed all power through to the main drive when the force wall is down."
Ready.
"Gan, deactivate the force wall."
Deactivating.
Why?
For what reason?
Perhaps Sonheim was still trying to cover up.
Mandrian knew about him and threatened to expose him.
Or perhaps he went into the filter plant while Sonheim was sabotaging the equipment?
But why damage the filter?
What possible reason could he have for delaying the flight still further?
How bad is it?
The damage was minor.
I've got Levett working on it.
We've locked him in the storage hold.
He seems quiet enough.
Has he said anything more?
Nothing new.
"He claims he went in and found Mandrian dead, picked up the knife, that's where I came in."
He still says he didn't kill him.
I believe him.
But I saw him with a dagger in his hand!
But you didn't see him use it.
"I didn't see Mandrian die either, but I know he's dead."
I've just spent the last ten minutes in the filter plant looking for something that should be there but isn't.
The cable that was damaged carries a high energy charge.
"In order to cut it, he would need a laser knife or an insulated saw."
Neither of which were there.
"Then, somebody else was the saboteur?"
Yes.
"But you know, you know how men do."
"You know, a lot of men don't get their stuff together until they 50, you know?"
You know.
You know what I'm saying?
They go back to school.
"Now they want to get their degree and shit, and the wife's sitting there like,"
"""Now you wanna do it, nigga?"
"""You wanna do that shit now?"
"""I done been telling your ass for 20 years."
"You wanna do that shit now?"""
"My pop is cool, man."
I just think that sometimes he puts blame on other people for his shortcomings.
"Which is cool, you know?"
We all do it.
"Like, every time I go home and he has a bad day he's like,"
"""Ugh."""
"I was like, ""Dad, what's wrong?"""
"""These crackers keep holding me down, son."""
"I said, ""Daddy, the crackers ain't holding you down."""
"""That associate's degree is holding you down."
"""Maybe you need to go to school a couple more years and upgrade."""
"'Cause an associate's degree is basically like the college saying,"
"""Yeah, we associate with you."
"We just don't fuck with you,"" you know what I'm saying?"
"It's real stuff, man."
But it's about the parenting.
Okay?
"You ain't gotta whup your kids, you know?"
"Change your personality, scare the hell out of them."
That's what it's about.
"It's about scaring them, putting that fear in 'em."
You ever ran away from your damn mom or your dad in the mall?
Not me.
Where were you on Thursday?
- On a date.
- With who?
I didn't catch her name.
But she wasn't as hot as you.
"Holt's blood is on the victim, he's got priors and his alibi is just as worthless as he is."
"In other words, Mr. Holt just became our prime suspect."
Now all we have to do is shore up motive.
I've been working on that.
"So far, I haven't been able to find a single connection between him and Nelson."
And I doubt u will.
Ribosomal analysis shows that the sample of Johnny Holt's blood that we found on our vic is at least three months old.
While he was still in Sing Sing.
Sid found the dried blood on Nelson's throat.
Said he must've been hit there with a pipe or club.
The blood must've been on the murder weapon.
Transferred onto Nelson when he was killed.
I think we just found our connection.
No.
I've never seen him.
Are you sure?
He might've been an acquaintance of your husband's?
Absolutely not.
What about this boy?
I don't recognize this child at all.
"And to save you a question, I have no idea what these pictures are doing on Vince's computer."
Ever since this e-mail thing came out the phone's been ringing nonstop.
Someone put a pile of dog feces on my doormat this morning.
"Mrs. Nelson, did your husband teach anywhe else where he might've been in contact with younger boys?"
After school program?
The local Y?
You like scotch?
I do.
Here.
Cheers.
"We're both healers, you and me."
We help people end their suffering.
Give them a moment of euphoria and take away their pain.
"I thought he just wanted to sell them pain relief, you know?"
"Weed, morphine."
I guess he saw an opportunity.
To kill people?
Must be an entrepreneurial genius.
"Well, if you think about it, he... he is."
"I mean, apparently, people are willing to pay top dollar for a good death."
"You know, it's true, what you said."
You never forget your first injection.
Mine was Yvonne.
ALS.
You know what that is?
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis.
"You shouldn't underestimate me, Mary."
Yet you didn't... you didn't think to mention any of this when we were in this very room together.
"Okay, you see, the way I saw it, I had two options."
One was to tell the police...
tell you that I'm a drug addict.
"Two, wear the wire, and I could prove that"
Mary and I are just ordinary end-of-life counselors.
"You lose all control, limb by limb, organ by organ... until you can't breathe."
Is that where you come in?
To take back control?
Or else the monster wins.
You said that was saline.
- There's Winslet.
- She's not coming off the Supreme Court.
Laine Hanson is attractive.
She's a looker.
The mere fact that she was a Republican means that she can't be too far to the left.
It's a perfect pedigree.
We can't get you in by convincing him you're the right man for the job.
We have to convince him that she's wrong.
"Once we do that, you're in."
"And Toliver, he's as much as told me..."
I'm not going for a low blow.
It's not my way.
You won't have to.
We have to go after her.
We have to make her wade in her own blood.
- Who did you say you were?
- I'm Makerowitz.
- Makerowitz.
- I'm sorry.
That doesn't mean much to me.
- Web got somebody...
- A friend of the Hathaway campaign.
Who is footing the not-too-unimpressive bill of Mr. Makerowitz.
Private citizen wants to do their own investigation...
What exactly are you trying to find out?
"Campaign irregularities, bribes?"
- Isn't that the FBI's responsibility?
"- Yes, it is."
But the FBI would not find anything.
All of her money is tied up in blind trusts.
"The kind of improprieties you're talking about, I think that only helps her."
"Personally, I think the nation would be relieved to know that just because she's a woman..."
We were told Kevin Grey dated her before she left him for your dad.
"Detective Clayton, I like to think you knew my father very well."
He had a girl in every bar in town.
It was hard for me to keep track.
Is there any reason why you would want to protect Kevin Grey?
Not that I can think of.
Miss Lau has answered your questions.
I'd like to draw this to a close.
"Miss Lau, I did know your father well."
And you know what I smelt on him the last time I saw him?
Fear.
- Fear?
"- He knew, didn't he?"
He knew he was going to be killed.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.
Freddie wasn't a man that scared easily but someone had him on the run.
"If you say so, Harry."
"Yet you - you seem completely unaffected through all of this, cool as a cucumber."
- Why is that?
- I don't like the direction you're taking this.
Almost as if you knew you were going to be left untouched.
"- Unless you charge my client, we are leaving."
- What did they promise you?
Miss Lau?
"You're playing a very dangerous game here, Harry."
"The truth is, you're in no position to be questioning me about any of this."
And why is that?
- What's that?
- What's the matter with it?
"My father died very soon after he called in your debt, Harry Clayton."
And you were there in the casino the night it happened.
"Okay, we're all gonna get through this, okay, mom?"
"And i gotta go, all right?"
"Mama, what's wrong?"
You don't look good.
"Marcus, what really happened between you and regina?"
- Oh.
"- I know you let her go to make a point,"
But couldn't you have held onto her
And made your point in another way?
"Your family has fallen apart, son."
I did what i thought was best at the time.
Regina knows how i feel about her.
But our marriage wasn't important enough
For her to make the compromises she had to for the family.
It was all about her career and not about us.
"She wanted more, so i let her go and find it."
How long and how hard can you hold onto someone
Who is selfish and wants to be free?
"She's a grown woman, mom."
I can't hold onto her against her will.
"I understand, marcus."
"But whatever you do, don't let her divorce you."
Try and hold onto her for all of our sakes.
The ball is in her court and she knows it.
She's always known that i'd take her back.
She just has to say the word and i'll act as if none of this ever happened.
"I hate seeing her this way, but i can't make her want me"
Or want a life with me.
"I love her with all my heart,"
But i can't stand in her way if she wants to be free.
Okay?
"But really, i gotta go, mom."
What did you find out about Kim Yang?
"Lord Dangje, the regent's father, is looking after the new governor."
Is there a reason why?
"Kim Yang is a very competent man, who has risen in the ranks very rapidly."
He was revered by the people under his rule.
Some have even built a monument in his honor.
He seems to be an extraordinary man.
It would be wise to make an ally of him.
"Captain, it is I, Tae-bong."
Come in.
What is it?
The new governor is headed for Chunghae.
Why is he going to Chunghae?
I haven't found that out yet.
The scout ship is ready to set sail.
Search the waters near Yongeum Island.
You will be able to find Yum Moon's hideout.
He could attack any minute.
Be very careful during your mission.
"Yes, sir."
Set sail!
What division do the troops belong to?
"That's the flag of the Sajageum division, the Mujinju governor's guards."
My lord.
What brings you out in this cold weather?
The new governor is here to pay his respects to you.
What brings you to Chunghae?
I have been appointed governor of Mujinju by your grace.
I came to pay my respects.
You came all this way just to pay your respects?
"If you have the time, you should use it to carry out your duty."
You didn't seem very friendly to the governor.
"Kaman, you gotta let me go."
"Please, let me go."
What do you want?
I'll give you anything you want.
You want money?
You want a job?
"Just don't do anything stupid, man, all right?"
Damn it!
"Come on, man!"
"[Garcia] Okay, from the look of Kaman Scott's early years, he was on a fast track to be some kind of hoodlum, bad boy, super convict, but something happened in 2004 that made him change his evil tune"
"'cause then there's no arrests, there's no suspicions."
"There's no sign of rehab, but he totally cleaned up."
Maybe that's when he met someone.
Has he ever been arrested with a man named Tommy Proctor?
"Yeah, once."
"Uh, 2002."
Yikes.
And then they collided again in 2005.
"Like, literally collided."
"Kaman was in an accident, and his car blew up."
"Well, there's your gas accelerant."
"[Garcia] He was hit by that guy, Tommy Proctor."
And there's your revenge.
Twist of fate.
The life he left behind came back to haunt him.
"So Tommy walks away without a scratch, and Kaman suffers a ton of third-degree burns, had a boatload of skin grafts, was in a coma for a couple of months, lost his apartment..."
"Oh, and then there's that guy."
His landlord was Tony Torrell.
So we were right.
He does have a revenge list.
"What about family, friends, acquaintances?"
"No, that Kaman is a lone wolf."
What happened to you?
"I did try, Clark."
"In fact, when we first met, you inspired me."
"All I wanted was to be your friend, but... you turned your back on me."
So you're the person you are today because of me.
I tried to be your friend.
But all you care about is power and control.
This is Smallville!
"Meteor freaks, alien ships, cryptic symbols!"
These threats are real.
Someone had to take control.
Someone has to protect the world.
Listen to yourself.
"You're so caught up in your own delusions, you've lost track of reality."
Have I?
Then let's talk about something you can't deny.
"After years of pleading with my father to show me some compassion, he turned to you, with open arms."
"What would a worldly billionaire have in common, with a simple farm boy?"
Maybe he just knew he could trust me.
Of course.
Everyone can trust Clark Kent.
You're the perfect son.
So why did Jonathan Kent always seem so stressed?
Was raising the perfect son really that much work?
I wonder how much of a strain it put on his heart.
Are you blaming me for my father's death?
Are you?
!
"You're the guilty one, not me."
"And this time, you're gonna own up to what you've done."
I know you killed Lionel.
- Who's delusional now?
Your money?
"My five thousand, that you owe me."
You probably mean this here.
You glue money to the wall?
Is that five thousand?
Yes.
You owe me money and glue it to the wall?
Are you insane?
"Toni, look at it like this."
"My office is your place of pilgrimage,"
You can always come here and beg forgiveness for your greed.
Stop this bullshit!
Euro-Basilica!
"From now on, we'll call it Euro-Basilica!"
I'll have you sent to the insane asylum.
You along with your loony sister and the other idiots too.
Should I explain how I really see it?
"So my dear Franz, I'll give you untill the end of the week to get these bills off the wall."
"Otherwise I'll call the police, and I'll call the press."
"That way the whole world can see the idiots, with whom I have to co-exist."
I also have to co-exist with you... with your America fetish and the stench of your bar... and the constantly changing waitresses bitching to us that you won't pay them.
"Actually, I should bash your face in for all this."
But my father and your father are brothers.
"Well, I'll come up with a plan."
Think up something.
"And you darling, come up with a plan as well."
I already have.
Try getting them off with steam.
Max the Hunter
Max the Hunter
- Excuse me.
What?
"Michael, you might want to double-check your head count."
"Hey, Sam."
Everything all right?
"You know, Mike, uh..."
"The last time I kissed my lady, she was crying."
I left her to be interrogated by the CIA so we could escape.
I'm sorry.
We're getting the passports.
We need to know if you're coming.
"Yeah, well, I got to think about that, Mike."
I'll let you know.
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
I can't believe you're going to build a mosque.
I know.
It's surreal.
"So, what's your first step going to be?"
"You know, I got so caught up in the excitement,"
I didn't actually think how we're going to do it.
"OK, well, you're going to need a location and permit,"
- So why don't you talk to Ann?
"- Oh, that's a good idea."
"I will explain to her how the idea came about, hmm..."
"Through an unlikely friendship with a chicken,"
I was given a sign that told me I should build a mosque.
Maybe leave out the part about the chicken 'cause it's a little weird.
"You know, I'm going to go see Ann now and see if she's got a few minutes to spare."
So you're probably wondering why I'm here.
I'm wondering what's taking you so long to get to the point of why you're here.
- I want to build a mosque in Mercy.
- Uh-huh.
"Technically, I know we have a mosque in the church already, but you know that was supposed to be temporary anyway."
- For what?
For snatching bodies and selling the pieces.
"Look, I didn't steal anything."
I work in the mortuary as st.
Mark's medical center.
I oversee the anatomical procurement services.
"Yeah, they confirmed that."
Okay.
So we provide specimens to schools and researchers.
It's illegal to profit from the sale of body parts.
"Look, we only charge for their transportation, storage, and processing."
"It is a vital, legal service."
And it's all above board.
"As long as the bodies are donated, not paid for."
Who donated the body in the back of your van?
"I don't know, but I can get you the paperwork."
You have any paperwork on Manette Combs?
/ Who?
Manette wasn't an organ donor.
She never willed her body to science.
And you bought her corpse from Mark Mogan at the Brooklyn M.E.'s office.
"Chopped her up, sold her parts."
And then dumped what you couldn't sell.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not what you told me before.
Make sure he's discreet.
"You see something you think I'll like, give me a call."
"What, you set me up?"
Her face ring a bell?
"We found her head, her arm, and a leg."
Where's the rest of her?
Ask my lawyer.
My savior.
"I send you out to find more evidence against Reinhardt, and this is what you bring back?"
We supposed to apologize?
"Dental resin or no, Reinhardt is still the most viable suspect."
And that bite is the most damning piece of evidence.
I don't know what to do with this.
And I don't want it falling in the wrong hands.
"I'll put it in my bottom drawer, counselor."
"You want it, you let me know."
I don't relish the day.
Fake teeth.
Isn't that a little theatrical?
Gillian Booth is theatrical.
A mother killing her grown daughter is hard to take.
I agree.
But the evidence is pointing that way.
Laura was trying to get the love of her mother's life fired.
Philip's next job was gonna be out of state.
Gillian might have freaked out that he'd be gone for good.
"Ah, sure."
Angry enough at her daughter to lose control?
"Yeah, if her adrenaline was pumping in anger."
Anger or panic.
Panic?
/ She's not someone who handles surprises well.
Take these subway maps we found in her dressing room.
She marked her route from the opera to her apartment with a highlighter.
And she used a different color to mark the route to her daughter's house.
And she did the same thing on every single map.
She's afraid of getting lost.
Marking all these maps?
That's not afraid.
"Okay, what if we both have to use the bathroom at the same time and there's only two stalls available and they're only right next to each other?"
I'll just hold it.
Do I need to remind you how lucky we are that they're not pressing charges?
"Oh, come on, it was just a joke."
A joke?
"Yes, I didn't think it would be taken this seriously."
"Dad, humor's very subjective, okay?"
"I mean, we're talking multiple levels of interpretation here."
"Okay, well, how exactly am I supposed to interpret the stolen prison transport van, huh?"
We filled the tank!
Move!
It's not just this.
"Although, a restraining order is a new low that I didn't think that you would reach quite this soon."
It's everything on top of it.
"The completely bizarre behavior, the late nights coming home, having to beg Mr. Harris for you to make up that chemistry test that you missed."
I missed a chemistry test?
"Really, Scott?"
Really?
I have to ground you.
I am grounding you.
You are grounded.
What about work?
Fine...
Other than work.
And no TV.
The TV's broken.
Then no computer.
I need the computer for school.
"Then no, uh... no Stiles."
What... no Stiles?
No Stiles!
And no more car privileges.
Come in.
You look positively orange with loneliness.
"No, I don't see that catching on at all."
What are you doing?
I'm working on my three-person chess game.
"Oh, cool."
Can I play?
It's three-person chess.
Did you bring a friend?
No.
Then as a mental exercise I invite you to figure out why the two of us can't play three-person chess.
Can you believe this guy?
"Social protocol does, however, require me to bring you a hot beverage in your time of need."
"No, thank you."
I'm fine.
It's not optional.
We're out of tea.
I hope you like bouillon.
"I, uh, I guess you're probably wondering what's got me down."
"Actually, I was wondering if I could add a third new chess piece."
How do you think people would feel about Prince Joey-- the king's feeble-minded but well-meaning cousin?
"I'm going to be 30 years old, and I have no one in my life to love me."
"I'm such a basket case, I can't even talk to a woman without having alcohol in my body."
"The fun thing about Prince Joey is every time he moves, there's a one-in-five chance he'll kill himself."
"Sheldon, listen to me."
"I have a big decision to make, and I'm scared."
Yellow.
Go ahead.
A friend at the School of Pharmacology gave me these new pills they're testing.
He says it's the next big thing for social anxiety disorder.
Fascinating.
What's in it?
Gocha told us to be alert and to shoot everyone and not let anyone escape.
It has only smelt only blood.
But this has smelt our sweat too.
Do you know what will happen if I hack you with this?
Come  hack us now.
Kill us.
Come.
Idiot.
You shot the groom.
Shot them all dead.
They are not your policemen.
"Very honest policemen, as a wonded man if you can do so many things,"
"I wounded you, I can do many things."
"The day I saw your laptop,"
I sent information through the net.
That's why top officers are here.
I know.
"Even if we had planned this operation, this would have been the end."
"In a war, people will die."
We can handle this in the inquiry.
Mind your business.
You go.
"Since your son sent information through the net, we were able to catch a big criminal."
He has done good.
Feel proud of him.
Great job.
I really appreciate you.
"C'mon boys, search the place."
Those who mined diamonds against the law were arrested  punished.
Velu who helped us in this operation was felicitated by the government.
"Moreover, his crimes were pardoned and freed by the court."
Nothing wrong in doing this for a son like you.
I can't sign it.
"Louis, I know this isn't what you wanted, but in my professional opinion, this is the best you're going to do."
At least take a day to think about it.
"And, Louis, this goes without saying, but however tempted you are, don't go see Stephanie."

Shut up!
Don't remind me about that thief.
I'm getting shivers.
"Can I distribute it now, Swami?"
"Inauspicious time will elapse at 11 .59 am, after that it's auspicious time all the way."

"Just 2 minutes only, how will you steal it?"
120 seconds is more than enough for me.
"You're still here, I'm next to you, so many security people around, how will you do it?"
Are your men inside already?
If you don't steal by noon...
I will...
How...how...?
Still 80 seconds only.
Bad man?
Who are you?
A wonder is going to happen inside in 80 seconds.
An extraordinary man will steal all the money right under your nose.
This is confirmed intelligence report.
Who are you?
Go...go...go away...
What's all this?
An unknown man has donated billions of rupees for children's welfare.
He's still donating.
City school children have rallying to thank and wish him well.
The doors are still locked.
Tight security all around.
All our eyes are on money.
"We got Bossman in the cabana getting his balls rubbed, and you're out here asking for the fucking tartare?"
You know the surgeon general just said that stress is more dangerous than smoking?
Maybe you should think about that.
"We miss Wayne, we're fucked."
"Oh, there he is."
It's about fucking time.
Look at him saunter.
"God, that must have been some release, huh?"
"Oh, all right here we go."

I'm gonna need you to reconsider cutting Vernon.
"I've been spending far too much time and getting far too little in returns, Spencer."
"I know I said this before, but this time, it's guaranteed."
Vernon's out of the weed business.
Nothing like getting a guarantee for the second time.
"Ah, no, that first time was a promise."
This is a guarantee.
Totally different thing.
"Bossman, come on, he's a good kid."
"Hell, I know he is."
I'm actually quite fond of him.
Do you gentlemen have any idea how difficult it is to operate the greatest brand in sports?
"You own the New England Patriots, too?"
I'm totally kidding.
"No, we don't."
People are always looking for new ways to knock us down.
"( chuckles ) Yeah, I can relate to that one."
"Hmm, some would say you have it coming, though."
Word is you've been sniffing in the tall weeds with a short snout.
I'm not quite too sure what that even means.
Me either.
"I've never heard that one, no."
Is that how I seemed?
Yes.
"Kim Yang is a descendant of Kim Heon-chang, who led the uprising in Mujinju."
"Kim Heon-chang tried to overthrow the imperial household, and ascend to the throne."
But the punishment for treason is death of all family members.
My father saved Kim Yang.
He learned to survive even after going from being a Jingol noble to the descendant of a treasonous criminal.
He would do anything to survive.
I do not wish to keep him near me.
Did you find out?
"Yes, the man at the harbor was the new Mujinju governor."
What is the new governor doing in Chunghae?
He came to pay his respects to the regent.
Did you call for me?
I need to go to Mujinju.
It would be too dangerous.
Why would you want to go to Mujinju?
I must meet with Madam Jami and seek her help.
It will be useless.
She coldly turned the master down when he asked her for help.
I won't leave her alone if she refuses to help us.
Who's there?
It has been a long time.
What do you think you are doing?
How could you show up in Mujinju under the circumstances?
Do you plan to harm me?
This was the only way to see you.
Do not worry.
I don't mean to harm you.
It upset me very much when I heard that Master Yi was killed at the hands of Jang Bogo.
Why did you come to see me?
I need you to help me.
"You know this assignment was non-fiction, right?"
"Yes, Mr. Wyatt."
"So you and your family killed a werewolf last summer, huh?"
"Why would you write something like this, Sam?"
It doesn't matter.
"As soon as my dad gets back, we're leaving, so."
You can flunk me if you want to.
I'm not flunking you.
"I'm giving you an ""A."""
"Now, aside from the werewolf, is that really how you'd describe your family?"
Yeah
"Well, your brother is quite a character."
"And your father -- he seems, uh, driven."
"Anyway, it's good, Sam."
It's really good.
Have you ever thought about pursuing writing?
I can't.
I have to go into the family business.
Family business?
"Yeah, my dad's a--"
My dad's a mechanic.
"So I have to be a mechanic, too."
"Do you want to go in the family business, Sam?"
No one's ever asked me that before.
Well?
More than anything now.
"Well,"
"I don't want to overstep my bounds here, but... you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do."
"Look, I mean, I know what it's like."
"I come from a family of surgeons, and that wasn't me."
"So, you know, I traded in the money and prestige of being a doctor for all the glamour you see around you."
"But the point is... there may be three or four big choices that shape someone's whole life, and you need to be the one that makes them."
Rajinikanth took it?
Why would he take it?
How would I know sir?
May be he's starting a new party?
Oh God!
He has robbed me clean.
I earned that money by every mean I could in all these years of public life.
"I beg you, please tell me, where's my money?"
"I don't know anything sir, I'll fall at your feet sir."
Hey Officer!
"You took charge with a promise to catch him,"
"I lost crores of rupees, do something I say."
"No expression on face, do something I say."
"Thank God, he plucked few strands of hair only sir."
Wait my partner...wait...
I was expecting your call.
How are you?
Partner?
Who is your partner?
"You helped me in robbing, right?"
Actually I knew that Minister's money is with the peon.
"After I made you my partner in the plan and you caught him,"
"I came to know where's the money, it means I made you also my partner in the crime, right?"
"Want me to send your share of the booty, partner?"
I like you...
You're making a grave mistake by making me your partner.
You became my partner the day you shot a bullet into me.
If I had been your partner I would've shot the bullet into your heart.
Wantonly I shot 6.4 inches away from your heart.
"You're terrific, partner, but you don't know about me."
"Stealing isn't your profession, you're doing it for fun."
You like challenges.
"Well, what..."
"Minor illnesses, minor infections..."
Completely minor things   that could be cured for tiny sums if one only had the will.
We've developed a sort of priority list...
You're an angry man.
That's good.
It gives you a lot of drive.
"The educational supplies we need include books, tables, chairs, beds   but what we need most urgently is medicine."
Eventually we'd like to...
"Yes, yes."
We'd like to take twice as many off the streets.

"- No, thanks."
We'd like to take in twice as many and vaccinate them   which could be done all for less than five kroner a day.
And we'd like to change our food program...
- Do they all sleep in the same room?
- We have 45 at the moment.
"We go to an area, and in two minutes, 40-50 kids gather, who we then feed."
"But after five minutes, there are 500 kids."

It's an extremely impressive project you have established.
Very impressive.
I've looked at different ways I might be able to help.
Thank you very much.
"In all, I found five different projects."
Yours is one of the most interesting.
Thank you.
We're glad to hear it.
But may I ask you why?
Like I said...
It's a good project.
"Oh, Carl, it is, believe me."
"I want the UV with the triple foam protectorant, and the car nouveau waxed."
The good stuff.
You just don't even worry about it.
"Just sit back on that gurney, and, you know, suck from that mask, and relax."
"All right, then."

"Wearing a paper gown is a little off-putting, but, you know, I'll go with it."
"When we do the interior, we like to enhance it with an aroma."

"Nah, I'm afraid not, sir."
No Pina Colada.
"Okay, how about Strawberry Boobs?"
"Nah, we ain't got that, neither."
"What we do have is Athlete's Foot,"
"Bloated Beach Cod, and Stank Breath."
Go through the list again.
"Oh, here we go."
This is the first part of our patented three-step treatment.

And why are we doing this again?
It's just a pre-coat.
"I mean, obviously we need to prep the outer coat for, you know, the cat urine."
"And, of course, the hammers."
What the frick are you doing?
"Hey, Carl, let's lay back down and relax, okay?"
Just allow the mystery gas to do its work.
"And in two days, when the planets align, we must offer up the Torch of Truth to the Temple of Ages and reveal the treasure."
And that is why it is essential we find the--
The Torch.
"But if the cult took the Torch from the Ark, where did they put it?"
"Well, they probably hid it in the safest place they knew."
The caves of Exeter.
The cult made these paintings of Atlantis based on descriptions from the platinum book itself.
It must have been paradise.
Yes.
"Torch of Truth, I presume."
"Yes, that's right."
Yes.
It doesn't tell us much.
What does it look like?
"Well, nobody knows exactly."
"I mean, these are the only visual representations that I've seen."
"Well, how can we find the Torch if we don't know what it looks like?"
"Well, Solon says that it's the mirror of the world, reflecting the past, present, and future."
"Professor, you said the cult was driven out by the Romans."
"Yes, the ones that weren't killed uh, fled with the Ark."
But they thought Solon was coming back for the Torch someday.
"Yes, that's right."
"That's right, yes."
"Well, maybe they hid it where they figured only he could find it."
Maybe.
Is this the same writing that's on the Ark?
"Yes, yes, this is the, uh, riddle of Solon."
These streaks look like rust.
Iron ore.
The altar's magnetic.
Let's check it out.
Wow.
"However, I see you have no such doubts."
"I shall miss you, my dear boy."
But do not hurry back on my account.
Fear worked like yeast in my thoughts.
"And the fermentation brought to the surface in great gobs of scum, the images of disaster."
"A loaded gun, held carelessly at a stile... a horse rearing and rolling over... a shaded pool with a submerged stake a car at a blind corner."
All the catalogue of threats to civilised life rose and haunted me.
I even pictured a homicidal maniac mouthing in the shadows swinging a length of lead pipe.
"Tickets, please, sir."

"- Yes, on the train."
"Well, I expect it was beastly."
There's some more at home.
Sebastian and I are alone so we thought we'd wait for you.
- But what happened to him?
- Didn't he say?
I expect he thought you wouldn't come if you knew.
He cracked a bone in his foot so tiny that it hasn't a name.
But they X-rayed it yesterday and told him to keep it up for a month.
"It's a great bore to him, putting out all his plans."
He's been making the most enormous fuss.
Everybody else has gone.
At first he tried to make me... stay back with him.
Just a minute.

I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money.

I knew Jimmy.
He had the cash.
It was his.
"I knew he kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it."
It made him sick to hafta turn the money over to the guys who stole it.
He'd rather whack them.
"Anyway, what did I care?"
I wasn't asking for anything.
"And besides, Jimmy was making nice money through my Pittsburgh connections."
"Still, months after the robbery they were finding bodies all over."
"When they found Carbone in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy."
"Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy."
He was like a kid.
"We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people and even after a while, the Lufthansa thing began to calm down."
But the thing that made Jimmy so happy that morning was that this was the day that Tommy was being made.
"Jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made."
He must have made four calls to Tommy's house.
They had a signal all set up so he'd know that the minute that the ceremony was over.
"-Ma, where are you?"
-Here I am.
-You're home.
-Home?
I'm leaving.
"In other words, her aura spread into the atmosphere."
We are surrounded by a fog that is composed of a mixture of many different types of auras.
What your granfather says is always so interesting.
I feel like I am looking for the roots of my own soul.
It is really fun.
"How did you ever get interested in things like this, Saho-san?"
The first time I remember being interested was about four years ago.
Four years ago?
Yeah.
An old lady that was a friend of the family died.
"During the wake, in a room that was filled with smoke, everyone was talking about the person who passed away."
That is when it hit me...
Maybe there is a way to see something that we normally cannot see...
Like that old lady's will.
"I wondered how I could do that, and if I could, how much I could see."
That is why I am interested in things like this.
"But, the other world gets further and further away the more we try to learn about it."
I would really like to see it.
I would really love to see the air-flow in a way I have never seen before.
Something like this fog.
Do you really want to see the other world?
"Yes, I do."
If it is possible to see.
Saho-san is like no one else I have ever met before.
I'm home!
Ah!
Sis!
What are you doing with all of those books?
!
Ah!
Mizuki...
Welcome home.
- Yeah.
I also.
Why did you come back?
And you risked all this?
I was once a slave.
"I dreamed of it, like a free man walking on ice."
No matter how many men tried to pull that dream out of my mind.
I hid it deep in my heart.
And now as a free man I walk on the ice.
I found myself chained to this beautiful flower.
"And she deserved more, like my simple dream."
This is not a place where the soul of a child can flourish.
Your wife spoke of a magnificent place in the west.
Where the ice must melt.
And the seasons have agreed for decades.
It is a myth.
Anyone who has gone to look for him never came back.
Would you have returned from this place if you had discovered something beautiful?
Only a small flower changes the course of humanity
And the opinions of a man.
Your wife promised to show me the way to this place.
The next day she was dead.
The promise of Selegna Sol died with her
Do not.
She hid the coordinates deep into my DNA.
"Somehow, my intuition pushed me to find out."
Selegna Sol.
"It's a pretty long night, on the other side of the world"
It will be the journey of life.
Trajan will send the Spartans to hunt you down.
Not if he thinks I'm dead.
This is one of the original prototypes of the Ash-300 series.
I feel like I'm 14 (shudders) ag-a-in.
That... was on me.
He wasn't gonna do anything.
- How much is his therapy costing again?
- (sighs)
We used to think that was snark.
- Now we know it's wit.
- Yeah.
"Uh, Mr. Peterson, we just want to be certain that this environment's the right fit for Lily."
We have a lot of experience dealing with accelerated students.
"But if Lily really is gifted, then maybe there's another path... private schools."
"Although, I do love the diversity of a public school."
"- On the other hand, I do wonder..."
"- Okay, you know what?"
We're just deciding if she's gonna skip a grade.
We're not charting out the next 20 years of her life.
"Well, no, choices have consequences."
"If we don't do this right, she could lose all interest in school and drop out, and the next thing you know, we're supporting her and her deadbeat boyfriend and our savings are drained, and then we have to sell the house!"
"Okay, why do all your meltdowns have to do"
- with us selling the house?
- I'm just saying...
- We're gonna give you guys a minute.
- Okay.
"Lily, do you want to see the computer lab?"
This feels like a good time to tell you I'm adopted.
Maybe Claire's right.
Maybe it's too much pressure for her to skip a grade.
"I did it, and I'm fine."
Uh-huh.
I'm sorry.
Um...
"Hey, w-what does ""uh-huh"" mean?"
You know?
Can i call my parents in nebraska?
I just--I want to warn them
About all the stuff on the news before they see it.
Sorry.
"Till we turn you in,"
We can't risk letting anyone know you're here.
Trial lawyers have great hearing.
It comes from trying to hear what jurors are whispering about.
Where exactly did you meet stein?
We met through prime match...at hyde.
This is bad.
"They're gonna say ann's a prostitute,"
"Or as they say in hollywood, a ""strategic dater""--"
A girl who goes out with a rich man
Because he gives her nice things.
What are you talking about?
Prime match is this dating service
That throws parties at clubs like hyde.
Women get in free to interact with rich men
Who pay for the privilege.
How do you know all this?
I've gone to the parties with my friends... rarely.
I just end up being the designated driver
And the one who saves them from bad situations like stein.
"If you ever went out, you'd know these things,tom."
"Well,did you know the dead guy,lenny stein?"
"No,but i know his type."
"I know ann's type,too."
She's a poor girl trying to live larger than she can afford.
"Yeah,well,she's not that poor."
You see her clothes tonight?
I can't do what you're asking.
"- If they take him, my son will die."
"Miriam, I think you should leave now."
Save my child.
She won't be the last.
The County Organiser thought we had little choice but to close due to catastrophic loss of membership.
"She had been in touch with Joyce but Joyce has refused to return, which means none of her supporters will either."
She suggested we join our nearest Institute for the duration.
Did she explain how we're to cover 16 miles there and back on bicycle?
"At night, with military vehicles charging all over the place?"
She did not.
So that's it.
"Either way, Joyce has got what she wanted."
The closure of the WI.
"Well, then, not if we attract more members."
How are we going to do that?
"In all honesty, I've no idea."
But that doesn't mean we give up.
I should be getting back.
- And me.
You did what you thought was the right thing to do.
Up to a point.
Then I acted on impulse and made the situation intractably worse.
Me and my big mouth strike again.
"Well, I happen to love you and your big mouth."
"Thank you, Peter."
That makes me feel...
marginally better.
Cookie says supper will be five minutes while the beef rests.
"Thank you, Claire."
Is there something else?
- I just want to thank you... for letting me come and work here after Mrs Cameron let me go.
- Yeah?
- [breathing heavily]
"Um, so..."
"Uh, I fucking do remember one."
"Uh, there one-- there once was an oyster whose story I tell that found that some sand had gotten into his shell."
"It was only a grain, but it gave him great glee for oysters have feelings--"
Just tell me it's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.
You're fine.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
You're okay.
So you admit that you are a liar.
"I lied about Ryan Larson, but that does not make me a liar."
To lie is to be a liar be definition.
Anan:
If I may explain--
The question is not if you're a liar because you are.
"The question is, were you lying when you said he was suicidal or are you lying now?"
Or when you broke your oath to the Church not to reveal the secrets of the confessional.
I would like to explain.
You have already tried.
You can try again with the jury.
Let's just hope none of them are Catholics or people who care about the truth.
Clearly Mr. McBride has bigger legal problems than our case.
Why hasn't he been charged yet?
Do you really think he killed someone?
Come on.
"I mean, I know you hate the guy, but-- but murder?"
"He's killed others-- not directly, but by his actions as a defense lawyer releasing killers."
"This is a huge break for us, whether McBride gets charged or not."
- For hurricanes.
Yeah.
- This is a radioactive cloud.
- I wouldn't call it a cloud.
"You wouldn't call it the end of a Yankee game, either."
I don't know.
"You got your sirens, route and tone alerts on local radio and TV."
- Paul Reveres go out.
- Civil defense volunteers.
"Yeah, we got the armory in Caldwell, 75 miles away, for refugees."
"Still, we're talking about widespread panic and chaos, right?"
I assume.
- Anything else?
- I don't wanna go back to my meeting.
"- Well, you're not staying here."
- Okay.
There must be 110 million for distance learning and telemedicine.
Can we shave that down?
There are three rural committee members who love distance learning.
I'm not sure I see the point if the rural poor don't have Internet hookups.
- Why don't we plus-up the entire bill?
- Sir?
We get our Internet 52 million.
They get to add 52 million for Internet-blocking software or whatever they want.
Can't we do that?
One of the problems is they're deficit hawks.
- We're deficit hawks too.
- That's the other problem.
"All right, work with me here."
What do they want?
"A bridge, a highway a soda machine?"
What do they want?
"If you can't drink their toasts and sing their songs, love Jeff Davis and hate Abe Lincoln until next Friday, you'll never reach Marietta."
I'm sorry.
Then you were exaggerating about Shiloh?
Yes.
"When I bring them good news, I'm doubly welcome."
The truth is bad enough.
Bad enough to stop General Mitchell's advance?
No.
"Shiloh can't stop him, but the devilish rains may."
"The trouble is, our movements and his have to dovetail."
[Andrews] He has an army and cannon to move.
"It's taking a chance, but we'll have to postpone our plans for one day."
I'll wait here for the rest of the men.
"You go into Chattanooga, and if you see any of the boys who didn't come this way, pass the word along."
[snoring]
What'd you do before the war?
Taught school a while.
How do you like this business?
There's one side of it I can't get used to.
Mr. Mclntyre... and the widow woman who fed us and gave us her bed...
"When I deceive 'em, I feel like the lowest snake that crawls."
I know.
"That soldier, he's supposed to be my enemy."
I'm supposed to hate him the way Campbell does.
But I don't think I can.
It's worse when a Southerner's your best friend.
Like old Jim Lindsay.
"Even picked out the girl I'm going to marry, 'cause she's Yankee-minded like me."
"Now that I've turned spy and have to fool him,"
I can hardly look him in the eye anymore.
How do you stand it?
I believe in a federal union.
We were terrified.
"My parents woke us up in the dead of night, told us we were leaving and never coming home."
"But they also told us not to be frightened, because they were bringing along this weathered old steamer trunk that contained everything we needed to be protected from danger."
And what was in it?
It didn't matter.
We felt protected.
You grew up in D.C.?
"Mm, I moved around a lot, like you."
I was a military brat.
Did you find that hard- adjusting to all the moves?
- At first.
But my dad bought me a little souvenir postcard every city we went to.
That made me feel like home.
"I know it sounds silly-- a postcard from the place you just moved to, but from a guy like my dad, who had trouble showing emotion..."
I knew it didn't come easily.
Does he still send you postcards?
Not anymore.
I seem to have lost track of the time.
I'm late for this meeting.
What was that you said about balancing business and pleasure?
I'll be back at the house in an hour.
"In the meantime, try the plantains."
They put the croquetas to shame.
What are you doing?
You here for pleasure?
I had to come look for you.
"Come on, let's go."
Get in.
Glad you called.
"I've had this line scrubbed and back-checked, and I'm clear to talk on my end."
Can you speak freely?
You can.
I was a guy.
I didn't want to spend Sundays in the kitchen with my mom.
And you know what she said?
She told me that some day I would realize that taking care of people is not masculine or feminine.
It's a privilege and it's an honor.
And she was right.
And one day I realized that politics is about the privilege and the honor of taking care of people.
"Of making certain that the weak are protected, the poor are sheltered and the hungry fed."
"My mother passed away six years ago, but I work every day to honor her memory in politics and in my kitchen."
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.
It's good to see you.
Thank you.
I appreciate the support.
Good to see you.
Weren't you impressed?
You were talking to Republican women.
"What do you think, they were gonna storm the stage?"
This is your first week.
Shouldn't you be kissing up?
There is nothing sexier than a man who loves his mom.
I'm glad you enjoyed the speech.
You are so much better looking in person than you are on C-SPAN.
Nobody looks good on C-SPAN.
Believe me.
It's the lighting.
"Oh, those baby-blues, cheekbones that can cut glass, financials are impeccable."
I have to rate you a 94.5.
I have to take off something for the divorce.
Thank goodness you were not the cheater.
- I'm sorry.
"When I see him,"
I just feel like doing all I can for him.
I pity him too and I worry what would become of him if I weren't here.
Do you know this feeling?
Miss!
Miss!
We're in trouble.
What happened?
I heard Prince Ju-Mong wasn't searching for a new route.
Then... where did he go?
I heard he went to the bandit's hideout.
"That Oh-Yi who went with him, told one of the guards, DongSu"
He said he's going to get the bandit's leader.
He must be bloody insane!
How can he be so reckless?
Looks like Prince Ju-Mong can no longer serve as a weapon for you.
It seems there aren't many guards watching over this cell.
We just have to deal with those four at the entrance.
Their vigilance will waver at night.
"As long as we neutralize their leader, they'll break into disarray."
"Commander, someone from BuYeo is here to buy the slaves."
"Oh, really?"
You're here.
is Boss with you?
"Boss has some urgent matters to look into,"
"I can handle matters, don't worry."
Do you have a few good ones?
There should be quite a bunch.
"Anyway, let's cut some slack on the transactions."
It must have been difficult for you to travel so far
Why don't you have a drink first?
Go have a look at the slaves and see if there're any good ones.
I just want to... stick him in the freezer.
Maybe thaw him out later when I'm ready to deal with him.
"That's a... that's a horrible thing to say, isn't it?"
Yes.
Oh.
But the horrible things they're... things that need to be said.
Can I ask you question?
Shoot.
Where the hell is Cooper?
"He's busy saving a patient, trying to make up for the fact that he didn't save you."
What?
Is he... blaming himself for... except for the part he blames on me.
I called him that night.
I was the reason he didn't walk in that door and save you.
I guess you owe me.
Tammy has a very rare tumor on her ovary called an ectopic pheochromocytoma.
"It intermittently releases an excess of adrenaline,"
"Causing a rise in heart rate, blood pressure,"
"All leading to fear, anger and Tammy's sudden rages."
"And, Michelle, nothing that you did or do not do"
During pregnancy caused this.
"But we found it, which means we can fix it."
"Yeah, I can remove it laparoscopically."
Without the need for a large incision.
"Which means at all those moods that you've been feeling, they should stop."
"All this time, I've been blaming myself."
I can't believe it.
You're gonna be okay.
But dad isn't.
But you cannot feel guilty for something you couldn't control.
But I do.
"And taking out this tumor, it won't change that."
Of course I will.
Absolutely.
It's gonna seem so weird here without her.
And the house is gonna be so empty.
-The dishwasher's just....
-It's okay.
"So how are you faring, Julie?"
"You know you've got to try and be strong, for your dad's sake because he's a right wreck down there, I tell you."
"What am I gonna do, Auntie Alice?"
I'm gonna have to kill myself.
I was already gonna have to kill myself before after I got dumped by this boy at school.
-Before all this happened.
"-Oh, God."
"So, now you've got to kill yourself twice."
"Listen, a great girl like you, there'll be loads of other boyfriends."
"Yeah, except I'll never get another one now, will I?"
-Why ever not?
-Because...
I'm different to all the other girls.
I don't talk like them.
"'Cause they're all like, ""Hey, I'm so cool,"" and ""That's so not true."""
"And ""She was like, 'Hey' and I was like, 'Chill'."""
"And ""fess up"" and ""don't diss me""."
"I mean, why can't they speak properly, you know?"
"I mean, Mum was always teaching me how important it was to... express yourself clearly and intelligently if you want to get anywhere in life."
"Of course, she's serving a jail sentence now for embezzlement, but...."
"I'm sorry I just can't say all those things which, of course, makes me totally weird."
I don't think you're weird.
I think the fact you're a bit different from them and want to think for yourself is wonderful.
"Always remember, ""A cliché is the handrail of a crippled mind."""
That's very good.
-Who said that?
Give away classified information about a top secret operation?
Yes.
They will believe you.
"If I'm right, this could decide the fate of your navy or perhaps the fate of this country Chosun."
Why me?
Why are you asking me to do such an important task?
I gave you that answer when I gave you the galleys.
All right.
Let's do this.
The people of this country will be deeply grateful.
What is it?
It's a secret memo from Yi Soon-shin to Kwon Yul.
What's the content?
He will launch a second attack on Wekyo Fort on the 18th and seeks assistance of the ground troops.
Yi Soon-shin is launching a second attack on Konishi?
This is our chance.
We can strike Yi from the rear and save my father-in-law.
Oh?
But why was this boy going to Gon-yang?
"And of all roads to chose from, why by way of our camp?"
Take him and find out.
And send a few men to Gon-yang.
Are the contents of the letter accurate?
I don't know anything.
Why did you land on our beach?
I was swept off course by a storm.
Why were you headed to Gon-yang?
Don't you know anything?
General Kwon Yul is in Gon-yang assembling an army.
"You're not an adjutant or a special agent, but you were assigned to deliver classified information to the Field Marshal."
That's unlike Yi Soon-shin.
You were sent here to deceive us.
Take a good look at him.
"All right, sit down there."
Our job is going to be to take very good care of him.
"I'll be taking too bloody good care of myself, thank you."
"My, my, what a nice little lace doily."
Look at him.
No nerves.
Sleeps through it all.
One more crack like that it'll be no teeth.
That's enough of that.
Save all that for the Jerries.
"I think the men are getting a bit on edge, Sir."
You think they're the only ones?
Did I ever tell you about the Ghurkhas when I was in India?
Wonderful little soldiers.
"When I asked for volunteers to jump, the whole battalion stepped forward."
"So I told them about their conditions of training and that they'd do their first jump from 1,000 feet."
There was absolute uproar.
"Then finally, their subedar major, he's the equivalent of the RSM, stepped forward and said, ""Sahib, the men are not easy in their minds."
"""They would rather do their first jump from 500 feet."""
"""Look"", I said, ""At 500 feet the parachutes mayn't have time to open."
A broad grin spread over his face.
"""Ooh, Sahib,"" he said,"
"""we didn't realise we were going to have parachutes!"""
Thank you.
"I never thought it was that funny, myself."
Just crossing the French coast.
Throwing you out in a few minutes.
Thank you.
Prepare for action.
One last word.
All wounded have to be left just where they are.
I don't know enough about her abilities.
- There's plenty for her to do back here.
"- I don't know what she's capable of either, but we've got to find out sooner or later."
"It's an interrogation, not a training exercise."
She's the only member of the team fluent in arabic.
- There are other translators.
"- Yeah, but they haven't studied behavior."
She ever have her ready bag yet?
My guess is there isn't much this woman's unprepared for.
Car leaves in 4 minutes.
"Yes, sir."
Dale Turner mused:
"""Some of the best lessons are learned from past mistakes."
"The error of the past is the wisdom of the future."""
"Excuse me, sir."
I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate... do not thank me.
- Sir?
- It's not a favor.
- Of course.
I know that.
- You're coming to do a job.
Do you think the interrogation of Jind Allah will work in time?
Interrogation's the most dynamic form of profiling.
That's not an answer.
Sir.
He's been locked away in Gitmo.
He doesn't know we raided the cell's safe house.
That's an advantage for us.
The main thing is to get him talking about anything.
Then his language and body movements will betray him.
It's like this- you focus on the way your opponent holds his piece.
How quickly and firmly he places it.
- No.
And here it is.
"Okay, great."
We'll take it in together.
"Like you said, we have deal, right?"
"Oh, so now the deal's back on?"
Austin:
Drop the knife!
"Austin, the police know we're here."
"If you kill us, they will catch you."
I'm not gonna kill you.
Then why are you holding us at gunpoint?
Because you're robbing me?
We're not robbing you.
We're getting evidence that you are a serial killer.
"Like this knife, which as been used in seven ritualistic murders."
What are you talking about?
I-I'm not a serial killer.
I'm a film director.
And that is a prop from a horror movie I shot two years ago.
"Well, prop or not, this knife matches our victims' wounds exactly."
"There were five identical knives made for that film, which means there are four others out there just like it."
Maybe you should be looking for one of those.
But you were in New York for three of those murders.
"So were 8 million other people, including my assistant, who can prove my whereabouts at all times."
Now get the hell out of my house!
- Do you think you could...
- Hey.
Okay.
"Well, the director was telling the truth."
His alibis check out for all three New York murders.
Then we need to track down all the knives that were made for that horror movie.
We're already seeking permission to exhume the body.
Thanks.
We'll be taking this from here.
- We've got an ongoing...
- It's ours now.
We'll keep you in the loop as best we can.
It seems like you're in everybody's good books.
'Ticket number 41.'
Do you know how long I've been waiting?
- You need to complete the form.
- I've done all the forms!
- You're taking the piss!
- Lindsay?
- Yeah.
My name's Tammy.
I'm one of the multi-disciplinary offender management team.
- Is this your first appointment?
- Yep.
I'm ready to restart my life...
Lovely.
.. by rejoining the police service.
Bollocks to this!
"Er... it says here that you were acquitted of conspiracy to murder, but found guilty of perverting the course of justice."
"Yes, I'm appealing against the conviction."
I'm going to clear my name.
You won't be able to rejoin the police with a criminal conviction.
"I told you, I'm appealing."
Have you actually checked to see that I can rejoin?
"No, I haven't checked."
"Well, then, I would like to apply to rejoin the police service."
"I'm sorry, why are you looking at me like that?"
"Lindsay, I don't know you, I've got nothing against you, but I can't help you if you're going to be in denial."
And maybe you better say them outside.
"Take it easy, Axel."
I'm the one he's throwing the sour grapes at.
You bet your life I am.
The slide trombone of the furniture business.
"Well, Norstaad, according to your bidding rules, the highest bidder is supposed to put down $50,000 before the contract is signed."
Have you seen one penny of Somers' money yet?
I've got the check right here.
- That satisfy you?
- No.
I think Mr. Hadley is being quite hysterical.
"Axel, a deal is a deal, and I see no justification for the slightest delay in signing the contract."
Good.
Let's do it right now.
"Lisa, give to me the contracts."
There's no fool like an old fool.
"When first I see sketch like this one month ago,"
I say yes.
This is what Children's Hospital should look like.
"And then I say, ""Mr. Reed, it is like you look into my mind and into my heart and put on paper what you see there."""
Now it is all done with blue paper and arithmetic.
"Edie, you like it?"
"Yes, I like it very much indeed."
"You don't know how happy I am to hear that, Miss Morrow."
Why shouldn't you hear it?
Isn't Edie friend of yours?
"I tell you a secret, Latham."
"When you bring me sketch and idea, this is very good."
But next thing you do for me is even better.
"When I say ""Where we will get the money?"""
"you say ""I know beautiful lady who knows all about how to raise money."""
"Axel, please, you're getting carried away"
Got any words for your audience?
- Point the camera at Shannon.
- OK.
"So, Shannon, tell us why we're in the middle of a chase scene."
Because Kyle Weathers is a glory hunter who only wants fame and he doesn't care what he destroys to get it.
He has taken two beautiful wolves out of their natural habitat to make himself look good and make money.
And I'm not going to let that happen.
We're not going to let that happen.
Sorry.
"You can edit that out, right?"
And this bit too?
Pesky kids.
I'm not moving until you let the wolves go.
Didn't Mummy and Daddy teach you that we can't always get what we want?
They taught me to stand up for what's right.
Then they did a much better job than my parents.
Go home and make them a cuppa to say thanks.
You said you were just like me.
"Oh, sweetie."
No-one's that weird.
So everything you said was a lie?
"Finally, you get it."
Now will you move?
I should have known you were too good to be true.
"And because I trusted you, everything mysterious and magical is over."
"Yeah, cheese factor 50."
"Are all teenage girls like this, or just the crazy ones?"
I'm glad I'm not like you.
"Shannon, if your plan was to appeal to my better nature, it's not going to work."
I don't have one.
"Yeah, that was Plan A."
Plan B was to keep you talking long enough for Tom to sneak round the back of your truck and let the wolves go.
The intention.
I propose to remain a professional soldier when this war is over.
I propose to remain a professional soldier when this war is over.
"Than the men you're fighting, it's as simple as that."
"Now, this morning you make your first jump from an aircraft."
"Are you aware that parachuting, is described as dicing with death in the sky."
It's a revolting phrase and quite apart from that it's grossly untrue.
"Parachuting, in any case, is just a means to an end."
"It gets you into battle, no more."
"After that, you're an ordinary soldier."
Now remember that.
You're soldiers not stuntmen.
To get your wings you'll do seven jumps.
"After that, you'll jump whenever ordered."
A refusal means 84 days detention and your wings stripped off in front of the Colonel.
"So if any of you has any idea that he doesn't want any part of this, now is the time to say so."
It's no disgrace either.
Not now.
Good.
Carry on.
Sir.
"All yours, Mr Aldridge."
"Split, on left, turn!"
"Left-right, march!"
"Left, right, left, right..."
What was that?
The engine changed its noise.
I means the pilot's throttling back.
"Yes, that means we've got to get ready."
Prepare for action.
"Nothing to it, my lads."
88 jumps I've had and loved every one of them.
I agree with Raymond.
- Can you blame him for saying that?
- No.
"We can't spend that much money, not on this day... not with this technology."
I can just superimpose them and I Photoshop them on my Mac...
But you'd be cheating yourself and the reader.
I don't think the reader is really gonna know.
The reader knows.
How do I know?
Because I knew!
"Look, I was raised in the trailer part..."
- that won't leave this table.
"- Oh, God!"
But the point is:
I looked foward to... getting my monthly Skirt.
I dropped off right on the trail... to get me just a dollop of gloss and glamour.
"I needed that, so did other millions of teenage girls... ass-wash clad, coming off the arcade."
We needed that.
We wanted hope and fantasy.
- And we want our gargoyles real.
"- Yes, we want real gargoyles..."
Do you understand us?
Real gargoyles!
There's my sweetie.
"Hey, sweetie... sit you cute butt down here."
She's great!
Am I interrupting something?
We are entrenched in this serious debate... about the importance of investing in beauty.
- Have you any thoughts?
- They want to sacrifice... their soul for some change.
Do you want to decide between the budget and truth?
What they're saying is if there should be caps on our shoots.
That's for sure.
"""Who needs them!"" There's no television."
"And that refrigerator, guess how much I had to beg her to buy it?"
She still won't go for a washing machine.
"""Washing can be done without a thing like that,"" she says."
"A stone head, with a reed screen over it."
"It's delicious, really delicious!"
Eating with all of you makes the food extra tasty.
Grandma.
Let my sister cook the meals starting tomorrow.
I'm sure it will be good for everybody.
"And it will be much easier on you, too, Grandma."
Don't worry about me.
To put it simply...
Grandma's cooking is driving us to despair.
"In other words, your cooking just doesn't agree with our tastes."
"I mean, as a matter of fact, it's just plain lousy."
"I'm sorry, Grandma, but... this pumpkin and kidney beans, and pumpkin and chicken... it's so boiled down with soy sauce that we can't even tell which piece is which."
"-It is so black, and pulpy, and saIty--"
-Tateo!
I think Grandma's cooking is lousy because of her false teeth.
"As long as everything is soft, it's all right with her."
-But we don't have false teeth.
-Shinjiro!
"Shinjiro, you sure are great!"
You did real well.
That's true.
Because of you...
I can sit at the table starting tomorrow with a sense of relief.
You mean eating is your only concern?
But you can't get away that easy.
"Tomorrow, we go shopping in Nagasaki."
"When their valuables are being broken, he is getting angry."
Doubt No. 4..
- Mr. Ratnam...
Madam..
- Stop it now.
Something is wrong.
"Everything is wrong, madam."
You go their marriage anniversary party in the night.
Observe whether they are real husband and wife or not.
We had to commit that psycho as husband as you slipped your tongue then.
Now we are having to continue that as you slipped the file.
"Can't avoid sir, as it is our need."
"But, that fellow should not put his hands on him."
"Why do you feel her as your wife, sir?"
"She is just your Facebook friend, right?"
"- Whoever it may be but she is a lady, right?"
"Fine, you keep watching in the web cam."
I will control the over action of that mental fellow.
Go and somehow catch that jackass.
"I will handle him, you go and make your Facebook friend agree first."
"Impossible, I cannot tolerate his torture."
He is just disgusting.
"Please Malini, Vasu got a doubt."
Please co-operate this once.
Fine..
This better be the last time.
This is the last time.
Thank you so much Malini.
"Brother-in-law, he confused me like a new app in the morning."
Now I got a grip.
I will squash it like Candy Crush.
"If they does any extras, will mix cocaine in the Coke, they will die in coma."
-Of course.
The items you pick out to tell her will be very easy to understand.
"Thank you, Rosa, from me and my wife."
Thank you.
"If I were your wife, I'd cut your heart out."
Good morning.
"Thank you for speaking to me, darling."
-May I tell you what happened?
-If you want to.
"Well, after we finished work, it was early, so I dropped in at the Del Rio for a drink."
"Like an idiot, I stayed too long, and so as punishment I suppose,"
"I got into a rumpus with a drunk, and got knocked cold."
But what was the fight about?
What's a fight ever about?
Nothing.
"Anyway, I was stretched out on the sidewalk with policemen and photographers rushing at me, and suddenly, I was rescued."
"A nice little Italian girl I'd met inside, hustled me into a cab and took me home to her grandmother."
"Well, they kept at me with cold towels and hot coffee until I snapped out of it."
"That's it, Jess."
"I know it sounds improbable, but it's true."
-Do you believe me?
"-Yes, Bran."
But wasn't that an amazingly kind thing for that girl to do?
A girl who'd just met you.
That's the best part of the story.
Rosa's a model at Marianne's.
"She's seen you there, and admired you."
She didn't want me to get into a mess that might upset you.
"Incidentally, she was very disapproving of me for being out alone."
She said she'd cut my heart out if she were you.
You wouldn't be any good to me without a heart.
You wouldn't be able to love me.
- Let's do it.
Got some wire hangers at my place.
"Oh, great, well, let's steal a car, go to your place, get the wire hangers, come back, steal another car, and just drive off."
OK.
I feel like it wouldn't be weird for you to kiss me right now.
Every girl's so beautiful to me.
I don't wanna think about her at all anymore.
- You should have followed her.
- She wouldn't have me.
"And besides, she's moved on."
"And in a way, so have I."
"Just not actually, of course."
"Well, I speak from experience when I say that it is horrible... to be treated in a way that only points out how meaningless you are."
Never thought of it that way.
(♪ INDIE DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
He's here.
MAN:
"Yeah, he just walked into your bedroom."
"Oh, hey, how's it goin'?"
You're a monster.
I hate you.
Then I doubt you'll mind me being gone through December.
I don't even know how to respond to that.
I've been offered a position teaching creative writing at Lambert College.
I'm moving there for the semester.
You stood in my way when I had so many opportunities.
I guess that's why I'm telling you about this after I agreed to it.
So you decided to sneak back in the middle of the night?
"It's not the middle of the night, Ashley."
It's 10:00pm.
"Besides, I had some meetings in the city that ran late, and I considered just buying new clothes, but I needed to get some books I wanted to re-read."
"Also, I want my car."
Still is.
"I mean, every guy who meets Maggie falls madly in love with her."
And that's the problem.
"Since I've known her, she's only been single for, like, three brief windows of opportunity."
TED:
"When she moved here and broke up with her college boyfriend,"
I waited a month.
"You know, so I wouldn't be the rebound guy."
"Well, the rebound guy lasted two years."
This is Dave.
TED:
"After they broke up, I only waited a week."
I was still too late.
She dated that guy for three years.
"The next time, I wasn't messing around."
I was at her door not one hour after they broke up.
"The only thing she did between becoming single and the moment I got there, was go downstairs and check her mail."
I was still too late.
And she dated that guy for four years.
"I wasn't going to let this happen again, so I begged her neighbor, Mrs. Douglas, to call me the second she and David broke up."
"And now, a very single and available Maggie Wilks is on her way to this very spot."
I sent a cab with a female driver so she'd have no other interaction with a man until she got to me.
Where she will still have no interaction with a man.
What up?
I feel good tonight.
Tonight's going to be good.
"Oh, hell, yeah!"
It's my overalls.
I wore these babies all throughout high school.
These were my jam.
"God, you really were a virgin before you met Lily, weren't you?"
(LILY CHUCKLING)
HENRY:
Make sure to mark this place.
We're leaving a fortune under these rocks.
"Glass, chart a course."
Tightest you can that gets us around the Ree.
FITZGERALD:
This ain't right.
We all know these furs ain't gonna be here by the time we come back.
There's no way we can haul them all the way to the fort.
Arikara are all through the territory.
We'll want our hands free.
We're gonna lose those pelts.
You rather keep the pelts or your life?
Life?
What life you talking about?
I ain't got no life.
I just got living and the only way I get that is through these pelts.
Fuck!
"Ain't no way I'm going home after six months working my ass off like a mule risking my neck, men dying, and for what?"
Damn near lost everything.
Job's been fucked from the start!
There's the one been fucking us.
You wonder how the Ree got the dead drop on us when Mr. Glass was supposed to look out for that very thing?
All them Pawnee buddies of his.
Pawnee's as much against the Ree as the rest of us.
Yeah?
"Well, what about his little half-breed son?"
What kind of savage you think his mama was?
"Oh, lay off the boy, Fitz."
All I'm saying is a savage...is savage.
"Hey, Glass is it true what they say about you shooting a lieutenant while living with them savages?"
Twenty-one dead soldiers and 40 dead feathernecks.
When they try to take your picture?
All our cover is blown.
"An entire race, hidden for millennia, exposed by your weakness."
"Oh, come on."
I'd never get arrested.
I know what to do.
Clearly not.
Which is why the Old Ones contacted me.
"They want you to join them in South America, and they've asked me to organise transit."
You'll travel with my next shipment.
Keep these papers with you and they'll guarantee your safe passage.
"The details are all inside under some, er... cash for emergencies."
"Oh, and while on board, you are not, I repeat not, to touch any of my carpets."
"Oh, wait, wait a second."
I'm not an Old One.
I'm 117.
You are the most wanted man in the country.
Hardly the time to quibble about your age.
"But once I'm there, there's no coming back, right?"
"No, well, why would you want to, eh?"
Come back to this?
!
"Desperation, debauchery, on the fringe of society?"
A slave to your lust and hunger?
"You know, there's nothing funnier than a vampire taking the moral high ground."
"Underneath the driving gloves and the business cards, we're all the same, brother."
"Oh, let me make this clear."
We are not the same.
I am not a servant to my condition.
I have systems in place that allow me to feed without this carnage.
You are weak.
You are craven.
"So it has to be perfect, you see."
It has to be perfect.
It can't be impatient.
It's timeless.
I wanted to ask you.
Do you think-- did anybody know that Lou had three families all at once?
"No, I didn't."
"As a matter of fact, for years, I didn't know Lou was married."
Really?
Yeah.
That was part of his mystery.
[soft piano music]
(Kahn) My mother and I lived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at the end of a secluded road.
"Lou would visit every once in a while, mostly at night."
We never knew quite when it would be.
He'd call at the last minu te and say he was on his way.
My mother would frantically whip up a five-course meal and have a martini in a frozen glass waiting for him.
"I got to stay up late, and Lou would tell me wonderful stories about India and elephants and tigers."
[thunder crackling softly]
"In the middle of the night, we'd all bundle into the car and drive him back downtown."
I'd lie in the backseat.
We were all silent.
"When I asked my ldn't all live together, she explained that his wife wouldn't give him a divorce."
Why didn't he just run away?
We'd stop at the end of Clinton Street and let him out.
"He'd walk down the block and disappear into the dark house, his wife"
Her name was Esther.
"They had a daughter named Sue, who was 20 years older than me."
"When I was in first grade,"
"I found out I had another half sister, Alex."
Her mother was a lady named Anne.
Then there was my mother and me.
"All right, guys, let's do this."
"All right, guys."
"I know this isn't exactly how we'd want it, but if we don't help ourselves, nobody else will."
"I don't remember life before I came to Newman's, some of you might."
But right now all we've got is these ugly uniforms and each other.
And that's what we're fighting for.
"The little dudes, our home, our family."
"And this town is gonna see that, and they're gonna love us, and worship us, and buy us cake and chocolate and candy."
So let's go pound the Hounds!
- Balance.
Inner peace.
Focus.
- Share your souls.
You guys aren't coming with us?
"There's only so much we can teach you, son."
"Plus, we want to save our big entrance for after the game."
They're retiring our jerseys.
- All there is left is inspiration of another.
- Yeah.
Words of a hero.
A hockey hero.
- Doug Gilmour.
- Doug Gilmour.
No way.
"No matter what anybody else says, no matter what anybody else thinks, you play the hockey like you're born to play."
"True to the game, true to yourselves."
"Come on, guys."
"Let's go, come on."
We can hear our voices echoing throughout this depressingly vacant arena as the Newman boys are led out by...
Can you believe it?
"That's NHL star, Doug Gilmour."
And they all seem to be wearing bathrobes of some sort.
Then you best keep traveling.
Yeah.
All right.
Wait.
"Goran, you can't send them out there."
They look like they can take care of themselves.
It may not even start tonight.
It's been three months.
How much longer do you think it'll wait?
Hi.
What are you talking about?
The Daimos.
Never heard of it.
It lives in the forest.
It'll be feeding soon.
"And it is, what, some kind of an animal, or... it's a creature."
"It has the appearance of a man, but it can suck the very life from your bones."
Leaves only a dead withered husk behind.
Sounds familiar.
Stargate Atlantis
"Look, we know you're not used to dealing with strangers, but we may be able to help you with this little problem you're having."
We're used to dealing with this kind of thing.
We call them the wraith.
These are the creatures from the old stories?
From the time of the cullings?
So you have heard of them.
"Yes, but the histories of them are incomplete."
"They tell of the great ships that descended from the sky, but there's no description of the wraith themselves, although there were a few among us who guessed that Daimos might be one of them."
Why?
"Because it, too, came from the sky."
It was about 10 years ago.
A bright light appeared above the village... crashed into the hills.
He's the one I told you about.
"Oh, the Dwayne Pride."
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Hannah Lee.
I'm with the U.S. attorney's office.
"I.E., don't piss her off."
We flew down here yesterday together from D.C.
Nice to meet you.
Helping out with the Javier Garcia investigation?
"Hoping to build a case against him, so I can petition the grand jury for an indictment."
Cut the snake off at the head and get the cartel out of NOLA once and for all.
They don't call it NOLA down here.
They prefer New Orleans.
"Oh, glad to see we made an impression on you, Gregorio."
"Oh, absolutely."
(Pride chuckles)
You come bearing gifts?
"Uh, actually, Garcia does."
"Bourbon, as a thank you, for helping us save his son's school last week."
This is expensive stuff.
I'd say that's more of a bribe.
"Yeah, why I brought it over."
Thought you'd want to log it as evidence.
How's Sebastian?
"I bet he's so excited to be a part of the team, huh?"
"Not part of it yet, still has to make it through FLETC training, which means, until he does, we're short-handed again."
I'm sorry to leave you high and dry.
Yeah.
"But look, if you need any help, just let me know, all right?"
Okay.
Except that I don't think that you can.
"Director Isler made it pretty clear to me that we are only down here to build the case against Garcia, and then (beeping) it's back to D.C. for good."
"""and I can't see his face, but I can see his shoes."
Stacy Adams.
"They're so sexy."""
"And then the guy gets all creepy like,"
"""Let her make her own decisions."""
¶ I got my eye on you.
Any straight-up New Yorkers here right now?
"Yo, you can always tell when somebody's from New York, because when you get in an altercation with them, they'll let you know... what city they came from, what borough they were raised in,"
and at least one thing that happened to them when they was little that qualifies for them whupping your ass in a situation.
"Like my mom, for instance."
"If you would ever get in a verbal fight with my mom, it would never get to fists 'cause she'd fucking, you know, verbally--we--pfft!"
You know fucking New Yorkers.
"They fucking--they'll fuck you up, you know what I'm saying?"
"My mom be just like this here, ""Unh-uh, I'm from Brooklyn."
"""I'm from do-or-die Bed-Stuy Brooklyn."
"""Do not play with me, okay?"
"""There was 40 roaches in my house."
"""We named one of 'em Spot."
I'll kill you.
"Don't play with me."""
"So we at the gas station, right?"
And this lady caught herself taking my mother's pump.
But my mother wasn't having that.
She told me and my sister to get out the car 'cause she was gonna discipline this lady right on spot.
"I said, ""You gonna discipline her right on spot?"""
"She said, ""Mm-hmm."""
"I said, ""Worse than you did when you hit me"""
"with that Ninja Turtles umbrella?"""
"She was like, ""Much worse."""
"I said, ""Oh, snap!"""
She walks up to the lady.
"She was like, ""Unh-uh!"
Why are you laughing?
Why would you miss me when we see each other every day?
It's not the same...
I want to be alone with you like this.
They are Yon and Ha-jin.
- Why those...
- Boss.
They must be pretty anxious.
"I should give them a wedding, as soon as we capture Yum Moon."
"That sounds good, but he can't marry before you do."
It seems to bother him too.
It is all right with me.
"We should suppress the pirates as soon as possible, if not just for them."
- Warrior slaves?
- Yes.
The Jie Du Shi of Jiangsu Province enjoyed gladiator fights.
"He would invite nobles and wealthy merchants to the fights, and wager money."
"Head Chief Jang was the greatest gladiator in Jiangsu, and I discovered him."
"If he had continued to fight as a warrior slave,"
"I would have made a lot of money, and he would have died in the arena."
"But I have put my greed aside, and made him the security officer of a merchant group."
"I do not mean to brag, but I played a big part in his being who he is today."
What is it you wish to say?
My lord.
What is it?
I believe that my ability as a great judge of character has made me a successful merchant.
I would like to stake everything I have on you.
Please take me in.
I do not understand what you mean.
Let's just enjoy our drinks.
I just can't read him.
- Who do you mean?
Think it's good for him to watch that video.
"I mean, it's... worth more than a conviction, right?"
"Grady Burgess had the patients' videos, the files, the pento, the whole operation."
We have enough evidence to close off all three cases.
We seized $1.2 million in drugs from Burgess's place.
Thought the chief was gonna plant a big wet one on me.
"Yeah, hopefully got Des on the accessory charge, so that's good."
"Eh, if it all works out."
"You know, put his ass in jail for a while."
Although his lawyer did request our files.
"As for Mary, she'll be crazy to counsel anyone ever again."
Yeah.
"Yeah, she would be crazy."
"I don't know if anyone's ever gonna see this, but I, Ethan Grant, choose to take my life."
Can I say more?
Can I say why?
"I want my family to know, there's nothing that I would've done differently, so please, forget about the trials..."
and the treatments and...
And that one more year that I didn't get.
Just... just know that...
That I love you all.
I have no regrets.
Are you ever gonna talk to me again?
Talking to you right now.
"I didn't mean to start a fight with you, Jess."
I didn't mean for any of it.
"I just thought we were... experimenting, or whatever."
"I guess it started that way, but..."
I thought it was more than that.
"Well, it... wasn't..."
for me.
"And that maybe sounds bitchy or something, but I'm just being honest."
"Well, I have plenty of glassware at my place, so we'll just donate this stuff to goodwill."
"Whoa, hang on."
You realize some of those are collectables.
Really?
And which is the higher ticket item...
Bam-Bam or Mayor McCheese?
"McCheese, of course."
I think that one's still good for one free refill.
"All right, we'll keep this one and the Sammy Sosa travel mug."
And my cereal bowl.
Holds the perfect serving size.
"Plus, you can wash a baby in it."
Yeah.
"Don't worry, I already packed your cereal bowl."
Now what are we gonna do with your tv?
"Well, you don't have a tv in your bedroom."
"Nah, I don't really like having a tv in the bedroom."
You know who says that?
People who have never had a tv in their bedroom.
Or people who like to read or talk.
"Fine, but while you're reading or talking, what am I supposed to do?"
I don't know.
Digging through your belly button seems to take up a lot of your time.
"So, the only place to watch tv will be downstairs in the lobby?"
"In my house, we call that the living room."
"Yeah, but your mom and your sister are down there, so I'll have to put on pants."
"If I'm gonna put on pants,"
I might as well go to the movies.
"Alright, you can put the tv in the bedroom."
Thanks.
"But if I ever walk in wearing a sexy nightie, and you give me one of these,"
I'm snapping that finger off and any other body part that looks like it.
Yes.
Okay.
We'll be there.
What is it?
What's wrong?
What's going on?
We have to dismember her limbs and separate them in different places.
"Carmen, look for garbage bags."
We'll have to create a safe zone with the bags.
"I don't know who it is, but they better be here quick."
I'm sick of sitting here.
"Hello, ladies."
- It's you.
- Heh.
"You know, you see a lot of crazy things renting out an apartment in Hollywood, but I would have never have expected to have seen what I saw with three innocent, beautiful, successful women like yourselves."
- The smoke alarm.
- You asshole.
Hey.
So you like to videotape your guests?
You sick piece of shit.
"You three are the first, and I'm not a sick piece of shit."
"Just a desperate man, no different than the three of you."
"When I recognized Carmen from her rental profile picture,"
"I thought to myself,"
"""well, maybe this was an opportunity to take care of some financial burdens."""
"So I thought that maybe if I caught her walking around naked or enjoying the company of a man, well, you know."
"Sex tapes, they do, oh, so well."
But what I got?
"Oh, man, what I got was so much better than anything i could have ever imagined."
You're disgusting.
So why wait four months to contact us?
"Well, I'm a smart man, and I know what I want."
- Rats!
- I'll give this bag of gold
This bag of shining gold
To anyone who'll rid us of the rats
Rats!
Who'll rid us of the rats?
Who'll rid us of the rats?
Who'll rid us of the rats?
- Rats!
- Stop!
I'll rid your town of rats
I'll take the bag of gold
You rid the town of rats
You'll get this bag of gold
I've done my work as I was told
Now I'll take my bag of gold
A bag of gold?
You crazy loon!
"Why, all you did was pipe a tune"
All you did was pipe a tune
All you did was pipe a tune
All you did was pipe a tune
All you did was pipe a tune
You're dishonest and ungrateful.
And it really is a shame that the children of this city should grow up to be the same!
I'll save the children from such a fate.
I'll pipe them away before it's too late.
You're only bluffing.
Do your worst.

- Units 17...
- They intend to break through to the north.
"- Yes, that was to be expected."
- How are you going to prevent that?
We only have a handful of men left.
It would be suicide.
"Oh, yeah?"
"If Ramírez's position in the north is strengthened, we can't hold out, whether we have 10 or 1, OOO men."
The refinery will be destroyed.
"- Would you like a bite, Padre Julio?"
- First you must tell me where you got it.
- Stealing is not a very nice thing to do.
"- Maybe, but it's better than being hungry."
"- Can I talk to you for a minute, Padre?"
"- Sure, go ahead."
"Your food supplies are scarce, and it won't get any better in the near future."
"It would be a great risk for everyone involved, but if you do me a favour, I'll help you get these people across the border."
I like that suggestion.
- Tell me what your motives are.
- We'll be honest with you.
We're planning a coup.
We want to destroy the Marbella refinery.
That would be a great gain.
All traffic would be brought to a halt.
- Ramírez would be finished.
- But Marbella can't be destroyed.
- You've been trying to do that for two years.
- I've got something I didn't have before.
I suppose you know the story of the Trojan Horse.
"I don't know what it has to do with this, but I'm sure you'll explain."
Think about who might be the Trojan Horse.
It will be you.
Bet you no one's told you that.
"Yeah, yeah."
"Yep, don't let that worry you none too much."
"You know, are you lonely for a car?"
I get lonely when I don't have a car.
"But I'm not lonely anymore, 'cause at Diaz Motors I've got plenty of friends."
You don't got to knock.
I know what you're after.
Come on in.
Yeah?
You are scared shitless.
What did you know about that?
There's just the matter of this job you come to do.
"Six reported incidences of harassing motorists, two with brutality."
"Then there's you, crossing the line."
"No, that ain't it."
"It's been a long time coming, Leland, the way you've been running things."
"If you ain't scared of what needs to be done, then you ain't got no clue why you're here."
I got sent here to replace you.
"Maybe a day too late, but replace you nonetheless."
"You got sent here because it's your punishment, Wallace."
"Taking your statement, is all."
"You fetch me some water, would you?"
Hmm?
Hm.
You have no idea what that... that boy Clive was threatening to bring.
"These horrible people doing immoral things, and now they're creeping across the border, threatening to make the boogeyman a real thing."
It's enough to give you a good start.
It'll make you want to wait for all the bad things to come get you.
I don't regret what happened.
Takes a willing hand to punish horrible men.
"They're building a case, Le."
No-no-no-no-no-no!
You can't leave me alone with those kids!
"We had a deal, Lois!"
"You are in charge of the spiritual and emotional development, discipline and scary injuries."
"I kill spiders, mark their heights on the door frames and supply car snacks."
You walk out now and the whole system falls apart!
"I can't do it, Hal."
I don't want to.
I just don't have it anymore.
"I mean, it's normal, right?"
"People give up, they quit..."
"Lois, you listen to me."
No one is as good as you are.
"You took those vicious little fiends, and you twisted and crushed them into submission."
And you didn't do it because you had to.
"You did it because you loved the game, and it was beautiful!"
I just don't have that anymore.
"Honey, yes, you do."
I know you do.
You just lost your way a little.
You just need to think.
Think back to the first time you found that spark.
There's got to be some way to remember.
And I'm going to help you.
"So, here I am."
Dad said you needed some help on something?
"Francis, your father and I are trying to remember something, and we really need your help."
We'd like you to think back to your earliest memories.
What's this all about?
Mind your own business.
"Just do it, will ya?"
You've got to be kidding me.
I know.
"They should stop that, by the way."
How long had you been in a relationship with the man?
I did know him.
"""I did know him"" - that's awesome!"
Had you gone to Vegas with him?
Yeah.
"If you want a divorce, do you have to do it through the States or can you come back and stand in a court in England and go,"
"""I was dressed as Elvis and he was dressed as..."""
The first thing I did when I filed for divorce was I made my lawyers check that I was married.
That really fucked him off.
Because I didn't believe that you could get married so quickly.
It took about three minutes.
"Oh, yeah - it's Vegas, baby!"
I perform in Vegas only once a year and I got to know the lady that owns the Little White Wedding Chapel and she's owned it for 50 years and she is a nut.
I love her and it's crazy.
It's 24 hours a day they're open.
They never close.
They always have at least two Elvises on duty ready to marry you.
Right?
Classic Vegas bit.
Did you get married by an Elvis?
"No, I was married by a man called the Reverend Wayne Splendid."
Of course you were!
Reverend Splendid.
You knew it was true love right there.
It sounds really bad when you say it.
Have you met Father Extraordinary?
I actually don't think it matters whether you got married in three minutes or whether you got married in...
"You did the whole thing where you got engaged and announced it and then you go through, like, two years of pissing everyone off with your John Lewis list."
I don't think it matters.
You would say that.
Yeah.
"Yeah, put those on."
Excuse me?
"Uh, he said put them on."
Who the hell you guys think you are?
What did Dawkins offer you to help him escape from prison today?
I don't know what you're talking about.
"Billy, so help me God, you answer incorrectly one more time,"
I'm gonna put those scrubs on you myself and then drop you in general population.
How long you think you'll last there?
You can't do that.
This here says I can.
"Dawkins said that if I helped him, he'd give me 50 grand."
And you believed him?
"He arranged for $10,000 to be wired into my account."
He told me it was everything he had.
I'd get the rest as soon as he got out.
Where'd he say the rest of the money was coming from?
I don't know.
"All he told me was that there was a lot of it waiting for him on the outside, but in order to get it, he needed to get out today."
I'm Detective Williams;
this is Commander McGarrett.
We hear you and Walton Dawkins were neighbors.
"Yeah, four and a half years."
Warden says you guys used to be pretty tight.
"Well, in the non-Biblical sense, if you dig what I'm saying."
So what happened?
Why the beef?
I didn't appreciate him trying to gut me with a shiv last week.
He said I was asking too many questions.
Questions have anything to do with why he bounced today?
"You know, it's possible I may have some pertinent information, but, uh, you gonna have to play me for it."
"If she were to return to Bangkok, she would be reunited with a band of exploitive drug runners."
The odds of her surviving are minimal.
The odds of her living a normal life are zero.
"You honor, we cannot grant asylum based on an individual's socioeconomic situation, or a lack of family."
We just can't.
"You honor, with the help of social services, we have found a responsible couple willing to take care of kalaya."
"If she were to stay here, she would have a chance to live a normal life..."
A chance to be a person...
And not a 62 pound heroin suitcase.
[Knock on door]
Hey.
Thank you for-- for not telling my mom.
"No, thank you for bringing it back."
"Look, uh..."
"Nick, the whole reason I took-- no, you don't need to tell me, Jeremy."
"Well, I'm in trouble at, uh, at school with some kids."
What do you mean?
"Well, the thing is I met these kids, uh, from easton, and they take bets on like, uh, like sports games and stuff."
Making book?
"Yeah, yeah."
Making-- making book.
"And, uh, I'm kind of like-- kind of like the representative at my school."
Ok.
Shut the door and sit down.
"And so, this kid..."
"He bets $5,000 on the alamo bowl over/under."
Right?
And loses?
"It's 44, the over/under, right?"
"And there's, like, 10 seconds left in the game and the score is 23 to 20, and so, everything's good."
You know?
"But then, the quarterback, he fumbles-- ok, just get to the point, Jeremy."
Benvolio?
What brings you here to me at dead of night?
My care for one you love.
"The good lord Romeo, he waits by Juliet's tomb, all full of woe."
Why talk of woe?
Say rather joy.
"How joy, when all his love and life are in the grave?"
Did he not receive my letter?
What letter's that?
"Is that you, Tybalt, in that mortal sleep?"
"Forgive me, cousin, for the harm I did."
"There is no reparation more than this, that I shall kill the man who once killed you."
Leaving this sweet corpse is trial enough.
"Oh, my love."
My wife.
It is time to join you in all eternity.
"Juliet, why are you still so fair?"
Death that has sucked the honey of your breath has had no power as yet to spoil your beauty.
Shall I believe he has a plan in this?
"That insubstantial Death is amorous, keeping you perfect for his paramour?"
"For fear of that, I will still stay with thee."
And never from this palace of dim night depart again.
Eyes...
look your last.
Arms... take your last embrace.
And lips...
"the doors of breath, be forever sealed with a righteous kiss."
"Come, bitter conduct."
"Come, unsavory guide."
Here's to my love.
"Oh, true apothecary, thy drugs are quick."
Juliet.
"Yeah, in seventh grade."
"Well, then, you know that Brandon is a seriously great pianist."
"Like, seriously great."
"Like, even when I'm so sick of hearing him practice the same thing over and over again, that I think if I hear it one more time I might puncture my own eardrum,"
I can step back and recognize that it's actually pretty amazing.
"- Oh, I remember."
He's super good.
"- He writes, too."
"We could use your help with something, actually."
"- No, I don't think..."
"- Tightening up the sound, maybe get a few of the songs charted."
"So, what, we play the same stale version every time?"
"Well, that's only how it starts."
"Once you know it, you can really play around."
"Unless you guys like the fact that you most of the time sound like you're rehearsing, basically."
"You're welcome not to attend our shows, if you don't like what we do."
"No, he didn't mean, um..."
"no, he's a musician too."
Classical.
"Well, maybe you're just a little too buttoned-up to get what we're about."
- Wow.
She's...
- Intense.
Yeah.
"And I've got, like, 30 seconds to follow her before she quits the band again."
"But dude, you got to come jam with us sometime."
I don't think it's my thing.
And it's definitely not her thing.
Just think about it.
We could probably use a little buttoning-up.
- What is it?
- We're in a car.
This bank will charge interest.
Biji has woken up.
If you can't knock like a civilized person have the courtesy to look away.
Slut!
Where the fuck do you think you are going!
Sit here!
I thought my old mother had gone senile!
Then one day I asked myself how long since Sarika nagged you?
She seems content!
What has changed?
I has my eye on you but you sensed it some how!
Clever slut that you are...
But you couldn't resist for long eh!
Today I am going to knock you back to your senses!
Oye!
Sit!
Mother fucker.
Watch and learn!
Usually you are of no use does seeing me with him turn you on?
You pervert!
If you think you are going to fuck around behind my back..
..and make me look like a fool...
then think again.
'l was scared to go back to my aunt's house.'
'l needn't have been for Sarika's husband had already dug my grave.'
Mukesh had come home in the afternoon to ask Sarika for a loan.
Said that he was not being treated well by you.
That you do not give him proper food nor any pocket money.
Inspite of our constraints we try to do our best for him...
He had been working well up till now so Sarika felt sorry for him.
At his age boys tend to mistake sympathy from women for an interest of another kind.
"Yes, boys at this age can indeed be very foolish."
We'll have to go over the whole system when we get back.
"All right, try and contact Tarrant now."
SOOLIN: (Over radio) Tarrant.
"Tarrant, come in please."
Avon certainly chooses his moments.
"Well, at least they've fixed the teleport."
And we've had a demonstration of the Federation's new weapon.
- Isn't there any defence against it?
- Only to shoot first.
We can move out of here soon.
They won't run another census today.
What did I say?
Didn't I tell you Tarrant would blow it?
We don't know that for certain.
"Right now, he's probably strung up while they thread red hot filaments through his nerve centres, if he's got any."
"It'll be, ""Where'd you come from?"
How'd you get here?
"Are there any more like you?"""
"For pity's sake, Avon, get this ship moving while we still have a chance."
"Slave, I want an infrared surface sweep every 30 seconds."
Immediate notification of any launchings.
"At once, Master."
- That'll be too late.
- I don't think so.
We can't be sure that anything has happened to them.
Maybe it just wasn't convenient for them to answer.
"Right, like their arms are being pulled out at the shoulders."
"Vila, until we are attacked, we are staying."
"Blake would have been proud of you, you know."
I know.
But then he never was very bright.
(Beeping)
There is something else that they're hiding about this patient.
I'll be able to tell once I open him up.
- I'm going to do an open abdominal surgery.
Get the operating room ready.
- Yes.
Hands off!
I can't let you do that.
I can't let you operate on him.
The president's doctor will be here in an hour.
What do you mean?
He won't last an hour.
If I don't operate now... not even 20 minutes.
I can't allow just anyone to put a knife through the leader of the Arab world.
You are not listening.
He will die if I don't operate in 20 minutes.
Hands off!
Only Arab doctors can operate on President Mubarak.
"Everyone, hands off, and step away."
Fine.
I'm not trying to change history here.
"But as soon as I take my hands off, he will die."
His blood pressure is dropping even further.
Listen carefully.
Whether he lives or dies is not the matter here.
The point is who will take responsibility for it.
Do what the Arabs want.
"So if the patient dies, we can give the responsibility to the doctor for not operating as her personal mistake."
Our force will not intervene at all costs.
This is an order.
Can you save this patient?
What?
"I won't know for sure until I open him up, but somewhere in the biliary tree, there is bleeding--"
"I mean, he's kind of the guy who connects old basketball with modern basketball and had such a recall of all that."
It sort of defined the essence of the man.
"And that at the end of his life, it leaves him."
"Dean Smith passed away on February 8, 2015."
"Dean Smith passed away on February 8, 2015."
"Tributes poured in from all over the country, from friends and rivals."
"And, on February 22nd, the Dean dome was filled in his honor one final time,"
at a memorial service to remember north Carolina's beloved coach.
Thank you.
Thank you for what you did for Carolina.
Thank you for what you did for college basketball.
You showed us how to live.
You showed us how to be engaged.
You showed us how to be engaged.
"You set an example to show people how, through determination, to never give up, to never quit, to keep pushing forward."
Look at Dean Smith.
What composure.
"This man is very much in control of himself, his team."
Gets the 20.
Has a little discussion with his guys.
It has been a program to be envied.
"Dean's trying to say, ""attention!"
He's trying to kill the guy!
It should be a 2-hot foul!
"He's mugging him!"""
Push it up.
That's the shot Williams loves.
Push it up.
That's the shot Williams loves.
And he puts the tar heels ahead by one.
What is the impact that coach Smith has had on us?
"There's not one or two things, it's our life."
"Even if you refuse, I'll shake hands with you."
"You couldn't catch me in India, how can you catch me in Malaysia?"
"Aren't you over expecting, partner?"
"When I've come so far using your clue, can't I come to you, partner?"
You can't!
"I'm giving you another opportunity, catch me before December 16th, after that even if you want to catch me, I won't get caught."
This is your last opportunity.
"Thanks, I gave that interview to lure you,"
"I know you'll call me back, and you got caught."
"You gave a good knock-out punch, I'm your fan."
"Hello partner, you've made me run long distance,"
"I'm new to Malaysia, where do you want me to go?"
Want me to take right or left side?
I'll take the left side.
"Partner, helicopter also to catch me?"
You've so much power here?
I need to speed up.
I need to run!
Why are you so moody?
- Is it about him?
- No.
"New movie has opened, shall we go?"
No mood.
It's him!
Why is he entering hospital?
"This is a special case from India, he has forgotten the past with a blockage after being hit on head."
"He's under observation, take care of him."
What's this silly meeting going on here?
Somebody has hijacked my patient.
Why are you staring at me?
I'll rip out your skin if you don't answer me.
"He's missing since two days, I've high BP also."
Major lord!
Major lord!
The decay of my nervous system is the consequence of partisans' constant harassment.
I may not burden my kind hosts with withal.
Let's go.
"When Tót family they got home with the major, who did not stand on his foot already."
He tolerated that the host and his wife should make it undress helplessly.
"let it be washed with tender hands let his whole body be dried throughout let it nurse, coddle let it be dressed in pyjamas, let it be invested in a bed."
He slept in faint unconsciousness already by the time it was covered up.
Mariska with Ágika did the washing ironed always yet around p.m.6 o'clocks.
The guest put his thing in order.
Tót was not able to keep the curious ones at a distance.
"Very much not good, that lies on his heart."
He presses it.
He has what kind of correct small foot.
It is very normal foot.
"- I did not say it, that not normal."
- Not it.
But watching too small.
- I was watching too small?
- You.
I was surprised at the fact that a human foot may be like this only.
How so?
I said no bad one.
The single very normal one and... healthy foot.
- Do not be trying to be clever.
The foot of all majors is like this.
"Very much not good, that lies on his heart."
He moved.
He sat up.
- Good bye.
Good bye.
I'm her big brother.
Mind stepping out for a sec?
"Go, go."
I'm sorry.
"Um, would you mind leaving us, too?"
I'm sorry.
Why are you doing porn?
What about school?
I still go.
It was right after I was admitted that the tsunami hit.
"Our fish factory was swept away, and Dad couldn't work, remember?"
But you said you'll get a part-time job to pay off the tuition.
I was doing that.
"After class, I worked at a store, then waitressed 'til morning."
I was so tired I slept in class.
"I wanted to be a nursery teacher, but I could barely study."
"I thought about hostess work, but I didn't want the town knowing."
So you chose porn?
I saw an online ad for a porn gig in Tokyo.
"I knew it'd be tough, but they pay for travel, so I applied."
They replied and said the director can meet me nearby.
He's known for doing POV videos with amateur girls on the road.
"They agreed to blur my face, and paid 150,000 yen."
"I started coming to Tokyo on weekends, and I paid off my tuition in no time."
I was shocked when I first came here.
"Only half a year after the tsunami, and people went on like nothing had happened."
"On TV they all called for solidarity, but in the end, no one really cared."
How's Dad's depression?
He's fine with medication.
He's in Fukushima doing decontamination work.
Mom's at the fish cake factory that restarted.
"If they're both working, why do you do this?"
"So it has to be perfect, you see."
It has to be perfect.
It can't be impatient.
It's timeless.
I wanted to ask you.
Do you think...
did anybody know that Lou had three families all at once?
"No, I didn't."
"As a matter of fact, for years I didn't know Lou was married."
- Really?
- Yeah.
That was part of his mystery.
My mother and I lived on the outskirts of Philadelphia at the end of a secluded road.
"Lou would visit every once in a while, mostly at night."
We never knew quite when it would be.
He'd call at the last minute and say he was on his way.
My mother would frantically whip up a five-course meal and have a Martini in a frozen glass waiting for him.
"I got to stay up late, and Lou would tell me wonderful stories about India and elephants and tigers."
"In the middle of the night, we'd all bundle into the car and drive him back downtown."
I'd lie in the backseat.
We were all silent.
"When I asked my mother why we couldn't all live together, she explained that his wife wouldn't give him a divorce."
Why didn't he just run away?
We'd stop at the end of Clinton Street and let him out.
"He'd walk down the block and disappear into the dark house, his wife's house."
Her name was Esther.
"They had a daughter named Sue, who was 20 years older than me."
"When I was in first grade,"
"I found out I had another half sister, Alex."
Her mother was a lady named Anne.
Then there was my mother and me.
Lou was 61 when I was born.
- Prime numbers!
"Two, three, five, no nine."
- They're beautiful!
How'd you do that?
- I had them made just for you.
- They were done very fast.
- Thank you.
Well...
"I've wanted to ask you something, and I can only say this once..."
Sit down.
We have a lot in common.
"Some variables will remain unknown, as is the case with most complex equations."
"Greg, talk to me."
I'm not saying this right.
"This feeling you have for Alex, it won't be the same with me."
"You won't have that ache in your stomach, because we're not in love."
I think we share a genuine affection for each other.
We share a passion for knowledge rather than a physical passion.
"Although, if sex is something that interests you,"
"I'm sure I could provide that on occasion, given enough warning."
- What are you saying?
- We were both in love and miserable.
"It's a waste, because as people, we're valuable."
"When I look at you, I see a woman unlike any I've ever known before."
"Your mind, your humor, your passion for ideas."
I'm very fond of you.
"When I'm with you, I feel as if I'm home."
So I think we should get married.
People marry for sex or beauty.
Are my reasons more insane than those?
Are you in shock or just appalled?
Blink if you can hear me.
"We got to do something quick, or Bernie's going to roll right across that river and wipe us off the map."
- You want to save your home?
- Of course.
People love an underdog.
Maybe we can give them something to believe in again.
- Are you gonna do it?
- I'm not gonna tell him.
"Come on, dude, I told him last time."
- Here he comes.
- We're next anyway.
"- All right, guys, listen up."
- Bring it in.
Here's my plan.
We work in their businesses.
We get good grades.
"We stay out of trouble, mostly."
"But that's not enough, no."
"We have to make this town love us again, men."
Remind them what we're made out of.
We have to become champions if we want to win that vote.
- So we're joining the junior league.
- Join?
What does he...
"We'll take down the Hounds, win over this town and save our home."
"Little enthusiasm here, guys?"
"Well, I mean..."
Where are the little dudes?
That CFS lady came and got them.
She says they've been fostered.
Sorry.
"As a mother, Dickie, I simply could not abide the thought of these tiny youngsters living in such awful conditions."
"So while the good people of Charlestown decide the fate of the decrepit Newman Home, they will reside with me until a more permanent situation arises."
And just because no one ever wants to try with you doesn't give you the right to tell me how to run my associates!
"I got an offer for more money than I'll see my whole life, and you want me to turn it down based on a feeling that whatever happened to Chris happened to other people?"
You're dating your therapist.
"I don't need a lecture from you, Louis."
Does Donna have any idea about the two of you?
"No, she doesn't, and for right now, I'd like to keep it that way."
"Harvey, is there something that you're not telling me?"
'Cause it seems like you've been different lately.
"We win this, you're gonna be Andy Dufresne sitting on a beach in Mexico with a bank account full of cash."
I already make a nice living in here.
I was thinking maybe some of that money might go to your daughter.
I wasn't lying about working a case with Oliver.
I just didn't tell you which one.
- The prison one?
- Yeah.
- This is a fireable offense.
- Harvey isn't gonna fire me.
"Yeah, but maybe he should."
What is your word worth?
"The way things are going, it's not gonna be worth very much."
♪♪ Dramatic music...
Hey.
Hey.
How long have you been up?
A while.
I've been thinking about what you said to me last night.
"Mike, I didn't mean to be so harsh."
"No, you were right."
My word does mean everything to me... which is why I'm gonna keep helping Oliver.
What?
"When I gave my word to Harvey, I meant it."
"But before that, I gave my word to Oscar Reyes."
You weren't there.
"You don't know, but I know."
"She had H.D.H.D. because of what I did, and then these rages started."
She has them over nothing.
And someone told you that her behavior was related to your drug use?
"The school counselor said that it's adolescence, but I know what it is."
"I've read enough, and she's been tested and tested and... and there's nothing else."
It's me.
"Michelle... look, I know that you feel guilty and that you feel hurt and that you would do anything to change what happened, to change how you're feeling right now."
But sometimes... you just have to push forward.
Darren is the strong one.
I want to talk to him.
"We've been through all of this together, and without him, I can't do it."
I can't.
"He's in a coma, and then..."
Tammy's gonna be taken away.
I'm just losing everyone I love.
"We had a therapeutic fencing match, and I lost."
"She distracted me with the baby, who is quite winning and has my ears."
They're my ears.
What am I gonna do now?
Can I make an observation?
I don't know.
Can you?
"I know you're upset, so I'm just gonna ignore that."
"You told Violet you were going to leave, and you never did."
"You know, you talk, you send people over."
Violet's smart.
She knows she doesn't have twalk out that door because you are always gonna walk back in.
Definitely my ears.
Hey.
There's a juvie officer here that wants to take Tammy.
Father?
"Yes, it's me,"
Juan.
"""Juan had seen the future... and he couldn't live with it""."
Are you sure you don't want to work for us?
"I appreciate your offer, but I'd prefer to return to my own time."
"If you have something to tell me, say it."
I'm letting you know that if you go back... nothing good awaits you.
"I'm going to die,right?"
It doesn't matter.
"I want to see my child grow even if it's just for one more day, that's worth anything that could happen to me."
Thank you for everything.
-Good luck.
"""I, like Juan, also wanted to know my future."""
At the store they told me that my house was abandoned and that they didn't know anything about my family.
So I was left with only one way to find out anything.
"I never should have done it""."
Yes?
"There's a man here with a court summons in my name, as the head of the Ministry."
That's not possible.
This ministry is secret from the state.
"-I have come to defend the interests of the direct decedents of rabbi Abraham Levi, author or ""The Book of Doors""."
It's you.
-Will you protect my family?
"-Five days, not one more."
"On the next day, this Ministry will no longer be a secret."
And what are we going to do?
You must travel to 1491 and save the rabbi from the stake.
What are we waiting for?
It's not that easy.

Why don't you come by any time?
My opinion could unsettle you.
You could tell me something about the lyrics.
Be sure I will.
So you're not that bad?
I'm always complaining.
It's the very first thing that psychiatrists teach you.
To complain about everything.
Since the moment they tell you you're dominated by the subconscious you start playing the victim of everything.
"If I knew, I'd have visited you."
But I was really taken care of in the sanitarium.
"Besides, Laura was so kind to me."
"She worked, took care of all the expenses..."
She visited me frequently.
The only bad situation...
Took place when I went back home.
I can't blame Laura.
She's much younger than me.
And two years is too much time.
"The thing is when I was back, she had a lover."
I didn't say a thing to her when she told me.
She told me she was incapable of leaving her lover.
And I accepted.
I would've accepted anything from her.
I felt so grateful.
I felt an infinite debt to her.
"Moreover, I was so used to see Laura as the head of the family... that for a little time I was the one cleaning the house."
I can assure you I did it better than her.
The truth is I couldn't do anything else.
I couldn't go out.
The mere fact of deciding to do anything was below the threshold.
You're not even worth killing.
Shut up!
You're the same as me.
So why are you trying to be a normal guy now?
You make me want to puke.
I'm telling you to shut up!
"No, I'm telling you."
"Ever since you met those guys at Mithril and at that school, you've become worthless."
You've gotten pulled in by those worthless scum and become a bore.
"I just told you a little while ago that you were frustrated, right?"
That's their fault.
"Their so- called ""humanism."""
The assassin-saint Kashim I knew would never fit in there.
You're being suckered by them.
Listen.
The weak are parasites of the strong.
"They dazzle you with words like ""kind friend"" and ""trust,"""
and then they suck your strength until there's nothing left.
Tell me your true feelings.
Do you really enjoy being with a bunch of weaklings?
"Come on, answer me."
I'm asking you if you really enjoy being with a bunch of weaklings.
Well?
I'm telling you to shut the hell up!
So you don't even have the drive to kill me?
I'm going to die soon.
And I plan on bringing others down with me.
I ordered Yu Fang to go berserk in Hong Kong until the whole city is a sea of flames.
And I ordered Yu Lan to get rid of the biggest cancer of all... the one that caused your downfall.
Cancer?
"The woman, Kashim."
Haven't you heard yet?
Everyone does.
"Uh,rick."
"Strange,isn't it,rick,someone committed a murder standard."
But then they covered it up standard.
And then they uncovered it.
Far from standard.
You think my we was involved.
No.
And that's the problem.
James was a big man there is no way that I could've picked him up and buried him.
"Oh,that's easy."
You roll him onto the plastic and you drag him out.
Without ruining these nails?
Look at them they are so perfect.
I tried to convince agent gibbs that your wife was telling the truth.
I'm afraid he doesn't lieve me.
"Tell me,rick,why does that please you?"
What?
"Well,you just flashed a slight,reflexive smile when I said that gibbs didn't believe your wife."
I did not.
Timothy?
I'm afraid he doesnt believe me.
"I don't know if god was watching your wife and finn thanight, but you re."
My-my wife and the dead guy?
"Yes,when your wife ran out of the house, you buried the body."
"My god,man,why would I do that?"
Because you wanted the money.
"Well,you had to wt until her father died before you could implicate her in the murder."
"But once she got her inheritance, you disinterred the body."
"You-u have a vivid imagination,ducky."
"But,uh,imagination don't prove anything."
"No,you're quite right there."
Listen to me!
"Right now, your body is suffering pain just like a vampire."
"But unlike the others, it's only your body that's afflicted, not your soul!"
That's why you can do this.
That's your humanity.
"If you truly want to be human, then you've got to reach down deep and cling to that!"
I'll do it!
"Whatever you say, old man."
But don't think I'll give up my revenge!
NOAH:
"I heard the stories long ago, but I never believed them."
"Stories of a miraculous child,"
born of both human and vampire.
"h' this was indeed that boy, the miracle was he survived at all."
(GROANING)
You're not a pile of ash!
"Noah, would you please teach me how to fight them?"
"I have no need of an apprentice, Eric."
But I do have an opening for a partner.
If you're interested.
We've been traveling the world killing all manner of vampire ever since.
"He came to be called ""Blade"" for his weapon sometime afterwards."
That's heartwarming.
It still doesn't change the fact that he killed my father.
So you want revenge.
"He was a hunter, too?"
What if I do?
You're wrong.
What you're really trying to do is run away.
"Yeah, from what?"
"As vampire hunters, we fight not only the darkness in others, but also that in ourselves."
"It's a part of us, and there's no getting away from it, no matter how far you run."
"Frank, I will jam that poop right back up your ass where it came from."
You know in that bed...
"Guys, guys, guys, clearly, we're exhausted and full of emotion, but we should not be threatening each other with jamming feces into each other's assholes, okay?"
Wait a minute.
"Wait, wait."
Hold on a second.
"What if we had them produce another sample, and we cross-reference the samples?"
They'd have to do it in front of us so that there's no foul play.
I can't go now.
Really?
I could probably squeeze something out.
I'll get some newspaper.
This is exciting.
This is very exciting.
"Why, of all places, are we here?"
"Because it's your bar, and we're gonna drink for free."
"Well, damn it, waitress, that is not what I wanted."
How?
How do you still not know what my name is?
!
"Oh, I'm sorry."
I'm supposed to be expected to rember everyone's name at all moments of the day.
This is the opposite of where we're supposed to be.
"Oh, Dee, we were just on the verge of a major breakthrough."
He was turtle-heading.
Turtle-heading!
"No, there was no turtles anywhere."
Were you just pooping on the floor?
"No, I was not."
"That was an endurance contest, which I won, by the way..."
- You're paying for that.
- She doesn't have to pay for that.
Our representative will tell you the conditions.
Since you say you live day by day to protect your pride...
I don't want to hurt that.
Out of the 80 tenants who are not moving out of the culture district...
To the first ten tenants who sign their agreements and come here...
I will give 40 million won.
What did you say?
Then what about the rest of us?
We will give it to the first ten tenants who come back with the agreement.
What the hell are you saying?
You horrible human being...
"If you're going to do it, give it to all of us."
"First come, first served?"
"After this, it's very possible that I won't give you a cent."
The most diligent of you will protect their pride with their 40 million won.
"- Oh, my..."
- What is this...
So you're trying to put us against each other?
"We have no reason to be swindled by this, let's just go."
"- Come on, let's go."
- Let's go together.
Why aren't you coming?
What do you plan on doing with that 40 million won?
"Honey, come on!"
But what if we really come out with nothing after this?
"We did fine so far, making ends meet!"
- Come!
- I don't know!
"Mr. President, you've finished planning our mission in your head, haven't you?"
"This time, we'll need Chan Gyu to take on an important role."
I'll do anything you ask.
"Thank you, Chan Gyu."
He is buying all the real estate he can get his hands on.
How much do you want for it?
This is not a gas filling station.
The mega-centre is not for sale.
I won't offer it twice.
I'm not a parrot either.
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!
Why are you standing here?
Get in the cars and let's go!
Illychenko could have done it too.
He is a new oligarch and a member of parliament.
This issue will be decided at the highest level.
I respect you and the highest level.
"But it seems to me that we're living in a democratic country, aren't we?"
We are.
But democracy is not permissiveness.
One may pay dearly for one's self-confidence.
I agree with you.
Do you know how I got here?
I headed a department in a mental hospital.
I was to retire in a year.
I was silly enough not to acknowledge the fact that a young mediocre specialist had bought the post of the head doctor and stolen everything in the hospital away.
I wrote to the Ministry of Health and to the General Prosecutor's Office about it.
So here I am!
I'm waiting for the court hearing with broken ribs.
I'm accused of dealing drugs.
But I'm grateful to those who sent me here.
For here I got to know what real freedom is.
I have lots of free time.
I read the Bible from beginning to end here for the first time both the Old and the New Testaments.
Don't you hate those who broke your ribs?
-Turnbull is a good man.
"-Yeah, well, let's cut out the bullshit."
I don't want to spend more time here than I have to.
You can have the license.
"The price is 250,000 dollars."
"Plus five per cent of the gross monthly of all four hotels, Mr. Corleone."
"The price for the license is less than 20,000 dollars, right?"
That's right.
-Why would I pay more than that?
-Because I intend to squeeze you.
I don't like your kind of people.
I don't like to see you come out to this clean country in oily hair dressed up in those silk suits and try to pass yourselves off as decent Americans.
"I'll do business with you, but the fact is that I despise your masquerade, the dishonest way you pose yourself and your whole fucking family."
"Senator, we're both part of the same hypocrisy."
But never think it applies to my family.
"All right, all right."
Some people have to play little games.
You play yours.
Let's say that you'll pay me because it's in your interest.
I want your answer and the money by noon tomorrow.
One more thing.
"Don't you contact me again, ever."
From now on you deal with Turnbull.
"Open that door, son."
"Senator, you can have my answer now if you like."
My offer is this...
Nothing.
"Not even the fee for the gaming license, which I would like you to put up."
"Good afternoon, gentlemen."
Ladies!
I didn't know you were out here.
"-Honey, we have to go."
You want me to say it again?
No... nice words shouldn't be repeated a second time.
"Then, are you willing to help me, for the sake of our Love Me Dept's reputation?"
I don't know if I can help you.
"After all, you created this problem yourself."
"However... in the eyes of an actor, a script is the bible."
There's no doubt whatsoever.
An actor just needs to perform according to the script and he's all set.
"Then, have you never doubted a script before?"
What's the use of doubting?
It won't change anything.
The other actors will all follow the script to perform.
That's the only way the show can go on.
The other actors will all follow the script to perform.
Why didn't I ever think of that?
What do you mean?
Let's do that!
I apologize for making everyone wait.
It's all right.
We've already prepared ourselves for this to be a waste of time.
"You're not even from the industry, how impressive could you be?"
Exactly.
How you ever got into LME is a big mystery.
Of course it was by brown-nosing and shamelessly hounding the CEO.
Love Me Ba Bu is basically headquarters for parasites.
"Gong Xi jie, good luck!"
Don't lose to them.
Mary.
Listen up.
"If you screw up and give that herd of subpar women an excuse to look down their noses at our Love Me Dept, you're dead."
I'll do my best.
Go on.
All right Mr. Zachary
I'll text you tomorrow.
Why are you leaving?
Because I have to work tomorrow.
And you're just going to leave me with your friend in there?
"Hey ZACH, where's your corkscrew?"
Ok...
Ok...
She just showed up hours later unannounced.
I guess something did happen between them the other night.
What did ZACH say?
Well I mean he said he wanted me to stay and you know but I think I was just playing dumb.
"I don't get you Dale, I really don't."
Why?
Why don't you just go for him?
Because Seven I'm done having meaningless relationships with these loser LA guys and on and on and on...
Whoa... is a loser LA guy?
"No he's... no he's not but anyhow I'm not his type, especially now that Hallie's all over him."
You are so wrong.
You are so wrong.
It doesn't matter because hey I'm going to go out on a date with Haden.
"Whoa whoa, whoa"
But just as friends.
You're going out with Haden?
The fake seeking personal trainer whose only using you to get ahead in this desperate city.
Oh shit Seven that's harsh.
He just wants to schmooze you so you'll listen to his stupid reality show concept.
He's only interested in seeing what you can do for him and his career because you have a career
The only reason Hallie is into Zach is because you gave her the Ok to pursue
I never said pursue.
She asked me if we had ever hooked up and I said no...
Look I never said this to you before but you are going to regret this...
"Well, I'm going to Philadelphia."
"Well, I could take you as far as..."
That farmhouse there.
"And that's very nice of you, but maybe I'll just wait for some form of transportation that involves combustion."
I understand.
"But if you change your mind, I'll be at..."
That farmhouse there.
"Yes, but you see, if that's as far as you're going, then it does me no good."
That is true.
"But my intent was just, and my heart is pure."
Also does me no good.
"Frankly, that's the best darn pea soup I've ever had."
"Well, it's the soup that brings you in, but it's the pie keeps you here forever."
I was only three hours from home.
Oh.
Oh!
That is delicious!
What kind is this?
Pie.
Pie.
"Well, you know, with food this good, you must have people lining up to get in here."
"Truth is, we're probably going to have to close her down."
Irene?
I'm afraid it's true.
"I mean, ever since they built the new highway, folks kind of just blow by this town."
"You know, they wouldn't if they knew how good your soup and pie are."
I told you that.
"Okay, now, I don't know if this is anything, but when I was driving through Texas,"
"I started noticing all these signs advertising the world's best chili, and, like, every mile, there would be another sign that would say, like,"
"""100 miles to the world's best chili."""
"""99 miles. 98 miles."""
"So by the time I finally got there,"
"It is about Jayaraj sir, who is recharging instead of relaxing at his age."
You said that was a yellow magazine.
Now the matter has spread to media.
What would public think about sir?
"Boss, I got an idea to solve this problem."
I got a doubt to say it to you or madam.
You promised on Hanuman and gave a word to this brother.
You need to tell me that idea.
Simple!
What if we bring that sadist husband and soft wife in front of the media and make them say that are husband and wife?
- Problem will be solved.
You said half and I said half.
But the whole credit is mine.
"Love you, king."
"Jai, continuous phones from all the channels regarding this matter."
I am unable to understand what to do.
"- Relax, Vasu!"
"I told you to leave it, right?"
Not leaving sir.
I got a wonderful idea.
"If you like it and use it, you should gift me an Alto car."
I will give you an Audi car.
Tell what is that?
"If we bring that sadist in the photo and that site  that lady in front of the media and make them say to be husband and wife and also that sir is genuine, all the doubts will be gone into the sewer."
Very good idea.
Mr Ratnam.
- Madam..
Track their address.
"Sir, Audi car!"
"This is injustice, sir."
Why do you beat me when you told you'll buy me an Audi car?
Actually I had to kill you for giving such an idea.
Stop.
It's a crime scene.
- Crime scene?
"Honey, you all right?"
- She's fine.
I am not fine.
I had to cancel my 1:00 showing.
MCGEE:
Think I found where he was buried.
"Checked for footprints, but it rained last night, so everything's pretty washed out."
You got access?
There's side access at street level.
"Chain link fence around the yard, but any one with gloves could have scaled it."
Wait for me!
The real estate agent solve the big mystery?
"No, but she owns the property with a contractor and every real estate agent in town had access."
I meant the mystery of how they expect to sell a house for 600 grand when it only has two and a half bathrooms.
"Well, you know what they say:"
"location, location... location."
"So, judging from the marks around the edges, looks like the digger used a garden spade."
"The soil's not real packed, so it would have been easy digging for a male or a female."
You see that?
Black plastic bags.
Garbage bags.
Body bag.
"Get it back to Abby, and a soil sample."
I want ground-penetrating radar.
"Uh, boss, those techs are booked weeks in advance."
I'm going to tell them it's an emergency and I will not budge until they show.
- Who's staying with McGee?
- I can.
If you want Tony to check out the other real estate women.
I can see that.
"Look, this really isn't a good time."
Could I at least say hello to Violet and the baby?
"You know, since I might be his father."
"I'm sorry, but this really isn't a good time."
Well...
That was Sheldon.
The rug is stained.
"Well, better coffee than blood, huh?"
You know what?
I'm not gonna go back to work yet.
You're not ready.
You're looking at me like I have crazy head.
And I don't.
I don't have crazy head.
I'm fine.
Go back to work.
You haven't been out of the house.
You don't answer the door.
I'm...
I'm fine.
You never want to hold the baby.
"Well, give me the baby."
"Pete, give me the baby."
"All right, Pete, you... you... you are understandably concerned because you're not sure of what's going on, so I'm gonna explain it to you."
"I am suffering from panic attacks, sleeplessness, agoraphobia and fear... all within the windows of behavior one expects from trauma victims."
However I...
"I'm not cognitively altered,"
"I am not utilizing unhealthy outlets for my feelings, such as drugs or inappropriate behaviors."
I am aware of my condition and feel a normal amount of concern for my well-being.
"I display few signs of improvement, but... but I also display no signs of dintegration."
"I have the number of two therapists, the housekeeper is coming by, and the baby can fit in the closet with me."
Go to the sea and then come to me in a couple of weeks.
Will you be able to come on the 29th in 5 p.m.?
- Yes.
- Brilliant!
Good luck to you.
Good bye.
Good bye.
What do we have here?
We checked your information.
You've never been detained by the police authorities.
You were never put behind the bars.
You were never accused of anything.
There is no criminal case against you.
You were never summoned to the police even as a witness.
But I was arrested by the police!
There was a major and a captain there who beat me and tortured me.
Then they called in a false witness and I was forced to confess to raping her!
Did you see their IDs?
Their surnames?
Their posts?
Do you know the address where it all had happened?
I saw no IDs.
I didn't see that place because they took me to it and out of it unconscious.
They beat me first and drugged me with something later.
It's very strange.
You don't know their surnames.
You don't know the address.
You don't remember where it happened.
You didn't make a photo of your bruises.
You didn't get a blood test to identify the drugs you were given.
You turned to us a week after it all happened.
Please state the facts on which I should open a criminal case.
You tell him his wife's not interested in how many times he was at it just that he was at it.
I want his story straight.
"Oh, by the way, if I don't see you later, have a good evening."
Is that a 'pointed remark'.
I don't know what you mean.
"Good, because if I get one more knowing bloody look from anyone in this station,"
I'm going to recommend your transfer to uniform.
Charlie?
Jack Frost.
"Fine no fine, how are you?"
"Listen, I've got to have a word with you."
Father will you hear my confession.
I was just about to lock up.
I've got to talk to someone.
CID is a plain clothes detective.
"So what sort of things do you detect, Jack."
"Stolen cars, burglaries?"
"You name it, I do it."
I don't guarantee to catch anyone though.
"Unfortunately, that's all too true, isn't it."
I beg your pardon?
We're told how hard the police work.
"But all we ever hear is, no resources."
Yeah well...
And when the people get caught the judges always seem to be on the side of the criminal.
"Even if you try to protect yourself, you're the one who's most likely to end up in jail."
We're not even safe in our own homes now.
"No that's true, especially if you consider rape or murder."
"There you go, even the police admit it."
Do you realize that most women are raped by people they know.
And most people are murdered by people they know.
"So statistically, you're safer with a complete stranger."
"Ohh... say, that's my supper you're eating!"
Shh.
I'm thinking.
The show bill!
You've got it!
Josie.
"Uncle daniel, come here."
Have you figured out yet how we're going to beat that injunction?
"No, he ain't!"
"Just when we need all the powers of glory pulling for us, his mind wanders to frivols and follies."
"Pleasure is the spice of business, uncle daniel."
It's as good as any picture could make of her.
"Still, it doesn't do her justice as a star temptation."
"You're dwelling in the fleshpots of egypt tonight, jimmy."
"But unless you find some way to get more stock, tomorrow we'll all be cast into a fiery furnace."
"Hey, boss-what about them bonds?"
What bonds?
Them confederate bonds.
They worked all right for us before.
"Ohh, get that ninny out of here!"
Wait.
"Confederate bonds... confederate, convertible!"
I told you luke's the brains of this organization.
"Jimmy, you got an idea!"
I see it!
You got an idea!
You bet i have.
There's nothing in the injunction that says that we can't print bonds.
What kind of bonds?
Convertible bonds.
"Well, what is a convertible bond, boss?"
A bond that you can convert into stock.
"I'd say don't profile me, but you're in a roomful of suspects,right?"
a city full.
victims abducted across every socioeconomic divide.
And this son of a bitch is about to burn a few of them alive.
"Problem is,we've gotta catch up."
And we know he's gonna be watching.
"Well,we're gonna bust him this year."
We've got two agents on the way to last night's crime scene.
Great.
I'll meet them there.
I hope we find something soon.
It gets dark early this time of year.
And we'll head to the morgue.
Hope you have a strong stomach.
Gasoline was the accelerant?
"Gas vapors collect in a low,enclosed space."
"When he ignited,those vapors burned down to his bone."
We call this a fourth-degree burn.
- There's a fracture on the back of his skull.
- That's right.
Was that postmortem?
"No,it was antemortem bruising."
He was struck from behind.
Blitz attack.
- What's this on her face?
- Charred fabric.
All of the victims have the same material on them.
"The fire fused the original garment to his flesh, then burned away,leaving behind these remains."
He's covering their faces?
"That's my best guess,yes."
"He doesn't want his victims looking at him, even though we wants to watch them die."
It could be a sign of guilt or inadequacy.
"Can I get a Maker's, neat?"
It's not easy to trust a man who's ready to fuck over his own grandmother.
"The kind of money we're talking about,"
I'd fuck over somebody I like.
[chuckling]
"Yeah, I get it."
And I got to hand it to you.
It almost worked.
Your plan has two fatal flaws.
One is my client Chayton Dockery.
Audrey took his cash collateral.
"And when he comes for it tomorrow, let's just say, if she's lucky, she goes to prison and all of her assets will be seized and the sale of the house will be cancelled."
And if she isn't lucky?
"Well, then she's dead, and you'll be dealing with Dockery."
"Now, if I were to get the money and put it in the safe, everything will be fine when Audrey opens it up for Dockery tomorrow."
And why would you do that?
Out of the goodness of my heart and $5 million.
There's no fucking way we're giving you $5 million.
I'd reconsider that.
"If you work with me, you're still rich."
"If you go against me, you get nothing."
[sigh] I...
Fine.
Fine.
But the money goes in the safe tonight.
Which brings us to problem number 2.
"If we pay off Dockery, Audrey's got no reason to follow through with the sale of the house."
She sold it to him.
"Seeing as it's Sunday, what you signed was an intent to sell."
Tomorrow she could put a stop to all this and my guess is she will because that's what she does.
Audrey's been pawning collateral.
I have a list of the items she's sold.
Now check out Droopy Dog on the other side.
He's gonna buy her drinks all night and she's still gonna insist there's no spark.
Maybe there's not.
You need a spark.
"Oh, the spark thing is bullshit."
- Really?
- Bullshit.
Enlighten me.
Guys invented the spark so they could not call and treat you kind of badly and keep you guessing then convince you that that anxiety and fear that just develops naturally was actually just a spark.
And you guys all buy it.
You eat it up and you love it.
You love it because you feed off that drama.
You all love that drama.
I don't.
So you never wait until the last minute on a deadline or a phone bill because secretly you love the drama of not knowing whether or not you're gonna make it?
Maybe.
And let me guess:
"When you were stalking Conor the other night were you obsessing about him calling constantly pacing back and forth, staring at your phone for days even though the date was just kind of mediocre?"
[GIGI LAUGHS]
Okay.
Yeah.
Because you all thrive on the drama.
Thank you.
"Look, you gotta be more like me."
"If a girl likes me, great."
"But if not, there are plenty more out there like her, you know?"
With smaller pores and bigger implants.
- That's beautiful.
- I know.
Why are you sharing all of this inside dating information with me again?
"I don't know, I like you."
You do?
This may sound kind of off-center to you... but I want to take my Indian charms and set them under my bunk tonight.
"So when you come in the morning to give me my breakfast, I'd appreciate it... if you didn't look at them."
"I'll probably be asleep... because I'll be up most of the night, thinking."
"Sure, Tom."
Two bourbons.
"What I'm trying to prove, Philip... is that criminals like Tom Horn are not immune to prosecution."
The newspapers and the legal profession... are going to set things straight in this country.
And our system of justice insures that... killers like Tom Horn get exactly what they deserve.
And I'm going to see that it happens.
Where are the rifles in here?
The sheriff said we can't keep them in here no longer.
- You got a gun?
- No.
You going to kill me?
"You and I are walking out of here, and you're going to smile."
Now smile!
Keep smiling.
Smile.
"Listen, I've got a.41 caliber in your back."
You damn fools.
"What are you trying to do, kill him?"
Shit.
You damn fools.
Has the jury arrived at a verdict?
"Yes, we have, Your Honor."
"The jury finds the defendant, Tom Horn, guilty."
The court finds you guilty of murder as charged.
"You are sentenced to be hanged by the neck until dead... between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a. m... on November 20, 1903."
May the Lord have mercy on your soul.
"Someday, you're going to have to pay for your way of life, Tom."
You're a bad man and I know it.
"And if I let you talk me out of it, I'll be lost forever."
- I know.
"You know, when I was growing up I hated everything about the faith."
"Rules, rituals, endless discussions at the dinner table."
I used to sneak into my mom's prayer room.
"You know, holiest of the holies."
"I would dance around naked with porn magazines, just to defy the gods and tell them to frak off."
"I mean, I don't even know how I found this place."
I just got this urge to start  walking.
"And then, suddenly, here it is."
You should see the look on your face when you're in here.
There's this  reverence.
You even talk softer.
I feel something in here.
Something true.
But here I am setting charges in this special place.
Holiest of the holies.
This is...
The temple of five.
If my parents could see this.
And I'm gonna blow it up.
I noticed some anomalies in the solar radiation belt.
I made an analysis of the star's vibrational modes.
"Sure enough, it appears to be highly unstable."
"If you can believe it, on the verge of going supernova."
When ?
It could be tomorrow.
It could be next year.
"There's no way of knowing for sure, Sir."
"When it does happen, the only warning that we're likely to get is a fast helium flash, we'll have to jump out of here before the blow hits the planetary system."
"Sir, I am not one to look for religious signs."
But
I can't get my head around these odds.
We were 15 and 16 during that time.
I didn't know he was going to turn out to be such a great pianist.
"If I hadn't got shot in my finger,"
I would probably still be playing the guitar.
What?
Really?
That's fucking crazy.
How did that happen?
"Well, this guy was pistol-whipping the singer of my band."
This was a problem.
"His mamae was cutting some meat, and she told me if anything happened to him while he was on the road with me,"
"""I'm gonna chop your cajones off."""
I remembered that.
It kind of freaked me out.
"Anyway, when I was hitting the guy, the gun went off."
It was really crazy.
"They sewed it back on, but they didn't, ya know, do the greatest of a job."
But that's life.
You gotta roll with it.
"If you don't roll with it, you're gonna roll under it."
"He was a great musician, anyway."
"If he would have been playing saxophone, he would have been great on that."
"When I was growing up, part of the scene was my living room."
The Neville family was extremely important to our music.
"I mean, they are the first family of funk."
"At times I'd come into the living room at my house, and there he was standing up in the living room talking to my brothers."
All these cats was great.
Sometimes I would be handed the drumsticks.
I always prayed that I could make people feel the same way Ray Charles made me feel.
Those cats would always make a good blend.
We was always playing it together from way back in the game.
It was slamming.
"I was trying to hide it from him, but then..."
He fired me.
"Which is fine, because I wanted to get out of that black hole anyway, but..."
We don't have time to talk about my nine-to-five right now.
You think that that mystery man was after the locket?
I don't think our mystery man is much of a mystery at all.
"Considering Lex went to the Daily Planet tonight, same night that his father died, and fired you over that key."
How long till we get an I.D. On this picture?
Jimmy wasn't kidding when he said there isn't a lot of photo in it.
It's gonna take me at least a couple of hours.
Keep working on it.
"My father just died, and you're already breaking and entering?"
Lionel would never take his own life.
I thought you'd at least try to offer some words of comfort.
Get out.
I'm not going anywhere.
You can still be good.
Tell Clark what you did.
He's our friend.
I'm not gonna debate my father's mental state with you.
I'm grieving.
I think you know what it's like to lose a father.
Don't bring my father into this.
Why not?
Our fathers were a lot alike...
"Smart, strong-willed, and both died prematurely."
"You're right, Lex."
Lionel did die too soon.
I want to know the truth about how he died.
The truth is... our dads were alike in another way.
They both felt that you were the kind of son a father could be proud of.
"He would have felt the same way about you, if you would have tried."
Have you seen your nude pictures in the magazine?
I don't want to see them.
I only want to get that film back.
You're not the only one.
"A lot of girls storm into the office with pimps to get the films back, because they don't want their parents to find out about it."
"Why don't you do that too with your married boyfriend, Nami?"
Oops.
Sorry!
Sorry!
Everyone knows about it.
Be a bit more clever next time.
Did you know the magazine you're has become a best seller and has sold out?
You're kidding me?
I heard that you're never at home.
"That ugly looking editor, Sumi, said he'd wanted to contact you."
It seems he called you a couple of times.
"Hitomi, did you give my number to him?"
"It's not a big deal, is it?"
Where are you meeting them tonight?
The usual place. I don't like it there.
That place is becoming too famous.
The weekly magazine wrote about that place as a Mecca of pornography.
And there're so many perverts hanging around there.
"Hey, do you wanna go then?"
I won't get there on time.
I have to do some shopping first.
"Someone stole underwear from your home, too?"
"Yes, can you believe it?"
About 20 cases are reported to the police every month!
Isn't it scary?
They say this kind of thing aggravates things and leads to sexual crimes like rape.
"Yes, it might even lead to a murder case."
It's mocking us.
"It's a ten-foot-tall springboard that we got for free, and we can't think of a single thing that's good enough to do with it!"
I bet it belonged to some other family that went crazy because they couldn't come up with anything to do with it.
"They probably just sat around, staring at it for months, until they finally snapped and started eating each other."
"Damn it, we're better than this!"
I know we are!
Remember that squashed groundhog we found on the highway?
"We came up with a hundred things to do with that, from the horrible to the beautiful!"
I miss Flatty.
Maybe we're just going about this the wrong way.
We have to think outside the box.
"If you were a diving board, what would you want someone to do with you?"
Take me ice-skating.
Don't be an idiot.
"That place is freezing, and it's always so crowded."
"Yeah, but they have good hot dogs."
Those hot dogs suck compared to the ones at the train station.
Why would a diving board want to go to a train station?
How should I know?
Maybe he wants to visit a relative.
Okay!
Okay!
Back in the box.
Jamie doesn't have to eat his peas anymore.
He can eat whatever he wants because Mommy surrenders.
Mommy has a tiny pony for Jamie who wants to hug him and give him yummy candy corn...
"Mmm, I'm delicious!"
Is there a big boy who could eat me?
"Gotcha, you little..."
"Jamie tries to kill Mom, and we're the ones who have to clean it up."
You want to tell me how that's fair?
You gotta give that kid some credit.
Are you the fire inspector?
"No, I'm a scientist."
"Well, I put my fire extinguisher in and all my exit rows are accesible."
I'm a scientist.
And you're studying windows.
"Well, windows have something to do with my research you see I'm an astrophysicist and I'm researching some phenomenon which has occured in some countries."
I'm from West Berlin.
Let me show you my...identification.
Have you had dinner?
No.
Well I have a free evening tonight.
Why don't we go upstairs and discuss a bite while we eat?
All your costumes... they're just a participation in somekind of a phony theater.
I only tell you this for your own good.
It's a freak show.
Are you trying to say that your blue jeans weren't theater?
It's not the same thing.
So your professor wore a three piece suit and blamed you for your jeans.
And your jeans were too much.
Don't you understand that your suit was also a costume?
Is that your jeans did for love and sexual quality weird is no way wearing a costume.
"So you want me now, right?"
You have the best legs.
We both have good legs.
We had children they would have the best legs to stand.
I thought I looked ugly and would give you diseases.
It's a perfect place for watching.
I'm ordering some chinese is that OK?
It's perfect.
You are wet.
You have no right to do that I'm not your possession.
It's so simple isn't it?
You know that for sure?
"Let's just agree that after extensive investigation of the crash scene it is highly probable and far more acceptable, that rather than driving away in anger... ..she was heading home in remorse."
And earlier today I informed all the concerned parties accordingly.
So unless there are any more questions or problems with the findings...
"No, I think the findings are perfectly acceptable."
"In that case, we need a few snaps with the story."
The flowers would be nice.
"Yeah, that would be nice, Constable Tom."
"Just Tom, please."
I'm off duty now.
Sometimes a lie is kinder than the truth.
"Or if something is not actually true, then it should be."
"So, if a certain story helps people move on with their lives, no longer haunted by the secrets of their past, then I have to say... ..I'm all for it."
"Look at your boy there, George."
"He's got it bad, hasn't it?"
"Yeah, I fear it'll end in tears."
"Yeah, well that's love, isn't it?"
It's like the dolphins.
Or like Bill Jr over there.
(LAUGHS)
Scarred for life.
Were you?
"Nah, that's different, mate, 'cause every time I look at her it's like the dolphins, except it's the version where the orca gets hold of them and rips them apart, fin from fin."
That's not good.
"No, it's not, mate."
It's not ideal.
"So, what are you going to do about it?"
Dunno.
Have another beer.
You?
"No, I'm good, thanks."
"So, how's this for a deal?"
"Well, then the deal may not come off."
I told you about my little problem because we're family.
It has nothing to do with this deal.
I didn't say a word to them about that.
This is just standard stuff.
"When an individual is a commodity, people want insurance."
Fine.
I'll get another lawyer.
What?
I'll go kirk and McGee.
"[Chuckling] Liz, there's other ways to approach this thing."
"You never change, Burton."
What does that mean?
"You lawyer everybody, question everything."
You talk about the rules?
I'm asking you to do a simple deal.
And I'm telling you this is not a simple deal.
Did someone tell them about this?
"Well, I didn't betray you."
"You told them, didn't you?"
"Well, of course, I didn't."
I'm trying to help you.
This is exactly how you were with my sister.
"I'm not gonna have that conversation, you understand?"
This is about business.
"Right now, your deal does not look so good because you can't get life insurance."
Now I suggest you just relax and look at your other options.
Like what?
"Like I go to vortex personally, see if I can get them to back off the insurance demand."
"They'll probably lower the price, and I'm not even sure they'd go for it, but they might."
"But before I do anything, you've got to decide on your lowest number."
Kalaya is an orphan.
OK.
Don't disappoint me.
You don't have to wait till morning.
There's a copy on your doormat.
"TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 15"
We'll put Lund's address under surveillance.
"No, thanks."
"I feel less safe with Special Branch, so, we'll handle it ourselves."
"I know how it looks, but our task then was to make sure the PM wasn't tarnished."
"How do you know, the PM wasn't involved?"
It was his campaign car.
"Chauffeur, staff and all."
"If you think we've put pressure on the public prosecutor, the answer is no."
That would've been a decent guess.
The prosecutor also took us by surprise.
Borch has given you correct information.
"Except you knew about the case and stole that book from under our noses, and you would never have mentioned it yourselves."
Of course we would.
Borch confiscated it so we could form a general idea first.
"- Yeah, right."
- Being offended like a girl won't help.
No one knew that the case involved a black car until we found the crime scene.
Which one of the 12 black cars is it?
The public prosecutor changed the date to cover for one of them.
- Which one?
"- If we knew that, we would have said."
- Is Ussing's car among them?
- Yes.
Also a campaign car.
We're looking into the claim that he knew Louise Hjelby.
It may have come from a questionable witness.
- Then we'll have to question Ussing.
"Oh, it was a couple of hours after you left the house that night."
She said there was something very urgent that we should discuss privately.
"And since it takes only a few minutes to get out to her house, I--"
Did she tell you that she'd also received threatening phone calls?
I didn't believe her then and I still don't.
All right.
"But it wasn't just the blackmailing thing she wanted to talk about, was it?"
No.
She said Sandy was going to be in trouble over some money.
"She didn't know what Frank Sellers was going to do about it, but it might be serious trouble."
And only she could get Sandy out of it if he'd quit his job and we'd both move out of town.
"In other words, practically admit that we-- or I had been up to something."
What more proof did I need that she was the one?
And you told her so.
And that's when Lita brought out her gun?
"No, she lost her temper."
She tried to threaten me with some silly little thing she kept in her bureau.
That silly little thing was the gun that killed her.
"And Beth, your fingerprints are all over it."
"Oh, Perry, I grew up with too many brothers."
I told Lita she ought to be spanked or worse.
"I simply took the gun away from her, threw it down on the desk and walked out."
"Well, I wish you'd told me all that the next day."
How could I?
I drove home that night.
The lights were on.
So I went for a walk.
I stopped at Dorothea's and we talked a while.
And at 1:00 I went home.
I thought Sandy was asleep.
Then I heard the car come in.
What else could I think the next morning but that he'd taken the car out after I had;
to play with them.
To go to the toilet with?
"No, no, no, no, I'm coming to the toilet bit."
"So, I was talking to one of the fellows in the orchestra, a violinist, and he said that Van arrived about ten minutes before the gig, gave them a list of 100 songs - they'd been there since"
"midday - he gave them a list of 100 songs and said,"
"""I'll be playing four of them""."
"And so later on, backstage, I was dying to go to the toilet, so I went into a toilet."
"The next thing, there's this knock on the door, going, ""Who's in my fucking toilet?"
"Who's in my toilet?"""
And it's Van and I'm delighted cos now I have a little Van moment to treasure forever.
"And I came out and he kind of recognised me or something - which was very flattering - but he started giving me a headbutt, was his was of greeting but it was a friendly headbutt,"
I don't know if that happens in Wales or...
"It's kind of like, arrrggghh."
"Oh, yeah, yeah, that one, yeah."
"I thought you meant, bang!"
I love you!
"No, no, no, it was very friendly."
Wow!
Yeah.
"As you were coming out of the lavatory, he did that?"
"Well, I hid in there for as long as possible but he wasn't going anywhere."
He stayed there.
I thought he wanted to go to the toilet.
He wanted to go and...
"Why didn't you come out straight away, what were you doing?"
"Well, I was a bit afraid."
I kind of thought he might go somewhere else.
We were talking about heckling earlier.
"I want to know what it's like to be heckled by Grandmaster Flash, the hip-hop legend."
Well...
Yeah.
Did he heckle you in a rhyme?
And he came after you?
Yeah.
He's got a fatwa against me.
"W-w-when -- when he's not selling machine guns to toddlers in Sierra Leone, he's out looking for his ex-wife, so I went into hiding."
"Welcome to ""hiding."""
"Well, why don't you run your business from here?"
"Oh, so, suddenly you're an expert on how to run my business, Sinéad o'Handsome?"
He paid off some of my workers.
"Every time I try to move something, they show up with guns."
And if he were removed from the picture?
"If you guys get rid of Jabbar Hamady,"
"I'll give you guys new identities, passports, a free trip to wherever you want to go."
Okay.
Just give us what you got on the guy.
"One more thing, though -- when we get the new names, mine is Chuck Finley."
Okay?
That's non-negotiable.
"You got it, Chuck."
Taking a break?
"Yes, as a matter of fact."
"I figure if we're really gonna be on the run, this might be the last chance I have to get drunk in a jacuzzi, so..."
I'm living it up while I can.
What do you think?
"Well, in addition to wife-beating, the guy's hobbies seem to be torture and war crimes."
"Which means if we can find Jabbar, we can let the authorities take care of it."
"Well, don't forget that we're on the run, too, so, you know, not like we're gonna run around Miami asking people if they've seen a pissed-off Syrian."
"Schmidt said he had one remaining warehouse, right?"
Mm-hmm.
What are you thinking?
"If we could get Jabbar to send his men there,"
I might be able to get to him.
"Yeah, or you could just get shot."
Uh-huh.
"See, I knew you wouldn't understand."
"Hey, no, no, no, listen."
This is something I understand real well.
"I mean, it's very easy to find some place that's comfortable and just stay there."
"Now, what's wrong with being comfortable?"
"I mean, I think I could do pretty well settling in a place like this."
"But that's it, Eric!"
"That's all you'd be doing, just settling."
"And over the years, you'd try and convince yourself that that's the life you really wanted, but you don't."
"I mean, you just stumbled into it, and you'll never love it."
"And one day, you'll realize that all you've done is settle, and you will not like yourself for that."
"I don't like myself now, Dad."
What am I even going home to?
To the support of your family and friends who'll help you find what you really want.
I'm afraid to go home.
"Eric, you never have to be afraid to go home."
How are you so sure?
Because he's Dad.
Yeah.
That's mostly what I am.
Let's go.
They're up and on their way down.
I told them you made blueberry pancakes.
I didn't make blueberry pancakes.
"Oh, they're lucky we let them live here."
"Topanga, are you and Cory going to kiss?"
"Morgan, I think that's very personal and we shouldn't talk about it."
"Come on, just between us girls."
Right on the lips.
"Topanga, he's not going to have time for you."
"The man has been gone for two months and we have so much catching up to do, he's not even going to know you exist."
"- You need Henry, not me, right?"
- That's right.
"Frankly, I don't care whether you go or not."
"If it'll make him a better witness, I'd like you to be with him."
"They want Henry, not me."
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.
They can only get to him by getting to you getting to your kids.
"If he goes into the program, you're in danger..."
- I don't know anything.
"- Don't give me... the babe-in-the-woods routine, Karen."
"I've listened to those wiretaps, and I've heard you talk about cocaine."
Conversation after conversation you talked to Henry on the phone.
It doesn't matter.
"Whether he goes to jail or stays on the streets and beats the case, he's a dead man."
He knows it and you know it.
What about the kids and school?
Will they get left back?
"I mean, what goes on?"
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.
Whoever sold you those suits had a sense of humor.
What it comes down to is we're your only salvation.
"We'll gonna save your life, we'll gonna save his life and we'll keep you out of jail."
This morning you told the jury about your background.
It was easy for us to disappear.
My house was in my other-in-law's name.
My cars were registered to my wife.
My Social Security cards and driver's licenses were phonies.
"I never voted, I never paid taxes."
My birth certificate and arrest sheet was all you'd ever have to know I was alive.
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.
I hope they're good bonds.
"Many a man's cut his throat on gilt-edged securities you know, luke."
"But these are government bonds, boss."
As good as the mint.
"No, they ain't, boss."
What?
"I've known you all my life, jim, and you've never once lied to me."
"No, luke, but what are you getting at?"
Did you know all the time that the north was going to win the war?
Of course i did.
Everybody did.
"Well, why'd you keep writing me that the confederates was gonna?"
"Certainly-we knew their secret service was opening our letters, so we always had to tell you the south was going to win."
"Well, it got me all kerflummoxed."
"If i hadn't have believed in you, jim, we'd have had more than $2 million, but... oh, i put it all in confederate bonds."
There they are.
Confederate bonds?
They're not worth a nickel.
They're blowing like dead leaves down the streets of richmond.
"For 3 and 1/2 years we lived on boiled leather and grits, risked our necks dodging tar, feathers, and bullets... always one jump ahead of a firing squad."
We even had to learn another language.
And now we get paid off in confederate bonds.
$2 million worth of nothing.
"Well... hey-hey, where are you going?"
What's the matter with you?
"Aw, the way i ruined you both and all."
"That was my fault, wasn't it?"
I shouldn't have lied to you.
"Come on back here and sit down, come on."
"Say, what are you up to?"
"I've got a chill, i thought i'd liven up the fire."
"Wait a minute- these cost us $821,000."
- You should be in command.
"- I'm passing command to you, Hask."
Take over the column till I get back.
"Hunda, why don't you think again?"
- Do you have to go?
- Yes.
If I'd have gone last time Igin would still be alive.
- And you might be dead.
"- Look, we're losing this war, but if we can destroy the Magnetrix terminal, we may still have a chance, and it's our only chance."
- There are plenty of others.
I'm willing to try.
- You're not a geologist.
We need to know the exact point where we can start the shaft.
"How long it's going to take, what sort of equipment will be required."
And a dozen other questions that only an expert can decide.
How are you going to get into the city?
We haven't found an entrance yet that isn't covered.
That's true.
They probably got Igin on their detector screens before he got 50 yards.
I'm going to swim in under the reactors.
- I doubt if they thought of that.
"- I doubt it, too."
"That's an impossible swim, Hunda."
Fifty metres underwater in almost total blackness.
- You'll never make it.
- I think I can.
"There are two places along that cooling system where it's possible to surface, and as long as I keep my face to the current, I should be heading in the right direction."
"All right, Hask, you take over now."
Get the column moving.
"And if all goes well, I'll be back tomorrow night."
"Good luck, Hunda."
"This is the high chamber, Excellency."
Let me see what this bitch can really do.
All right.
"Here, suit up."
"Listen, whatever you do, keep this mask on, you hear me?"
"Because if you get in trouble, then I get in big time trouble."
- I'm not gonna get you in trouble.
"- No, that's right."
"You're not going to get me in trouble because if you get in trouble, then I'm going to get in big time trouble."
"And if I get in big time trouble, then you-- what are we talking about?"
Let's go.
It stinks in here.
"You'll get used to it.In fact, there will be times you find yourself craving that stink, like it's a drug or something."
Watch your head.
"Usually a fire like this, it's either a torch job or it was initiated by something stupid, you know, something small like a cigarette or a candle."
"This burn, classic case of jewish lighting."
- What's that?
- Arson.
"Torch must have gassed the shit out of the stairwell, because by the time we got here, all the floors were fully involved and the flame was coming out through the bulkhead on the roof."
- Where you going?
- Upper floors.
- I don't know.
"- What, you scared?"
- Kinda.
- Good.Let's go.
"So the engine will come in and do the final douche once we open up the cockloft and check for any hidden flame, then we could take up, head home, and get some r and R."
Can we get a long island iced tea after the shift?
"Hey, don't push your luck, buddy."
"Hey, tommy, want to join me up here?"
Shit.
Come on.
"Here, get in here, and I'll come back for you, all right."
- Let me go talk to these guys.
It's okay.
Let's clear the karma.
Okay?
I'll holster this.
"See, you know, I work 10 hours a day, so by the time I come home, I'm exhausted."
It's not that I don't want to answer questions about the house renovation.
I really just don't want to answer questions about anything.
"But, you know, you may just be shutting your mind off, but it can feel like you're shutting your partner off as well."
"Again, that's a caution area."
"And just as a point of interest, when you speak that way, David, you're really de-prioritizing your teammate."
Excuse me?
"It's called ""crossing emotional boundaries."""
"Or, more commonly, ""bulldozing."" And it's ugly."
"Ronnie, when you spoke earlier of..."
Let me just find it in my notes here.
"There it is+ You said, ""We make it through things well together."""
That doesn't sound very fun.
"You don't want to look back and say, ""I made it through my life."""
"We want to enjoy our projects, enjoy our work week."
"We want to enjoy our lives, celebrate our lives."
"And all this talk about my project and his work, and my this and his that, and mine and his, and mine and..."
"It,s..."
Where's us in all that?
Where is our journey?
I don't hear it.
And it's because it's not there.
Listen.
"I'm not saying that there's not some really stressful times sometimes, because there is, but it works for us."
Does it?
I don't know.
"Oh, gosh, I don't know, you guys."
"There's no ""us."" There's no ""we."""
"Agatheus, Agamemnon, Apostolos and Algerius, right?"
"We'd go round the house and celebrate it there, but I haven' heard from them since September, so I don't know what's happening this year."
I think they'll call me.
"I have been round to their house and it's all boarded up, so I don't know what's going on."
But they'll ring me in due course to let me know the festivity arrangements.
I look forward to it as well.
Did...
Hold on a second.
A question from Sarah.
You can come to mine if you want.
Hmm?
Come to mine if you want.
This is exactly what I'm talking about!
Will you leave it alone?
I'm only being polite.
We had that one night in the Holiday Inn.
Yes.
And we both agreed you was rubbish.
"You didn't know what you were doing, fumbling around, so from now on, it's just a ""no""!"
"You've got to be brutal because she'll only, backstage, flash me her bits and I don't want to see it."
It's Christmas.
Everybody's in the party spirit.
Are you a party man yourself?
"Yeah, big time, big time, because people want me to come to their parties all the time."
"They look at me and they go, ""Yeah, I like the look of him."""
"Oh, yes, yes."
But what's going on upstairs?
That's what they want to know and there's a lot going on up there.
I like to talk about things like music and other stuff and politics and all that sort of stuff.
"You'd be in the kitchen in the party, not cutting a rug like Rhys?"
"No, I'd just be in the kitchen having a chat and all that sort of carry-on and holding court."
That's what I'd be doing.
"Wake me if the Lieutenant shows up, will you?"
You girls aren't supposed to come down here anymore.
Do you want me to leave?
I didn't say that.
Then I won't.
"If my Lieutenant saw you here, I'd be in trouble."
Nobody will see us back here.
Is dark... private.
I like this strategy.
Ready to go?
No...you're not coming with me.
Of course I am.
We settled this.
"You told that man, Darod, how I saved you from the Mokra!"
You did save me.
Now I'm returning the favor.
I promise I'll try to find your wife.
Wait!
Ralkana!
No!
I've been studying their orbital sensor net.
It surrounds the entire planet.
This is the most sophisticated system I've ever seen.
"It monitors everything we do, there's no way of disabling it from orbit."
So much for a surprise attack.
We may still be able to surprise them even if they do see us coming.
We could modify the main deflector to send out dozens of radion beams which should penetrate the prison shields.
"One of them will carry our transporter signal, but the sensor net won't be able to distinguish which one, so the Mokra won't know the exact location we're beaming to."
And they won't know where to concentrate their defenses.
Thas the best head start I can give you.
Then ill have to do.
How long will it take to modify the deflector?
What have you got?
Fresh tracks.
It's him.
Now do you believe?
I still think there's more to this than she and Zaddik are telling us.
He's heading upstream into the hills.
Let me ask you something.
"If you can prove to everyone that I'm telling the truth, that Ellia no longer needs to feed."
Do you think the villagers would accept her?
That's what I'm afraid of.
"No matter how hard we try to convince them, they'll always see her as a monster."
"I'm getting old, Doctor."
You've got lot's of time.
Never have as much as we think we have.
"And when I'm gone, she'll be alone."
"I try to teach her about love and human companionship, but that's exactly what she'll never have."
"Zaddik, there's something I want to show you."
"I didn't say anything at first, because I didn't want to get your hopes up."
It's a retrovirus.
Something I've been working on.
I don't understand.
"Oh God, how am I gonna explain this?"
Part of Ellia is human.
And part of her comes from a creature we call the Erratus bug.
It's the part that makes her look the way she does and where her desire to feed comes from.
"Now it's possible, by means of this retrovirus, we can strip away those parts and leave only the human parts behind."
You mean she'd be like you and me?
Yes.
Now I must warn you.
The retrovirus is still experimental.
In fact it's only been tested on cell cultures in a laboratory and so far without much success.
"I'm hoping, that what we can learn from your daughter will help me perfect it."
I trusted Soon-shin's words and I put you through this awful ordeal.
How will I ever make it up to you?
One never knows what evil lurks in the heart of men...
I just want you to focus on getting well.
I didn't know that you're all alone in this world with not one family member to care for you.
Consider me as family from now on.
You can think of me as your father or an uncle if that's more comfortable.
Sir...!
I will take care of you like a son from now.
Do you know what I mean?
"But regardless of the circumstance that led to this, I did save your life by getting you out."
And even animate don't hesitate to jump into a fire to pay back a debt of gratitude if you save them from death.
How about it?
Will you obey my orders from now on?
"Yes, sir."
"I will follow your orders, sir."
You will?
Yes.
Hide this somewhere in the laborer's quarters and go to the authorities.
I am telling you to turn him in.
And I will keep you near and place you in important service.
Thank you for the other night.
I'm glad.
I'm really glad that you are okay.
"I could not be happier about your friend, but I am ill at ease."
They are not to be taken lightly.
The baron will not stand down after the humiliation he suffered.
Master...
Go to Gon-yang with this letter and find Master Nam-goong.
He is a man of great heart.
He will teach you valuable lessons.
Master...
Surely your wife knows someone you can sleep with.
Not a lot of people ever laugh at that part.
She certainly wishes I would stop saying it.
But now we got these cameras.
Can't go back now.
It's out there.
I think what life is actually about...
Now actually...
And action.
Now the special is starting.
Action.
I think what life is actually about... is realizing that we're all covered in layers that we've put there for some reason.
For protection.
Whatever reason it is.
The only way you're gonna get to know who you truly are and expose your true self to everyone else is to get rid of those layers.
And you see some people get rid of those layers at a young age.
You see they have a very happy life.
Then you see some people that are your age who haven't removed one layer.
"You're like, ""Ooh."""
That's the layer that I removed that day.
I found out... that I'm a guy who will just fuck whatever you got.
"What have you got over there, a pile of inanimate objects?"
Cool if I put my dick in 'em?
I'm one of those people.
"I'd fuck a fake ass, if you had one."
Don't act like you don't know what that is.
Nobody can clear their pop-ups that fast.
"Not saying you have one, but you know what's on the market."
"No legs, no torso."
It's just an ass that you have sex with.
"Yes, the show is surprisingly bookended."
I hope that's the point that the guy was taking an hour-long shit comes back in.
"Yakety, yakety yak."
Mad as a wet hen she was.
"Poor Mr. Nash, you could see he was suffering... but didn't have a chance with Big Mouth."
And what was she blowing her top about this time?
"Well, I'll tell you."
Because she didn't want to go to the boss's house for dinner.
Just because Mr. Nash asked her to change her dress.
"You should've seen her, decked out like a showgirl or something."
But she refused to get into something respectable.
She'd rather go out someplace fancy the way she was... than keep her husband on good terms with his boss.
[inaudible]
I won't even repeat some of the things she had to say.
"And that poor man, what he must have been going through."
She even had the nerve to make him call his boss... to say they couldn't come.
And do you know what she was doing while he was calling?
She just laughed.
"Well, she could afford to."
She won.
I couldn't keep my mouth shut any longer and I let her have it.
I simply told her that she didn't deserve a man like Mr. Nash.
"And she had the nerve to get sore about it, even though I was right."
It might've ended up in a real hair-pulling contest... if it hadn't been for Mr. Nash.
But....
Such a gentleman.
He just couldn't stand by and let her abuse me.
He had to tear us apart practically.
But I guess he didn't really mind.
"I guess he was flattered that I stuck up for him... because, right then and there, he asked me... how such a wonderful, understanding woman like me... had stayed a widow so long."
"Blanche, he was divine."
(Blanche) So what?
"So what, what?"
So you don't think he meant anything personal?
"As you know, Mom's been going to business school... at the community college for three years now."
I believe she's mentioned it.
She's doing very well and she's finishing up.
"Actually, she's graduating Thursday, and there's going to be a ceremony."
I think it would mean a lot to her if you guys were there.
"It may not seem like it would, but it's true."
"If it would mean so much to her, why didn't she invite us herself?"
'Cause she didn't think you'd want to go.
"And I get that, but I think it's a mistake."
I had a school thing once.
"I wasn't sure if Mom would want to go, so I didn't invite her."
It was my kindergarten Salute To Vegetables pageant... and I was Broccoli and I did a tap dance with Beets.
"And the entire number, I was just thinking, 'Mom's not here. '"
And it was my fault that she wasn't there.
"Well, it was kind of a life lesson for me."
"Now, if the thought of going to Mom's graduation... upsets you, or makes you unhappy, or uncomfortable in any way... then please don't go."
"Because this is an important night for Mom... and if you go, you should go under the right circumstances."
Those are the tickets.
"It's Thursday, 7:00 p. m."
"It's indoors, so weather's not an issue."
You can use them or not.
No hard feelings.
Do what you feel is best.
"And, if you don't mind, I would really appreciate it... if you would keep this conversation between the three of us."
That's all I have to say.
Thanks very much for your patience.
I believe I have time for a scone before my bus leaves.
"Beatrice, the tea, please."
"Emily, these look delicious."
"So, Richard, how was your day today?"
"I am feeling so good, sister, because it's over."
"No more finals, no more studying, no more school."
Wait a minute.
Nobody can do that.
Nobody's ever had my idea.
How much gold do you think is in actual circulation in this country?
Only 20 millions.
What would happen if we buy and buy and buy till we cornered it?
We could raise the price of gold 3 times what it is now- pay for what we bought out of the profits and come out holding more gold than anybody ever had in their hands since the days of king midas.
"But you can't corner gold, jim."
The government would stop you.
How?
They'd release gold from washington.
They'd swamp you.
I'll take care of washington.
"Now, look, jim, put a bridle on that wild imagination."
"You try to put a false price on gold, and you'll pull down the financial structure of this whole country!"
"There'll be a panic you can't stop, nor anybody else!"
Where's your nerve?
!
"Jim, i won't let you do it."
"Nobody is going to say things to you, josie, like they did tonight."
"Nick don't feel about you the way i do or he wouldn't be talking like he is, trying to throw cold water over the greatest idea i ever had!"
The most dangerous idea.
Don't you worry about me.
I never failed yet at anything.
I'm not going to fail now.
I told you a long time ago i had the golden touch.
Now i'm going to prove it!
"Well, if you try, jim, i can't go with you."
"For the first time in my life, i can't go with you."
You mean you'd split partners?
I'd have to.
Aren't you getting kind of moral all of a sudden?
So what are you going to do?
"Well, we still have a case to work."
That might be a little difficult since our client isn't talking to us anymore.
It doesn't mean we drop the case.
"Listen, two men are still dead."
The police aren't treating this as a homicide.
You still think it has something to do with that drug.
"Well, unless there's some kind of insect infestation that we don't know about, the drug is the only thing those two deaths have in common."
We need to get a pure sample of that drug so we can find out what the hell it is.
You're going to have to go in.
Me?
You don't think I'll mess up your investigation?
"Coreen, I trust you."
Clearly you're the one suited to this.
I don't know that world.
To be honest I wasn't really serious about it to begin with.
Is this your way of apologizing or are you just trying to avoid having your hair dyed black?
Is it okay if it's a little of both?
"All right, listen."
There is one condition.
You're going to have to wear this transmitter.
I'll be able to hear you at all times.
- Okay.
"- All right, you have one hour."
"If you don't make contact during that time,"
I want you to get out.
"If you look nervous, you're going to draw heat, so be careful."
If you do get into trouble
"I want you to say, ""my mother is not going to like this,"""
and I will come right in.
I know what I'm doing.
"All right, don't accept any drinks from anyone, and don't leave your drink unattended."
"And if I get high with one of my main life stressors,"
I don't think I'm gonna have a good time.
"And when I went to visit her, I had a rental car, and I let my mom drive it."
"And the steering wheel was thinner than the steering wheel in her car that she drives every day, so she made note of it and was like,"
"""This steering wheel is too thin."
"I like a big, thick steering wheel."""
"And I was like, ""Okay."""
"And she goes, ""Yeah, you know why?"
"'Cause it reminds me of gripping a big dick."""
"And I was like, ""No!"""
"And then she kept going... and was like, ""Yeah, bet you didn't think"
"I had a preference."""
"And I was like,"
"""Why would I ever think about that?"
"No, it hasn't crossed my mind."""
But looking back at how many grips and covers and cushions my mom used to put on her steering wheel when I was younger... safe to say that Mommy likes it big.
"Which is good for me to know, because it shows me that we have more in common that I thought."
"I like getting to know my mom as an adult, because there were so many holes of knowledge when I was younger."
There were just so many things I didn't know.
"Like, I knew certain things, but didn't know the backstory of those things."
I knew that she doesn't like white people.
And I could take some guesses as to why.
But it was never explained.
"One day, we were in her car, and she stopped to let this old white couple pass in front of us, and she lets out this deep sigh like, ""Ugh..."
"White people."""
"And I was like, ""Uh...what's wrong?"
"They're not even talking to us right now."""
"And she goes, ""Memories."""
And that's where the conversation ended.
And she would do that a lot.
"She'd just chalk things up to memories, and I would never follow up and ask what those memories were."
"And I was so young and just, like, left to my own devices."
"1002 01:23:23,989 --&amp;gt; 01:23:26,826 I don't have to give you any explanation , 1003 01:23:26,900 --&amp;gt; 01:23:29,900 but just for you not doing any injustice to Mira, I am saying it again... 1004 01:23:30,038 --&amp;gt; 01:23:34,956 really there is nothing like you think,..."
"1005 01:23:47,500 --&amp;gt; 01:23:49,500 God, I got it again!"
"1006 01:23:49,513 --&amp;gt; 01:23:52,635 Congratulations!"
- Thanks!

"1010 01:24:08,400 --&amp;gt; 01:24:12,400 What kind of feeling is to walk around between your creations?"
"1011 01:24:16,900 --&amp;gt; 01:24:18,800 With your permission!"
"1012 01:24:24,313 --&amp;gt; 01:24:27,430 Now the time is ripe for introducing ourselves."
"1013 01:24:27,756 --&amp;gt; 01:24:30,033 I'm Asim Sekip Kaya."
"1014 01:24:30,860 --&amp;gt; 01:24:33,416 Hello."
"1015 01:24:38,869 --&amp;gt; 01:24:41,150 It means finally you met."
"1016 01:24:41,316 --&amp;gt; 01:24:44,581 Yes, finally I met with the protagonist of the incident 1017 01:24:44,700 --&amp;gt; 01:24:49,300 In the tiredness of the big storm he caused 1018 01:24:49,392 --&amp;gt; 01:24:52,316 he joined us in activities ."
"1019 01:24:52,800 --&amp;gt; 01:24:57,700 The storm happened because of your prejudgments."
"1020 01:24:57,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:00,100 Anyway the water stopped now."
"1021 01:25:00,200 --&amp;gt; 01:25:04,700 Let's hope that a reverse wind won't blow lateen!"
"1022 01:25:04,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:11,200 Let's during the time in what side blows the wind."
"1023 01:25:15,599 --&amp;gt; 01:25:18,264 Enjoy..- Where is Mert?"
"1024 01:25:18,428 --&amp;gt; 01:25:20,760 He as around , but..."
"1025 01:25:22,103 --&amp;gt; 01:25:24,830 Ahh, hello.."
"1026 01:25:37,900 --&amp;gt; 01:25:41,700 How can I be so unlucky?"
"1027 01:25:54,054 --&amp;gt; 01:25:56,135 How're you doing?"
"1028 01:25:57,800 --&amp;gt; 01:26:00,400 Pretty well.."
"1029 01:26:18,951 --&amp;gt; 01:26:21,839 This is my last night here ."
"1030 01:26:23,059 --&amp;gt; 01:26:25,419 Really?"
"1031 01:26:26,400 --&amp;gt; 01:26:30,200 It means that after tonight everyone will be back to their world ."

"(Male announcer) This is the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen, where, for one home cook, dreams will become a reality."
[Cheers]
"After searching across the entire country for America's finest home chefs, we've narrowed it down to 18."
I'm a food photographer.
I'm a graduate student.
I'm a stockbroker.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime for me.
"(Announcer) But to earn the title of Masterchef, they must impress three of the biggest names in the culinary world..."
Joe Bastianich...
"The hallmarks of a Masterchef are elegance, sophistication, and finesse."
- (Announcer) Graham Elliot...
"- To me, a Masterchef is constantly innovating."
(Announcer) And Gordon Ramsay.
A true Masterchef puts perfection on every plate.
"(Announcer) Tonight, the competition officially begins."
We're looking for one stunning dish.
(Announcer) And with that comes twists...
What the heck is gonna happen now?
(Announcer) Turns...
Fire.
Fire.
(Announcer) And tears.
The search for America's next Masterchef begins now.
"Thousands of cooks have already been eliminated, and only 18 remain in the search for America's next Masterchef."
Now it's time for these top home cooks to take their place in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen.
(Michael) Walking into the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef &amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen for the first time is incredible.
"It's such a beautiful kitchen, you know."
It's the kitchen that I've always dreamed of.
(Josh) The &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; kitchen even has its own bar and restaurant.
"Man, this is crazy."
It's freakin' awesome.
I have never seen so many glorious bottles of wine.
"Tom Hanks, Haley Joel Osment, and Robin Williams."
I'm going to connect together actors who were in movies together with lines that represents those movies.
"So Bruce Willis and Tom Hanks were in a movie together called,"
"""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" that seemed like it was going to be very good but it was not."
"Bruce Willis and Cloris Leachman were in a movie together called ""Beavis and Butt-Head Do America""--it was not a very popular movie."
"Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""The Terminal."""
"Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis were in ""The Sixth Sense."" They were the stars of that movie."
"I will not tell you the ending, but Haley Joel Osment was also in ""Forrest Gump"" with Tom Hanks."
"Robin Williams and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Deconstructing Harry."""
"Cloris Leachman and Stanley Tucci were in a movie called ""Gambit""."
"Danny Devito and Robin Williams were in ""Death to Smoochy."" All right!"
"Next I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Danny Devito, who were in a movie together called ""I'm Still Here."""
"And lastly, I'm going to connect Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci, who were in a movie called ""Billy Bathgate."""
All right!
"Now that we have the diagram, I'm going to start off with one of the actors."
Let's say Bruce Willis and I'm going to move around on this structure visiting all the movies exactly once and so let's see how that goes.
So there's lot of different choices to start off.
"Let's say, I'm going to go from Bruce Willis to Tom Hanks, Tom Hanks to Stanley Tucci,"
"Stanley Tucci back to Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis to Cloris Leachman to Stanley Tucci again, to Robin Williams to Danny Devito to Bruce Willis to Haley Joel Osment, and then to Tom Hanks, and now you can see that I've visited all of the movies exactly once and I ended up at Tom Hanks."
All right!
So let's try this again with a different set of actors.
"Now we've got Susan Sarandon, Dustin Hoffman, Julia Roberts,"
"Kevin Bacon, Robert De Niro, Anne Hathaway, and Meryl Streep."
And then we're going to put in some of the movies again.
"Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman who were in a movie together called ""Wag the Dog."""
"Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep were in a movie together called ""Marvin's Room."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Susan Sarandon were in a movie together called ""Moonlight Mile."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Hook."""
"Dustin Hoffman and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""Sleepers."""
"Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts were in a movie together called ""Stepmom."""
"Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts were in ""Flatliners."""
Nobody can tell from some of the movies and the actors that I've picked that I watched more movies in the 80s than I watch now.
"Frank, let's go, please."
"Everybody's looking at me to make the quintessential Italian dish, so, yeah, I'm feeling the pressure."
I'm feeling that I need to bring it.
What have you got for us?
"Clam, artichoke, and blood orange."
"Pancetta, basil, toasted fennel seeds, and guajillo pepper."
I knew you guys were gonna be looking at me
"'cause I'm Italian, so I wanted to do something different and hopefully impress you."
"Well, it worked. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Bravo."
Good job.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Thank you so much.
Look at the texture in that.
"That's what I loven risotto, you know, being able &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;to stir&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;and find all the little goodies&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- hiddenn there.
- Yes.
"Um, Frank, you ain't playing around, dude."
"That's pretty good. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Thanks, guys.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; - Frankie!"
[Applause]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Frank, the light bulb's on.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Right?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"- That's it, baby. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;- Here we go.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
"All right, David, please."
"I need to start making a name for myself in this kitchen, or else I'm gonna go by the wayside, and I can't have that happen."
"In the veal stock risotto, I put portobellos and some oyster mushrooms, gooseberry-roasted poblano, and some scallops. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Making risotto and&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; using veal stock at the same time is a very dangerous game."
You nailed it.
Thank you.
Really good job.
This is one of the best things that I've tasted in a long time.
- Oh.
"Oh, my gosh."
- It's delicious.
"The poblano, the cook on the rice is perfect. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The layering of flavors.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
- Well done.
"- Oh, my God."
Helene.
Wow.
"Um, what is that?"
"That is saffron risotto, topped with scallops that are crusted in a red peppercorn-smoked sea salt wrapped in burdock root."
"So, visually, when you can still see the center &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;of that bright grain of rice,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; what does that mean?"
That it's perhaps undercooked?
"""Perhaps."""
That's not perhaps.
It's definitely undercooked.
The basket...
What the [Bleep] is that? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;A basket.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
[Bleep].
Uhh!
"God, I could scream."
The scallops are still raw.
"I'm looking at that, and I'm looking at the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; trophy, I'm thinking, ""nah."""
"All right, guys."
You guys understand the spirit of this competition? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What we're looking for here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Scallop basket...
Go in the garbage basket.
[Scoffs]
"&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We're not fooling around here.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;We're looking&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;for specific things,&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; it's not a game, and you're not here to waste our time."
- You understand?
- Yes.
"The rice is undercooked, and the scallops are a joke."
You guys understand the spirit of this competition? &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;What we're looking for here?&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
Scallop basket...
Go in the garbage basket.
[Scoffs]
"The rice is undercooked, and the scallops are a joke."
"They really seemed offended by these creations that I made, but at least I went to the edge of my comfort zone."
I tried something new.
Here is another example
For example they want to insult you and calling you gay
Most probably you will be called gay in a rude manner
"Now then, You know you're not gay"
So it's not true
"Second, if in your value system there is nothing wrong with being Gay"
So there is no insult
"If however gay, is evil for you"
So you see only the first point.
You're not gay....
So who ever is insulting is lying
Now take the stormtrooper Come over here
"Yes, my dear"
"As you accidentally have learned from the episode ""vulgarization of the senses"""
Stormtrooper is gay
And now try to insult him
"Hey glasseyes, you Gay!"
Hope I've insulted
Want to hurt me?
Call me Natural
From this we reach the conclusion
The offender in this case is quite homophobic
"And he will not name the Stormtrooper,Natural"
Because in his value system it is normal
"When insulting,the offender just telling us from what he afraid of..."
Whomever he would not want to be
And He simply LYlNG.LYlNG and LYlNG
Only projecting his complex on us
"Ideally,in order not to disclose information about yourself"
Should insult so
"Hi Kostya,All II want is for yout to feel bad."
LOL I'm so evil ...
I was just upstairs talking with Win Phippen and he told me I could find you down here.
I am over here talking to him about his new USDA grant so I thought I would just ask you a couple of questions if you have a couple of minutes.
William Bailey:
Certainly do.
And welcome to our Ag Mech Lab.
Beth Seaton:
"Yeah, I've never been in here before."
It smells like an Ag Mech Lab.
Tell me a little bit about what a grant like Win Phippen's means for your department.
"It's a wonderful opportunity for Win, for the"
"School of Agriculture, and for our students."
It means a lot because it puts us on the cutting-edge on a lot of the research that is going on in plant breeding.
"And, more importantly, it gives students an opportunity to work with Win, who will teach them plant- breeding techniques, and they will apply what they learn in class under his supervision."
Beth Seaton:
"He seems really exicted about his program, and when I'm talking to him about it"
[Text on screen:
"Beth Seaton, Director, WlU Office of Sponsored Projects] you can just see the enthusiasm come out."
I've talked with a lot of other ag faculty from your department in my role as the director of sponsored projects.
"You have a lot of faculty member who are involved in not only in teaching in the classroom, but also heavily involved in research projects."
William Bailey:
We certainly do.
And it is that blend of
[Text on screen:
"Dr. William Baily, Director, WlU School of Agriculture] research and teaching, which, I think, is real hallmark of the School of Agriculture here at Western. because the faculty members are doing their scientific research, bringing it into the classroom themselves."
They are the teachers and they are the researchers.
"For example, here in the Ag Mech Lab, the students put on the Ag Mech Show, under the guidance of our ag mech instructor."
Beth Seaton:
And that is every February?
William Bailey:
Every February.
But it's student run.
It's the
What's your business here?
Does your son know he's ill?
Does he know what's wrong with him?
How..
And so the the story begins
"City dweller, successful fella"
Thought to himself oops I've got a lot of money
I'm caught in a rat race terminally
I'm a professional cynic but my heart's not in it
I'm paying the price of living life at the limit
Caught up in the centuries anxiety
"Yes, it preys on him, he's getting thin"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats and the food he eats in the country
He takes all manner of pills and piles up analyst bills in the country
"Oh, it's like an animal farm lot's of rural charm in the country"
"He's got morning glory, life's a different story"
"Everything's going jackanory, in touch with his own mortality"
"He's reading balzac, knocking back prozac"
It's a helping hand that makes you feel wonderfully bland
"Oh, it's the centuries remedy"
"For the faint at heart, a new start"
"He lives in a house, a very big house in the country"
He's got a fog in his chest so he needs a lot of rest in the country
"He doesn't drink smoke laugh, takes herbal baths in the country"
Says she's come to no harm on an animal farm in the country
"In the country, in the country"
In the country
"Blow, blow me out  I am so sad, I don't know why"
"Blow, blow me out  I am so sad, I don't know why"
"He lives in a house,  a very big house in the country"
Watching afternoon repeats  and the food he eats in the country
Look here!
What's this?
Is this true?
I knew it.
I knew he was like that.
What is this?
His fan club must be in havoc.
The response today was really good.
All the messages were full of compliments.
Of course!
They complimented that the style was good.
As the model is good.
"But, when did you learn the drums?"
You were really good.
Did you see Won Kang Hwi's photo?
It's no joke!
That's right.
I felt he was gay.
Yes.
What is this?
What is this?
"But, did the two of them really do it?"
"All the things mentioned so far are the private affairs of our singer. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;U Entertainment has done our best to protect the privacy of Won Kang Hwi.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;However, judging that it could arouse social criticism,"

I wish that all thisput in evidence...
It's already been provenand is not applicable to this case.
"Mr. Judge,please listen to me! your requestto speak has been denied!"
"Please believe me,When I explain what my family has gone throughyou'll realize that was set a trap to my father !"

"I hereby bequeath, to the throne of Ptolemy, the land of Syria, to the limits of its borders!"
"Not only does he proclaim an Egyptian bastard as heir to Rome, he secedes the wealth of Syria to a foreign power!"
Shame!
Shame!

"In the summer of 1995 under my grandfather's favorite reading chair, I found a tattered"
Webster's International Dictionary.
In the back were ganged together and printed all the wonderful images from the book; a little universe of 19th century America.
"Little did I know I was about to devote the next 10 years of my life to organizing and printing 4,000 of these little blocks."
The Merriam Webster Company gifted these engravings to Yale University in 1977.
They now live in the press room of the Arts of the Book Collection.
I was enthralled when I first had a chance to see the engravings themselves.
I was fascinated by the numbers stamped and written onto their sides.
I spent much of 1997 identifying and organizing the collection into categories.
"I estimate there are about 13,000 of these little blocks."
Here are carriages and footware.
I used photocopies from the dictionaries to identify the blocks.
I then culled the images I was to print and organized them alphabetically.
Each engraving was logged out as part of a special loan agreement.
"At Quercus Press engravings were cleaned, often revealing amazing manuscript."
Most engravings were not type-high.
"Using various bits of paper, the engravings could be made"
level and raised so they could be printed properly.
Each engraving was then measured for labeling.
The latin names were added for flora and fauna.
The labels were then cast on my 1938 Model 8 linotype machine.
The linotype is really 3 machines at once.
"It composes a line of type, passes it, then redistributes it."
It's all done used these little brass mats.
"First, he promoted people based on merit, rather than family position, and, second, he brought lower classes of conquered people into his own tribe, while dispossessing the leaders of the conquered clans."
Thus he made peasants love him.
"The rich hated him, but they didn't matter anymore, because they were no longer rich."
"With these two building block policies,"
"Temujin was able to win the loyalty of more and more people and, in 1206, he was declared the Great Khan, the leader of all the Mongols."
How?
"Well, the Mongols chose their rulers in a really cool way."
"A prospective ruler would call a general council, called a kuriltai, and anyone who supported his candidacy for leadership would show up on their horses,"
literally voting with their feet.
Child John:
Mr. Green!
Mr. Green!
But horses don't have feet; they have hooves.
John:
"I hate you, Me From The Past."
"ALSO, NO INTERRUPTlNG THE THOUGHT BUBBLE!"
"After uniting the Mongols, Genghis Khan went on to conquer a lot of territory."
"By the time he died, in his sleep, in 1227, his empire stretched from the Mongol homeland, in Mongolia, all the way to the Caspian Sea."
"Thanks, Thought Bubble."
"So that's a pretty good looking empire and, sure, a lot of it was pasture, or mountains, or desert, but the Mongols did conquer a lot of people, too."
"And, in some ways, with Genghis' death, the empire was just getting started."
"His son, Ögödei Khan, expanded the empire even more, and Genghis' grandson, Möngke, was the Great Khan in 1258 when Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Empire, fell to the Mongols."
"And, another of Genghis' grandsons, Kublai Khan, conquered the Song Dynasty, in China, in 1279."
"And, if the Mamluks hadn't stopped another of Genghis' grandsons, at the battle of Ain Jalut, they probably would have taken all of North Africa."
"Man, Genghis Khan sure had a lot of grandkids."
"Well, it must be time for the open letter."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
An open letter to Genghis Khan's descendants.
"Oh, but, first, let's check what's in the secret compartment today."
(gentle electronic harp music playing)
"Oh, a noisemaker and champagne poppers."
"Stan, you know I suck at these."
"And what is more, Factory Farming corporations have been destroying communities and mistreating their workers for decades."
"Since 1950, over 2 million small hog farms have disappeared."
If they continue at this rate there'll be no real independent family farms left.
"That is the Meatrix, Leo."
The Lie we tell ourselves about where our food comes from.
"But it's not too late, there is a resistance."
Count me in!
Washington.
"City of politicians, policymakers, lobbyists and activists."
Think of the seals when you buy your meals.
Boycott Canada!
Today there's a demonstration against the seal hunt is held at the Canadian Embassy.
Think of the seals when you buy your meals.
Boycott Canada!
"This demonstration was organised by the Humane Society of the United States,"
America's largest animal welfare organisation with 10 million members.
"30 minutes later I have an appointment on Capitol Hill with Wayne Pacelle, the president of the Humane Society."
Hi.
- Welcome to the United States.
"Welcome to Washington, our nation's capital."
- Thank you.
We are so proud of what you've accomplished in Holland with your election.
We all took note last November of how you were elected and you're the first Party for the Animals in the world to achieve this.
"- Yes, that's true."
So thank you and we look forward to learning about what you have done.
"Oh, OK."
So nice to meet you finally.
You are the biggest organisation on animal welfare?
"Yes, we are."
"We have ten million supporters here in the United States in terms of paying supporters, and then of course we have millions more who believe in what we are doing, and we are here to organise that sentiment to achieve political reforms for animals, among doing other things."
"We try to pressure corporations to do the right thing and we educate the public, and we do hands-on care of animals as well."
But the political work here in Congress is very important.
I didn't nail it.
I screwed it up.
"Christine, let's go, please."
(Christine) I sauteed some onions with scallops and chicken stock that I had infused with smashed garlic and chili peppers.
You were almost frazzled by this dish.
"You have a extraordinary palate, but I think that one is subpar."
"Next up, Ryan."
"We have portobello, dried shiitake, and morel mushrooms."
I made a duxelle out of the three of them so that I can incorporate the mushrooms in every bite.
The consistency of the risotto itself was spot on. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Good technique&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;on the rice.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;
- Good job.
- Thank you very much.
"- All right, Scott."
"- Good luck, Scotty."
Let's do this.
This elimination challenge is definitely a chance for me to redeem myself with the judges.
"It means everything to show them that I can not only just bounce back, but actually really shine."
You think this has it?
Is this gonna be good?
I went back to where I normally cook.
I went as simple and core as I could to let the risotto speak for itself.
Seven ingredients in this entire dish.
- The texture's nice.
"- Thank you, chef."
Huge improvement over the last dish that we saw.
"A spirited effort, and, uh, welcome back to the contest."
"Thank you, Joe. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;(Joe)&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;So the next risotto&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;we want to taste&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;is from Tali.&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;"
Joe is definitely the scariest judge.
"He's the judge to win over, and, if I can do that, then the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Masterchef&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; title is definitely mine."
"I made a pistachio, cranberry, cherry, and gooseberry risotto."

It's every bit as exciting as it looks stepping into this thing.
It's visceral to the point of nirvana.
"It's fast, grippy, responsive, and has the best turn-in of any car I've never driven."
"It's wonderful, rewarding you when you get it just right, and kicking you in the ass when you overcook it."
"I stayed out, lap after lap, pushing the car as hard as I could, until I realized I was having so much fun, I'd run out of gas."
"While it's important to remember this car is a prototype, the production cars will be reaching customer hands at the beginning of next year."
And I can't wait to drive one of those.
"Now that we found out how well it grips on the track, let's see what happens when you try and break it loose."

"I thought this was a really good stunt, if you like, to highlight the difficulties faced by people with MS in walking 20 metres."
It doesn't look like a vast distance to have to walk but it depends on the day.
"If you've got MS, you can't pin down that you're going to be that well all the time."
It's different every day.
I think it's gone really really well.
It's nice to see that there's a lot of people on our side.
I think it's very good that we had an MP with us.
Stephen Lloyd (off camera):
"""I think a really good piece of campaigning from the MS Society."""
It's really nice that there's several different news people here.
Well I hope it's made people aware of what the problems are that people like us have.
I'm a bit more positive now than what I was earlier on.
I think today more than anything I felt proud; proud of what we're doing a proud of people with MS.

Students at Western illinois are trying to get drunk drivers off the road.
The university's emergency medical services hosted it's 16th annual Mock DUI project.
College volunteers show people what a drunk driving accident looks like.
"With prom and graduation right around the corner, officers say it's important to stop drunk driving."
Officer:
The numbers related to DUI accidents and fatalities is pretty staggering.
Everybody has somebody that they know or a loved one that knows someone that has been involved in a DUI accident or been killed in a vehicle accident of this nature.
Anchor:
"Local hospitals, police and fire departments help set up the event."
All emergency officials respond to the accident as if it was real.
"Cubs fans sing ""Go, Cubs, go"""
"White Sox fans chant ""Go, go, White Sox"""
"Both sets of fans say ""Go, CTA"""

[Laughing]
"But even so, even so I mean the fact of choosing, of selecting and deciding on one was the result of being very careful about not using my sense of beauty or my belief in some esthetics of some kind."
"In other words, finding some object of complete indifference as far as esthetics are concerned and that indifference is very difficult because there is always some detail in any object that will attract you esthetically."
"Meaning, that you find it beautiful or even ugly which is the same thing."
Ugly or beautiful is the same thing when it comes to choosing an object in the form of a Readymade.
"By Readymade, also the idea of it was being made by either manufactured or made by another person can be a Readymade, too, you see."
I even remember signing a big painting in a restaurant for the pleasure of calling it Readymade.
"You see, and of course it was not manufactured."
[Laughing]
"So, of course I couldn't take the painting with me because it was attached to the wall."
But this explains that the difficulty is to make people understand that was not through an attraction or the beauty of the object that I would call it Readymade.
"That's why I made so few because after a certain while, anything becomes beautiful."
"You know, it takes 40 years sometimes"
[Laughing]
but my - what is it called?
"Bottle Rack to be become - and people say,"
'It's so beautiful' and that's the worst complement they can give me.

But she never could get drunk enough
To get him off her mind
Until the night
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away his memory

"Can we act in a group, can we pull together?"
Ole:
"Yes, if we don't lift as a mass but as a Community"
"How do you see these ""occupied movement""?"
Is that community or is that mass?
Ole:
"Uhhhmmm .... they have a characteristic of the mass .. spontaneity, right? they are not organized .. but at the same time they are... directed at a goal and driven by an idealism and it moves them out of the mass concept"
Martin:
"And as you see it, the ideal and the goal is what?"
Ole:
"To prevent that resources are wasted and that human selfishness will shape government policies and in any way, the whole human living conditions"
"The mass never act normative, if it does, it is directed"
Martin:
It will be overruled?
Ole:
"Yes, as Hitler led the masses.."
Old:
But if the mass really follow standards that are freely chosen by the individual it's no longer a mass.. but something different.. movement
Martin:
But don't you see it as a movement?
Ole:
"Yes I do, also because they recruit to many different groups in society, right and to many age groups which is also extremely interesting"
Martin:
"Yes, but now as a global Prime Minister, you can do what you want, but"
You're also allowed to put some of these philosophical considerations on the line
Anything we could do in there?
I had another guest who suggested that we should teach philosophy right from the early grades
Ole:
"Well, I would say that it is well worthwhile to ask the question .. ""who am I""?"
Martin:
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for
I don't care what consequence it brings
I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad
I think you ought to know that
I intend to hold you for the longest time

"My name is John Green and I wanna welcome you to Crash Course ""World History"""
"Over the next 14 weeks together we will learn how in nearly 15,000 years humans went from hunting and gathering..."
"""Mr. Green, is this going to be on the test?"""
"Yeah, about the test."
"The test will measure whether you are an informed, engaged, and productive citizen of the world."
And it will take place in schools and bars and hospitals and dorm rooms and in places of worship.
"You will be tested on first dates, in job interviews, while watching football and while scrolling through your Tweeter feed."
The test will judge your ability to think about things other than celebrity marriages whether you will be easily persuaded by empty political rhetoric and whether you be able to place your life and your community in a broader context.
The test will last your entire life and it will be comprised of the millions of decisions that when taken together make your life yours and everything...everything will be on it.
"I know right, so pay attention!"
"In a mere 15,000 year humans went from hunting and gathering to creating such improbabilities as the airplane, the internet, and the 99 cent double cheeseburger."
"As the market for short stories disappeared, the market for science fiction novels began to grow and so there was this change of the short story as the"
"Epitome of science fiction, to the novel as the epitome of science fiction."
The Martian Chronicles is a hinge.
It's the first great science fiction novel.
"Although science fiction writers thought of it as fantasy, and were annoyed that Bradbury got this agilation to leap from the ghetto into the general consciousness, and it was, in fact, a book that got read as a book."
It was not just a fix up.
"It was, in fact, a composite novel."
We can see that if we take a look at the ways in which the stories changed from their original publication to the publication in the novel.
Bradbury bridges the publishing history from before the 1950's to after the 1950's.
"The Martian Chronicles is not only a wonderful work of literature, it is a milestone in the development of American culture."
The Valley of Tanayiku
"In Cou, 'Tanayiku' means ""A Place without Sorrow""."
"So, what does happiness mean in this Sans Souci?"
The happiest part for me is to work together with my people from the same tribe.
It's such a delight!
There was no way for me to co-work with my people before when I was working in other places
What are we working for?
For Tanayiku.
For all the community.
"It's such a pleasure, such a delight!"
That's it.
"Oh, I'm almost crying......"
The happiest thing for me is to get all of us together.
"Recovering from the typhoon disaster gradually,"
This is what makes me so happy.
Also I've learnt a lot from this place.
"For example, the interpersonal relationship"
"And also the working attitude, which is very important"
"Whenever I help my customers, I feel very happy."
"Although sometimes they complain to us, we still try our best to reply to their complaint nicely."
I have to work with pleasure everyday.
Because sometimes the visitors want to take a picture with me.
But the PAL-V is not the only flying car - or driving plane if you prefer - coming on to the market.
The US-based firm Terrafugia have just carried out successful tests on their own street-legal plane called the Transition.

MATT FARAH:
It's impossible to ignore the parallels between being in the desert and driving a race car.
"The feeling of isolation, your having total control over every aspect of the experience, and if something goes wrong, there's nothing there to save you."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
MATT FARAH:
Inde Motorsports Park is certainly remote enough out in the Arizona desert.
"The front straight doubles as a runway, so it's long, wide, and unforgiving."
"Rest of the two-mile circuit is bumpy, dusty, tight, and blind."
And the AVI Racing Corvette GT1 is probably the fastest track car I've ever driven.
"Or if not, it's certainly the loudest."
"In-car audio not, so much."
"I have no idea if you can hear me or not, this is by far the"
loudest car I've ever driven.
"AVl's Wayne McKeen, after putting tens of thousands into a C6 Corvette CO6 to go racing, had a revelation-- if you want to build a Corvette for the track, why start with a Corvette that's meant for the street."
That's like buying a casino when all you needed was a card table.
WAYNE MCKEEN:
I love Corvettes.
The geometry and the engineering that's went into the Corvette for a track car is unbelievable.
And we needed a stiff chassis to complement the geometry of the Corvette.
This car is a tube-frame GT1 Corvette race car.
"Essentially, a Corvette stock car, with a completely rebuilt, redesigned two-frame chassis that's extremely stuff."
[CAR ENGlNE ROARlNG]
WAYNE MCKEEN:
"The body of this car is made out of-- this current car-- is made out of fiberglass the production cars will be out of carbon fiber and Kevlar as an option, which saves about 80 pounds to the weight of the whole vehicle."
"And the chassis itself, dry weight is about 23-30 the way it sits."
"So, getting a stock zero 6 down under 3,000 pounds for a race car is extremely tough."
"What do you think you're talking to, you think you've been the world greatest husband"
"Please, I was there when you were flirting with exgirlfriend, and neglected to tell her you were married."
I was there when you were trying to hook up with that waitress the day before you got engaged.
"And I was definitely there when you were hooking with that nasty ass stripper at ""Boobies, Boobies, Boobies""."
That wasn't me that was you!
"Yeah, I know, but I told her my name was Turk"
"The point is, think of the millions of times you chose to not to hang out with your wife,'cause you were trying to hang out with me"
"You know, maybe it's time you start acting like a real husband"
Stop acting like some sort of crazy cowboy
A cowboy?
"I don't know, it just came to me"
"You know I'm right, Turk"
When your pride 's at stake* you can't help but have questions
Just tell me how did you know what was bothering her?
"Tell me now, so we don't have to talk anymore, never."
"How is it that no man understands that every woman, whether she's 16 or 60, still has that awkward, insecure, self-conscious teenage girl inside of her?"

"I was thinking, you'd rather just stay in tonight."
"You know have some pizza watch, watch some movies, what do you say?"
You are trying to smile?
You're so damned cute.
"Sometimes, sacrifice is only wearing a new uni when you are not at work"
"Okay, how about this one,Three blue-jays fly into a bar &amp;amp; they say, ""we just want to wet out beaks*"
"No, sorry Dan, you tell one"
"Other times, it's about swallowing that damn pride..."
"JD, could you hand me the wine, please?"
Turk is not talking to me
"But ulitmately, big or small, sacrifices is about doing something you really don't want to do"
"Hey guys, I know we talked about this before , but I'm moving out"

"Of course, the House of Representatives is very difficult there."
We're going to try to do more briefings and increase the bipartisan support for the program.
We have had some very encouraging republican interest shown recently in response to a lobby day that we did in
"February, and we'll keep working the Senate very aggressively."
"So, Bob thanks very much for those comments, and we'll have to watch closely for that $24 million set-aside for multi-family housing."
We'll watch how that plays out.
We just don't have the details right now.
Bob:
Right.
I'm aware.
Brad:
"So, I think that brings us to the end."
We have not received any further questions or comments.
We've had several people who have inquired about talking points for the member letter for the Senate.
"We'll be reaching out to you in the next several days, and yes we will send talking points out."
"That will be a very quick turn-around, and we do appreciate your help with that."

Hi!
So this week we are discussing women and comedy.
"And you'd probably be forgiven for thinking that there aren't that many women in the comedy scene,"
Man:
"But that's just because women are biologically more funny than women, everyone knows that..."
That's just people trying to increase available calories.
But one revolution leads to another.
"And pretty soon you have this, as far as the eye can see."
"Many historian also argue that without agriculture we wouldn't have the bad things that come with complex civilization, like patriarchy, inequality, war, and, unfortunately, famine."
"And as far as the planet is concerned, agriculture has been a big loser."
"Without it, humans would never have changed the environment so much, building dams, and clearing forests, and more recently drilling for oil that we can turn into fertilizer."
"Many people made the choice for agriculture independently, but does that mean that that was the right choice?"
"Maybe so, and maybe not."
"But regardless, we can't unmake that choice."
And that's one of the reasons why I think it is so important to study history.
"History reminds us that revolutions are not event, so much as they are processes."
"That for tens of thousands of years, people have been making decisions that irrevocably shaped the world that we live in today."
"Just as today we are making subtle, irrevocable decisions that people in the future will remember as revolutions."
"Next week, we are gonna journey to the Indus River...very fragile our globe."

"My name is Marianne Thieme and I'm a Member of Parliaments for the Party for the Animals in the Netherlands, and our party is the very first in the world to champion the rights of non-humans in a national parliament."
"However, there are other problems in the world aside from animal welfare."
So tonight I am going to tell you some very hard truths about what we are doing to our planet.
And I am so pleased that you are ready to face up to these realities ...
"If you look at the ten hottest years ever measured, they have all occurred in the last fourteen years."
The world is heating up fast and we have ourselves to blame.
Global warming is real and we humans are almost certainly the cause.
"Global warming, that's the world's greatest current concern."
Everyone finds themselves in its grip.
From scientists to politicians to the
Secretary General of the UN and even Leonardo di Caprio.
We face a convergence of crises.
Industrial civilisation has caused irreparable damage.
"By the middle of the century, there may be 150 million environmental refugees."
"Not only is it the 11th hour, it's 11.59."
"But, it's that other film, made by Nobel Prize Winner Al Gore, which has truly succeeded in putting this global problem on the map."
An Inconvenient Truth was a real wake-up call to the world!
This was a great achievement for Al Gore.
"However, he forgot something rather important."
The consequences of global warming are enormous.
The climate researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have estimated that by the year 2100 one to three billion people will be in dire need of fresh water.
Hunger will increase throughout large parts of the globe.
"So, it should come as no surprise that global warming is currently our foremost concern."
Everyone who has seen Al Gore's film knows that our Earth is in bad shape.
Greenhouse gas emissions must be reduced.
This is on the agenda of every world leader.
The causes of global warming must be dealt with now.
And so together we must identify the greatest emitters of greenhouse gasses in our society.
What do you think?
What are the sources of greenhouse gasses?
And the answer is no.
"But if you say, is there a way to reduce the two terms to one to a good approximation, the answer is yes."
"And the reason the answer is yes, is because to a good approximation, if you know, if you know R, and if you know this angle in between that angle."
Which we know that angle because we know all the coordinates.
You can estimate R prime with good accuracy.
"If we can find R prime, in terms of R, possibly also using that angle, Then we can reduce this expression from two terms, down to one."
Can you do that?
I'll leave it to you to see if you can figure it out.
So we'll conclude this segment with this nice picture of one of the main quads at
Duke University.
Thank you for watching this problem session.
We'll see you in the next segment.
Good evening friends.
"I am Shinzo Abe, representing the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan."
Hearty congratulations India Center on 10th Anniversary.
I am very impressed with this grand ceremony.
Mr. Vibhav is a good friend for the last ten years.
"I do not know anyone, who has passionately devoted his life to the relationship of India and Japan."
It was from Mr. Vibhav that I learned the greatness of India and the significance of strong friendship between India and Japan.
"Last year, Mr. Vibhav gave me an opportunity to visit India and there I have met many dignitaries."
"Including Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan."
India and China are the top two growing countries in Asia.
I believe that the key to the prosperous future of Japan is by learning from these countries' progress and growth.
"To strengthen relations between two countries, it is important that each countries think earnestly about the other."
This is the first step forward.
Mr. Vibhav is a very passionate man.
"Sometimes we get exhausted, because of his enthusiasm."
But I have realised that it is this passion and enthusiasm that is significantly inevitable.
"I am now in the position of the President of the LDP, and I attach importance to the friendship of India and Japan."
"With common values such as freedom, democracy, basic human rights, and feudal society,"
let's strategically establish and develop the relationship between the two countries.
"My grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, was the first Prime Minister to visit India."
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about transforming.

This is happening by itself.
It transforms through the magic of lighting.
It's all about sensuality.
It's all about touch.

"And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good in places that you wouldn't have felt good before."
It's about bringing nature to the inside.
"In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --"

It's about stimulation.
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.
"Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines, all explained to you by color and texture on the wall."
"And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida, where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,"
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
And I think I'll probably leave it at that.
Thank you very much.

"To set your grasslin timer, turn the dial on the front until the dial pointing to the correct time"
Slide the tabs to the outside for the period you want the timer to be on and ensure the remainder of the tabs are all pushed towards the middle.
In this example the timer will be on between midday and 6pm and off for the rest of the time.
"There is also a sliding switch on the timer, when at the bottom the timer is always off and when in the middle."
It is governed by the tabs around the dial
When this is at the top the timer is constantly on
The Power of Thought.
A person's thoughts are basically a processing of information and situations before him and we all have ideas and thoughts in our mind
And yet what we are doing about?
Our State Department isn't making peaceful contact
So we must.
Our Department of Energy is not funding non-classified projects dealing with these  science and technologies
So we must
And certainly the Pentagon is not disclosing this information and therefore
We must.
So this returns this whole issue to perhaps where it should be

"Fifteen years ago, if anybody would have told me"
"I'd be standing in front of you guys talking about food,"
I would have said they're totally nuts.
"Because I was in Texas, in business school, on a full scholarship."
"I was about to graduate as the top woman in my class, and I was being recruited by Enron, (Laughter) and the oil and gas industry."
I so wasn't a foodie.
"But I was so type A, and I channeled that into academia, and what I decided to do - I wasn't really interested in Enron, thank goodness - and I decided to go into the investment world as an analyst, and I covered the food industry."
"And I was so completely inept at this whole food thing that when Martha Stewart came through our offices bringing her company public, and everybody had her sign the cookbooks,"
I had her sign the financial statements.
(Laughter)
I couldn't cook.
"So when my husband and I decided to move here 12 years ago,"
I traded the briefcase for a diaper bag.
"And as I learned how these other countries had either not allowed these ingredients, or insisted on labeling, believing that their citizens had a right to know about these ingredients in the food,"
I couldn't unlearn this information.
"And I know correlation isn't causation, but we have one of the highest cancer rates on the planet."
The American Academy of Pediatrics has linked pesticides to ADHD and hyperactivity in kids.
"And the President's Cancer Panel has recently urged all of us to reduce our exposure to these chemicals in an effort to try to prevent the onset of these diseases, which according to the New England Journal of Medicine is placing an increasing burden on our economy."
"And I got it, it was a business model."
"But at the same time, I couldn't unlearn this."
And I struggled with what people might call me.
I'd dismissed it as a hippie thing;
lifestyle of the rich and famous.
And I really didn't want to put my face on this movement.
"And yet I sat across the table one night from my husband and I said, ""I can't unlearn this."""
"And so we sat the kids down the next morning, and I said, ""You know how mom's learned about how we have all these ingredients in our food and we didn't know?"
"I'm going to have to try to teach others about it."""
"And one of the boys looked at me and he said,"
"""Mom, how many people are on your team?"""
(Laughter)
"And I said, ""Well, it's you four... and daddy."""
(Laughter)
"And he said, ""Mom, you need a bigger team."""
(Laughter)
"And people were telling me to reach out to Erin Brockovich; they were saying, ""You're food's Erin Brockovitch."""
And people were telling me to reach out to Bobby Kennedy because he was really involved with food politics.
"And I'm from a conservative family, (Laughter) and I thought, ""I can't."""
(Laughter)
"But at the same time, I thought, ""You know, I have to at least try, and I do have all of these type A genes."""
"And so I harnessed them, and I spent a couple of weeks around the Christmas of 2006 drafting a very short e-mail to Erin Brockovitch."
"And when she actually responded,"
"I thought, ""You know, maybe one person can make a difference."""
"Then later that spring, I took all of the data and of the research that I had done, and I spent a good two weeks in a Kinko's office binding it, and shipping it off to Bobby Kennedy."
"And when his Chief of Staff called, she had me on speakerphone."
"And to this day, I still don't know who was in that room, but she said,"
"Senator Harkin has been a key defender of the program, chairs the Senator Appropriations Subcommittee."
He will be retiring.
He will be here for two years.
"That's going to be a big, big change."
"In the House, Congressman Rehberg of Montana has been the chair."
Montana is a big CSBG state.
"It's a very, very important program there."
I think something like 10% of the population are beneficiaries of it.
"Of course Jim Nolan now retired, a great advocate for CSBG had helped with Congressman Rehberg who was defeated in his run for the Senate."
So the new Chair of the Labor HHS subcommittee is going to be very powerful for the future of CSBG.
"A gentleman by the name of Jack Kingston comes from Savannah, Georgia."
"How do you, Arley and Mark, see over the past several years, the approps process has unraveled."
CSBG has gone onto a continuing resolution which actually has helped CSBG because it forced all the cuts.
"What do you see happening this year with the change with Rehberg gone with a new Chairman who perhaps is not interested in CSBG to the degree that Rehberg was, how do you see that playing out in the approps process?"
"Arley: in working with CSBG, especially the last two or three years, because of Senator Tom Harkin and his support, and others in the Senate and people in the House, they concentrate a lot of their efforts in the Senate."
We know full well that Harkin and others in the Senate have held CSBG.
You know the
President wanted to cut it a couple years ago.
"Going forward, we know Senator Harkin was a big supporter."
"We know that he'll still be Chair of the subcommittee that he chairs, and we expect that there will be some strength there."
"The House has always been a bit more difficult to navigate, even before when David Obey was Chair, CSBG was also very well supported."
When Obey left it became a bit more trying.
Rehberg was a big supporter.
Kingston is a lot more frugal from what we can tell.
He's been a lot quicker to cut programs and cut overall federal spending.
We're beginning our meetings and our discussions with that new committee and with the new Chair as we begin to navigate the CSBG water.
It doesn't help us that the cut is coming from the administration.
"It's a very progressive, democratic administration that's saying that they want these cuts as well."
"It's an uphill battle, I will kid you not."
But we will pull out all the stops.
"Initially, I would say it's not favorable going in, but we remain optimistic at all times."
Brad:
"I really want to communicate a message with everybody, I'd just tell everybody."
I certainly wouldn't pick languages that die off and things that are temporary.
-Thomas Payne made a very good argument that god would never use anything written to communicate a message.
-I happen to agree.
Maybe god knows something that I don't.
Maybe there really is some benefit to vaguely inspiring inviduals to write down those important messages on manuscripts that get lost and destroyed in languages that change and die.
But somehow I've missed the obvious benefit of all that.
-Right.
"If god really wanted to do that, he could have."
"But apparently he was unaware of this technology when he wrote with his finger, according to the bible, on stone tablets, the 10 commandments."
This is in Exodus.
"Instead, he used magic lightweight invisible crumble-stone."
Where do we get that?
"Well, it's magic because he made it."
"It's lightweight because Moses carried, a 90-year-old guy, was carrying them up and down the mountains."
"-But back then, 90 was like 20."
-I guess so.
"And invisible because we don't have any trace of them today and crumble-stone because they all broke, supposedly."
And god seems to have some issues with metal.
He hates these molten calves that they make of images of little calves that people were worshipping.
And he just thinks that's really awful.
And this is one of your favorites.
"In Judges 1:19,"
"'And the lord was with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.'"
Spooky.
Spooky.
"So, mostly likely the mythology surrounding the stone tablets was a coveting of some other stone tablets somewhere else, the Code of Hammurabi, dating to 1772 BCE, that currently exist, for real, unlike the stone tablets of Jewish"
law.
These are housed in the Louvre museum in Paris.
I've seen them.
"-Although to be fair, the 2nd set of stone tablets supposedly still exist, hidden away in the ark which supposedly still exists in a location that only the devout are aware of."
"Nice open format there, god."
"An emergency fund could take the form of cash, checking accounts, savings account money market funds or even certificate deposits at a bank or a credit union."
"These funds, should not be subject to any sort of major market risk."
"Some people might consider equity in their house or access to their credit part of their emergency fund, but, still a foundation of cash and cash equivelants is, is, still the best and very important, because access to credit could suddenly dry up or be hard to get in an emergency."
An emergency fund is also vital to tapping into assets I'm sorry emergency fund is also vital to avoid tapping into assets that may have been earmarked for your long-term goals.
"In the next lesson, we'll talk about setting some financial goals."

"I felt like this sense of inspiration and possibility that always hit people at TED, we just needed to do something with that."
There was so much potential there to make a difference in the real world.
What could we do?
"So, at the end of TED 2003,"
"I urged the audience to consider getting behind some of these big, wild causes"
"like AlDS, fresh water, you know,  the ocean's crisis."
"And, some people loved it."
"And, some really didn't."
"I mean, the truth is, one person's cause is another person's ""Dear God, please shoot me now""."
"And, it is!"
"In a conference filled on how people re-discover wonder, a sense of possibility, curiosity, you have to be really careful what you kind of do that might be perceived as cramming something down someone's throat."
"So, a few longstanding members of the TED community were thorouly pissed off, and actually left. and I thought I might have blown it."
"However, that little kerfuffle led to something very special."
"A group of us went away for a weekend, and we brain-stormed about, look, there's got to be a way to do this."
This stuff really matters.
"It's actually, inherently, quite interesting"
How do we bring to it to TED in a more TED-like way?
"And, what that led to was this."
"So, every year, we bring 3 remarkable people to TED and give them this unique proposition."
Come and make a wish.
Tell us your dream.
You can make one wish without restriction.
"This process has, first of all, allowed us to bring people to TED we could never have brought."
"Second, it brought to the conference, the world biggest issues in a way that seemed different, magical, exciting, and in a way which led to an extraordinary range of collaborative projects that frankly wouldn't have happened in any other way."
"One is ""One.org."""
"Cameron Sinclair is in the room actually, TED prize winner, Cameron."

It's nice having your own band.
"Please have a seat, everyone."
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
"Thank you, Secretary Salazar, for that introduction and for your hard work to preserve and protect our land and our water and our wildlife."
"I also want to thank Minister Rogers for the beautiful invocation, as well as Neil Mulholland and everyone at the"
National Park Foundation and the National Park Service who helped put this outstanding event together.
"I'd like to thank Carson Daly and Big Time Rush, and all of tonight's performers for joining us to kick off the holiday season here at the White House."
"For 89 years, Presidents and Americans have come together to"
light the National Christmas Tree.
And this year is a special one.
"This year, we have a brand new tree."
The last one stood here for more than 30 years -- until we lost it in a storm earlier this year.
But we all know that this tradition is much larger than any single tree.
"And tonight, once again, we gather here not simply to light some decorations, but to honor a story that lights the world."
"More than 2,000 years ago, a child was born to two faithful travelers who could find rest only in a stable, among the cattle and the sheep."
But this was not just any child.
Christ's birth made the angels rejoice and attracted shepherds and kings from afar.
He was a manifestation of God's love for us.
"And He grew up to become a leader with a servant's heart who taught us a message as simple as it is powerful: that we should love God, and love our neighbor as ourselves."
That teaching has come to encircle the globe.
It has endured for generations.
"And today, it lies at the heart of my Christian faith and that of millions of Americans."
"No matter who we are, or where we come from, or how we worship, it's a message that can unite all of us on this holiday season."
"So long as the gifts and the parties are happening, it's important for us to keep in mind the central message of this season, and keep Christ's words not only in our thoughts, but also in our deeds."
"In this season of hope, let's help those who need it most -- the homeless, the hungry, the sick and shut in."
"In this season of plenty, let's reach out to those who struggle to find work or provide for their families."
"In this season of generosity, let's give thanks and honor to our troops and our veterans, and their families who've sacrificed so much for us."
And let's welcome all those who are happily coming home.

He studied business and I studied economics and Sinology.
"When he finished his studies, he asked himself, what to do?"
Then he had the following idea:
"This is myrrh, a natural resin from the myrrh-tree."
And this myrrh-tree finds extremely well climate conditions in Somalia.
Therefor this is the resource - here you can smell it - please give it to your neighbors -
- for which the world still needs Somalia.
Then Ahmed had the idea to import myrrh from Somalia to Germany.
"This is used in shampoos, in many cometics, medicine as well. - the back rows will be happy if you pass it on."
"Ahmed founded a firm for this export business, here Mercatus GmbH, in Hobrecht Street 28, Berlin."
This firm is also the kitchen of his flat.
"The business works well, but sometimes he looses control."
Which is mainly due to Somalia and the civil war there.
And now actually comes the main punchline of this evening.
"Mister Liu Xenfang from Hongkong, who built the National Theatre in Somalia, who now runs a shop in Nairobi, found Ahmed's firm on the internet."
"He had the idea to invest in this myrrh-business, buy myrrh from ahmed, sell it to the far east."
But he heard that the myrrh from Somalia is often shit.
"There's goat-shit in it, or splints of shell or other shit."
"He didn't want this, therefor he wanted to check the situation on the ground himself."
"In summer 2011 Ahmed and Liu planned a journey to the Horn of Africa, in order to sort things out with the farmers there."
"And Ahmed asked me to join this journey, to make research there, and develop a theatre play out of it."
And then I searched in Germnay for people to participate in this.
"Hello, my name is Chang Bee, I come from Taiwan."
"I studied classical singing in Taiwan, this means, learning to sing in the way that the european opera needs."
Therefore I wanted to go to Europe when I finshed my studies in Taiwan.
"In order to learn it even better, where this aesthetic comes from."
And I went to Berlin for an entrance examination.
Somalia is not the kind of country where one can travel spontaneously.
I wandered about security concerns in advance of our journey.
"I wanted to plan it well, wanted to know which places are really dangerous, then we could figure out a route which is not critical, or do I have to cancel it all, because it's to dangerous everywhere?"
"When you make a good plan in Taiwan, you ask an authority which can tell you."
I asked my teacher when I wanted to go to Europe.
See you!

"[INAUDlBLE] here at Berkeley I go by Rabbit and I'm one of the TA's, and today's lecture is about concurrency. today's news of the day is friendship paradox."
"Two weeks ago, a research project came to us, that they surveyed Facebook users."
It's pretty cool.
"And they found one, along other things."
"One of the things they found is that on average, your friends are more popular than you."
"This is weird, but on average, the average Facebook user has 250 Facebook friends, while their friends on average have 350."
Pretty interesting.
"What happens is this is actually a paradox that happens in real life everywhere and they are like gatekeepers that are, know a lot of people, and a lot of people know them, and they are very common, and chances are that you're friends with them and that would bring up the average rather than knowing the other people that know random people. other than that, personally, I'd like to tell you to double-check your Facebook privacy settings."
Your Facebook privacy settings have been changed and they changed about once a month and they changed it for you.
"So, double-check it."
Awesome.
"So, this is going to be hard."
Okay.
"So, today, we're talking with parallelism and there are two main types of parallelism, intra-computer and inter-computer."
"Intra is inside one computer and this is the idea of having multiple course, multiple CU, CPUs inside one computer, and then, they work together to solve one common problem. this happens in most computers nowadays, anything you buy has [INAUDlBLE] of course. inter-computer is bigger."
"It's the warehouse scale computers where you have thousands, hundreds of thousands of computers working together to solve a common problem."
"This is called distributed computing and there are two main types, grid and cluster computing."
"Grid computer, grid computing is the idea that you just took lots of computing, of computers and put them together."
"And, now you use them as one big computer and very strong one."
"This is useful, but it's not as uniform."
Hypersensitives are born different from everyone else.
"They can have visions of the future, or see the dead... ...and sometimes be uniquely susceptible... ...to invasion by an entity that is alien to them."
Objection.
On what grounds?
"How about silliness, Your Honor?"
A young girl suffered terribly and died.
Do we have to subject her illness to this pseudoscientific analysis?
"Both counselors, please approach the bench."
"Your Honor, this testimony is beyond ridiculous."
Visions...
Supernatural belief systems are shared by millions of people.
We're in *The Twilight Zone* here.
Her expertise is relevant to the issues in this case.
Let's have a witch doctor sift through bones...
Stop.
We've heard a great deal of testimony... ...in support of a medical explanation for Emily's condition.
Now we have a witness who has spent her career... ...studying the defense's alternative explanation.
"An exorcism expert, if you will."
I think we'll hear what she has to say.
"Thank you, Your Honor."
"Dr. Adani, why do you think Emily's exorcism failed?"
The medical treatment.
"Specifically, the drug Gambutrol."
Please explain.
The exorcism ritual results in a specific brain activity... ...that cuts the person off from the possession experience.
But Emily's exorcism could not have achieved this... ...because the doctor gave her Gambutrol... ...which has an intoxicating effect on the brain.
The drug made her immune to the psycho-spiritual shock... ...that exorcism is intended to provide.
What do you believe was the result of treatment with this intoxicating drug?
Gambutrol locked Emily in the possessed state.
"This left her unable to respond to the exorcism... ...and therefore, it directly contributed to her death."
"Thank you, doctor."
No further questions.
"""Driven to the last necessity, and obliged to have recourse to arms in defense of our lives and"
"liberties."""
"So they're saying, 'We're not rebels who are out to rebel against the King."
"We're actually--We've been driven to this by what's going on in Massachusetts and we're protecting ourselves, but this is a defensive act and not an aggressive act.'"
"And then when you read a little further on in the statement, after all of this sort of noble, lofty sentiment, they then promise each other they're not going to get drunk or gamble or swear."
[laughs]
It's down to practicalities.
"Now that we've declared our purpose to the world, no heavy drinking."
Okay.
"The next day, April 22,1775, classes at Yale were suspended and a lot of students went home."
"Some, a few, actually, went off to fight."
So you can kind of see the way that the wind is blowing in New
Haven.
"You can imagine, given these sorts of events potentially how much fun it would have been to be a college student with Loyalist leanings at this particular moment."
It would not have been very fun--and sure enough in 1775 there was that student.
I discovered that student this morning.
"There was a--I don't know if he's the only one, but he's the guy who got in trouble."
There was one college student here at Yale who was a declared
"Loyalist, 1775."
He did not make other Yale students very happy.
He must have been loud about being a Loyalist.
"Otherwise don't know how it would have been so obvious to everyone that he was a Loyalist, but the--a large chunk of the"
Yale student body decided to have a meeting to debate what should be done about this student.
Okay.
"Obviously, things are not going to go well for the student."
'What should we do about this student?'
"They decide that they are going to formally denounce him as-- publicly, as, quote, ""an enemy to his country""-- and that no one will be allowed to socialize with this student ever again."
Okay.
They've just ostracized this--Can you imagine?
Sorry.
'You've just been entirely ostracized from every other person at Yale University [laughs] because we don't like your politics.'
"So when I first found this this morning, I was like: oh, poor guy, and I couldn't figure out what happened next and I just felt sorry for him."
Ole:
It could of course be true
Martin:
But it is also different to compete in the artistic substance than just compete in who can jump highest; ... and run the fastest... is there a difference in these things?
Ole:
"Yes but unfortunately they did that too but they had competitions in oratory and theater and so on, as you mention but it is a competition where you will be honored by the community as well as there's competitions in the immediate self sacrifice for the community that isthe greatest honor that can happen to you"
"Whoever wins this contest winner on behalf of the community and it's not how competition works in our culture but it may well be that competition as a phenomenon has paid off just like the life struggle has done because if people had not been forced to work for a living, perhaps they had not created ​​the things they have"
Martin:
So it's a side effect we are talking about and not competition in general?
Ole:
"No, it's very complicated."
Martin:
But then you're now touching the whole basis of the free market
Ole:
What it has led to're highly problematic and where they have attempted to tie them through government controls have indeed created some absolutely terrible results
Martin:
So it could have been done otherwise?
Ole:
Then it really should be done otherwise!
You have to prevent a concentration of power and one can only imagine the slow transitions
Martin: but we havn't got the time..
Ole:
"No, we havn't got the time if we are to achieve it within your prediction horizon"
Martin:
What would you do first if you were to start a positive process now?
Ole:
"Then we should start tomorrow already by going out in town and tell every person you meet no matter if you know the them or not, something nice about them ...and then see what happens.."
It's actually not that easy..
Martin:
"It's probably not so easy, no... and if everyone did it at once.. it would be a great day for everyone.."
Ole:
"A fantastic day, right.."
Listen to this:
It is known now that chocolate is the number one longevity food in the world.
That is known.
"It is the number one food for your heart  according to the research, for your heart."
It's also a great way to party and have a good time  without a hangover.
Chocolate grows across  the temp required that the -- what we call the tropical belt  of the world; from about 20 degrees north latitude  to 20 degrees south latitude.
In that belt.
And it's originally from the Americas:
"Central America,"
"Venezuela, Ecuador."
Most people now believe that chocolate  is originally from the Orinoco river basin of Venezuela.
"That's where the Spanish first rolled into and saw tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands  of wild cacao trees, but no people, 500 years ago."
I searched all over the planet.
I visited shamans asking them  what they thought about chocolate.
"This shaman in the Amazon told me  that you can take the cacao tree bark, peel it off, soak it in ice-cold water."
"It releases the gel in 24 hours, and when you rub that in your scalp, it cures male pattern baldness."
I'm an infopreneur.
"My eyes went into dollar signs,  when I heard that."
"You mean, there is a product that would sell more than chocolate itself, that comes from the chocolate tree?"
And we're researching this right now.
First and foremost I am a researcher.
"That's what I love to do, I love to study, research and look into the data."
"Chocolate is the number one food in magnesium of any food in the world, that is the number one mineral deficiency in the Western world."
"Also, chocolate is the highest  natural source of iron, the highest natural source of manganese and the highest natural source of chromium of any major food in the world."
These are very important minerals  for blood building.
"They're very important for stable blood sugar and, of course, magnesium de-stresses us."
Could we use that?
I think so.
"Chocolate is also extraordinarily rich in phosphorus, zinc and copper."
Zinc and copper for healthy nervous system  and phosphorus for bone.
"We always hear about calcium,  calcium, calcium."
"Phosphorus,  we need that for healthy bones."
This institute is made for special needs people
They teach them Quran and the Deen.
we are now in chechnya in one of the ultimate Quran institute
This institute was built in 1904 - very old institute but it was renovated recently [in the past few years]
The strange thing about this institute is that there's 100 student- from them are normal students who memorize theQuran and from them [around 25 students] are special needs
"Those who are deaf, unable to speak and unable to see. and from one of the beautiful examples in this institute is a young man who's Russian"
"He converted to Islam, and he has this great keenness in wanting to learn the Quran, Keep in mind he's blind yet he wants to learn the Quran, ofcourse through braille and wants to memorize it as well."
MashaAllah i heard that he learned how to read braille in a small period of time and learned how to read the Quran very well.. how long did it take him to learn it?
"To be honest, to learn the correct way so that you can prefect the reading.. it takes a long period of time"
But i learned the basic of braille [connecting the letters and words together] in 2 days.
"This is due to that fact that I already knew how to read braille in Russian language and English, so I didnt find difficulty in learning the Arabic one."
Okay but why do care so much about leanring
Why does he want to learn this fast and is trying to seek nearness to Allah?
I have always had a desire to learn the Language of the Quran so that I can read it
This is why I left university of Moscow and came here.
I Ask Allah to ease my way in seeking this knowledge for his sake.
Does he enjoy it?
"- Ofcourse, with no doubt."
- This is concidered his Jannah on Earth
- He has found the Jannah of This dunyah by learning this language for the sake of learning the Speech of Allah.
"Allahu Akbar, this is beautiful!"
"- As you've heard, he left his studies and family to come and learn the Quran"
I asked him do you enjoy what you do? he said:
"Indeed I found the Heaven of This Dunyah by Learning the Quran. by Allah, this is a beautiful answer."
I heard that this young man is a soccer player in the National Team of Russia?
Yes I do play soccer with the National team of Russia that's made especially for blind people and we won the European cup just recently in Portugal
"So not only is he focusing on learning how to read braille in arabic, but he's also working on Quran memorization and he still active in other ways, the likes of his favorite sports and such"
He has many goals mashaAllah.
But our request is for him to Read to us
Surat An'baa:
"""About what are they asking one another?"
About the great news..That over which they are in disagreement
"By one measure, the US stock of money is now $8.7 trillion--up 12% since last year."
And some people are still pocketing a huge share of that cash.
"Last year, despite the onset of the biggest financial crisis since the Depression, his hedge fund paid George Soros a cool $2.5 billion."
That's roughly 41 000 times more than the average American family earned.
"As they say on Wall Street,"
"""Way to go."""
"Now however, imagine a world with no money."
"500 years ago, the most powerful society in South America, the Inca Empire, had no real concept of money."
The Incas appreciated the aesthetic qualities of rare metals.
Gold was the sweat of the sun.
"Silver, the tears of the moon."
"Labour was the unit of value in the Inca Empire, just as it was later supposed to be in a Communist society."
"But in 1532, the Incas ran into a man whose hunger for money had led him across an ocean."
Francisco Pizarro and his fellow conquistadors had come from Spain to what the called
"Upper Peru, inspired by the legend of Eldorado-- the realm of the gold-covered king."
"After defeating the Inca army at the Battle of Cajamarca, their quest began in earnest."
"At Potosi, in what is now Bolivia, the Spaniards struck it rich."
They discovered the Cerro Rico--
"literally, the ""rich hill""."
"Towering nearly 16 000 feet above sea level, it was a money mountain."
"In that 250 years of Spanish rule, more than 2 billion ounces of silver were extracted from mines like this one-- 14 000 feet up in the Andes."
What the Incas couldn't grasp was why the Europeans had such an insatiable lust for gold and silver.
They couldn't understand that to
"Pizarro and the Conquistadors, silver was much more than just shiny metal."
"It could be made into money-- a store of value, a unit of account-- portable power."
"I must say, I find this place pretty harrowing."
"Spaniards had a system of forced labour, which meant that every able-bodied male in the native population had to do a stint down in these mines."
And you can see why 1 in 8 of them didn't survive the ordeal.
"Today, 500 years later, conditions for miners in the Cerro Rico haven't improved much."
But at least they get paid for the work they do.
"In those days, it was a way of making money but verged on genocide."
"The silver ore was ground up, refined with mercury, and then shipped to Europe as bars and coins. made the Spanish crown rich beyond the dreams of avarice."
"I thought to myself,  ""That is a good idea."""
"Mindfulness Without Borders not only develops programs  for health-care provider, professionals and the adults that surround youth, but let's do something for youth as well."
"And in time, with a group  of wonderful practitioners, and educators and lay people, and the younger generation thinkers, we developed curriculum called  The Mindfulness Ambassador Council."
"What separates us, I believe,  from the strictly mindfulness curriculum is that we wed social and emotional  competencies into the program."
It is 12 weeks.
"We teach and facilitate conversations in a council, where we value everybody's voice equally,  where there is no discrimination."
No discrimination.
(Laughs)
"And where we appreciate diversity, where we build self-esteem and, more than ever, where we hear people, we hear anyone who is in our council."
"We hear their voices, and we value them."
"So, our core values in the organization  are core concepts of mindfulness."
Our programs that we built  are core concepts of mindfulness.
"And we start off with breathing,"
We start off with using the breath  to bring us into the present moment.
We move into understanding and  talking about some of the challenges that prevent us from being our best self.
"We develop conversation around being compassionate, empathetic, understanding."
And all through the council process where  we just deeply listen to one another.
"It has been remarkable journey, and I think that if we all begin to take what we know best, model mindfulness to others, and advocate for that together as a community,"
I think we will be stronger.
I know we are in 23 states of Toronto  capital and district school board.
"And had it not for two lovely women who  are here, Rita Mamon and Diane Benasco, we would have never gone  as deep as we have there."
We plan to expand the roots  and we look to you as advocates.
"So, thank you and if you want  to learn more, we have a faculty here and we are in the bookstore there."
Thank you very very much.
"(R. Brady) Thank you, Theo."
Can we have one bell?
(Half bell) (Bell)
(R. Brady) Our next speaker  will be Jon Kristian Salunga.
Jon is a classroom teacher  in a high school in San Diego.
"He teaches English and like many of you, he teaches in public schools."
It is probably not so easy  to actually teach a practice so that may not be  the door you come in.
We will hear from Jon  about the door he has entered.
"And today, it's something enjoyed by about 300,000 people every day."
"Tela mentioned, more than 100 million TED talks have been viewed."
"When you think about that, it's strange, you know, 100 million lectures viewed on the Internet, who would've thought?"
How did it happen?
This event here today actually seems equally miraculous to me.
TED itself had really nothing to do with organizing it.
"And, trust me, organizing an event like this takes a huge amount of effort."
"And, yet, it's one of more than 100 would be held this year around the world as part of this TEDx program of independently organized TED events."
The program still in Beta hasn't really even started yet.
No one is making any money.
"This is being done for passion, curiosity."
How did that happen?
So I should warn you that the story I will tell it's not like a top-down plan of some determination to propagate TED to the world.
I think you'll discover TED has a life of its own.
"More mysterious than that, it's a story of a very strange, but I think beautiful, cultural phenomenon that has emerged out of a really remarkable community, which by the way includes you."
"So, TED past, present, and future."
TED started as an experiment in convergence.
"The brilliant Richard Wurman and Harry Marks figured it out 25 years ago that industries of technology, entertainment, and design were converging, that if you brought together the people from those 3 worlds, they would have interesting things to say to each other."
"So, it turned out the first TED held in 1984 showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and Sony showed off this strange, shiny, silver, round disks containing digital sounds which were the first CDs."
"And both objects, if you like, oozing technology, entertainment, and design."
People were wowed.
Event lost money and wasn't held again for another 6 years.
"But, after that -- (Laughter) after that it's been held annually,"
It really took off.
"And, strange things started to happen."
The content broadened.
"In addition to the T, E, and D, of TED, in came story tellers, adventurers, entrepreneurs, business leaders, just ordinary human beings with a surprising story to tell."
"Remarkably, instead of the audience going,"
"""oh, this is diluted."
"This is losing relevance to me."", they loved it."
Why?
Why?
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high They reach the sky
And like my dreams They fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
United!
United!
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.
(Laughter)
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.
"And you're on the outside, you're at home."
"You're like the Raspyni Brothers, where you've got your balls in cold water."
And -- (Laughter) -- you just play with your fingers all day.
And then you get invited.
"And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be."
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it's over.
And it's only taken five minutes.
And you want to go back and do it again.
But I really appreciate being here.
"And thank you, Chris, and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible."
"So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit, within the subject of creation and optimism."
"And if you put creation and optimism together, you've got two choices that you can talk about."
"You can talk about creationism -- which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience, at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z."
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
"But any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here, setting up TED, small-scale architecture -- at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this, the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us."
"Because if architecture is what I believe it to be, which is the built form of our cultural ambitions, what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?"
And our own opportunity to make something new there?
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
"I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way, brought architecture into focus in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time, and made it a subject for common conversation."
(Guitar music throughout)
Music is a language.
Both music and verbal languages serve the same purpose.
They are both forms of expression.
They can be used as a way to communicate with others.
They can be read and written.
"They can make you laugh or cry, think or question, and can speak to one or many."
And both can definitely make you move.
"In some instances, music works better than the spoken word, because it doesn't have to be understood to be effective."
"Although many musicians agree that music is a language, it is rarely treated as such."
"Many of us treat it as something that can only be learned by following a strict regimen, under the tutelage of a skilled teacher."
"This approach has been followed for hundreds of years with proven success, but it takes a long time."
Too long.
Think about the first language you learn as a child.
"More importantly, think about how you learned it."
"You were a baby when you first started speaking, and even though you spoke the language incorrectly you were allowed to make mistakes."
"And the more mistakes you made, the more your parents smiled."
Learning to speak was not something you were sent somewhere to do only a few times a week.
And the majority of the people you spoke to were not beginners.
They were already proficient speakers.
Imagine your parents forcing you to only speak to other babies until you were good enough to speak to them.
You would probably be an adult before you could carry on a proper conversation.
"To use a musical term, as a baby, you were allowed to jam with professionals."
"If we approach music in the same natural way we approached our first language, we will learn to speak it in the same short time it took to speak our first language."
Proof of this could be seen in almost any family where a child grows up with other musicians in the family.
Here are a few keys to follow in learning or teaching music.
"In the beginning, embrace mistakes, instead of correcting them."
"Like a child playing air guitar, there are no wrong notes."
Allow young musicians to play and perform with accomplished musicians on a daily basis.
Encourage young musicians to play more than they practice.
The more they play the more they will practice on their own.
"Music comes from the musician, not the instrument."
"And I guess you inject it into maybe an ostrich egg, or something like that, and then you wait, and, lo and behold, out pops a little baby dinosaur."
And everybody's happy about that.
(Laughter)
And they're happy over and over again.
They keep doing it; they just keep making these things.
"And then, then, then, and then ..."
"Then the dinosaurs, being social, act out their socialness, and they get together, and they conspire."
"And, of course, that's what makes Steven Spielberg's movie -- conspiring dinosaurs chasing people around."
"So I assume everybody knows that if you actually had a piece of amber and it had an insect in it, and you drilled into it, and you got something out of that insect, and you cloned it, and you did it over and over and over again, you'd have a room full of mosquitos."
(Laughter) (Applause)
And probably a whole bunch of trees as well.
"Now if you want dinosaur DNA,"
I say go to the dinosaur.
So that's what we've done.
"Back in 1993 when the movie came out, we actually had a grant from the National Science Foundation to attempt to extract DNA from a dinosaur, and we chose the dinosaur on the left, a Tyrannosaurus rex, which was a very nice specimen."
"And one of my former doctoral students,"
"Dr. Mary Schweitzer, actually had the background to do this sort of thing."
"And so she looked into the bone of this T. rex, one of the thigh bones, and she actually found some very interesting structures in there."
"They found these red circular-looking objects, and they looked, for all the world,"
like red blood cells.
And they're in what appear to be the blood channels that go through the bone.
"And so she thought, well, what the heck."
So she sampled some material out of it.
Now it wasn't DNA; she didn't find DNA.
"But she did find heme, which is the biological foundation of hemoglobin."
And that was really cool.
That was interesting.
That was -- here we have 65-million-year-old heme.
Well we tried and tried and we couldn't really get anything else out of it.
"So a few years went by, and then we started the Hell Creek Project."
"And the Hell Creek Project was this massive undertaking to get as many dinosaurs as we could possibly find, and hopefully find some dinosaurs that had more material in them."
"And out in eastern Montana there's a lot of space, a lot of badlands, and not very many people, and so you can go out there and find a lot of stuff."
"I can't take it anymore, move out of the way"
Mr.Mahmoud wants you
What does he want?
"What are you doing, dad?"
"Come on, world cup is approaching"
We're gonna fight now
What?
Come on Karim
He never even played boxing
"Shut up Karim, why don't you just tell him about all of this?"
I don't wanna play!
Man up!
Stop
Put your arms up like this yeah liek this to protect yourself and the glasses?
Give me the glasses
Raise your hands up
Yeah protect your face well Karim
Ok
"Come on, dress up"
Morning Ellen
I believe you're going to give us an update on some of the work you've been doing?
Yes - last time I did a blog I'd just began treatment on this beautiful lentoid and now I've actually finished it.
And I've updated the housing for the object and now you can see all the beautiful features that are present.
One thing I wanted to point out before we take a closer look at the object is that we actually take a number of samples of everything that we remove from each object and that includes the soil from the cells and it also includes things like corrosion products possible organic materials and if we do happen to find any tiny garnet fragments in the soil.
So all those things are saved and I constructed this little housing so they don't rattle around.
Just as an example this is the soil from the bottom and the left cloisonné cells in the object.
"Okay, can you just turn that round for us so we can just see the soil moving in there?"
"Okay, so that's an example of all the soil that you've kept."
And you were saying other things that you might of kept are just small fragments?
Any tiny fragments that I discovered that are unusual or notable in any way so for an example this is sort of a green black lump that's a compressed possible corrosion product that I found in the cells.
This is an interesting feature that I thought I would point out this is one thing that I found through excavating one of the central cells here and that's a remaining rivet.
There are actually several rivet holes present and you can see those on the back of the object
The system is off its rocker.
"To conclude, some food for thought."
"First, for the Zande, there's a no concept of absolute evil."
There's no abstract evil force or double.
There are only humans who do evil things.
Evil happens.
Rather than exists.
It happens in witchcraft carried out by neighbors and even family members.
"Neighbors aren't evil in and of themselves, usually your buddies."
"But once their witchcraft heats up, evil things can happen."
"Second, witchcraft is a total system."
"The belief in witchcraft not only explains why bad things happen, but it offers a possibility for families to fight for the health of their loved ones."
"Furthermore, because of their belief in witchcraft, the Zande do their best not to upset their neighbors and not to outdo their neighbors."
"And finally, people who believe in witchcraft are not like aliens from outer space."
"Their rational, intelligent people just like us who do their best and their particular cultural, social, historical, and environmental context to find meaning in their world."
Franz Boas has said that tradition late shackles upon all of us.
"People who grow up in Zande Land, such as these children, are as unaware of the shackles of their traditions as people growing up in the American Midwest."
"If everyone around us is wearing the same shackles, it's hard to see them."
"I think the world would be a safer, more livable place if we recognize the shackles that tradition has laid upon us, and that can lead us to believe that our worldview is the only bright one."
"For then, we'd be able to respect the validity and the beauty of other belief systems, including witchcraft."
Thank you very much.

Beth:
We're looking at a lovely little Friedrich in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin called Woman at a Window.
"Like so many of Friedrich's paintings, we see a single figure from behind."
Steven:
This is his wife and his studio in Dresden.
"We see her back, but we don't stay there."
"Instead, somehow we begin to imagine what she sees as she looks out this window."
Beth:
We imagine her life in what seems like a rather constricted environment and this really rather small view of the outside world.
This experience allows us to take the concepts we've learned and put them to work in the practical world.
At the end of the class we collaborate with Damon Lee's Film Scoring class to create a music score that fits the style and tone of our film.
This class was a great opportunity to learn the art of film-making and come out with a work of my own.

Glamour Lighting Setups
Catalogue Photo Biz Part 2
"Hey fellow photographer, how's it going?"
I'm Michael Zelbel.
Welcome to Glamour Lighting Setups.
"Even though, today's setup is actually not so glamorous after all."
We don't even have a model.
What we have is two mannequins.
And those are not even my mannequins.
"I just borrowed them from a fashion designer in the neighbourhood, who was kind enough to give them to me for a little fashion catalogue shoot, that I did for another client."
I used that last time as an example in another video of mine in which I explained to you how I think that such a catalogue shoot is so much easier for us amateurs in case we want to earn some money with photography so much easier than let's say wedding photography or let's say microstock photography.
"If you didn't watch that video please go back, watch it right now, but what you won't find in that video is explanation of the lighting setup."
"But you told me that you want to have this explanation, so today I'm doing the video with the lighting setup."
"What you want to do if you want to do such photos really really good is: you want to enable the viewer of your photos the reader of the catalogue or the user on the website wherever your photos are, you want to enable them to really feel the fabric."
You want to bring across the fabric and the three dimensionality of the garmet and what you also want is clear separation from the background.
Ideally the background is 100% white.
But be careful!
"If you too overexpose the background, then you easily get lensflare, and that really reduces the quality of the image."
So look carefully when you are shooting.
I will now show you the basic setup.
"What I used was a big white sweep, a paper backdrop, but you could also use a white wall."
Just make sure nothing in the room is really colored and could throw a color cast onto your clothes.
"And as the internet grew to encompass millions around the world, a new problem emerged."
"At the time, encryption required two parties to first share a secret random number, known as a key."
"So how could two people who have never met agree on a secret shared key without letting Eve, who's always listening, also obtain a copy?"
"In 1976, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman devised an amazing trick to do this."
"First, let's explore how this trick is done using colours."
How could Alice and Bob agree on a secret colour without Eve finding it out?
The trick is based on two facts:
"One, it's easy to mix two colours together to make a third colour, and Two, given a mixed colour it's hard to reverse it in order to find the exact original colors."
"This is the basis for a lock, easy in one direction, hard in the reverse direction."
This is known as a one-way function.
Now the solution works as follows:
"First, they agreed publicly on a starting colour, say yellow."
"Next, Alice and Bob both randomly select private colours, and mixed them into the public yellow, in order to disguise their private colours."
"Now, Alice keeps her private colour, and sends her mixture to Bob, and Bob keeps his private colour, and sends his mixture to Alice."
"Now, the heart of the trick."
"Alice and Bob add their private colours to the other person's mixture, and arrived at a shared secret colour."
"Notice how Eve is unable to determine this exact colour, since she needs one of their private colours to do so."
And that is the trick.
"Now, to do this with numbers, we need a numerical procedure which is easy in one direction and hard in the other."
"This brings us to modular arithmetic, also known as clock arithmetic."
"For example, to find ""46 mod 12"", we could take a rope of length 46 units, and wrap it around a clock of 12 units, which is called the modulus, and where the rope ends is the solution."
"So we say ""46 mod 12"" is congruent to 10."
Easy.
"Now, to make this work, we use a prime modulus, such as 17 then we find a primitive root of 17."
"In this case, 3, which has this important property that when raised to different exponents, the solution distributes to uniformly around the clock."
3 is known as the generator.
"If we raised 3 to any exponent X, then the solution is equally likely to be any integer between 0 and 17."
"Now, the reverse procedure is hard."
"Say given 12, find the exponent 3 needs to be raised to."
This is called the discrete logarithm problem.
And now we have our one-way function.
"Easy to perform, but hard to reverse."
"For example, sending them overseas so they can rest their bodies, and sending them to sanatoriums."
"In case of Fukushima, the current radiation level is so high I'm afraid such measures may not be enough."
"After all, they have eaten produce from local sources."
"Fukushima is ""Forbidden Forest"" of Belarus, so to speak."
Forest so dangerous no one can enter.
"Still, many people including children are allowed to live in the ""Forest."" I cannot permit this."
And such unusual changes in health do not happen in Fukushima alone.
I think this issue should be addressed in a more comprehensive manner.
"Indeed, there are many areas with high radiation in Kanto where children should be evacuated out."
"In Belarus, in the areas where the radiation level simply exceeds 0.1 microsievert, children did get ill, though you can't simply compare those areas to Kanto because they're self-sufficient."
But there are actually people in Kanto who claim to have nosebleed and diarrhea.
"As Dr. Hida [expert in internal radiation exposure] pointed out, if you see both nosebleed and diarrhea, that's a clear sign of internal radiation exposure."
I think it's OK for us to be overly nervous.
The most important thing we need to do now is to protect children.
It's better to overreact now and be criticized for the overreaction later than not doing anything.
"As we have seen today, various problems are happening one after another."
Those who can escape should do so.
And we have to remember the importance of keeping a record if any unusual change in health happens to us.
"Ms. Noro, thank you very much."
We will end our program with the forecast of the dispersion of radioactive particles by the German Weather Services over the next three days.
Please watch out for the weather and the wind direction when you go out during this weekend.
On the ninty-sixth day we sailed again.
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
When a bloody great Yankee hove in sight
With our cracked four-pounders we made to fight.
Goddamn them all!
"I was told we'd cruise the seas for American gold, we'd fire no guns, shed no tears..."
Now I'm a broken man on a Halifax pier the last of Barrett's privateers.
The Yankee lay low down with gold
How I wish I was in Sherbrooke now!
She was broad and fat and loose in the stays but to catch her took the Antelope two whole days.
Goddamn them all!
I hope you try them all and enjoy them. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Thank you, Hugo."
"Now, you know, what we've talked about is we've talked about the importance of mobile, and we've also talked about the mobile--the importance of the connection with the super computer."
We've not talked about much about entertainment and YouTube and so forth.
"But we, in fact, do want to talk a little bit about Google Television. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:"
"Yes, of course, we've saved the best for last."
"So with no further ado, I'd"
"like you to welcome my colleague from the Google TV team, Brittany Bohnet. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BOHNET:"
Thank you.
So you would never want to buy a computer without an Internet browser.
"In these days, especially after that demo, you'd probably never want to buy a mobile phone without an Internet browser."
"Soon, you're never going to want to buy a TV without an"
Internet browser.
And I'm here today to show you a few examples of what's possible when you have an Internet browser on TV.
"First, a few notes before I get started."
I want you to understand the context here.
Google TV is launching this fall in the US only.
"And while we're very excited to bring Google TV over to places like Europe, unfortunately, we don't have anything specific to announce at this time."
So consider this a sneak preview.
"Now, I'm actually not demoing on any of the final hardware today."
You see here a dish satellite box that I'm using to control my DVR recordings in the presentation.
The box on top of it is a generic development box that we're testing the Google TV software on right now.
I'm even using a random wired keyboard that I picked up at an electronic store a few days ago.
"It has full QWERTY keyboard functionalities, a pointing device and some"
TV specific buttons.
"Now, when we come to market in the US this fall, we'll be launching with three devices from Sony and Logitech."
"Sony is launching a Google TV powered HDTV, as well as a Google TV powered Blu-ray player."
Logitech is launching a Google TV powered box that connects to the TV you already have.
"Now, both of these OEMs are going to be building incredible remote controls that you can use with the TV."
"However, you can also use your"
"Android phone or iPhone as a remote control as well, and, yes, you may be able to do some of these incredible voice commands, that Hugo just demonstrated, on your TV."
Can you imagine searching for a channel name and watching your TV tuned to the channel?
"""You have a serious hearing problem"",  she tells me."
"""You have a serious invasive problem"",  I tell her"
"""When I talk to you,  you don't listen..."""
"""When I'm focused in my work you talk to me and I don't know whether you're talking to me  or you're just talking!"""
"And then began the crossed accusations, you, you ,you."
"Now, how would it be  if instead of this accusations of speaking in second person, we could  reverse it and talk in first person?"
"This is how I see it,  maybe I am wrong but it is what I believe."
"How would it be if instead of  always trying to dominate, we could look into what is happening?"
What do you need?
What do we have to talk about?
"And, how would it be if instead  of trying to always impose ourselves, we could propose."
"Making it neither your opinion nor mine, but finding a creative way  of making it ""our"" opinion, right?"
What we're talking about is a misterious art.
The art of handling filters.
And it has at least three parts.
"The first,  is to recognise that I have my filters, it has to do with me, it is a biased sight of a much wider reallity, from where humility emerges."
"On the other hand,  recognising that you have your filters too and you also have a biased sight  of a much wider reallity and maybe even you have some information  that can be useful for me and that is where respect appears."
"And finally taking your filters and mine and construct a bigger filter,  which is more useful, more complete, more valuable."
There is where collaboration appears.
"How are our relationships seen  when they are based in values such as humility,  respect and collaboration?"
"Taking this into my example, with humility,  the matter would be of recognising that, okay, it is true that I have  an irritating capability sometimes to isolate from the exterior world, I respect the fact that it bothers you, as well as I ask you to listen  to the needs I have."
"Lets collaborate together  and find an option, when you want to tell me something,  ring the bell, text me, wait, clap your hands, or hit the cymbals."
"And tomorrow at the end  of the school day, I will willingly pick-up the kids, sit them in the park and we'll make balls of glue and we'll take them to the 24/7 guy across the peninsula of Yucatán."
(Aplause)
You ever been to Miami Beach?
Yes.
With a girl?
Yes.
Particular girl?
"Particular, yes, but she didn't carry a gun."
I've heard about those nights down there.
"They're warm, very warm."
I stared at white ceilings for good  eight years before the fMRI was developed.
"In the process of that, there was  no pain management in Toronto area."
And there was tremendous suffering in my body.
That one body could produce so much suffering was an amazing thing to me.
"You have a choice in that kind of suffering about whether you are going to stay alive, go mad or do something different with it."
So I decided that what I do  is to study about suffering.
I were a case of one and  I had lots of academic work that I could do every single minute of every day.
"So, rather than the fight-flight-faint kind of approach that people often have to stress,"
"I, in fact, step in with the stress,  held it as one that holds a child  or a brand new puppy. and started to look how it changed me and made me."
I appreciated every moment.
I was like a snail walking on a razor's edge.
Every single move hurt.
"When it finally got to the point that  scientists developed enough knowledge to know what is going on with me,  they asked me how I was injured, how I not going mad,  and I was able to say,"
"I am in the process of it,  studying suffering."
I took my pain and I tried  to shift it around a little bit.
"I use my mind inside myself to try and see whether there was a place  where there was no pain, whether there was an empty spot."
So I have to say that the practice of mindful meditation  came to me through a drunk driver.
And I am deeply appreciative for him  and all he has done.
"When I started walking again,  in my mid 30s, they asked me what is it  I wanted to do."
All I had was a tremendous degree in suffering.
(Laughter)
So I took that and  I went into Palliative Care.
There are some people here today  who remember my work in Palliative Care.
"I would speak about how the kind  of work that we do with the dying, which was pharma care, grief and  bereavement, was wholly inadequate."
That this is an experience in life that is so profound that we need to be able to work  with it differently.
So I started using mindfulness meditation in Palliative Care and got results that  are absolutely remarkable.
I became a teacher in Palliative Care.
"I am a theologian and a social worker but I work in Faculty of Medicine  and Faculty of Social Work, also Bio-Ethics in the Dalai Lama's  School of Public Health."
And I tried very hard to start  to bring changes in the system and we succeeded for a while.
"Then finally I left at the age of 55 and at about 6 weeks' mark into my retirement, the University of Toronto phoned and said, ""Would you come and teach mindfulness meditation course, just one or two courses?"""
"I thought I was kind of smart, I said, ""Yeah, I can do that with my eyes closed."""
"And he didn't get the joke, but I thought  I was being brilliant."
We want to have debates on these programs that really matter to people and improve their lives.
"I think you guys have a very good case to be made about the work that you do, and that's what we want to keep very focused, very positive on."
"And however the process works, if it doesn't it doesn't, but you know, the main point is keeping up what you're doing, telling the story of the good work that you're doing, to encourage support amongst those who might not be supporters currently or new members who might not know about the program and also to encourage long-standing supporters who after all are still there doing great work."
I think those are very important things for you all to be doing.
Brad:
"Well, Elyse, thank you very much for that answer, and coming to the regular order, it was very impressive work of Senators Reed and Collins in getting 34 Senators to go on the letter to the Secretary of Energy on the reallocation in FY ""13, and we're hearing fairly soon, Elyse, from DOE."
We hope to have good news to share on that.
Elyse:
I think they had a fairly short time frame of figuring these issues out.
"The fiscal year is winding down to it almost, September."
"We are hopeful that we've made a good case, and we are certainly joined by large numbers."
I think I heard there is a similar letter effort in the House.
Brad:
Yes.
"With a number of Republicans, and that's very encouraging."
Elyse:
Yes I think those kinds of efforts really help bolster our efforts here.
We'll have to see.
We want to have a robust program.
We want there to be a program in every state.
"I think that only helps us going forward, and as we fight for FY ""14 appropriations."
Brad:
"And turning to that, we have 225 people, Elyse, listening to the Webinar."
"Let's talk for a minute about the ""14 process."
"We just want to ask folks to engage on the letter that I mentioned for the reallocation for FY ""13."
So now we're turning to a situation where we will both have outside groups like
NASCSP and other stake holders submitting testimony by May 9th as we've already done in the House.
Is April 29th the Deadline?
Elyse:
"I think we've heard April 26th, and that's a Friday."
"The reason they might have chosen that day is on many subcommittees that's the last day of this work period, and the week of the 29th is a recess."
"So I think that's why many of them chose the 26th, but I should double-check my dates."
"I, I can do it and you can't right?"
Well yes but we've still made you.
Oh no that's foolish.
"To make a long story short, actually it's not a very long story but it's a delightful one."
"The robot is utterly convinced that, it is"
God's creation.
"And its, highest commandment is to keep that beam aimed at a particular spot on the surface of Earth."
And these poor humans are simply mistaken about that.
And there's no convincing the robot that they are right.
"The humans finally decide, you know."
"It may not be that the robot understands it's own origins, but it makes no difference because it will obey that commandment and so they leave."
"In other words, the robots have to know what is right for people and do it absolutely, even if they completely misunderstand what the human beings want, say and do."
"This is a fairy tale, okay?"
How can anybody know what's good and right automatically and always.
No one can.
"How could robots, therefore, be able to?"
Can they read our minds?
"Well, that's not posited, but they have positronic brains."
"As one reads through the stories in I, Robot, one goes from the beginning where you just have a robot nanny to, who was selfless, of course, in the care of her charge."
Its charge?
The young child.
"All the way through to the last couple of stories in which the main character we need to confront, who's new, is Steven"
"Bierley, the world administrator."
"The whole world, in other words."
On the basis of having robots to do good and provide the wherewithal is moving ever more toward a utopia.
"As you read the whole book, if you think of it not as separate stories but as a composite novel, the ending would have to be utopian."
"Of course, if you read the story separately that wouldn't follow."
"And the very last story, the evitable conflict, that is we can get rid of conflict."
The evitable conflict is one which Steven Briarly is having a colloquy with a character named Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin is a robopsychologist and she has been a continuing character referenced though out the book and interstial parts between the separately published earlier stories as a [unknown] was created to bind the whole into one work all feature Susan Calvin.
Susan Calvin trains the technicians Donovan and Powell who go around setting up the robots.
Susan Calvin is an advisor to US Robotics the industrial firm that makes things.
"Then, we have cluster computing, which is, the common thing is, like Google, gigantic warehouse, and buys a 100,000 of the same computer, and puts it altogether, and houses it altogether, and that's called a cluster."
And all the computers work together to do whatever you need them to.
"Cool? side note, personally, this isn't on Dan's lectures, this is mine. my definition cloud computing."
"Google has its own cluster, its own cluster of machines, but they don't always use all these computers."
"Sometimes, a lot of them are idle like in Christmas break, people are searching more, so they need more machines, but over the summer that people are searching less they still have the machines."
"So, what do they do with them?"
"Well, came out the idea of the cloud that you can rent out these computers for whatever services other people need."
And it's just opens up a world of possibilities.
"The ideas that because these computers are for you to use, you get to them over the internet, and you can get to them over the internet from your phone, computer,"
"laptop, anywhere anytime."
"And this just opens the possibilities everywhere, but it's not actually that much of a new technology."
"It's just like, oh, a new way to use the Internet and the computer we already have."
"It's pretty cool, but it's just very applicable and really nice."
Awesome.
"So, the five parts of the computer."
[INAUDlBLE] is tower.
A computers are usually split into five parts.
"The first being the processor, which has the control, the brain which actually does the work and the datapath which shares the wires that connects the different part of the brain."
"And, then there's the memory, which is the storage, both long term, short term, anything."
"Registers, caches, hard drive, whatever you can think is part of the memory."
"And then, there are the devices, the inputs and outputs."
"Keyboard, mouse, monitor, whatever you need."
"This is called, well, we'll get to that in a moment."
This is called the Von Neumann
Architecture.
"And you should know John von Neumann, I believe in the 60's, he came up with this architecture and he's a famous guy."
"John von Neumann came up with this architecture and is still used today, decaed and daecades later, and he's pretty famous."
You should know him.
He maybe tested on.
Awesome.
So what's inside the processor? we're back on hopefully.
"There is the processor, brain and datapath."
And you might want to connect with others to do further explorations around some of those ideas.
And do you want to add to that Natalie?
Natalie:
"Well just that Fred also had something online, something that he shared some failures of the past and the class inspired him to go back and try it again."
So if theres something that you had tried before and put aside but you want to pull it out of that file cabinet and try another version.
"Or that someone did out in the community, they were recalling some amazing project they had done in a housing project."
And if that can inspire other people.
So either with other people or your own project.
Mitch:
"I think its very much in the spirit of learning spiral that we introduced right in the beginning of class, this idea of continually iterating."
"And week to week we aren't giving you so much time to iterate so the diving deeper really gives you an opportunity to iterate on some of the things you got started with, some of the weekly assignments or readings or discussions."
So hopefully you'll get a chance to get started on that over the next few weeks along with doing some of the readings about tinkering and doing your own tinkering with some of the suggested activities.
And then we'll come back three weeks from now on April 29th to explore more fully the idea of tinkering in the next session of Learning Creative Learning.
Thanks a lot.
Natalie:
Bye Mitch:
"Bye, bye."
"But now it's Bach, so I won't confuse you."
That was only a snippet of Chaconne by Bach.
A song I play at many classical concerts.
What music do you actually listen to?
Melodious.
What does that mean?
That every genre in the world is a gift from God.
It's just not that everyone are good representatives of it.
"When you listen to rap, for example, then you  most likely listen to Eminem or ""Klovner i kamp"" because when good rap exists why listen to bad rap?"
When you listen to country you listen to Willie Nelson.
"It's, of course, everyone is allowed to try but it would be better if there only were good examples for every genre."
"So there would not be criticism like ""Oh, you're stupid because you listen to rock"""
What do you put highest of all Norwegian music?
You once said you'd like to play Ole Bull.
"Well, yeah, you just answered the question."
How we experienced it.
"The first international perception of the 15M was on the 18th or 19th, I can't remember the dates when we got a message from Egypt through a co-worker at Periodismo Humano, Olga Rodríguez."
It was from the revolutionary commission of Egypt- that's not the right name but you understand- supporting what was happening in Sol.
I remember talking to Olga about publishing it but we had to talk to the people in the Puerta del Sol first.
So they knew they had support.
ST:
"There was a problem with one of the words in that, wasn't there?"
JL:
"Yes, in the message we got from Egypt supporting the 15M, in the headline they wrote of their support to Democracia Real Ya."
"So of course, they were already talking about whether Democracia Real Ya was part of the camp, who was who... it was all very sensitive."
And I remember asking Olga if she knew who was who.
"So we explained it to them and they said OK, let's make it as broad as possible, and they changed the message and made it extensive to all the 15M."
"We didn't consider ourselves the writers of the message, we simply asked what they meant and we advised them a little about what it was all about."
"It was all so incipient, there were so many debates, it was logical that something like that should happen."
That was the first international perception we had.
"Parallel to that, you spend 12 or 15 hours in a doorway telling stories, trying to find the humane side to things, working on reports..."
"In all, doing high quality journalism and suddenly you go up to a roof on the 17th, and the man there wants to charge you for taking a photo from the balcony and you give it little importance saying it's just a mobile, and you go to the balcony and make a 40 second video."
"You publish it on the internet, because there's 3G coverage up there, and after you put it on youtube it becomes the most seen video of the month in the political news category."
And in a few hours you have hundred of thousands of reproductions.
And suddenly they tell me that the video's on the website of the New York Times.
And then in the Washington Post.
"And on BoingBoing, one of the most read blogs in English in the world."
And then more media.
And front pages... it's something...
"We were the first source of information on the 15M for the New York Times and the Washington Post, the first text they produced was a photo of mine of a woman with a non-violence sign, and the panoramic video taken from the balcony with Paz Vega in the background."
"Paz Vega, the involuntary muse of the 15M."
ST:
We shamelessly took advantage of her.
JL:
"That was the second great reaction we noticed, or that I noticed personally."
"From there on, there were radios from France, from Chile, Argentina, Miami..."
Articles in Al Jazeera.
"Masking tape helps protect your car, your buffing pads, and, of course, makes it easier to clean up at the end of the day."
"Now that everything is taped off, it's time to get to work."
Work in two-by-two areas and complete the rest of the car.
"Now that we've compounded, polished and jeweled the paint, the next step is to seal it."
"Apply paint sealant one panel at a time, then remove with a microfiber towel until every painted surface is covered."
"Once cured, the sealant will protect your freshly restored paint and help hide any scratches that were just too deep to safely repair during the correction stage."
"Now we've sealed the car so it looks spectacular, and it's protected."
"Now, if remember back in the previous episodes, we talked about putting Carnauba wax on top, and that's exactly what"
I'm going to do.
"That's going to bring in a pop, that shine back to this paint."
So let's get started.
"The trick here is to add a light, thin layer of Carnauba wax on top of the cured sealant."
"It's possible to do two or three panels before removing the wax with a clean microfiber towel, and the car should take no more than 15 to 20 minutes to get insane depth and shine."
"Although the Porsche took about eight hours or so from start to finish, it was totally worth it."
"Remember, we started off with paint that was completely neglected and in need of some serious correction."
"And after a bit of testing, we managed to restore the paint to near perfection with a safe and easy-to-use machine."
"All right, guys."
"Well, we finally finished this beautiful Porsche Speedster."
"Now, the one thing that we've learned is that you need the right tools."
"You need the right techniques, and a little bit of patience."
"And you, too, can have your car look as amazing as this."
"Now remember, download your free PDF and product guide at ammonyc.com."
"If you have additional questions, shoot me an email or visit my blog for other how-to videos."
"Well, that's it for you guys."
Thanks for watch another episode of Drive Clean right here on the Drive Channel.

"A bit overwhelmed and actually humbled, with all the faces I see out here today."
You represent a lot of great memories from my family and I.
So stick with me as I kind of fumble through the next few minutes.
"Writing has always been a form of therapy for me,"
"So, today, I welcome you to the congregation of voices that reside in my head."
Might be a scary thought.
"And died a week after,  because of a respiratory arrest."
"You can imagine that  the TEDx event, last year, was like a limbo to me."
I went on autopilot.
"I have mental images of that day, but actually I have no emotional  recollection of what happened."
There was one person in charge of filming  everything that went on that day and creating a video with  the highlights of the event.
"For some reason, it took him a whole  year to deliver this video and... as we were getting close  to the first anniversary my idea was to dedicate  this video to my Mom."
But the video was no good.
It did not convey any message.
"It had been done in a hurry -- it felt like a mere mix  of random scenes from that day, and -- did nothing to communicate what  the event was really all about."
"It wasn't that the person who did it  lacked the talent,"
-- he had plenty --  The thing was that he didn't put enough effort  in the making.
It hadn't been done the way
"I like things to be done,  wholeheartedly."
"And so, I could not dedicate  the video to my Mom."
"And what really caught  my attention from all this, was that the editor  took offense for my remarks."
Which got me thinking:
"What is to get offended if not a way to hide from  our own vulnerabilities, to avoid what we  don't want to hear?"
And do so to avoid what  we do not want to hear and to find excuses not to do  things the way we should.
So that's why I'm here  today talking to you:
Because I could not dedicate  that video to her.
And I decided to dedicate  this talk to her.
But it' turns out that this talk  was close to never happen.
"Three weeks ago, an oil spill in General Paz Avenue, almost got me to meet  my Mom right away -- (Laughter)"
"But thanks to a guardrail  that decided not to give in and spared me a twenty meter fall y a que por una enorme casualidad en la General Paz and the unlikely miracle  of finding no other car in 100 meter radius [330 feet], at the time of the crash, is that I'm now standing  here with you."
This talk that might have been about a great idea of a project I intended  to develop in Rosario became what it is right now.
Because I realized that I could've left  this world with a lot of unsaid stuff.
"For instance,  I wanted to tell that this year I was visited  by three women."
"Firstly, to remind me  that everything I do has to be done wholeheartedly."
"Secondly, to show me  the importance of being vulnerable  in front of other people, and the intimate relation  between vulnerability and doing things wholeheartedly."
"The third person, who apart  from all of you now, was the only one on Earth  who had heard me speak about my feelings, taught me that in order to do things right  I must learn to trust."
Trust in my own sensitivity.
"Trust others, who are dealing  with issues and fears of their own."
"As you can see at the bottom, there is the chip."
I'm sorry.
"The middle is the chip, the bottom is in the package."
"It's usually the size of a quarter, which is not too big, sometimes smaller even."
And this does all the work in your computer.
Some key terms that you don't need to know are feature size.
Feature size is the distance between two consecutive wires in the CPU.
"In this case, this computer has feature size of 45 nanometers."
That's so small that it's way too close.
"And nowadays, I believe they have a 22 and maybe sixteen coming up soon."
"Who? other things you need to know about this, that the CPUs have hundreds of thousands if not millions of transistors on them so that they could do all the computation really fast."
"And they have a multiple layers, so just"
looking at the top doesn't make much difference.
That's basically it.
One of the biggest topics when you learn
"Computer Science and when you do research in work in the development is Moore's Law, and, if you take anything away from this lecture, it should be Moore's Law."
"And Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on your chip is doubled about every two years, actually every eighteen months."
"What's Moore did, sorry, Moore is the [INAUDlBLE]."
"What Moore did was that he plotted the computers before his time for like two years and he said, you know, this has been happening so far and I'm going to predict that it's going to happen in the future and so far it has."
"As you can see in the slide, you can see a really nice straight line in a linear-log curve."
"It's a line in a linear-log curve, as you, go along it multiplies by two as every increment."
"Again, Moore's Law is super important that the transistors of a chip are multiplied by two and then they're twice as small every eighteen months."
Awesome.
A very common mistake about Moore's Law is thinking that a lot of exponential growth in computers are also relevant to Moore's Law and that's not true.
"So, here are, are a few."
"Moore's Law only talks about transistors, the top graph, And you can see that over the years, say, you can see more data points that it's held true."
Other things that have also held true is the power consumption How much power you take?
And that has basically doubled over time.
"So has the frequency, how fast your computer runs, the clocksped."
"What happens to this computers, go, have steps and every time the clock changes, they take another step."
"And as you raise the clockspeed, you make the computer faster and that has gone up."
"And the single thread performance, the speed of the computer doing one thing has also increases exponentially."
That's why we try to reduce our footprint.
Maybe you know this joke;
"One planet meets another planet, and says, ""You really look terrible today""."
"And the other planet says, ""Yes, I have Homo sapiens""."
"The first planet answers,"
"""Don't worry, I had this before;  it will disappear somehow""."
"We feel so bad, we think it's better we are not here."
"With all these environmental disasters, we lost a whole generation of good scientists."
"We have lots of smart MBA's, we have brilliant lawyers, but we don't have enough engineers."
"We don't have enough good scientists because how can you study chemistry, when you see Bhopal?"
"How can you study physics, when you see Chernobyl?"
And the one who studies to be a scientist did with a bad conscience..
"So that's why they try to be ""less bad""."
He apologizes everyday for being here.
That's the reasons that we're trying to minimize our footprint.
"We walk, and when we are in Sweden, for example, your footprint means destruction, that's why people try to minimize their footprint."
"But, when you are here, your footprint means the water stays longer."
"So why do we want to minimize our footprint, when we can have a beneficial footprint?"
So we can make things completely differently.
But this is what we do.
"Here, it stinks, this is PVC."
Never designed to go in biological systems.
"This is our catalog, it stinks; never designed for toilet paper."
It's hazardous waste.
"We need to reinvent our products, and the products need to look different, completely different."
"Everything that gets consumed; food, detergents, backpacks, need to be designed to grow up into biological systems."
Everything that is just used as a service needs to go back to the technical system.
"You cannot consume a window, you don't consume a washing machine, you don't consume a TV set, you only use it."
"So, we need to distinguish between two different cycles."
"Things which get consumed, like shoe soles, need to be designed to go to biological systems."
"Things which are just used, like the washing machine, need to be designed for the technical cycle, but right now,  they are just hazardous waste."
"So, we need to reinvent our products, completely from the beginning."
"Still, I think it's important to go to the hospital and get the diagnosis, for a record."
"Ah, for a record."
Right.
"Even if you think the diagnosis is off the mark, the fact that it's off the mark may later serve as an evidence of some kind."
The diagnosis can prove that a symptom similar to it did happen to you.
So I think you should go to the hospital.
I see.
But I hear many mothers have had bad experiences with doctors.
That's true.
"I know doctors have said various things to mothers, such as ""overreacting,"" ""too nervous,"" or ""that may be pollen allergy."""
But this is something Japanese doctors should learn as well from now on.
"We, too, often had bad experiences with doctors in Chernobyl."
"When they hear the words ""radiation exposure,"" they only think of cancers or leukemia."
"However, the health problems of children living in the contaminated areas are relatively minor and cannot be diagnosed."
"They have a whole range of such symptoms, which is called ""a bouquet of symptoms."""
The Japanese doctors who went to Chernobyl as part of the relief effort didn't examine such children.
They only treated children with more serious diseases.
"But you know, the children who got cancer is just the tip of an iceberg."
"Under the tip, there are innumerable children who have such minor symptoms as, say, fatigue."
Fatigue is a typical symptom of thyroid disorder.
Or eye swelling.
I frequently heard from mothers their children suffered from eye swelling after they fell in the contaminated places.
I hear there's a similar case recently.
Yes.
I often hear the story of how children fell in a sandpit with high radiation and their eyes get swollen the next day.
Sometimes swollen in purple.
"Also, quite a few people claim that bruises have appeared, or that moles have appeared or disappeared, which seem to have nothing to do with stress or physical conditions."
Some women claim the menstrual period has stopped or the menstrual cycle is irregular.
Others are saying their allergy has gotten worse.
Or their diseases have recurred.
These are the symptoms I noticed when looking at the emails.
"Another problem right now is people are eating contaminated food, because the Japanese radiation safety limit for food was raised."
"Fincher would always say, ""It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."""
"And thing our process and the technology couldn't do, is they couldn't understand intent, the intent of the actor."
So it sees a smile as a smile.
"It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile, or a frustrated smile."
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
"But we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology ""emotion capture,"" as opposed to just motion capture."
Take another look.
Brad Pitt:
"Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper, and they said I was gonna die soon, but ... maybe not."
EU:
That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.
(Applause)
"A couple of quick factoids; it really took 155 people over two years, and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut."
"But, that is Benjamin."
Thank you.
[Norvig]
A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school; the kids are learning how to grow food.
"Promoting recycling, things like garden-share, that matches up people who don't have a garden who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore."
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies.
"This is Lewes in Sussex, who have recently launched the Lewes Pound, a currency that you can only spend within the town, as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy."
"You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything."
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively.
"Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan, which is basically to develop a plan B for the town."
"Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community, still start by assuming that there will be more energy, more cars, more housing, more jobs, more growth, and so on."
What does it look like if that's not the case?
And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody?
"As a friend of mine says, ""Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."""
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
"From three years ago, it just being an idea, this has become something that has virally swept around the world."
We're getting a lot of interest from government.
Congratulations.
You've finally gotten through the discussion about the different parameters and the desired Googlebot behavior.
And now you can go back to your site and repeat this process for the different parameters that you have.
You don't have to do this for every single parameter.
"But just including a few, and specifying the right Googlebot behavior can really help with your crawl efficiency."
We're almost done.
But you might be asking one last question.
"Which is, ""What about multiple parameters in one URL?"" For example, ""sku equals 234 page equals three and sort by equals price"" etcetera."
How does URL parameters work when there are multiple parameter settings?
The answer is to remember that URL parameters is about crawling your site more efficiently.
So you can imagine that all URLs that we know about for your site.
"So if you're the Google store, all 380,000 URLS begin as eligible for crawling."
And then we work as a process of elimination.
Not inclusion.
So we take our knowledge of your site.
Combined by each of your settings in URL parameters to slowly weed away the URLs that shouldn't be crawled.
"Until at the very end, we have a smaller subset of good URLs."
To recap.
"If you're now more comfortable with the URL Parameters, please utilize this feature for more efficient crawling of your site."
You can start with specifying the parameters that do not change page content.
Those should be easier to do.
"And then after you have done that step, the next step is to specify parameters that change the page content."
"And remember, if you can't determine, don't guess."
"Please ""let Googlebot decide."""
"One more time, the sorts parameter."
"If the sorts parameter for your site never exists in a URL by default, then ""Crawl No URLs."""
"Or if site-wide, the same sort value is always used, then ""Crawl URLs with value x."" For ""Narrows"" if your ""narrows"" parameter causes non-useful filtering for searchers, like size or price, then you might select ""Crawl No"
"URLs."" Just be sure to double-check that none of your important pages will be affected."
"For ""specifies"" it's usually ""Crawl Every URL."" And the same applies to ""Translates"" and ""Paginates."""
Yay!
I think we've covered a lot of information about URL parameters.
Here are links to more resources if you want further help.
"There's some science behind it, but it's within a range of what we have historically done."
"We have looked at other properties that have a lot of page views, and much of the social networking things, for example."
And they don't monetize that well.
And they don't monetize nearly as well as text search.
"So we're unlikely to do major changes there, although we're trying a few things."
"The next--another way of asking your question is, where is the next source of revenue?"
"And the next source of revenue is the current business functioning better with better conversion, more traffic, more advertisers, which is our core business."
"The next, and adjacent, business, is a set of display businesses and an exchange that are being built as a consequence of the Double Click acquisition."
The display business is as large as the text search business.
It's relatively balkanized??
(30:39).
It's not a uniform in any particular way.
"The systems are complicated, the way the display ads are managed, is done, in many cases, by hand or by poor quality spreadsheets."
"So we see an opportunity to apply the Google magic, you know, the measurement and the scaling, in that business."
And that's probably the next big one. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Any other questions?
"Yep, right here."
We'll move beyond the first three rows at some point. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thank you.
I wanted to get your thoughts on Twitter.
"There's been a lot of discussion there that potentially it evolves as a real time search engine, and in an un-Google-like way, you haven't really responded with any sort of application or product there, outside of, maybe, Blogger."
How do you foresee that product in the next few years?
And is that a potential or a threat for Google? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
We're in favor of all of these new communications mechanisms.
Google just put up a Google Twitter site.
Google can tweet to you.
It's called At Google.
And so you can go ahead and listen to our ruminations as to where we are and what we're doing in 160 characters or
less.
"Speaking as a computer scientist, I view all of these as, sort of, poor man's email systems."
"In other words, they have aspects of an email system, but they don't have a full offering."
"So, to me the question about companies like Twitter is, do they fundamentally involve as sort of â€˜note' phenomena?"
"In some sense, being aware of context -- that things look one way from one perspective, you look at it from another perspective, it can be a whole different thing."
"What ""certainty"" is, by definition, is something that is, that's SUPPOSED to make us feel very comfortable and satisfied and certain about life."
"But you've said ""certainty"" is ""counter learning."""
Yeah.
"All this search for ""certainty,"" is in some sense, again, like shooting ourselves in the foot."
I think the strategies that we've been taught about how to learn
lead to the overwhelming feeling of incompetence that so many people have.
To boredom and depression.
And in that people are searching and some of the things that they come up with as a way of explaining this I think get them into more trouble.
"The application of mindfulness extends, as you've made the point, you know, throughout life."
Let's start with children.
"You're saying that we have to start doing in our schools, we have to start teaching them to be active deciders, not passive deciders."
What's involved with that?
"Well, again, it goes back to this notion of certainty."
Most people are afraid of uncertainty.
And
I think what we have to do is learn how to exploit the power of uncertainty.
"Um, let me give you an example."
I don't know if this will be meaningful to you.
"But when I was in school, I was taught The Battle of Hastings was 1066."
"Now, that's all I know about The Battle of Hastings."
This doesn't seem to me a very important piece of information.
"You almost get the sense that people were saying, ""OK, we'd better get ready because The Battle of Hastings is about to begin."""
"Rather than realizing that somebody decided that we're going to call this ""The Battle of Hastings."""
It doesn't begin that way.
"When does a conflict become, you know, a skirmish;"
A skirmish become a conflict; a conflict become a war.
When do we want to call it a war?
"All of these labels that we have, all of our categories are given by people and it hides all the ambiguity.\"
Attentiveness:
"Most teachers, they are doing a good job, and you and you would (I would) probably concur if I was looking into their little window, into their classroom, if all the students had their hands on the desks, sitting in a straight line with rapt attention."
"Yet you said ""creative distraction"" can be helpful in the classroom."
(Applause)
"""Open Architecture Network"" is an amazing project that brings together the world's designers and architectures to collaborate and do stuff that anyone could not do."
It's a beautiful site that gets better every month.
"We had ""Pangea Day."""
James Nachtwey brought the story about TB.
"""The encyclopedia of Life"" has been built, that's a massive project that TED was part of."
"""Once Upon a School"", ""Next Einstein in Africa"", and this ""Charter for Compassion"". are just some of the ones that have been done."
"So, the kerfuffle was over, you know,"
"TED numbers started to grow, and it really started to feel like there was something good going on and the puzzle was, how could you get these ideas that were exciting people in the conference?"
Could you get them out into the world at large somehow?
"So, if you wind the clock back a bit to when I started the foundation that owns TED,"
I was really obsessed with this question: how do you make a difference?
How do you leverage money spent to really have maximum impact?
"And, I thought about these 5 things, all of which have massive amplification of human attention."
"And, then, it hit me that there was really a bigger thing that encompasses them all."
"And if you focused on that, you know, that might be the way to go."
"Think about ideas, you know, they start off as these little electrical patterns in someone's brain, you know, they weigh nothing. but they occur in the right circumstances, can spread to another brain, they can excite the body that houses that brain to do stuff, and if you're lucky, pass on the pattern to other people."
The ideas do the work for you.
That's a really amazing thing.
"And so we wondered how we could let the amazing ideas that happen at TED, which are after all the most infectious ideas I have ever seen, boy, if you could see those into the world, what might happen?"
And how to do it?
"I hired a woman, June Cohen to help me figure out the answer to this question."
"She is an experience media executive, long-term TEDster."
"And our first shot was television, you know, big audience."
We thought TED talks would look fantastic on TV.
"Unfortunately, all the TV executives we spoke to didn't see that."
We got nowhere.
"And so in 2006, we thought we do a little experiment, and just try putting a few of them up ourselves on the web, and see what happened."
We were worried that they would have none of emotional impact of the live event.
We were worried that TEDsters would be annoyed that stuff would be given away.
"But so, it was just an experiment."
"Majora Carter, Hans Rosling and Ken Robinson, these were three of the first ones we put up."
It turned out they used it for animation.
If you wanted to move something over and over again you would do it on idle.
"It worked for that generation, but when the next generation of Macintoshes came out that were faster, suddenly all the animation went crazy and didn't work very well."
"The lesson from that was: if you don't provide a right way to do something, the street will figure out its own way."
"It turns out the browser learned from that, and so we've got set interval which was a correct response to this problem."
So HyperCard had a huge impact on the evolution of the browser.
"Basically, the Netscape 2 browser was an attempt to put HyperCard functionality into the browser."
"Not surprisingly, JavaScript is well suited to this model -- not surprisingly because JavaScript was invented specifically to do this."
"In fact, it does it really well."
"So as awful as the DOM is, JavaScript with the DOM is an effective programming environment."
You can actually get stuff done.
"If you put on top of the DOM an Ajax library -- say a good one like YUI 3- it's even better, it's way better."
One of the ways we're blessed here is that JavaScript does not have READ.
"It does not ordinarily break or halt, and that's a good thing."
"It's always been seen over its lifetime as a huge deficit -- 'JavaScript is bad because it can't READ' -- but it turns out that we're actually better off for it, because it's easier for us to think about event loops than people coming from other languages."
"It turns out you can do an event loop in any language, but we're better at it in JavaScript because we've never had this two mind thing where sometimes you block and sometimes you don't."
Being in a world where you never block just makes life easier.
"READ is bad because it blocks, and blocking is bad for event loops, and that's where we live in the browser."
JavaScript programmers are just smarter about using event
"loops than programmers in other languages, it's just a fact."
You guys are just smarter.
Event loop is just one approach to concurrency.
There are lots of others.
The most popular approach today is threading.
"Everything has trade-offs, everything has pros and cons, and these are some of the pros and cons of threading."
"First off, everybody knows what threading is, right?"
I don't have to define that?
Right.
"The first pro, and it's a huge one, is that no rethinking is necessary."
"Any time you come up with something and say 'and you don't have to rethink' it's like great, sign me up."
"I'm ready to do that, I'm ready to not have to think."
All of your bad habits work just fine under threading.
He's going to drive down the price even more.
You can see it over here.
"If they increase quantity beyond this market quantity of 75, 37.5 each, if we go beyond that, the price that they would be selling at, at that quantity over there, is lower than the average total cost."
"You're going to be, the total economic, the average economic profit per unit is going to be negative."
There will be a total of negative economic profit.
Neither of them will want to produce more from this state either.
"All of a sudden in this topless state, holding others constant; if you hold A constant, B can't gain by changing his strategy, and if you hold B constant"
"A can't gain by changing his strategy, so we are, up here, in a Nash equilibrium."
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"Like the prisoner's dilemma, it was not the optimal state."
"The optimal state was here, but because they both wanted to cheat, they both wanted to do this one-upmanship, they both broke their contracts, they could end up in this state over here."
But this state is stable.
There's nothing holding the other party equal.
"There's nothing that they could do to change, to optimize."
"What they could do, and this is not what Nash applies to, they could say okay, we've been really ruining each others' business."
Let's go coordinate again and I'm going to decrease production if you decrease production.
"That is not, and they could maybe try to go back to this state, and that does not mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium because by coordinating again we're not holding the others constant."
We're saying I'm changing my strategy while you're changing your strategy.
Maybe only through another agreement they could go over here.
That still doesn't mean that this is not a Nash equilibrium.
This is a Nash equilibrium.
"If there's no coordination, if you hold one player constant, the other player cannot change their strategy, or change their production, for a gain."

We are from God and to him we return.
Put him on his back.
Cameraman:
These are the mercenaries.
"First man, out of shot:"
These are the people he is using to help him.
He's been shot in the chest.
Another man:
"They wanted to burn him, disfigure him."
(laughter)
"No, I say that jokingly, but its true."
I get a huge luxury that when I make my videos
I pretend that the students are so enthralled by what I have to say that I can just imagine it.
And what's good about that is that it gives me energy...
"It's much harder to sit in front of a room full of 30 kids and you're not sure whether some are getting it, some are there, some are here."
"What happens is that.. that energy gets conveyed in the videos and when the students watch it, they can pause and repeat as many times as they want."
I just got a letter from a kid who watched one video 30 times and it took him 30 times to get the idea.
And what he said was that there no one on the planet that he could have paid to tutor him that constant 30 times without judging him.
And I think that's what students really like.
Tom:
"You do have a non-profit, you're out there in the universe of cyberspace but are any of the educational systems in this country"
- the districts - either at the local or state level - coming to you and saying 'how can we strengthen the relationship between what we need and what you do?'
Sal:
"Yes, we started some pilots last year, just almost on a whim and its gotten pretty exciting."
"Some of the local schools in the Bay Area, they said: 'what would you do if you could do anything you wanted with a 5th grade classroom?"""
"We said that we'd have every student working at their own pace: watching videos, doing the self-paced exercises."
Only moving forward once they'd mastered concepts.
Right now you get a 'B' or a 'C' on a topic.
"That's fine, you passed, even though you don't know 10 or 20% of the material."
And then you move on to more difficult topics.
"So we are saying everyone at their on pace, master concepts first and then what happens to the teachers is that they get all of this data: who is working on what, what videos are they watching."
What exercises are they doing.
So the teacher no longer has to give these 'one size fits all' lectures.
The teacher can actually get the data and say:
"""Hey look, Tom's having trouble with negative numbers, and everyone else is working at their own pace,"
"let me sit down next to Tom and actually have a 1-1 intervention with Tom."""
What we've found in the classrooms has been pretty crazy before maybe 10% of the teacher's time was spent on that really deep 1-1 mentorship.
Now it is 90% of their time.
So what we consider to be the relevant metric which is the student-to-time-with-the-teacher ratio.
That's gone through the roof.
Tom:
"Now here, you can use their attention to see your ad and take some action."
"Of course you need the human resources, the people, the talent to do that."
- It mostly depends on brains.
You don't need to build or to invest heavily in factories.
"- It could be an area where Portugal could invest in, and make a large return, without needing a very big investment in machines."
"- From the early stages, we decided to divide the company in business teams, without departments."
"There is no department of design, or department of development, ... all that stuff."
"All the teams are businessteams that have business people and technical people together, working for the same purpose and for the same team."
"So all you see around our office, is businessteams of 12-15 people maximum, working together in a circle shape."
So everyone works together.
- We got a digital label to work with us and we'll be on a compilation that has different bands from all over the world that play garage rock.
And we were selected to represent Portugal.
- My day job is in school.
I teach Portuguese to foreign learners.
- I'm a designer ... ... of machines.
- I'm an architect.
"- Wel, when I'm not playing in a band, I like to be a photographer."
- Portuguese are people with a high degree of imagination and a high degree of flexibility.
"Both of these aspects have helped us in building a good IT system, adapting it to the needs of our customers."
"- Centre of innovation, of technology."
"It's the centre of tradition, of history, of modernity, of wonderful people. of good food, of good weather."
Everything!
"Oh, Lisbon, it's one of the favourite cities for having international congresses."
So we are at the top.
"- So we're in a group, and there are several other companies there as well, tourism-connected or communication, and event-makers."
So it's all a big synergy of competences.
"It's easy, when you know what you're doing."
"And if you have time enough in advance to prepare all the details, because it's a business built on details."
"And to be prepared for all kinds of ""unexpected""."
So if you are already prepared for what you know is going to happen then you also have time and availabiity to take care of those things that you don't know.
"It's fingerspitzengefuhl, yes, that's for sure."
"This specific congress, as is the case for most of them, is marketed primarily through the website."
"So you want more workers and fewer machines, right?"
"Given the machines and workers, this is a perfectly substitutable production function."
The marginal rate of technical substitution is k over l.
"You're perfectly indifferent between these two, given that-- not perfectly substitutable, but at this point you're indifferent between the two."
"So given that you're indifferent and the machines cost twice as much, why not buy half as many machines?"
Yeah?
AUDlENCE:
"But then, if the machines cost twice as much, why buy any machines?"
JON GRUBER:
"Oh, that's very good point."
Because it's not a perfectly substitutable function.
My bad.
"If it was, if the production function-- great question."
Let's say the production function was of the form q equals k plus l.
That's perfectly substitutable production.
"Then you're right, in that situation you should only buy workers because they do exactly the same thing."
But that's not the case here.
This exhibits diminishing marginal product.
"So if you only bought workers, eventually each worker would do so much less that you'd be better off getting a machine."
"It's not perfectly substitutable, I misspoke before."
At the margin they have an equal effect.
"But as you get more and more laborers, they'll be less and"
"less productive, so eventually you're going to want to buy a machine."
But you're only going to buy half as many machines as workers.
You never want to buy one machine per worker.
"But you also don't want no machines per workers, because the workers won't have anything to do then."
"Here you'd want no machines per worker, right?"
"The optimal thing to do, if you have a perfectly substitutable production function, you'd only just buy the cheaper input."
"But that's not the case when you have diminishing marginal products, then you're going to use a combination of inputs."
But the combination used will be determined by the prices in the market.
Other questions about that?
"So now we can ask, just as we asked in consumer theory, how does a price change in the price of goods affect your consumption decisions, we can ask how does a change in the price of inputs affect your production decisions?"
"So everybody is being slowly poisoning, with artificial coloring, artificial tastes, artificial flavoring."
Nothing will be artificial.
Everything in the future will be organically grown.
"The Venus Project calls for building cities in the sea, which would include research and learning centers dedicated to bettering the ecological conditions in our oceans."
We do have cities in the sea of many different designs.
The purpose of the city in the sea is an university at sea.
"It's to train marine scientists, marine biologists, and what they do is they restore the reefs, restore the damage."
The cities in the sea have units out away from the city.
It's called a wedge.
"It's made of concrete, and it's got cells in it."
And the concrete is towed out and mounted about a mile in front of an island.
"So, if a tsunami occurs, the waves are parted a mile out in heavy seas, you understand?"
That is how we deal with tsunamis.
Earthquakes are generally based upon pressures in the Earth that build up over time.
We will have sensors.
We can dig holes six miles deep today with mining equipment.
We could put sensors deep in the Earth that can let us know well in advance when the pressure build-up is occuring.
How much will it cost?
We don't have that problem in the future.
Do we have the resources to do it?
"Yes we do, and that is all that counts."
"The Venus Project's headquarters is located in a pristine area of south central Florida, USA, on a 9 hectare parcel of land."
The site features a research center and a number of other buildings designed by Mr. Fresco and Ms. Meadows.
"Within the structures are housed many models, illustrations, blueprints, and exhibits related to The Venus Project."
"The center runs informational workshops for the public, where participants are able to discuss Jacque Fresco's ideas face-to-face with him."
There will be many different types of buildings in the future.
Different people with different interests will want to select different types of buildings.
"But in most instances, most of the buildings are curvilinear."
They have curves or bent lines.
And that makes the building much stronger and uses far less material.
"So there would be lots of deck space on buildings so that people can relax, as you notice all the deck space on these buildings."
But people will pick a building that suits their profession and their interests.
"If we take a look at our past, about 20 or 30 years,"
"Brazil was living an era which it was open and eager for democracy, for free speech, like we have now, and we achieved them, and no one wants to lose it."
I think that is absolutely legitimate.
"But what we need to do now is ethically evolve, and build evolved values, and to me, we still need to begin moving towards that."
"But that's just an example, so what's left for society?"
"I absolutely agree, there was a philosopher who said that example isn't the best way to change character, but the only way to do so."
"And if the example that comes from above is worst, we are already lost."
"I believe in that, and if we take a look at what it takes to change a society, we need to look at other societies, the ones that work, that are evolved and developed."
"They were shaped with good examples, so, we also need to create good examples."
"Eduardo, it was wonderful having you here,"
"I want to thank you, and to conclude our chat,"
Veja Online magazine published an article which took a look at how people were rooting in social networks for Sarney to die when he had the bacterial infection in his eyelashes.
And the article was saying that it was wrong for people to be rooting for Sarney's death.
"I'm not going to ask you if you rooted for his death, but I will ask you this:"
"There is a Canadian doctor who's taking one of John Lennon's teeth, and he's promising to make a clone out of him."
Are you in favor of making a clone of Sarney?

So this is my inspiration wall.
"Deconstructing that photo helps you figure out what you like, and you can incorporate that into your own work."

Photo Trekking was birthed out of the travel photos that I've taken over the last few years.
"And the travel stuff that you're seeing here, I've never really been paid for."
"You know, working with charities or shooting my own personal work on vacations or, you know, walk around with a camera, that kind of thing."
"You never know, it could turn into a book,[LAUGH] and that's kind of what happened. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Nick's photos are the story of Pencils of Promise in a lot of ways it's also the emotion of Pencils of Promise."
It's going to tell our story going forward.
"Soon, they all do."
"So, can our ape cousins pass this test?"

"All the great apes - gorillas, orangutans, chimps and bonobos can pass the mark test by a certain age."
Welcome to Lecture six of Networks friends money and bytes.
The question we're going to formulate and answer today is why does Wikipedia even work?
Now the word work here is very vague but roughly speaking means that it achieves what it's sets out to do.
"To create a free, open, online interactive encyclopedia."
And there are many reasons why it should not have worked.
We're going to take a look at the challenges it faced and then zoom into a specific item of consensus formation.
"But before that, let's do a, a very quick recap of what we have been in the space of Work 2.0."
"We talked about Google's page rank, which turns a graph of webpage connection, into a single rank order list, according to the importance scores."
"Then, we talked about Netflix recommendation,"
"Which turns a user movie rating matrix into many ranked orderless, one for each user."
Then we talked about average rating on
"Amazon, or more generally speaking rating aggregation."
That turns a vector of rating scores for each product into a single scaler.
And then use that to generate a ranking for different products.
"The last lecture, or this lecture, we will be talking about voting systems that turns a set of rank ordered lists, many of them, into a single rank order list."
In terms of ambiguity of the problem statement.
Or perhaps this is in ascending order.
Looks like all four of them are very heavily used in both online space in our other aspects of daily lives.
"Now to Wikipedia, which was launched a little over a decade ago in 2001."
And is a result of three movements.
One is wikis as a template for online collaboration.
The other is free and open software movement.
And the third is the emergence of online encyclopedia.
Wikipedia is free.
"Really, it's not that I can't remember that moment. or that I don't want to speak poorly of anyone."
"One thing I do remember was calling two journalists who had been assaulted that night, and I couldn't believe what was happening."
"I said ""this is senseless""."
And I thought if it happened to me I couldn't put up with the idea of people thinking that I'd had it coming.
"You know, thinking ""he must have done something wrong""."
"I thought if it had happened to me, I'd have to do a lot of explaining about what I was doing at that moment."
"And it's a fracture, because you know people, two people who"
"I spoke to that night, and they're anything but violent [laughter]."
Anything but violent!
ST:
Violence is never a good thing.
"For me it was a kind of emotional ""deflowering""."
"I didn't know these things could happen in this country, I couldn't believe it."
"But when the press was assaulted, it was like crossing a border."
Like giving a signal.
I was really moved when I heard that story.
JL:
"I was really moved when I read you, because you explained yourself so well and although bad things happen, there are things that can't happen."
"Although that day there were a lot of things that could be criticised, though I wasn't there,"
I've read a lot of people who I trust from within the 15M movement who did things that normally aren't coherent with the 15M demonstrations.
But that's one thing and what you talked about regarding real atrocities.
"Police abuse that were later well documented, so nobody can deny it."
That also appeared in the mainstream media
"Suddenly the mainstream media were considering as true certain aspects of the police abuse that they would normally be very skeptical of, if there hadn't been documents and proof, thanks to the net, the new technologies, etc."
"Or even myself, I don't think I'm anti anything, but if I didn't know the people who were there and if I hadn't seen the videos maybe I'd have thought there had been agitators within the group."
So I don't shout out to the world that I'm a great defender of freedom for the people in the street.
"I'm saying that if it hadn't been for the internet, a lot of people, who normally got their information from normal sources, would have said ""they must have had it coming""."
And yet you talk to someone you know and you ask yourself how it could happen.
Something breaks.
You stop trusting.
"That night I thought, it's a bitter sensation,"
I thought they'd turned these two friends of mine into two anti-system people.
You know your position down.
"So, do your friends, right?"
This could be use in all sorts of very powerful ways.
"Your car, right?"
Your car should be able to drive itself.
"After all, the car knows where it is, knows where the other cars are, knows where you're going, right?"
"You can monitor in case it has a bug in it, right?"
"But aside from that, the car should take you where you want to go."
"This explosion of real-time telemetry, which is a fantastic explosion on information measured in what are called terabytes and petabytes of information, is the defining computer science data challenge."
And what's interesting about products like
"Google Maps, you saw some of this in our demo, and Google Earth is that people who love the earth--and I hope it's all of us--can love it even more."
"We can know even more about what's going on in our planet, by the way, our only planet that we care so deeply about and want to make sure it's in good shape."
You really do have all the world's information at your fingertips in any language.
There are more than 160 million uses of translate every day.
"That number is, again, growing very, very quickly."
People actually don't all speak English.
"It's always a shock to Americans, sorry."
Germans understand this very well.
It's amazing how much information there is in languages that you don't speak.
"It's true for all of us, and especially for English speakers."
We will know and we can help you figure out what to pay attention to right now.
"The explosion in user content, the explosion in real-time data, what am I thinking, what am I doing, social networks and so forth, we can help you sort that out."
We can help you figure out what is most relevant to you right now.
"Now, it's interesting, you're never lonely because your friends are always nearby, we always know where they are, they're always near you, they're always connected to you, at least in cyberspace."
"Your friends make Google in the web more powerful, they augment it, they make it special, and you're never bored, right?"
"Instead of wasting a lot of time watching television, you can waste time watching the Internet, right?"
And we have a lot more choices for you to waste your time with.
"So, not only you're never lonely, you're never bored."
"And occasionally, you might learn something in the process of being entertained, so whether it's games or movies or videos, and in the Leanback experience, we actually suggest what you should be watching because we know what you care about."
So you don't need to worry so much about what your--what are the choices.
We figure it out for you.
We're never out of ideas.
"I'm sorry, you want to choose something that's 5500K or higher in terms of the color temperature."
"You want to go below 5500K, 5500K is about daylight, so it's just the minimum part of daylight."
"The ones that I have I believe are 6,000K, 85 watt, 4800 lumens."
"Ok, so you can see the setup basically, it's a very simple setup."
You have the two lights that are on either side side of the screen which illuminate the background.
"Now, what I am going to do is switch around so you can see what I am looking at as I am facing the camera."
"Ok, here is my setup so what I am doing when I am reading from the screen, when"
"I am doing a professional video and looking at the camera, this is what I see."
It's in my kitchen my little dining area.
"Basically, it's a real quick setup."
"You have two lights, I am sorry, two lights on either side, so a total of four lights."
"Those are usually called the ""key lights,"" and they illuminate me as I am doing my videos."
"Now, if you zoom up, or if I zoom up I should say and focus there a little bit, you can see that they're clip-on lights."
"They are the shop lights, eight inch shop lights."
"Inside those the bulbs are actually lower wattage, they can be 26 watt cfls"
"Now, you want to choose ones that have a warmer appearance, so you are talking about warmer bulbs, you don't want to get the daylight."
"You want to get 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures."
"The ones that do the screen that illuminate the screen, those are daylight."
"These you want to warm, you want to have more of a warm appearance to whoever is on camera, and those are 3,000K to 3,500K color temperatures"
"Next you see, now normally, that right there, you can see the iPad that is sitting there."
"Normally, the iPad, there's a camera, and the camera I am holding right now."
"The camera is there which I'll go over in a second, and then you have the iPad."
Of course an iPad is expensive.
"You can get a Droid tablet, that's fine."
"You can also rig up something depending on how it is, rig up something so that you could put a table, and then use a laptop as your teleprompter if you even wanted to do a teleprompter so now let's talk about the camera."
"In fact,"
let me go ahead and get my cell phone camera to talk about the camera.
"Ok, so I gave you a little tour."
"A real quick recap as you have the screen, I use a white projection screen."
"You have the two screen lights on either side, very high lumen bulbs to wash out the white background, so it's over-exposed."
"Next, I have on either side of me I have the key lights which are on each side, I have two"
"lower wattage, I think it said 26 watt bulbs, and again, held within the shop lights."

"What we're doing in this video is study a proof of the Pythagorean theorem, that was first discovered,as far as we know by James Garfield in 1876."
What's exciting about this is that he was not a professional mathematician.
You might know James Garfield as the twentieth president of the United States.
"He was elected president in 1880, and then he became president in 1881."
And he did this proof while he was a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives.
What's exciting about that is is it shows that Abraham Lincoln was not the only US politician or the only US president who was into geometry.
And what Garfield realised is that we can construct a right triangle-
"Let's say this side over here is length 'b'(blue) and this side is length 'a'(red), and let's say this side, the hypotenuse of my right triangle, has length 'c'."
And let me make it clear -- it is a right triangle.
He essentially flipped and rotated this triangle to construct another one that is congruent to the first one.
So let me construct that.
So we're going to have length 'b.'
"And it's colinear with length 'a', It's along the same line as length 'a.'"
They don't overlap with each other.
So this is a side of length 'b.'
And then you have your side of length 'a' at a right angle.
And then you have your side of length 'c.'
"So the first thing we need to think about is, &amp;amp;quot;What's the angle between these two sides?&amp;amp;quot;"
What's this mystery angle going to be?
"Well, it looks like something, but let's see if we can prove to ourselves it really is what we think it looks like."
"If we look at this original triangle, and we call this angle 'theta,' what's this angle over here, the angle that's between the sides of length a and c. what's the measure of this angle going to be?"
"Well, theta plus this angle has to add up to 90, because when you add those two together, they add up to the 90."
So 90 and 90 you get 180 degrees for the interior angles of this triangle.
"So if these two angles together is 90, then this angle is '90 minus theta'."
"Well if this angle up here is congruent -- (And we've constructed it so it is congruent.) the angle corresponding to theta is also going to be theta,"
And this angle right over here is also going to be 90 - theta.
I can't feed everyone that comes up to me so he's going to have to beg some scraps from the suitors.
"Now, in doing that on page 354, what Telemachus is doing is positioning his father, disguised as the beggar."
And positioning his father in such a place that he can now get to know what the lay of the land is hanging around with the suitors.
"And then, Telemachus shows his responsibility, kind of stepping up a little bit more."
"His first conversation with Penelope, he says I need to go meet my friend,"
"Theoclymenus, whom I brought with me and I need to take care of him."
He says on page 356.
"So he's starting to, sort of, step up."
He's been educated.
Let's see here in this picture of the young Telemachus getting schooled.
He's been educated and he's now ready to start taking responsibility for some of the things in this house.
"Closing off, book seventeen, there's a different statement that comes out"
Telemachus' mouth than the one that we're used to seeing him.
"Remember in those early books, he's constantly talking about how the gods are not on my side, if only the gods were on my side, the gods are giving awful things to me."
"He now says what heroes say at the close of seventeen, page 374."
"I'll tend to all things here, I and the deathless gods."
Now this is what a hero does.
"Yeah, sure, it's up to the gods, but it's also up to me."
There's an understood double determination in the events that go on for a hero in the events that a hero is responsible for.
"Yeah, sure, the gods steers all things but that doesn't mean that the hero is not, therefore, also responsible for what happens in, in the, the, the purview of the hero, what's going on in their terrain."
The theme carries on in book eighteen.
"Telemachus is still hovering around the center of the city, and when he sees"
"Odysseus as this beggar, and Iris, the other lowly beggar."
"The two of them are about to get into a fight and there's nasty words back and forth and they take oaths at the beginning So if I win, this happens."
"If you win, that happens."
This all unfolds on page 377.
"Odysseus, Telemachus at that point steps up and says okay, you all can, can count on me to guarantee the oaths that you've just taken."
I am going to be the guarantor of the oaths that you all just taken so go ahead and have your fight but under the understanding that I'm going to make sure that what you all agree to is going to get executed in the end.
That kind of authority to execute on someone else's promises is the kind of thing that someone who's in charge of a situation takes.
So Telemachus is showing himself to be that way.
"After Penelope in Book eighteen points out how this stranger Odysseus was abused by the suitors, he jumps in and starts to take responsibility for that situation too."
"And so at this point on, page 383, that"
They need nutrients.
Where are they going to get it?
Student:
Weathering or--
Prof:
They could get it from weathering or they could get it from upwelling.
Where does upwelling occur?
Student:
On a costal reef.
Prof:
"Yeah, continental margins."
"Get out in the middle of the ocean and there's actually a tremendous amount of fertilizer there but it's five miles down, three to five miles down, and you just can't get it up."
"It's sealed off, because the top of the ocean is warm and the bottom of the ocean is cold, and there's no way that cold water can come up through warm water, unless you have Coriolis force or wind or something like that driving it."
So that's why the open oceans are deserts.
You'll notice that tropical rainforests are highly productive per square meter.
In general forests are pretty productive.
Swamps and streams are very productive.
"Algal beds and reefs are quite productive, and so are estuaries."
"So if you want to go someplace where you're-- you know, you're a naturalist, you like creepy-crawlies, you want frogs in your pocket, you want to see something new for Christmas, you go to these places; that's where you'll see a lot of stuff."
Okay?
"So right there you already know where the prospecting is good, if you like to see lots of biodiversity."
"Now if you look at percent contribution to global primary production, the open oceans again crop up, and that is because there's just so darn much of them."
"If you're out there in space, looking at the world, you realize that you can fit all of the continents into the"
Pacific Ocean; it's bigger than all the continents put together.
And most of it is open ocean; most of it is low primary productivity open ocean.
But there's just so darn much of it that on the planetary scale it's making a pretty good contribution.
"And the tropical rainforests are big enough so that even though they're only 3 and a half or 4% of the globe, they have such high primary productivity that they're kicking in quite a bit."
"And the others, even though they are productive, occupy such a small portion of the globe that they're not contributing that much."
"Okay, so this is an overall view of energy flow on the planet, at least for the photosynthetically driven part of the planet."
The sun is sending in the energy.
"And by the way, any idea of roughly how much of the sunlight that comes into the planet is actually captured by"
life?
[laughter]

Young was a sound engineer and as a sound engineer he was very familiar with the interference of sound.
He knew that sound and sound can make silence.
And so in 1801 he demonstrated in a convincing way that light plus light can create darkness.
"That would be the nail in the coffin that would demonstrate uniquely that light are indeed waves, and there was still this controversy between Huygens and Newton as you perhaps remember."
Newton wanted light to be particles but Huygens wanted them to be waves.
And the way that Young did his experiment is as follows.
"He had a screen, don't think of it as this big, you're talking now about extraordinarily small dimensions, you will understand shortly how small, and in this screen are two openings, two pinholes, and light is coming from the left and think of light as being plane waves."
"They reach these two openings and these two openings according to Huygens will produce circular waves, spherical waves of course, three-dimensionally."
These openings become Huygens sources and spherical waves will propagate out in this direction.
And so now we have exactly the situation that we had with our sound.
Now if all works well there should be directions theta away from this line where you see darkness and other directions where you see bright light.
"And we are going to do it in a way, we have the luxury of laser beams, so we have very strong"
"light sources, which Young did not have."
"The way we are going to do it, we have a -- a slide, which is completely black, but with a razor blade two"
lines have been drawn on it.
And so I will draw these lines as white lines.
"And like Frank Borzage, Robsen and Lewten take this as an opportunity to embellish detail and atmosphere."
In the film.
"The film is a web of repeated and varied motifs, like knives."
"There are knives in the window in the very beginning of the film, and then Finn has a knife as our hero goes on board."
"There's a bayonet on the wall of Stone's office, and of course the film ends in a knife fight."
"Or there's the picture of Ellen on Stone's desk, which is put on top of a navigation map."
Which pretty much sums up Stones problem with his relationship.
"Or there's the way that the men have to be careful to coil the rope in just the right direction, which then echoes the way that"
Louie has to coil the chain the right way in the chain lock.
And the reason I picked this film is that sound is so important to its texture.
Just think about how many times hearing and sound are mentioned or made important to the plot.
The film begins with a blind beggar.
There's Finn who cannot speak but hears what other men can't hear.
Our hero's best friend is a radio man who puts on his headphones to block out the madness of the captain.
"When Bound talks to our hero, he says he better pull in his ears and not criticize the captain."
"The crew on the ship, does their job by using sound, not by necessarily speech."
"On the bridge, someone will ring a bell, and on the deck, that bell will be answered."
"Fog horns are, of course, important becasue they turn sound into space, they tell, they map space and dangers at sea"
Through sound.
"Billy Rad sings on the boat, to entertain the crew, but he's also expressing the real feelings of the crew."
"And since this is an inexpensive film, they can't afford to show sailors in front of actual sea."
"The most we get is a sailor in front of a the backdrop with the cloud painted on it, moving up and down a little bit."
"So, sound takes over."
The sound of the wind and the sound of the sea.
"And depending on where you are on ship, you're either the wind or the sea."
Or the sound of the engines of the boat.
And they become oppressive and meaningful across the film.
It's also an excellent film for illustrating how most Hollywood film makers use sound.
"Mixing ambient sounds and side effects, keeping dialogue on top, then bringing in an underscore orchestral music score to tell us the character's emotions even if the character isn't directly expressing them as emotions."
So I would like to take a look at.
"Bits of this film beginning at the opening scene, and think about how Robson and"
Lewton make sound important to their atmospheric horror.
You can't say it's a bad thing.
"Even if you don't agree with the 15M, if you put someone who has nothing to do with the 15M in front of 4 people and say ""you're going to laugh"", in the end you get caught up in it, emotionally, through humour."
I think that's really important.
There are a lot of people who I believe were hooked on the 15M because it's fun.
And it has been fun.
"I don't know if it still is for everyone, but for a lot of people it has been fun. and the use of false identities, which is another debate altogether, has also contributed to get certain absurd examples of behaviour out of the furrows."
People who pretend to be someone else and talk to other Twitter users who react in a really absurd way.
So absurd it's real.
And that serves to expose certain things.
Undoubtedly it's the most original political action there is.
But it's just the beginning.
I think it's always going to be that original from now on.
"The large protests are going to be like that via the networks, with sarcasm, with a sense of humour where the individual is above political affiliation."
I think all that can be used by completely opposing ideologies.
"And we're simply at the start of a new form of political participation, to achieve the most diverse goals."
"Not just with goals that, for example 73% of the population can empathise with, but anything that goes beyong political parties and NGOs, it can be organised through the net."
ST:
Let's wrap this up.
"Out of everything that's happened, what do you think has been the most important thing?"
JL:
I think there has been a change in the mentality of society.
Vital attitude.
A door to participation in politics of the future has opened.
A way of allowing people to participate publicly from here on in.
"Not just because of the protests and the assemblies, but because of what's happening on the internet."
I think it's become obvious that a lot of people organised spontaneously and very suddenly- I mean we're organised today for this and tomorrow I don't need to know you- can impose the political agenda of a country.
Almost nothing.
"And I think it's also going to serve as an experience of political maturity for a lot of people, this has been their first political experience."
"Young people, and not so young people who have had their first political experience, and are learning a lot about this world, regarding the media, politics, team work."
Good lessons and bad lessons.
And how this atmosphere of maturity is going to evolve is quite eye-catching.
"Because if there are people who think the 15M is naive, maybe their strength is non confrontation,"
"Somebody asked, ""What's special about special relativity, and what's general about general relativity?"""
How do they relate?
"So, we'll come back to that one."
"Somebody also asked,"
"""Why use the speed of light to convert time into space and vice versa, to get them in the same coordinate system?"""
"So, why use c to convert time to space and vice versa?"
"And then, also, there was the question of, you know, ""What is the mathematical formulation of general relativity?"""
"So, how to express general relativity in some kind of equation."
"And we'll get to the key equation, which is something called a metric, for general relativity, and then we're going to stop."
Because to go on from there is fairly heavy calculus and we're just not going to do that.
But I want to get at least that far.
"Okay, so let's go back to special relativity for a minute."
"So, special relativity."
"Flat space-time, no gravity."
And you'll recall what happens.
"As you get close to the speed of light, all sorts of things that you thought were kind of constant and properties of objects,"
"like mass and length and duration, and duration of time, and things like that, all start to get weird and change."
"So, length, time, mass, all these things, vary with the velocity of the person doing the measuring."
"And so, you could ask the question, is there anything that doesn't vary?"
Is there anything that's an invariant?
"And the answer is, yes."
There are some things that don't vary.
"So, some things are invariant."
"And Einstein actually said later in his career that it's actually the invariants that are important, not the things that change."
"And so, he should have called his theory invariant theory instead of relativity theory."
Think of what that would have done to pop philosophy.
"Instead of saying, ""everything is relative,"" all this stuff, you would have had the exact same theory."
You would have called it invariance theory.
"And the pop philosophy interpretation of this would be,"
"""some things never change."""
And it would have been a whole different concept in three in the morning dorm room conversations.
"Okay, so some things are invariant, what things?"
"But despite these limitations, Wiki has been, Wikipedia has been extremely powerful in certain fields like medicine the Wikipedia entries are extremely well documented."
So now we have to look at some of the underlying reasons.
Okay.
Including forming consensus on conscientious articles.
Among a community of possibly anonymous contributors.
One way to look at the challenge of consensus formation is to look at the order of growth.
"For example, if we look at."
A network.
With many nodes and many links.
We often say that there is a network effect.
"And a positive one, where something good Gross."
As the square of the number of nodes and okay the something good for example could be the utility of the presence of a node.
Now this implicitly assumes that every node is linked to every other node.
Or at least the number of links a node has growth linearly.
As N.
"So we'll later come back to this positive network effect, this n-square law, in various lectures."
But today we'll also look at the complementary picture that is two to the n law.
Suppose each one of these n nodes is just a binary state of mind.
"For example, do I support a certain political position or do I not support?"
"Then out of N, knows that two to the N possibilities of configurations."
And yet we would like to reach a consensus.
This exponential growth two to the n in the number of people in the crowd or network highlights the difficulty of reaching consensus.
There're just too many possibilities.
"And yet, consensus we must reach, and what"
Wikipedia practice is what they call the good faith collaboration.
There are rules and guidelines.
There are mechanisms .
For encouraging collaboration.
"Consensus formation is one huge challenge, there are also three related challenges, one is that it is free."
"So how can something free, work in later lectures."
"And in fact in the first two lectures of this course, we say how pricing"
Information played a very important role in providing the right incentives.
They get a date with a guy that we have a crush on.
And the flipside is that we are always doing things that make other people upset.
Even if we don't realize doing it.
It's very easy to make someone else mad.
Helping some people can hurt others.
I was trying to be very helpful in the Zande village by sowing dresses for friends.
Who got mad at me?
The local Taylor.
I was taking away his business.
"When I took pictures for ID cards for students in [inaudible] for free, who got mad at me?"
The local photographer.
I was taking away his clients.
My Zande students would never answer questions in class.
They hated any kind of praise.
They didn't want anyone to know what grades they are getting.
They were terribly afraid that they'd make other people mad at them: jealous of them and then that would arouse their jealousy and their witchcraft.
"So with possible witch is all around you, no Zande wants to stand out, be richer, smarter, more beautiful, more successful."
"That causes jealousy and envy, and that can heat up witchcraft and cause bad things to happen."
Neither do Zande want to be poor or unsuccessful or miserable for they then will be accused of being witches and of causing misfortune and others.
Because they'd be the obvious one who would be jealous.
"People who are lucky who have opportunities such as scholarships to study abroad as this young man did, he actually got his PhD at the University of Paris right after I did."
They set themselves up for witchcraft.
"They return home as college professors, businessmen, bureaucrats, they earn good wages, and the next thing you know, they get sick and die."
"Unfortunately, as this young man did."
"People who get good jobs are inundated with requests for help from dozens if not hundreds of family members and help they must or they'll be seen as stingy and selfish, and they'll-- yeah."
And then soon their children will fall ill.
It's a very good system for wealth distribution.
"And it causes many Zande to question the wisdom of getting ahead, for they'll have to share their good fortune so widely that in the end, they won't really be ahead at all."
"In Africa today, the disparity between rich and poor is growing."
Development puts money in the hands of some but leaves others behind.
"So even though education and scientific knowledge is growing, witchcraft accusations are also growing."
"Moreover, whereas traditionally, only mentally competent adults were accused of witchcraft, nowadays, young children and even senile elders are accused and sometimes they're tortured into confessing."
"And to illustrate this,"
"I'd like to talk about  a project called ""Planet Hunters""."
"So Planet Hunters is a project that's been running for a few years now, and we thought we'd try  and discover planets around other stars."
This is the most exciting area of astronomy right now.
We thought there might be a few planets left over for our citizen scientists to catch.
"Now whenever you go hunting planets,  you can't see the planets directly."
What you have to do instead is look for  the indirect signs that they're there.
"And one of the most effective methods  is to look for what we call ""Transits""."
A planet transiting in front of its star will cause the start to dip in brightness  by much less than 1%.
"But if you can catch that dip, then you can infer that the planet is there."
"It's a rather simple case of Dark Matter, if you like."
You can infer that this planet is there from the data.
"And we have data from NASA's Kepler satellite, which is staring -- actually Kepler, I feel rather sorry for it, it's got the most boring job in the world, because it just stares at 150,000 stars, and every 29 minutes tells us what brightness they are."
"It can send that data down here, and we can look for these transits."
And sometimes these transits are really obvious.
( beeping )
"In fact, in this case, they're so obvious that you can hear them."
That modulation is the dip at the repeated transit of a planet orbiting its star in just a few days.
But sometimes the transits aren't so obvious.
"This is what it might just look like to be on a moon, orbiting a Neptune sized world, now know as Planet Hunters 1B."
This was a planet discovered by a group of citizen scientists using our project.
And Planet Hunters 1B is currently a unique world.
It's the only world that we know of  that has 4 suns in its sky.
"So this is a system with 2 pairs of stars, and a planet orbits one of those pairs."
It's a planet that simulations tell us shouldn't exist.
So we didn't even know to look for this and yet there it is.
And it's there because a group of volunteers saw something strange in the data and they didn't even tell us about it.
"They went out, they got more data from the professional NASA website."
"They did their own analysis, and they came to us when  they'd worked out what was going on."
"These were people who did not start off as scientists, who'd gone through the engine of motivation, being convinced that they could do something real by taking part in the main project and then collaborated together to make a truly gobsmacking discovery."
"And then we made the nice image, so that they could try and image  what that planet was like."
This is real citizen science.
"But instead of setting a temporary ID to the element, to save time, I can just type $0 in the console."
This is a shortcut reference to whatever element is currently selected in this panel.
"It's just a regular reference, so if I'm using jQuery I can toss it into it's dollar method easily."
"Now over on the Network tab, I'd like to share a few things."
"In this waterfall chart, two lines are added."
"The blue one points out where the DOMContentLoaded event fires, which is basically ""document ready"" and the red is window's load event, which waits for all images and iframes to finish."
Now you probably have had to inspect the cookies that are associated with your page request before.
"The Headers tab has that info as one of the request headers, but you can now view the current cookies in table format."
"You also have the size of each cookie, which you want to keep as small as possible, as all the cookies are sent in the HTTP header with every request of the page."
"Now, I'd like to show you a few handy features when doing Javascript debugging."
I'm going to bring up a page with some basic script.
"So here, I can filter our results here using search or a category filter."
Easy enough.
This gallery.js contains most of the functionality.
Now I'd like to add some logging to see what's going on.
"In Chrome, I can edit the script on the fly inside the Ul."
This feature is unique to Chrome because of how the V8 Javascript engine executes your code.
I'm going to jump down to the showGallery function.
I can use cmd-G or ctrl-G to jump to a specific line number.
"Now I'd really like to dig into this JSON argument here, so I'm going to console log it out."
"Now when I filter, I get the object logged to the console, where I can poke around with it further."
You'll notice I'm also getting an exception thrown on the page.
Sometimes it's difficult to figure out where these errors are coming from.
"By clicking on this pause button, I can ask the dev tools to pause execution whenever an exception is encountered, effectively giving me a breakpoint at that position."
"I can now open up the console, again by hitting"
"Escape, and figure out what's going on."
Whoops!
Looks like that element doesn't exist yet.
I guess it's time to file a bug report.
"If you'd like to dive into the dev tools, I definitely recommend picking up a dev channel version of Chrome."
It updates weekly and gets new features in the dev tools very regularly.
Holding your baby is something that's very different for every individual you really need to hold them in a way that is most comfortable for you.
So we will often reject a paper.
Right away.
And now let me just tell you the process that we go through at the American Journal of Epidemiology.
"At first, it's looked at by the editor-in-chief and then he assigns it to one of the other editors, who really makes the final decision and I happen to play that role, as a general epidemiology editor."
"There are other more specialized editors that work just in cancer, or just in cardiovascular disease or just in infectious diseases, but I tend to be more general."
And so.
"If the two of us think that the paper is not going to be of sufficient priority to be accepted, even if it's good science and well-reviewed, then as a favor to the authors, we won't delay a rejection of it."
"Another, beside novelty, another criterion we look at is interest to the readers of this particular journal."
"For example, sometimes we'll get a paper that really is not so much an epidemiological study, but a way to improve public health, and we will decide, you know, this is really."
"More suitable to a, to a public health journal then to the American Journal Of"
Epidemiology.
"We, also look for good writing, and this can be especially a be a problem, with a non-english speaking author."
"Usually when a paper comes from a foreign country, often the english is, really, bad and we know it's gonna need a lot of work, and we think it's a good study, we will often, send it back and say please have a, someone, a native english speaker go through this and edit it."
"And occasionally this comes, when a foreign, person who is, who's english who's, lang, need of languages not english."
It works in an American institution and submits a paper.
So you know usually that is not a problem.
But it can be.
Mm-hm.
Another Fact.
"Factors that you know, don't make the paper too long."
Don't put in too much excess material that's not needed.
And another important problem is what we call slicing the salami too thin.
"Yes, yeah that would be great for you to say a bit about it."
"You know, if you, [laugh], I have a study that involves both men and women and want to try to get two papers out of it say here's what that risk factor, here's the effect of this risk factor in men."
And then another paper here's the effect of this risk factor in women that is really frowned upon by journals.
And my own personal experience is that I was I had to deal with this as an author.
"A colleague and I, each wrote a paper about health effects of cigar smoking."
This was at Kaiser Permanente.
His was on cardiovascular disease.
Mine was on cancer.
"I submitted I, mine to the, Annals of Epidemiology and was accepted."
He submitted his to the New England Journal.
So they're really critical for a Greywater System.
And you don't actually have to do anything; you just need to have healthy soil.
And I just want to show you my favorite one.
"This is, you know, sort of not an exactly realistic picture."
So microscopic organism; this one is called the Tardigrade.
Any of you heard of the Tardigrade?
"Now, this little bitty microscopic organism went into space and it survived space and it formed, turns itself into a cyst and can survive pretty much anything."
It came back to earth and reproduced.
"So these things are--you know, in the soil, there's really strong organisms that can do just about anything like survive space."
"So we don't--if we get our Greywater going into healthy soil, we don't have to worry so much about the nutrients in it and the gunky stuff. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BULLOCK:"
Thanks.
"So, the Tardigrades are going to save us."
"Okay, we're going to take a little bit of a deeper dive now and focus on one particular system, the laundry to landscape system."
And I think the value of taking a focus on this one is this is considered like the low-hanging fruit of Greywater Systems.
It's a great place to start.
And I'll just run you through at a very high level here how it's done.
"Firstly, obviously, as Laura had mentioned, we have to be careful about what detergents or soaps we use in the first place."
We have to use non-toxic ingredients.
"And then we can re-use that water that's coming out of the washing machine, divert it--and"
I'll show you some parts here in a minute--out to the landscape and grow food with it or shelter or a beautiful backyard oasis.
"Really, whatever we desire in terms of our backyard spaces or front yard landscapes, for that matter."
"Here's a little deeper dive; oops, excuse me."
This is a schematic of a laundry to landscape system.
It shows you how the plan would work in effect.
"Obviously, it's showing the collection plumbing here that distributes out to the landscape--thank you--out to the landscape and actually, emits the water directly into the soil."
And that connects with the mulch basins that we just heard Laura talk to.
"So, the beauty of this system is that, well, for one, it has a built-in pump."
It uses the pump of the washing machine.
"So if there are any distributions challenges, maybe you have a slight incline."
There are some ways to overcome those challenges because you have this built-in pump.
"Apart from that, no additional gadgetry is required."
"No filters to break down, which is wonderful."
"You're going to be very, very busy."
It's going to ruin your evening.
It's our strategy.
Some more questions?
Yes? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ASANTl:
"Matt Asanti, IFA International. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Hi there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ASANTl:
"You mentioned all of the benefits of the new technology and I'm sure when you're doing your research as well, you're considering the downsides with all of the information that you're collecting and possessing."
"So, what are the dangers according to you?"
And do you think there's a real danger also in creating an elite by restricting access to the Internet as well? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:
"Well, for the latter part, we've worked, all of us at Google, I personally--many people that I've worked with have worked very hard to make the Internet available to everyone."
"And because of the tremendous success of mobile phone, data and a particular GPRS edge, UMTS and now LTE Technology, it's reasonable to expect that over the next 5 to 10 years, 5 out of the 6 billion or so humans will have access to some level of mobile connectivity and some number of billions, certainly more than one because we're nearly there now, will have access to powerful smartphones and the kind of web computing."
"That is a life-changing experience for them, so I'm very, very excited about it."
I think that the downsides are all obvious.
"It's always a shock to people to discover that criminals use the telephone, and yet we still use the phone."
We haven't banned the telephone.
"And I think the fact of the matter is that there are evil people in the world, they will use this technology."
It's important that we be alert.
It's important that we recognize that the laws are there for the reason that we all follow them.
But we have no illusion about how this technology could be misused as well.
"And I think that the governments in the world, police forces and so forth need to focus on this because it will be a new source, among other things, of some bad behavior as well as hopefully enormous amount of good behavior. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [INDlSTlNCT], I'm working for a German"
Radio Stations.
Will Google phones also be able to identify people in the future?
"You gave us a great example with this cathedral, how about I point my hand--my Google phone on just, say, a person that I want his email address or like his hobbies or--can Google help me with that? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
The answer is no.
And I hope that--and
"I'm sorry if you wanted that feature, it's no."
There are a number of reason why it's no.
"One is it's illegal because you can't use--in the European law, you can't use that kind of information which, I think, is a good law."
So the second thing is that it would be a significant invasion of people's privacy.
"So, if people want to give you that information, it's easy for them to transmit it, but you won't be able to randomly find things out about people without their permission. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; And in the US? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
Same answer.
"So I, I was hoping you could comment on that."
[laugh].
"Well I. I, I don't think you'll necessarily dumb down the science."
"And, of course you do want precision and clarity."
"But, I think you should avoid jargon and things that are really hard to understand."
"George Comstock, who's no longer alive but he was used to be the Editor in Chief of the American Journal of Epidemiology, used to say that, papers should be understandable by someone with a good college education or someone who reads the Scientific American."
"It does not have to be full of jargon that's only understood by your, your peers and your particular specialty."
Yeah.
So I would.
You know we welcome things that are very readable and easy to read.
"I don't, I, I, I would not have that fear at all."
Yeah and.
"In terms of getting published when you get two papers in and say they were the same science and one was very jargony and you know, sounds sort of the way, scientists think they have to write and you have one that's clear, can you comment on your chances of publication."
"Well you know, if both of them get peer reviewed and, and very highly rated and they seem like, they seem important to the editors we might ask."
"You know, to please explain what you mean by this, word or by this sentence?"
"Yeah, yeah."
So it will take an extra step if it's really hard to understand and not clear to most readers.
"Yeah, yeah."
And what advice can you give specifically to first time authors?
"I imagine a lot of, the students in this course are, you know, early in their career."
"And haven't had a chance to get published yet or, or, in the process of submitting their first papers?"
"What bothers me most, is when I get a paper, you know, often be from a really good institution and the senior author at the end of the list is someone who's well known, but it's clear its been written by a student, [laugh], and, if it sounds like a thesis, it sounds like a Phd thesis, or masters thesis, Which, and it contains every conceivable strength of the study, every conceivable weakness, [laugh], so that, to prove, in writing the thesis they learned what they were supposed to learn in a school public."
Author in their graduate program.
"So, Right is if you were more established senior scientist who knows what other scientists understand."
"And, you don't have to explainuh, something to everything."
"I just happened to see a paper this morning in the latest journal of the American Journal of Epidemi-, the latest issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology that was going over the strength and limitations of there study."
"And, it was a study about mortality and, in whites and African Americans and related to a certain."
"Factor, and I was saying, one of the strength of our study is that we had a"
large African American.
Population as part of this study group.
"Well, that's sort of obvious or you wouldn't."
"Right, right, [laugh]."
let that fade away.
"You have to think about, OK, just the interface."
Is the interface conveying the right things?
"And then beyond the interface, the mental model."
How is the user simulating this in their head?
What information are they getting out of it?
"So back to the diagram, letting that implementation fade away."
So that's self-describing.
"At least, that's talking about if something should be self-describing, but how do you pull that off?"
"It's one thing to say it's important, it's another thing to tell you literally how to do it."
So there's at least five ways.
"The first one is consistency, and this is cheating, basically."
"It works great, but it's also a kind of a tautology to say, hey, if I design something that's things that the user already knows, they're going to know how to use it."
That is true.
"You do not have to rely on this entirely, though."
"In fact, Google products are often very different from what's already in the marketplace, and they still are able to bootstrap knowledge from users and have them figure it out."
"I mean, in the case of Gmail, it was sort of a radical reimagination of how email interfaces worked, but it still worked."
"And also, if everyone did consistency all the time, we wouldn't see dramatic innovation in interfaces."
So we're not going to focus on this one too much.
"Basically, it's really useful, and you can guarantee that users are going to understand your application if you focus on consistency, but it's not the only way."
So the second one is affordances.
"Let's go back to the test chamber, and let's say one day, they encounter this, and they've never seen it before, and they're thinking, whoa, that's really interesting."
This might actually be a way out of the test chamber.
And how are they going to figure that out?
Everything about this design is designed to convey what it does.
"The way that the door is recessed from the frame, the curvature of the handle, the way that you can just imagine the handle rocking in."
"You might not know on which side of the door it's going to open, and you might not know what the words mean, but the picture sure looks like yourself and it seems to be going through it."
But that's sort of cheating.
"Just the physical design of this has been very carefully crafted so that when you look at it, you understand what it's going to do."
You understand that you need to push on it.
"And this is a type of thing that we do just throughout the day, constantly, where you encounter stuff and you have to look down and say, I'm going to push on that."
"It's just this kind of thing that cognitively, you're just constantly doing without really even thinking about it."
It's a stupid world.
"Let's go back to the beginning, OK, to the very first browser and the very first server."
"Initially they were both on the same machine, but eventually they figured out how to put a wire between them, and that was a good thing, that's when it started to get interesting."
"Pretty quickly you get to the point where you've got so many browsers trying to attack one server that one server can't do it anymore, so we had to start thinking about how we're going to scale."
"Historically what we did was put a distributor in front of the servers, so each request that comes in can route either at random or round robin or least loaded, whatever policy you want."
The message goes somewhere else and that server deals with it.
Then you've got a database in the back that they can all share.
The database becomes a problem -- that becomes a bottleneck.
"Initially everybody was using some kind of relational database there, which I think was a really bad fit for this."
The relational database was developed at IBM back in the mainframe era to solve a completely different class of problems than we have here.
"But there were a lot of people who understood how they worked, and understanding how they work means you don't have to rethink anything, so great, we'll just take that and put it in."
And they didn't scale.
"So in the decades since then, we've done a lot of things — figuring out how to shard them and do other stuff -- and in doing that you break the relational model, so most of the goodness you got from that model you don't get any more."
"But at least you don't have to rethink anything, OK, so"
life continues.
"But at some point even that doesn't work, so you start looking for other options."
"People have come up with no SQL databases, which are wonderful."
I love these things.
There's
"Mongo, and Couch, and all the others."
They're great.
"People are kind of going back and changing the assumptions, and going what's really important here?"
The important thing often is scalability.
"You're going to trade off a lot of other things in order to get that, and we're getting it, so that's really good."
It turns out Yahoo!'s been doing this for a long time.
"We had a massive home grown no SQL database introduction here since 1996, so we've been doing this for a long time too."
It's wonderful stuff.
But now let's put Ajax on top of all of this.
This model was not designed for Ajax.
"This was something that we kind of figured out after the fact that we could do, and it's not optimal for us."
The biggest problem is: where does the server put its state?
"Because this model assumes that it's stateless, so that any request can go to any server."
"What it is it's sort of like charismatic power - being likable, having a charm factor, being respected highly, being looked up to for who you are, for you integrity, for the way you think, for the way you're cool and calm and rational, and you're cooperative and collaborative, and you just have these characters that people admire."
You're actually going to see this in some of your assignments.
Maybe you'll see it in groups you belong to.
You know people like this.
"Everybody follows them because they seem to know how to act, but also their ideas are pretty good, and they just set such a good example by the way they are."
"The third type of power, we tend to use it too much, it's called expert power."
"You know it's having the answers, having some knowledge, bringing knowledge in from our past."
We have the answers because we've done this before.
"You know, every group needs expert power."
"You need people who are veterans who have some experience, so they can bring it to the group as long as it's not overdone or telling the group what to do or the know-it-all."
You've got to be real careful about overusing expert power.
"Let the group sort of make its decisions, bringing ingredients in appropriately as an information giver, as we talked about that role, rather than trying to control outcomes by overusing expert power to sway a group toward something you think is best."
The fourth of these types of power is called reward power.
"Now, reward power is the ability to give people something, some kind of perks."
"Maybe, ""I'll bring refreshments next time, again."""
"And everybody says, ""Ah, I love that."""
Maybe you're a good cook; you can bake something.
"I was in a Bible study once, and it was a men's Bible study, a bunch of farmers six in the morning, and we all took turns."
It was such a cool thing.
There was a reward there though.
"It was almost like, you brought the cookies, you brought the baked goods, cinnamon rolls, and you made the coffee, and everybody took turns giving perks, and it was all sort of a cool thing."
"If you've every been in a group, maybe somebody in the group says,"
"""Alright if we succeed in this, I'll buy everybody dessert at Applebee's after the meeting if we can figure this out by nine o' clock."""
"So, if there is some reward power everybody is on task."
They want this to happen.
"And the next of these, the fifth type of power, is what we call coercive power, where we punish people."
"We don't like somebody's idea, so we try to embarrass them."
We try to criticize them; we try to shut them down.
We try to get them to be quiet.
And those are not good things.
"And this is where gate keeping comes in, so we don't allow people to misuse gate keeping to quiet down people while letting other people talk more."
And the last of these is persuasive power.
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.
It was deemed impossible.
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
"The human form, in particular the human head, has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry."
"The project came back to us about a decade later, and this time with a director named David Fincher."
"Now, Fincher is an interesting guy."
"David is fearless of technology, and he is absolutely tenacious."
"And David won't take ""no."""
"And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry, that anything is possible as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money."
"And so David had an interesting take on the film, and he threw a challenge at us."
He wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor.
It happened to be this guy.
"We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors."
"That was one idea: that we would have different actors, and we would hand off from actor to actor."
We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.
"We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up, particularly in close-up."
And makeup is an additive process.
You have to build the face up.
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face to bring the aging to this character.
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.
"So we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of Benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head, aged to appear as Benjamin, and attach that to the body of the real actor."
Sounded great.
"Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry, and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either, because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store, you know -- we see his face constantly."
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.
There were two studios involved:
Warner Brothers and Paramount.
"And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course, but it was a very high-risk proposition."
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work ...
"But despite our verbal assurances, they wanted some proof."
"And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin."
And we did it in about five weeks.
Evaluation is that it's still unacceptable.
"And so, you put on another expanded control which is periodic changes to the password."
"Again, simplistic example but it gives you the idea."
"With respect to integrity, you'll remember we had the two, two, and two, which would give us eight."
The decision was to retain it.
"Retain the, the integrity risk. it was, the management decided it was acceptable because there were adequate controls in place."
"With respect to availability, it was a twelve."
The decision was made to treat it by reducing it.
"A couple of controls were put in place, maintain the server hardware periodically, install anti-virus software."
"That brought the level of threat down to oh, actually, maint, maintained the level of threat at three, but brought the level of vulnerability down to a one, so that brought our risk point down to six."
"At that point, it was acceptable, adequate controls were viewed to be in place."
"And this is the kind of thing you can do for every, every, risk that you might, or every asset, information asset in your organization above a certain level."
"And then, you know, you, you, up, you know, in front, at the beginning of the process, users define what the acceptable level of risk is."
"In this case, it was eight."
"So, at the beginning, we had one that was acceptable, and two that weren't."
"After we applied our preventive controls, we still had one that was unacceptable, and so we did something additional and we had two that were acceptable."
"So, that's, that's kind of the process you're going to go through."
Does that make sense to everybody?
"It's a little more simp, more, more straight forward than what you saw with the 800-30."
"It's something you can actually sit down and do, you know?"
"800-30 is almost, you know, a career."
"[laug hs] And that's not to say it shouldn't be used, cuz it's a very, very thorough, very complete, very comprehensive standard."
We went to the campaign head-quarters.
It was very crowded there.
Some people were standing in Mirhadi Street.
"Everyone was very anxious, and wanted to know what was going on."
Some people listened to the radio.
Some spoke of rumors of Ahmadinejad's lead.
Others denied it.
No one knew whether it was true or just rumors destined to undermine our morale.
"But around midnight it was officially declared that five million votes had been counted, out of which Mr. Ahmadinejad had obtained more than 3 million votes."
"Mousavi had one million something, and Mr. Karroubi and Rezaei had obtained very few votes."
I want to eat the things I ought to.
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
I want to reach the greatest mountain.
"Climb, if I want, without all the shouting."
"I just want to know that I feel strong, you know."
"And clouds really should be white at least, and oceans should meet us at the beach, and I don't want to overreach when I know what's in store... [instrumental and chorus]"
"[rhythmic dripping, haunting melody continues]"
And here we have the result of some simulations of the exploratory agent.
We see it's doing much better than the passive agent or than the Greedy agent.
So I'm graphing here; and we only had to go through 100 trials.
We didn't have to go through 500--so it's converging much faster.
And it's converging to much better results.
"So the policy loss and the dotted lines started off high; but after only 20 trials, it's come down to perfect."
"So it learned the exact, correct policy after 20 trials."
"The error in the utilities--so you can have the perfect policy, while not quite having the right utilities for each state-- and the errors in utility comes down, and that, too, comes down to a level that's lower than the previous agent's-- but still, not quite perfect."
"And we see here that it, in fact, learns the correct policy."
"Now that we have constructed Hilbert spaces and Orthonormal bases, we can see some of their distinguishing features."
"One of them is norm conservation, which is called Parseval's theorem, and is an extension of Pythagoras' famous Orthonormality theorem to infinite dimensions."
"Then, we will see the Orthogonal Projection Theorem."
This is a powerful method to take a vector from possibly an infinite dimensional space and project it onto a subspace.
"Once we have this, we will consider some examples of approximations and orthonormal bases."
Modules 3.3 Hilbert Space and Approximation.
The overview of this submodule is the following.
"First, we look at the norm conservation, in particular Parseval's formula."
"Then, we look at the approximation by the projection method, and finally we explore a few examples."
"Parseval's theorem: we know that if we have a basis for space, any vector x can be written as a linear combination, summed from 0 to K-1, αk, wk."
"For an orthonormal basis, there is this beautiful formula which says that the squared norm of x, ||x|| squared is equal to the sum of the coefficents of expansion squared, or Parseval's formula."
Let us verify Parseval's formula on a simple example.
"We have the canonical basis E, e0 on e1, and we can write x as α0, e0, α1, e1."
"Let us look at the new basis, the blue one, which is given by v0 and v1."
"V0 is equal to cosθ sineθ transpose, v1 is minus sinθ cosθ transpose."
"And x can of course also be written as a linear combination of v0 and v1, namely, β0, v0, plus β1, v1."
"So his model is the Z electrons filled this volume, this sphere effectively of 10^-10 meters in diameter."
"The electrons filled that up, but somewhere in the center there is something that is very small and very massive that has a diameter of 10^-14 meters."
Because occasionally that alpha particle hit that massive part so most of the mass of the atom is in this nucleus.
"Now, isn't this a great UROP project for Mr. Marsden?"
What did he do?
He discovered the nucleus.
Fantastic.
I also want to tell you that this kind of Rutherford backscattering experiment here is also the basis of the experiment that was done to discover the quark.
"The quark which is the elementary particles that make up the proton, the neutron."
Same idea.
There is a high energy particle that comes into the proton and backscatters from the quark essentially.
"That is an experiment carried out by one of my colleagues in the Physics Department, Jerry Friedman and Henry"
Kendall.
Henry Kendall has since passed away.
But the same idea.
It's really the Rutherford backscattering experiment that was done.
All right.
"Well, now it is time for us to do our own Rutherford backscattering experiment."
"And the way we are going to do that is we're going to be scattering off of this lattice here, this lattice of these Styrofoam balls."
"These Styrofoam balls are gold atoms, gold nuclei, and then the space around them is where the electrons are."
So this is one monolayer of gold atoms.
"Now, this scale is a little wrong."
The real scale would be if we had a pinhead in the center of this room and then the rest of the room was the atom and then there would be another room 10-251 with a pinhead in the center of that.
"That's the real scale, but the fact that the scale isn't right, that's okay."
We are going to be able to understand the principle here.
And what we want to do is we want to be able to measure the diameter of these Styrofoam balls or the diameter of those gold nuclei.
And we're going to measure it by measuring the probability of backscattering.
"And the way we're going to measure the probability of backscattering, the way we are going to do that, is we're going to take these ping-pong balls, and they are going to be our alpha particles."
And we are going to aim them at the lattice.
"And we are going to have a total of 287 ping-pong balls, or 287 alpha particles."
"And so the probability of backscattering will be simply the number backscattered over the total number incident, which will be 287."
So this is what we are going to measure.
Sorry.
"It looks like I'm not going to get to it, actually."
Thank you.
"What I want you to notice here is that when r goes to infinity, what is the force going to do?"
Zero.
"When those two particles are infinitely far apart, you've got an infinity in the denominator, this force is zero, there is no attraction between them."
"But when r goes to zero, what does that force do?"
Infinity.
"When r is zero, there is an infinity large force."
"And in between, what is happening is that the closer the particles get to each other, the larger the force."
The more attraction there is.
The more they want to be even closer to each other.
All right.
"Now, what this equation is telling me is simply, what is the force of attraction between the nucleus in an electron for a fixed distance r?"
"In other words, if I were holding the electron and the nucleus in my hands at some distance r, that equation would tell me what the force was."
"And you can bet that in order to keep them apart, I would really have to be pulling like this."
You'd feel it.
"But you also know that if you let them go, what would happen is that they would move toward each other."
What this equation does not tell us is how they move toward each other.
It does not tell us how r changes with time.
It doesn't tell us anything about r as a function of time.
"Although we know the force law, we don't know anything from that force law about how those two particles move under influence of that force."
And so what we need is we need an equation of motion.
"And the equation of motion that was known at that time is, of course, Newton's equations of motion, Newtonian mechanics, classical mechanics, the mechanics that governs the motion of all bodies around us that we see easily and astronomical bodies."
"In particular,"
"Newton's second law, F equals ma, this force equals the mass of the particles times the acceleration."
"And, of course, in this acceleration term, well, I think you know what's in there."
"In that acceleration term,"
"let me just write it out, the acceleration then is the change in velocity with respect to time and the velocity is the change in the position r with respect to time."
So we have a second derivative here.
What is in this force law is a way to get r as a function of time under influence of this force.
So we take this force and we substitute it in here and we would be able to solve a differential equation for how those two bodies moved under influence of that force.
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
What was that again? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It's going to happen. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"Two last questions from me, and Vic did a great job on the panel on the mobile Internet a few moments ago."
Would you be willing to opine in your lifetime when mobile-related revenue search might surpass PC-based revenue?
Given that we now know where the future is going? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
It clearly will.
It's a question of the growth rate of data-capable mobile devices.
"The reason it clearly will is that the monetization of the ads should be higher, because they're even more targeted."
"So we have a lot of evidence, and Vic talks about this in his speeches, where when you have a powerful browser, whether it's the I-Phone, is a good example, the Blackberry now has one, obviously the Android phones, as they come out."
"People spend many, many more searches when they finally have a capable browser."
"And so one of the things, one of the questions is what's new in the technology sense, as opposed to the financial market sense, and the development of this new, open source browser that all these things are based on, really does create that first step of a whole new platform."
So how long does it take?
"The answer is, a few years."
But not a few decades. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
"One last question from me, and then I'll turn it over to others."
You have been a great partner with your revenue-sharing agreements with thousands or millions of other players.
"You don't necessarily get the credit for it that, in my humble opinion, you should."
But you're offering those sorts of compelling deals to content providers.
You're offering an Android operating system to the mobile device market.
"And this goes back, it's the same question, slightly differently, do those offers become more compelling to standouts in the next six to 12 months than they have been in the past? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Do you mean people who have previously said no? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
Yep.
Yep. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, I think one of the first principles of business is that they say no this year and maybe they'll say yes next year."
We're working really hard to create ecosystems that have enough differentiation and enough innovation that people want to play in them.
"And we're also trying to do business terms that are non-exclusive, so that everybody has access to it."
So there's certainly no prohibition from people doing it.
"In the Android case, it was discussed at the 3GSM conference that there are quite a few partners that have pre-announced their intent to offer Android-based devices of one kind--and some of these things look like phones but some of them are, in fact, not phones."
"And that obviously, then, creates the cycle for more applications."
And that'll bring more people to the party.
"I think people in the room here understand how platform businesses work, and it's fundamentally about momentum."
Photovoltaic on rooftops.
"There will also be, within the structure itself, a composite material."
And when the sun is out the structure moves.
That they call pressure transducers.
They generate electricity by expansion and contraction.
"So all the roadways, all the rooftops are not only photovoltaic, but they are heat concentrators."
"In regions where you have natural volcanic energy, you use the heat of volcanos to boil water and turn turbines."
"And there is enough volcanic energy to propel the Earth for thousands of years, just that alone, if we develop it."
"Harnessing the Gulf Stream, these waters move under the ocean."
"There are cold water streams, there are hot water streams, moving in different directions."
We can harness them by putting a turbine in there.
There are thousands of different ways of generating electricity.
"You don't need oil or gasoline or coal, these are filthy ways."
There is very little waste in the future.
"Today we manufacture things to wear out and breakdown so you have piles of television sets, computers, and cell phones in the junkyard."
Piles of it.
"In the future we design things that last, so you can just change a part very easily by plugging it in and pull out the transistor, put in another one."
It blinks and tells you where the problem is.
Your cell phone will repair itself when it can.
"In other words, the way a machine repairs itself, it has, say, three resistors or transistors, and when one fails the other one rotates and plugs in."
I think machines can do almost anything man can do except feel.
"Mr. Fresco has proposed innovative solutions to many of the environmental issues facing the world, such as the global shortage of clean, potable water."
"When it rains, we harness the water."
We direct the water to storage basins.
"Instead of floods, we build canals all across the world, in different countries."
"And those canals terminate the floodwaters into strip mining, where we dug big holes in the Earth."
We left these ugly places all over the world.
"In the future, we will store floodwaters there to be used at a later date."
We don't pour chlorine in the water.
Do you know that most embalming fluids are in all the reservoirs of all the big cities?
You can't put embalming fluid in dead people and not know that it doesn't go down into the ground and contaminate the water table.
"When you spray poisons on plants, it's very hard to wash those poisons off, because they do go inside the food you eat."
Call the number of copies M.
"That is, M, the number of copies, well this is the number of copies N raised to the D power."
"So now, we take the logarithm of both sides and here it doesn't matter what base the logarithm it's to, it will work if you do it Base 10, or Base 2, or the natural log, or whatever you want."
"We can take the log of both sides and then we can solve for D, and now we have our definition of dimension."
"D = log M / log N that is, dimension is the logarithm of the number of copies we get divided by the logarithm of how much we divided the sides by... how much we shrank the side."
Let's check this to make sure it works.
"We have D = log M / log N, and you can think of this as log Base 10 if you like."
"As I said, it doesn't matter what the base is."
"OK, to check it, for Dimension-1, we have the bisecting version where N is 2."
"That is, we divided each line into two equal halves, then M, the number of copies, was two."
"And so D equals log two divided by log two, which equals one (D = log 2/log 2 = 1), so that works because that gives us the dimension, Dimension-1."
"So, for the trisecting version, similarly, we had N equals three (N=3), and we divided the side into three equal parts, and"
"M, the number of copies, was three (M=3), so D equals log three over log three, which again equals one (D = log 3/log 3 = 1), so our formula works for 1-dimensional objects."
"OK, for 2-dimensional objects, we have a similar kind of check, where we have for bisecting we have dimension equals log four divided by log two which you can check is two (D = log 4/log 2 = 2)."
You can check that on your calculator if you like.
"And for trisecting, N equals three (N=3), M equals nine (M=9), and"
"D equals log nine over log three, which is also equal to two (D = log 9/log 3 = 2)."
"Finally, for Dimension-3...well, I'll let you check that, but I promise you it works."
"Now all of this has been building up to what we really want to do, which is to calculate the dimension of the Koch Curve."
"So, if you remember, for the Koch Curve we draw a segment, then we erase its middle third, and then we draw an angle to replace that middle third by an angle whose sides are the same length as the other two sides."
"That is, 1/3 the length of the original segment."
"Then we iterate that, again and again, until we finally come up with something that looks something like this."
And we can keep going as long as we want.
"So for the Koch Curve, N here equals three (N=3) ."
"That is, remember we're reducing the size of the segments by a factor of three (3)."
"M, the number of copies of the original, is four (M=4)."
"At each level, we replace the original with four copies arrayed in this configuration."
"So according to our definition, our dimension D is equal to log of four divided by log three--that is log M divided by log N--which is approximately 1.26 (D = log 4/log 3 = log M/log N = 1.26)."
What exactly does this mean?
"Well, for one thing, it means that the dimension of this curve approximates 1.26."
It gets closer and closer to 1.26 as we iterate it through more levels.
But what does the 1.26 mean?
"So this is what we called earlier R1 and we called this earlier R2, it is the distance to that point very far away."
If I want to know what R2
- R1 is that's very easy now.
I draw a line from here perpendicular to this line and you see immediately that this distance here is R2 - R1.
"But that distance is also -- you realize that this angle is theta -- it's the same one as that one, so that distance here is also D sine theta."
"And so now I'm in business, I can predict in what directions we will see constructive interference."
"Because all we are demanding now, requesting, that R2 - R1 is N times lambda."
"And so we need that D sine theta and I'll give it a subindex N, as in Nancy, equals N times lambda."
In others words that the sine of theta N is simply N lambda divided by D.
"And that uniquely defines all those directions, the whole zoo of directions N equals 0, that is the center"
"line, N equals 1, N equals 2,"
"N equals 3, and so on."
And then I have the whole family of destructive interference.
Which would require that lambda
R2 - R1 which is D sine theta must now be 2N +1 times lambda/2.
Just as we had it on the blackboard there.
We discussed that earlier.
And so that requires then that the sine of theta N for the destructive interference is going to be 2N+1 times lambda / 2D.
So this indicates the directions where we expect maxima and where we expect minima as seen from the center between the two sources.
But now I would like to know what the linear distance is if I project this onto a screen which is very far away.
"And so let us have a screen at a distance capital L which has to be very far away, so here are now the two sources."
It's a different scale.
And here is a screen.
And the distance b- from the two sources to the screen is capital L. And here is one of those direction theta.
And you see immediately that if
"I call this the direction X, X being 0 here, that the tangent of theta is X/L."
"If but only if I deal with small angles, the tangent of theta is the same as the sine of theta."
"And therefore I can now tell you where the maxima will lie on that screen, away from the center line, which I call 0, that is now when X of N is L times the sine of theta, in small angle approximation."
"So this is approximately L times N lambda divided by D, and for the same reason you will get here c- destructive interference when X of N is going to be L times 2N+ 1 times lambda / 2D."
That is simple geometry.
So now we have all the ingredients here on the blackboard and I'm going to
leave it there for the rest of the lecture.

You're talking about yourself and you're doing this in front of two evaluators that you don't know and that it's also going to be recorded and looked at by other people down the road.
So there is a whole bunch of evaluation here.
The evaluators are members of our research team.
So they're going to be watching you and scoring you while you're speaking.
"And the whole time that they're there, they're giving people this negative non-verbal feedback."
"And so they're sitting there very stoically, having no emotions, no facial expressions, frowning, furrowing your brow, they're not nodding, they're not smiling."
"So you can imagine, public speaking isn't so great to start with, then we're getting this negative non-verbal feedback."
What is wrong with me?
What am I doing that's so wrong and their response kind of amps up.
So we see a really strong threat response from this task usually.
Operators are here monitoring physiological signals as they come in real time.
And we now have another task for you to try to evaluate your ability to think on your feet.
"For this task, what we would like for you to do is count backwards, aloud, starting from number 996 in steps of 7."
This is something that participants don't know about until it's kind of thrust on them right then in the moment.
957?
I'm not sure that was right.
"And when you get one wrong, they tell you, ""I'm sorry that was incorrect."
"Please go back to the beginning""."
I'm not sure that was right.
"Please start back at the beginning, 996."
The take home from this whole line of research we've been trying to tell people is that stress isn't bad.
"The responses in our body, the stress responses can actually positively predict cognitive performance."
So people have the higher stresses or the higher amounts of arousal actually do better on their tests than people who don't.
"So when you do need that arousal, when you do need to make some instrumental response, the body's stress response is actually going to help you make those responses better or help you do something better."

"When a histogram filter was discrete distribution was defined over a finite set of bins, whereas the common filter had a continuous state space."
"Halfway across the globe, and we're standing on new ground."
Screaming across the waves you can't hear a sound.
"There's no fair trials, no trade, no liberties."
No tea!
We've colonized America.
Let's see another example.
"Now, be careful here with this power of two."
We can not apply that to each of these two terms.
"What this means is (3y-5), (3y-5)."
"So again, we can FOlL."
"This is equal to the product of the first terms in the binomials, so 3y * 3y."
"And then, plus the product of the outer terms in the two binomials, so 3y * -five."
"And then plus the product of the inner terms in the two binomials, so -five * 3y."
"And then, plus the product of the last term in the two binomials, so -five * -five which is equal to 9y^2 - 15y - 15y + 25."
And combining the outer and inner terms gives us our answer of 9y^2 - 30y + 25.
"Now again, this is a common type of multiplication here where we're multiplying a binomial by itself."
And there's a special formula again in this type of case.
And the formula is that (A-B)^2 = A^2 - 2AB + B^2.
"That is the outer and inner terms are the same, so there'll be two of them."
"Which we just saw with A = 3y, and B = five."
"So, our answer here is A^2 or (3y)^2 - two * A * B, and then plus B^2, or 9y^2 - 30y + 25."
And this is how we multiply two binomials.
"Thank you, and we'll see you next time."
"Now we're going to succinctly talk about body fluid cleanup, from a potential bio-hazard."
"Now, when we do this, I'll tell you, one of the best things you can do actually, is have your scene set up first."
"I mean making sure you have extra pair of gloves already laid out, having your disposable wipes, having your premixed 1 to 10 household bleach solution,"
"One part bleach to ten parts water, which is suggested by the Centers for Disease Control for a disinfecting household solution, if you don't have a commercial virucidal, or another disinfecting solution."
"The goal here, now, is to obviously disinfect the surface, this could be applied to tools or other inanimate objects as well, but in this case it's a table top."
"Somebody had a bloody nose, a child or an adult, they bled on the table, and now we're coming in later to disinfect this."
"In the meantime, if you notice there's a blood-spill, and you can't disinfect right away, block off the area so that other people don't come in contact with it, and become infected as well, or at least exposed."
So first is to actually clean up as much of the gross contaminate as possible.
We're gonna do this by wiping the bulk of the contaminate off the table.
"If you can have someone assist you by bringing the bag in, we're going to dispose of the contaminate in a bio-haz bag, being careful not to cross-contaminate."
"Now, if we're working with a clean bottle, and we've just wiped up contaminate,"
I mean I can get this contamination on these gloves pretty easily.
"Let's remove the first contaminated gloves without snapping or popping the gloves, with a glove-on-glove, skin-on-skin, removal procedure."
"Now we're gonna be careful, and actually drop those into the bio-haz bag as well."
"And it's the expected value of e, to the s transpose x."
"Okay, and this is equal to e to the s, transpose mu, plus a half s transpose sigma s."
"Now, you're probably familiar with this in the 1 dimensional case, we'll just recover here."
"Suppose x is really just a scale of random variable, then the moment generating function of x is equal to the expected value of e to the sx, and it's equal to e to the s mu plus the half sigma squared s squared."
And this is the case where x is normal with mean mu and variance sigma squared.
So this is the moment generating function of the scalar.
Normal random variable.
"This is, it's generalization to a multivariate normal random vector, x."
Okay.
"So, we call our partition we saw in an earlier module."
We can break x into two blocks of vectors x1 and x2 as such.
"We can extend this notation, notation naturally."
"So we can write Mu equals 1 2, and equals to This sigma 11, sigma 12, sigma 21, sigma 22 and they are the mean vector and covariance matrix of x1, x2."
So we have the following results on the marginal conditional distributions of x.
The marginal distribution of a multivariate normal random variable is itself normal.
In particular the marginal.
Distribution of Xi is multivariate normal with mean vector Ui and variance covariance matrix sigma Ii.
"So for example X1 is multivariate normal, in fact it's k components, mu 1, sigman 1, 1."
And similarly X2 is multivariate normal.
"Mu 2, sigma 2, 2, and this is n minus k components."
"And we have here an example of the bi-variance normal density function, where the correlation beween x1 and x2 is 80%."
If we rotate the service you can see the correlation of 80 percent the large values of X 1 are associated with values of x 2
like all values of x 1 are related to all values of x 2.
So we can also talk about the conditional distribution assuming sigma is positive definite.
The conditional distribution of the multivariate normal distribution is also multivariate normal.
"In particular x 2, given that x 1 equals little x 1 is multivariate normal with mean vector mu 2.1."
"In the variance, covariance matrix, sigma 2.1."
"Where mu 2 1, is given to us by this expression here, and sigma 2.1 is given to us by this expression here."
"And we can get some intuition for this result, by just imaging the following situation; so we've got X one down here."
"We have X two over here, and imagine we plot some points from X one and X two if you like, we generate X one and X two from some distribution, from the bivariate normal distribution, in particular."
"So the mean of X one is, let's say mew one and the mean of X two is mew two."
Okay.
"Now, there is no formula about where to put any of these sliders, but in general, you want the radius slider to be less than 2.0."
"In this case, I'm going to drag it over to the"
"left until I see a lot of that glow disappear, and I'm gonna take it down pretty far, maybe 2.6."
And then I'm gonna go back up to the Amount Slider.
And I'll move that back over to the left until I just like the amount of sharpening.
And as
"I said, there is no perfect number and it's different on every image."
This is really a subjective decision.
"But you do wanna be careful not to over sharpen at this capture stage because as I said, later you will be sharpening again when you output a copy of this photo."
In this case I'm gonna bring that all the way down to around 50.
"There are two more sliders here, the Detail slider and the Mask slider."
The Detail slider determines which edges are being sharpened.
If I drag the
"Detail slider to the right, more edges get sharpened."
"And if I drag it to the left, fewer edges get sharpened, Now that's a little bit difficult to see, so, I wanna show you a kind of a map of which edges are being sharpened here as I drag the"
"Detail slider and I can do that by holding down the Option key on the Mac or the Alt key on a PC, and dragging that detail slider over to the right, and now you can see what's being sharpened."
"If I go in the other direction, you can see that fewer details are being sharpened."
So I'm gonna release the option or Alt key to go back and view the image and I'm just going to drag the detail slider to taste until the sharpening looks right to me.
"Now by dragging the Detail slider over to the right I've manage to sharpen lots of fine details including some that I really don't want to sharpen, here in the background in the hills and a little bit in the sky as well."
And in that case I can use the Masking slider to protect areas that really aren't edges from sharpening.
"Again, I'm going to hold down the Option key or the Alt key in the PC as I drag the Masking slider to the right."
And this is showing which parts of the image are being sharpened- the white parts.
And as I drag the Masking slider over to the right.
The parts that are turning black are being protected from sharpening.
"So, I'm protecting the sky and some of those hills in the background as well."
I'll release the Option or Alt key so I can see my image again.
And then I can tweak that masking slider while I'm
"looking at the image, maybe I'll drag it back a little bit."
"As I said, there really are no formulas."
"But in general, if I'm working on a scenic image like this, an image with a lot of fine detail, I will increase the Detail slider quite a bit and"
I may not have any masking.
"If I do, it will be fairly low."
"But if you use a design that other people have tried and you can just get some recommendations, it tends to work better and have less problems."
"So now, we have the don'ts."
"The first don't is, they're very common error, don't store Greywater."
"If you store it, it has nutrients in it, it has, you know, little pieces of gunk and stuff, it will start to break down and it'll basically start to smell very bad."
So you don't ever want to have it in a container and store it for later.
"You also use--make Greywater everyday, so there's no reason, practical reason to store it."
"You don't want to have a filter that you have to actually manually clean because that's just a point of failure, people forget to clean things if you need to have regular maintenance, so that's a not a good idea."
You don't want to use it if you're near a creek or a river.
It has nutrients in it and those nutrients can actually pollute.
It's like a fertilizer.
"So if that gets into the water, it will cause algae to grow and rob the creek or river of oxygen."
So some sites are just not appropriate for Greywater.
And you also don't want to use it if you don't have very good drainage on your site because you never want to have pooling of Greywater or running off.
You need to make sure it can soak properly into the ground to irrigate plants.
And so the next thing: mulch basin.
Who's heard of a mulch basin?
Got one person?
"Yeah, this is kind of a common-ish landscaping technique to be water-conserving."
"It's making, putting mulch around trees."
It lets--so what you do with the mulch basin is you go to the drip line of the tree and you remove some soil kind of like a doughnut ring of soil removed and you fill it up with woodchips instead.
"And this allows--with Greywater when you are going to irrigate with Greywater, it goes into that mulch basin."
It can spread out through all those woodchips.
It gets actually kind of filtered in the woodchips naturally and it soaks down into the ground and you never see it into some pool or run off.
It's just going underground and irrigating.
So it's probably the most important piece of a Greywater
System.
"And it's not often spoken of because it's, you know, out in the landscape."
It's not a pipe; it's not a plumbing part; it's something you do to your landscape.
But it's really important to have a well-functioning Greywater System.
"And so, as that Greywater goes into the landscape, the other really critical thing is something that you don't really see."
It's the billions of microscopic soil bacteria that are in the soil.
"They're consuming nutrients; they're taking any kind of gunky, dirty whatever is in your Greywater and turning it into plant nutrients."
The other kinds of effects of climate change -- this is coral bleaching.
"It's a beautiful picture, right?"
All that white coral.
Except it's supposed to be brown.
"What happens is that the corals are a symbiosis, and they have these little algal cells that live inside them."
"And the algae give the corals sugar, and the corals give the algae nutrients and protection."
"But when it gets too hot, the algae can't make the sugar."
"The corals say, ""You cheated."
"You didn't pay your rent."""
"They kick them out, and then they die."
"Not all of them die; some of them survive, some more are surviving, but it's really bad news."
"To try and give you a sense of this, imagine you go camping in July somewhere in Europe or in North America, and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you, and you see that 80 percent of the trees, as far as you can see, have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked."
"And you come home, and you discover that 80 percent of all the trees in North America and in Europe have dropped their leaves."
"And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,"
"""Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."""
"Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean during the 1998 El Nino, an area vastly greater than the size of North America and Europe, when 80 percent of all the corals bleached and a quarter of them died."
"And then the really scary thing about all of this -- the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change -- is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum."
"But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks, the synergies among them that make the whole vastly greater than the sum of the parts."
"And the great scientific challenge for people like me in thinking about all this, is do we know how to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?"
"I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it."
But what does that mean?
We really don't know.
So what are the oceans going to be like in 20 or 50 years?
"Well, there won't be any fish except for minnows, and the water will be pretty dirty, and all those kinds of things and full of mercury, etc., etc."
"And dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they'll start to merge, and we can imagine something like the dead-zonification of the global, coastal ocean."
"Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it, because it would be a kind of gastronomic Russian roulette."
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom; sometimes you don't.
That doesn't sell.
"The really scary things though are the physical, chemical, oceanographic things that are happening."
"As the surface of the ocean gets warmer, the water is lighter when it's warmer, it becomes harder and harder to turn the ocean over."
We say it becomes more strongly stratified.
"The consequence of that is that all those nutrients that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries, of the sardines of California or in Peru or whatever, those slow down and those fisheries collapse."

"If Allah give us the lives, we will see each other again, salam alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu.  have a good night"
Let's look at some of the options you can use with replica sets.
"The config we used earlier, we didn't use any options, we just used the defaults."
"And as you saw, that worked pretty well."
"But there are some options available for your use, so"
let's go through some of those.
"So, if we look at the configuration we used before, we'll see here we basically just have the host names we want to use."
"They have ordinal IDs, the name of the set, and that's basically it."
"This version field is added by the server, and it will just keep track of changes to the configuration and increment the version on each change, so that we can notice changes, and helps the different members the set know if they have the latest version of the config or not."
"They talk to each other, and if someone else has a newer version, they will grab it, then."
"So, for example, you can do re-configurations when a member is down."
"So, a set has a configuration, we might want to change it, right?"
"Something's changed, new server, new replication factor, whatever."
We may want to change.
"That can be done, of course."
"So if you imagine we had a set, we'll just go with the case where there's three servers again, which is the common case, and they're all running, it's all fine."
"Maybe something like this, primary, secondary, secondary."
We're running along.
Imagine the server goes down.
"Even with the server down, we can still do a reconfiguration of the set."
"To do a reconfigure of the set requires that the majority of the members of the set, of the voters, are up."
"So, we have a majority."
"We have one, two out of three."
"So that's a majority, proper majority, so we can do it."
"And what we'll do is we'll use the replSetReconfig command, which has helpers."
"For example, rs.reconfig in the shell is a helper."
"But you will send that command to the primary of the set, and if a majority of the set is up, you will have a primary, and then you can do that."
"So, if we consider now a reconfiguration occurring on the set, and we were on, say, V1 of the set's config, and everyone has a local copy of that in local.system.replSet collection, if the set's been initiated, they'll have that."
"So that document's currently on version colon one, which,"
"Just like we said there's a set of pizza and movies, all of which leave you indifferent."
How do you decide which pizza and movies to choose?
"Well, you bring in the relative price of pizza and movies."
"Here, we're going to bring in the relative price of capital and labor to determine how we choose between capital and labor."
"So to do that, we're going to draw isocost lines which are going to be just like our old budget constraints."
"Isocost lines which represent the cost of different combinations of inputs, just like our old budget constraint represented the cost of different consumption goods."
"So if you look at figure 9-1, here we're going to have isocost curves which are going to represent-- and we're going to assume here that the wage is $5 an hour, and the rental rate is $10 per unit of capital."
"So, in other words, the $50 isocost line in figure 9-1 shows all combinations of labor and capital that cost $50."
"So you could spend $50 in production if you had 10 units of labor, and no units of capital."
"Or five units of capital, and no units of labor, or any combination in between."
These are all the combinations of labor and capital that cost $50.
"Likewise, the $100 isocost is all combinations of labor and capital that cost $100."
So each of these isocosts give you the combination of inputs that cost a certain amount.
Just like a budget constraint gave you the combination of pizza and movies on which you spent your income.
"Now, you may have said well, wait a second, the difference with consumers is we knew their income so we knew what their budget constraint is."
"Here we don't know whether to choose the $50 cost, the $100 cost, $150."
We don't know what the total amount is.
"That's what makes firms hard, that's why we have an extra step."
"So hold that thought, we'll come back to that next lecture."
"For now, let's just say there's a set of trade-offs that the firm can choose from, and a set of isoquants that they have."
And what's the slope of this isocost line?
It's the negative of the wage rental ratio.
The slope of the isocost is minus w over r.
The slope is minus w over r.
"It's basically the trade-off between labor and capital's going to be determined by the relative prices of those inputs, so slope is going to be minus w over r."
"So basically, how many units of capital do you have to give up to get the next unit of labor?"
"Well, what this isocost tells you is you have to give up 1/2 a unit of capital to get a unit of labor."
So the slope is minus 1/2.
"Likewise, you could say you have to give up two units of"
labor to get one unit of capital.
"So that's why the slope is minus 1/2, that's what it's telling us."
"Once again, budget constraints are about opportunity costs."
"I can expect that maybe a lot a lot of this will get better in the future, but as of right now, it's really not the ideal viewing situation for those of us who are trying to engage our audience and trying to, and trying to interact with them and illicit feedback and all that kind of stuff."

I started working with a boy who had just got expelled from school.
He had an interest in computers and at my office I noticed that there was a few lying around that nobody was using.
I got it to this kid and it completely turned things around for him.
Since that time we have been able to help thousands of people.
Eighty percent of the people that get a computer system from us have never had one before.
It's the ability to do a job search.
It's the ability to write a resume.
It's the ability to have access to the internet.
"By donating their equipment, local businesses and individuals get to be a part of that."
So many times a business or organization will spend thousands of dollars to get rid of their computer equipment.
For us we pick it up at no charge.
All those chemicals don't end up polluting the environment and the best part of being it gets to someone whos never had anything.
As this program has evolved we have established relationships with local colleges.
"Its a good learning experience for student interns, and work study students and service learning students."
The mission of PCs for people is pretty simple.
We basically try to help provide some hope and opportunity for people.
I think it is important for people to have the opportunity that everyone else has.
It's the right thing to do.
Let's write 0.8 as a fraction.
So 0.8... the 8 right over here is in the tenths place.
It is the tenths place.
So you can read this as 8 tenths and we can write that literally as being equal to 8 tenths or 8 over 10.
"Essentially, we think that the slow diffusion of computers, which people were predicting should increase productivity as way back as the 1980s, suddenly in the 1990s it really happened."
And this IT revolution led to a big productivity increase.
"It's not clear if that's dying down now again, or if it's going to continue."
It'll be interesting to see what happens over the next 15 years.
"So we have this period of high productivity growth, slowed down from '73 to the early '90s and then picked up again."
"We're not quite clear if that year's coming to an end or not, but that's sort of where we are now in that time path."
"What's very interesting-- so that's what happens to productivity, that's all I'll talk about it for this course, it's more of a macro topic."
But I will mention an interesting micro spin on that.
"Which is, if society's more productive, that's like found money for society."
That's like saying with all our resources we suddenly get extra money.
Society then has to decide what to do with that.
The US and Europe have followed very different paths in what to do with that money.
"In the US, we've taken that money and bought a lot more stuff."
We have the highest standard of living in the world.
We buy the most stuff per capita of anyone the world.
"In Europe, they took a lot of that money and took more"
leisure with it.
"They decided we're not going to quite have as much stuff, but we're going to have six weeks a year of vacation instead of two weeks a year of vacation."
So if we go back to our discussion of what determines
"labor supply is the choice between leisure and consumption, and you think of the wage as the opportunity cost of leisure, well, what they've decided in Europe is to choose more along the leisure axis, and less along the consumption axis."
"In the US, we've chosen less among the leisure axis-- we work way harder than Europe-- but we have more stuff."
"And the question is, how do we feel about that choice?"
Has that been ultimately a welfare maximizing choice?
"Now an economist will say of course it's been, because it's a choice we made."
"Of course, it's been welfare maximizing."
"We talk about revealed preference, and people's choices reveal what they prefer."
"So our revealed preference, we just prefer stuff more and"
leisure less than Europe.
"But in fact, it's not clear that that is each individual's optimal choice."
"If a given individual says, look, I'd rather have less stuff and more time off, it may be hard to find the job that lets them do that."
"So while that may be the choice we've made as a society with our social institutions, that may not serve the interests of every individual in society."
And that's the kind of trade-off we need to think about.

"Before we can look at the paint, we have to undress it, what we call stripping the wax off."
"Now, if you guys remember back in the first episode when we cleaned the Audi R8 Blackbird, we talked about dish soap versus car soap."
"Now, 99% of the time, you want to use car soap."
Why?
Because you want to leave all the wax on the car.
"In this particular case, you actually want to use dish soap, because it removes all the wax, and then you can actually see what's going on in the paint."
"Stripping the wax is essential for paint correction and requires a little more than switching from soft car soap to strong dish soap, and of course, following the same steps as you normally would when cleaning your car."
Add a few squirts of dish soap to your clean wash bucket and/or foam gun.
Then rinse down the paint with hose water to remove the loose dirt.
"Next, use the foam gun or the wash mitt to apply the dish soap that will emulsify the wax, uncovering the paint beneath it."
"Once the car is completely washed, use your clay bar, along with the wash mitt and the dish soap as a"
"lubrication, and remove any contaminants that may remain embedded in the paint after the initial cleaning."
"Now, we can be sure the surface is uncovered, or what we call naked paint, so that we can see how bad the scratches really are without waxes or silicones hiding them."
"Now, that the car's been stripped, what I like to do is use my crazy tools here to inspect the paint at the microscopic level."
"What that does is it shows me what's going on and how bad the paint is, and it helps me approach it and fix it or repair it in the best and fastest way."
"Mind you, these may not be necessary for the weekend warrior, but I still think they're pretty cool."
All right.
"So the first thing I have here is an assortment of lights, and my favorite one is this Brinkmann Dual Xenon light."
"Now, what I do, is I use it by shining it right here on the quarter panel, and I can see any of the swirls that are present."
"Remember, we removed all the wax, so what I'm seeing is actually there."
This is a great tool for visualizing how bad the damage is.
The second little tool I like to use is my infrared thermometer.
"Now, what I do is I shine it at the paint."
"Right now, it's telling me it's 83.5 degrees."
"Now, anything under 100 degrees is usable, meaning I can actually work on the paint here."
"If it's above 100 degrees, it's too hot for me."
"So I'll let it cool down, or I'll put some water on it, or"
I'll pull it inside the garage.
"Now, the reason why you want it so cool is the products happen to flash, meaning they burn up too fast, and it reduces the rate of abrasion that you can use to fix the paint."
So this is a very useful tool to figure out what temperature you're at.
"Now, the most useful tool I have is the PosiTector paint depth gauge."
"And that's called an affordance, and that's not just in the real world, but also in the physical world."
All these various widgets have these physical properties that are baked into their visual design.
"When you look at one of these, you can very quickly infer how you are going to interact with it because of those properties."
"The way that the circle's slightly larger makes it seem grabbable, the way that it's brighter on one side implies that it's been sort of filled so it feels like a track that you can grab this thing and move it on."
"Seeing a check box, a square in the presence of one that has a check box, is going to convey that that one could also have a check box."
"On and off, literally writing it on the switch is going more towards the direction of writing your manual on top of it, but the visual design conveys what it does, the same with the button."
So these are all affordances.
"Basically, an affordance is implied physics from the visual appearance."
"Moving on to the third one, natural mapping."
So let's run a quick experiment on the audience.
Say we're looking at a stove.
"So the second dial, which burner does it control?"
"And silence, you don't know, because there's no way to figure it out."
"We could literally write the glyphs on top of it, that would help."
"But the thing is, writing your manual directly on the product is cheating."
Then what if it wears off?
"That's definitely one way of doing it, but it's not a natural mapping."
"A better Ul, and this is something that Alan Cooper"
"likes to talk about, is if the dials were in that same configuration as four things, then it just naturally affords which burner they control."
This is also always true of light switches.
"So light switches only are frustrating when they don't actually map in order to the lights in the room, and if they do map in order, you usually just flip the right one without even thinking about it."
"If they don't, then you start randomly hitting them to try to figure it out and getting frustrated."
So this is a natural mapping.
"Another example, controls in a car."
"I love this one, because it's actually two natural mappings at the same time."
"The first is it's directly below the window, so it's a sort of natural orientation to where the window is, and also the four controls map to the four windows in the car."
"Sometimes, these are placed on the center console, which is really weird."
So that's in the physical world.
"In terms of the virtual world, we have things like this where the Full Screen control has a natural mapping to the window becoming larger."
It's placed on the edge.
It seems to afford expanding.
"In this case, the Account Selector has a mapping to the window, because the account controls the window as a whole, not an individual tab."
"Just like here in this country if you have the money, you go-- you try doctor after doctor; hospital after hospital; drug after drug in order to find a cure."
"The family tried former lovers, former spouses of lovers, people he had dealings with in nearby villages."
They were on the fourth or fifth tribe and they were suspecting a woman in a village just to the north.
Ferdinand had taken some of her goods to the market to sell but he had given all the money back that he owed her.
"But before they got an answer about her, Ferdinand had died."
"So if they'd found the witch in time, they could have saved his life."
These stories show how witchcraft brings social conflicts the surface and resolves them openly.
"You confront the suspected witch; you apologized; you negotiate; you right the wrong; you pay the compensation, and you get better, hopefully."
"So, in this sense, witchcraft could be seen as a means of conflict resolution."
"And for all you future doctors, witchcraft does not contradict science complements it."
The Zande acknowledge that the pills that they take and the shots that they get the medical clinics work.
And they love them.
But they also know that medicine alone cannot cure a serious illness.
The medicine will only work if the witchcraft is withdrawn.
So they have to [inaudible] the social reason as well as the medical cause of the illness.
Or not just the medical cause of the illness.
They find and confront the wish or the person will get better.
Even educated Zande who understand biology and physiology can still believe in witchcraft just as many Western doctors can still believe in God.
"The biology and the physiology explain the how-- the mechanism-- but not the why no matter how good a scientist you are, you probably can't explain why a mutation occurs in one person rather than another."
"And you may have noticed that while explaining and healing, this belief system also allows people to blame other people for their misfortune."
This idea is not foreign to the United States.
"Where if you spill your hot coffee and it burns your thighs, you can blame it on the fast food store that sold you the coffee."
"In fact, there seems to be a tendency among us humans to blame someone else for our misfortunes."
Witchcraft is one way of doing that.
"But instead of blaming an institution, a government, a foreign people, a God or a devil, the Zande blame their neighbors."
People they know and interact with daily.
They can confront a suspected witch and resolve the problem face-to-face.
"The truth is, people are always doing things that make us mad."
They take the last parking spot.
They cut us off in traffic.
They get the last tickets to a concert or to a [inaudible] event.
They get a job we want.
"So, if the interval is zero, that means that the distance between the events in light-years, for example, is equal to the time separation in years, because that's--because this term has to be exactly equal to that term there, in order for them to subtract out and get zero."
And the c^(2) converts from light-years to years and back again.
"And so, what does that mean?"
"That means if you emit a photon at one event, that same photon can, if it's going in the right direction, be present at the second event."
"So, if you ride along with light you'll see both--you'll participate in both these events."
"So, you sit at event one."
You flash a light.
"You ride along with the expanding light waves from that event and you get to something one light-year away, exactly a year later."
"And so, if the second event is one light-year away in distance and a year later in time, that same photon will be present at the second event, as at the first event."
"So, things that have one of these intervals of zero are separated by an appropriate amount so that the same ray of light can participate in both of them."
"So, if the interval--let's keep that up there for a minute."
"If the interval is negative, what does that mean?"
The distance is less than the light travel time.
"So, the photon is already past the second event."
"So, if you were to emit a ray of light at event number one, it would have passed the second event by the time it occurred."
The photon has already gone by.
"And similarly, if the interval is positive, then the light photon hasn't reached event two--hasn't yet reached event two."
"Now, this is important, because this means that you can't communicate from event one to event two."
"So, if you're at event two, you don't know what happened at event one."
"Because even if you'd sent out a signal, a radio signal or whatever, it would not have reached you by the time event two takes place."
So you can't communicate from event one to event two.
"And similarly, you can't travel from event one and reach event two, because you'd have to go faster than the speed of light to do it."
"These kinds of intervals, these negative intervals, these are called time-like, because the time term is larger than the distance turn."
And these kinds of intervals are called space-like intervals.
And you can only travel or communicate over time-like intervals.
Yes?
Student:
What are these so-called events?
Professor Charles
Bailyn:
"So, they're events--you can think of them as points in space-time."
"So, they have a particular position in space and a particular point in time."
"So, the eight%, the higher returns, the more likely it is that you are jumping all over the place, like the stock market."
"So, if you want to be safer, what you have to do?"
"You have to lower the interest rate to say, four%."
"Put it in a bond issued by the government, in the long run, and you'll be safer."
But what will happen to the 2.59 million?
Do this exercise for yourself.
"Let's, after this class is over, use four percent instead of eight%."
And what will you see?
A dramatic drop in the amount of money that you have at the end.
"So, what, why am I emphasizing so much in one little problem?"
"Because that's what Finance's beauty is, you know."
"If you understand these problems inside out, and you know how to use the Excel spreadsheet to calculate the answer, you've arrived."
"So, if you use four%, what happens?"
You kind of get rid of your nervousness about risk.
But what happens to the amount of money you have?
"It'll drop dramatically, right?"
We know that.
We know the power of compounding.
"It helps when an interest rate goes up, it hurts when it goes down."
"So, having said that, if the interest rate is four%, you're going to suffer."
"What, what can you say about the eight%, four percent choice?"
Neither one is good or bad.
Neither one is good or bad.
"What's important is you have control over the four and the eight in the following sense, not that you can predict it but you, if you choose to put four percent in your calculations, it has to be matched by your investment strategy."
"So, if you are thinking you're going to earn eight percent and put it in the bank, especially today, and if this low interest rates go on, you're dreaming."
"You'll have closer to $400,000, if the bank is still there after 40 years, right?"
"So, so think"
like that.
"Everything is under your control and the beauty of markets is for most of us, we do not need to second guess what the interest rates are."
All we need to do is match our preferences of risk with our investment strategy and then not worry about it too much.
"Hi, wo shi"
"We now know what an oxidation state or and oxidation number is and what it means when things are oxidized or reduced and lets see how that actually happens in reactions so what we're going to study is this video is oxidation/reduction reactions and all that is a reaction where somebody is being oxidized, which means electroons are being taken away from them, and someone's being reduced, which means they are being handed electrons or they are taking electrons away from someone else, and sometimes this has been termed, because you have the red in reduction and you have the ox in oxidation an they switch them around and they call i it a redox reaction, and it sounds like a very fancy chemistry term but it just means a reaction where something is getting oxidized and if something is getting oxidized, something else is getting reduced, so lets study a bunch of them."
First of all the equality relation must be reflexive.
"This means that the relation holds of every term in the language for itself for all x, x = x."
Relation must also be symmetric.
"If two terms refer to the same thing, it does not matter which one we write in the equation, for all x is equals y implies y=x."
Finally the relation must be transitive.
If we believe that a = b refer to the same object and we believe that b and c refer to the same object then a and c must refer to the same object as well.
Let's see how we can use these properties to solve some problems of equality.
Suppose we know that b = a and we know that b = c.
Let's prove that a = c as well.
As usual we start our proof with our premises.
B = a and b = c.
We add our axioms for equality First reflexivity then symmetry and then transitivity.
Now we go to work on the proof.
"First, we use two applications of universal elimination on our symmetry axiom to derive the fact that b = a implies a = b."
I'm substituting b for x and a for y.
We then use implication elimination on line six and line one to produce a=b.
"We then use universal elimination again to instantiate the transitivity axiom this time with x replaced by a, y replaced by b and z replaced by c."
We can join the result on
"line seven with the premise on line two to, to derive the conjunction on line nine."
And finally we use implication elimination to derive our overall conclusion so it works as expected though it's a bit lengthy.
We'll see a so much faster way to solve problems like this in j ust a short while.
"This exercise test, of understanding of equality by asking you to prove the results, using the basic equality axioms."
"Let's have the vector valued function r of s and t is equal to-- well, x is going to be a function of s and t."
"So we'll just write it as x of s and t times the x unit vector, or i, plus y of s and t times the y unit factor, or j, plus x of s and t times the z unit vector, k."
"So given that we have this vector valued function, let's define or let's think about what it means to take the partial derivative of this vector valued function with respect to one of the parameters, s or t."
"I think it's going to be pretty natural, nothing completely bizarre here."
"We've taken partial derivatives of non-vector valued functions before, where we only vary one of the variables."
We only take it with respect to one variable.
You hold the other one constant.
We're going to do the exact same thing here.
And we've taken regular derivatives of vector valued functions.
"Apple versus PC, or even if you go back to 1999 with The Matrix, you remember that there was a pure white background."
You see it on TV all the time these days.
"It's an effect that makes things look professional, so if you have a spokesperson, kind of like the way this is right now, if you have a spokesperson, or talking, having a pure, white background really enhances the professionalism of the specific shot that you're doing."
"The one thing is, most websites, not all, but many, are white in background, so if you put a video with an infinite white background on top of the web page with a white background, it kind of"
"looks like the person is floating on the web page, so it's a really great way to look very professional."
"So, today I am going to show you kind of my secrets behind the scenes if you will."
"Some truth in advertising, I am doing this not in a studio, but in my apartment. so I am going to give you a little tour, how to set up, and hopefully I am not going to miss out on anything in terms of details."
"I'll also have this transcript below this blog post, and, so if you want to read you can read it, and I also list all of the materials that you're going to need all the equipment so that you can figure out exactly what you need to make this effect work."
"So, let's get started."
"Ok, basically a little behind the scenes."
"You can see that this is my apartment, and yeah it's the holidays as I am recording this."
This is actually a white screen.
Now what I did was purchase a white projection screen because I needed to be able to put it up and take it down.
"I didn't want this thing in my, you know, I didn't want to put a sheet there."
"Basically, this is a white screen that you can buy on Amazon for about $70."
I will provide all the details below.
"You could also use a white wall, a white piece of fabric, or even a, you know, kind of a bed sheet type of thing."
You could do that as well.
"I preferred this because there are no wrinkles, fabric you would have to iron, and it gets to be a pain."
"A white wall probably would work if you have the room to do a white wall, so you can see my walls are greenish in color, and they're not white."
"So, I got the screen."
The next thing you want to do is you have here the lights.
"Now, you can see that there are two sets of lights on this side, and then we have two on there."
"Those are the screen lights, and basically what you want to do is these shop lights are available at Home Depot or anywhere else, Amazon, wherever you want to buy it, and their shop lights, 13, I am sorry, 10-inch shop lights, they are available for $13."
The next thing is
"I have in here, sorry to blind you, these look like gigantic"
"CFLs because they are, so on both sides of the screen I have these four gigantic high, very high"
lumen daylight CFL bulbs.
"Basically, I would go with at least a 50 watt, 2300 lumen bulb."
"The one I am using is an 85 watt, 4800"
lumen bulb.
"What you want to do is make sure they are daylight, so you are looking at probably, you want to choose something that's"
Going perpendicular to the blackboard right through the middle.
The different R2 - R1 equals lambda would again give me constructive interference.
"That would be a hyperbola then, R2 - R1 equals"
"lambda, that would again be a maximum, and you can draw the same line on this side, and then R2 - R1 being 2 lambda again would be a maximum."
"And again, if this is three-dimensional, you can rotate it about this line and you get bowls."
"And so in between you're obviously going to get the minima, the destructive interference,"
"lambda divided by two, and then here you would have R2"
- R1 is 3/2 lambda.
"We call these lines where you kill each other, destructive interference, we call them nodal lines or in case you have a surface it's a nodal surface."
"And the maxima are sometimes also called antinodes, but I may also refer to them simply as maxima."
And so this is what we call an interference pattern.
"If you look right here between -- on the line between the two points, then you should be able to convince yourself that the linear separation here between two"
lines of maxima is one-half lambda.
Figure that out at home.
That's very easy.
Also the distance between these two yellow lines here right in between is one-half lambda.
And so that tells you then that the number of lines or surfaces which are maxima is very roughly 2D divided by one-half lambda.
"So this is the number of maxima, which is also the same roughly as the number of minima, is then approximately 2D divided by lambda."
"And so if you want more maxima, if you want more of these surfaces, you have a choice, you can make D larger or you can make the wavelength shorter."
"And if you make the wavelength shorter you can do that by increasing the frequency, if you had that control."
The first thing that I'm going to do is to make you see these nodal lines with a demonstration of water.
"We have here two sources that we can tap on the water and the distance between those two tappers, D, is 10 centimeters, so we're talking about water here."
"Uh, we will tap with a frequency of about 7 hertz and what you're going to see are very clear nodal lines, this is a two-dimensional surface, where the water doesn't move at all."
The mountains and the valleys arrive at the same time.
The water is never moving at all.
So let me make sure that you can see that well.
And so I have to change my -- my lights.
"I'll first turn it on, that may be the easiest."
Starts tapping already.
I can see the nodal lines very well.
So here you see the two tappers and here you see a line whereby the water is not moving at all.
At all moments in time it's standing still.
"This is what white light would have done, this is a two-slit interference pattern."
This is what red light would have done.
"Red light is a narrow bandwidth of wavelengths, well-defined black lines, light plus light give darkness, well-defined maxima, and the blue -- notice that the separation between the dark lines and therefore also the separation between the bright lines is substantially smaller."
Because blue light has a wavelength of about 4500 Angstroms and red light roughly 6500.
So there's a big difference.
"And so white light would then give you the superposition of all these colors, and so you don't really get a very nice interference pattern of dark areas and bright areas, because all the colors begin to overlap and each live a life of their own."
What I can do with sound and what I did with water and what I have done with laser light
I can also do with radio electromagnetic waves.
With radar -- we have a 10-gigahertz transmitter here that we have used earlier in this course.
And so I will now show you that with radar you can also show interference patterns and the calculation that you see there are absolutely identical.
"The only thing I want to remind you of, that the approximation when you know capital L that the tangent theta is roughly the same as the sine of theta is only true for small angles."
"5 degrees is fine, 10 degrees is fine, but by the time that you reach 50, 60 or 70 degrees that approximation is not true."
So then you really have to take the tangent of theta.
"That's no problem because you first calculate what theta is, because that equation is correct, and then you can calculate always where X is, but then you use the tangent and not the sine."
So these are approximations which hold for small angles.
"And so if now we look at a 10-gigahertz transmitter, that means we have two transmitters, one here and one here."
And their separation D is 23 centimeters.
You see them here.
This is where they are.
"Here's one and here's the other, 23 centimeters apart."
At 10 gigahertz the wavelength is 3 centimeters.
You can confirm that.
The speed is speed of light.
Lambda is the speed of light divided by frequency.
That gives you the wavelength.
And we have here at a distance
"L which is 120 centimeters, we have here a receiver and a track, so this is X equals 0 and here we can move it along X and so you can calculate now at what angles seen from this point there will be a maximum there."
Theta 0 is obvious.
Right here there will be a maximum.
"The two waves, the distance between them is zero, R2 - R1 is 0."
So they will constructively interfere.
"But there is another angle, theta 1, for which again there will be constructive interference."
"I see a lot of people doing this, recognizing a failure in my position of the text there."
A bunch of scientists at the beginning of the last century wanted to figure this out.
"They were a bunch of Germans, they wanted to figure out how to order things and group things, and how we do that."
"They call this idea of order, they considered it order or rightness, they called it gestalt."
Here's an example of some gestalt principles at work.
You can see here how some very simple changes in the structure of the data make it so much easier to process on the right.
"Alex talked about these hierarchies of information and how, since we can't change the algorithms in people's brains, we have to speed things up by structuring the data."
"Well, these gestalt principles are how we structure the data."
"Now, I'm not going to go through all of the principles here."
"I'd recommend that you read the Wikipedia article on the topic, it's great."
I could have just read it and done well.
But I've distilled some of these ideas into two practical principles that you can put to work immediately when you're evaluating designs.
Here's the first one.
This is the thing that I wish that people had told me on the very first day of design school.
It's line stuff up.
That's it.
Everything should be lined up with something unless it has a good reason not to.
"So even if elements are at the very opposite sides of the screen and they're almost aligned, line them up."
"If we don't do it, then our subconscious brains are spending precious cycles trying to figure out, why are those things not lined up?"
Does it mean something?
Does it not mean something?
"It's almost like I'd compare it to a memory leak in your software, where something's going on, you're not exactly sure, but you're wasting your resources."
Let's line that back up.
That's better.
"So even stuff that isn't on the same screen, let's say three or four screens later, you've got something that's maybe in this case, a little bit above halfway down the page."
Line it up.
"Even though it doesn't seem like people will be able to make that association, and consciously they certainly won't, our visual processing systems are using that information to know how to decode this."
"Now I might also point out, if you do want to bring emphasis to something, then not lining it up is a really great way to do it."
You can see in these suggested paragraphs right here how just pulling one line out of alignment gives you a bunch of information about what's the most important and a lot of structure.
Here's the second big idea.
Design the spaces.
"Now, this is a little bit hard to do because again, our conscious brain is really good at examining objects in the foreground."
Photoshop.
"So here at the capture sharpening stage you can often just stick with the defaults but if you do want a photo to look sharper here on your screen at this stage, here's how to work with the detail panel's sharpening controls."
The first thing you wanna do is set up your previews.
"You have your preview of your sharpening -a live preview, here at the top of the digital panel."
"And if you don't see it, you can click this black triangle to open the Preview area."
I can set this
Preview to any part of the photo by clicking on the target and then clicking on the area of the photo that I wanna see in this preview.
And I can even come in and Click and Drag to move that around.
"By default, this small preview is set to one-"
-to-one view.
And that's really important because you cannot accurately preview sharpening unless you're viewing the photo at one-to-one.
And that's also true in the other preview that you have which is out in the Image Window.
Your Image Window has to be set to one-to-one view as well in order for you to judge your sharpening here.
"So, I'm gonna go up to the Navigator panel and I'll click the One-to-One button there."
And then I'll use this small square in the Navigator panel to drag the image in the image window to the part of the photo that I wanna see as I'm sharpening.
"Now, let's talk about what sharpening does."
Sharpening looks for edges in a photo.
"The edges between dark and light tones, like this edge here at the corner of the building."
"And then when you sharpen, that adds light pixels on one side of the edge and dark pixels on the other, those are called Sharpening Halos."
These halos increased contrast at the edges and that creates the illusion of sharpness.
"To see that better, I'm gonna go over to the sharpening settings and I'm gonna drag the amount slider way over to the right."
"And, then I'm also going to zoom in, I normally wouldn't do this when I'm sharpening but I want you to see that along that edge, there are some white pixels and along the other side of the edge, some dark pixels."
And those are the halos I just mentioned that create the illusion of sharpness.
"This amount slider determines the strength of sharpening, how brighter, how dark the sharpening halos are."
"The next slider, the Radius slider determines the thickness or spread of the sharpening halos."
"How far out from an edge a sharpening effect extends so you can see that if I drag the Radius slider to the right keeping your eye on these halos, they're going to move out from that edge as I increase radius."
"And if I decrease radius, those halos go back in toward the edge."
"Now if the Radius slider is up too high, you're gonna see a kind of a ghostly glow on the edge of the building when I go back in to a one-to-one view."
I'm gonna do that now.
Coming up to the Navigator panel and clicking One-to-One.
So you can see I've still got that glow along the edge of the building and that means that my Radius slider is up too high.
"So, I'm gonna drag it down."
"So anyway, that's sort of what I wanted to say on productivity."
"Yeah, question?"
AUDlENCE:
"Does higher productivity translate into more income, or more income for individuals who will buy stuff [INAUDlBLE] taking more leisure?"
JON GRUBER:
Because basically the point is think of our economy as a pie.
"That basically the idea is let's think of you have a start up, and your start up is such that you can make this product, and you could make $1 million a year with 10 workers."
You could make $1 million worth of stuff with 10 workers.
"So each of your workers takes home $100,000."
"Now imagine that you discover new technology which lets you, with the same amount of workers, make $2 million a year."
"Well, some of that you'll keep, but some of it you'll pay your workers more."
"So suddenly they have more money, because you've suddenly managed to make twice as valuable stuff with the same amount of resources."
So that's the situation which improves our standard of living.
Other questions about that?
Comments?
"OK, so the bottom line, coming back to sort of micro-theory we're talking about, is we have to think about production functions as having a productivity adjustment."
"Macro raises these big issues about sort of ultimately what determines our standard of living in this country, and how do we want to spend that money?"
"So, with that as background, we're now going to stop talking about production and move on to cost."
Cost is-- quite frankly this is perhaps my least favorite thing in the whole course.
"It's a little bit boring, but you need to understand how cost structure in a firm works to understand how firms make the decisions that ultimately get to be a lot more interesting again, so just sort of bear with me."
"Now, so we talked about costs, let's start with a couple of definitions."
"Basically, let's back up, where are we coming from?"
"I talked about what the firm's decision is, the firm has to maximize profits, which is revenues minus cost."
So we have to ask what are costs if we're going to make this profit maximizing decision.
"Well, costs are going to have a few components."
"The first component, costs are going to have really two major components-- fixed costs, and variable costs."
Fixed costs and variable costs.
Fixed costs are the costs of inputs that cannot be varied in the short-run.
"Remember, I said that the short-run is defined as a period over time which only some inputs can vary."
"Well, fixed costs are the costs of those inputs that can't vary in the short-run."
"Variable costs-- so that's like capital in the short-run-- variable costs are the cost of goods that can vary in the short run, that's like labor."
"So total costs is the sum of these two, so total costs equals fixed cost plus variable cost."
"When Einstein introduced the wormhole into his equations... he didn't think that anyone... could ever walk through one of these things... because, after all, you die in the process."
"Impossible as it may sound, experts think there may be... a way to travel through a wormhole... and live to tell about it."
"In principle, you can go right through... to another parallel universe."
If you go through again... you wind up on yet another parallel universe.
And if you go again and again and again... you wind up on repeated parallel universes.
"It's like going into an elevator and hitting the ""up"" button."
Each floor looks like a universe.
"Once again, however, there is a major drawback."
One problem is you don't know where you're going to wind up.
You'll wind up in a middle of a star... wind up in the middle of a planet.
It may ultimately prove impossible for individuals... to pass through a portal to a parallel universe... but there may be another way to save humankind.
"If the gateway is very small, like, for example, atomic in size... perhaps what we should do is send a seed, a nanobot... a microscopic robot through the gateway... containing the DNA, containing all the information... necessary to create a new civilization on the other side of the universe."
Where do we see that in nature?
Think of a tree.
A tree creates a seed.
The seed contains the DNA that it shoots out in all directions... capable of creating a new tree.
"The idea is that if an advanced civilization... in the future could assemble enough high-energy laser beams... they could, in theory, burn a hole in the fabric of space-time."
It's very difficult.
But we physicists have calculated that if you concentrate... enormous energy at a single point... to attain something called the Planck energy... the ultimate energy... space and time itself become unstable.
Little bubbles begin to form...
little bubbles that are perhaps portals... gateways to another universe.
"In this way, a microscopic pod or nanobot... containing humanity's DNA and the cosmic code of our world... can be transported to a parallel universe."
Faced with extinction... this could be humanity's last great hope.
"If we can't do it, it means the death of the universe."
"But if this incredible feat is achieved... our entire universe would be resurrected... and, like a phoenix, rise from the ashes."
"In other words, you are playing God."
This fantastic idea...
like the replay button on the universal iPod... could reset the cosmic concerto of human history... back to the beginning.
At least some kinds almost certainly exist.
Maybe the other kinds exist as well.
We just don't know.
"Only then, perhaps, will we be certain that there are parallel universes."
"So this is some member of Rn, you want to construct this vector."
"Well, the linear combination that would get you this is"
literally a1 times e1 plus a2 times e2 plus all the way to an times en.
This scalar times this first column vector will essentially just get you-- what will this look like?
This will look like a1 and then you'd have a bunch of zeroes.
You'd have n minus 1 zeroes plus 0 and you'd have an a2 and then you'd have a bunch of zeroes.
"And then you'd keep doing that, and then you would have a bunch of zeroes, and then you would have an an."
"Obviously, by our definition of vector addition, you add all these things up, you get this guy right here."
"And it's kind of obvious, because this right here is the same thing as our identity matrix times a1."
I just wanted to expose you to that idea.
"Now, let's apply what we already know about linear transformations to what we've just learned about this identity matrix."
I just told you that I can represent any vector like this.
Let me rewrite it in maybe terms of x.
"I can write any vector x as a linear combination of the standard basis, which are really just the columns of the identity matrix."
"I can write that as x1 times e1 plus x2 times e2, all the way to xn times en."
"And remember, each of these column vectors right here,"
"like for e1, is just 1 in the first entry and then all the rest are zeroes. e2 is a 1 in the second entry and everything else is 0. e5 is a 1 in the fifth entry and everything else is 0."
"And this I just showed you, and this is a bit obvious from this right here."
"Now, we know that by definition, a linear transformation of x-- let me put it this way."
"A linear transformation of x, of our vector x, is the same thing as taking the linear transformation of this whole thing-- let me do it in another color-- is equal to the linear transformation of-- actually, instead of using L,"
let me use T.
I used L by accident because I was thinking linear.
"But if I were take the linear transformation of x, because that's the notation we're used to, that's the same thing as taking a linear transformation of this thing."
They're equivalent.
"So x1 times e1 plus x2 times e2, all the way to plus xn times en."
It's equivalent statements.
"Now, from the definition of linear transformations, we know that this is the same thing, that the transformation of the sum is equal to the sum of the transformation."
So this is equal to the transformation of x1 e1 plus the transformation of x2 e2 where this is just any linear transformation.
Let me make that very clear.
This is any linear transformation.
"By definition, linear transformations have to satisfy these properties."
"So the transformation times x2 e2, all the way to this transformation times this last entry, the scalar xn times my standard basis vector en."
"And also ma, want to make sure you didn't overshoot it."
"Because if you overshot it, maybe you've got the firewall or the, I said widget."
"The firewall widget tightened down too much or, or, or something."
"You know, and there may be something you can do that would reduce that the, the, the degree by which you've overshot the, the baseline."
"Also, if the risk can't be contained within the acceptable level because you've got constraints, either in terms of budget or in terms of the attributes of the business."
"In other words, you know, we can't operate if we, if we have to put this control in place."
"Then, management may decide to accept the risk even though it's high."
"And the, those risks are also to be included in residual risk as you maintain this, these results of this risk assessment report."
"But those are the ones that probably are going to get the lion's share of your attention going forward. cuz those are the big, hairy ones for which you have not implemented any prevented, detected the work, recovery controls."
"Management is aware of them, because they've made this explicit decision to retain the."
"But you, all of you, are responsible for making sure nothing bad happens."
"I mentioned earlier I was going to give you an example of risk assessment report, and again this is a very simple one."
But it kind of puts all of the pieces together.
"The, the asset, in this case, was a customer list."
"And so, we looked at it in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability."
"And remember, I mentioned you could have this three point scale where three is high, two is medium, one is low."
"And, you know, I just threw some numbers in here so I've rated this high on confidentiality, medium on integrity, medium on availability."
"You look at the level of threats and it, again, it's a very generic term."
"But, you know, you obviously would look at specific threats but this is kind of a catch all."
"You know, I rated it two for confidentiality, two for integrity, and three for availability."
Level of vulnerabilities.
"Three for confidentiality, two for integrity, two for availability."
"And I just did a very, very simple methodology here where I just said, you know, what I'm calling the risk point is just the value of the asset times the threat times the vulnerability, A * B * C. It's just a way to rank it."
"So, three"
* two * three is eighteen.
Two * two * two is eight.
Two * three * two is twelve.
Which one are you going to focus the most attention on?
The eighteen.
"And then, you think about, well. what kind of treatment method can we apply to this? in this particular case , where you're"
"looking at confidentiality, the suggestion was that you reduce the risk by making the server password more difficult to guess."
"And by doing that, you reduce the level of threat to two and the level of vulnerability to two, so you've gone from eighteen to twelve."
"Self efficacy, caught in the motivation, and tolerance or ambiguity."
"By self efficacy, what we mean is that this is your belief that you can do something and something specific."
"So it's not self confidence, which is a bit more of a broader perception."
But it's efficacy in that you believe for a given scenario and a given situation that you can have success with that.
That you will be effective in that situation for that particular task or activity.
And that's a key predictor of individual performance.
The second element that we'll look at is the cognitive motivation.
"And again, that's that element of thinking."
Do you like to research?
"Do you like to understand? do you like to get a good clean sense of what's involved and what's at stake, and what you can do in that scenario?"
"And we see that if you do not have that high level of cognitive motivation, you tend to perhaps over rely on assumptions or experience."
And we see that successful entrepreneurs often have a higher need for cognitive motivation and that they're willing to do the research and they're willing to try and understand why things happen or may happen as they will.
And the third element is the tolerance re-ambiguity.
And that fundamentally is just being comfortable with change.
It's recognizing that you can't predict everything that things are going to happen that are unexpected.
And that you're comfortable within that.
And you believe that you can be successful within that changing environment.
"There are three cognitive biases to think about and to be aware of, and some of these are positives, and some of these can be negatives."
And the first if over confidence.
We certainly want to be confident.
We certainly want to believe in our venture.
But it's perhaps too much of a good thing if you are over confident.
"So, in that way, we want to be careful not to be overly ambitious."
And we've talked before about throwing good money after that.
It is okay to close a venture.
"It is okay to start something and stop it. and in that way again, there's something to be learned from that."
"But, you certainly want to be sure you know, that you balance your ideas."
That your thoughts are supported by research and that your assumptions are validated.
Representatives.
What we mean here is that you want to be sure that you are not basing your decisions on too small of a sample set.
"That you don't ask someone if they like your idea, they say yes, and you start your venture."
Ask many people.
Norms are defined as rules or standards that effect what's appropriate or inappropriate behavior in a group.
"Now, if any of you are teachers or have been teachers, you know, that you have to have order in your classroom and rules for students - what's appropriate and what's inappropriate."
"And even a parent does this in the family, which is actually a type of group."
It's more of a social group.
Kids have to know what is expected of them and when they're behaving appropriately and inappropriately.
"Well, norms keep things orderly."
They maintain respect.
"They make sure everybody has a chance to talk, makes sure that we don't take short cuts or discriminate against some one in some way or put somebody down."
"So, let's talk about norms."
"We're going to talk about two types of norms that are important, like the rules of the game or the ideal team."
"And now, these two types of norms, and this is actually something I am going to do is create my own categories for you just to make norms a little more analytic or make it a little more common sense."
I'm going to talk about process norms and relationship norms.
"First, let's talk about process norms."
"Now, process norms are rules about who can talk and what can they say when they're talking."
It's like turn-taking.
"Like what order are we going to take, and how are we going to make sure everybody gets to have some input?"
And let's not interrupt each other.
"Let's give everybody enough time, and let's listen and make sure that everybody gets a chance to say what should be said, and what shouldn't we say."
What's off limits?
What crosses the line into being something that's outside what this group really needs to be doing?
"Maybe it's confidential information, or maybe it's information about the past that's not relevant to what we're doing right now, staying on task for example."
That this is not on task.
This is a new issue; let's wait until later on that.
"It's a process norm, right there."
Now let's look at relationship norms.
"Now, relationship norms are about people."
Rules about treating each other in ways that are appropriate in a group.
It's about mostly respect.
"Listening and respecting each other and making sure we don't insult each other or condescend, even feel inferior in a group just to be on a mutual respect level that everybody is equally apart of the group and no one's better than anyone else."
Everybody is entitled to their opinions and no one's opinion is superior.
"That's one of the norms is a relational norm, and there are also norms about power."
What's appropriate use of power?
"Farewell, Egypt"
"So, after you've done all these things with respect to assessment and treatment, there's going to be some residual risk."
"You can't treat risk out of the, out of the system completely."
"So then, you have to make some decisions with respect to which ones you're going to accept and which ones you're going to try to, to transfer. the, the decision is driven by a number of different things."
"The first is the, the three realities that make risk acceptance, the risk acceptance decision a foregone conclusion."
Every organization has to make it.
"Which are, you're not going to be able to deal with all the risks in the organization."
Second one is no system can be made absolutely secure.
"And third is that, you've got a limited pool of resources for addressing these exposures."
"So, given those three things, those three realities, there's going to have to be a decision at some point about which risks you're willing to accept."
"And the way that you do that is the organization, the organization being the organization's management. needs to decide, needs to decide what its tolerance level is."
How much risk it's willing to accept.
"And then, if the risk that's been identified through the risk assessment process is beyond that level, then you look at maybe implementing some supplemental controls."
"And, if it's been the level, then you accept it. continue to monitor it, make sure it doesn't get out of out of tolerance. but that's basically the approach."
"Now, and I, I, I know I say this a lot, but I'm going to say it one more time."
"When you think about how management defines it's, it's acceptable"
"level of risk, it's not just direct dollar cost."
"It's, you know, how sensitive are they to bad publicity?"
How sensitive are they to being embarrassed?
"I would argue that most senior executives would rather have bad news come out about the company that doesn't directly affect them than they would be to have information comes out that makes them look stupid, makes them embarrassed."
"So, that embarrassment factor is going to, and should come into play ."
"Because you don't want to run into a situation where, you know, management says, okay."
"We, we're willing to assume an aggregate exposure of twenty million dollars a year."
And we don't want anything about us no negative publicity on the front page of the local newspaper.
"And you say, okay, chief, you got it."
"And then, something happens."
"And it's, you know, section two of the paper, page three."
"But it's, you know, the CFO, you know, left his laptop in his car."
"It was stolen, and it had the company's financial records on it."
It was within the tolerance.
"But he's, he's embarrassed."
"And I guarantee you that if you go back to him, and say, well, you know, it was within the tolerance that you specified."
"So, another use of single assignment form is that if we see the assignment w equals x in a block."
"So here, the register w is being just copied from the register x."
Then all subsequent uses of w can be replaced by uses of x.
"So, for example, Here we have an assignment to b And then we have a copy, a, is=to b."
"And then, down here, w e have a use of a in the last instruction."
"Well, that use of a in the last instruction can be replaced by a use of B. And this is called copy propagation, okay?"
Propagating copies through the code
"And by itself, notice, that this makes absolute no improvement in the code it's only useful in conjunction with some of the other optimizations."
"So, for example, in this case after we do the copy propagation, it might be the case that this instruction can be deleted."
"If A is not used any place else in the code, then this instruction can be removed."
Now let's do a little more complex example and use some of the optimizations that we've discussed so far On a slightly bigger piece of code.
So we are starting with this piece of code here on the left and we are going to wind up with this piece of code here on the right.
And how does that work?
"Well, first we have a copy propagation, so we have A is assigned the value five."
"And, so we can propagate that value forward."
And replace the use of a
"later on by five, and I should say."
"That when the value is propagated is a constant rather than a registered name is called Constant propagation instead of Copy propagation, but it's exactly the same thing."
"We, we, we have a single value assigned on the right hand side, either a register name or constant and we are replacing uses of that in later instructions by that register name or constant."
Okay?
"So once we have replaced a here by five now we can do constant folding, and now we have two constant arguments for this instruction."
So this two times five can be replaced by the constant ten.
Now notice we have another assignment of a constant to a register and so we can propagate that constant forward.
We can replace the subsequent uses of X by the number ten.
And now we have more opportunities for constant folding ten plus six can be replaced by the value sixteen.
"Alright now we have another, another value here which is a, a constant assignment so another instruction here which is just an assignment of a constant to a register so we can p ropagate that constant forward."
Alright then we wind up down here with ten times sixteen And I see over here in my final example here I didn't bother to propagate the ten to x.
"But we can do that, and this So we can either do this optimization."
"So x times sixteen if we didn't do the propagation, would be equivalent to x left shift four."
Or we can just replace this by ten times sixteen.
That'd be even better.
We wind up achieving the value 160.
So there's a little bit more memory.
The thing the Array is doing is it tends to be allocating extra slots that aren't being used.
So it's not usually tightly allocated either.
So in any given situation it could be as much as twice as big because it had that extra space.
So kind of in the tradeoff they tend to be in the same general range.
"This one has about twice the space, I think it's about four bites it has a four-byte pointer."
The thing's much bigger and it turns out actually this four bite pointer might be a smaller percentage of the overhead and will be a larger amount of the capacity in the excess case.
So for a lot of things they're going to be about the same range.
"And then there's a few isolated situations where, yeah, if you have very big things being stored having a lot of excess capacity is likely to be a more expensive part of the vector strategy than the link list."
But the
link list does have this built in overhead for every element.
"And so it's not the case where you would say right off the bat, well, definitely an array over link list because that the allocation space."
"It's like, hey, you have to think about the whole picture."
That is going to be the whole next lectures.
"Well, you know, it's about tradeoffs."
It's not that one strategy's always going to be the clearly better one.
"If it is, then we don't need to think about anything else."
There are times when you know that one is just great and there's no reason to think about anything else.
And then there's other times when there are reasons to think about different ways to solve the same problem.
So let me propose a case study that has some meat.
"You may think along the way, but you're going to really have to pretend that this is going to be relevant at first because it's going to seem like you've been transferred back to 1970, which was a very bad year, long before you born."
I want you to think about the idea of a text setter.
"So Microsoft Word, or you know your email send window, or"
"BB edit, or X code."
"All these things, right, have some backing of what usually is called a buffer, a buffer, sort of a funny word, right, but a buffer of characters behind it."
Okay.
And that buffer is used as the kind of document storage for all the characters that you're editing and moving around.
As you kind of bop around and move around there's something often called the cursor where you type characters and characters get moved as you insert.
"You can select things, and delete them, and cut, copy, and paste, and all that sort of stuff."
So what does that data structure look like?
What is the kind of thing that wants to back a buffer?
What kinds of things are important in that context to be able to support and what operations needs to be optimized for that tool to field [inaudible]?
"It has sort of the, these harps and a mysterious sound, and now. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Another man I can never know, because I cannot talk with him, for I am a mute and cannot speak."
"I am cut off from other men, but in my own silence. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; So we have Finn's internal monologue. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Here, know things they can never know. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Which is an interesting thing, because here is a man who cannot speak."
"And yet, narrates."
So who is he narrating to?
"In a way, the only people that he can speak to is the audience."
And though he speaks in symbols and abstractions.
He is the only one who speaks the truth.
"So, at the beginning of the film, Lewton and Robson are setting up a disjunction between image and sound, between what people say and the truth."
Between what can be seen and what can be heard.
"Now a scene that really emphasizes this split, and plays with it, is the scene of surgery."
Now watch and think about how the split between image and sound make this a powerful moment.
It begins with the steady sound of breathing of the patient and the cold clinical sound of the radio.
"At the same time, because we're in the room with that characters, we're privy to the terrible truth that we have a man who's not a doctor that must begin cutting into this body."
"It's interesting, interesting stuff watch. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Under anesthetic. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Alter to Panama, patient is asleep breathing very heavily. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; If the patient is completely anesthetized you may proceed."
"Are you ready? &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Alter to Panama, we are ready. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Panama to all tear."
"Capt Stone will bring his right hand to the point which we have already established. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; It's cold clinical and full of tension, but then we must begin cutting, framing moves in and we don't actually see the knife, we must imagine."
"Then we see it, then we don't. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Inside to a depth of one. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Inside to a depth of one. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Now here comes a moment when other people in the room begin to notice what's really happening and we have the split between image and sound."
"We, and people in the room will know that"
Stone is not doing the surgery.
"But the doctors on the other end of the radio, think that he is because all they have is sound, and everybody's lying through sound here. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Quarter inch, continue with the incision vertically 4 inches. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; In a way of course we're relieved that he can't do it because then we don't have to see it."
"But it's the complicity of everyone else in the room at covering up Stone's inability that it's troubling. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; Make the incision. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; I'll turn to Panama, wait a minute we're not ready yet. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; And now the lie begins."
It's a game played between showing and hearing.
"We can see the truth. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; [inaudible] we are ready, please repeat. &amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;gt; The doctors on the other end can't."
But when the patient is off screen and the actual cutting happens we don't see it.
"We have to infer what is happening on screen, or off screen rather."
This reminds me of Lewton's old maxim that what the audience can imagine is far worse than what he can actually show.
Now here's a film that wants us to listen to it very carefully.
It's also a film that's uses the typical strategies of Hollywood film fairly effectively.
"And I've got an example, since it's our first film that uses an underscore, and example of how underscoring works."
"[music] and it's quite good, so note how the soundtrack plays up the emotions that aren't expressed on the surface."
"This is a love scene, Ellen is hopefully and, and full of romance."
"Hopeful that it will finally happen between her and Stone, but he knows that he cannot commit."
"This is a space of the scan line in which I search, often called disparity, and for one location this is actually being minimized right over here."
Here's the basic algorithm for SSD minimization.
"We take two patches--one from the left image, one from the right image."
"We normalize, so the average brightness is zero."
We then take the normalized image and take the difference.
Then we square the difference.
That gives us a sum-of-square image.
Then we can sum up all the pixels to get a single value.
"This is our SSD value, our sum-of-square difference value."
All of these operations are easily implemented using the material you already know.
"The smaller the SSD value, the closer these two images correspond."
"This is a very common technique for comparing what's called image templates, where your left image is a template, and you're searching the left image for the optimal template."
"As you vary the location of the right image, you can find different SSDs."
You tend to get graphs for the right image.
"With an image template, it gives you certain errors."
Sometimes you get a very small disparate error.
"That's the place you'll pick for the best, mostly likely alignment."
"Hello and welcome to Freshly Served, healthy vegan recipes in Europe."
Tonight Phil and
"I are in a small town on the very South coast of Turkey called Kas and we are cooking in the kitchen on the, on the roof top of our hostel looking out into the surrounding hills around Kas, very very beautiful spot."
"Tonight, I am going to make a dish out of rolled oats because they were the only whole grain I could find in the grocery store and I am actually been meaning to make a dinner with oats for a while so we'll see how that comes out."
And what I've got so far is some vegetables that I've chopped up.
"I got onion, zucchini and mushroom."
"I'm gonna cooked those and then throw in the oats and get everything cook together and then I'm gonna throw in a raw avocado which is a little different from what I'm used to seeing because it has more of a smooth skin but it feels really soft, looks beautiful."
(Video Clip Playing)
"So, I've got this pan heated up and then I got all the stuff in the hostel come in to the company so far, they have a lovely bottle of Turkish olive oil right here so"
I'll pour this a little bit into the pan and then I'm gonna grab my mushroom first.
"Mushroom are the only vegetable that go in before the onions and that is because they take longer to cook and they like to soak up the oil, when you first throw them in you might feel like you need more oil but you don't."
"Just give it a stir, leave them on the heat and they will start to release their own juices, you don't need any more oil than that."
"Now, mushrooms do takes a little more time to cook so leave them enough time on the heat."
"While they are cooking I want to remind you to go read the recipe down below, HealthyVeganRecipes.net and you can also sign up for the hidden section of our website to check out all the stuff that we've been doing on our travels, be sure to go and sign up for that at HealthyVeganRecipes.net/Europe."
Everything is free there but you do have to go to that section of our website.
"So as I said, power is proportional to C times V squared times f, or it's capacitance times voltage times frequency."
"Capacitance, I said capacitor, it's a circuit element and basically it's detrimental to how computers work and it creates the heat."
"But the voltage is like your power socket, so you can change the voltage to make your computer more power efficient."
"And the frequency is, again, the clockspeed and how fast your computer is working."
So if we have this first machine on the
"left, and lets say its voltage is one, frequency is one, area is one, power is one, then its performance becomes one."
And that's the baseline.
"Now if we want two cores, and we want to keep the power the same, we have twice as much area but we can decrease the frequency and the voltage just a bit and get almost two times the performance increased."
"So Amdahl's law says that no matter how fast we can, how many computers we have we cant speed up the serialized portion."
And there's some math that we need to do about this.
"So if we assume that the time it takes from one machine is one, then s would be the fraction."
"So if s is the serial fraction, that means the fraction of the program that is serial, and T is the number of cores that we have."
Number of cores or processors.
"So the speedup, how much faster we can do it with that many cores, is the time it takes with one core divided by the time with all the cores."
"So if we assume it takes one time, then the time it takes with multiple cores is the time for the, wait where's the"
[INAUDlBLE] is the time it takes for the serial portion plus the time for the parallel portion divided by the number of cores which parallelize it.
That make sense?
"Now as we get more and more cores this one minus seth over P gets eh, smaller and smaller and smaller as P becomes in infinity we can just forget it."
"So the speed up is one over S. So if about a fifth of your program is serialized, sorry is serial not serialized, that's different."
If a fifth of your program is serial then you can get a speed up of five times.
"If all you program is serial one, then your speed up would be one."
You can't make it any faster.
If point one of your program is serial then you can get a ten times speed up.
That make sense?
Threads.
"Threads of execution, a thread is a thread of execution and this is a single stream of instructions."
"So [INAUDlBLE] when you have a connection of blocks, that can be thought of as a thread."
"The idea is that every program eh, has a starting thread, usually often times it's called main, and this thread can split and fork back so that multiple threads can be running at the same time."
And we could do this on one machine before we had multiple cores.
How did we do this?
We had many things running at the same time?
But the computer can only do one thing at a time.
"So if we go over to our expression, say well, just as before, we'll make it pi b now, instead of a, still is I zero, over four pi sigma."
One over R minus one over R prime.
"And you look at that and you say, hm, this is just the same as we had in part a, so therefore the answer is just the same as in part a."
Is that right?
"Well, actually, no, because r is the distance now from point b, from point B to the source, so R is here."
And that's just a little bit longer than it was in part a.
"In R prime, the distance to the distance to the sink is just a little bit shorter than it was in part a."
"So even though the equation is the same, the two distances are, are a little bit different."
"Some people would say, well in order to distinguish these symbolically, you might want to put a subscript on the r's."
"So I'll do that here, indicating that these r's come , come from field point B, rather than field point A."
"So, once again, I'll count on you to go ahead and substitute the numbers in."
I think you'll find it worthwhile to do so.
"You have to do one over RB and one over RB prime, with high precision, so as to retain any significant procession, and the result, but the result should not be zero, and in fact because of the symmetry of the problem, we can see that if you do this, it should come out to be the negative of the result that was found in part A."
Check and see if that what's happens.
So here we are in the problem session part
"C, and this part of the question it asks, what is the voltage between point A and point B?"
"And we are in very good shape to answer that question, because we already know the potential of A and the potential of B."
So the voltage between two points is simply the difference in the potential of two points.
So we can see Vab is equal to phi A minus phi b.
"You have the values for phi a and phi b from the previous section, previous sections, so if you could go ahead and substitute those in and put the net result right here."
Please do that now.
So now I thought I would ask you a more difficult challenge question.
"If you look at the calculations we have done so far, you'd say, well now look."
"Five p involves, for either p of a or p of b, if it's a we could say, okay, it's five a."
"And if we want to, we can put superscripts on the R, so that we have RA, or prime A."
If we want to we can factor out I0 over four pi sigma as we did before.
"But when you get it all done what we're doing is we are computing two terms, and each term is very similar to the other."
They're just a little tiny bit different.
"That seems like a situation that needs improvement because when you compute two things that are very close in value and then you subtract, it's confusing, it's repetitive, and it's prone to error."
That is to say human error but also error in computer calculations.
"I mean most numerical error comes from doing subtractions of two quantities that are very similar, because then there's a big loss of numerical significance."
"So is there a way, mathematically to reduce the two terms to one?"
"So in the array format we prefer this, putting the top of the vector on the far end because then there is the only jostling of that."
But needing access to the top here in the front is actually going to be the better way to get the link
list strategy you work in.
Let me actually go through both the push and the pop to convince you why this is true.
"So if I have access in the 10, 20, 30 case I could actually keep a separate additional pointer, one to the front and one to the back."
So it could actually become maintaining at all times as pointing to the back.
"If I did that, right, then subsequent push up to a 40, it's pretty easy to tack on a 40."
So it turns out it would be that the adding it's the push operation that actually isn't really a problem on this
"Strategy A. We can still kind of easily, and over time, if we have that tail pointer just tack one on to the end."
"As for the pop operation, if I have to pop that 30,"
I need to adjust that tail pointer and move it back a cell.
And that's where we start to get into trouble.
If I have a pointer to the tail cell there is no mechanism in the singly linked list to back up.
"If I say it's time to pop 30, then I would actually need to delete the 30, get the value out, but then I need to update this tail pointer to point to 20, and 30 doesn't know where 20 is, 30's oblivious about these things."
"And so the only way to find 20 in singly linked list would be go back to the very beginning, walk your way down, and find the one that pointed to the cell you just took out of the list and that's going to be an operation we want to avoid."
"In the Strategy B case, right, adding a cell, this means putting a 40 in allocating a new cell and then attaching it, splicing it in, right between wiring in two pointers, and we can do these links in constant time, and then popping one is taking that front row cell off."
"Easy to get to, easy to update, and splice out so no traversal, no extra pointers needed."
"The idea that there are, you know, 100 or 1,000 elements following the one that's on top is irrelevant."
"It doesn't have any impact, whatsoever, on the running time to access the front, or stuff another front, or taking it on or off the front."
So it is Strategy B that gives us the best setup when it's in the back of the linked list.
So let me go ahead and do it.
I think it's kind of good to see.
"Oh, like, what is it like to just write code and make stuff work."
And so I'm kind of fond of this and you can tell me.
I make a cell C it has an L type value and it has a soft T next right there.
And then I have a pointer to the front linked list cell.
"So in addition, you know, it might that in order to make something like size operate efficiently,"
"I might also want to catch the number of cells that update, or added or renew."
I can also decide to just leave it out for now.
Maybe
"I'll actually even change this to be the easier function, right, which is empty form."
That way I don't even have to go down that road for now.
I have an answer for that.
"If what most people think can't be done, if somebody has done it, the it can be done."
Ours get no grain whatsoever at any time.
What that means is that you have to have a phenotype that's an easy finisher.
"And many of the grain based, the phenotypes that the industry is using to finish on grain, tall legged, great big 1500-pound cows are what we call ""hard keepers""."
It takes a lot of energy to keep that boiler stove.
"What we want is what we call ""state-of-the-art 1950s genetics""."
An animal that'll put on fat.
Same with the pigs.
We don't like these lean pigs out of Britain.
"All they do is sit around in the feeder, they won't go and forage, and dig, and eat."
"We want the 1950 style, that will put on some fat, the easy keeper, and cattle the same way."
"So genetics plays a part, secondly, we don't try to make them gain weight in the winter."
"Some farmers, if they're not just fat and roly-poly, they think they're abusing them."
"No, actually going through a period of slow gain helps them to detoxify, kind of like a fast."
Which they would normally have in the winter anyway.
This is the way the typically would be growing.
"Absolutely, think about the deer."
A big blizzard will actually loose some dear from starvation.
"But the strong ones survive, and they go on to"
"live another day, and they've gone through this purge, and it's actually very healthy for them."
So we don't try to keep them roly-poly fat in the winter time.
"And finally, hay making is an art."
A lot of hay that's made is made simply as a mass of material as opposed to an art.
"Like round bales, they're wrapped too tight, all the hay goes one way, so they mold, there are all sorts of aflatoxins and molds in there."
"The old way to make hay was to put it in a stack with all this air, you know, like under a pole where air could get through it, and salt it down."
"We make hay in squares, both small squares and large square bales, where the stems are going all sorts of different ways, and when we stack it in the shed, we salt it down as a curative agent, to draw the moisture out and keep the degeneration from occurring, so we use a couple hundred dollars worth of salt every season, as a curative agent."
"That increases the palatability of the hay, it increases the curative aspects of it, so it's actually more nutritious and better, so that it actually gives them more nutrition when they eat it."
"So all these factors, genetics, and hay as art, and the controlled grazing, all of those things factor in to making a hay-less or short-hay system."
"One of the things we're learning for humans, and many people have known this for a long time, is the value of fermented foods, and regularly incorporating them into our diet."
"So with animals is the same thing, they benefit from the introduction of the bacteria and the bacterial products."
I guess the equivalent would be silage.
The bank that's holding toxic asset A.
And this is what I thought of after kind of thinking about it for about five or ten minutes.
You could imagine what the banks will come up with when they have billions of dollars and careers on the line.
"So if you have a scenario where you have this toxic asset A, and you economically want to do what I describe, but you don't want to be an affiliate and you don't want to give the appearance of self-dealing, what you do is you sell credit defaults on A that become supercheap, so you have essentially $7 exposure of credit defaults."
Let me do it this way.
So what you do is you sell credit default swaps.
So let's say you sell $7 of exposure.
"So your liability right here, is a seven-dollar CDS exposure, and I'll go over the economics of how this works in a second."
And you actually get some of the income stream.
It wouldn't even be accounted this way.
"You normally just have to-- if you're insuring $7 worth of credit default swaps, your liability isn't $7."
"You do the probability of default and all that, so your"
"liability will probably be-- I don't know, $1.00, whatever it is, and you get some income stream for it."
"But the general notion is that you sell credit default swaps on this toxic asset, on A, for really cheap."
"And just so you know what a credit default swap is, I've made a couple of videos on it, it is essentially an insurance policy on a loan or on a company, and if that company or this loan defaults, you say that you are going to pay up essentially the insurance amount."
So what you do is you sell $7 of credit defaults swaps on A.
"And just so you know, most of these toxic assets that these banks hold, these are assets that they were the originators for, and so, they're very particular to the individual banks."
"So a bank can definitely say I'm selling a credit default swap on A, and they know that, in the end, when I kind of outline this whole thing, they'll be the main beneficiary of it."
"So if you sell $7 of credit defaults swaps on A, what would I do?"
"Well, I'm a hedge fund."
What I do is I buy those credit defaults for really cheap.
"And then I invest in the TALF, right?"
"So let's say I'm a hedge fund, and I have two things."
"I have a $7 investment in the TALF-- sorry, in this Geithner"
"Plan, and then I also have this credit default swap, this insurance contract."
"And just so you know, depending on the price, you pay a certain amount every year."
"But the key here is that this bank could sell it, if they wanted to, for almost free."
They could essentially give away these credit default swaps.
"So if that bank did it, then the hedge fund's assets would have the $7 investment in this Geithner program, and then it'll have $7 of credit default swap protection."
Now what happens to this hedge fund?
"In the world where asset A is worth a lot, they get all of the upside through their investment in the Geithner Plan."
That $7 investment gets levered to $100.
"If this is true, level-two parallel universes must exist."
Time goes on forever... and there's a continual process of birth of universes... through cosmic catastrophes.
In the level-three type... there is an even more fantastic way parallel universes can form.
Here's how it works.
"In both the level-one and level-two kinds... there are replica universes separated from us... in the here and now by time and space... but in the level-three parallel universe... these copies of us are right here, right now..."
living in the exact same space and time.
They are separated from us... because they're in a different dimension of this same space.
"And to bend our minds more, there are an infinite number of them."
"If true, this controversial ""many worlds"" concept... has monumental consequences."
Parallel universes don't exist.
- Right.
- They're nonsense.
"They're something out of a ""Twilight Zone"" episode... a bad ""Star Trek"" rerun."
But you forget one thing.
One small quantum difference could separate me... from an entirely different universe... where I have multiple copies of myself...
leading multiple different lives.
This is shocking.
This even affects morals.
"I mean, why should I obey the law... knowing that in some universe, if I commit a crime..."
I'm going to get away with it?
The outrageous idea comes from the strange world... of quantum mechanics... the science of the atom.
In the bizarre atomic world... we have electrons that literally disappear... reappear someplace else.
Electrons that could be multiple places at the same time.
This staggering quantum mechanical phenomenon... is enshrined in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
"As crazy as it sounds, not only does quantum physics... tell you that a little particle can be in two places at once... but the so-called Heisenberg uncertainty principle... tells you that sometime the particle... even must be in two places at once."
"With a laser light and a glass apple... it can be seen how light particles, or photons, do this."
This shows that photons... the little particles of light coming out of my laser... can end up in several places at once.
And since we are made of little particles... that means if they can be in several places at once... so can we.
"In other words, in the instant that you have a fleeting thought... your whole body makes a quantum leap... into another dimension and into a parallel universe."
And what it means is that if I am walking down the pavement... and just make a snap decision... as to whether I'm going to go left or right... if my decision depends... on what some little particle in my brain was doing... then I will actually end up doing both... and the life of mine- it effectively splits into two parallel realities.
In a level-three type parallel universe... even a cat has many more than nine lives.
"The trouble is, in some of these worlds... the cat could be dead."
"Well, the only place you can go from V is to T and then at T there's nowhere to go."
So we recursively call DFS of T. There's no edges to go through.
"We finish the for loop and so T is going to be assigned an F value equal to the current label, which is N and here N is the number of vertices which is four."
So F of T is going to get.
Sorry T is going to get the assignment the label four.
"So then now we're done with T we back track back to V. We decrement the current label as we finish up with T. We get to V, and now there's no more outgoing arcs to explore, so its for loop is finished."
"So we're done with it, with depth-first search."
"So it gets what's the new current label, which is now three."
And again having finished with V we decrement the current label which is now down to two.
So now we go back to the outer for loop.
"Maybe the next vertex we consider is the vertex T. But we've already been there so don't bother to DFS on T. Then maybe after that we tried it on S. So, maybe S is the third vertex that the for loop considers."
We haven't seen S yet so invoked DSF starting from vertex S.
From S there's two arcs to explore the one with V. V we've already seen nothing is gonna happen with arc SV.
"But on the other hand the arc SW will cause us to recursively call DFS on W. From W we try to look at the arc from W to T, but we've already been to T so we don't do anything, that finishes up with W so depth-first search then finishes up at the vertex W, W gets the assignment of the current label, so F of"
W equals two.
"We decrement current label, now its value is one, now we backtrack to S, we've already considered all of S's outgoing arcs so we're done with S, it gets the current label which is one."
"And this is indeed one of the two topological orderings of this graph that we exhibited, a couple slides ago."
So that's the full description of the algorithm and how it works on a concrete example.
"Let's just discuss what are its key properties, its running time and its correctness."
"So as far as the running time of this algorithm, the running time is linear; it's exactly what you'd want it to be."
And the reason the running time is
"linear is for the usual reasons that these graph search algorithms have run a linear time, you're explicitly keeping track of which nodes you've been to so that you don't visit them twice."
"So you only do a constant amount of work for each of the N nodes and each edge in a directed graph, you actually only look at each edge once when you visit the tail of that edge."
So you only do a constant amount of work per edge as well.
Of course the other key property is correctness.
That is we need to show that you all are guaranteed to get a topological ordering.
So what does that mean?
That means every edge.
Every arc travels forward in the ordering.
"So if UV is in edge, then F of U, the label assigned to U, in this algorithm is"
less than the label assigned to V. The proof of correctness splits into two cases depending on which of the vertices U or V is visited first by depth-first search.
"Because of our for loop, which iterates over all of the vertices of the graph"
"So before we can run this equation, we're going to have to convert mL of solution into liters of solution."
"Let's go step by step to show how we do these conversions, and then how we can do the molarity at the end."
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take this 42.5 grams of sodium chloride and turn it into mols of sodium chloride.
I'm going to need to start with a molar mass of sodium chloride.
"We'll look at sodium and chlorine on the periodic table to get their masses, and I'm going to do 22.99 for sodium."
"I only have one sodium, and I only have one chlorine here - so I'm just going to do 35.44 here."
"Add those together, and I'll get the molar mass, which I'm going to be using as a conversion factor."
So I'm going to write this as 58.44 grams over 1 mol.
That's one way to write it.
"Or, I can flip the conversion factor and I can write 1 mole divided by 58.44 grams."
"Now I have the two conversion factors that I'll use for taking 42.5 grams of sodium chloride, multiplying it by one of these - it's going to be this one because I have grams up here, grams down there."
So these cancel out.
42.5 divided by 58.44.
I'll put the answer down here.
And that is going to give me 0.727 mols of sodium chloride.
"Now I know how many mols of sodium chloride I have, so I'm halfway there."
"The next thing that I have to do is take the volume, which is 375 mL, and multiply that by a conversion factor, so I can change it from mL into liters."
"So there are 1000 mL in one liter, which means that we can write these two conversion factors."
"I want to use the conversion factor that's going to turn mL into liters, so since it's on the top here, I will use a version of this conversion factor that puts mL on the bottom here."
"So - I'll cancel this out, cancel this out - I'll be left with liters, and when I do that - 375 divided by 1000 - I'm left with 0.375 liters."
Now I know my liters.
"Now I have my mols of sodium chloride and my liters of solution, and I can finish this by saying - molarity equals 0.727 mols divided by 0.375 liters, and I'm going to get 1.94 - that's rounded to 1-2-3 significant figures, for my molarity."
"1.94 are the units, and as before don't forget what this really means."
"It means for every liter of this solution there are 1.94 mols, 1.94 mols per 1 liter of solution."
"So sometimes you won't always be given mols, you won't always be given liters, and you'll probably have to convert from grams to mols, or from mL into liters."
So just make sure you've got your conversion factors set up straight.
"Now, in the next video, instead of having mols and liters and calculating molarity, you'll be given molarity and you'll have to use that as a conversion factor to move between mols in a solution and liters of a solution."
So I'm going to draw up the length-tension relationship.
This will be the key idea we're going to talk about in this video.
And it's very related to some stuff we've already talked about.
"So we've talked about, for example, the Frank-Starling curve."
The path in those just ended up being the regular derivative of each of the terms.
"And we're going to see, it's going to be the same thing here with the partial derivative."
So let's define the partial derivative of r with respect to s.
"And everything I do with respect to s, you can just swap it with t, and you're going to get the same exact result."
I'm going to define it as being equal to the limit as delta s approaches 0 of r of s plus delta s.
Only finding the limit with respect to a change in s comma t.
"We're holding t, as you can imagine, constant for given t, minus r of s and t."
All of that over delta s.
"Now, if you do a little bit of algebra here, you literally, you know-- r of s plus delta s comma t, that's the same thing as x of s plus delta s t i, plus y of s plus delta s t j, plus z."
All that minus this thing.
"If you do a little bit of algebra with that, and if you don't believe me, try it out."
"This is going to be equal to the limit of delta s approaching 0-- and I'm going to write it small because it'd take up a lot of space-- of x of s plus delta s comma t minus x of s and t, I think you know where I'm going."
"This is all a little bit monotonous to write it all out, but never hurts."
"Times s or divided by delta s times i-- and then I'll do it in different colors, so it's less monotonous-- plus y."
"Where every-- those limited delta s [? approaches ?] 0 applies to every term I'm writing out here. y of s plus delta s comma t minus y of s comma t, all of that over delta s times j."
"And then finally, plus z of s plus delta s comma t minus z of s and t, all of that over delta s times the z unit vector, k."
And this all comes out of this definition.
"If you literally just put s plus delta s in place for s-- you evaluate all this, do a little algebra-- you're going to get the exact same thing."
"And this, hopefully, pops out at you as, gee, we're just taking the partial derivative of each of these functions with respect to s."
"And these functions right here, this x of s and t, this is a non-vector valued function."
"This y, this is also a non-vector valued function. z is also a non-vector valued function."
"When you put them all together, it becomes a vector valued function, because we're multiplying the first one times a vector."
The second one times another vector.
The third one times another vector.
"But independently, these functions are non-vector valued."
So this is just the definition of the regular partial derivatives.
Where we're taking the limit as delta s approaches 0 in each of these cases.
So this is the exact same thing.
This is equal to-- this is the exact same thing as the partial derivative of x with respect to s times i plus the partial derivative y with respect to s times j plus the partial derivative of z with respect to s times k.
"I'm going to do one more thing here and this is pseudo mathy, but it's going to come out-- the whole reason I'm even doing this video, is it's going to give us some good tools in our tool kit for the videos that I'm about to do on surface integrals."
"So I'm going to do one thing here that's a little pseudo mathy, and that's really because differentials are these things that are very hard to define rigorously, but I think it'll give you the intuition of what's going on."
"So this thing right here, I'm going to say this is also equal to-- and you're not going to see this in any math textbook, and hard core mathematicians are going to kind of cringe when they see me do this."
Here's our first example of a martingale.
We can construct one from a random walk.
"Let Sn be equal to the sum of the Xi's from i equals 1 to N, where the Xi's are IlD with mean mu, then we can set Mn equal to Sn minus n times mu, and in that case, Mn is a martingale."
"We can see this because of the following, the expected value of Mn plus n, conditional time n information, is equal to, what we have over here on the right-hand side."
"So recall, Mn plus n will be equal to Sn plus m, minus n, plus m times mu."
"So this here is Sn, and here's our m plus m times is mu."
"Well were taking this expectation conditional on time n information, so in that case, what we can do is, we can take out the first nxi's, because they're known to us as a time end, so we can take them outside the expectation."
"And what we're left is the expectation of time n, of the sum of the xi's from i equals n plus 1 up to n plus m."
"Well, the xi's are IlD, so knowing the value of the first nxi's tells us nothing about these."
"We also know that they've got mean mu, so therefore the expected value of this sum here, is equal to m times mu."
We also have the n plus m mu over here.
"Now when we simplify all of this, this m-mu will cancel with this m-mu, we're left with the sum of the xi's and i equals 1 minus n times mu, and of course, we see that this is equal to Mn."
"So in fact, we have shown that the expected value of m, subscript m plus n, conditional on time n information is equal to Mn, and so it's a Martingale."
"In this example, we're going to consider what we will call a Martingale betting strategy."
"Let x1 x2 and so on be IlD random variables, where xi can take on two possible values, it can take on 1 or minus 1, in each case it takes on that value with probability 1/2."
"So you can imagine xi representing the result of a coin-flipping game, you win $1 if coin comes up heads, and you lose $1 if coin comes up tails, that assumes that you bet, $1 on the game."
"What we're going to do now is to consider a doubling strategy, where we keep doubling the bet until we eventually win, once we win, we stop and our initial bet is $1."
"So the first thing to note, is that the size of the bet on the nth play is 2 to the n minus 1, and that's because of the following, so on the first play, we bet $1 which is equal to 2 to the 0."
"On the second play we bet $2, because we're doubling our bet, and this is equal to 2 to the power of 1."
"On the third play of the game we would double our bet again, so we would bet 4, and that's equal to 2 squared, and so on."
"So we can see that every time you played the game, we've doubled our bet and so the play, the size of the bet on the nth play is 2 to the n minus 1."
"That of course assumes we're still playing at time n, because we will only be playing at time n if we haven't yet won the game up until this point."
"Let Wn denote the total winnings after m coin tosses, And assume we start off with W0 equals 0."
"What we're going to show, then, is that Wn is a Martingale."
"To see this, first note that Wn can only take on two possible values, it can only take on the value 1, or it will take on the value minus 2 to the n plus 1, and that is true for all n."
Why is this the case?
"Well, consider the following two situations."
"The first situation is as follows, suppose we win for the first time on the nth bet."
"Well in that case, Wn is equal to minus this sum here."
Where does this sum come from?
"Well, we've lost $1 on the first bet, $2 on the second bet, and so on, up to 2 to the n minus $2, on the n minus first bet."
Then on the nth bet we win and we win 2 to the power of n minus 1.
"So, I'm not sure if you can see it in the screen but these mushrooms are starting to release their juice here."
"Getting nice and soft, that was all the oil you needed there."
"So you can see now that the mushrooms have reabsorbed all of the liquid that they put out, that's when you know they're done and it's time to add the next thing which"
"I'm gonna put the onions in and another reason you put the onions in second of the mushroom is because of that juice so if the onions been in first, the mushrooms would be kind of infused with all the onion flavour."
This way they stay separate but as you combine them in the dish their flavours merge together just not as much as if the mushrooms were totally in first.
So I let the onions soften up a little bit before adding the zucchini and letting them soften a little bit as well.
What I'm gonna do next is put a little sprinkle of salt on there.
I'll give it a good stir around and then put the lid on this dish so that the juices can come out from the vegetables while they cook.
"The salt helps that cooking process so as soon as you get that salt on there, give it a little stir around and then get that lid on pretty quickly."
Alright!
So giving it a few minutes to cook in here and as you take the lid off you can see a lot of steam coming up.
There's gonna be lot of moisture in here which is perfect because the next thing were gonna add is the seasoning.
And what I'm gonna use is some of my garlic and onion powder.
You can find these mixes on the hidden section of the website at HealthyVeganRecipes.net/Europe.
"So, I've got some garlic and onions, I've really want to make sure that this dish came out savoury because it is oats and it's usually a breakfast dish."
"So I've got a whole onion in there as well as the onion and garlic powder and then I'm just gonna use some of my Italian herb mix, also in that hidden section of the website."
"Give it a squeeze as you put it in there and I'm gonna put on what's goona looks like a lot, the reason is it's going for the vegetables as well as the oats."
"Like I said, we really want to make sure that this taste like dinner and not breakfast."
So give that a stir around.
And then make sure that those seasonings coat the vegetables first and then you're gonna put the grains in which I've got about two cups of oats here.
They are rolled oats?
"Yes, sorry."
Rolled oats!
And you want to season those oats as well so I'm gonna give them a two minutes in the heat with no moisture just the vegetables.
Make sure those flavours really coat around the rolled oats.
"So, the oats are looking a little bit toasted, they've got seasonings on them so I'm gonna do now is add the liquid and I'm using water but if you have vegetable broth that would be perfect."
I'm gonna be kind of careful with it because I'm not sure how much to add before the oats gets to be really mushy but I've got about two cups of water here ready to go.
And if you have an oven this would be lovely if you put the water in and then pop it in the oven to bake it since I don't what I'm gonna do and looks like I'm gonna do about cup and a half of water and so like I don't have an oven what I'm going to do instead just put this lid back on here and allow those oats to really cook in there.
So my avocado was a little bit different and what I'm gonna have to do is scoop it out with a spoon rather than my usual flip it inside out because the skin is very flimsy.
Doesn't like to flip!
And over here are oats that have a few minutes to cook.
"I can see they're looking very soft, they're trying to stick to the bottom of the pan a little bit so I turned the heat off for the last few minutes and now I think it's time to give it a try and see how this works out."
It get the right answer for all of the training cases if any such vector exists.
And our proof is gonna assume that there is a vector that gets the right answer for all training cases.
"We'll call that a feasible vector, and an example of a feasible vector is shown by the green dot in the diagram."
"So we start with a weight vector that's getting some of the training cases wrong, and in the diagram, we've shown a training case that it's getting wrong."
"And what we want to show, this is the idea for the proof, is that every time it gets a training case wrong, it will update the current weight factor."
In a way that makes it closer to every feasible weight vector.
So we can represent the square distance of the current weight factor from feasible
"light factor, as the sum of a square distance along the line of the input factor that defines the training case, and around the square distance orthogonal to that line."
The orthogonal square distance wouldn't change and the square distance along the line of the input factor will get smaller.
"So our hopeful claim is that every time the perceptron makes a mistake, our current weight vector is gonna get closer to all feasible weight vectors."
"Now this is almost right, but there's an unfortunate problem."
"If you look at the feasible weight factor in gold, it's just on the right side of the plane that defines one of the training cases."
"And the current weight factor is just on the wrong side, and the imperfectry's quite big."
"So when we add the input vector to the crown weight factor, we actually get further away from that gold feasible weight factor."
"So our hopeful claim doesn't work, but we can fix it up so that it does."
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna define a generously feasible weight vector.
"That's a weight vector that not only gets every training case right, but it gets right by at least a certain margin, with the margin is as big as the input vector for that training case."
"So we take the cone of feasible solutions and inside that we have another cone of general feasible solutions, which get everything right by at least the size of the input vector."
"And now, our proof will work."
"Now we can make the claim that every time the perceptron makes a mistake, the square distance to all the generously feasible weight vectors will be decreased by at least the squared length of the input vector, which is the update we make."
"So given that, we can get an informal sketch of a proof of convergence."
I'm not going to make this formal.
I'm more interested in the engineering than the mathematics.
"If you're a mathematician, I'm sure you can make it formal yourself."
You're different than they are.
"Therefore, they are jealous."
"I completely understand you, stay calm."
"If you need a little change, tonight I'll take you to Mardin."
We'll take a walk.
We'll stay as long as you want.
Little change?
I look at as you're my brother and you're acting like that?

"The city was founded by Henry Flagler as a community to house the servants working in the two grand hotels on the neighboring island of Palm Beach, across Lake Worth. The original spelling was ""Westpalmbeach"", but it was feared that the 13-letter word would be a bad omen for the new community. On November 5, 1894, 78 people met at the ""Calaboose"" (the first jail and police station located at Clematis St. and Poinsettia, now Dixie Hwy.) and passed the motion to incorporate the Town of West Palm Beach in what was then Dade County (now Miami-Dade County). This made West Palm Beach the oldest incorporated municipality in the county and in South Florida. The town council quickly addressed the building codes and the tents and shanties were replaced by brick, brick veneer, and stone buildings. The city grew rapidly in the 1920s as part of the Florida land boom. Many of the city's landmark structures and old neighborhoods were built during this period."

"Temporary abdominal closure techniques are used to postpone definite closure until predisposing factors causing pathologic elevation of intra abdominal pressure are resolved. These techniques include the Bogota bag, absorbable mesh, vacuum pack dressings, the Wittmann patch or velcro burr and the KCI VAC or Abthera dressings."
Temporary abdominal closure techniques are most commonly used in cases of abdominal compartment syndrome in which decompressive laparotomy is necessary to reduce intra abdominal pressure to restore system perfusion.
"The Bogota bag acts as a hermetic barrier that avoids evisceration and loss of fluids. Another advantage to the Bogota bag, is that the abdominal contents can be visually inspected."
"The bogota bag can be used in cases of 'burst abdomen' following laparotomies, especially those using a midline horizontal incision. Burst abdomen is usually characterized by a serosanguinous pink discharge from the wound, 6–8 days after surgery"

Nitro compound
A nitro compound is a molecule that has the nitro group. The nitro group is made of one nitrogen atom connected with two oxygen atoms (-NO2). The nitrogen is also bonded to the rest of the molecule.
"Nitrogen normally has only three bonds. In a nitro group, the bond is considered positively charged. Then one bond of the oxygen is negatively charged, and the other has a double bond. In reality, the best way to represent the nitro group is to consider it to have delocalized electrons. Then all three atoms are sp2 hybridised."
Reaction.
"Nitro compounds are very explosive. This is because, at high temperature, nitro compounds can decompose and release nitrogen gas. This reaction is very exothermic (gives out a lot of energy). Many explosives have nitro groups, for example trinitrotoluene (TNT)."

Cradle of Humankind
"The Cradle of Humankind is a World Heritage Site. It was first named by UNESCO in 1999. The site is about 50 kilometres northwest of Johannesburg, South Africa in the Gauteng province, and occupies ."
"The site's limestone caves, including the Sterkfontein Caves, were where fossils were found. A 2.3-million year-old fossil ""Australopithecus africanus"" (nicknamed 'Mrs. Ples') was found in 1947 by Robert Broom and John T. Robinson. The find followed the 1924 discovery of the juvenile ""Australopithecus africanus"" skull, 'Taung Child', by Raymond Dart, at Taung in the North West Province of South Africa, where excavations still continue."
"The name ""Cradle of Humankind"" reflects the fact that the site has produced a large number, as well as some of the oldest, hominid fossils ever found, some dating back as far as 3.5 million years ago. Sterkfontein alone has produced more than a third of early hominid fossils ever found."
Recent work.
"The remains of several partial skeletons of a previously unknown Australopithecan species were found in 2008 near Johannesburg. They have been dated to about two million year ago (mya). A recent re-examination of two partial skeletons of ""Australopithecus sediba"" has led to its identification as close to the origin of the genus ""Homo"". Not all palaeoanthropologists agree this is a new species."
"A new analysis shows this species had a human-like pelvis, hands and teeth, and a chimpanzee-like foot. In six separate research reports, palaeontologists reported on the anatomy of a juvenile male skeleton, MH1, a female skeleton, known as MH2, and an isolated adult tibia or shinbone, known as MH4. The findings suggest that some species of australopithecine climbed trees, some walked on the ground, and some did both."
"Colleagues in England investigated the teeth. Like other parts of the skeleton, the teeth are a mosaic of primitive and human-like features."

Variscan orogeny
The Variscan orogeny (Hercynian orogeny) is an ancient mountain-building event in the late Palaeozoic era. It was caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana to form the supercontinent of Pangaea.
"It explains many older features of the present-day world. The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains."
"This geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe."
Higher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny.

Père Goriot
"Le Père Goriot (, ""Old Goriot"" or ""Father Goriot"") is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850). It is in the ""Scènes de la vie privée"" section of his novel sequence ""La Comédie humaine"". It is set in Paris in 1819. It follows the lives of three characters: the elderly Goriot, a mysterious criminal named Vautrin and a naive law student named Eugène de Rastignac."
The novel takes place during the Bourbon Restoration. It brought major changes to French society. The struggle by individuals to reach a higher social status is a major theme in the book. Balzac analyzes through Goriot and others the nature of family and marriage that provides a pessimistic view of them.
Publication.
"In the first book edition, the novel had seven chapters:"
"The character Eugène de Rastignac had appeared as an old man in Balzac's earlier philosophical fantasy novel ""La Peau de chagrin"". While writing the first version of ""Le Père Goriot"", Balzac named the character ""Massiac"", but he decided to use the same character from ""La Peau de chagrin"". Other characters were changed in a similar way."
Legacy.
"""Le Père Goriot"" is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on French literature has been considerable, as shown by novelist Félicien Marceau's remark: ""We are all children of ""Le Père Goriot""."""
"In his book ""Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World"", Martin Kanes calls it ""the keystone of the ""Comédie humaine"". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's study ""Balzac's Recurring Characters"". Entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer."
"Thus, says Balzac biographer Graham Robb, ""Goriot"" is one of the novels of ""La Comédie humaine"" that can safely be read in English for what it is."""
"According to the editor of the Norton Critical Edition, Peter Brooks, the book is now seen as ""the most endurable and popular of Balzac's myriad works"" and a ""classic of the [18th]-century European novel""."
"A well-known line of this book by Balzac is when Vautrin tells Eugene, ""In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline."""
"This has been reworked by Mario Puzo in the novel ""The Godfather"" (1969) and its movie adaptation (1972) as ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse""."
It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes (2005) by the American Film Institute.

Hematopoiesis
"Hematopoiesis (or haematopoiesis; sometimes also haemopoiesis) is the formation of blood cells. In a healthy adult person, about 1011–1012 new blood cells are produced daily to keep steady state levels in the blood circulation."
"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or hemocytoblasts are the stem cells that give rise to all the other blood cells. The process is called hematopoiesis.&lt;ref name=""Birbrair n/a–n/a""&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They are in the core (bone marrow) of most bones."
As a stem cell matures it undergoes changes in gene expression which limit the cell types it can become. It moves closer to a specific cell type (cellular differentiation). These changes can often be tracked by monitoring the presence of proteins on the surface of the cell. Each successive change moves the cell closer to the final cell type and limits its potential to become a different cell type.
HSC studies through much of the past half century have led to a much deeper understanding. More recent advances have resulted in the use of HSC transplants in the treatment of cancers and other immune system disorders.

In the case of Black Forest ham, the salting, and curing needs to be done in the Black Forest. Most of the pigs used come from other regions of Germany, or the European Union. This only applies to the European Union, though. In the United States and Canada, there are different kinds of ham which are sold as ""Black Forest ham"": These are usually produced locally, and very often, the methods of producing them are different from the original of the Black Forest."

Preparation.
"Raw ham is salted and seasoned with garlic, coriander, pepper, juniper berries and other spices. After curing for two to three weeks, the salt is removed and the ham aged an additional two weeks. It is then cold-smoked using ""local conifers and sawdust"" at around for several days. It ripens in an air-conditioned room for several weeks, becoming almost black on the outside and acquiring much of its distinctive flavor. As a result it usually tastes very salty."
Characteristics.
"Black Forest ham is boneless and about one-fifth fat. It has a very pronounced flavor and is common in German cuisine. It may be eaten fresh, for example on ""Holzofenbrot"" or rye bread, with fruit, or used as an ingredient in cooked dishes. Whole pieces of Black Forest ham can be preserved for months when stored properly. It is typically served at room temperature."

Names.
"Most Polish counties are named after their capital city, or county seat."
"If a county seat has a double-barreled name, as with ""Maków Mazowiecki,"" the county may become either ""Maków County"" or ""Maków-Mazowiecki County."" Due, in all but the first case, to the existence, respectively, of two ""double-barreled"" county seats with the identical noun name, the corresponding adjectives """"bielski"","" """"grodziski"","" """"ostrowski"" and ""tomaszowski"""" each denote ""two"" distinct counties."
History and functioning.
"Some Polish urban communes constitute administrative entities called the ""urban county"" (""powiat grodzki""), similar in local administration and self-governance to ""land counties."" An average county (the largest being the powiat of Białystok) comprises 5 – 8 communes. The largest urban county, in terms of population and area, is the city of Warsaw."
"The history of Polish counties goes back to the second half of the 14th century. They remained the basic units of territorial organization in Poland, then in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, until the latter's total dismemberment by its neighbors in 1795."
"In the 19th century, the county continued to function in the part of Poland that had been incorporated into the Russian Empire (""Congress Poland""), and as the Polish equivalent of the German ""Kreis"" in the German-governed Grand Duchy of Poznań."
"After Poland regained independence in 1918, the county again became the basic territorial unit throughout Poland. ""Powiat""s (counties) were abolished in 1975 in favor of a larger number of voivodships, but were reintroduced in 1999. There are now 314 ""land counties"" (""powiat ziemski"") and 65 ""urban counties"" (""powiat grodzki""), more formally ""municipalities with county status"" (""miasto na prawach powiatu"")."

In the track became the first Grand Prix circuit to be awarded the distinguished (important) FIA Institute Centre of Excellence award. The award was given for having and keeping high race safety and medical facilities.
Construction and design.
"The track was designed by German architect Hermann Tilke. Tilke also designed the Sepang circuit in Malaysia. The track cost approximately US $150 million to build. It can be set-up as six different tracks, including a test oval and a drag strip."
The track had a special problem. The track was located in the middle of a desert. There were concerns that sand would blow onto the track and disrupt the race. Organizers (the people who run the race) were able to keep the sand off the track by spraying an adhesive (glue) on the sand around the track.
The surface of the track has a high level of grip. The same surface is used at the Yas Marina Circuit for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

1944 United States presidential election
"The 1944 United States presidential election happened on November 7, 1944. Incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the general election. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt won 432 votes while Dewey won 99. Roosevelt, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as president."
"The election was held during the latter part of World War II. By this time the war was going well for the United States and its Allies. Roosevelt had already served longer than any other president, but remained popular. Unlike in 1940, there was little doubt that he would run for another term as the Democratic candidate, as his health was failing. Dewey, the Governor of New York, campaigned against the New Deal and for a smaller government. But he could not convince the country to change course. Roosevelt's aides covered up the fact the president was in poor health. Roosevelt would die in office three months after starting his fourth term. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, would serve out the remainder of his term of office."
The campaign.
"The Republicans campaigned against the New Deal. They wanted a smaller government and less-regulated economy. Roosevelt's continuing popularity was the main theme of his campaign. To quiet rumors of his poor health, Roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign trip in October and rode in an open car through city streets. A high point of the campaign occurred when Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio where he ridiculed Republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money. He particularly ridiculed a Republican claim that he had sent a US Navy warship to pick up his Scottish Terrier Fala in Alaska. He added that ""Fala was furious"" at such rumors. The speech was met with loud laughter and applause. In response, Dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a few days later on national radio. He accused Roosevelt of being ""indispensable"" to corrupt big-city Democratic organizations and American Communists. Dewey also referred to members of Roosevelt's cabinet as a ""motley crew"". However, the allies had several battlefield successes in Europe and the Pacific during the campaign. These included the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the successful Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944. These were Roosevelt's greatest assets in his campaign."
Results.
The 1944 presidential election was a milestone in American politics for two reasons. It was the first time a candidate for president was born in the 20th century. It was the last time Democrats carried every state in the southern United States. The election had at least one other long-reaching effect. It led to the 1951 passing of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president of the United States.

The Flory convention.
"In modeling the position vectors of atoms in macromolecules it is often necessary to convert from Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) to generalized coordinates. The Flory convention for defining the variables involved is usually employed. For an example, a peptide bond can be described by the x,y,z positions of every atom in this bond or the Flory convention can be used. Here one must know the bond lengths formula_1, bond angles formula_2, and the dihedral angles formula_3. A three-dimensional structure can be described using the Flory convention by applying a vector conversion from the Cartesian coordinates to the generalized coordinates."

Early history (1502–1658).
"The island was discovered in 1502 by the Portuguese admiral João da Nova, and he named it ""Santa Helena"" after Helena of Constantinople. The traditional date of this discovery was long thought to be 21 May, but the results of an investigation into the discovery published in 2015 concluded this date is probably wrong, the 3 May seeming to be historically more valid. Another theory holds that the island found by De Nova was actually Tristan da Cunha, to the south, and that Saint Helena was discovered by some of the ships under the command of Estêvão da Gama on 30 July 1503."
"The Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. Though they formed no permanent settlement, the island was, for ships travelling from Asia to Europe, an important place to stop to get food and water, and frequently sick sailors were left on the island to recover. After 1588, the island was visited also by Dutch and English ships."
"The Dutch Republic formally made claim to St Helena in 1633, although there is no evidence that they ever occupied, colonised or fortified it. By 1651, the Dutch had mainly abandoned the island in favour of their colony at the Cape of Good Hope."
East India Company (1658–1815).
"In 1657, the English East India Company was given a permit to govern St Helena by Oliver Cromwell, and the following year the Company decided to colonise the island with farmers. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, got there in 1659, and made St Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort was completed and a number of houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a Royal permit to start a colony in the island. The fort was named ""James Fort"" and the town ""Jamestown"", in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II of England."
"The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792 and Chinese workers were brought to work in the farms. Many were allowed to stay, and their descendents became integrated into the population."
British rule (1815–1821) and Napoleon's exile.
"In 1815, the British government decided to use the island of St. Helena as a place of detention for Napoleon Bonaparte. To prevent any attempt to escape from the nearby islands, they formally annexed the islands of Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. In 1821, Napoleon died on the island of St Helena."
"In 1858, the French emperor Napoleon III got the possession, in the name of the French government, of Longwood House and the lands around it, last residence of Napoleon I (who died there in 1821). It is still French property."
Crown colony (1834–1981).

Results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries
"This article will show the current results of the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. The Democratic Party presidential primary is a process of choosing delegates, or people that represent someone, to go to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. People in each state will vote on who they think will be good for the presidency, and each candidate gets a certain amount of delegates based on the number of votes they receive."
The primaries began on 1 February 2016 in Iowa. The remaining candidates are former first lady and secretary of state and senator Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders.
"On June 6, 2016, the Associated Press reported that senator Hillary Clinton has gotten enough delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee. However, their count includes some superdelegates. Since superdelegates can vote however they want at the Democratic convention, their votes could change at any time before then, so it is possible (but only remotely possible) that Clinton will not get the nomination. Bernie Sanders endorsed Clinton on 12 July 2016."
Results.
All delegate total are approximate.
Armenian calendar
"The Armenian calendar was the main calendar used in Armenia during the medieval period. The year in this calendar is exactly 365 days long, divided into twelve months of thirty days each, plus five extra days that are called ""aveleacʿ"" in the Armenian language, which are not a part of any month. The first year in the Armenian calendar is equal to the year 552 AD in the Gregorian calendar. This calendar was mainly used in the medieval era, but is also used in modern times by some Armenian nationalists."
"This calendar has no leap days. For that reason, it shifts backwards against the Gregorian calendar over a period of 1,461 years."
Months.
The twelve months in the calendar have differen names to the months usually used in English.

Le Roy le veult
"""Le Roy le veult"" (""The King wills it"") or ""La Reyne le veult"" (""The Queen wills it"") is a Norman French line used in the Parliament of the United Kingdom to show that a public or private bill has received Royal Assent from the Monarch."
History.
"The practice of giving Royal Assent came from William the Conqueror to show that the King intended for something to be made law. Norman French came to be used as the normal language of the educated classes and of the law, though Latin continued to be used with it. The work of the Parliament of England was conducted entirely in French until the latter part of Edward III's reign (1327–1377) and English was only rarely used before the reign of Henry VI (1422–61, 1470–71). Royal Assent was sometimes given in English, though more often in French. The practice of recording Parliamentary statutes in French or Latin stopped by 1488 and statutes have been published in English ever since."
"During the period of the Protectorate, when the Lord Protector (Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard) governed the country, assent was given in English. The old practice of giving assent in Norman French was resumed following the Restoration in 1660 and has continued ever since. There has only been one attempt to remove it, when the House of Lords passed a bill in 1706 ""for abolishing the use of the French tongue in all proceedings in Parliament and courts of justice."" The bill failed to pass the House of Commons. Although the use of French in courts was later abolished in 1731, Parliament's practice was not affected."
Usage.
"The line is used to show that the Monarch has granted their Royal Assent to a bill in order to make it become law. It is used by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the House of Lords. It is only used after the Lord Chancellor with the Lords Commissioners, has read out the Letters patent for the bill. The Clerk of the Crown then reads out the short title of the bill and the Clerk of the Parliament responds by saying the line 19 times towards the House of Commons at the bar of the House. The line is also written on the paper of the bill to show that the Monarch granted Royal Assent to the bill."
"The line has been used wrongly on other bills, same as the wrong line has also been used for government bills. There are a few occasions where this has happened, most notably on the Act of Supremacy 1558 where """"Soit fait comme il est désiré"", the line used for personal bills, was used instead of ""La Reyne le veult""."
"If the Royal Assent is refused, the line ""Le Roy / La Reyne s'avisera"""" would be used, though in practice no British monarch since Queen Anne has not given royal assent since a dispute over militia in Scotland in 1707."
George Herriman

"It is made up of two bridges that were both built in the mid-19th century. The eastern side was built by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway in 1858-60 to carry trains into Victoria Station. This was the first railway bridge across the Thames in central London. The western side was built by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1865/66."
"Both bridges were rebuilt in steel in 1963–67, the original piers now being wrapped in concrete. The designer for this work was Freeman Fox &amp; Partners."
"On the north bank is Pimlico to the north and east and Chelsea to the west. The Lister Hospital and the Royal Chelsea Hospital are immediately to the north west. On the south bank is Nine Elms to the east and Battersea to the west. Battersea Power Station is immediately to the south of the bridge, and Battersea Park to the south west."

History.
Vauzhall Bridge in 1906. It replaced an earlier bridge as part of a program for redeveloping the south bank of the Thames. The original bridge was itself built on the site of a former ferry.
"The building of both bridges was difficult, with both the first and second bridges needing multiple redesigns from multiple architects. The original bridge, the first iron bridge over the Thames, was built by a private company and was run as a toll bridge before being taken into public ownership in 1879. The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane."
The present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.
"In June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames."

"A few of the crossings listed are public pedestrian crossings making use of walkways across lock gates and bridges above or near-by weirs. Most of the other locks on the River Thames also have walkways across their lock gates and weirs, but these either do not fully cross the river, or are for the use of authorised people only, and are so are not listed."
"Besides the ferry crossings listed, there are commuter boat services along the river in the city of London, and tourist boat services running both in London and upstream. Although the main purpose of these services is not to carry people across the river, it may be possible to use them to do so."

Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award
"In Major League Baseball, the Rookie of the Year Award is given each year to one player from each league as voted on by the Baseball Writers Association of America (BBWAA). The award was start in 1940 by the Chicago chapter of the BBWAA. They selected a winner every year from 1940 through 1946. The award became national in 1947; Jackie Robinson, the Brooklyn Dodgers' first baseman, won the first award. One award was presented for both leagues in 1947 and 1948; since 1949, the honor has been given to one player each in the National and American League. At first, the award was known as the J. Louis Comiskey Memorial Award, named after the Chicago White Sox owner of the 1930s. The award was renamed the Jackie Robinson Award in July 1987, 40 years after Jackie Robinson broke the baseball color line."
"Of the 128 players named Rookie of the Year, 14 have been selected for the National Baseball Hall of Fame—Jackie Robinson, five American League players, and eight others from the National League. The award has been shared twice: once by Butch Metzger and Pat Zachry of the National League in 1976; and once by John Castino and Alfredo Griffin of the American League in 1979. Members of the Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers have won the most awards of any team (with 16). This is twice the total of the New York Yankees (eight), who have won the most in the American League. Fred Lynn and Ichiro Suzuki are the only two players who have been named Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player in the same year. Fernando Valenzuela is the only player to have won Rookie of the Year and the Cy Young Award in the same year. Sam Jethroe is the oldest player to have won the award, at age 32, 33 days older than 2000 winner Kazuhiro Sasaki (also 32). Buster Posey of the San Francisco Giants and Neftali Feliz of the Texas Rangers are the 2010 winners."
Qualifications and voting.
"From 1947 through 1956, each BBWAA voter had their own rules for decide who was a rookie. In 1957, the BBWAA first defined the term as someone with fewer than 75 at bats or 45 innings pitched in any Major League season before the current season. This guideline was later changed to 90 at bats, 45 innings pitched, or 45 days on a Major League roster before September 1 of the last year. The current rule is 130 at bats, 50 innings pitched or 45 days on the active roster of a Major League club (except for time in military service or on the disabled list) before September 1 was first used in 1971. Since 1980, each voter names three rookies: a first-place choice is given five points, a second-place choice three points, and a third-place choice one point. The award goes to the player who receives the most total points. Edinson Volquez received three second-place votes in 2008 even though he was not a rookie under the award's definition."
"Some baseball writers have criticized the voting in recent years because several players who played in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) have won the award. These winners include Hideo Nomo in 1995, Kazuhiro Sasaki in 2000, and Ichiro Suzuki in 2001. The current definition of rookie for the award is based only on Major League playing. Some writers feel that past NPB players are not true rookies because of their past professional playing. This issue came up in 2003 when Hideki Matsui lost the AL award to Ángel Berroa in a close vote. Jim Souhan of the ""Minneapolis Star Tribune"" said he did not think Matsui was a rookie in 2003 because ""it would be an insult to the Japanese league to pretend that experience didn't count."" ""The Japan Times"" had a story in 2007 on calling Daisuke Matsuzaka, Kei Igawa, and Hideki Okajima as rookies, saying ""[t]hese guys aren't rookies."" Past winners such as Jackie Robinson, Don Newcombe, and Sam Jethroe had professional experience in the Negro Leagues."

Fight or flight response
"The fight-or-flight response (or acute stress response) is a set of physiological changes that occur when an animal is threatened. The changes include increased heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure."
This response was first described by W.B Cannon. He found that animals react to threats with a general discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. This leads to changes such as those mentioned above. The changes prepare the animal for fighting or fleeing. This response is the first stage of a general adaptation that regulates stress responses among vertebrates and other organisms.
Evolutionary perspective.
Winter larder.
"On the Moroccan island of Mogador, falcons seem to imprison small birds by trapping them in crevasses, presumably saving them to eat later."
"Mogador has the ruins of a fortress, a mosque and a prison. Today the island is a nature reserve, where Eleonora’s falcons nest among the ruins. They hunt migrating warblers, hoopoes and other birds."
"Researchers came across small birds trapped in deep cavities, their flight and tail feathers removed. The birds were unable to move their wings or use their dangling legs. Eleonora’s falcons have been seen building up larders of up to 20 dead birds during migration season, when prey is plentiful. But ""storing snacks that are still alive could be a unique behaviour"" said an expert."

Ainu people
"The Ainu people are the native population of northern Japan and the eastern part of Russia, mostly in the Amur river region, Sakhalin, the Kuril islands and on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The term is also used for their culture and language in the Ezo region (Hokkaido)."
History.
"The majority of their ancestors, the Jōmon people, arrived in Japan about 30,000 – 15,000 years ago from Central Asia and southern Siberia. They were largely replaced by the proto-Japanese which arrived from southeastern China about 2,000 years ago. The Ainu have strong similarities with Palaeolithic Europeans and people of the Middle East as well as with Native American groups of the northwestern coastal culture area in North America. Some scholars think they were related to the Emishi of northern Honshu."
"During and after the Yayoi period they were attacked by the early Japanese people. The Ainu and relative tribes lost most of their land in Honshū, many were killed or ensalved by the Yayoi-Japanese. After the rise of the Yamato, few Ainu were left in Honshu. After the Meiji restoration in the late 1800s, the Japanese began to colonize Hokkaido, sending their own people to live there. They forced the Ainu to leave the warm coast of Hokkaido and try to live in the mountains in the middle of the island. The Ainu were not allowed to fish for salmon or hunt deer. The Ainu were required to speak Japanese and use Japanese names. Japanese scientists and treasure hunters would dig up Ainu graves and steal the bodies and artifacts."
"The Ainu in Russia had more luck and lived their traditional life until the Second World War, when they were forced to act like other Russians."
"In April 2019, the Ainu became recognized as native population of northern Japan, and the rest of Japan has started to think of their culture as good and valuable. However, the Ainu still face discrimination in Japan. Most Japanese outside of Hokkaido mistake the Ainu for foreigners or tourists."
Culture.
"Their culture is based on the ancient Jomon culture of northern Japan and eastern Russia. Their native folk religion has some similarities to early Shinto. Their gods are named ""kamuy"", similar to the Japanese ""Kami"". They practiced agriculture but were also hunter gatherers. The Ainu are famous for their wood work and art."

Abdominal compartment syndrome
"Abdominal compartment syndrome occurs when the abdominal cavity (compartment) within the body becomes subject to increased pressure from within. This may be caused by internal bleeding, a blockage or fluid build-up in the intestines, or 'ascites' which is when fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity - the space between the lining of the abdomen (peritoneum) and the abdominal organs (the stomach, small and large intestines, pancreas, liver, and gallbladder)."
"This increased pressure causes the abdomen to distend or expand, stretching the skin and placing pressure on the abdominal organs, which can constrict the blood vessels which supply them. When the pressure reaches a level above that of the blood supply to the tissues and organs of the abdomen, ischemia will happen leading to organ dysfunction and eventually failure."
"An operation called a decompressive laparotomy may need to be performed, where an incision is made to open the abdominal cavity. The incision is typically left open for a period of time to reduce the pressure in the abdomen."
Abdominal compartment syndrome can be divided into three categories:

Bogotá bag
"A Bogotá bag is a sterile plastic bag used to temporarily close incisions in the abdomen. It is generally a sterilized, 3 liter urological irrigation fluid bag, that is sewn to the skin or fascia of the anterior abdominal wall. It is called a 'Bogotá bag' because it was first used by Oswaldo Borraez, a doctor in Bogotá, Colombia."
"This Murrinh-patha mythology is based on a view of life that believes life is ""...a joyous thing with maggots at its centre."". Life is good and caring, but during life's journey, there are many painful sufferings that each person must come to understand and live through as he grows. This is the message being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people reason and meaning in life."
"The following Murrinh-patha myth, for example, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood."
"""A woman, ""Mutjinga"" (the 'Old Woman'), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents' absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body."""
"Within the myth and in its performance, young children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being who changes into a giant snake. The children are then vomited up before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and benefits of young adults."
Pintupi people.
"The Pintupi peoples from Australia's Gibson Desert region have a mostly 'mythic' form of understanding their identity, All events happen and are explained by the social structures and rules told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology. That is, the structures of society come from the myths, not from their own political actions, decisions or influences of local individuals."
"""The Dreaming.. provides a moral authority lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied."""
"""Current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order."""
"Within this Pintupi view of the world, three long geographical tracks of named places control and guide society. They are interrelated strings of important places named and created by mythic characters on their way through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of stories, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as ""Tingarri"". It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country."

26th G8 summit
"On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the suggested Constitution. All 30 of the members of its Convention voted for the Constitution."
"On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to approve the Constitution. Now that nine states had ratified the Constitution, it became the highest and most important law of the United States. The United States would have a new form of government, based on the ideas set out in the Constitution."
Four states are still left.
"However, four states still had not approved the Constitution. These states were Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island. If they did not approve the Constitution, they would not be a part of the new government of the United States."
"The Congress of the Confederation decided that the United States would start using the new Constitution on March 4, 1789. Before that day, Virginia and New York ratified the Constitution. However, when the first United States Congress gathered on March 4 to form the new government, North Carolina and Rhode Island still had not approved the Constitution. After the new Congress added the Bill of Rights to the Constitution, though, North Carolina and Rhode Island ratified the Constitution."
Order of approval.
The Constitution was ratified by the states in this order:
Roberto Perfumo
"Roberto Alfredo Perfumo (3 October 1942 – 10 March 2016) was an Argentine footballer and sports commentator. He was nicknamed ""El Mariscal"". He was thought as one of the best Argentine defenders ever. Perfumo played for Racing, River Plate and Brazilian team Cruzeiro. With the national team, he played the 1966 and 1974 World Cups."

"Ferrer died in Buenos Aires on March 8, 2016. He was aged 88."
Article Six of the United States Constitution
"Article Six of the United States Constitution says that the Constitution, and any laws or treaties the United States might make, will be the most important laws in the United States. It also says that the United States will pay debts from before the Constitution was written. Finally, it says that members of the United States government have to swear that they will obey the Constitution. However, they will never have to swear that they follow a certain religion."
Debts.
"Before the United States Constitution was written, the United States had another constitution called the Articles of Confederation. The Articles made the states into a Confederation."
"The first part of Article Six says that the United States will still honor and pay all of its debts from before the Constitution was written. The Article says that ""these debts are as valid against the United States under this Constitution, as [they were] under the Confederation [governed by the Articles of Confederation]."""
Supremacy.
"The second clause of Article Six is often called the ""Supremacy Clause."" It says that these things are the ""supreme"" laws in the United States the most powerful and most important laws in the country:"
Because these laws are supreme:
"For example, part of the Constitution called the Bill of Rights gives people the right to freedom of religion. Because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land:"
Later in history.
A few Supreme Court decisions helped make the Supremacy Clause clearer.
"The first important case was ""Marbury v. Madison"" (1803). In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that it had the power to review state courts' decisions, if those decisions seemed like they did not follow the supreme law. This power is called judicial review."
"In ""Martin v. Hunter's Lessee"" (1816), the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was more powerful than the state Supreme Courts. In the case, the Virginia Supreme Court said that a United States Supreme Court decision was unconstitutional, and told all of the Virginia state courts not to obey it. The United States Supreme Court ruled that it had the final say in legal issues that had to do with federal laws not the state courts. If a state court and the United States Supreme Court disagree, the Supreme Court is the supreme law of the land."
"Three years later, in ""McCulloch v. Maryland"" (1819), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states cannot control federal institutions. The state of Maryland had tried to tax a federal bank. The Supreme Court ruled that states cannot tax government property. This was another example of a case where the U.S. Supreme Court decided that the ""supreme laws of the land"" were more powerful than state laws or court decisions."
"In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled on ""Gibbons v. Ogden"" (1824). The state of New York had given Aaron Ogden a monopoly over the steamboat business in the Hudson River. However, Thomas Gibbons got the same power from a federal government permit. The Supreme Court decided that the federal permit was more powerful than the state monopoly. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall wrote:"
"Finally, in ""Reid v. Covert"" (1957), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that no branch of the United States government can be given extra powers by a treaty, if those powers were not given to it by the Constitution. This case showed that the Constitution could even limit the power of treaties, and was truly the supreme law of the land."
Jnana yoga
"In Hinduism, Jnana Yoga is the yoga or practice of knowledge. Jyâna in Sanskrit means ""knowledge""."
"In the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says that jyâna consists of properly understanding ""kshetra"" (the field of activity—that is, the body) and ""kshetra-jna"" (the knower of the body—that is, the soul). Krishna emphasizes one must understand the difference between these two. ""Those who see with eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and can also understand the process of liberation from bondage in material nature, attain to the supreme goal."""
Atharva Veda
"The Atharva Veda is the fourth Veda, one of the Hindu scriptures. There are a number of upanishads in this veda. Ganapathy, Narayana, Devi, Atharva Siropanishaths are part of atharv veda. Bhavanopanisath is also in atharva veda. Sankaracharya established joshimath in kedarnath one of the four popal centres of Hinduism to flourish atharva veda."

E-book
"An electronic book (also called an e-book, ebook or digital book) is a book in digital form. E-books can be read on computers or other electronic devices such as e-book readers. E-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle, the Kobo eReader and the are devices which are dedicated to showing e-books."
History.
"The first e-book might have been the Index Thonisticus, prepared by Roberto Busa in the late 1940s. However, this is sometimes not called an ebook because the digital text was (at least at first) meant to develop an index and concordance, rather than as a published edition in its own rights."
"Despite the extensive earlier history, it is commonly reported that the inventor of the e-book is Michael S. Hart. In 1971, Hart was given extensive computer time by the operators of the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the University of Illinois. Seeking a worthy use of this resource, he created his first electronic document by typing the United States Declaration of Independence into a computer."
"One early e-book was the desktop prototype for a proposed notebook computer, the Dynabook, in the 1970s at PARC: a general-purpose portable personal computer capable of displaying books for reading."
"In 1992, Sony launched the Data Discman, an electronic book reader that could read e-books that were stored on CDs. One of the electronic publications that could be played on the Data Discman was called The Library of the Future."
"Early e-books were generally written for specialty areas and a limited audience, meant to be read only by small and devoted interest groups. The scope of the subject matter of these e-books included technical manuals for hardware, manufacturing techniques and other subjects. In the 1990s, the general availability of the Internet made transferring electronic files much easier, including e-books."
"The current eBook standard is the file. There are other proprietary formats like .MOBI, AZW, IBA and PDF."
Church–Turing thesis
"The Church-Turing thesis (also known as Church's thesis, Church's conjecture and Turing's thesis) is a statement about computers. It says that a very simple kind of computer now named a “Turing machine” is able to compute all computable functions. The Church-Turing thesis is linked to Gödel's incompleteness theorems."
"When a programming language is able to do what a Turing machine can do, that language is called Turing complete. If a problem is solvable in one such language, then it is solvable in all of those."
London Borough of Brent
The London Borough of Brent is a London borough in north west London and is part of Greater London.
Twyla Tharp

That ballet featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of the crossover ballet."
"Tharp has choreographed dances for many important ballet companies around the world. She also has had success on Broadway. In 1985, her staging of ""Singin' in the Rain,"" played at the Gershwin for 367 performances. Her dance musical ""Movin' Out"" ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway.

Chytridiomycosis
"Chytridiomycosis is a disease that can kill amphibians, for example frogs. A fungus causes it. THe chytrid fungus ""Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis"" causes the disease. The animals can catch it from each other. Chytridiomycosis one reason why there are fewer amphibians on Earth than there were. The fungus has decreased the amphibian population by 30% worldwide. Many spcies are now extict because they died of chitridiomycosis. In some species, only a few animals die, but in other species, they all die. This is called 100% mortality. There is no cure."
Temnospondyl
Temnospondyls are an order of small to giant batrachomorph tetrapods. They lived worldwide from the Carboniferous to the Triassic. A few species continued into the Lower Cretaceous.
"The Temnospondyls are similar or identical to the Labyrinthodonts minus the Lepospondyls. It is probably an evolutionary grade, not monophyletic. It is convenient to use, because all these early amphibia were so different from present-day amphibia.p169 Many in the early Permian looked more like reptiles because they were adapted to life in a drier climate. Nevertheless, they were amphibians, and many larval stages have been found."
"They are a large group of some 40 families and 160 genera.p322 Fossils have been found on every continent. Their evolutionary history spans 210 million years. During this time, they adapted to a wide range of habitats including fresh water, terrestrial, and even coastal marine environments."
"Fossils are known from the larval stage, metamorphosis, and maturity.p184 Most temnospondyls were semiaquatic, although some were almost fully terrestrial, returning to the water only to breed. These temnospondyls were some of the first vertebrates fully adapted to life on land. Although temnospondyls are considered amphibians, many had characteristics such as scales, claws, and armour-like bony plates which modern amphibians do not have."
The youngest known temnospondyl is the Australian Koolasuchus that lived about 120 million years ago during the Early Cretaceous.
Lepospondyl
The Lepospondyli are a large group of batrachomorph tetrapods from the Palaeozoic era. They are sometimes included in the Labyrinthodonts.
"They lived during the Carboniferous to the early Permian. There are six different groups. The Acherontiscidae, Adelospondyli, Aïstopoda, Lysorophia, Microsauria and Nectridea. The included species which looked somewhat like newts, eels, snakes and lizards. Some of them were aquatic, semi-aquatic, and terrestrial animals. None of them were big animals."
Peltobatrachus
"Peltobatrachus (from Greek pelte, meaning shield and batrakhos, meaning frog) is an extinct genus of temnospondyl amphibians from the late Permian period of Tanzania. They were large and slow-moving animals. They reached 70 centimeters (2.3 ft) in length. They were terrestrial amphibians. They only went back to the water to lay their eggs. They eat insects, worms and snails."
Terrestrial animal
"A terrestrial animal is an animal that lives on land such as dog, cat, an ant or an emu. It can also be used for some species of amphibians that only go back to the water to lay their eggs. It is usually a term to describe the difference between animals that live in water, (such as lobsters and fish), from animals that live on land."
Sister group
A sister group or sister taxon is a term used to describe the closest relatives of an organism (or other taxon) in a phylogenetic tree. It is a term in cladistics.
"The sister group of organism A is B. The sister group of the clade B+A, is C."
Political parties.
"Puerto Rico has three main political parties: the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which favors Puerto Rico becoming an independent nation; the New Progressive Party, which supports Puerto Rico's transition to becoming a state of the U.S; and the Popular Democratic Party, which supports Colonialism."
"The issue of the political status of the island (meaning whether it's a country, a U.S state, or a colony) is an issue of debate amongst the Puerto Rican people. In the past there have been many attempts to clearly define the island's political status by means of voting. Most of the time the majority of the people have chosen to remain a colony. However, in the last ""status voting"" the colonial option appeared to have lost well over 90% of its support, while the U.S state option has only gained strength in the last few decades. The Puerto Rican Independence party, on the other hand, has mainly lost a great deal of support within the last six decades."
Demographics.
"Puerto Rico is said to comprise a White majority, an extinct Amerindian population, persons of mixed ancestry, Africans and a small Asian minority. Recent genetic research, however, contradicts that information. According to the 2010 US Census, 99% of the population consider themselves of Puerto Rican descent (regardless of race or skin color), making Puerto Rico one of the most culturally unified societies in the world."
The population of Puerto Rico is nearly about 4 million people. The ethnic composition of the population is:
Culture.
Literature.
"Puerto Rico has a strong literary tradition. The most important playwrights are René Marqués (author of ""The Oxcart"") and Lin Manuel Miranda (creator of the Broadway musical ""Hamilton"").

Celebrated Puerto Rican novelists include Rosario Ferre (Eccentric Neighborhoods), Giannina Braschi (United States of Banana), and Esmeralda Santiago (When I Was Puerto Rican). Puerto Rican poets who live in New York are called Nuyorican poets."
Art.
"José Campeche (1751-1809) is the first known Puerto Rican painter. He painted in the best rococo style. Franciso Oller painted Puerto Rican landscapes and still life paintings the 19th Century. In the 20th century Franciso Rodón who paints portraits of celebrities. In the 21st century, Allora and Calzadilla are conceptual artists in San Juan, Puerto Rico."
Music.
"Puerto Rico music is often called Latin music. There are many popular styes of Puerto Rican dance music, including Salsa, Bomba, Plena, and R""eggaeton"". One of the most popular bands today is Calle 13. World famous Puerto Rican singers include Jennifer Lopez, Hector Lavoe, Tito Puentes, and Marc Anthony. Ricky Martin won the 1999 Grammy Award for ""Best Latin Pop Performance"" for Living La Vida Loca."
Philosophy.
"Puerto Rican philosophy deals with Puerto Rican independence, education, racism, and liberty for all. The first major Puerto Rican philosopher was Eugenio María de Hostos. He was born in the 19th Century in Puerto Rico. He believed that Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Cuba should unite to be free from Colonial powers. Francisco José Ramos was born in the 20th century. His philosophy deals with Ancient Greeks, American imperialism, and Buddhism. Giannina Braschi is a contemporary political philosopher. She writes about freedom, immigration, revolution, and justice. Braschi was inspired by a major Mexican woman philosopher Sor Juana Inez de la Cruz. Puerto Rican philosophers are sometimes called Latinx philosophers or Latin American philosophers."

"After their adventures in India, Short Round disappeared temporarily. He later grew up to become an archeologist. He went on an adventure in search of the Peacock Stone, the same diamond lost at the beginning of ""Temple of Doom""."
Pilgrimage
A pilgrimage is when people travel to a place of worship that is usually far away. They may have to go to a different city or country. Usually a pilgrimage is done for spiritual or religious reasons. The purpose of Christian pilgrimage was summarized by Pope Benedict XVI this way:
There are also non-religious pilgrimages; they include for example:
1703
"The year 1703 (MDCCIII) started on a Monday, (or a Thursday by the 11-day slower Julian calendar)."
Watermelon
"A watermelon (""Citrullus lanatus"") is a plant which was first domesticated in Africa. It is a cultivated edible fruit. It is grown worldwide, there are more than 1000 varieties."
"About 6% of a watermelon is sugar, which makes it very sweet. There are many different types of watermelon. Some have a green rind on the outside and a red-pink flesh on the inside, with brown seeds. Some can have yellow flesh, and some can be seedless. The green rind on the outside is not usually eaten, though it can be used as a vegetable. It can also be stewed or pickled. Most watermelons are oblong or spherical. In Japan, watermelons are grown in different shapes, such as hearts and squares."
Area code 312
"Area code 312 is an area code that is part of Illinois. It was one of the first area codes created in 1947. It initially covered the entire northeastern portion of Illinois, but after it was split by 708 in 1989, 630, 847, and 773, all in 1996, it now covers only downtown Chicago, with 708 and 773 covering the rest of Chicago.

Each civil government is led by an administrative magistrate ""and"" the civil governor (""Governador Civil""). The administrative magistrate is a delegate of the central government. The civil governor is chosen by the Council of Ministers. The civil government operated under the authority of the Ministry of Internal Administration."
"The role of Civil Governments has become smaller since their creation in 1835. At first, they had many powers as representatives of the central government . They also made certiain that all State services within the district worked together. They now serve as a local delegations of the Ministry of Internal Administration. Their responsibilties inclue issuing passports, public safety, and elections."
"In 2011, Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho ended all Civil Governments with Decree-Law No. 114/2011 of 30 November. That law gave all of the powers of the civil governments to other groups. These include the Municipal Chambers, the police, the National Republican Guard and the National Authority for Civil Protection). No civil governors have been appointed since this time but the post was created by the Constitution and still exists"

Minecraft PE
"Minecraft: Pocket Edition is a mobile version of Minecraft for phones and tablets. In 2011, Minecraft: Pocket Edition was released for the Android market as an early version. It was then released for other devices in October 2011. An iOS version was released on November 2011, and a port was made for Windows Phones after Microsoft bought Mojang. The port focuses on the basic building and the survival parts of the game, and does not have all the features of the PC version. On his Twitter account, Jens Bergensten said that the Pocket Edition of Minecraft is in C++ and not Java code, because of iOS not being able to support Java code. However, there now exists a way to play Java Edition on both Android and iOS devices."
"Minecraft: Pocket Edition was replaced by Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on December 19, 2016."
List of Secretaries of State of the United States
This is a list of secretaries of state of the United States.

John Jay was the Secretary of State until Thomas Jefferson came back from France.
Secretaries of state.
"On September 15, 1789, Washington made a law that changed the name of the office from Secretary of Foreign Affairs to Secretary of State and he changed the name of the department to the Department of State. He also added many powers and responsibilities to the secretary and the department. Thomas Jefferson was the first Secretary of State on March 22, 1790."
List of secretaries of state by time in office.
This is a list of United States secretaries of state by time in office. This is based on the difference between dates; if counted by number of calendar days all the figures would be one greater. Cordell Hull is the only person to have served as Secretary of State for more than eight years. Daniel Webster and James G. Blaine are the only secretaries of state to have ever served non-consecutive terms. Warren Christopher served very briefly as Acting Secretary of State non-consecutively with his later tenure as full-fledged Secretary of State. Elihu B. Washburne served as Secretary of State for less than two weeks before becoming Ambassador to France.
"Casineria was a tetrapod which lived 340 million years ago (mya) in the Mississippian. It was a small animal, length about 15 centimeters."
It lived in what was then a fairly dry environment in what is now Scotland. It had a mosaic of 'basal' (= primitive) amphibian and 'derived' (= advanced) amniote characters.
"""Casineria"" was at or very near the origin of the amniotes. It may have been one of the very first true amniotes. The only fossil lacks key elements: most of the skull and the whole lower body is missing. This makes exact analysis difficult."
"""Casineria"" was an insectivore. This earliest amniote had five fingers with claws on each hand, and marks the earliest known clawed foot."
"Its name, ""Casineria"", is a latin version of ""Cheese Bay"", the site near Edinburgh, where it was found."
Discovery.
"In 1992, an amateur fossil collector spotted the remains of this four-legged creature on the shore of Cheese Bay, Scotland. For the next five years, the fossil waited at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh while researchers focused on other projects. In 1997, work began to expose the remainder of the fossil from the surrounding matrix of stone."
The work revealed that the animal probably lived in an environment much drier than previously understood. The findings were first reported in 1999.
Phylogenetic relationship.
"""Casineria"" shows features that ties it in with early tetrapods, notably a generally gracile (slim) build with light leg-bones, unfused ankles and toes ending in claws. This would enable the animal to use their feet actively in traction, rather than as holdfasts. This indicates a mainly terrestrial lifestyle. These traits shows it was closely related to amniotes."
"With its advanced features, ""Casineria"" may have been one of the very first true amniotes, that is, egg-layers before the split between Synapsids and Sauropsids. ""Casineria"" pushes back the origin of amniote lineages much further than was previously realized."
"""Casineria"" and its relatives were perhaps the first vertebrates to live and reproduce on land."
Protoclepsydrops
"Protoclepsydrops was an early amniote from about 314 million years ago. Its remains were found at the Joggins Fossil Cliffs World Heritage Site. The dating of this site has been debated, with dates from 320 million years ago (mya) to 305 mya being suggested.p39 It is now settled as 314.5–313.4 mya +/- 1.1 million years.p40"
"The skeletal remains of ""Protoclepsydrops"" suggest it may have been a synapsid. If so, it is the oldest synapsid known, though its status is unconfirmed because its remains were fragmentary. ""Protoclepsydrops"" lived slightly earlier than ""Archaeothyris"", which was definitely a synapsid. Like ""Archaeothyris"", ""Protoclepsydrops"" had a body shape which resembled modern lizards."
Paleothyris
"Paleothyris was a small, agile, anapsid reptile which lived in the Pennsylvanian epoch in Nova Scotia (about 312 to 304 million years ago)."
"""Paleothyris"" had sharp teeth and large eyes: it was a nocturnal hunter. It was about a foot long. It probably fed on insects and other smaller animals found on the floor of its forest home."
"""Paleothyris"" was an early sauropsid, yet it still had some features that were more labyrinthodont-like than reptile-like. Its skull lacked fenestrae, holes found in the skulls of most reptiles and mammals."
Amy Brenneman
"Amy Frederica Brenneman (born June 22, 1964) is an American producer and actor. She is best known for starring in ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Judging Amy"". She has also starred in many movies. She was born in Connecticut."
Westlothiana
"Westlothiana lizziae is an early tetrapod. It is a transitional fossil, with a mixture of amphibian and early amniote characters.282 Its body shape had a superficial resemblance to modern-day lizards. It lived during the Carboniferous period, about 350 million years ago."
"The type specimen was discovered in East Kirkton Quarry, Bathgate, Scotland, in 1984. It was named after the County of West Lothian where it was found."
"""Westlothiania"" in life."
"This species probably lived near a freshwater lake, probably hunting for other small creatures that lived in the same habitat. It was a slender animal, with rather small legs and a long tail."
"Together with ""Casineria"", another transitional fossil found in Scotland, it is one of the smallest terapods known, being a mere 20 cm in adult length."
"The small size has made it a key fossil in the search for the earliest amniote, as amniote eggs are thought to have evolved in very small animals. There are derived (advanced) features which tie it in with the amniotes rather than amphibians. These are: unfused ankle bones, lack of labyrinthodont infolding of the dentine in teeth, a lack of an otic notch and a generally small skull."
"They are made from sweet yeast dough fried in fat or oil, with a marmalade or jam filling and usually icing, powdered sugar or conventional sugar on top. They are sometimes made with chocolate, champagne, custard, mocha, or ""advocaat"" filling, or with no filling at all. The filling is injected with a large syringe after the pastry is fried."
Naming.
"The name of the doughnut is different in various areas of Germany. Most areas in German speaking regions call it a ""Berliner"". Residents of Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony often know them as ""Pfannkuchen"", which in the rest of Germany generally means pancakes - pancakes are known there as ""Eierkuchen"" (lit. egg cakes). In parts of southern and central Germany (Bavaria), as well as in much of Austria, they are a variety of ""Krapfen""; in Hessen they are referred to as ""Kräppel"" or ""Kreppel"", or, in Palatinate, ""Fastnachtsküchelchen"" (literally: ""little carnival cakes"")."
"In South Tirol, part of northern Italy, the food is called ""krafen"" or ""krapfen"". In Slovenia, it is ""krof""; in Croatia ""krafne""; in Bosnia, and Serbia ""krofne"". In Poland they are known as ""pączki"", in the Czech Republic as kobliha. In Hungary, it is called ""fánk"". All of these are essentially identical preparations. In Spain it is called ""Berlinesa"". In the Netherlands it is called ""Berlinerbol"". IN France it is called ""Boule de Berlin""."
"In English-speaking countries, Berliners are often called doughnuts and are usually filled with jam, jelly, custard or whipped cream. However, in South Australia, the Kitchener bun is a Berliner cut on the side for the filling of jam and cream. In Anglophone North America, the most common term for the jam- or jelly-filled pastry is ""jelly doughnut"". The name is somewhat misleading, since the jam or jelly used is specially made with less pectin, so that it does not ""set"" like jams and jellies manufactured for table use but has a consistency comparable to Bavarian cream."
The cream or custard-filled variety usually also feature chocolate icing and are sometimes called Bavarian cream or Boston cream doughnuts (the latter name from its resemblance to Boston cream pie). The Boston cream doughnut has been designated the official state doughnut of Massachusetts.
"In Ontario and the prairie western provinces of Canada, as well as parts of the Midwest in the U.S., such a round jelly- or custard-filled doughnut is commonly called a ""Bismarck,"" while a filled bar doughnut is called a ""Long John"", and usually contains pastry creme, custard or whipped cream but can contain a jelly filling. Other Canadian terms include ""jambuster"" in Manitoba, and ""Burlington bun"" in Nova Scotia."
New Year's Eve.
"Berliners are traditionally eaten to celebrate on New Year's Eve (""Silvester"") as well as the carnival holidays (Mardi Gras). A common German practical joke is to secretly fill some Berliners with mustard instead of jam and serve them together with regular Berliners without telling anyone."
Variations.
"In Portugal, berliners are slightly bigger than their German counterparts. They are known as ""bolas de Berlim"" (Berlin ball) and the filling is always an egg-yolk- based yellow cream called ""creme pasteleiro"" (lit. confectioner's cream). The filling is inserted after a half- length cut and is always visible. Regular sugar is used to sprinkle on it. They can be found in almost every pastry shop in the country."
"Such versions are also found in Latin America, in Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, where it's not only filled with custard (called ""Crema pastelera""), but with jam (especially red ones) or manjar blanco. In Brazil, berliners are called ""sonhos"" (dreams) and traditionally filled with yellow cream (called simply ""creme""). Some modern variants filled with ""doce de leite"" (a type of milk jam), or a mix of chocolate and ""doce de leite"", can be found in Rio de Janeiro's bakeries."
"In Israel, a version of the pastry called ""sufganiyah"" is traditionally eaten during the holiday of Hanukkah. While sufganiyot are usually filled with jam, many modern variants exist."
Campbell University
"Campbell University is a private, coeducational baptist university in Buies Creek, North Carolina. The university has about 10,471 students. It was founded in 1887. The current president of the university is Jerry M. Wallace."
Sports.
"The athletics teams of the university are called the Fighting Camels. They have 18 varsity teams which mostly compete in the Big South Conference. Despite the Big South sponsoring football, the Campbell football team plays in the Pioneer Football League (PFL). That league is made up of schools that choose not to offer scholarships for football, despite offering them in other sports."

Garry Kasparov
"Garry Kasparov (born 13 April 1963 in Baku, Azerbaijan) is a Russian chess grandmaster and political activist. He was born with the name ""Garry Weinstein"", and is partly of Jewish descent. He was the World Chess Champion from 1985 to 2000. In 1993 he broke away from FIDE to make a rival organisation (the PCA), because he felt FIDE had failed to raise enough money for world title matches. There is controversy about that period. By any measure, he is one of the greatest chess players of all time, and was the highest-rated player even after his retirement, It was till much later when Magnus Carlsen took him over."
"Kasparov became the youngest non-disputed World Chess Champion in 1985 at the age of 22. He held the official FIDE world title until 1993, when an argument with FIDE led him to set up a rival company, the Professional Chess Association. He continued to hold the ""Classical"" World Chess Championship until his defeat by Vladimir Kramnik in 2000. Kasparov lost a match (a series of chess games) against ""Deep Blue"", a computer made by IBM, in 1997. Lately, retired from competition, he has been coaching Magnus Carlsen, the young player from Norway who is the current world #1."
Politics.
"After retiring from chess, Kasparov became involved in Russian politics. In 2005, he traveled around Russia, speaking against Vladimir Putin, who was President of Russia at that time. The same year he created the United Civil Front, a political movement whose main goal is to dismantle Putin's regime and restore democracy in Russia."
"Kasparov was also one of the founders of The Other Russia, an opposition coalition which unites many left and nationalist politicians. He helped organize marches of dissenters involving several thousand people rallying against Putin and governors of Moscow and Saint Petersburg."
"In October 2007, Kasparov announced his intention of standing for the Russian presidency. In November 2007, he was detained by police at a rally in Moscow and given a jail sentence of five days. On 12 December 2007, Kasparov announced that he had to withdraw his presidential candidacy due to inability to rent a hall where at least 500 of his supporters could meet to endorse his candidacy, as is legally required. Kasparov's spokeswoman accused the government of using pressure to discourage anyone from renting a hall for the gathering. In 2008 Kasparov and his United Civil Front joined the Solidarity movement."
Kasparov is among the 34 first signatories and a key organiser of the online anti-Putin campaign Putin must go started in March 2010.
Stanley Vann
"Stanley Vann (born Leicester, 15 February 1910 - 27 March 2010) was an English composer, organist, choral conductor, and choir trainer. He contributed a great deal to music in the Anglican church tradition. He was Director of Music at Peterborough Cathedral from 1953 to 1977. On 15 February 2010 he celebrated his 100th birthday. He died the following month."
Early life.
"Vann was born in Leicester. He started to learn the piano when he was about six years old. At the age of 17 he learned the organ, and by the time he was 20 he had passed his ARCM, ARCO and FRCO organ diplomas."
The start of a musical career.
"In 1931 he became Assistant Organist at Leicester Cathedral. In 1933 he became Organist at Gainsborough Parish Church, then went to Leamington Spa as Organist of Holy Trinity church in 1939. He started a choir and an orchestra there: the Leamington Spa Bach Choir and the Warwickshire Symphony Orchestra."
Between 1942 and 1946 he had to fight in the Second World War.
"In 1949 he got the jobs of Organist at Chelmsford Cathedral and Professor of Harmony and Counterpoint at Trinity College, London. In Chelmsford he started the Essex Symphony Orchestra."
He also trained the Leicester Philharmonic choir for the famous conductors Henry Wood and Malcolm Sargent.
Peterborough.
"In 1909 Vann became Master of the Music in Peterborough Cathedral. He stayed in this job until he retired in 1977. The choir was not particularly good when he started there, but he soon made them into an excellent choir. They made many recordings. In 1971 he was given a Lambeth doctorate by the Archbishop of Canterbury for his services to music."
"When he retired he first moved to Wansford in Cambridgeshire so that he was half way between his son (in Yorkshire) and his daughter (in Berkshire). He continued to work there, training the church choir, giving singing lessons, and composing. Later he moved to Yorkshire to be nearer to family. He died aged 100 after falling down and breaking his hip."
Compositions.
"Stanley Vann composed a great deal of music, mostly for the Anglican church service. His compositions include hymn tunes, anthems, motets, chants, organ music and many other pieces. One of his largest pieces is the Billingshurst Mass, for large chorus and orchestra. It was first performed in Chichester Cathedral in 2000."
"In 2000 a concert was given in All Saints Church, Peterborough to celebrate his 90th birthday. On Sunday 14 February 2010 many cathedrals and churches in England arranged special concerts and services to celebrate his 100th birthday"
". The BBC broadcast a special choral evensong on Radio 3 on Wednesday 24 February from Peterborough Cathedral (Wednesday 17 February is Ash Wednesday, so that a lot of his music would not have been suitable.)."
There is a scholarship in his name for young choir trainers and directors in the Anglican tradition.
Royal College of Organists
"The Royal College of Organists or RCO, is an organisation based in the United Kingdom, but with members around the world. Its job is to support organ playing and choral music. People who learn the organ can go there to take professional organ examinations."
"There is a large library with more than 60,000 books about organ playing and organ music."
"When the RCO started in 1864 by Richard Limpus it was called the ""College of Organists"". It was given a Royal Charter in 1893. In 1903 it was offered an extremely cheap 99-year lease on a beautiful building in Kensington, West London. The college was there until 1991 when it moved to a church in the City of London. In 2003 it moved again to Birmingham."
"The population of Trieste, practically nearly all Italian, promoted this union of the city to Italy in 1918, and since the end of WWI the city has been the capital of the Italian region called ""Venezia Giulia""."
"The population is 207.069 ab. (2004). It was nearly 300,000 after WWII because many Italian refugees flooded the city as a consequence of the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus."
"These days, Trieste is important because of its shipbuilding industry, science parks, universities and ""history on the border of western Europe"". Trieste will be connected to the Italian ""TAV railway"" (High Speed) network: a 300 km/hour (186 mph) fast train route is going to connect Trieste with Venice in the next few years."
Economy.
"During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth largest and most important center in the Empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. However the economy of Trieste fell into a small decline after the city's annexation to Italy following World War I, because it was cut off from the ""Mittleurope""."
"But Fascist Italy promoted a huge development of Trieste in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities related even to naval and armament industries (like the famous ""Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)""). Allied bombings during WWII destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards)."
"As a consequence Trieste was a mainly peripheral city during the Cold War. However, since the 1970s, Trieste has had a huge economic boom, thanks to a significant commercial shipping business to the container terminal, steel works and an oil terminal."
"Trieste is also Italy's and Mediterranean's (and one of Europe's) greatest coffee ports, as the city supplies more than 40% of Italy's coffee. Coffee brands, such as Illy, were founded and are headquartered in the city. Currently, Trieste is one of Europe's most important ports and centres for trade and transport, with Trieste being part of the ""Corridor 5"" plan, to create a bigger transport connection between Western and Eastern European countries."
Offenbach am Main
"Offenbach is a city in the German state of Hesse. It is on the river Main near Frankfurt am Main. The city has about 120,000 people. The ""Deutscher Wetterdienst"" (German weather service) is in Offenbach."
Economy.
"Until the early 1970s the economy of Offenbach was mainly the machine-building and leather industries. The city is the home of the German Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies until today."
Twinned cities.
Offenbach has the following twin cities:
Heilbronn
"Heibronn ( ]; , local dialect: ""Hallbrunn"", ""Haalbrunn"") is a city in Germany in the state of Baden-Württemberg. With about 117,000 people, Heilbronn is the sixth largest town in Baden-Württemberg."
Heilbronn is also on the river Neckar and is known for the wine which was grown in their region and the Kätchen a famous sign.
Hildesheim
"is a city in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is in the district of Hildesheim and is about 30 km southeast of Hanover. The city is on the banks of the River Innerste, which is a smaller river that flows into the River Leine. It can be reached from Autobahn A7, which links Kassel, Göttingen and Hanover."
"It has about 110,000 people living there."
History.
"Hildesheim is one of the oldest cities in North Germany. The city may have been founded when the bishop moved from Elze to the Innerste ford, where it was an important market on the Hellweg trade route. The settlement soon grew into a town which was granted market rights by King Otto III in 983. Originally the market was held on a street called Old Market (""Alter Markt""), which still exists today. The first market place was laid out around Saint Andrew's Church. As the city grew larger, a larger market place became more important. The current market place in Hildesheim was made at the start of the 13th century when the city had a population of about 5,000. When Hildesheim obtained city rights in 1249, it was one of the largest cities in Northern Germany. For four centuries the clergy ruled Hildesheim, before a city hall was built and the citizens gained some influence and independence. Construction of the present City Hall started in 1268, and in 1367 Hildesheim became a member of the Hanseatic League. A war between the citizens and their bishop cost dearly in 1519-1523 when they engaged in a feud. Hildesheim became Protestant in 1542, and only the cathedral and a few other buildings remained in Imperial (Roman Catholic) hands. Several villages around the city remained Roman Catholic as well. In 1813, after the Napoleonic Wars, the town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 as a province."
"The city was bombed in World War II, but the bombing had little importance in the course of the war. 28.5% of the houses were destroyed and 44.7% damaged. 26.8% of the houses had no damage. The center, which still had its medieval character until then, was almost levelled. As in many cities, priority was given to rapid building of badly needed housing, and concrete structures took the place of the destroyed buildings. Fortunately, most of the major churches, two of them now UNESCO World Heritage Sites, were rebuilt in the original style soon after the war. During the war, valuable world heritage materials had been hidden in the basement of the city wall. In 1978, the University of Hildesheim was founded. In the 1980s a reconstruction of the historic center began. Some of the new concrete buildings near the marketplace were torn down. Replicas of the original buildings were built in their place."

Flash memory
"Flash memory is a memory storage device for computers and electronics. It is most often used in devices like digital cameras, USB flash drives, and video games. It was developed in the 1980s from the earlier and similar EEPROM."
"Flash memory is different from RAM because RAM is volatile (not permanent). When power is turned off, RAM loses all its data. Flash can keep its data intact with no power at all. A hard drive is also permanent (non-volatile) storage, but it is bulky and fragile. Flash memory is one kind of Non-volatile random-access memory. It is slower than RAM but faster than hard drives. It is often used in small electronics because of its small size and lack of moving parts."
"The main weakness of flash memory is that it is more expensive than hard drives for the same amount of storage. Another weakness is the number of times that data can be written to it. Data can be read from flash as many times as desired, but after a certain number of ""write"" operations, ""write cycles"", it will stop working. Most flash devices are designed for about 100,000 - 1,000,000 write cycles."
"EEPROM has the same limitation that flash does: ones made in the 20th century could only survive about 100,000 write cycles, later increased to about a million. It is more expensive than flash, so it is rarely used for storage greater than 128kB. The main difference between EEPROM and flash memory is that most EEPROM devices can erase any byte of memory at any time. Flash memory can only erase an entire chunk, or ""sector"", of memory at a time. Both EEPROM and flash are subject to the limitation that only bytes in an 'erased' state can be written, which means that if the user wants to change only one byte of flash, the entire sector must be erased and re-written. This means that flash memory can wear out faster than EEPROM. Some flash memory can store hundreds of gigabytes, or even terabytes. Many are in the form of a pen drive."
"Flash memory is used in USB Drives, solid-state drives, computer RAM (occasionally), hybrid drives (small SSD + hard drive), graphics cards, and memory cards."
Bottrop
"Bottrop is a city in west central Germany, on the Rhine-Herne Canal, in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (Nordrhein-Westfalen). Bottrop is in the Ruhr industrial area, It is next to Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck and Dorsten. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center. There are factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. The population is currently 119,655. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s and was chartered as a city in 1921. In 1975 it was put together with the unification with the neighbor communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left in 1976."
History.
"The place is first heard of in 1150, as ""Borthorpe"". This name means ""village on the hillside"". In the year 1423, Bottrop is awarded the status of a market town. In 1786 the first cotton mill opens. Coal mining starts in 1856. The city gets town privileges in 1919. In 1953, the population passed 100.000 people for the first time."
"Moore is also a cast member of the 2016 American dramedy series ""This Is Us""."
Oiran
"were courtesans in Japan. Oiran were part of Japanese society during the Edo Period, (1600–1868). Prostitution was legal then, but only in special neighborhoods that were closed to outsiders. There were different kinds of oiran, depending on their beauty, skills in art, education, and more. High-ranking oiran were called . Only nobles could be with one. Tayū had many servants, and when they went outside, their servants carried them and followed them, making a procession. They wore very expensive clothes and jewelry. Any man who wished to be with an oiran had to follow difficult rituals and etiquette."
Geisha replaced oiran. Geisha practiced common types of entertainment enjoyed by the people of that time. They became more popular than oiran. The last known oiran was in 1761. A few women still practice the arts of the oiran today (without sex) to continue the cultural heritage.
Ryōtei
"A is a type of very expensive and elegant Japanese restaurant. Traditionally they only accept new customers who are recommended by known and trusted clients. They usually include entertainment by geisha, but not always in modern times. Ryōtei are usually a place where very important business or political meetings can take place in private."
Philharmonia
The Philharmonia is an orchestra from London.
History.
"The orchestra was formed in 1945 by Walter Legge. Legge was not a conductor, but he was a man who organized a lot of music, especially recordings. The orchestra spent most of their time making gramophone recordings, but sometimes they also gave concerts. The conductor Thomas Beecham led their first concert in 1946, but Beecham had always organized his own orchestras and he wanted to organize this one. He even wanted to change the orchestra’s name. The players decided that they did not want Beecham as their conductor. Beecham went on to form another orchestra which he called the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra."
"In the first years of the Philharmonia they were conducted by several world-famous conductors, including Arturo Toscanini, Wilhelm Furtwängler and, especially, Herbert von Karajan. Karajan helped the orchestra to become one of the finest in the world, and he made many recordings with them, including all the Beethoven symphonies."
"In 1954 Karajan left to conduct the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Legge found another world-famous conductor, Otto Klemperer. Although he was already quite old, Klemperer made many excellent recordings with the orchestra. In 1959 the orchestra gave Klemperer the title of Music Director for the rest of his life."
"In 1964 Legge thought the orchestra had done enough recordings and he was going to bring it to an end. Both the orchestra and Klemperer wanted it to continue, so the orchestra made their own organizing body (like other London orchestras) and they continued, calling themselves by a new name: the ""New Philharmonia Orchestra"". They gave their first concert under their new name on 27 October 1964. It was a performance of Beethoven's ""Symphony No. 9"", conducted by Klemperer."
"The orchestra gave many more concerts after it became self-governing than it had when Legge had been organizing them. Continuing as the New Philharmonia Orchestra, it got its old name “Philharmonia Orchestra” back again in 1977, and has been known by that name ever since."
"Klemperer retired from conducting in 1971, but was officially still its principal conductor until his death in 1973. Since then the orchestra has been conducted by Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, Giuseppe Sinopoli, Christoph von Dohnányi and Esa-Pekka Salonen who has conducted them since 2008."
Concerts Today.
"Today, the orchestra continues to give many concerts, travelling around Britain as well as abroad. Since 1995 they have been based in the Royal Festival Hall in London. They also give regular concerts at De Montfort Hall, Leicester and the Corn Exchange, Bedford. Abroad they often play in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris and the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam."
Recordings.
"The Philharmonia has made more than one thousand recordings. It has also been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including such classics as Laurence Olivier's 1944 film version of Shakespeare's ""Henry V"", and David Lean's film version of ""Oliver Twist"" (1948)."
Taiko
"means simply ""drum"" in Japanese. Outside Japan, the word is used to refer to any of the different kinds of Japanese drums (, ""wadaiko"", ""Japanese drum"" in Japanese) and to the more or less new art of taiko drumming bands (sometimes better called, ""kumi-daiko"", ). The taiko drum originated in the country of Japan. This drum was created by Daihachi Oguchi in 1951. The taiko drum makes a very loud, deep sound."
"In a traditional Japanese village the ""odaiko"" (big drum) defined the extent of the village land. In modern Japan, wadaiko has become more of a performance art, seen only during festivals or in concert. The most famous Wadaiko performance group are 'Kodo' (meaning heart-beat). They are not only the worlds most respected Japanese drumming group, they also maintain many traditional art forms. They group lives on the island 'Sado Higashima' and live together as a community in a traditional way. Many other cultures have adopted this style of drumming, from Germany and the United States to Australia."
Kitagawa Utamaro
"Kitagawa Utamaro (;  – 31 October 1806), also called Utamaro, was a Japanese artist. He was a master of the ukiyo-e style of woodblock prints and painting."
Career.
"Utamaro is known for his studies of women (""bijinga""). He also made nature studies."
His work was popular in Europe. He influenced artists in Europe who were called Impressionists.
"An Electro-optic modulator is an optical device. It is made of a material that has a so-called ""electro-optical effect"". This means that the material changes its optical properties when there is an electric field. One example is then when there is no electricity, light can pass through, and when there is, it cannot, and is reflected."
Liquid crystal
"Liquid crystals are special substances that are usually liquid, but that show certain properties of a solid crystal. A liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be rotated in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid crystal phases. Different phases are different because their optical properties are different. Using a microscope and a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will have different textures. This is also shown in the image."
"The contrasting areas in the texture each correspond to a domain where the LC molecules are rotated in a different direction. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in an LC phase (just as water is not always in the liquid phase: it may also be found in the solid and gaseous phase)."
Liquid crystal displays use the optical properties of liquid crystals to control light.
Turing complete
"Turing complete is a term used in computability theory to describe abstract machines, usually called automata. Such an automaton is Turing complete, if it can be used to emulate a Turing machine. It is also called computationally universal."
"Most modern programming languages are Turing-complete. There are languages that are used to classify and describe the contents of documents; for example HTML. HTML is not Turing complete, because it cannot actively change the state of the system. HTML can be combined with a technology such as JavaScript; both together can be made Turing complete. The standard regular expressions, which most programming languages use, are not Turing complete either. Most regular expression engines have been adapted to include back-references. The problem with this is that a finite automaton cannot handle back references."
River Trent
The River Trent is one of the major rivers of England. It is the third longest river in the United Kingdom. It starts in Staffordshire. It flows through the centre of England until it joins the River Ouse to form the River Humber (estuary) which empties into the North Sea.
"The name ""Trent"" comes from a Celtic word possibly meaning ""strongly flooding"". More specifically, the name may be a contraction of two Celtic words, ""tros"" (""over"") and ""hynt"" (""way"")."
"It is unusual amongst English rivers in that it flows north (for the second half of its route), and is also unusual in exhibiting a tidal bore, the ""Aegir"". The area drained by the river includes most of the northern Midlands."
Navigation.
"The river is legally navigable for some below Burton upon Trent. However, for practical purposes, navigation above the southern terminus of the Trent and Mersey Canal (at Shardlow) is conducted on the canal, rather than on the river itself."
Trent Aegir.
"At certain times of the year, the lower tidal reaches of the Trent experience a tidal bore which can be up to high."
Kirkcudbrightshire
Kirkcudbrightshire is a Scottish county on the Solway Firth in the south-west of Scotland.
Its county town is Kirkcudbright.
"Kirkcudbrightshire was known by other names in the past: East Galloway because it is the eastern part of the old Kingdom of Galloway, and the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright, because it was once governed by a steward employed by the Lord of Galloway and not a sheriff appointed by the king."
"Kirkcudbrightshire is named after the town of Kirkcudbright, which means ""Cuthbert's church""."
Villages.
"For local government, the county is in the Dumfries and Galloway council area."

Equity premium puzzle.
"Equity premium puzzle(EPP) refers to the problem of why there is a big difference between returns in stocks and risk-free investments historically. Since stocks are much riskier than government bonds, the underinvestment in stocks relative to bonds supports the idea of loss aversion theory. Specifically, it's the myopic loss aversion introduced by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler, which indicates the behavioural characteristics of ""loss aversion"" and ""frequent evaluations"" of investors. Benartzi and Thaler argue that loss-averse investors are more willing to take risks if they do not evaluate the performance of their investments frequently. In their model, investors are unwilling to accept return variability and tend to take a short-term view of their wealth."
Demand elasticity.
"Demand is more elastic for price increases than price decreases, based on the assumption that the price increase is a loss while the price decrease is a gain for consumers."
Daniel Kahneman's contributions.
Prospect theory.
"Based on the principle of loss aversion, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Twersky developed prospect theory to explain how consumers make decisions in uncertain situations. Unlike the hypothesis of rational man use in economics, prospect theory reveals the irrational psychological factors that affect the choice behaviour. Most people are unwilling to take risks when facing gains but become risk-seeking in losses."
Endowment effect.
"Loss aversion theory explains the endowment effect. The endowment effect refers to the finding that once an individual owns a good, he/she tends to naturally place more value than he did before he didn't own it. Due to the asymmetric responses to losses and gains in the decision-making process, the consideration of ""loss avoidance"" is far greater than that of ""gain seeking,"" so people value more on a good they own."
Real world applications: Marketing Strategy.
"By using the loss aversion theory as a marketing strategy, firms are able to gain higher profits by changing consumers' behaviours. For example:"
RTÉ One
"RTÉ One () is a television channel in Ireland. It is the main TV channel of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ). It is the most popular channel in Ireland. It started in 31 December 1961 and was called ""Telefís Éireann"". It was the first TV channel in Ireland. It was called ""RTÉ"" from 1966, and ""RTÉ 1"" from 1978 when RTÉ 2 started. The channel was only in black and white between 1961 and 1968. From 1968, some programmes were broadcast in PAL colour."
"Some of the money for the channel comes from a government television licence, and the rest comes from advertisements. RTÉ channels have fewer advertisements than other channels because of this. RTÉ One can be watched by 98% of people in Ireland in HD on the Saorview digital service. It can also be watched on Freeview, Sky, Virgin Media, and online through RTÉ Player."
Coat of arms of Lesotho
"The Coat of arms of Lesotho was adopted in 2006, after Lesotho's 40th anniversary of independence, replacing the original one used from 1966 to 2006."
Pelton wheel
"The pelton wheel is a kind of water turbine. It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight. Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear: Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water."
Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics
"The football competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics was the first Olympic football tournament dedicated to under-23 teams. The competition featured 16 men's national sides from the six continental confederations. The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four and each group played a round-robin tournament. At the end of the group stage, the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage, beginning with the quarter-finals and culminating with the gold medal match at Camp Nou on 8 August 1992."
Qualification.
The following 16 teams qualified for the 1992 Olympic men's football tournament:

Erlasee Solar Park
"The Erlasee Solar Park is in one of the sunniest regions of Germany. On the former wine-producing Erlasee estate near Arnstein in Bavaria, in southern Germany, SOLON has constructed what is currently the largest tracking photovoltaic solar power station in the world with an output of 12 MW. Just under 1,500 ""SOLON-Movers"" modules convert sunlight into environmentally friendly power, generating as much as the average consumption of the nearby town of Arnstein."
The solar power plant cost £35 million and covers 77 hectares of land.
Khula
Khula is the right of a woman to ask her husband for a divorce and to offer him a compensation in case he does so. Following the Sharia the husband has no right to ask for a compensation of a higher value than that what he gave his wife when they married.
"After divorce the former husband is responsible for education, food and residence of children. The children live with the mother for 7 years. After 7 years children have the right to live with father or mother, as they decide."
Hashemi Rafsanjani
"Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (, ""Akbar Hāshemī Rafanjānī""), Hashemi Bahramani (; August 25, 1934 – January 8, 2017) was an influential Iranian politician. He has been the Chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council of Iran from 1989 until his death in 2017."
"""Forbes"" magazine listed Rafsanjani in their list of richest people in the world and has written that as the real power behind the Iranian government, he ""has more or less run the Islamic Republic for the past 24 years."" His wealth has earned him the infamous nickname of ""Akbar Shah"" in Iran."
"Rafsanjani was President of Iran from 1989 to 1997, losing on the second ballot to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the 2005 election on his attempt for a third term in office. After this, he has tried to use his position in the Expediency Council to denounce President Ahmadinejad's administration. He said he would do some privatizations and change foreign policy. However, President Ahmadinejad has noted Rafsanjani's failure to make a difference between privatization and self takeover of government-owned companies. Ahmadinejad has also commmented on the foreign policies of Rafsanjani's administration which lead to sanctions against Iran in 1995 and 1996."
"Currently, one of his sons has been accused of receiving a bribe. Analysts expect that his son will not be put on trial, however."
"Rafsanjani died on January 8, 2017 in Tehran from a heart attack, aged 82."
Evander Holyfield
"Evander Holyfield (born October 19, 1962) is an American boxer. He held both the world heavyweight championship and the world cruiserweight championship. He also won a bronze medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics."
"Holyfield was born in Atmore, Alabama. He became a professional boxer in 1984 and won the cruiserweight championship from Dwight Muhammad Qawi in 1986. He moved to the heavyweight division in 1988 and won the world championship from James ""Buster"" Douglas in 1990. He defended the title three times, including fights against former champions Larry Holmes and George Foreman. He lost the title to Riddick Bowe in 1992 but won it back the next year. In 1994 he lost to Michael Moorer and briefly retired. He soon fought again, however, and surprised many by knocking out Mike Tyson in 1996. He had a draw against Lennox Lewis in 1998 and then lost a rematch to him in 1999."
"In 2005, Holyfield was a contestant on season 1 of ""Dancing with the Stars"". He was a housemate in the January 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK)."

"Porthmadog Football Club is a football team, playing in the League of Wales. The club was started in 1884."
Sharia
"Sharia, Sharia law or Islamic law is a set of religious principles which form part of the Islamic culture. The Arabic word ""sharīʿah"" () refers to the revealed law of God and originally meant ""way"" or ""path""."
"Classical sharia deals with many aspects of public and private life, including religious rituals, family life, business, crimes, and warfare. In former times, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists, who based their legal opinions on Qur'an, Hadith and centuries of debate, interpretation and precedent. Some parts of sharia can be described as ""law"" in the usual sense of that word, while other parts are better understood as rules for living life in accordance with God's will."
Modern countries in the Muslim world all have their own laws. In most of them only a small part of the legal system is based on classical sharia. Muslims disagree on how sharia should be applied in the modern world.
Meaning and origins.
"People of different religions who speak Arabic use the word ""sharīʿah"" to describe a religious tradition that comes from teachings of prophets. Christians and Jews in the Middle East have used it to describe their own religion. For many Muslims the word ""sharia"" means simply ""justice"". They will say that any law agrees with sharia as long as it helps to build a more fair and prosperous society."
"Most Muslims think that sharia should be interpreted by experts in Islamic law. In Arabic, the word ""sharīʿah"" refers to God's revelation, which does not change. In contrast, the rules of behavior created by scholars as they try to understand God's revelation are called ""fiqh"". These rules can change and Islamic scholars have often disagreed about them."

Article Five of the United States Constitution
Article Five of the United States Constitution outlines how the Constitution can be changed. Changes to the Constitution are called Constitutional amendments.
"Article Five also says that there are certain clauses, or parts, of Article One of the Constitution that could not be amended right away. These clauses are explained in the ""Protected clauses"" section."
Background.
"Before the Constitution was approved, the United States was covered by its first constitution, the Articles of Confederation."
"Under the Articles of Confederation, amendments had to be approved by a unanimous vote in all 13 state legislatures. Not only did every state legislature have to agree on the amendment. If a single state Senator or Representative in the country disagreed with an amendment, the amendment would fail. This made it basically impossible to get any amendments passed."
"When the Founding Fathers wrote Article Five, they were trying to make sure changing the Constitution was not too hard, but not too easy either. James Madison later explained that the amendment process in the Constitution ""guards equally against that extreme facility which would render the Constitution too mutable; and that extreme difficulty which might perpetuate its discovered faults."""
"In Simple English, Madison meant that the amendment process protects equally against:"
Step 1: Proposing an amendment.
There are two steps in the process for changing the Constitution. The first step is proposing (formally suggesting) an amendment. Article Five of the Constitution allows this to be done in two different ways.
"The first way is the most common way. Any member of Congress can suggest an amendment. However, two-thirds (67%) of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives have to agree that the amendment is needed. If this happens, the proposed amendment moves to Step 2 in the process."
"As of 2020, the second way has never been used. However, it exists to protect the rights of the state legislatures. If two-thirds of the state legislatures ask them to, Congress has to call a Constitutional Convention. Delegates would come to the Convention from each state. The Constitutional Convention could propose as many amendments as they wanted to. All of the amendments they proposed would move to Step 2 in the process."
"At first, when the Founding Fathers were writing the Constitution, they were only going to give Congress the power to propose amendments. However, some of the Founders, like Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, worried that this gave Congress too much power. Madison and Hamilton re-wrote Article Five to add the second option for proposing an amendment, and the rest of the Founders agreed. Adding the second option helped make sure the states had power too the power to propose amendments if enough of their legislatures agreed."
Step 2: Ratifying the amendment.
"Step 2 starts when an amendment has been proposed, either by Congress or by a Constitutional Convention. The proposed amendment now has to be ratified. Like with Step 1, Article Five gives two choices for how an amendment can be ratified. Congress gets to choose which way to use."
"Congress has almost always chosen the first way: letting the state legislatures ratify the amendment. If three-fourths (75%) of the state legislatures ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"The second option is for Congress to ask each state to create a ""ratifying convention."" This is a group of people not members of the state legislature who would decide whether or not to ratify the amendment. If ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states ratify the amendment, it becomes part of the Constitution."
"Congress has only used the second option once: after it proposed the 21st Amendment. (This amendment cancelled the 18th Amendment, which made alcohol illegal in the United States. The 21st Amendment made alcohol legal again.)"
"At the time, Congress thought that this would be the more democratic option. A large majority of the people in the United States wanted the 21st Amendment to pass. However, Congress thought the state legislators would refuse to pass the amendment because of pressure from powerful groups that were against alcohol. In other words, Congress did not think that the state legislatures would vote the way the people of the United States would want. This example shows why the Founding Fathers included the ""ratifying convention"" option in the amendment process. If the state legislatures get too powerful, or do not represent what the people who elected them want, the people have the power to pass amendments too."
People have different ideas about the Bible. Christians believe it is God's Word to people. The Jews believe that only the Old Testament is from God. Protestants and Catholics believe that the Old and New Testaments are God's Word. Catholics also believe that the books called Apocrypha or Deuterocanonical are part of the Bible. Sometimes different denominations disagree over exactly what the Bible means.
"According to Islam, the Injil itself is to be followed but it is believed to have been corrupted with time. The Qur'an is believed to be the successor."
"Atheists do not believe that gods exist, so the Bible is only an ancient book."
"Deists believe in God, but they believe that the Bible was written by people, so they don't see it as important."
Bavaria
"Bavaria (; , ), officially the Free State of Bavaria (, ; ), is a State (""Bundesland"") of Germany. The territory of this state is the largest of the 16 German states. The state capital is Munich with 1.3 million people. About 12.5 million people live in Bavaria."
"Like many German states, Bavaria was once independent. Ludwig II of Bavaria was its last independent king. Bavaria joined the German Empire in 1871."
Structure.
"Bavaria has seven parts: ""Oberbayern"" (Upper Bavaria), ""Niederbayern"" (Lower Bavaria), ""Schwaben"" (Swabia), ""Mittelfranken"" (Middle Franconia), ""Unterfranken"" (Lower Franconia), ""Oberfranken"" (Upper Franconia) and ""Oberpfalz"" (Upper Palatinate). Bavaria has 71 districts and 25 free cities."
"The highest point is the Zugspitze, which is also the highest mountain in Germany. Munich is the largest city, the second biggest city is Nuremberg (""Nürnberg""), which is famous for its gingerbread, a kind of Christmas bread that is often shaped like a Christmas tree, a snowman or Santa Claus."
Pope Benedict XVI was born in Bavaria.
Administrative divisions.
Administrative regions.
"Bavaria is divided into seven administrative regions called ' (singular '). For every Administrative region there is a state agency called """" (district government)."
"Districts ""(Bezirke)""."
Controllers.
"The prototypes used to design the controller's electrical systems used a so-called ""yoke and gimbal"" taken from a radio control system used to fly model airplanes. This simple design gave very nice control and was highly reliable. The actual controllers sold with the game were quite different and a great disappointment to the development teams. The design of the analog joystick, which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to center the stick, caused many joysticks to have no ability to center. Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not provide smooth control through the travel of the stick. This made controlling games awkward. The controllers did, however, include a pause button. This was a novelty at the time, but would become standard on almost all future game systems. Replacement joysticks were also released by other manufacturers."
"Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line Trak-Ball controller for the system, which was used for titles such as ""Centipede"" or ""Defender"". A paddle controller and an updated self-centering version of the original controller were also being worked on, but never made it to market."
"In the web-video-game review show, James Rolfe's ""The Angry Video Game Nerd"", Rolfe's character is shown as being very frustrated with trying to use the controllers and Pro-Line Trak Ball as neither of them work properly. Other instances of web game review shows disliking the controller are on shows such as Mark Bussler's ""Classic Game Room"", where the host is shown stating that the Atari 5200 controllers are the worst game console controllers of all time."
The controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by IGN editor Craig Harris.
Inside differences between the 5200 and the 400/800.
"Although the Atari 5200's insides were very much like that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were enough so that games designed for one would not run directly on the other."
"One of the most obvious differences was the 5200's lack of a keyboard. However, there were several others:"
"Atari Corp.'s later XE Games System revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a keyboard which could be removed, it was able to run most of the home computer titles directly."
Market failure.
"The Atari 5200 could not run software for the still-popular Atari 2600. An adapter was later released in 1983 allowing it to play all Atari 2600 games, using the more reliable controllers from the 2600."
Another problem was the lack of attention that Atari Inc. gave to the console; most of its attention went to the older Atari 2600. It faced an uphill battle competing with the ColecoVision's head start and a video game market which was beginning to fade.
"At one point, Atari Inc. planned on developing a smaller, less expensive version of the Atari 5200 which would have gotten rid of the controller storage bin. Code-named the ""Atari 5100"" (a.k.a. ""Atari 5200 Jr.""), only a few fully-working prototype Atari 5100s were made before the project was canceled."
"On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the Atari 7800 was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued. Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1 million units."
Technical design.
"""Note: These descriptions are very technical. They are meant to be understood by people with lots of computer experience."""
"Because of these differences, a certain piece of work may be under copyright in one country, and in the public domain in another."
Problems with copyright.
Creativity.
"Some people argue that copyright laws make it easier for people to make new works and think of new ideas. After all, if authors get to make money for the time, effort and money they put in, then they will want to make more works later, and make more money."
"But others believe that copyright laws make it harder to be creative. Without copyright, other people could reuse existing work, and copyright law often stops that."
Publisher control.
"If an author wants to sell a work, it's often easiest to give the copyright to a publisher. The publisher will do all the selling, and in return for that service, will keep part of the money. But the publisher has many different things to sell, and they may not want to sell the work the author made. Authors often find it very hard to find a publisher willing to sell their work."
"But without a publisher, it can be even harder for an author to sell his or her work. In many markets, a few big publishers own the copyrights to almost everything available, and stores will not want to sell works published by small authors themselves. Many people say copyright law helps big publishers stay in control, and keeps smaller authors out of the market. (tragedy of the anticommons)."
Open content.
"As a solution to these problems, groups of authors have come up with the idea of open content. With open content, authors give everyone permission to copy, change and give away or sell their works, as long as they follow certain rules. These rules are explained in an open content license. Some possible open content rules are:"
The term for Open Content is sometimes called Copyleft.
Republic of China
"The Republic of China (), was a country in East Asia that governed all of China before. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is located to the northwest; Japan is to the northeast; the Philippines is to the south. The Chinese Nationalists lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communists in 1949 and moved the government of the Republic of China from Nanjing to Taipei. Constitutionally, it still claims the ownership of all of China, including Mainland China, Hainan and several off-shore islands, Taiwan, Mongolia, northern Myanmar (Burma), and Tuva (now Russian territory), as part of the ROC, however this is rarely noted in recent years."
Territory.
"The territory the Republic of China (ROC) controls is known by most people as the island of Taiwan. Most places on Taiwan Island are called ""Taiwan Province"" by the government of the Republic of China for official business, except the two largest cities of Taipei and Kaohsiung. West of Taiwan Island, there are three small groups of islands that also belong to ROC. They are:"
"The ROC used to govern Mainland China too, from 1911 - 1949, and was a founding member of the UN (as China) in 1945. Today, Mainland China is governed by the Communist People's Republic of China; see History and Political problems of China. However, ROC still declares Mainland China as its territory officially. The Republic of China also used to govern Mongolia."
Administrative divisions.
There are administrative divisions in different levels and types.
"157 Districts (區 qū ㄑㄩ), 17 Country-controlled cities (縣轄市 xiànxiáshì ㄒㄧㄢˋㄒㄧㄚˊㄕˋ), 41 Urban Townships (鎮 zhèn ㄓㄣˋ), and 153 Rural Townships (鄉 xiāng ㄒㄧㄤ) stand the 3rd level. Districts stand under either Special municipalities or Provincial cities; Country-controlled cities, Urban Townships, and Rural Townships stand under Counties."
"Villages (里 lǐ ㄌㄧˇ or 村 cūn ㄘㄨㄣ) stand the 4th level, and Neighborhoods (鄰 lín ㄌㄧㄣˊ) stand the 5th level."
History.
"The Nationalists, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, got rid of the Qing Dynasty ruled by the Manchus, then they established the ROC and ended Imperial Dynastic Rule in late-1911. The ROC at that time had Mainland China and all of what is now called Mongolia."
"After the Japanese were defeated by the Allies during World War II, Taiwan was controlled by the ROC."
"In 1949, the Chinese Communists fought a war against the Nationalists and won. They established the People's Republic of China. The Nationalists left mainland China and arrived in Taiwan."
Politics.
"After the ROC created a base on Taiwan, it hoped one day to capture the Mainland. But Chinese Communists grew stronger, so the Nationalists never did go back. The Communists say they replaced the ROC as the only government of China and also calls Taiwan their own."
"Polls show a majority of people in Taiwan want to never be a part of the People's Republic of China. Some of these people believe in complete Taiwan independence and want to rename the ROC (Taiwan) to ""Republic of Taiwan"" so Taiwan can participate in international affairs. Most others want the ""status quo"", which means keeping everything the way it is now. A small minority wish to someday unite with the People's Republic of China; they want Chinese reunification."
Language.
"Most Taiwanese people speak the Standard Chinese language known as Mandarin, and others speak local dialects such as Min Nan (Taiwanese) or Hakka. The Cantonese language, spoken in parts of southern China (for example, the province of Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macau), is not spoken in Taiwan. A small percentage of Aboriginal Taiwanese speak aboriginal languages, but the rest of the Chinese people have treated them badly, and many of these people, and their languages, struggle to survive. Some older Taiwanese people who went to school while the country was under Japanese rule can speak Japanese."
"After the Nationalist government fled the Mainland in 1949, they brought Mandarin and promoted it in Taiwan. Then everyone in the ROC had to learn Mandarin. But, unlike the people in Mainland China, the Taiwanese never changed to simplified Chinese characters and so they have always used traditional Chinese characters. In the past, students were not allowed to speak their mother tongue in school and were expected to speak only Mandarin. Taiwanese, Hakka, and native languages were considered bad until the early 1990s, when education in these languages began to be taught in some school systems. They were promoted, but by this time, many young people could speak only Mandarin."
"Currently, nearly one third of Taiwanese report knowing some amount of English. Full English fluency is not common, however. The government plans to expand English education and make it an official language by 2030."
The humoral immune system is a part of the immune system which defends the body against invading organisms and other foreign material.
"The humeral part is done by macromolecules outside the cells. These may be secreted antibodies, complement proteins, or certain antimicrobial peptides. Their job is to attack bacteria (and other foreign substances) which are loose in the blood stream or other fluids. In older medicine, these fluids were called ""humors"". Both the more primitive innate immune system, and the later acquired or adaptive immune system of vertebrates, have humoral components."
"The humoral immune system contrasts with the cell-mediated immunity. That involves the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen."
How the humoral system works.
"The main cells that make it work are the B cells, which create and secrete antibodies that seek out the invaders and attach to them. Once the invader is coated in antibodies, this targets the invader for destruction by other parts of the immune system. Before the B cell can create antibodies, it first needs T helper cells to 'teach' the B cell about details of the incoming invader. This is a key part of the adaptive immune system, and the reference attached here summarizes the process."
"The production of antibodies tailor-made to combat particular bacteria is the most important element, but there are a number of other humeral defenses from the more primitive innate immune system."
Andrew Shaw
"Andrew Shaw (born July 20, 1991 in Belleville, Ontario) is a Canadian professional ice hockey player that played for the Chicago Blackhawks and Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL)."
He began his hockey career with the Niagara IceDogs of the OHL and played for them for 2 seasons. He also played for the Owen Sound Attack for 1 season. He entered the draft on 2011 and he was drafted with the 139th overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.
"He was assigned to the Rockford IceHogs, the farm team of the Blackhawks. He was called up to the Blackhawks during the 2011-12 NHL season. On January 5, 2012, he got in his first-ever NHL fight on the second shift of his first NHL game. He returned to the game after receiving stitches and score the first goal of his NHL career on his first shot of his first game against Ilya Bryzgalov of the Philadelphia Flyers. On June 24, 2013, He won the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks after they defeated the Boston Bruins 4 games to 2 in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals."
Allison Crowe
"Allison Crowe (November 16, 1981, British Columbia) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, guitarist and pianist. Most of the songs she records are written by Crowe. She is known as well for releasing cover versions of certain songs. She is known for releasing independent albums. Cover songs include the Beatles' ""Let it Be"" and ""Imagine"" from John Lennon. Her distinctive voice is often compared against that of Mahalia Jackson. She appeared in a cameo role in the 2013 movie ""Man of Steel""."
Moore's law
"Moore's law is that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles about every two years. Intel executive David House said the period was ""18 months"". He predicted that period for a doubling in chip performance: a combination of the effect of more transistors and their being faster."
"The law is named after Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who described the trend in his 1965 paper."
"The paper stated that the number of components in integrated circuits had doubled every year from the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958 until 1965 and predicted that the trend would continue ""for at least ten years"". His prediction has proved very accurate. The law is used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development."
"The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras. All of these are improving at (roughly) exponential rates as well."
This exponential improvement has greatly increased the effect of digital electronics in the world economy. Moore's law describes a driving force of technological and social change in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.
"This trend has continued for more than half a century. Intel stated in 2015 that the pace of advancement has slowed. Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, announced that ""our cadence today is closer to two and a half years than two""."

Early career.
Baltic states
"The Baltic states are three countries in Northern Europe to the east of the Baltic Sea and the south of the Gulf of Finland. They are, from north to south, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The languages that are spoken in these countries are different: while Lithuanians and Latvians speak Baltic languages (Latvian and Lithuanian), Estonians speak an Uralic language (Estonian)."
"By their culture and history, the Baltic countries are close to the Nordic countries. The biggest difference in the history was that the Baltic countries incorporated to the Soviet Union in 1940 (during the Second World War), but not the Nordic countries (with the exception of Karelia, a part of Finland which later joined the Russian SFSR). The three countries would become republics of the Soviet Union as the Estonian SSR, Latvian SSR, and Lithuanian SSR."
"All three Baltic states had their freedom back in 1991, when the Soviet Union came to an end. However, the states all consider the Soviet occupation to be illegal, which has been supported by the United States, European Union, and United Nations. Today, the Baltic countries are some of the richest and most advanced countries which were part of the Soviet Union. They became members of the European Union and NATO in 2004, joined the Schengen Area in 2007, and became part of the eurozone by 2015."
Paganism was the religion of Baltic people before most of them took Christianity during the Middle Ages. Baltic paganism never died out and some people are still pagans.
Topography
"Topography means ""the description of shape"". The word comes from Greek: ' ""place"" and ' ""(I) write"". It is an important part of earth science."
"When you talk of the topography of the land, you refer to the landscape features like valleys, hills and mountains, rivers and lakes, or the coastline. Everything that describes the form of the landscape, is part of the topography. Topographic maps show topography."
Bornholm
"Bornholm is a small, rocky island in the Baltic Sea. Bornholm is a Danish island."
"The island is a popular holiday resort for Scandinavians, Germans and Poles. Many yachters come here in the summer."
"At the end of World War II, the island was ""liberated"" by the Soviet red army, and held for several months after the German surrender. The island lies far east of the demarcation line between the allied forces in Europe. For some time the Soviet presence looked like an occupation. It was not until April 5th, 1946 that the island at last was free."
But then the Danish government took over and the island is today a Danish colony. But the struggle for a free island still goes on as it can be seen on this page Free Bornholm
Budapest
"Budapest is the capital and largest city of Hungary. It was made as such in 1873. In that year three towns on the River Danube, namely ""Buda"", ""Óbuda (Old Buda)"" and ""Pest"" were united. About 1.7 million people live in the city. Its highest place is ""János Hill (527 m.)"""
Climate.
Budapest has a humid subtropical climate with relatively cold winters and quite warm summers.
History.
Celtic tribes lived there before 1 AD. Later Roman empire transformed the first settlements into the Roman town of Aquincum. The Hungarians arrived in the territory of modern Hungary only in the end of 9th century AD.
"Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a great power that dissolved in 1918 after World War I. The city was the focal point of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the Battle of Budapest in 1945, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956."
Landmarks.
"Budapest has historical buildings, baths and parks."
"The Roman Catholic cathedral, the St. Stephen's Basilica is in the 5th district of Budapest. The church is a Neo-Renaissance-style cathedral. It is one of the most significant church buildings in Hungary. The building is named in honor of the Hungarian founding king, St. Stephen (975-1038), whose right hand, the Holy Right, is kept here as a relic. With a height of 96 meters, it is the fourth-tallest building in the country and the third tallest in the capital after the Parliament and the MOL Campus."
"The former royal palace, the Buda Castle -as part of the Castle District- has been part of Budapest's World Heritage Sites since 1987. The Gothic-style royal palace was built in the 1300s and lasted until the end of the 1400s. Due to the Turkish occupation from 1541 to 1686, very serious damage was done to both the castle and the buildings of the Castle District. In the building of the palace, the National Széchényi Library has been located in the back, decorated with Art Nouveau elements, and the Hungarian National Gallery and the Budapest History Museum are located in the palace."
"Also on the Castle Hill, the Matthias Church is a Gothic church with a great historical past. It was originally built in Romanesque style in 1015, but was destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1241. The current building was built in the 14th century and underwent a thorough reconstruction in the late 19th century. After the occupation of Buda, the church was transformed into a mosque, during which the late Gothic frescoes inside the church were destroyed. After the liberation of Buda, according to the plans of Frigyes Schulek, it was restored to its second, Gothic state. During the Second World War, it was used as a camp by the Germans and the Soviets during the siege of Budapest."
"The Hungarian Parliament Building, also known as the Parliament of Budapest after its location, is the seat of the National Assembly of Hungary, a notable landmark of Hungary, and a popular tourist destination in Budapest. It is situated on the Kossuth Lajos Square in the Pest side of the city, on the eastern bank of the Danube. It was designed by Hungarian architect Imre Steindl in neo-Gothic style and opened in 1902. It has been the largest building in Hungary since its completion, and the third biggest Parliament building in the world."
"Further north, the building of the National Police Headquarters (in the common language “Police-Palace”) located in the Árpád Göncz City Center. Since its completion, its shape and size have been one of the defining buildings of the whole of Budapest in terms of cityscape. The plans were completed in the 1990s by József Finta and Géza Meichl, and their construction was financed by Postabank collaborating with the Hungarian police. 36,000 cubic meters of concrete and 4.5 thousand tons of rebar were used for the construction. The headquarters can be divided into two parts, one eight-story and columnar and the other sixteen stories and cylindrical, with police antennas at the top that extend 93 meters high. In 2007, an unknown person fired at the building with a machine gun."
"On the south, in the 10th district of Budapest, located the transmission tower on Száva Street. With a height of 154 meters, it is the third-tallest structure in Budapest (after the Mount Széchenyi TV mast and the chimney of Óbuda Power Plant). The tower is well visible from the southern Pest region of the capital, but it can be seen in several lookouts of Buda too. It was built in 1987, and it is currently owned by Hungarian Telekom. As a backbone transmitter, it broadcasts digital terrestrial radio (T-DAB +) and digital television channels (DVB-T standard, MinDig TV and mobile phone DVB-H)."
"Other landmarks in Budapest are the Citadel, the Statue of Liberty, the Millenium Monument, the Zoo, the Hungarian National Museum, the Great Market Hall, the Dohány Street Synagogue and the famous thermal baths (Széchenyi, Szent Gellért, Király). Budapest is also known for the ruins of Aquincum, the capital city of the Roman Province of Pannonia."

COVID-19 vaccine
"A COVID-19 vaccine is any of the vaccines used against COVID-19 (a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). In July 2020, more than 150 vaccines were being developed in different laboratories. Two mRNA vaccines, one by Pfizer and one by Moderna, were approved late in 2020. Both are over 90% effective. A few vaccines also went into use in early 2021."
"Several countries planned to give the vaccine to many people, but their plans were different. The United Kingdom used its National Health Service. Canada used its military. The United States sent vaccines to all fifty states and the state governments each made their own system."
"The United Kingdom approved the Pfizer vaccine before the European Union or United States did. They began giving it to people on December 8, 2020. The United States began giving people the vaccine on December 14, starting with health care workers in New York City. By April 2021, several vaccines were in use around the world and hundreds of millions of people had been vaccinated."
Covid vaccination started for children aged 12-14 in India on 16 March 2022
Background.
"In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative virus, to become available in less than 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)which is organizing a billion worldwide fund for fast investment and creation of vaccine candidatesindicated in April that a vaccine may be available under emergency use protocols in less than 12 months or by early 2021. On 4May 2020, the WHO organized a telethon (fundraising event broadcasted via televisions) to raise billion from forty countries to support rapid development of vaccines to prevent COVID-19 infections and deaths. The United States government started Operation Warp Speed to develop a vaccine by January 2021."
PittCoVacc.
"PittCoVacc is a vaccine invented by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania in the United States. It was invented to protect people from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It was the first vaccine candidate, meaning vaccine that scientists thought would work well, published in a peer-reviewed study, meaning a scientific paper that other vaccine experts had read and approved before it was printed for people to read."
"As of April 2020, it has been tested in mice but not in human beings."
"PittCoVacc is short for ""Pittsburgh coronavirus vaccine""."
Making PittCoVacc.
"One of the head scientists, Dr. Andrea Gambotto, said they made the vaccine so quickly because they had worked on other coronaviruses before: ""We had previous experience on SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2014. These two viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, teach us that a particular protein, called a spike protein, is important for inducing immunity against the virus. We knew exactly where to fight this new virus. That's why it's important to fund vaccine research. You never know where the next pandemic will come from."""
"The researchers used laboratory equipment to make pieces of the same proteins that are in SARS-CoV-2. They put the proteins inside the bodies of laboratory mice using a microneedle array, meaning a small patch with about 400 tiny needles made out of other protein and sugar. One of the scientists, Dr. Emrullah Korkmaz, said these needles melt away inside the skin after they release the vaccine. The skin is a good place to put a vaccine because it has many immune cells in it. Then the mice made antibodies, or protective molecules, in their blood. The scientists measured the amount of antibodies and guessed it would be enough to fight off the SARS-CoV-2 virus if the mice were exposed to it. It took about two weeks for the mice to make lots of antibodies."
The scientists said it would be easy to make large amounts of vaccine and large numbers of microneedle arrays to use on people.
APN01.
"Another team of scientists led by Dr. Josef Penninger of the University of British Columbia invented a medicine called APN01. They tested APN01 in engineered human tissue. These are human cells put together to act like part of the body, but they are not a whole animal or person. They added a protein called ""human recombinant soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2"" (hrsACE2) and saw that it stopped the virus from taking over cells. They named their hrsACE2 APN01."
Messenger RNA vaccines.
"Other scientists have developed vaccines that use messenger RNA to teach the body to recognize the virus. They say mRNA vaccines take less time to develop and make, than protein or whole-virus vaccines."
Messenger RNA vaccines need to be stored at very cold temperatures. Ordinary refrigerators are not cold enough.
Moderna vaccine.
"In mid-May 2020, a company called Moderna said they tested their mRNA vaccine in forty-five people and eight of them produced antibodiesbut they did not publish the specific data or publish an article in a scientific journal. Anna Durbin of Johns Hopkins University said it was too soon to tell if people would keep the antibodies long enough for the vaccine to work. The United States Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna permission to test the vaccine again in more people. Moderna's chief medical officer said the vaccine could be ready in January 2021."
"The Moderna vaccine entered stage-three clinical trials on June 27, 2020. That means it is being tested on humans. Dr. Anthony Fauci said he did not think the vaccine would be dangerous."
"On November 16, Moderna said its vaccine was 94.5% effective. The vaccine has to kept colder than freezing but it does not have to be kept as cold as the Pfizer vaccine. Distribution began in February 2021."
Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
"The German company BioNTech and Pfizer made a deal with the United States government to make 100 million doses of mRNA vaccine by December 2020. The vaccine completed phase I trials and started its next trial on July 27, 2020. Instead of being a phase II trial or a phase III trial, Pfizer's team was trying to do both phases at once. If the companies could make the vaccine on time, the U.S. government would give them almost US$2 billion. The vaccine is called BNT162b2. BioNTech paid its employees overtime to do extra work. They called this ""Project Lightspeed"" because they wanted to develop the vaccine quickly."
Rise to power.
"Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers as of 6 BC, but soon went into retirement in Rhodes. He was reported as wanting no further role in politics.p117p46 After the early deaths of Augustus' young grandchildren-turned-sons, Lucius and Gaius in AD 2 and 4 respectively, and the earlier death of his own brother Drusus (9 BC), Tiberius was recalled to Rome in June AD 4, where he was adopted by Augustus on the condition that he, in turn, adopt his nephew Germanicus.p119 This continued the tradition of presenting at least two generations of heirs."
"In the same year, Tiberius was also granted the powers of a tribune and proconsul, emissaries from foreign kings had to pay their respects to him, and by 13 was awarded with his second triumph and equal level of ""imperium"" with that of Augustus.p119/120 Tiberius duly assumed the titles of Augustus when the old man's long reign came to an end in AD 14."
Tiberius Emperor.
"Problems soon arose. The northern legions had not been paid, and rebelled. Germanicus and Tiberius's son, Drusus, were dispatched with a small force to quell the uprising and bring the legions back in line. Germanicus rallied the mutineers and led them on a short campaign across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus. Germanicus's forces smashed across the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. So Germanicus dealt a significant blow to Rome's enemies, and quelled an uprising of troops, actions that increased his fame with the Roman people."
"After being recalled from Germania, Germanicus celebrated a triumph in Rome in AD 17, the first full triumph that the city had seen since Augustus's own in 29 BC. As a result, in AD 18 Germanicus was granted control over the eastern part of the empire, just as both Agrippa and Tiberius had received before, and was clearly the successor to Tiberius. But tragedy struck once again, as Germanicus died after a year, apparently poisoned."
Tiberius and Sejanus.
"Sejanus had served the imperial family for almost twenty years when he became Praetorian Prefect in AD 15. The death of Drusus elevated Sejanus. Tiberius had statues of Sejanus erected throughout the city, and Sejanus became more and more visible as Tiberius began to withdraw from Rome altogether. Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal to Capri in AD 26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome."
Sejanus's position was not quite that of successor. The presence of Livia (the third wife and advisor of Augustus) seems to have checked his power for a time. Her death in AD 29 changed all that. Sejanus began a series of purge trials of Senators in Rome. Germanicus's widow Agrippina the Elder and two of her sons were arrested and exiled in AD 30 and later all died in suspicious circumstances.
"In response, Tiberius manoeuvered cleverly. He knew an immediate condemnation of Sejanus might not succeed. Since he and Sejanus were then joint Consuls, Tiberius resigned his post of Consul, which forced Sejanus to do likewise. This removed much of Sejanus' legal powers and protection. Then, in AD 31, Sejanus was summoned to a meeting of the Senate, where a letter from Tiberius was read condemning Sejanus and ordering his immediate execution. Macro was appointed Praetorian Prefect, with the specific job of removing Sejanus. Sejanus was tried, and he and several of his colleagues were executed within the week."
"More treason trials followed. Tacitus writes that Tiberius had been hesitant to act at the start of his reign, but now, towards the end of his life, he seemed to do so without compunction. However, Tacitus' portrayal of a tyrannical, vengeful emperor has been challenged by several modern historians. The prominent ancient historian Edward Togo Salmon notes in his work, ""A history of the Roman world from 30 B.C. to A.D. 138"":"
Last years.
"The last years of Tiberius were notable for his complete absence from Rome, and his inactivity as Emperor. He was now an old man in his 70s, and left decisions to the officials in Rome. He did nothing to prevent the rise of his grandnephew Caligula, who was now popular with the people (as the only surviving son of germanicus) and who had the support of the Prefect Macro."
"In 35, Tiberius would make both caligula and his own grandson Gemellus joint heirs, before dying two years later, in his 78th year. Some speculate Macro and Caligula hastened the old emperor’s death. Regardless, Caligula would succeed Tiberius as emperor."
14
"14 is a year in the 1st century. It was a common year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Pompeius and Appuleius."
Ray Bradbury
"Ray Douglas Bradbury (August 22, 1920 - June 5, 2012) was an American writer. His most famous works are ""The Martian Chronicles"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"". He also wrote big collections of short stories such as ""Driving Blind."""
"He was born in Waukegan, Illinois to a Swedish mother. He graduated from a high school in Los Angeles, California. Many of his works are based on real life, such as ""Dandelion Wine,"" a book about growing up in small-town Illinois. His other work includes movies, and screenplays. He won many awards. He died in his Los Angeles home."
"He also wrote the short stories ""Dark They Were and Golden Eyed"" and ""A Sound of Thunder."""
Porpoise
"Porpoises are mammals that live in the ocean. They are in the order ""Cetacea"". They form the family Phocoenidae. There are six species of porpoise."
Appearance.
"Porpoises look much like dolphins, but they are different in some ways: They are smaller and more stout. They have spade-shaped teeth, rounded heads, blunt jaws, and triangular dorsal fins."
Cetology
"Cetology is a type of science. It is the study of the cetaceans. It includes whales, dolphins, and porpoises."
"Cetology is the branch of marine mammal science which studies approximately eighty species of whales, dolphins, and porpoise in the scientific order Cetacea. The term was created in the mid-19th century from the Greek cetus (""whale"") and -ology (""study"")."
"Cetologists, or those who study it, seek to understand and explain cetacean evolution, distribution, morphology, behavior, community dynamics, and other topics."
"Later in life (at the presumed age of around 34 according to Bud Sagendorf), Popeye would offer his seafaring services at local ports; it was there he would eventually meet the ever-ambitious Castor Oyl and his sidekick Ham Gravy, who sought Popeye's services in order to travel to the gambling paradise of Dice Island and make it big using the luck-enhancing powers of their mysterious pet, Bernice the Whiffle Hen, and through them he would meet Castor's sister, Olive Oyl who at first was not too fond of the sailor and vice versa. Even her first words to him were harsh: ""Take your hooks offa me or I'll lay ya in a scupper"", and they fought bitterly---and hilariously---for months until finally realizing their feelings for each other. It was at this point that Olive left her womanizing fiancée Ham Gravy to be with the gruff sailor she loved. Since then, Popeye and Olive have remained almost inseparable and happily in love."
Songs.
"Since his debut in animation, Popeye has had many unique songs for himself as well as many tunes dedicated to him."
Popeye in other media.
"The character has been adapted into different forms of media, including animated, live-action movies, TV shows, video games, and action figures."
Astrophysics
"Astrophysics is the study of how stars, planets and other things in the Universe work, and how we can learn about them. Astrophysicists use physics to explain what astronomers find and see."
Astrophysics is also the study of how the Universe started and how it is changing with time. This part of astrophysics is called cosmology.
History.
"For a long time bodies in the sky seemed to be unchanging spheres moving in a circle. But on Earth growth and decay happened, and natural motion was in a straight line. Therefore, people thought the celestial region was made of a fundamentally different kind of matter from that found on Earth."
"During the 16th and 17th century, natural philosophers such as Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton, began to maintain that the celestial and terrestrial regions were made of similar kinds of material and were subject to the same natural laws."
"When they were able to work out how the planets moved, the science of astrophysics was born. Sir Isaac Newton realized that the same rules of mechanics that he had found on the surface of the Earth also could be used to predict how the planets moved. He said, ""As above, so below."" By this, he meant that we can study how things work on this planet to find out how things work in space."
"Later scientists found that by looking at the light from stars, they were able to work out what they were made from. This process is called spectroscopy."
Types of astrophysics.
There are two main types of astrophysics:
Word order
"Word order is part of syntax, which is part of grammar. Word order may be different in different languages. For example, English ""I play tennis only sometimes"" would be in German ""Ich spiele nur manchmal Tennis"", literally ""I play only sometimes tennis"". In Norwegian, the same sentence would be ""Jeg spiller bare tennis noen ganger"" (""I play tennis only sometimes"")."
"In Portuguese, the sentence could be ""Eu só jogo tênis algumas vezes"" (""I only play tennis sometimes), but word order can be changed to ""Eu jogo tênis só algumas vezes"" (""I play tennis only sometimes""). However, ""Eu jogo só tênis algumas vezes"" is not allowed (""I play only tennis sometimes"") because the meaning would be changed."
Subject-verb-object.
"In English, a simple sentence with a verb (an action), subject (who or what is doing the action), and an object (to whom or what the action is done) is written with a subject-verb-object word order (SVO). For example, in the sentence ""Robert opens the door"", ""Robert"" is the subject, ""opens"" is the verb and ""door"" is the object. SVO is the second-most common word order among all languages and is used in 42% of them. Examples are Mandarin Chinese, Bahasa Melayu, Bahasa Indonesia, Spanish, French, Italian, Thai and Vietnamese. While some of the above languages can use other word orders, such as SOV and VSO, they use SVO for the simplest sentences."
"In other languages, sentences can use other word orders. Consider ""Robert opens the door"". In English, changing the word order to ""The door opens Robert"" would change the meaning of the sentence. In Latin, however, ""Robertus ianuam aperit"" and ""ianuam Robertus aperit"" mean the same. ""Ianuam"" is in the accusative case and so it is the direct object and ""Robertus"" the subject. Changing the cases of the words, however, to ""Robertem ianua aperit"" would change the meaning of the sentence: ""ianua"" is now in the nominative case and so it is the subject and ""Robertum"" the object."
Subject-object-verb.
"The subject-object-verb (SOV) word order is the one that is used by the greatest number of distinct languages, 45% of them. It is especially common in the theoretical language family that is known as the Altaic language family, which includes many languages such as Japanese, Korean, Mongolian and the Turkic languages."
"In Japanese, for example, a simple sentence uses SOV. In other words, the sentence ""Robert opens the door"" becomes ""Robert the door opens"". Such languages often use postpositions, which act like prepositions but appear after content words rather than before them, to show the role of a word in the sentence. The sample sentence ""Robert opens the door"" would be in Japanese ロバートはドアを開ける ""Robāto-wa doa-o akeru"" in which は ""wa"" as in ロバートは ""Robāto-wa"" shows that ロバート ""Robāto (Robert)"" is the topic of the sentence, and を ""o"" as in ドアを ""doa-o"" shows that ドア ""doa"" is the direct object of the sentence. Around 45% of all languages are SOV languages."
Verb-subject-object.
"The verb-subject-object (VSO) word order is the third-most common word order in world languages. There are far fewer VSO languages than SVO and SOV languages, and only 9% of them are VSO. Language groups in which VSO is common include Afroasiatic languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew and Aramaic, and Celtic languages, such as Irish, Welsh and Cornish. In VSO languages, ""Robert opens the door"" would be ""Opens Robert the door"". Spanish sentences are usually SVO, but VSO is also common.

Jimmy Carter
"James Earl Carter Jr. (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician and philanthropist. He was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Carter was a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967 and the 76th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975."
"Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy. In 1953, Carter left the military and returned home to Georgia to take charge of the family's peanut-growing business. Carter was against racial segregation and support the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist in the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter was in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia. He was governor until 1975."
"At first, he was not seen as a serious presidential candidate as not many people knew him outside of Georgia. Carter eventually won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and was elected president, beating then-Republican President Gerald Ford."
"On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, he created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He also created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter helped create the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. However, the economy during his presidency was bad as it had stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The end of his presidential term was remembered by the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan."
"In 1980, Carter ran against Senator Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primaries and won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the presidential election to Republican nominee Ronald Reagan in a landslide. Polls of historians and political scientists usually see Carter as an average president; becoming more popular for his humanitarian work after leaving office."
"In 1982, Carter created the Carter Center to focus on human rights across the world. He has traveled to support peace talks, look over elections, and support ending deadly diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter is seen as an important person in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He has written over 30 books from memoirs to poetry. Carter is the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95."
Early life.
"Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at Lillian Carter Health and Rehabilitation in Plains, Georgia. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital. He was the oldest son of Bessie Lillian () and James Earl Carter Sr. He is distantly related to President Richard Nixon and Bill Gates. The family moved several times when Carter was an infant. The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery."
Carter attended the Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. He also joined the Future Farmers of America and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.
"After high school, Carter went to Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus, Georgia. He took extra mathematics courses at Georgia Tech."
"In 1943, Carter was accepted to the United States Naval Academy. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith. The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946. He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen. Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and became an ensign."
"From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his time in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets. In 1948, he began officers' training for being in a submarine. He was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949."
"In 1952, Carter began his work with the US Navy's nuclear submarine program. He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C. for three month. During this time, Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York."
"In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school at Union College in Schenectady. Carter's father died and he was released from active duty to allow him to take over the family peanut business. Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953."
"He was not active at the Navy Reserve until 1961, and left the service as a lieutenant. His awards included the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal."
Farming life.
"Carter's father, James died after having recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains. Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office. Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business. His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going. He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business. Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful."
"Georgia State Senator, 1963–1967."
"Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country. By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board. At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools."
"In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate. At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County. Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won."
"Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused. Carter did not say anything about this at first. He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution. When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it ""the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died""."
"Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission."
"When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election. The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college. Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus."
"Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term. For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term. Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program. The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives."
1966 and 1970 campaigns for governor.
"Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway. However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia. Callaway became a Republican in 1964. Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway. In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox."
Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970. Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.
Quiz
"A quiz is a type of game in which players (as individuals or in teams) try to answer questions correctly. Quizzes are also used in education and similar fields to improve the growth of someone's knowledge, abilities, and/or skills."
Quizzes are usually scored in points. Many quizzes are designed for people to determine the winner of a group of participants - usually the participant with the highest score.
John Hancock
"John Hancock (January 12, 1737 – October 8, 1793) was an early American patriot, a leader in the American Revolutionary War, and an American statesman. He was the first man to sign America's Declaration of Independence. In modern America, ""John Hancock"" is a synonym for signature."
"Hancock's ancestors arrived in the English colonies in 1652. In 1737, Hancock was born in Braintree (now Quincy, Massachusetts). When John Hancock Jr. his father died, he was adopted by his uncle, a merchant in Boston, Massachusetts. At his uncle's death in 1754, Hancock inherited the business. He became a leading merchant in Boston and one of the richest in the colonies."
"In 1768, British officials seized his ship, the ""Liberty"". It carried a shipment of wine. The officials said he was smuggling. Boston patriots rioted and he was acquitted. This incident was one of the events that led to the American Revolutionary War."
Hancock had several important jobs in Colonial America and the early United States of America. He was president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in 1774 and 1775. He used his money to support American independence. The British thought him a very dangerous man.
"Hancock was president of the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1775. He wanted to lead the Continental Army. George Washington got the job instead. With 5,000 troops, he tried to free Rhode Island from the British. He was not successful."
Hancock led the convention that adopted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780. He was first Governor of the state Massachusetts. He served nine terms. Hancock suffered from gout in his later life. He died in 1793.
Huldrych Zwingli
"Huldrych (or Ulrich) Zwingli or Ulricus Zuinglius (January 1, 1484 – October 11, 1531) was the leader of the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland, and founder of the Swiss Reformed churches. Separately from Martin Luther, Zwingli arrived with similar final beliefs. He did this by studying the Bible from the point of view of a humanist scholar. Zwingli's father was named Ulrich Zwingli also and his mother was named Margaret Meili. Zwingli had 2 sisters and 7 brothers."
"Zwingli was born in Toggenburg, Wildhaus, St. Gallen, Switzerland, to an important family of the middle class."
Zwingli's Reformation was supported by the judge and people of Zürich. It led to major changes in the lives of the people and state matters in Zürich.
"Zwingli was killed at Kappel am Albis, in a battle against the Roman Catholic Cantons of Switzerland."
20th-century classical music
"20th-century classical music is classical music written during the last century. During earlier periods of music history composers from different countries wrote in styles which were often quite similar. For example, composers in the Classical music period (about 1740-1820) had fairly similar ideas about what forms to use (e.g. sonata form), what instruments should be used in orchestras or how to write good tunes."
"Classical music from the 20th century is extremely varied. There are lots of different “schools” (meaning: ways of thinking) as lots of composers had their own ideas about how to compose in ways that were different from what had been done before. A lot of these genres (types of music) had names ending in “ism”: there was serialism, Expressionism, Neoclassicism, Impressionism as well as jazz, world music (music from non-European cultures) and folksong and, later on electronic music and then Minimalism and even post-modernism."
"The names of periods in history were usually given to them many years afterwards. For example, the term Middle Ages was not used until long after the Middle Ages had finished. It is difficult to know what to call the period we live in now. In music people often talk about “Modern Music” meaning any music written after 1900. We also talk about “Contemporary Music” meaning more or less the same thing (“contemporary” means “things that are happening in our time”, i.e. “living composers”). Now that the 21st century has started some musicians are starting to talk about “20th century music” (1900-2000) and a period called “Contemporary Music” (1975-today)."
This article will discuss classical music written from 1900 to the year 1999.
Reaction to Romanticism.
"Many European composers at the beginning of the 20th century felt that the system of tonality (music in major and minor keys) had been used for so long that it was time to do create a new approach and try something different. Arnold Schoenberg and Igor Stravinsky were two of the most important composers at that time, and they had very different ideas about how to compose music."
"Schoenberg's music became very atonal (not in any key). Eventually he developed what he called twelve tone music. This was atonal music which was organized by putting the notes of a musical idea in a particular order which could be changed in many ways during the piece. This way of organizing music is called “serialism” (a “series” is a “row of things”). Many composers were influenced by Schoenberg, especially Alban Berg and Anton von Webern."
"Stravinsky came from Russia. He was inspired by Russian culture. He wrote some music for a ballet called Rite of Spring. This music was very new. It had very irregular rhythms which the dancers found very difficult to dance to at first. It also used polytonality (being in more than one key at once). Later on Stravinsky was inspired by music from the 18th century. He used it, but made changes to it, adding dissonant notes and strange chords. This is called neoclassicism (“neo” means “new”). Stravinsky's music seemed to many people to be the opposite of serialism, but in his last years Stravinsky started to use serialism as well."
Impressionism.
"In France a movement called Impressionism was popular with painters. Composers were very interested in these paintings. Claude Debussy wrote music which is often called “Impressionistic”. The ideas of clear tonality (being clear about which key the music is in) are often deliberately blurred. He uses interesting chords just for the sound that they make. He used the whole tone scale and pentatonic scale and was inspired by Javanese music. Maurice Ravel’s music is sometimes similar, although he developed his own style. Later French composers include Olivier Messiaen who used a system of new scales which he called Modes of limited transposition. He was also interested in music from around the world, and he also used bird song in his music."
Late Romanticism.
"While all this was happening there were some composers who continued to write in a style which was basically Romantic. Edward Elgar ‘s music is often described as “Edwardian” (from the period of King Edward VII). Other British composers of the time were also inspired by English folkmusic, i.e. Ralph Vaughan Williams, George Butterworth, Roger Quilter and Gerald Finzi. Frederick Delius wrote Romantic music which was also quite Impressionistic. The Russian Sergei Rachmaninoff and the German Richard Strauss continued to write in a Romantic style until their deaths in the 1940s. The Finnish composer Jean Sibelius and the Dane Carl Nielsen wrote great symphonies which were still in a tonal style, and in Italy Puccini was writing operas in a Romantic style, often called “verismo” (“like real life”)."
Symphonic tradition.
Veal
"Veal is the meat of young cattle (calves), as opposed to beef from older cattle. Though veal can be made from a calf of either sex and any breed, most veal comes from male calves of dairy cattle breeds. Veal has a tender texture."
As food.
"Veal has been an important ingredient in Italian and French cuisine since ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include: fried escalopes, fried veal Grenadines (small thick fillet steaks), stuffed paupiettes, roast joints and blanquettes. As veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish consisting of breaded veal cutlets."
Animal welfare.
Veal is a controversial issue in terms of animal welfare.
"Many animal welfare groups, who strongly focus on factory farming, try to educate consumers about several veal production procedures that they consider to be inhumane. This education has been successful in creating pressure on the industry, resulting in recently announced changes in the methods used by the veal industry."
"A strong animal welfare movement about veal started in the 1980s with the release of photographs of veal calves tied up in crates where they could barely move. After people saw these photographs, people started buying less veal. They have not started buying more again."
Many veal farmers listened to the concern of their customers and have started improving conditions in their veal farms.
"The American Veal Association has announced they plan to stop the use of crates by 2017, which is often the main focus of controversy in veal farming. Strauss Brands is the first veal packer in the US to raise veal calves completely tether free and group raised since December 31, 2008."
"Though a lot of people think the crates are bad because the calves can't move much and get sick, the Veal Quality Assurance Program &amp; Veal Issues Management Program industry fact sheet, and the Ontario Veal Association say the crates are important for keeping out diseases and keeping the calves from getting hurt. They also state that it lets veal farmers provide more personal attention to veal calves."
"Other uses for male dairy calves include raising bob veal (slaughter at 2 or 3 days old), raising calves as ""red veal"" without the harsh food restrictions needed to create pale meat (resulting in fewer antibiotic treatments and fewer slaughtered calves), and as dairy beef."
"When it comes to the centuries-old method of free raised veal, calves never experience the stress of confinement, separation from their mothers and herd-mates, or an unnatural diet. Many veal producers are realizing this, and the demand for free raised veal is rapidly increasing."
"In 2007, less than 5% of veal calves were raised in a group environment. In 2009, this had increased to 35%."
Veal crate bans.
"The following shows where veal crates have been banned, or are currently in the process of being banned:"
Europe.
"Veal crates became illegal in the UK in 1990, and a full ban has been placed for the entire European Union, as of 2007. Switzerland, with its substantial dairy industry, continues to use crates."
"Veal calf production as such is not allowed in many Northern European countries, such as in Finland. In Finland it is illegal to give an animal food the caretaker knows is bad for it, and it is also illegal to not give the animal enough food."
USA.
"Crates are slowly being banned in the United States. As stated above, several large veal producers are working on getting rid of veal crates, as well as the American Veal Association."
State-by-state veal crate bans are as follows:
Current active legislation in:
Hyssop
"Hyssop (""Hyssopus"") is a genus of about 1012 species of herbaceous or semi-woody plants in the family Lamiaceae. They are native to the east Mediterranean to central Asia."
"They are aromatic, with upright branched stems up to 60 cm long covered with fine hairs at the tips. The small blue flowers are on the upper part of the branches during summer. By far the best-known species is the herb hyssop (""H. officinalis""). It is widely grown outside its native area in the Mediterranean."
"The anise hyssop, ""Agastache foeniculum"" (also called blue giant hyssop) is a very different plant and not a close relative, although both are in the mint family. Anise hyssop is native to much of north-central and northern North America."
Origin of name.
"The name 'hyssop' can be traced back almost unchanged through the Greek word (""hyssopos"") and Hebrew word (""ezov""). The Book of Exodus in the Bible records that the blood of the sacrifices was applied to the doorposts using hyssop on the night of Passover. Its vomit-inducing properties are also mentioned in the Book of Psalms. In the New Testament, a sponge soaked in sour wine or vinegar was stuck on a branch of hyssop and offered to Jesus of Nazareth on the cross just before he died. Both Matthew and Mark mention this but refer to the plant using the general term (""kalamos""), which is translated as ""reed"" or ""stick."""
Seeds.
"Michelle Ryan was revealed to have been cast as Jekyll's assistant, Katherine Reimer, in August 2006. Ryan believed herself to be too young for the part, though that aspect had already been written into the character. To prepare, she consulted the Royal College of Psychiatry. Ryan dyed her hair red for the role to help differentiate her from Tom Jackman's wife. Denis Lawson was cast as Peter Syme. The actor consulted his post-graduate son for information on Syme's job."
"Moffat initially doubted Gina Bellman's suitability for the role of Claire Jackman because he associated her too much with Jane Christie, the character she had played in his sitcom ""Coupling"". Moffat did not imagine the character to be as beautiful as Bellman, but her audition was so good that he revised his vision of the character. Bellman originally auditioned for the role of Katherine, but the producers wanted someone younger to play that role. However, Bellman said that she talked herself out of the role by arguing that there should be an age gap between Katherine and Claire to avoid Katherine becoming a threat to the wife. Bellman approached her role as if Claire had become caught up in Tom's mid-life crisis, an angle that impressed the producers."
"Meera Syal was attracted to her role because Miranda was not a clichéd private detective and she thought the humour was ""fresh"". During the second filming block, Mark Gatiss briefly joined the cast, playing the small but important role of Robert Louis Stevenson in flashback scenes in episode five."
"Other roles included Paterson Joseph as Benjamin Maddox, Linda Marlowe as Ms Utterson and Al Hunter Ashton as Christopher."
Production.
"The series was filmed in two blocks of three episodes. The first three were directed by Douglas Mackinnon and the second three episodes by Matt Lipsey. It took an hour of make-up each day to turn Nesbitt into Hyde; a hairpiece lowered his hairline and prosthetics were added to his chin, nose and ear lobes. He also wore black contact lenses to make Hyde ""soulless"". The producers decided that Hyde's imminent arrival would be indicated by the flash of a black eye. The eye imagery evolved during filming, and did not appear in the script."
"Filming began in September 2006 with the zoo sequence from the second episode. Benjamin's team have set Tom up to force out Hyde by placing his son, Eddie, in the lion's den. Writing the sequence at a late stage in the production, Moffat wanted to compare Hyde's natural instinct to kill to that of a lion. This was shot on location at Heythrop Zoo, a private zoo in Chipping Norton run by Jim Clubb, whose firm Amazing Animals specialises in training animals for cinema and television. The Norman Foster-designed building in Chertsey, Surrey, which then housed the European Headquarters of video game designer and publisher Electronic Arts, was used as The Klein &amp; Utterson Institute. A large country estate near Henley-on-Thames and in Bognor Regis was used for some of the scenes. A disused Boys' school in Gloucestershire, and the Hammer House in Wardour Street, Soho were used in episode six. Filming concluded on 20 December 2006."
"The production team had twelve days to shoot each episode. Director Douglas Mackinnon says this was the biggest challenge of the project. The required amount of material was shot for most of the episodes. However, an extra twenty minutes of material was filmed for episode six. Director Matt Lipsey recalls that the team struggled to cut the extra material whilst maintaining the integrity of the episode. Lipsey credits Moffat for not ""being precious"" over his material during the editing process. His willingness to cut superfluous material meant that he was taken seriously when he argued for something to be retained."
The music was composed by Debbie Wiseman.
Broadcast and reception.
"""Jekyll"" was shown on BBC One on Saturday nights at 9p.m. A two-week break occurred between showings of the third and fourth episodes because the Live Earth benefit concert was broadcast during its timeslot on 7 July."
"The series began on BBC America from 4 August 2007, as part of a ""Supernatural Saturday"" programming strand."
"In Australia, ""Jekyll"" began on ABC1, Sundays at 8.30 p.m. from 2 March 2008. There was a double episode back-to-back each week. In Canada, ""Jekyll"" began on Showcase, at the end of August 2007 and on BBC Canada, Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. from 26 March 2008. In Hong Kong, Wednesday at 11:55 p.m. from 11 February 2009 on TVB Pearl. In the Netherlands, ""Jekyll"" was broadcast in the summer of 2009 on Sci-Fi Channel."
"Certain edits were made to the United Kingdom broadcasts in order to remove language unsuitable for Saturday night BBC One audiences. For example, a line spoken by Hyde in episode one was changed from ""Who the fuck is Mr Hyde?"" to ""Who the hell is Mr Hyde?"""
"James Jackson of ""The Times"" rated the first episode four out of five stars, calling Nesbitt's performance as Hyde ""as entertainingly [over the top] as a dozen ""Doctor Who"" villains, with a palpable sense of menace to boot"". The conspiracy plot is praised as a storyline that separates this series from other adaptations. ""The Daily Telegraph's"" Stephen Pile criticised the script for ""veering between Hammer horror and larky humour"". James Walton called the first episode a combination of ""a good yarn with several nicely thoughtful touches"". David Cornelius of ""DVDTalk"" said ""six episodes, 300 minutes, not a single one of them wasted. 'Jekyll' is this year's finest television event""."
"The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, commenting on the series being part of their 2008 line-up, said ""This classic horror tale has been given a modern make-over that will leave you on the edge of your seat and begging for more. James Nesbitt is outstanding as the new Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde"". Nesbitt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television for his roles. Paterson Joseph received a mention in the nominations for the 2008 Screen Nation awards."
Home release.
"The BBFC rated all episodes as a 15 certificate on 11 June 2007. ""Jekyll: Season One"" was released for region 2 on 30 July 2007 by Contender Home Entertainment. It includes uncut episodes, including restoration of some swearing cut from the BBC broadcasts. As DVD Verdict says about this uncut version, ""the language is saucier, the violence a bit more bloody, and the sex more primal."" The disc contains audio commentaries on two episodes: producer Elaine Cameron, writer Steven Moffat and first-block director Douglas Mackinnon comment on episode one, while executive producer Beryl Vertue, second-block director Matt Lipsey and actress Gina Bellman comment upon the sixth episode. The set also contains two documentaries: ""Anatomy of a Scene"" focuses upon the production of the zoo sequence in episode two, while ""The Tale Retold"" covers the evolution of the series. The first Region 1 release occurred in the United States on 18 September 2007, although the Region 1 Canadian release was delayed until 9 October, following the Canadian broadcast of the series on Showcase, which commenced at the end of August 2007."
American remake.
"In May 2016, Variety reported that Lionsgate will develop an adaptation of the BBC miniseries with Ellen DeGeneres and Jeff Kleeman In July 2016, it was announced that Chris Evans would play the leading role. In December 2016, it was announced that Ruben Fleischer will direct the film."
"Forsyth, Montana"
"Forsyth is a city of Montana in the United States. It is the county seat of Rosebud County. About 1,800 people lived there in 2010."
Forsyth was established in 1876 as the first settlement on the Yellowstone River.
"Libby, Montana"
"Libby is a city of Montana in the United States. It is the county seat of Lincoln County. As of the 2010 census, 2,628 people lived there."
"Libby is in the Kootenai National Forest, between the Cabinet Mountains to the south and the Purcell Mountains to the north. It is along the Kootenai River, and downstream from the Libby Dam. Libby is at an elevation of above sea level."
"Hardin, Montana"
"Hardin is a city of Montana in the United States. It is the county seat of Big Horn County. About 3,500 people lived there in 2010."
The Little Bighorn River joins the Bighorn River near the town. It is north of the Crow Indian Reservation.
"In the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Cold War alliances were broken in an important way for the first time with the Soviet Union and United States favoring one side and Britain and France the other. The Western Allies also decided to let Soviet troops suppress the Hungarian Revolution of 1956."
"US vice-president Richard Nixon engaged in several talks with Khrushchev during the 1950s. One of these was the 1959 ""Kitchen Debate"" in a model kitchen in Moscow. The debates highlighted the political and economic differences between the Americans and the Soviets. The following year, the United States U-2 spy plane crashed in the Soviet Union. Tensions between the two countries increased."
Cuban Missile Crisis (1962).
"After the United States had invaded Cuba and failed in the Bay of Pigs, the Soviet Union attempted to supply Cuba with nuclear missiles. The missiles in Cuba would have allowed the Soviet Union to target almost the entire United States effectively. In response the United States sent a large number of ships to blockade Cuba to prevent the Soviet Union from sharing the weapons. The United States and Soviet Union agreed that the Soviet Union would no longer give nuclear weapons to Cuba if the United States didn't invade Cuba again. That was the highest period of tension during the Cold War and was the closest the world came to a nuclear war, with possible global conflict to follow."
Détente (1962–1981).
"After the agreement that ended the Cuban Missile Crisis, relations between both sides eased up. Several treaties, designed to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, were signed. In 1964, the US under President Lyndon Johnson invaded North Vietnam, which resulted in a humiliating defeat for the Americans and South Vietnam in 1975. During this period of détente, the United States began building a good relationship with the People's Republic of China, which had once been an ally of the Soviet Union."
End.
"The policy of détente ended in 1981, when US President Ronald Reagan ordered a massive military build-up to challenge Soviet influence around the world. The United States began to support anti-communists all over the world with money and weapons. The idea was to help them overthrow their communist governments."
"The Soviets had a slow economy during this decade because military spending was at an all-time high. They tried to keep up with the United States in military spending but could not do so. In the Soviet war in Afghanistan, which started in 1979, the Soviets had a difficult time fighting resistance groups, with some of them armed and trained by the United States. The Soviets' failed invasion of Afghanistan is often compared to the American failure during the Vietnam War."
"In the late 1980s, the new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, made an effort to make an ally of the United States to fix world problems caused by the war, with the ultimate aim of eliminating nuclear weapons. However, that did not take place because Reagan insisted on having a nuclear missile defence system. The people of the Soviet Union were divided. Some wanted Gorbachev to fight harder to eliminate nuclear weapons, but others did not want him to be talking to the United States at all. The mixed feelings created an atmosphere of political infighting, and the people were no longer united behind one goal. Also, the Communist Party started to crumble."
"After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and without communist rule holding together the countries that comprised the Soviet Union, it was divided into smaller countries in 1991 like Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Georgia. Eastern Europe got very poor and broken and returned to capitalism. The Cold War was over."
"Not all historians agree on when the Cold War ended. Some think it ended when the Berlin Wall fell, but others think it ended when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991."
Mainland China
"Mainland China, also called the Chinese Mainland, is the part of China not including the Republic of China controlling Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. The term also excludes Hong Kong and Macau."
"In the Qing Dynasty (Manchu Dynasty), all of Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, the Pescadores, and Mongolia were part of the Manchu Empire. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau were colonized by foreigners for some years (Taiwan to the Japanese, Hong Kong to the British, and Macau to the Portuguese)."
"By the end the Qing Empire, China became Nationalist China (the Republic of China) and it got Taiwan back in 1945. After the Communists (the People's Republic of China) took over most of China, the Nationalists kept only Taiwan, Kinmen, Matsu, and the Pescadores. Mongolia became an independent state later."
"Since then, Communist China only includes the part on the continent (mainland) and some small islands that are very near (the largest communist island is Hainan). This region is Mainland China."
"Later Hong Kong and Macau were returned to the government of China, but because the government calls them ""special administrative regions"" under a ""one country, two systems"" idea, they are still not thought of as part of Mainland China."
Capital city
"A capital city, or capital town or capital, is a city or town, specified by law or constitution, by the government of a country, or part of a country, such as a state, province, or county. It usually serves as the location of the government's central meeting place and offices. Most of the country's leaders, embassy and officials work in the capital city. This doesn't have to be the case though: Monaco, Nauru, Switzerland and Vatican City are examples of countries that do not have a capital city. Israel said Jerusalem was its capital: Most countries don't recognise this, and most embassies are in Tel Aviv. In Japan, the city of Tokyo, which was the capital, was disbanded in 1943. Today, the 23 city districts (called wards) have the role of capital city. Each district is a city of its own, though. ""Capital city"" can also mean a city most famous for something, in this case, Capital of the World is a nickname."
Size.
"Capitals are usually among the largest cities in their regions and often are the biggest. For example, Montevideo is Uruguay's capital and its biggest city. The capital may also be the most important center of commerce, as in London or Bangkok."
"However, a capital is not always the largest city in a country. For example, the capital of India is New Delhi, which is smaller than Mumbai."
"In countries with subdivisions like the United States, the capitals of the federated states are often not the biggest cities. For example, New York City is the biggest city in the United States and in New York State, but is not the capital of either. The capital the country is Washington, DC, and the capital of the state is Albany."
"An unusual case exists in Canada since the federal capital, Ottawa, is not the largest city in its province, Ontario, which is Toronto. However, Toronto is the capital of Ontario, so Toronto is a provincial capital but not a federal one."
Number.
"Some countries have more than one capital for different purposes. For example, Bolivia has two (Sucre and La Paz) and South Africa has three (Pretoria, Cape Town, and Bloemfontein). In a city-state like Singapore, Monaco, and the Vatican City, the capital is the country."
"Not all countries have capitals. Nauru is a country that does not officially have a capital, but the district of Yaren, which is where the government is, can be called the ""de facto"" capital. Also, although many people consider the city of Bern in Switzerland to be the capital of the country, it is by law not the capital but the ""."""
Location.
"Capitals can be in cities that are already there like Athens or Rome, or a new town can be built and made the capital like Canberra and Alexandria. Countries can change capitals from time to time. Several cities have been the capital of China. The United States once had its capital in Philadelphia and later in New York City but moved to the new city of Washington, D.C. in 1800. Rio de Janeiro was the capital of Brazil until the new city of Brasilia was built between 1956 and 1960."
"According to Ernst Mayr, ""a subspecies is a ""geographic race"" that is sufficiently different taxonomically to be worthy of a separate name"""
Example.
"The key lime is a shrub that grows to a size of about 5 metres in height. It has many thorns. It produces a fruit that is yellow when it is ripe. This fruit is preferred by bartenders to mix cocktails. They prefer this lime, rather than the Persian lime."
"The lime plant originally came from southeast Asia, where it is native. It was taken to the Middle East, and Crusaders took it to Europe and North Africa. Spanish explorers took it to the West Indies and the Florida Keys. In 1926, a hurricane destroyed most of the commercially-grown limes in the region. The Persian lime was reintroduced then."
"Some of the original shrubs grew wild in the Florida Keys. It became clear that the originally introduced shrubs (now known as ""Mexican limes"") had modified their fruits. These were darker green than the original Persian limes, they also had a thicker skin."
More detail.
"In biological taxonomy, race is an informal rank below the level of subspecies. It may be used as a higher rank than ""strain"". There are various definitions. Races may be genetically distinct populations in the same species, or they may be defined in other ways, e.g. geographically, or physiologically. Genetic isolation between races is not complete (some interbreeding takes place between the groups)."
"However, the genetic differences are not (yet) enough to put the groups into separate species. The term ""race"" is recognized by some, but is not governed by any of the formal codes of biological classification."
Human beings.
"In former times, scientists often divided human beings into races. For example, they called people with a dark skin ""Negroid"" or ""black race"". But, human gene sequences are very similar compared to many other animals. This is one reason why modern biology says that there is only one human race."
Phenotype
The phenotype of an organism is the whole set of characters (or traits) of that organism.
"It does not mean just 'what you can see on the surface'. Rather, it means anything which can be made visible by suitable means. For example, blood groups are definitely a part of the phenotype. However, they are not visible just by looking at a person."
"In biology, the phenotype is distinguished from the genotype. This was proposed by Wilhelm Johannsen in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism's heredity and what that heredity produces. The distinction is similar to that proposed by August Weismann, who distinguished between ""germ plasm"" (gametes or their stem cells) and ""somatic cells"" (the body)."
The phenotype is important because it is exposed to natural selection:
"Phenotypes are determined mainly by genes and are influenced by environmental factors. So, knowing the genome of an organism does not give an exact prediction of its phenotype."
Traits vary greatly in how much they owe to heredity (nature vs nurture). The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship:
Extensions.
The term 'phenotype' must include characteristics that can be made visible by some technical procedure (such as blood types). Another extension adds behaviour to the phenotype since behaviours are also affected by both genotypic and environmental factors.
"The idea of the extended phenotype has been developed by Richard Dawkins to mean all the effects a gene has on the outside world that may influence its chances of being inherited. These can be effects on the organism carrying the trait, the environment, or other organisms. For instance, a beaver dam might be considered a phenotype of beaver genes, the same way beavers' powerful incisor teeth are phenotype expressions of their genes. Dawkins also cites the effect of an organism on the behaviour of another organism (such as the devoted nurturing of a cuckoo by a parent clearly of a different species) as an example of the extended phenotype."
Key lime
"The Key lime is a citrus fruit. Its Latin name is ""Citrus aurantiifolia"" (often, less correctly: ""C. aurantifolia""), or ""Citrus"" x ""aurantiifolia"" (Christm.) Swingle. It is also known as the Mexican lime, West Indian lime or Bartender's lime. It is a shrub that grows to about 5m in height."
"Its fruit is 2.5-5 cm in diameter (1-2 in). The fruit is yellow when ripe but usually, it is picked green. It is smaller, seedier, has higher acidity, a stronger aroma, and a thinner rind than that of the more common Persian lime. It is valued for its unique flavor compared to other lime. The Key lime usually has a more tart and bitter flavor. It is perhaps most distinguished as an ingredient in the Key lime pie."
"""C. aurantiifolia"" is a shrubby tree, that grows to 5 m (16 ft), with many thorns. Dwarf varieties are popular with home growers and can be grown indoors in winter in colder climates. The trunk rarely grows straight, with many branches that often originate quite far down on the trunk. The leaves are ovate 2.5–9 cm (1–3.5 in) long. They resemble orange leaves (the scientific name ""aurantiifolia"" refers to the leaves' resemblance). The flowers are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. They are yellowish-white with a light purple tinge on the margins. Flowers and fruit appear throughout the year but are most abundant from May to September ."
"""C. aurantiifolia"" originally came from Southeast Asia. It was introduced through the Middle East to North Africa and Europe during the Crusades. Spanish explorers then took it to the West Indies (at some point including the Florida Keys) contemporaneously with Columbus, then tropical and sub-tropical North America including Mexico, Florida, and later California . The English name ""lime"" was derived from the Persian name لیمو ""Limu"" in this course. ""Key"" would seem to have been added sometime after the Persian lime cultivar became more important commercially in the United States. This was after the hurricane of 1926. The hurricane destroyed most U.S. ""C. aurantiifolia"" plants. Some plants growing in the wild in the Keys survived the hurricane. Since the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect, many Key limes are grown in Mexico and Central America. They are also grown in Texas and California."
Age of Discovery
"The Age of Discovery or Age of Exploration was a period from the early 15th century that continued into the early 17th century, during which European ships traveled around the world to search for new trading routes and partners."
"They were in search of trading goods such as gold, silver and spices. In the process, Europeans met people and mapped lands previously unknown to them. Among the most famous explorers of the period were Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Pedro Álvares Cabral, John Cabot, , Juan Ponce de León, Juan Sebastian Elcano, Bartholomeu Dias, Ferdinand Magellan, Willem Barentsz, Abel Tasman, Jean Alfonse, Jacques Cartier, Samuel de Champlain, Willem Blaeu and Captain James Cook."
Portuguese Empire.
"Wollstonecraft was not only a writer, she was an early feminist and social campaigner. She wrote a children's book as well as her two most famous books ""A Vindication of the Rights of Man"" (1790), a response to the French Revolution, and ""A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"" (1792) which argued that women should have the same rights and education as men. She called for equal education for boys and girls, believing that education gives the tools necessary to compete with men in public and economic life."
"She followed writers such as Catherine Macaulay who wrote ""Letters on Education"" in 1790, Thomas Paine, and John Locke. One of her most well-known books was ""An Historical and Moral View of the Origin and Progress of the French Revolution (1794). She also wrote ""The Wrongs of Women"", a novel telling of the confines and illusion of marriage and child rearing as the only happiness for women. She was revolutionary in arguing for education and the need for autonomy for women."
"Wollstonecraft travelled to Paris in 1792 to take notes on the Revolution. While in Paris, she fell in love with Gilbert Imlay, an American who she later followed to London. She tried to commit suicide when their relationship ended but was rescued from the Thames. She wrote a book titled ""Letters Written During a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark"" (1796) from a series of letters written to Imlay, to support their daughter Fanny Imlay, born in 1794. In the same year, Wollstonecraft met an old acquaintance and philosopher, William Godwin. They later married."
"Wollstonecraft gave birth to their daughter on 30 August 1797. They named her Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin. The child later became wife of Percy Shelley. Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin became Mary Shelley, the author of ""Frankenstein""."
Wollstonecraft died of complications after labour due to a blood clot. Mary Wollstonecraft died of sepsis in London after her birth and suffered a similar fate as her best friend Fanny Blood whose death inspired her fight for women's rights and her first book.
"Her husband William Godwin published ""Memoirs of the Author of ""A vindication of the Rights of Women"""" in memory of her in 1798."
Isle of Wight
The Isle of Wight is an island county that is just off the south coast of England. It is about 40 kilometres (25 miles) by 20 kilometres (13 miles) in size. About one hundred and twenty thousand people live on the island.
"The Isle of Wight is a county. This means that it has a council of people who make decisions about some things that affect the people who live there. Until 1890 it was part of the administrative county of Hampshire. The county town of the island, which is the place where the council work, is ""Newport""."
Many people like to go on holiday on the island. There are many hotels and tourist attractions. Queen Victoria often visited the Isle of Wight where she owned a large mansion called Osborne House. Tourism is the most important industry on the island.
"Over half of the island is officially designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is widely recognised as the most important site in Europe for finding dinosaur remains, and is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve."

Alzheimer's disease
"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a brain disease that slowly destroys brain cells. As of now, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. With time, the different symptoms of the disease become more marked. Many people die because of Alzheimer's disease. The disease affects different parts of the brain but has its worst effects on the areas of the brain that control memory, language, and thinking skills. Alzheimer's Disease is the most common form of senile dementia accounting for up to 70% of cases."
"The clinical symptoms of AD usually occurs after age 65, but changes in the brain which do not cause symptoms and are caused by Alzheimer's, may begin years or in some cases decades before. Although the symptoms of AD begin in older people it is not a normal part of aging."
"At this time there is no cure for Alzheimer's, but there are treatments that can help some patients with the signs and symptoms so they do not affect them as badly. There are also treatments which slow down the disease so the damage to the brain does not happen as quickly. There are also certain personal habits that people can learn which may help to delay the onset of the disease."
"While it is not yet known exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease, there are a number of risk factors which may make a person more likely to get it. Some of these risk factors are genetic; changes to four different genes have been found which increase the risk."
"The current lifetime risk for a 65-year-old person to get Alzheimer's disease is estimated to be at 10.5%. It is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States causing about 83,500 deaths a year. In 2007, there were more than 26.6 million people throughout the world who were affected by AD."
"Alzheimer's disease was named after Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist and neuropathologist who first described the disease after studying the case of a middle-aged woman, Auguste Deter, who was a patient at a hospital in Frankfurt, Germany in 1906. The disease was named ""Alzheimer's disease"" in 1910 by Dr. Emil Kraepilin a co-worker of Alzheimer."
Tangles and plaque.
"Two of the main features found in the brains of people with of Alzheimer's disease, are ""neurobrillary tangles"" ('tangles' for short), which are made up of a ""protein"" called ""tau"", and ""senile plaques"" (which are made mostly from another protein called ""beta-amyloid"", they are also sometimes called ""beta-amyloid bundles"" or 'bundles' for short). The tau proteins that form the tangles previously held together a structure inside the neurons called a ""microtubule"" which is an important part of the neuron; it forms part of the ""cytoskeleton"" (cell skeleton) which is what maintains a cell's shape, and microtubules plays a part in cell communication."
"Both tangles and plaques may be caused by other diseases, such as Herpes simplex virus Type 1 which is being investigated as a possible cause or contributor in developing Alzheimer's. It is not known for sure if tangles and plaques are part of what causes Alzheimer's, or if they are the results."
Microtubules
"Microtubules are made of a protein called ""tubulin"". The tubulin is ""polymerized"", which is when molecules form the same shapes over and over again that are linked together in groups, and these groups are linked together. They can form long chains or other shapes; in this case the polymerized tubulin forms microtubules. The microtubules are rigid tubes like microscopic straws which are hollow inside. Microtubules help keep the shape of the neuron, and are inolved in passing signals through the neuron."
Tau
"Tau is a protein that is found mostly in the neurons of the central nervous system. They help hold together the ""microtubules"" within the neurons. and when changes happen in the way the tau proteins are supposed to work the microtubules break apart. The tau proteins which are no longer holding the microtubules together form strands called ""fibrils"", which then clump together inside the neuron to make what are called neurofibrillary tangles . These clumps, also known as 'tau tangles', are all that remain after a neuron has died."
Beta-amyloid
"Beta-amyloid(Aβ) (also called 'amyloid beta') plaques start with a protein called amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is one of the proteins that make up a cell's membrane or outer covering, that protects the cell. In this case a neuron.. As it is made inside the cell, APP sticks out through the membrane of the cell."
"The snare drum or side drum is a percussion instrument. It has strands of ""snares"" made of curled metal wire, metal cable, plastic cable, or gut cords. They are stretched across the skin on the bottom of the drum. Pipe and tabor and some military snare drums can have a second set of snares on the bottom side of the top head. This is used to make a ""brighter"" sound. The snare drum is considered one of the most important drums of the drum kit."
The snare drum can make some special sounds:
Economic boom
Economic boom is a phase when the economy has a huge increase. It is a natural cycle.
"The United States of America had an essential supply of natural resources such as timber, iron, coal, minerals, oil and land. Immigrants provided a plentiful and cheap work force to utilise these resources. This enabled America to become a huge economic power at the beginning of the 20th century. These resources were an important foundation for the economy."
"Whilst European economies suffered during the First World War, the USA experienced significant growth. US banks loaned money to Europe and businesses sold much needed goods. The war also provided a stimulus for inventions in production, materials and advertising. Immediately after the war there was a small slump but from 1922 the USA experienced an unprecedented economic boom."
"Electricity developed slowly before the war but during the 1920s the electricity industry experienced a huge boom. By 1929 the majority of houses in America had electricity and 70 per cent of them used it for lighting purposes. As a result of the development of factories to produce consumer goods for the American people, the demand for electricity doubled. Electrical power was introduced in factories to drive machinery, and thus it became possible to introduce mass production to a number of factories, e.g. refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and radio sets."
The car industry is the best example of mass production during the period. Henry Ford was a pioneer with his idea of producing affordable cars for the people of America. He set about realising his dream by producing his early cars in small workshops. He had groups of men working for him and gradually the cars were built.

"Henry Ford's hard work bore fruit. As he produced more and more cars, he could reduce his prices. By 1925 the price of a car was around $290, which was much cheaper than the price of $850 in 1908. Henry Ford was of the opinion that it was better to sell more cars for a small profit, as that meant employing more workers."
"By 1929 Americans owned 23 million cars. The workers earned good wages ($5 per day), thousands of jobs were created, roads were built, petrol stations were built, as were hotels and restaurants. Therefore, the entire economy was given a substantial boost due to the car industry."
"In order to help American people to purchase the new goods that were available, systems of hire-purchase and credit were introduced. This meant that a person could buy something by paying for it on a monthly basis. As a result, the majority of Americans could afford expensive goods. In order to encourage Americans to take advantage of the scheme, advertisements were placed on roadsides, on the radio, in newspapers and in cinemas."
"During the same period, chain stores appeared for the first time, e.g. J P Penney. Catalogue shopping also became fashionable as it was a convenient way of buying goods."
Tremors (movie)
Tremors is an American science fiction comedy horror movie. It is set in Nevada and is directed by Ron Underwood. The screenplay was written by S.S. Wilson and Brent Maddock.
Plot.
"Valentine and Earl want to go to Bixby, Nevada and they leave the Perfection Valley. A subterranean animal kills five people. The Perfection Valley is in danger."
Tremor
"In biology, a tremor is when antagonist muscles move repeatedly without being controlled. There are different forms of tremors. Very often, a tremor is a symptom for another condition, and not its cause. People with a tremor are not necessarily sick. For example, physiological tremors are measurable, but not visible; they occur in all humans."
Grignard reaction
"The Grignard reaction (pronounced ) is an organometallic chemical reaction in which alkyl- or aryl-magnesium halides (Grignard reagents) attack electrophilic carbon atoms that are present within polar bonds (for example, in a carbonyl group as in the example shown below). Grignard reagents act as nucleophiles. The Grignard reaction produces a carbon–carbon bond. It alters hybridization about the reaction center. The Grignard reaction is an important tool in the formation of carbon–carbon bonds. It also can form carbon–phosphorus, carbon–tin, carbon–silicon, carbon–boron and other carbon–heteroatom bonds."
It is a nucleophilic organometallic addition reaction. The high pKa value of the alkyl component (pKa = ~45) makes the reaction irreversible. Grignard reactions are not ionic. The Grignard reagent exists as an organometallic cluster (in ether).
"The disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they readily react with protic solvents (such as water), or with functional groups with acidic protons, such as alcohols and amines. Atmospheric humidity can alter the yield of making a Grignard reagent from magnesium turnings and an alkyl halide. One of many methods used to exclude water from the reaction atmosphere is to flame-dry the reaction vessel to evaporate all moisture, which is then sealed to prevent moisture from returning. Chemists then use ultrasound to activate the surface of the magnesium so that it consumes any water present. This can allow Grignard reagents to form with less sensitivity to water being present."
Another disadvantage of Grignard reagents is that they do not readily form carbon–carbon bonds by reacting with alkyl halides by an SN2 mechanism.
"François Auguste Victor Grignard discovered Grignard reactions and reagents. They are named after this French chemist (University of Nancy, France) who was awarded the 1912 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work."
Reaction mechanism.
The addition of the Grignard reagent to a carbonyl typically proceeds through a six-membered ring transition state.
Clothes.
"During the summer months, the Inuit were able to gather berries and roots to eat. They also collected grass to line their boots or make baskets. Often the food they found or killed during the summer was put into a ""cache"" for use during the long winter. A cache was created by digging down to the permafrost and building a rock lined pit there. The top would be covered with a pile of rocks to keep out the animals. It was as good as a freezer, because the food would stay frozen there until the family needed it. Inuit cultural traditions and traditional stories provided each new generation with the lifeskills and knowledge to survive their environment and work together. They usually moved around in small groups looking for food, and sometimes they would get together with other groups to hunt for larger animals such as whales. The men did the hunting and home building, and also made weapons, sleds, and boats. The women cooked, made the clothes, and took care of the children. Children and infants under the ages of 5 became easy victims of hypothermia, and if they were to die, their mothers would weight the children's corpses with stones and wrap them in fishnets before placing the bodies through holes in the ice. The mothers believed the children's souls were being offered to the god Phallus, who would reincarnate them as whales."
Some Canadian companies like Canada Goose and Moose Knuckle have clothing designs based on Inuit culture.
North American Arctic people today.
"Today, most Inuit live in modern houses. Many still hunt or fish for a major part of their food supply and sometimes some income. Seal pelts are used to protect from the extreme cold in the Arctic and are far more effective than man-made fabrics. The technology has worked well for many thousands of years. Besides, commercial winter clothes are expensive. Today, they use rifles and snowmobiles when hunting, however traditional values respecting the animals hunted still very much applies. In Alaska, many of the people have received money from the oil discovered in that state on their traditional lands."
"The Arctic is very different from the rest of the world. The way of life in the south does not work well in the north. Canada values having Inuit peoples in Canada's northernmost lands as proof of sovereignty over the Canadian portion of the Arctic Circle. It's a very challenging living in an Arctic environment. There is some controversy over the practice of sinking the corpses of child victims of hypothermia under the ice, as bodies have been known to drift through the currents and wash up on the eastern coast of Canada, and, upon occasion, the northeastern United States."
Basket
A basket is a container. It is usually light in weight.
"Basket makers use a wide variety of materials to create a basket, such as bark, willow rods, leaves, wire, plastic, paper, and rope. There are three basic kinds of baskets—coiled, twined, or woven. A woven basket is made of spokes and weavers: the spokes run up and down and the weavers go over and under the spokes. A coiled basket is made by sewing rings of a fibrous material to the previous ring. Twined baskets have flexible weavers that are twined around the spokes in a variety of patterns."
"Basketmaking is a very old practice; it features in myths from various cultures. Baskets were often used to carry fruits, berries, and other things to be gathered. Nowadays, baskets are less practical but still common. Ancient baskets can be found in many cultures. Basket weaving is one of these activities, either for practical use or fun. In Native American culture, basket weaving is a common activity."
"In basketball, the basket is an open net fixed to a metal ring in which players try to throw the ball."
Software
"Computer software, also called software, is a set of instructions and documentation that tells a computer what to do or how to perform a task. Software includes all different programs on a computer, such as applications and the operating system. Applications are programs that are designed to perform a specific operation, such as a game or a word processor. The operating system (e.g. Mac OS, Microsoft Windows, Android and various Linux distributions) is a type of software that is used as a platform for running the applications, and controls all user interface tools including display and the keyboard."
"The word software was first used in the late 1960s to emphasize on its difference from computer hardware, which can be physically observed by the user. Software is a set of instructions that the computer follows. Before compact discs (CDs) or development of the Internet age, software was used on various computer data storage media tools like paper punch cards, magnetic discs or magnetic tapes."
The word firmware is sometimes used to describe a style of software that is made specifically for a particular type of computer or an electronic device and is usually stored on a Flash memory or ROM chip in the computer. Firmware usually refers to a piece of software that directly controls a piece of hardware. The firmware for a CD drive or the firmware for a modem are examples of firmware implementation.
"Today, software has become an important part of our lives. software is used everywhere. software engineers are responsible for producing fault-free software which has literally become an essential part of our daily lives. Changeability and conformity are two of the main properties of software design. There are also different processing models for designing software including Build and Fix, Waterfall and Agile software processing design methods."
Types of Software.
"The different types of software can be put into categories based on common function, type, or field of use. There are three broad classifications:"
Container
A container is an object used for holding something. People put things in a container. The use of shipping containers is called Containerization.
South America
"South America is the continent to the south of North America. These two continents are separated by the Panama Canal. There are seven continents which make up the globe, South America being the 4th largest. South America includes 14 countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Falkland Islands (United Kingdom), French Guiana (France), Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela."
"South America is attached to Central America at the boundary of Panama. Geographically all of Panama – including the part east of the Panama Canal is usually included in North America alone, among the countries of Central America."
Natural resources.
"The soil in Argentina's Pampas is among the best in the world. Brazil's soil is very good for growing coffee. A great number of minerals have been found. Few, however, have been mined. Among those that were mined are iron, manganese, gold, and gemstones. The tropical forests are rich in valuable trees, like mahogany, ebony, and rubber. Oil is also a resource in some places."
Wildlife.
"South America is home to a large variety of animal life. These include animals such as jaguars, macaws, monkeys, anacondas, llamas, piranhas, toucans, rheas, tapirs, cougars, condors and chinchillas."

Evolution
"Evolution is a biological process. It is how living things change over time and how new species develop. The theory of evolution explains how evolution works, and how living and extinct things have come to be the way they are. The theory of evolution is a very important idea in biology. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a well-known evolutionary biologist, said: ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution""."
"Evolution has been happening since life started on Earth and is happening now. Evolution is caused mostly by natural selection. Living things are not identical to each other. Even living things of the same species look, move, and behave differently to some extent. Some differences make it easier for living things to survive and reproduce. Differences may make it easier to find food, hide from danger, or give birth to offspring which survive. The offspring have some of the things which made it easier for their parents to have them. Over time, these differences continue, and living things change enough to become new species."
"It is known that living things have changed over time, because their remains can be seen in the rocks. These remains are called 'fossils'. This proves that the animals and plants of today are different from those of long ago. The older the fossils, the bigger the differences from modern forms. This has happened because evolution has taken place. That evolution has taken place is a fact, because it is overwhelmingly supported by many lines of evidence. At the same time, evolutionary questions are still being actively researched by biologists."
"Comparison of DNA sequences allows organisms to be grouped by how similar their sequences are. In 2010 an analysis compared sequences to phylogenetic trees, and supported the idea of common descent. There is now ""strong quantitative support, by a formal test"", for the unity of life."
Evidence.
The evidence for evolution is given in a number of books. Some of this evidence is discussed here.
Fossils show that change has occurred.
The realization that some rocks contain fossils was a very important event in natural history. There are three parts to this story:
"1. Realizing that things in rocks which looked organic actually were the altered remains of living things. This was settled in the 16th and 17th centuries by Conrad Gessner, Nicolaus Steno, Robert Hooke and others."
"2. Realizing that many fossils represented species which do not exist today. It was Georges Cuvier, the comparative anatomist, who proved that extinction occurred, and that different strata contained different fossils.p108"
"3. Realizing that early fossils were simpler organisms than later fossils. Also, the later the rocks, the more like the present day are the fossils."
Geographical distribution.
"This is a topic which fascinated both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. When new species occur, usually by the splitting of older species, this takes place in one place in the world. Once it is established, a new species may spread to some places and not others."
Australasia.
"Australasia has been separated from other continents for many millions of years. In the main part of the continent, Australia, 83% of mammals, 89% of reptiles, 90% of fish and insects and 93% of amphibians are endemic. Its native mammals are mostly marsupials like kangaroos, bandicoots, and quolls. By contrast, marsupials are today totally absent from Africa and form a small portion of the mammalian fauna of South America, where opossums, shrew opossums, and the monito del monte occur (see the Great American Interchange)."
"The only living representatives of primitive egg-laying mammals (monotremes) are the echidnas and the platypus. They are only found in Australasia, which includes Tasmania, New Guinea, and Kangaroo Island. These monotremes are totally absent in the rest of the world. On the other hand, Australia is missing many groups of placental mammals that are common on other continents (carnivora, artiodactyls, shrews, squirrels, lagomorphs), although it does have indigenous bats and rodents, which arrived later."
"The evolutionary story is that placental mammals evolved in Eurasia, and wiped out the marsupials and monotremes wherever they spread. They did not reach Australasia until more recently. That is the simple reason why Australia has most of the world's marsupials and all the world's monotremes."
Evolution of horses.
"The evolution of the horse family (Equidae) is a good example of the way that evolution works. The oldest fossil of a horse is about 52 million years old. It was a small animal with five toes on the front feet and four on the hind feet. At that time, there were more forests in the world than today. This horse lived in woodland, eating leaves, nuts and fruit with its simple teeth. It was only about as big as a fox."
"About 30 million years ago the world started to become cooler and drier. Forests shrank; grassland expanded, and horses changed. They ate grass, they grew larger, and they ran faster because they had to escape faster predators. Because grass wears teeth out, horses with longer-lasting teeth had an advantage."
"For most of this long period of time, there were a number of horse types (genera). Now, however, only one genus exists: the modern horse, ""Equus"". It has teeth which grow all its life, hooves on single toes, great long legs for running, and the animal is big and strong enough to survive in the open plain. Horses lived in western Canada until 12,000 years ago, but all horses in North America became extinct about 11,000 years ago. The causes of this extinction are not yet clear. Climate change and over-hunting by humans are suggested."
"So, scientists can see that changes have happened. They have happened slowly over a long time. How these changes have come about is explained by the theory of evolution."
"Hawaiian ""Drosophila"" (fruit flies)."
"In about , the Hawaiian Islands have the most diverse collection of ""Drosophila"" flies in the world, living from rainforests to mountain meadows. About 800 Hawaiian fruit fly species are known."
"Genetic evidence shows that all the native fruit fly species in Hawaii have descended from ""a single ancestral species"" that came to the islands, about 20 million years ago. Later adaptive radiation was caused by a lack of competition and a wide variety of vacant niches. Although it would be possible for a single pregnant female to colonise an island, it is more likely to have been a group from the same species."
"Distribution of ""Glossopteris""."
"The combination of continental drift and evolution can explain what is found in the fossil record. ""Glossopteris"" is an extinct species of seed fern plants from the Permian period on the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana."
"""Glossopteris"" fossils are found in Permian strata in southeast South America, southeast Africa, all of Madagascar, northern India, all of Australia, all of New Zealand, and scattered on the southern and northern edges of Antarctica."
"During the Permian, these continents were connected as Gondwana. This is known from magnetic striping in the rocks, other fossil distributions, and glacial scratches pointing away from the temperate climate of the South Pole during the Permian.p103"
Common descent.
"Auckland occasionally suffers from air pollution due to fine particle emissions. There are also occasional breaches of guideline levels of carbon monoxide. While maritime winds normally disperse the pollution relatively quickly it can sometimes become visible as smog, especially on calm winter days. The west of Auckland is slightly wetter and cooler than the eastern side, with the gulf islands being warmer and drier still."
Capitalism
Capitalism is an economic system where means of production is privately owned and operated for profit.
"Most property is owned by people or companies, often called ""firms"", not by the government. It is often called private property. Capitalist economies are often close to free market economies, which means that prices move up or down according to the availability of products and how many people want them. People buy and sell things according to their own judgment. In most countries there is some regulation (trade laws) and some planning done by the government. They are sometimes called ""mixed economies"" to indicate this. Some people disagree on whether capitalism is a good idea, or how much of capitalism is a good idea."
"The word comes from ""capital"", meaning something of value that is used to make things. This can be money (""financial capital"") or any other goods that can be traded. The word ""capital"" originally comes from the Latin word ""caput"", meaning ""head."" It was used to mean how many ""head"" of cattle a rich person owned, in days long ago when cattle were used as money. In fact, the words ""capital"" and ""cattle"" both come from ""caput""."
"The philosopher Adam Smith's book, ""The Wealth of Nations"", was an important book that developed the ideas of capitalism and the free market. The word ""capitalism"" was not used until the 19th century. The greatest invention of capitalism is often said to be the joint stock company. A joint-stock company is a business where different stocks can be bought and owned by shareholders. Each shareholder owns company stock in proportion to the number of their shares."
"Buying, selling, working, and hiring."
"In capitalism, people may sell or lend their property, and other people may buy or borrow it. If one person wants to buy, and another person wants to sell to them, they do not need to get permission from higher power. People can have a market (buying and selling with each other) without anyone else telling them to. People who own capital are sometimes called ""capitalists"" (people who support capitalism are called capitalists, too). They can hire anyone who wants to work in their factories, shops or lands for them for the pay they offer."
"The word ""capital"" can be used to mean things that produce more things or money. For example, lands, factories, shops, tools and machines are capital. If someone has money that can be ""invested"", that money is capital too."
"In capitalist systems, many people are workers (or ""proletarians""). They are employed to earn money for living. People can choose to work for anyone who will hire them in a free market."
"This is different from many older economic systems. In ""feudalism"", most people were ""serfs"" and had to work for the people who owned the land they lived on. In ""mercantilism"", the government makes it hard to buy things from other countries. In many countries with ""mixed economies"" (part capitalism and part socialism) there are laws about what you can buy or sell, or what prices you can charge, or whom you can hire or fire."
Investing.
"An ""investment"" is when people invest (put) their money in things. People can put their money together to buy or build things, even if they are too big for one person to make alone. The people who invest get to be the owners of what they buy or build together. The stock market lets people buy and sell investments."
"Investing is important to capitalism. The word ""capitalist"" can mean two things: it can mean someone who likes capitalism; but it can also mean someone who invests. For example, a ""venture capitalist"" invests in new businesses."
"People who start businesses, or invest in businesses, can make a lot of money. A business sells things that people want. The investors make extra money, which is called ""profit"". Investors can take their profit and invest it in more businesses, or in making the business bigger. The investors can get more and more profit if the businesses are successful."
People who disagree.
"""Socialists"" and ""communists"" are people who do not support capitalism. They say it hurts workers, because businesses make more money by selling things than they pay the workers who make the things. Business owners become rich while workers remain poor and exploited (taken advantage of). They also argue society would be more efficient if people thought less about competing against one another for their own interests and thought more of working together for the overall good of society. Another argument is that each person has a right to basic needs (such as food and shelter). Within capitalism, sometimes people might not get everything they need to live. Capitalism is also said to be the main culprit of economic inequality."
"Karl Marx was a famous communist philosopher from Germany. He wrote a famous book called ""The Capital"" (or ""Das Kapital"" in German). He said that capitalism would go away after workers decided to take over the government in a revolution because of the exploitation. There were violent communist revolutions in many countries. Many people were killed because of this. But capitalism did not go away, and most of these communist systems have collapsed and do not exist today, or else they have become more capitalist. Some people think that communism in those countries did not work because Marx's ideas, though nice in thought, did not really work. Others think that communist countries collapsed because of the attacks (military, political and economic) from capitalist countries."
"Anarchists (that are not anarcho-capitalists) do not support capitalism either. They do not think there should be any bosses because it is a hierarchy. They think that Marxist–Leninist governments were unsuccessful because they were dictatorships that said that they would rule in the name of workers, but ruled in the name of their leaders. They think that these governments were state capitalist and not socialist."
People who agree.
"There are different words for people who support capitalism. In many parts of the world, these people are called either ""conservatives"" or ""liberals"". In the United States, the word liberal means someone who supports capitalism but wants some rules on what the market can do and cannot do. ""Libertarian"" is a word that in America and some other countries means someone who wants the government to have little or no power to tell people what to buy or sell."
"The reasons for capitalism are not just economic. They are political. People who like capitalism believe that capitalism provides liberty by the citizen by allowing them to be independent. Friedrich Hayek agreed with this and connected the open society with respect for the individual, and tolerance for the differences between people."
"Another argument for the endorsement of capitalism is that it is arguably better than other economic models, like communism, for example. While most communist nations (such as the Soviet Union and Democratic Kampuchea) collapsed deep in poverty, hunger, dictatorships and/or genocides, capitalist countries (such as the United States and the UK) prospered economically."
"People who support capitalism also have disagreements. Most people agree that capitalism works better if the government keeps people from stealing other people's things. If people could steal anything, then nobody would want to buy anything. However, if people shared everything, then no one would need to buy anything."
"In most countries, the government does more than that. It tries to make sure that people buy and sell fairly and that employment is fair. But most of the time, the government making sure that employment is fair is also on the benefitting side of capitalism. The government takes money in taxes and spends it according to what the governing body wants, often not what the citizens who elected the governing body want their taxes to be spent on. People in power spend money on guns and ships for the military. When the government is in charge of part of the economy, this is called a ""social democracy."" However, when the government spends money it causes arguments about what the money should be spent on, because often times we don't vote on policies, we vote on people we depend on making the policies."
"A few people think that people can protect themselves without any government. Instead of having laws against stealing, people could protect their own things, or agree to pay other people such as arbitrators, insurers, and private defenders to protect them. This belief is called ""anarcho-capitalism."" These people think that the government is trying to take away their earnings, because it takes taxes away from people against their will and keeps them from making agreements between themselves."
Ghana
"Ghana (formerly the Gold Coast) is a country in West Africa. Thirty-one million people live there; its capital is Accra. It is in Western Africa, bordering the Gulf of Guinea, between Côte d'Ivoire and Togo."
"Since Ghana is near the Equator, the climate is very warm and tropical. The eastern coastal belt is warm and comparatively dry. South west corner is hot and humid. The north is hot and dry. Lake Volta (the world’s largest artificial lake) extends through eastern Ghana."
Most Ghanaians have access to primary and secondary education. Ghana has a 6-year primary school system. There are 6 public universities and 10 private universities.
"I might start using the answering machine more, because it's so hard to not pick up that phone when it rings."
"Oh, it's great,"
I mean.
"Well, you know, in fact, I've been missing calls from the T I switchboard,"
"because I, I always have it on you know,"
Right.
"and I'll get that, that message that says, uh, to, uh, um, you know, uh, end this call, press three"
Sure.
"and I assumed I, you know, it was from the switchboard."
You know
"Yeah,"
you're probably right.
Yeah
"it is, because one day I listened, you know, and it was you know,"
"but, um, I, I just got totally disgusted,"
"and then, you know, people asking for, for money for everything, you know,"
"I mean.  Exactly,"
I understand.
"I mean, I,"
it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations
"and,"
"and, you know, the policeman's associations."
"I know,"
they call you one time to send three kids to the carnival or circus
"Oh, I used to do that."
"and,"
"Yeah,"
"I used to do that,"
"I'd send, or three kids to the movies or something"
Right.
There's always a
"and I, my, my pat answer now is, well, you just called me the other night,"
Uh-huh.
"Oh, yeah"
"I guess it's what sells newspapers, you know."
It's a very low way of living.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, so,"
"and, and, and as far as, uh, you know, myself having any particular personal, uh, knowledge or insight into politics or politicians, it, I'm not terribly involved in it."
Uh-huh
Just in a very cursory way.
Right.
I vote
"and I, you know, try to do whatever I can on the little local area,"
"but, I, I, it just is not one of the things that I have, uh, placed, uh, uh, a, a lot of my particular time and effort into,"
Yeah.
"so, I, I always feel very outside this kind of, uh, this kind of an issue."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"But, uh,"
I am kind of the same way.
"I just kind of read the paper follow up on I mean, you know, just keep an eye on what's going on"
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
right.
but I don't really play an active role in any kind of politics
"Yeah,"
"uh,"
"Uh, uh-huh."
"I'm not, I'm not in there,"
"I'm not one of those, uh, you know, volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever, uh, although I admire the people that do that"
and they certainly do get inside information
Uh-huh.
"really,"
especially in Texas
"Oh, I know it"
"The last gubernatorial race was, oh it was awful."
"It really was,"
yeah.
"So I don't know,"
"I, I,"
"it'll be interesting to see how the next, uh, few years go."
Yeah
Did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote.
"Yeah,"
"I think, well, it's, it's definitely a problem,"
and I think it could get worse.
Yeah.
"You know, we get this lackadaisical attitude,"
"and say, huh, you know, why should we vote,"
"then, you know, it could, uh, it could lead to some serious things."
Yeah.
"It also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in if, you know, not enough people are voting."
Uh-huh.
"Right, uh,"
"yeah,"
"we can get, uh, yeah, if we get someone in there like that, then, you know, they could make all sorts of changes that they were, you know, had enough pull."
"Yeah,"
"it's kind of like in Louisiana where that, uh, guy that's like a Ku Klux Klan member something got elected."
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Kind of scary when you think about that.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, who's the other guy, LaRouche that, uh, is sort of the, uh, socialist, not socialist but"
"he's so off the wall that, uh, he's gone in and tried to get into city elections"
"Well, you know, the little boy, the little one was trying to decide if there was a Santa Claus."
"Uh-huh,"
"oh, that's right"
"and the neighbor,"
they thought it was the neighbor.
They thought it was the neighbor.
He gave the two doubting Thomases a rubber band and a paper clip.
Yeah.
I thought that was wonderful.
"And then, uh, it, it's, it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor."
"And, uh, on Sunday, used to be on Sunday nights, now I can't figure out where they've moved it."
"On our, uh, public television, they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show."
Uh-huh.
"And it showed the latest, uh, developments from all the computer companies."
"Uh-huh,"
I've never seen that program.
"Well, you know, it's,"
"unless you're really into computers, you and software, you probably wouldn't be interested,"
Uh-huh.
"but I don't know,"
Uh-huh.
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there.
Oh.
"And, uh, you know, what, they, they covered everything from entertainment to spreadsheets, you know, and then they also, the hardware."
Oh.
Uh-huh.
So you could see what the new developments were and what to look for
"and, I enjoyed that."
Uh-huh.
It was just a thirty minute show with no commercials.
"Oh, okay."
"It's public television, course, doesn't have the commercials during the show"
"and, uh, if I catch him I call him"
and he comes back.
"So he, he's pretty good about taking to commands and and things."
Um.
Did you bring him to a doggy obedience school or just train him on your own
No
we never did.
"and,"
"I, I trained him on my own"
"and, uh, this is the first dog I've had all my own as an adult."
Uh-huh.
"We've had kid, or we've had dogs when I was a kid,"
"but this, this is the first one that I, uh, took in,"
"so I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it all right the first time,"
"but, uh, he, he seems to have picked it up pretty well."
I never really to hit him or anything.
Uh-huh.
"Just, you know firm tone of voice and those sorts of things."
Huh.
Really?
"I, I see other people out there"
"and they hit their dogs and try to,"
"and, and those horrible collars that they put on them with invisible fencing,"
"least I,"
Invisible what?
"Invisible fencing,"
have you heard of that?
"No,"
what is that?
"It's, uh, it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little, uh, transducers or emitters in your yard at the perimeter"
Oh.
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it
And  I love it.
Ah.
And I would get another one in a minute.
"Unless I could afford what I really like which would be a red Ferrari or, you know, a little Corvette or something like that."
And that's what would influence my decision to change because I like a really sporty car.
And I'd love an expensive one
"but I probably,  can never afford it"
so
"Uh, well I understand and can sympathize with that because I also enjoy driving performance automobiles."
"Uh, I currently have an eighty-seven, five liter Mustang G T that I've done a bunch of modifications to, to make it, uh, handle and perform better,"
Uh-huh.
"and I suspect if I were to be able to get another car where object was, uh,"
"the best car I could get regardless of money, uh, I probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a Lotus or possibly a Ferrari."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"Well, I'm a nurse here"
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red Ferrari.
"A, a three twenty-eight G T S?"
And I couldn't tell you
but it's just beautiful.
And I go out and I love to touch it
but I can't even do that because of the alarm.
You just go hunting?
"So, I just look at it a lot"
Go out and lust after it.
Really
Exactly.
But it sure is a pretty thing
So have you had the opportunity to drive a Ferrari?
No.
I'm working on it
"No,"
yeah.
That was hilarious.
"The, the, I guess the, the first, the first, uh, scene in that movie that really got my attention, uh, concerning the, the disease and all that was when he, uh, dropped the, the, uh, the toothpicks,"
Oh yes.
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image.
"Yes,"
yes.
Unbelievable.
"Well, you know there are people, uh, referred to as savants also, uh, who can do most phenomenal things"
Yeah.
and everyone feels they are totally retarded.
"Yeah,"
"because that's the way they, they might seem outwardly,"
That's right.
"but, boy there's a lots going on in there"
It's amazing
"Yeah,"
yeah
"and I, the, the, I think the, the best thing about RAINMAN was the, uh, the way that they put together the, the real awfulness of the, of the, of the disease, only,"
Yes.
"an, and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it, you know,"
"and, and, and you need to, to work with it, uh, you know, certainly on, on a daily basis but then then again work with it toward a good end. Not, not toward winning in Las Vegas, for example."
Yes
"and the,"
"Right,"
well the warmth that developed between them
"and again it, I think was a picture of relationships."
Yeah.
"Again the relationship, uh, between the two, uh, that, uh, never would have occurred, uh, by accident."
"Right,"
right.
"I was, uh, I was so impressed with that movie"
"I'm, I'm fairly newly married."
I've only been married less than two years
Uh-huh.
"and before that, I never owned a home or anything,"
so I never had any deductions.
"Right,"
right.
"So, really, it was always just money thrown away."
Thrown away.
"Yeah,"
jeez.
"And I never really thought about it because,"
You were good at it
"Yeah,"
"I was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never um, became a real problem until all of a sudden it came an insurmountable problem."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"I suspect that, you know, thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and, you know, the amount that I know they buy, I guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation, and, you know, just don't talk about it."
Yeah.
"Most, most people don't like to talk about money."
"They feel uncomfortable, I think."
"Uh-huh,"
"uh-huh,"
"You know, for a lot of people it is very personal."
very personal.
"Uh-huh,"
"yeah,"
"and especially if you, if you don't feel you're handling it quite right or that somebody might make fun of you or that it would be,"
Yeah.
"But I think the, the average American is probably pretty heavily in debt. Not, not including like a mortgage."
"A mortgage is an understandable debt because that's, you have, you have to have a roof over your head."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
"Uh, I work in metal fab"
"and tenths of inches are, are normal."
"And, you know, you know, it is broken up in, you know, the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for, in tenths, hundredths, thousandths, ten thousandths, of an inch."
"Well, have, have you, do you, are you involved in any other, uh, metric type things like ..."
"Yes,"
I am.
"I, I have a Suzuki motorcycle"
"and, and I've had motorcycles, Japanese motorcycles for years and years"
and the metric system comes easy to me.
But my ...
"I think it's interesting you you know, when you go out there"
and you're looking for a wrench
and you want the next size larger.
"I've got, I inherited some, some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds."
Right.
"Well, now that one's fairly easy, because that's probably slightly under half an inch."
"But some of them, like, like, twenty-seven"
"and, and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that, that, uh, don't translate."
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
yeah.
"To go from, from eighths to sixteenths to, uh, thirty seconds and remember where it falls, it ..."
Yeah.
"and, and you've got to go over there and try it"
"and I suppose, you know, I need a larger one."
I need a smaller one.
"I mean obviously you can look at it and say well, anyway."
"I think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't,"
"I don't know,"
"do you, do you drink adult beverages?"
"But,"
"What, what about the domestic effects"
"like I was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it, uh, possible and even popular to, uh, criticize the government."
"And they,"
"that pendulum started to swing, uh, maybe even too far. To the point where, uh, uh, supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional from the Vietnam war on."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"And that tradition is still,"
"I mean it's dying now,"
"but it's still alive as opposed to,"
"this Desert Storm stuff may have, uh  killed it."
Yeah.
"But I think that was one of the biggest,"
"that, you know, the, uh, the domestic unrest,"
Are you in the middle of anything?
No.
I'm not in the middle of anything.
"I've just,"
about the last thing I did
"about maybe, oh, close to a year ago now I guess, I, I helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house."
"So, I guess that,"
The whole thing?
Yeah.
"That, that was fairly large undertaking."
"A, a, it's a bedroom and a walk-in closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house."
Did the framing and all?
"Oh, we did it all except for the sheetrocking."
Huh.
"That was the only thing we didn't, you know, putting the ceiling up and things like that"
"we don't, we, we weren't sure how to do that"
and.
and I did all the sheetrocking and the interior work
"Yes,"
it's a very good book.
It's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then what to do with the money that you save.
Legally?
"Legally, cut money on your taxes."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
Huh.
"legally, legally cut money on your taxes, and on your insurance,"
"and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to, uh, you know, be wealthier. Uh,"
"he also has a new book out that I purchased right before I moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet. Um,"
"FINANCIAL SELF DEFENSE is the name of it. Uh,"
"the man, uh, has a lot of good ideas,"
"some of them I already knew about,"
some of them I had already practiced.
"But I suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because, uh,"
And that includes everyone at T I.
"Yes,"
I'm one of the ones that had my salary frozen for ninety-one.
Yes.
"Well, even, the, you know, the nonexempts, technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet."
Yet.
But when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter.
"You know, survival is a funny state."
"Yeah,"
I know what you mean.
"I, uh, when I was in Dallas I was supervisor,"
"and I had four non exempts, um, under me."
Yeah.
"And, uh, I was appalled at what, how they were paying them."
I just couldn't believe it.
"Did, well, I've been with the company for sixteen years now."
yes.
Oh
And I don't know that's true or not.
"I mean, I just heard it in passing,"
"but so what does that,"
Right.
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and
"And how is it really transmitted, et cetera."
Yeah.
"Which is, I think, what they also don't know."
"I mean that's,"
"I think they, they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say, you know."
Uh-huh.
"It was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble, you know, they just as soon not approve of anyway,"
"but, but that isn't how it was in Africa."
No.
"In Africa was the men and women and, and had nothing to do with that,"
and it's huge over there.
"So I, I, you know,"
"and it's beginning, other countries"
that's what's his point.
"This was an international, conference where people are saying, well, but in my country it's, you know, like this."
Uh-huh.
"And does that mean like flus and everything else, there are all these different strains of it?"
Oh.
I mean I don't know.
All I'm saying is I think it's scarier than we know.
"Uh, or maybe they understand but,"
I think maybe more information should be given out about it.
"Yeah,"
"and, uh, and then the people that have it,"
"it does seem that there are, are some drugs that are there that, you know, they keep holding back."
"so I bought one that's more like living in a,"
"once you're inside, you don't know you're in a town home."
"Oh, that sounds lovely."
It is.
They're kind of built on a catty-cornered instead of like side by side
Uh-huh.
so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you.
Uh-huh.
"So in, in your area then there's probably a lot of, um, career type people that have those type homes"
and
"Yes,"
definitely.
"uh-huh,"
"and, um, the area that we're settled in is, um, definitely young, young families with, with kids."
"They're still doing, um, a lot of building in the neighborhood."
"So the people that move here seem to move from all over the country, which we're from, um, the northeast,"
"and, um, seems like a people just don't, or also don't have any family around."
"So it, um, also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors,"
"and you know, um But, um ,"
"Well, we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees people who don't want the heat of Florida but don't want the heat of the, the cold of the northeast"
Uh-huh.
so they settle sort of in-between.
"Right,"
right.
Uh-huh.
"Now it's, um, is it very wooded around where you are,"
"there lots of pretty trees and,"
Yes
Yeah.
"as a matter of fact this is a, uh, this particular community that I live in is very wooded."
"Oh, how pretty."
It is nice.
the air bags are a good deal
"but, uh, surprisingly, uh, they're, uh,"
"you really need to do,"
"you need a combination of both the air bags and the, uh, and the seat belts"
"Oh I think so too,"
"so,"
I don't think they should do away with the seat belts now.
Yeah.
I'm
but I think you need the shoulder thing
Yeah.
"I think you need the thing around your waist,"
"but, I think you need that bag to pop out too."
Yeah.
"You know, because I know so many people, here that have been killed in head on collisions, where maybe if they had, had that, that air bag, they may still be walking around."
Yeah.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I think it's fantastic."
I wish they required it in everything.
"Every new car that came out, I wish they would require it in it."
"It would be that would do to our insurance rates, you know, if, if, uh, if the insurance companies says it, says we're not going to pay, you know, a claim, if, if the car doesn't have, uh, air bags."
Would be interesting wouldn't it?
Yeah.
"Uh, that wouldn't be fair"
"but, uh,"
"Well, no because what they would do is, that's what they're going to plan on, you know,"
"they would have to do it,"
the insurance company would have to do the same thing.
"They're given like, a ten year time limit where,"
Yeah.
okay.
"These cars, I guess they figure all the old cars, will be off the roads or something by the, in ten years"
"we can't do that,"
we just can't do that.
And I'm going well how about this way?
"I, I want to do that,"
that was the plan here
Right.
So we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of a cradle for it.
A cradle for it.
"Yeah,"
so you can steady it
"and then, you used a handsaw or a backsaw?"
"Well, it, the instructions in the book I had said use a coping saw"
"but there's no coping saw big enough to, for a fourteen inch wide watermelon <laughter> that"
"Right,"
right.
and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw.
"I said I'm not that steady,"
it's not going to happen.
Yeah.
So we built a cradle for it
"and we got once it was turned, we got one one cut out on the table saw, on the radial saw,"
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about
Right.
"So,"
Now did you cut a quarter wedge in this?
"Uh, I'd say it's about an eighth."
You know
"Well, I, I'm envisioning, uh, uh, a a watermelon like a log"
"and then, uh, what I've seen of this kind before is you have the, uh, the, uh,"
"it's, uh,"
"if you're looking at adding on you have,"
"Up here in Rochester, uh, we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution."
"I was a W F for several years,"
and it just never seems to improve.
"It, and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either, unless you're twenty-eight or above."
"Yeah,"
yeah.
It's really a shame.
"Well, I, I've, this company that they bought, they ended up buying a very high payroll."
Oh.
"And, uh, the, you know, I thought I was making a good wage,"
"So, how do you feel about the metric system?"
"Oh, I like it."
"I, I, I have a foreign, actually I have more than one foreign automobile."
"And I, I, I find the, uh, I find the, the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters,"
I was trying to build a shed
and they give you these measurements like forty-two and three eighths inches
"and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths, uh ..."
"Yeah,"
"and it's,"
I forget how many millimeters.
So you used the metric?
"Well, no."
"What we did was wind up using,"
"and you just go, you just go down"
"and, and you get out the, the, so many inches"
"and, and we just marked a little bit less than that, uh, which is somewhat awkward"
"but had it been millimeters, you could have done."
"I think what's interesting,"
"the way engineering people do is they,"
"they, in essence, have gotten around it by, by listing, uh, decimal inches."
"Uh, yeah,"
yeah.
Do are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that?
I saw it three times.
Did you.
"I can, I can tell you, oh, so much about that movie, just because it, it really rang, uh, rang a lot of my, uh, my personal background."
"I, I have a, a brother myself that's, that's older"
"and, uh, he's not, you know,"
"nothing, nothing, of course, serious is wrong with him"
"but, uh, but we have gone through these, these lapses of, of a relationship, somewhat, sometimes,"
Yes.
"and then, you know, uh, for, for, for no real, you know, direct reason, I guess, uh, we, we get into, uh, uh, a really good relationship for a while and then, you know, back and forth"
"so I, I was really able to, to relate to the, the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers."
That was neat.
Uh-huh.
"Well that's tremendous,"
"that, it's good because it does make you think, about your own family."
"Yeah,"
a lot.
And see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother.
Uh-huh.
"No question,"
"he, the, he was, he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that."
He likes the bang them up and shoot them up things.
Uh-huh
"And, and, uh, it, it was like pulling teeth to go get him to, to see it"
"but, uh, oh boy. He was, uh, uh, he, he gave the, the best response that I've heard him give of this type of movie for RAIN MAN."
"I mean he certainly didn't,"
"he only saw it one time,"
"and he didn't go back for more,"
"but, uh, he, he said he enjoyed it"
"and, and,"
Well he at least saw it one time
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
uh-huh.
"Well, it, it's, it's a really, day care programs are really neat, you know"
"and if the, if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that, that is one of the best things to do,"
but I think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active and their body just hasn't kept up with them
Uh-huh ery faint.
Right.
"and I think that's in a way it's more, some, an area where some of the day care, uh, programs have left off"
Uh-huh.
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those.
Right
"to, uh, get there and to participate in the activities."
Right.
"Cause I know, there's one not too far from from me here in Dallas."
"Uh, and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work and sports."
Right.
Right.
"But if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly,"
That's true.
You can't play those things.
"Yeah,"
you can't do it.
"But you can sing songs and, uh and tell stories about the old times."
"Well, that's true."
"I guess, you know, you were talking about your,"
"was it your grand mother that was having Alzheimer uh, being able to tell old stories."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with Alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way.
And they love to recollect.
"I mean they just, you know,"
and they will just go on and on with these stories
and they have such a memory.
Right.
"Do you know, I saw in Tom Thumb yesterday, I saw the return to the, uh, the small Coke bottles."
Yeah.
And I don't know if there's a deposit on those or not.
"I,"
"well that's interesting because,"
"they're back to glass, you're saying?"
"They were glass, they were the glass, uh,"
"well, let's see,"
"they'd be, I don't know, maybe ten ounce or six ounce or ten ounce. Sort of a small size, sort of a small size and, and we, anyway we just, we didn't stop and look them, look at them a long time"
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"but, and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down, you know, uh sort of, sort of a basket type thing."
Uh-huh.
The carton. The paper carton.
"Right,"
"right,"
"so, I hadn't seen that in a long time."
Yeah.
"Well, I mean the,"
"you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do, we were doing"
"and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons, the wood uh, racks which now, basically, you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold, uh, twenty-four bottles."
"And, and, uh, uh, I'm not really say going back to good old days,"
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now.
"Yeah,"
"yeah,"
"well,"
"Well, it will be interesting to see how, over the next year, this all works out because, like on the, uh, grass, I'm, I know your husband, uh, doesn't really like the paper sacks."
"No,"
he doesn't like the paper sacks
"and, uh, but he, but, you know, he likes to pick the grass up, too."
"He doesn't, Doesn't,"
"but they are, they'll take any T I non-credit union loan like if you have a fourteen percent loan for a new car."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Oh, really."
Uh-huh.
One of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through G M A C or something.
Uh-huh.
And she's doing it.
"I mean, it's not like, it's like."
Does she have to pay to have it refinanced?
I think they even cover that because they want you as a they want the T I to be part of the credit union.
Uh-huh.
"T I to,"
"See,"
we got ripped off buying our new car.
"We both come out of, uh, drugs and stuff,"
and we became Christians about five years ago.
"Right when he got home from Terrell. Right before he got hired for T I, he had gotten saved and stuff,"
"and so, I mean, when you get come out of drugs and stuff, you have nothing,"
"I mean, you know, you don't have anything."
"You have the clothes on your back,"
"and you might have a car, and that kind of thing."
"And so, when he, when he started working at T I, we, uh, you know, we really felt like God told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas."
"But we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years,"
and we were young
and we'd look about nineteen.
"People still think we're about,"
"they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff, both of us."
"And so, it's just kind of strange, you know,"
"so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs, you know."
Yeah.
"So we went in, and the financed the car for five,"
Uh-huh.
"but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment, they're not quite as, uh likely to do it as if, uh, if you get something back for it. You know."
As likely to do it.
Yeah.
"Yeah,"
that's true.
"And, uh, so, you know, if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings, anything that they can pass on to the consumer, you know, it kind of reminds me of using an A T M card, you know, to get money or doing your banking."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"You know, if it's free, people will use it,"
"if it costs them something, then they're not as likely to use it."
"Yeah,"
exactly.
You know.
"But, uh, I know we had a problem down here with, uh, oil, people taking oil out of their cars and just putting it down the you know, the the drain sewer."
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
"And, uh, all that, because there was,"
"apparently a lot of people, you know, every time they change the oil,"
they just dump all the their old oil down there.
Uh-huh.
Now they're starting to recycle that stuff.
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, another thing I thought of, I guess, to recycle would be like clothes, because I mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other."
"And one way that we do it sort of in, in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops."
Yeah.
"And that way, you know, you don't get near enough as, as much as you bought it for,"
"but you, you got the use out of it"
"and what you're going to basically donate to a Goodwill or whatever, anyways, you can get a little bit of money for."
Yeah.
"And so that's something that I've never,"
Yeah.
I'm trying to figure out how I can retire without having to work until I'm ninety-five.
Yeah.
We've been doing that too
We're trying to retire in our fifties.
Yeah.
"This is a very appropriate topic for our, uh, conversation today because what I'm figuring out is that I'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what I'm making"
"Good luck on that one, then."
What is that?
"I said good luck on that one, then."
"Well, we've got a pretty good situation, my wife and I, since our property is already paid for."
"You know, the main things that I like about the uh, in the job benefits would be the, uh, the availability of the health insurance and the availability of, uh, you know, being able to transfer around, inside the organization without having, you know, when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that is working on it, like some companies I know of."
Huh-uh.
"You know, they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going, on going project."
So you work for it T I then
You can't say?
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
"Yes,"
you do.
"Well, I work for D I S D"
"and I don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance,"
but Dallas doesn't pay.
"It pays most of mine, you know,"
"now, after you work I think five years, they begin to pay most of it."
"But then, for the, the family, you know, I put my kids on my policy."
It's like two hundred dollars
Huh-uh.
and it's gone up quite a bit
"and they predict, you know, of course, it's going to keep going up."
"I wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage, at some point."
"And benefits, you know,"
and we went ahead
"but, uh, not everybody can make that choice"
"and even, even though my wife wasn't working, we did have, uh, one or another of the boys in, uh, child care for just for part of the day. Uh, or a couple of days a week just so that, uh, other things could get done around the house and so on,"
"so, So, we did look around."
Huh.
I think my wife is much better than I am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not
"and, uh  so I would always trust her judgment on that."
Huh .
Huh. Well I'm just thanking heaven.
My husband just got a new job.
"His last company, he was only working four days a week."
Uh-huh.
"So it's,"
and he just got a new job.
"He's getting lots of overtime,"
he got a pay raise
and so I'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not.
There's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid
"so, yeah, do it as long you can"
I suppose.
"But I think, you know, you have to look through a place"
"and you have to get a feel for, uh, how they treat the kids and, uh, uh, what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you commit your child to them."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"And I think you have, the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open. That you're welcome anytime without notice, in the middle of the day and so forth"
"and if they're at all queasy about that then  I'd look elsewhere, yeah."
You have to start wondering if they don't want you.
Yes.
Right
Huh.
"You have other friends that have kids, uh, being taken care of in, uh, child care?"
"Uh, I have one"
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and, and, I, I, I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable with just a, just a bare majority."
Exactly.
"Uh,"
"Uh-huh,"
yeah.
"That's kind of how I, you know,"
"in certain cases I can see them going, uh, uh, just basically with a judge, guilty or not guilty verdict uh, simply from a judge in highly publicized cases versus the small, uh, maybe, you did a crime that was, uh, burglary or whatever"
Yeah.
Yeah.
and it goes into the court case or whatever
and it's not highly publicized.
But when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the NATIONAL ENQUIRER or whatever.
"Yeah,"
whatever.
Yeah.
"Uh, it's the idea that person might initially have this thought, well, jeez this person's guilty no matter what."
"I'm not going to listen to the facts or and, and con their way into, uh, getting past the lawyers and getting through that."
Yeah.
"But, uh, also there's aspect of cost"
"and I, I'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for, uh, the judicial system to try and call a jury, whether it's very costly, or if it's something that's not costly or what."
"You know, being that I'm not in the, that area I really don't know."
But I wonder if there is some big expense in trying to call a jury to trial and then having to pay whatever they have to pay if there's something that they have to pay.
Yeah.
I know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work. Or at least give them the time off from work.
Yeah.
"Uh, whether it's,"
I think it's with pay.
"If I remember, jury duty is with pay."
"Well,"
Hirschhorn has given lectures on the Hollywood musical at the University of Cape Town's annual Summer School and at the Oxford Literary Festival.
"Beginning in the mid-1980s, Hirschhorn has put together ""one of the world's finest collections of rare first-edition books"", largely consisting of ""almost all the most notable 20th-century authors"". The collection included all the major work of Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Graham Greene, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck."
"In October 2012, Hirschhorn made news when he put up for auction a significant portion of his extensive collection. ""The Express"" reported around 500 in all. Among the ""highspots"" were a jacketed first edition of ""The Great Gatsby"", an inscribed copy (to Hirschhorn by Harper Lee) of ""To Kill A Mockingbird"", Ian Fleming's first Bond novel, """"Casino Royale"""", Graham Greene's personal copy (with his signature on the front end-paper) of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", an inscribed copy of Evelyn Waugh's ""A Handful of Dust"" and a signed copy of ""Gone with the Wind""."
"Hirschhorn maintains an ongoing collection of film and theater-related material which is not for sale, with the aim to make it one of the most comprehensive private collections of film and theater material in the world."

"Second-order election is a term that appeared for the first time in Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt's ""Nine second-order national elections – A conceptual framework for the analysis of European election results"" article for the [European Journal of Political Research, in 1980]. It was used to analyze the first European Parliament elections, held in 1979 in the, then, nine member states of the European Economic Community. According to the ""second-order elections"" approach, European Parliament elections were ""second-order"" in that they were viewed as less important by voters, parties and the media than first-order elections."
"First-order elections are those that determine the government and/or executive power in a political system, i.e., national elections. They are first-order in that they are seen as more important by parties, voters and the media. Local and regional elections are also considered second-order elections."
"Second-order elections present the following characteristics: turnout is expected to be lower than in national elections, voters are more prone to vote for protest parties, or parties in the periphery of the political system, rather than the usual mainstream parties they would vote for in a national election. As a result, second-order elections are often used by voters to punish or reward the current governing parties."
"Regarding EP elections, empirical evidence has shown that all six EP elections (1979, 1985, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004) have been second-order elections. However, the second-order elections approach has not been confirmed for the twelve new member states of the European Union (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)."

The Octoraro Railway was a shortline railroad that operated in Pennsylvania from 1977 to 1994.
"The company was formed in 1976. It obtained a lease from SEPTA to operate freight trains on the Octoraro Branch, a former Pennsylvania Railroad branch line, between Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania and the state line near Sylmar, Maryland. It also leased the Wilmington and Northern Railroad, a former Reading Company branch, from Elsmere Jct. (Wilmington, Delaware) to South Modena (Modena, Pennsylvania). The company then created a connection between the two lines at Chadds Ford."
"The Octoraro Railway ceased operations on June 30, 1994. The Delaware Valley Railway acquired the company on July 1, 1994."
"Delaware Valley, a subsidiary of RailAmerica, operated the line until 1999, followed by the Brandywine Valley Railroad (BVRY). The Morristown and Erie Railway provided freight service from July 1, 2003, to November 18, 2004, but operated under the trade name of Octoraro Railroad. East Penn Railway took over operation in 2004 and purchased the right of way from SEPTA. In 2007 the company merged to become East Penn Railroad and operates the Octoraro line."
= = = Joel Oppenheimer = = =
"Joel Lester Oppenheimer (Jacob Hammer) (February 18, 1930 – October 11, 1988) was an American poet associated with both the Black Mountain poets and the New York School. He was the first director of the St. Marks Poetry Project (1966–68). Though a poet, Oppenheimer was perhaps better known for his columns in the ""Village Voice"" from 1969 to 1984."
"Oppenheimer was born in Yonkers, New York, attended Cornell University for one year in 1948, spent less than one semester at the University of Chicago, and in 1950 enrolled at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. At Black Mountain, he studied with Paul Goodman and poet Charles Olson, became friends with Fielding Dawson and Ed Dorn, and worked in the school's print shop."
"In his earliest poetry, Oppenheimer shows clearly the influence of William Carlos Williams, but he soon developed his own style. While at Black Mountain, Oppenheimer met and married his first wife, Rena Furlong. He left the school in January 1953 without taking a degree, eventually settling in New York and working in a print shop while continuing to write poetry."
"His first publications were ""The Dancer"" (1951), as ""Jargon"", no. 2, 1951, by The Sad Devil Press/Black Mountain College; ""The Dutiful Son"" (1956) by Jonathan Williams's Jargon Society, reprinted by LeRoi Jones's Totem Press in 1961, ""The Love Bit and Other Poems"" (1962), again with Totem. His satiric Western drama ""The Great American Desert"" was the first play produced by Robert Nichols, directed by Lawrence Kornfeld, who had been with the Living Theatre, at the Judson Poets' Theatre. It opened on November 18, 1961."
"Oppenheimer's poetry has been collected in two volumes: Robert J. Bertholf (editor, introduction), ""Collected Later Poems of Joel Oppenheimer,"" with eleven drawings by John Dobbs, The Poetry Collection, 1997 and ""Names & Local Habitations (Selected Earlier Poems 1951-1972),"" editor Jonathan Williams, The Jargon Society, 1988."
"He also published two nonfiction works, ""The Wrong Season,"" Bobbs-Merrill 1973, about the New York Mets, and ""Marilyn Lives,"" Delilah, 1984, on Marilyn Monroe.

"In addition to the desecration of the courthouse's loose paper records, either a Union Army officer or an Indiana unit confiscated an old Scots language Bible belonging to White, which had been passed down to him from his grandfather, John White. The ""old Scots Bible"" was purportedly taken as punishment against White for his support of the Confederacy."
"White left Romney with his wife and youngest children and traveled to Richmond where he was offered a position in the Confederate States Department of the Treasury within the government of the President of the Confederate States of America, Jefferson Davis."
"White died soon after his arrival in Richmond on October 9, 1862. He was interred by Scottish Rite Masons at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond. Distant relative Reverend Moses D. Hoge of the Southern Presbyterian Church, Bishop Duncan of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and Bishop Minegerode of the Southern Protestant Episcopal Church participated in White's funeral services."
"White's friends and family believed that he ""died of grief"" caused by the loss of his property in Romney and his concern for the safety of the records in the Hampshire County Courthouse during the conflict. In their ""History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present"" (1897), West Virginia historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher said of White:"
"White was married first to Alcinda Louisa Tapscott of Jefferson County, Virginia (now West Virginia), on December 15, 1815. Tapscott was White's cousin through his mother, Arabella Baker White. White and his first wife Alcinda had three children together:"
"White was married for the second time to Frances Ann Streit (March 19, 1811 – November 12, 1866), a daughter of Lutheran Reverend Christian Streit of Winchester, Virginia. Streit and her family were of Swiss descent. White and his second wife, Frances, had ten children (one of which died in infancy):"
"White and his family resided in a large brick mansion located along East Main Street (Northwestern Turnpike) which was later known as ""Liberty Hall"". Due to his upbringing in an affluent family, White was a person of means from a young age, and in his early adulthood he was able to construct a ""large brick mansion"" at this location. His original residence was destroyed by fire in 1857, and White replaced it with a more modest brick edifice where he resided until his departure from Romney in 1861 during the American Civil War. White's home was a ""seat of true old Virginia hospitality"" and it was frequented by all socio-cultural strata of Hampshire County and the greater Valley of Virginia region."
"During the construction of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in front of his residence. White won an appeal in court which caused the turnpike to be rerouted, thus creating the present curve on East Main Street in front of White's former residence."

""Consent involves submission, but the converse is not necessarily true...From the facts of case, all that is established is submission, and not consent...Is the taboo against pre-marital sex so strong as to provide a license to Indian police to rape young girls."" Later in January 1980 she formed the first feminist group against rape, ""Forum Against Rape"", widespread protests followed and eventually Indian Penal Code was amended."

"In 2010, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list as the most influential Muslim in the world for the second consecutive year. Ayatollah Syed Ali Khamenei maintained second place. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan moved into third place. Jordanian King Abdullah II was placed fourth above Moroccan King Mohammed VI who moved down to fifth place."
"In 2011, achievements of a lifetime were given more weight than achievements within the current year. which meant that the lists of names were going to change gradually, rather than dramatically, year-on-year. The Arab Spring had no impact on Saudi King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia's influence, it had boosted King Mohammed VI of Morocco's influence, who moved up to second place, and it had no effect on Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who came in third place."
"Erdoğan was expected by many to receive the top spot in light of the Arab Spring. Erdoğan was credited with Turkey's ""Muslim democracy"", and was seen as the leader of a country that, as the Brookings Institution said, ""played the 'most constructive' role in the Arab events."""
"Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani influence rose during the Arab Spring, moving him to sixth place. He had driven much of the Arab Spring through the coverage given by ""Al Jazeera"", given financial support to protesters and political support to Libya, making him arguably the biggest enabler of the Arab Spring."
"In 2012, the edition was published by S. Abdallah Schleifer, Professor Emeritus and Senior Fellow Kamal Adham Center for Television & Digital Journalism, The American University in Cairo."
"There were more Muslims from America than any other country again with 41 spots on the 500 list. Countries with the next highest number of names were Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom, with 25 Muslims each, followed by Indonesia, with 24. It lists the winners according to 13 categories, including spiritual guides, Quran reciters, scholars, politicians, celebrities, sports figures, radicals, and media leaders."
"For the fourth year running, Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz topped the list. He was followed by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at second place. Erdoğan's advance gave him advantage over Moroccan King Mohammed VI who took the third place. Fourth place went to Dr Mohammed Badie, whose name appeared in the top 10 for the first time. He was followed by Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who took the fifth place. Sheikh Al-Azhar Dr. Ahmad el-Tayeb and prominent Islamic scholar Dr. Yusuf al-Qaradawi who is President of Global Association of Muslim Scholars, also made it to the top 10 ranks."

"In 2013, the list was edited once again by Professor Emeritus S. Abdallah Schleifer of the American University in Cairo."
"The top of the list went to Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, the Grand Sheikh of the Al Azhar University for the prominent role played by him in Egypt's troubled democratic transition His astute decision making over the past couple of years has preserved the traditional approach of Al-Azhar which faced threats from Islamists and Salafis in the years that have followed Mubarak's fall. His public support of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's coup also gave it a strong religious grounding that was necessary for it to achieve the legitimacy needed to prevent a civil war, effectively making him a ""king-maker"" and cementing his place at the top of the list. He was followed on the listing by Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul-Aziz Al-Saud and Iranian Grand Leader Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei."
"Reflective of the wider trajectory of the Arab Spring, this year's list showed a decline in influence from Muslim Brotherhood associated figures Dr Mohammed Badie, Sheikh Yusuf al Qaradawi and ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi. Coup kingpin General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi who was previously unlisted now ranks at 29."
"The US dominates the list again with 41 inclusions including Muhammad Ali, Dr Mehmet Oz, Rep. Keith Ellison, Yasiin Bey (Mos Def), and Fareed Zakaria. Representing the UK are Mo Farah, Yusuf Islam, Riz Khan, Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, Cambridge's Dr Timothy Winter and 18 others."
"In 2014, the chief editor of the list was again Professor S Abdallah Schleifer. The top spot went back to Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, due to his being the ""absolute monarch of the most powerful Arab nation."" The list accords him the place in light of Saudi Arabia being home to Islam's two holy cities of Makkah and Madinah, which millions of Muslims visit throughout the year, as well as the kingdom's oil exports. Rounding out the top three are Dr Muhammad Ahmed al-Tayeb, grand sheikh of Al-Azhar University and grand imam of Al-Azhar mosque, and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The top nine are all political leaders and royals, including Morocco's King Mohammed VI and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan."
"The top 50 fit into six broad categories: 12 are political leaders (kings, generals, presidents), four are spiritual leaders (Sufi shaykhs), 14 are national or international religious authorities, three are ""preachers"", six are high-level scholars, 11 are leaders of movements or organizations. In total 72 Americans are among the 500 most influential Muslims, a disproportionately strong showing, but only one among the top 50, Sheikh Hamza Yusuf Hanson of Zaytuna Institute listed at number 38."
"In 2015, the top 50 was again dominated by religious scholars and heads of state. The top five, was King Abdullah of Jordan; Ahmed el-Tayeb, the grand sheikh of Egypt's Al-Azhar University; King Salman of Saudi Arabia; Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and King Mohammed VI of Morocco. Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan came in at Number eight, but surprisingly Syrian President Bashar al-Assad did not make the Top 50 this year or last, though he is still listed in the 500. The prime minister of Iraq did not make the list, but Iraq's Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Hussein Sistani did, coming in at number nine."
"There was 32 newcomers to the 2016 list. 22 Indians featured on the list. As in past years, there continued to be more Muslims from the United States than any other country. Since at least 2012, the U.S. has outpaced nations with a far larger Muslim population, with at least 40 notable people of influence, with Pakistan (33), Saudi Arabia (32), Egypt (27) and the UK (27)."

"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 (), also commonly referred to as ""the farm bill,"" is one of two United States ""farm bills"" that were introduced in the 113th United States Congress. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is the bill that was introduced into the United States Senate. A second bill, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 () was introduced into the United States House of Representatives. The two bills cover similar topics and programs, but have significantly different provisions. The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 passed the Senate on June 10, 2013 and has received the support of the President."
"However, the Senate bill failed to pass in the House, so the two chambers organized a conference committee. The result is the Agriculture Act of 2014 (H.R. 2642; 113th Congress), which passed the House on January 29, 2014. The Agriculture Act of 2014 includes provisions from both the House and the Senate bills."
"One of the major provisions of the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 is a $4 billion cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a controversial provision, with some Democrats arguing that the cuts were too large, while some Republicans arguing that the cuts did not do enough to cut the deficit."
"A ""farm bill"" is one of the primary tools of the United States federal government to set policy related to agriculture in the United States. Farm bills are passed roughly every five years. The farm bills typically cover laws and policies related to supplemental nutrition, land payments, crop insurance, environmental practices, some international trade, and research."
"A similar bill to the proposed Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was also passed by the Senate in the 112th United States Congress, but never received much attention in the House and failed to become law. The current ""farm bill"" expires on September 30, 2013."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would cut spending $24 billion over 10 years. Overall, however, it would still cost nearly $955 billion over 10 years."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would reduce spending on food stamps by $4 billion over 10 years."
"""This summary is based largely on the report on S. 954, as it was reported by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry on May 14, 2013, written by the Congressional Budget Office, a public domain source."""
"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that direct spending stemming from the program authorization in S. 954 would total $955 billion over the 2014-2023 period. That 10-year total reflects the bill’s authorization of expiring programs through 2018 and an extension of those authorizations through 2023, consistent with the rules governing baseline projections that are specified in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
"Relative to spending projected under CBO’s May 2013 baseline, the CBO estimates that enacting the bill would reduce direct spending by $17.8 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""The estimated budgetary effects of S. 954 are summarized in Table 1."" CBO estimates that section 10012 of the bill would increase revenues by $54 million over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of the changes in direct spending and revenues are displayed in Table 2."""
"Assuming appropriation of the specified and necessary amounts, the CBO also estimates that implementing the bill would cost $30.1 billion over the 2014-2018 period and $39.9 billion over the 2014-2023 period. ""Further details of that estimate are displayed in Table 3."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). In general, state, local, and tribal governments would benefit from the continuation of existing agricultural assistance and the creation of new grant programs."
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 would impose private-sector mandates, as defined in UMRA, by expanding reporting requirements on manufacturers of dairy products and establishing regulations for dairy handlers that purchase milk from dairy producers participating in the Dairy Market Stabilization Program. Additionally, the bill would prohibit individuals from attending animal fighting ventures in states and U.S. territories that permit such ventures. Because the compliance cost for dairy handlers would depend on future regulations, the CBO has no basis to determine whether the aggregate cost of the mandates in the bill would exceed the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($150 million in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation)."
"The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or revenues. Enacting S. 954 would affect direct spending and revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures apply. ""The net change in outlays and revenues that are subject to those pay-as-you-go procedures are shown in Table 4."""
"The Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 was introduced into the Senate on May 14, 2013 by Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). The bill was considered on the Senate floor on May 21–23, and June 3–4, June 6, and June 10, 2013. On June 10, 2013, the bill passed in the Senate in Recorded Vote 145: 66-27. Only two Democrats voted against their party: Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI). Eighteen Republicans voted in favor of the bill."
"As of June 24, 2013, the United States House of Representatives had not considered the Agriculture Reform, Food, and Jobs Act of 2013 or added it to a calendar. On June 20, 2013, Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) urged the House to take up consideration of the bill, speaking from the Senate floor. The Senator argued that because the Senate bill had received the support of many Republicans and cut spending, the House should have no objections to passing it as well. The bill was not put on the Majority Leader's calendar for the week of June 24."
Thiocyanic acid is a chemical compound with the formula HSCN which exists as a tautomer with isothiocyanic acid (HNCS). The iso- form tends to dominate with the material being about 95% isothiocyanic acid in the vapor phase.
"It is a weak acid, bordering on strong, with a p""K"" of 1.1 at 20 °C and extrapolated to zero ionic strength."
HSCN is predicted to have a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen. It has been observed spectroscopically but has not been isolated as a pure substance.
"The salts and esters of thiocyanic acid are known as thiocyanates. The salts are composed of the thiocyanate ion (SCN) and a suitable metal cation (e.g., potassium thiocyanate, KSCN). The esters of thiocyanic acid have the general structure R–SCN."

"Ypiranga Clube, or Ypiranga as they are usually called, is a Brazilian football team from Macapá in Amapá, founded on May 15, 1963."
"Home stadium is the Zerão stadium, capacity 5,000. They play in blue and black striped shirts, black shorts and black socks."
"The club was founded on May 15, 1963, by the initiative of the father Vitório Galliani, vicar of Igreja Nossa Senhora da Conceição, who lead young members of Juventude Oratoriana do Trem (JOT), a movement connected to Vitório Galliani's church. Under influence of Vitório Galliani, it was established that the club's official colors would be black and blue, the same colors of Italy's Internazionale, club supported by the father. Guaracy Freitas was elected as the club's first president."
"In 1963, the club joined Federação Amapaense de Desportos. In 1964, Ypiranga disputed its first competition, the Second Division of the Amapaense Amateur Football Championship, and managed by Francisco Sales de Lima (nicknamed ""Chicão""), the club won the competition, after defeating Independente 6–3 in the final, at Augusto Antunes Stadium. The champion team was composed of the following players: Manguinha, Lindoval, Barata, Guaracy and Suzico, Adauto and Ary, Peninha, Artur, Narciso and Almeida. The reservers: Elcio, Horácio, Otílio, Gadelha, Lery, Trombone, Tônati, Sabá Balieiro, and Joaquim Neto."
"In 1976, Ypiranga won its first state championship, after the club and Santana drew 0–0 at Estádio Municipal Glicério de Souza Marques. The champion players were Emanuel, Buiuna, Damasceno, Waldir and Pitéo, Duranil and Dival, Ananízio, Tadeu, Jason and Dilermano, and the reserves were Odival, Paulo César, Bolinha, Orlandino, João Oliveira, Padeirinho Dewson and Nena. In 1986, after a poor campaign, Ypiranga was relegated to the Second Division of Campeonato Amapaense. However, the team won the second division in 1987, returning to the first division in 1988."
"In 1991, under the administration of the chairman Luiz Góes, Ypiranga became a professional team. In 1992, Ypiranga reached its first professional competition title, after winning the state championship. The players of that team were Maurício, Zé Preta, Ponga, Cid and Neirivaldo, Edgar, Edvaldo and Serginho, Tiaguinho, Miranda and Jorginho Macapá, managed by Dadá Maravilha, who had won the 1970 World Cup as a player."
"Ypiranga's home stadium is Estádio Milton Corrêa, usually known as Zerão, inaugurated in 1990, with a maximum capacity of 5,000 people. It is famous for having its halfway line positioned exactly over the Equator."
"Ypiranga's logo is uncommon, because it features a church's tower. This church's tower is located at Igreja de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, which is a church located in Trem neighborhood. The club's nickname, Clube da Torre, is also a reference to the church's tower, and means ""Tower Club"" in English. Ypiranga's mascot is a creature very similar to Warner Brothers' Taz, but wearing the club's shirt, a club's themed Baseball cap and black leather jeans."
= = = Shakespeare Santa Cruz = = =
"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was an annual professional theatre festival in Santa Cruz, California, which ran from 1981 to 2013. After losing the financial support of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the company was relaunched through crowdfunding as Santa Cruz Shakespeare."
"Shakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 and performed annually on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Plays by Shakespeare and other great dramatists were performed indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Bringing in professional actors, directors and designers from throughout the country, the Company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory six days a week (no performance on Mondays). With a mission to “cultivate the imagination, wit, daring, and vision that the greatest playwrights demand of artists and audiences alike,"" SSC sought to present a festival of theatre which showcased contemporary approaches to directing, designing and acting. Attendance grew from 7,716 people in 1982 to 31,013 in 1992. Since its founding, the company's artistic directors have been Audrey Stanley (1982–86), Michael Edwards (1987–92), Danny Scheie (1993–95), Risa Brainin, Paul Whitworth (1996–2007), and Marco Barricelli (2008–2013). Some of the rising theatre stars who have worked at SSC are: David Aaron Baker, Bryan Cranston, Maria Dizzia, Dan Donohue, Caitlin FitzGerald, Richard Gunn, Peter Jacobson, Carrie Preston, Reg Rogers, and Michael Stuhlbarg."
"In 1997, Artistic Director Paul Whitworth introduced the SSC annual Winter Holiday season. In keeping with the tradition of Shakespeare Santa Cruz’s fresh take on the classics, the holiday shows were original musicals written for SSC by playwright Kate Hawley with music composed by Gregg Coffin, Craig Bohmler and Adam Wernick. A fusion of the traditions of the British pantomime and the American musical, ""Cinderella"", ""Gretel and Hansel"", ""The Princess and the Pea"" and ""Sleeping Beauty"" were based on traditional fairy tales and appeal to audiences of all ages. The winter season performed in November and December."
"In addition to the summer repertory season and the holiday show, Shakespeare Santa Cruz had two performance programs which sought to engage student actors with Shakespearean and other classical texts---the summer Fringe show and the Shakespeare to Go program. The Fringe show was an opportunity for the summer Company's acting interns to perform their own production in the Glen two nights each summer. Past productions included ""Lysistrata"", ""The Antipodes"", ""Fools in the Forest"", and ""The Mock-Tempest"". Shakespeare to Go was an educational engagement program—and recipient of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding—featuring University of California Santa Cruz Theater Arts students who toured local schools in the spring performing one-hour versions of one of the full-length plays to be featured in the summer repertory season. Additionally, Shakespeare to Go presented a limited number of free public performances."
"The festival was responsible for supporting itself, but had recently run deficits which were paid by the University of California. In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts. An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation. Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised. Claiming continuing financial problems, however, the UCSC Arts Division dean announced several years later that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after its 2013 holiday production."
"Following this announcement, the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through crowdfunding to continue on without the financial support of the university. In March 2014, the new company changed its name to Santa Cruz Shakespeare."

"Two versions of ""Cherry, Cherry"" have been released. The version familiar to most listeners was recorded in late January 1966 and released by Bang Records in mid-1966, and was recorded as a demo, with Butler on keyboards, and Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich on backing vocals and hand-claps.

"Currently, the DPS system is used by online shops for product delivery as an alternative to regular post services. Private customers can send their packages through the system as well and pay for the delivery on the spot with a debit or credit card. The system also encompasses an SMS-based notification system notifying clients when an item has been delivered. SmartPOST's solution was implemented in April 2009."
"Unlike other similar systems (such as the Packstation solution in Germany), SmartPOST has placed its Delivery Point Solution indoors (e.g. in shopping malls), making them convenient to use even with bad weather. In July 2009, SmartPOST reported it is in negotiations with an Italian company interested in licensing SmartPOST's Delivery Point Solution for usage in Italy."
Currently SmartPOST is servicing roughly two hundred distant selling companies and online shops in Estonia.
"During its first year of operation, SmartPOST reported a 13.8 million EEK (about 1.2 million USD) turnover with an 8.3 million ($740,000 USD) profit loss. SmartPOST's member of board Antti Oolup said that the loss was expected and planned, with monthly profits planned for the end of 2009. SmartPOST reported that over 33 thousand packages were sent through its service in Estonia in December 2009."
"SmartPOST was chosen as the Logistics Deed 2009 at the annual Purchase Management and Logistics Conference. At the end of 2009, SmartPOST also reported that it will expand its business to Finland. Currently, only one-way packages can be sent from Estonia."
"In November 2010, SmartPOST's CEO position was taken over from Indrek Oolup by Risto Eelmaa."
"In October 2009, Estonia's national postal company Eesti Post filed a complaint with the Estonian Consumer Union, claiming that SmartPOST's television advertisements were damaging the reputation of Eesti Post and also ""calling viewers up to violence against elderly people"". SmartPOST responded that the claim was untrue and damaging reputation or calls for violence were not their intention."
"In July 2010, the Estonian Development Fund (majority shareholder in SmartPOST) sold its share to the Finnish postal service and logistics company Itella. Raivo Vare, Head of the Estonian Development fund commented on the sale, saying: ""Risk investment is a field where there are few success stories, but SmartPOST is definitely one of them. Sale of SmartPOST is even better than it looks."" The Estonian Development Fund reportedly earned €1.3 million from sale of SmartPOST."

"In family law, the Court can order a Residence Order of the Family Court under section 8 of The Children Act 1989 following the breakdown of a marriage and determining where the children are to live and with whom. The order can be sole or joint, and if joint, it can be made to a couple regardless whether they are married. If a residence order is granted, this automatically gives him, her, or them parental responsibility for the child(ren) which will continue until the order terminates (usually this will be until the child(ren) reach their sixteenth birthday unless there are exceptional circumstances justifying a longer period)."

"If an applicant cannot apply for the Order as of right, (e.g. they are wider family members such as grandparents etc. who wish to seek orders for their grandchildren), they can make an application to the court seeking leave to issue the application. In deciding whether to grant leave, the court will consider, amongst other things:"
"As a matter of public policy, the courts have always operated under the doctrine of ""parens patriae"" to make the best interests of any children their first and paramount concern. From time to time, this doctrine has been included in statutes, the most recent relevant version being section 1 of The Children Act 1989 which requires the court to consider the ""welfare checklist"".

If a Guardian is appointed but the children and the Guardian do not agree on what recommendations to make to the court and the children are of sufficient age and understanding, they will be able to instruct a solicitor directly to represent their views and the Guardian will present an independent view to the court. Whether or not a Guardian is appointed, the court can request a Welfare Report under section 7 of The Children Act 1989, either from the local authority where the child currently resides or from a Children and Family Reporter who is an officer appointed by CAFCASS. The report will usually inform the court of the child's wishes and feelings, but the officer will recommend what he or she thinks is in the child's best interests in the circumstances of the case rather than just advocate the child's wishes."

"On 1 July 1971, Bratislavské Automobilové Závody (BAZ) was founded, sub-contracted to produce Škoda Auto models, but with all pressings and parts supplied by the Czech-based partner. The factory began producing the Mladá Boleslav-designed 731 (saloon) and 732 (station wagon), as well as other BAZ marketed small (MNA) and medium-sized trucks (SNA). Later vehicles developed included the 3-door Locusta coupé."
"After developing a partnership with Tatra, the company also produced military vehicles, including the popular Praga V3S."
"BAZ vehicle production ended in 1982, when the production of the Škoda Garde was started, with the resultant development of the factory spurring the construction of new apartment blocks in the borough of Devínska Nová Ves. However, parts supply from the parent plant in the Czech Republic was slow, resulting often in a number of part-finished vehicles being held in storage, often awaiting singular parts. The factory later produced the Škoda Rapid 130/135/136, as well as a variety of parts for other car manufacturers in Czechoslovakia."
Some prototypes from BAZ can be seen in Museum of Transport in Bratislava.
"After the fall of the Iron Curtain, in May 1991 Volkswagen Group bought an 80% share of BAZ. Skoda Auto production continued, and was expanded to include other models within the VW Group portfolio, initially the Volkswagen Passat. In 1998 Volkswagen Group bought out the remaining company shares, and renamed the company Volkswagen Slovakia. Volkswagen then bought the remaining shares in Skoda Auto in 2000."
"Since VW developed their large SUV platform, the factory has become a specialist producer of all VW Group marques large SUV's, which presently include the Audi Q7 and the Volkswagen Touareg, and the co-designed Porsche Cayenne which is based on the same platform. It is also the only VW Group factory to produce the Golf Syncro four-wheel drive. Since December 2011 the factory has produced the VW up!, as well as the badge-engineered SEAT Mii and Škoda Citigo for European markets."
"The factory area of the plant currently covers an area of . Bodies are assembled and welded in one of two body shops, and then painted with one of 26 standard colours in the paint shop. The co-located Aggregate/Modules hall produces gearboxes for both on-site consumption and various models of the VW Group brands. The bodies are moved to the assembly hall, which covers an area equivalent to 21 football pitches, where the painted body is mated with the pre-assembled under-body and chassis. The VW Group and Porsche models then split."
"The Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Toureg and Up! variants are completed by installing the finishing components including wiring, wheels, seats and the steering wheel. The final assembled SUV is then transported via cable car to the co-located test track for a final on-road test. If the car then passes a further inspection, it is prepared for dealer delivery."
"Since 2016, the Bentley Bentayga has also been produced at Bratislava."
"DHL handle all shipping and distribution arrangements from the site, via railway (70%) or road. Aside from on-site body pressings, gearbox production, and various under-body and drive train components sourced from the Martin plant; 90% of parts are delivered to site from Volkswagen's component consolidation centre in Wolfsburg, Germany, shipped directly to site via 10 daily trains."
"First and second generation Porsche Cayenne models were sent direct to shipping once the body has been mated with under body. They were then shipped directly by rail to the Porsche factory in Leipzig, Germany, where interior fitting out, finishing and inspection were completed. Third generation Porsche Cayenne are being completely produced, and finished directly in Bratislava."

"Scènes de Ballet is a suite of dance movements composed in 1944 by Igor Stravinsky. It was commissioned by Broadway producer Billy Rose for inclusion in the revue ""The Seven Lively Arts"" that opened at the Ziegfeld Theater on December 7, 1944."
"""The Seven Lively Arts"" brought together a number of notable performers: Beatrice Lillie, Bert Lahr, Benny Goodman, and ""Doc"" Rockwell as well as showgirls - ""the prettiest around at the moment,"" according to ""The New York Times"" review."
"The solo dancers for the ""Scènes de Ballet"" were Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin (who was also the choreographer). Although Rose had requested a 15-minute work, ""the music was cut to a fraction of its original length when ""The Seven Lively Arts"" ... opened in New York."""
"""Scènes de ballet"" is a score of between 16 and 18 minutes' duration, written in 1944. It was commissioned by Billy Rose for a Broadway revue. The music occasioned one of the best-known Stravinsky anecdotes. Rose telegraphed Stravinsky: """" To which Stravinsky telegraphed back: """""
The score is in nine sections. The timings are those of the composer's 1963 recording.
"A cake was made which was called Soddag Valloo or Dumb Cake, because it was made and eaten in silence. Young women and girls all had a hand in baking it on the red embers of the hearth, first helping to mix the ingredients (flour, eggs, eggshells, soot and salt) and kneading the dough. The cake was divided up and eaten in silence and, still without speaking, all who had eaten it went to bed, walking backwards, expecting and hoping to see their future husband in a dream or vision. The future husband was expected to appear in the dream and offer a drink of water."
"Other means of divination was to steal a salt herring from a neighbour, roast it over the fire, eat it in silence and retire to bed; or to hold a mouthful of water in your mouth and a pinch of salt in each hand as you listen to a neighbour's conversation, whereupon the first name mentioned would be that of your future spouse."
"Traditional food for Hop-tu-Naa includes ""mrastyr"": potatoes, parsnips and fish mashed up with butter. Any leftovers from this evening meal would be left out with crocks of fresh water for the fairies. Toffee would also be made, with just sugar and water, as a communal activity on the evening of Hop-tu-Naa."
Different versions of Hop-tu-naa songs were sung in different areas of the island.
"""Jinnie the Witch"" is a modern Manx English song, which was sung around the Douglas area."
"According to Hampton Creer, Jinny's real name was Joney Lowney. She lived in Braddan and was tried at Bishop's Court for witchcraft in 1715 and 1716. Her greatest ""crime"" was stopping the Ballaughton Corn Mill. She was sentenced to 14 days' imprisonment, fined £3 and made to stand at the four market crosses dressed in sackcloth."
The modern song goes as follows :
"In the west of the island a longer version was sung, which is more closely related to the Manx version."
"The following version dates from the 1930s – a similar version is recorded in ""A Vocabulary of the Anglo-Manx Dialect"" by A. W. Moore, Sophia Morrison and Edmund Goodwin (1924):"
"The 1970s southern version from Castletown includes the mention of the Witches Mill, the Smelt Monument and the Old House of Keys:"
"When lights were turned out and no sweets were given, there was a further chorus:"
"New songs for Hop-tu-Naa continue to be created, the most notable of which was written by Scaanjoon in 2015, having been commissioned by Culture Vannin. This has been taken up by the Manx traditional music youth group, Bree, as a part of their repertoire."

= = = Coleophoridae = = =
"The Coleophoridae are a family of small moths, belonging to the huge superfamily Gelechioidea. Collectively known as case-bearers, casebearing moths or case moths, this family is represented on all continents, but the majority are found in temperate areas of the Northern Hemisphere. They are most common in the Palearctic, and rare in sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Australia; consequently, they probably originated (like most or all other Gelechioidea families) in northern Eurasia. They are relatively common in houses, they seek out moist areas to rest and procreate."
"These ""micromoths"" are generally of slender build, and like in many of their relatives, the margins of their wings usually consist of a ""fringe"" of hairs. The tiny caterpillar larvae initially feed internally on the leaves, flowers, or seeds of their host plants. When they emerge to feed externally, they usually construct a protective silken case, discarded and built anew as they grow and molt. The common names of the Coleophoridae refer to this habit."
"The bagworm moths (Psychidae), which also belong to the primitive Ditrysia (although to superfamily Tineoidea, not Gelechioidea), build similar cases as larvae. As opposed to these, though, the case-bearer females leave their cases to pupate and have normally developed wings as adults, instead of being neotenous as female bagworms usually are."
"About 95% of the over 1,000 described species have been placed in the ""wastebin genus"" ""Coleophora"". Many proposals have been made to split smaller genera from ""Coleophora"", but few have been accepted, due to the uncertainties about which species are closest to the type species of ""Coleophora"" – ""C. anatipennella"" – and thus would remain in the genus."
"Regarding the family's circumscription versus other Gelechioidea, it is by now far less disputed than usual for this superfamily. The Blastobasidae, Momphidae (mompha moths), Pterolonchidae, and Symmocidae have formerly been included in the Coleophoridae as subfamilies, but are more often considered separate families today. With the internal relationships of Coleophoridae genera (as far as they are widely accepted) and species essentially unresolved due to the classification problems mentioned above, no subfamilies or tribes are accepted in the family for the time being."
Genera of case-bearers at least provisionally accepted by recent authors include:

It is located in the Cape Peninsula, near Simon's Town towards Cape Point, near Cape Town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. It is also commonly known as Boulders Bay. It is a popular tourist stop because of a colony of African penguins which settled there in 1982. Boulders Beach forms part of the Table Mountain National Park."
"These African penguins are only found on the coastlines of Southern Africa - (South Africa & Namibia). These penguins are currently on the verge of extinction. As a result, the penguins are under the protection of the Cape Nature Conservation."
"Although set in the midst of a residential area, it is one of the few sites where this vulnerable bird (""Spheniscus demersus"") can be observed at close range, wandering freely in a protected natural environment. From just two breeding pairs in 1982, the penguin colony has grown to about 3,000 birds in recent years. This is partly due to the reduction in commercial pelagic trawling in False Bay, which has increased the supply of pilchards and anchovy, which form part of the penguins' diet."
"Bordered mainly by indigenous bush above the high-water mark on the one side, and the clear water of False Bay on the other, the area comprises a number of small sheltered bays, partially enclosed by granite boulders that are 540 million years old."

"Egocentric presentism is a form of solipsism introduced by Caspar Hare in which other persons can be conscious, but their experiences are simply not ."
"Similarly, in related work, Hare argues for a theory of perspectival realism in which other perspectives do exist, but the present perspective has a defining intrinsic property."
"In one example that Hare uses to illustrate his theory (starting on page 354 of the official version of his paper), you learn that you are one of two people, named A and B, who have just been in a train crash; and that A is about to have incredibly painful surgery. You cannot remember your name. Naturally, you hope to be B! The point of the example is that you know everything relevant that there is to know about the objective world; all that is missing is position in it, that is, whose experiences are , A's or B's. This example is easily handled by egocentric presentism because under this theory, the case where the present experiences are A's is fundamentally different from the case where the present experiences are B's. Hare points out that similar examples can be given to support theories like presentism in the philosophy of time."

"The Burgess Model I, also known as the ""Burgess I-Scout"" and the ""Coast Defense Hydroaeroplane"", was a United States reconnaissance seaplane built for the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps in 1913. It was of conventional Wright Model B design but with an engine mounted amidships in an enclosed fuselage, driving by chains two large pusher propellers mounted on the interplane struts. The undercarriage consisted of twin pontoons. The single example built, S.C. No. 17, was delivered to the Army in January 1913 at the Burgess Company and Curtis factory in Massachusetts, then transported to Florida to complete the training of two officers. After the assignment, it was disassembled and moved to the Philippines in September 1913, where it was in and out of service several times before crashing into the sea near Corregidor on January 12, 1915. It is notable as the first U.S. Army aircraft to conduct two-way radio communication with the ground in December 1914."
"The Burgess Model I was placed into service as Signal Corps Number 17 (S.C. No. 17) in January 1913 to complete the training of Lieutenants Loren H. Call and Eric L. Ellington at Palm Beach, Florida. Following this assignment it was disassembled and shipped by sea to the Philippine Aviation School near Manila, arriving in the first week of September. When it was uncrated for assembly, it was found to have been damaged so severely in transit that both its upper and lower wings needed replacing. 2d Lt. Herbert A. Dargue, a Coast Artillery officer trained as a pilot at the Philippine Aviation School, was detailed October 18 to fly the plane, based on the beach at San Jose on the south side of Corregidor in Manila Bay. After it was placed back into service in November 1913, it was found that center-of-gravity problems with its front-and-back seating arrangement and heavy pontoons made it incapable of taking off with two persons aboard. Dargue continued one-man operations and with a Coast Artillery officer devised a primitive method of signaling with small parachutes and a Very pistol to indicate misses."
"S.C. 17 was reconditioned by January 1914 with lighter pontoons that permitted two-man operation. Its hangar was supplied with a cement floor and a marine railway built down to the water to assist in launching the aircraft. The S.C. No. 17 participated in maneuvers with ground troops in February but was damaged during landing on February 20, and was out of service for a month. Between April 28 and May 15 it resumed adjusting fire for the Coast Artillery before going into storage for the rainy season."
"When he resumed flying activity in the fall of 1914, Dargue began testing a small radio transmitter-receiver built by a local unit, and was damaged again in October experimenting with antenna location. Ultimately a wire antenna was paid out behind the aircraft in flight from a reel. Further problems of engine noise, ignition interference, burnout of the signal detector by proximity of the transmitter, and loss of calibration from engine vibration were all overcome. On December 1, 1914, Dargue and 1st Lt. Joseph O. Mauborgne, the Signal Corps officer in charge of the Fort Mills radio station, began a series seven test flights of the radio. During the third, on December 11, the first two-way telegraphy communication with the ground was performed, at a range of for communication with the ground and for the return signal to the airplane, flying at an altitude of , the first radio signal received by an airplane. On the last flight, December 16, using a switch designed to alternate between receiving and transmitting modes, Mauborgne conducted the first airborne ""conversation"" with the ground."
"On January 12, 1915, Dargue and an enlisted spotter encountered strong winds over San Jose Bay. Dargue lost control attempting to avoid the cliffs on Corregidor, but was able to recover sufficiently to crash-land the plane tail first in the bay, causing a total loss. Because S.C. No. 17 was the only aircraft left in the Philippines, the Philippine Aviation School was closed and Dargue transferred back to San Diego, California."

"Chester Weir is a weir which crosses the River Dee at Chester, Cheshire, England, slightly upstream from the Old Dee Bridge (). The weir and the associated salmon leap are recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building."
"This was originally the site of a causeway across the River Dee. The weir was built in sandstone in 1093 for Hugh Lupus, 1st Earl of Chester, for the Benedictine Abbey of St Werburgh (now Chester Cathedral). It was designed to provide a head of water for the medieval mills on the river. The mills were demolished during the 20th century and the weir was restored to serve the Chester City Council's hydro-electric power station, which operated from 1913 to 1939 on the site of the former mills."
The weir continues to provide three essential roles in maintaining the very substantial water abstractions from the River Dee. It prevents tidal water ingress up-river for all but the highest tides; it provides the water head for an abstraction immediately behind the weir and it holds back what is a long linear lake which enables that largest abstraction to be taken at Huntington for the United Utilities supply to the Wirral and surrounding areas.
"The weir can be navigated by crossing over the top during high spring tides. On the city-side of the weir is the United Kingdom's only example of a weirgate, a low height single lock gate that can be opened to provide extra draft once the water levels on each side of the weir have equalised. This allows carefully planned passage from the non-tidal River Dee, via the short tidal estuary section, onto the Dee Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal (originally the Chester Canal) at certain times of year."

However, it has a history which is significantly different, due to various social pressures, and the self-image of rugby union in general. As a result, this history has been largely hidden until comparatively recently, although the game is gaining a higher profile thanks to international tournaments and financial investment."
"The secretive nature of the early years of women's sport—and especially rugby union—ensures that we do not really know where it began. Public reaction to women playing contact sports could be disrespectful, or even violent. In 1881, when two teams played a number of exhibition ""football"" games in Scotland and northern England, several games had to be abandoned due to rioting in or around the grounds."
"While most of these games appear to have been played to the new Association Football rules, it is clear from reports in the ""Liverpool Mercury"" of 27 June 1881 that at least one of these games, played at the Cattle Market Inn Athletic Grounds, Stanley, Liverpool on the 25th, involved scoring goals following ""touchdowns"" and may therefore have been played to at least a version of rugby rules."
"Whether this was the case is unknown. However, a series of sporting cigarette cards, published 1895 in the Liverpool, includes an image of a woman apparently playing what looks like rugby in kit very similar to that described in reports of the 1881 team (see left). It is therefore possible that these ""exhibition"" games similar to those in 1881 may have continued (with no press reporting) or the pictures may have been reprints for earlier illustrations inspired by the 1881 games, or they may just be an ""amusing"" cartoon or an illustration of a sport that was not actually being played. Again no further details are available."
Other than this the official record is silent for most of the nineteenth century. Some girls played the game unofficially as part of their school teams—and the earliest confirmed record of any female definitely playing rugby at any level anywhere in the world comes from a school game.
"This happened at Portora Royal School in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Emily Valentine's brothers were responsible for the formation of the school's first rugby team in c1884. Emily practised with the team and in c1887 she played for the school, scoring a try."
The first documented evidence of an attempt to form a purely women's team is from 1891 when a tour of New Zealand by a team of female rugby players was cancelled due to a public outcry.
There are also early reports of women's rugby union being played in France (1903) and England (1913) but in both cases the game was largely behind closed doors.
"During the First World War some women's charity games were organised, the most well documented taking place at Cardiff Arms Park on 16 December 1917, when Cardiff Ladies beat Newport Ladies 6–0. Maria Eley played full-back for Cardiff and went on to become probably the oldest women's rugby player before she died in Cardiff in 2007 at the age of 106. The Cardiff team (who all worked for Hancocks a local brewery) all wore protective headgear, which predates their male counterparts by some decades."
"In Sydney in 1921, two women's teams played a game of rugby league in front a crowd of 30,000—a photograph appeared in ""The Times"" in 1922—but pressure from authorities ensured that they did not play again. Throughout the 1920s a popular form of women's football game very similar to rugby called ""barette"" was played across France. The game had only minor differences to the full game (games were 10-a-side and had some minor restrictions on tackling) and there were national championships throughout the decade. It received support from several male rugby players and film also exists of a game being played in 1928. Both barette and the full game of rugby featured in several newspaper cartoons and many photographs exist. For reasons unknown the game appears to fade away in the 1930s."
"In 1930 a women's league playing the full game was formed in Australia, in the New South Wales areas of Tamworth and Armidale, which ran until halted by World War Two. Photographs of women's teams also exist from New Zealand from the same period and during the war Maori women took up the game. After the war in 1956 The ""Belles of St Mary’s""—an Australian women's rugby league team—played games in New South Wales—but even as late as the 1960s Women's rugby was banned in Samoa."
"The 1960s was the decade in which the game finally began to put down roots, initially in the universities of Western Europe. In 1962 the first recorded UK women's rugby union team appears at Edinburgh University, in 1963 female students participate in matches against male students in London, and in 1965 university sides are being formed in France."
"As the pioneering students left university an adult game began to evolve. Initially (1966) this tended to be confined to charity matches between male and female teams (especially at Worthing RFC, England), though the UK's ""Daily Herald"" newspaper includes photographs of girls' teams training in Thornhill, near Dewsbury in Yorkshire in 1965, and at Tadley in Hampshire in 1966—and appealing for fixtures. It is not recorded whether these teams did arrange any games, and so it is not until 1 May 1968 that the first fully documented and recorded women's club match takes place, in France, at Toulouse Fémina Sports in front of ""thousands of spectators"". The success of the event lead to the formation of the first national association for women's rugby union—the ""Association Francaise de Rugby Feminin"" (AFRF) at Toulouse, in 1970."
"1970 also saw the first reports of women's rugby union in Canada, and by 1972 four universities in the United States were playing the game: University of Colorado, Colorado State University, the University of Illinois and the University of Missouri. By 1975 university students at Wageningen in the Netherlands were playing, and in the same year clubs appeared in Spain (Arquitectura in Madrid and Osas in Barcelona). The first non-university clubs formed in 1978 in Canada and Netherlands, and in Italy (Milan) a year later."
"By 1980 there were club championships in the United States and Sweden, and provincial championships in New Zealand. The game first appeared in Japan in 1981 and in February 1982 University College, London's women's team went on a tour to France playing, amongst other teams, Pontoise—the first recorded overseas tour by a UK team (and possibly the first international tour by any team). A few months later on 13 June 1982 the first women's international—Netherlands 0, France 4—took place at Utrecht (see Women's international rugby union for more details on the history of the international game)."
"In the UK 1983 saw the Women's Rugby Football Union (WRFU) formed to govern the game across the British Isles. Founder member clubs are: Leicester Polytechnic, Sheffield University, University College London, University of Keele, Warwick University, Imperial College, Leeds University, Magor Maidens, York University and Loughborough University."

= = = Mr. Blotto = = =
"Mr. Blotto is a jam band from Chicago, Illinois. They blend hard rock, original rock, southern rock, folk music, and country rock. They formed in 1991, and continue to tour extensively in the midwest area. Along with their seven album releases and four DVDs, they have also released four ""official bootleg"" albums of their live recordings. Their most recent release ""Live at the Leaf"" chronicles a weekend in New Orleans playing at the legendary Maple Leaf. It was released in 2018."
"The core of Mr. Blotto is the brother songwriting team of Mike and Paul Bolger, who had played together in garage rock bands throughout high school. They went in separate directions musically when they attended different colleges, Mike leaning towards the hardcore punk stylings of Hüsker Dü, and Paul focusing on the resurgence of 70s rock like Aerosmith, while eventually discovering Crosby, Stills and Nash and the Grateful Dead, who would later become huge influences. After Paul graduated he decided to pursue the life of a full-time musician while Mike opted to become a lawyer. Paul landed a gig as the house singer in a Polish club in Chicago called ""The Cardinal Club."" It was here that Paul met guitarist Bob Georges and they decided to begin playing together."
"Earlier the Bolger brothers played in the 1980s in a group called Fred, alongside future members of the Freddy Jones Band."
"Paul and Bob found drummer Alan Baster at a jazz night, and hired him on. After several auditions for a bass player yielded no results, Paul convinced Mike to be an interim bass player. The band as a four-piece started hitting Chicago area open mic nights and outlying bars, developing their roots-oriented jamband sound and weaving a large amount of reworked Grateful Dead songs into their sets to supplement the originals being penned by Paul, Mike and Bob. As their audience grew, Mike quit being a lawyer and became a full-fledged member."
"They released Parking Karma and found their way into the larger bars and venues of the Chicago scene. After the album was released, Dave Allen - an old college bandmate of Paul's - joined on keyboards, filling out the bass-acoustic guitar-electric guitar-keyboards-drums ensemble that has remained consistent through personnel changes since."
"In addition to Piano, Synths, & Hammond B-3, Dave supplied another singing voice and an ability to improvise lyrics that complemented a long-standing element of the early Blotto show, the ""Reggae Rap,"" in which Paul would freestyle over a rock-steady type of beat."
"In the mid-90s, they released a second CD, ""Bad Hair Day,"" and continued their process of steadily playing shows in the Chicago area. By the end of the decade they had built their audience to the point that they were a significant draw at local performances and festivals."
"1998 saw a third CD, Ancient Face; in 1999 Bob Georges was replaced by Mark Hague. The introduction of Mark (who had played with the Freddy Jones Band) marked a creative period for the band, and he helped pen the next generation of Mr. Blotto tunes. Paul, Mark & Mike started meeting every Monday to work on new original ideas. In these sessions, any idea would be chased down and put to tape. These songs became Cabbages and Kings, the 4th CD which (93.1) WXRT called the band's best release yet."
"Around this time, the band addressed the constant demand for a Live Record. Mr. Blotto had been, from its inception, an improvisational band and had always allowed people to record the shows. A taper path was built that included an analog to digital converter, a distribution amplifier, and an open invitation for all to enjoy the high quality of a constant gain board patch in either digital or analog. As a result, clean Mr. Blotto boots began to cross the country, often in advance of the band—this is especially true outside of the Midwest, where they rarely tour."
"Seeing as not everyone had a portable CD burner or DAT, Mr. Blotto began issuing Live Shows and Compilations. The Bootleg Series is a single CD of songs handpicked by the band for their unique characteristics, where the Just Did It series is made up of double disc sets from one particular show or run of shows."

"""Missulena bradleyi,"" also known as the eastern mouse spider, is a species of spider belonging to the family Actinopodidae. The spider is endemic to the eastern coast of Australia."
"William Joseph Rainbow described the eastern mouse spider in 1914 from a specimen collected in North Sydney by Henry Horton Burton Bradley (1845–1918), president of the board of trustees of the Australian Museum at the time. Describing the ""beautiful and strikingly marked"" specimen as a ""decided novelty"", Rainbow named it in honour of its collector, whom he stated was the first collector of Australian spiders."
"Eastern mouse spiders are often mistaken for Australian funnel-web spiders. The females are large and very strong, with powerful chelicerae. Their fangs often cross over slightly, while those of Australian funnel-web spiders remain parallel, and the latter often have a drop of venom on their fang tips and have longer spinnerets."
"The male, which has an all-black carapace and a pale bluish area on top of the abdomen, roams around in autumn and early winter looking for a mate. They sometimes fall into swimming pools when wandering. Cases of envenomations have peaked during this period."
The burrow can be found by brushing away loose soil in an area where they live until a flap of silk indicative of the entrance is found.
"Common symptoms of eastern mouse spider bites are numbness and tingling at the bite site, sweating (diaphoresis), headache, and nausea generally. Although it appears to be the most dangerous member of the genus, serious envenomations by this species are relatively rare. Most bites documented in the medical literature did not require use of antivenom or involve serious symptoms. Their venom has been found to have toxins similar to the robustoxin found in Australian funnel-web spider venom, and Australian funnel-web spider antivenom has been found to be effective in treating severe mouse spider bites. Compared to the Australian funnel-web spider, however, the eastern mouse spider is far less aggressive towards humans, and may often give ""dry"" bites."

"Figshare was launched in January 2011 by Mark Hahnel and has been supported by Digital Science since a January 2012 relaunch. Hahnel first developed the platform as a personal custom solution for the organization and publication of diverse research products generated in support of his PhD in stem cell biology. In January 2013 Figshare announced a partnership with PLOS to integrate Figshare data hosting, access, and visualization with their associated PLOS articles. In September 2013, the service launched an institutional repository service, which offers organizations a pre-developed infrastructure for hosting academic materials generated by their member communities. In December 2013, they announced integration with ImpactStory to support the collection of altmetrics. Figshare made 200,000 files publicly available in its first year, which grew to approximately one million objects by September 2013."
"Figshare also hosts the Reproducibility Collection as a founding member of The Reproducibility Initiative, which acts as an independent and blinded validator for replication of submitted data."
Figshare releases '' each year to assess the changing academic landscape around open research.
"Researchers can upload all of their research outputs to Figshare, thus making them publicly available. Users can upload files in any format, and items are attributed a DOI. The current 'types' that can be chosen are figures, datasets, media (including video), papers (including pre-prints), posters, code, and filesets (groups of files). All files are released under a Creative Commons license, CC-BY for most files and CC0 (public domain) for datasets. Figshare allows researchers to publish negative data. The withholding of negative publications is a widely known phenomenon that leads to a significant bias, often referred to as the file drawer effect. By encouraging publishing of figures, charts, and data, rather than being limited to the traditional entire 'paper', knowledge can be shared more quickly and effectively. Figshare also tracks the download statistics for hosted materials, acting in turn as a source for altmetrics. The main hosting mechanism for the platform is Amazon S3, with CLOCKSS serving as an additional host for public content. Both of these resources support backup and preservation via a distributed cloud computing network."

"The IBM Z family maintains full backward compatibility. In effect, current systems are the direct, lineal descendants of System/360, announced in 1964, and the System/370 from the 1970s. Many applications written for these systems can still run unmodified on the newest IBM Z system over five decades later."
"Virtualization is required by default on IBM Z systems. First layer virtualization is provided by the Processor Resource and System Manager (PR/SM) to deploy one or more Logical Partitions (LPARs). Each LPAR supports a variety of operating systems. A hypervisor called z/VM can also be run as the second layer virtualization in LPARs to create as many virtual machines (VMs) as there are resources assigned to the LPARs to support them. The first layer of IBM Z virtualization (PR/SM) allows a z machine to run a limited number of LPARs (up to 80 on the IBM z13). These can be considered virtual ""bare metal"" servers because PR/SM allows CPUs to be dedicated to individual LPARs. z/VM LPARs allocated within PR/SM LPARs can run a very large number of virtual machines as long as there are adequate CPU, memory, and I/O resources configured with the system for the desired performance, capacity, and throughput."
"IBM Z's PR/SM and hardware attributes allow compute resources to be dynamically changed to meet workload demands. CPU and memory resources can be non-disruptively added to the system and dynamically assigned, recognized, and used by LPARs. I/O resources such as IP and SAN ports can also be added dynamically. They are virtualized and shared across all LPARs. The hardware component that provides this capability is called the Channel Subsystem. Each LPAR can be configured to either ""see"" or ""not see"" the virtualized I/O ports to establish desired ""shareness"" or isolation. This virtualization capability allows significant reduction in I/O resources because of its ability to share them and drive up utilization."
"PR/SM on IBM Z has earned Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 5+ security certification, and z/VM has earned Common Criteria EAL4+ certification."
The KVM hypervisor from Linux has also been ported.
"Since the move away from the System/390 name, a number of IBM Z models have been released. These can be grouped into families with similar architectural characteristics."
"The IBM zEnterprise System (zEnterprise), announced in July 2010, with the z196 model, is designed to offer both mainframe and distributed server technologies in an integrated system. The zEnterprise System consists of three components. First is a System z server. Second is the IBM zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX). Last is the management layer, IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager (zManager), which provides a single management view of zEnterprise resources. The zEnterprise is designed to extend mainframe capabilities – management efficiency, dynamic resource allocation, serviceability – to other systems and workloads running on AIX on POWER7, and Microsoft Windows or Linux on x86."
"The zEnterprise BladeCenter Extension (zBX) is an infrastructure component that hosts both general purpose blade servers and appliance-like workload optimizers which can all be managed as if they were a single mainframe. The zBX supports a private high speed internal network that connects it to the central processing complex, which reduces the need for networking hardware and provides inherently high security."
"The IBM zEnterprise Unified Resource Manager integrates the System z and zBX resources as a single virtualized system and provides unified and integrated management across the zEnterprise System. It can identify system bottlenecks or failures among disparate systems and if a failure occurs it can dynamically reallocate system resources to prevent or reduce application problems. The Unified Resource Manager provides energy monitoring and management, resource management, increased security, virtual networking, and information management from a single user interface."
Highlights of the original zEnterprise z196 include:
"The newest zEnterprise, the EC12, was announced in August 2012, and included:"
"On April 8, 2014, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the System/360 mainframe, IBM announced the release of its first converged infrastructure solution based on mainframe technology.

"The Yeshiva College, also known as the Harry O. Triguboff Centre, is a Hasidic Jewish synagogue, learning centre, and library of the Chabad-Lubavitch nusach, located at 36 Flood Street, in the Sydney suburb of Bondi, New South Wales, Australia. The Centre runs various adult and child-based educational programs."
The centre was established in 1956 by Abraham Rabinovitch and others. The leaders from 1956 to 1968 were Rabbi G. Hertz and Rabbi C. E. Barzel. In 1968 the Yeshiva's board of trustees appointed Rabbi Pinchus Feldman to lead its synagogue and to assist with expanding its small ultra-orthodox Jewish day school.
"Our Big Kitchen, a charity established by Yeshiva Sydney in 2005, operates from the Yeshiva."
"In February 2015 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse heard Rabbi Yossi Feldman testify, where he stated that he ""was not aware it was illegal to touch a child's genitals"". Feldman told the Commission that he did not find it necessary for victims to report sexual abuse to the police if offences took place decades prior. He proposed that the law be lenient on sexual predators who had not committed any sexual abuse for two decades if they had repented. His comments outraged the Australian Jewish community, and victims of sexual harassment called for him to stand down. Rabbi Yossi Feldman stood down from his administrative positions at the Yeshiva Centre."
"Due to their negligent handling of sex abuse in the Centre, survivor advocate, Manny Waks, placed the centre on his wall of shame."
The Royal Commission issued a case study on Yeshiva educational facilities in Sydney and Melbourne. The Commission reported that:
"The Yeshiva Gedolah Rabbinical College, like other Chabad Yeshivot Gedolot, provides education and training to young men seeking ordination as rabbis. Established in 1986 by the Yeshiva Centre, it forms part of the Tomchei Temimim Yeshiva network. Rabbi Boruch Lesches served as its Rosh Yeshiva and Mashpia for almost twenty years. He has since left Sydney, and is currently serving as the rabbi of the Chabad-Lubavitch shul in Monsey, New York, which also contains a Yeshiva that is part of the Tomchei Temimim network."
"The Yeshiva Gedolah was administered by Rabbi Yossi Feldman, a son of the Chabad Emissary for New South Wales, Head Rabbi and spiritual leader for Chabad-Lubavitch, New South Wales, Pinchus Feldman, until February 2015 when, following Rabbi Yossi Feldman's evidence to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies labelled his views repugnant and declared him to be ""unfit to hold any position of authority or leadership in the Jewish community""."
"Yeshiva College was a Jewish day school, established by the Yeshiva Centre in 1956. From 1968 to 2003 it was headed by Rabbi Pinchus Feldman. After financial difficulty, in late 2003 the Feldman family ceded control over the school to philanthropist Meir Moss for 1. The school later rebranded as Kesser Torah. In 2007 the Yeshiva opened a new school called Cheder Chabad Lubavitch, later renamed Yeshiva College Bondi Ltd."

The active ingredient was originally benzocaine, presumably to reduce the sense of taste to reduce eating, later changed in the candy (as reported by ""The New York Times"") to phenylpropanolamine."
"By the mid-1980s, public awareness of the disease AIDS caused problems for the brand due to the phonetic similarity of names and the fact that the disease caused immense weight loss in patients. While initially sales were not affected, by 1988 the chair of Dep Corporation announced that the company was seeking a new name because sales had dropped as much as 50% due to publicity about the disease. While the product's name was changed to Diet Ayds (Aydslim in Britain), it was eventually withdrawn from the market."
The product was introduced by the Carlay Company of Chicago. A U.S. trademark was registered in 1946 claiming first use in commerce was in 1937.
"In 1944, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission objected to the claim that the product could cause the user to ""lose up to 10 pounds in 5 days, without dieting or exercising""."
"The Carlay Company later became a division of Campana Corporation of Batavia, Illinois. Then Campana bought Allied Laboratories of Kansas City in 1956. Thereafter, Campana was bought by Dow Chemical and its president, Irving Willard Crull, was president of Dow for less than six months, during which time he engineered the sale of Campana to Purex in the 1960s. He again become president of Campana while serving as a vice president of Purex, which allowed Campana to function as a separate division. Crull also relied on socialite and Hollywood friends like Bob Hope and his wife Dolores Hope, Tyrone Power and his wife Linda Christian, and others to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan Candy line. A ""Cosmopolitan"" magazine article in November 1956 reported that Crull had already recruited a number of his friends amongst socialite and Hollywood celebrities to promote the Ayds Reducing Plan weight-loss regimen."
"In 1981, Purex sold the rights to the Ayds name to Jeffrey Martin Inc. In 1987, Jeffrey Martin, Inc. and its product line (including Ayds Appetite Suppressant and Compoz Sleep Aid) were acquired by the Dep Corporation (sometimes written DEP)."
= = = Justin King (guitarist) = = =
"Justin King (born June 13, 1979) is an American musician and artist from Eugene, Oregon, recognized as a pioneering guitarist for his percussive ""tapping"" playing style which consists of a variety of influences ranging from Flamenco to Celtic music. Currently, King is running a recording studio in Brooklyn, New York called Vinegar Hill Sound as well as doing part-time war photojournalism in places like Iraq and Afghanistan."
"King comes from a family well known in the wine business under the King Estate name. King attended O'Hara Catholic School from the first grade through the eighth grade. He later attended Marist High School before attending South Eugene High School. He dropped out of high school as a sophomore and entered the San Francisco Art Institute to study painting. He began playing drums and guitar around age 14 and wrote and performed songs with his current bassist, Drew Dresman. King began to focus on acoustic guitar at age 19, and in 1999 he released his self-titled album, followed by ""Opening"" in 2000. In 2001, after traveling through Europe, Ireland and Great Britain, King recorded ""Le Bleu""—an instrumental acoustic guitar record which featured long-time friends and James West on percussion, Troy Sicotte on bass and Linh Renken on violins. Le Bleu was recorded at Peter Gabriel's ""Real World Studios"" just outside Bath, England."
"Inspired by Real World Studios, King returned to the US and began construction on his own studio ""Blackberry Hill"". The studio took about two years to complete during which time King toured the country as a solo guitarist opening for James Taylor, BB King, Diana Krall, North Mississippi All-Stars, Al Green and others. Just after building Blackberry Hill King recorded another instrumental record, ""I-XII"", with James West, renowned bassist Michael Manring and European guitarist Carlos Vamos. Shortly after that King started a band with James West (later replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee), Troy Sicotte (later replaced by Drew Dresman), and Ehren Ebbage (later replaced by Chris Plank). The band toured the country for about one year before being signed to a major label record deal with Epic Records in 2006."
"The band recorded the self-titled ""Justin King and the Apologies"" record at King's Blackberry Hill studio as well as studios in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. The recording process took more than a year during which time the band continued to tour extensively throughout the nation as well as some international performances. After a large shakeup at Epic Records in which the president and the band's A&R representative left the company the band stayed on in limbo with Epic for about one more year before requesting to be let go from the label. Epic gave the master recording rights to the band and the album was released independently by the band shortly thereafter. After touring tirelessly throughout the year the band broke up around the end of 2007."
"Since the disbanding of The Apologies, King has pursued an interest in photojournalism, having spent August 2008 in Iraq embedded with the Oregon National Guard at Balad Air Base. He accompanied the US military on patrols and raids as well as medevac missions and convoys. His photos appeared on the BBC's website and his stories were featured in Oregon's mainstream news publications."
"In 2001, King released ""Le Bleu"", which was a mostly instrumental album featuring only one track with vocals (""Ashes""). It dramatically showcased his skills on acoustic instruments, and although the album was independently released, it would receive critical acclaim. However, the biggest boom to his music career was the release of live videos on the Internet. The first, and most famous, was a clip of the credits from a documentary on Jean Larrivée guitars. In it, King plays an energetic, fast-paced version of ""Phunkdified,"" which served to introduce younger, web-savvy players to King's unique playing style. His live performance of ""Knock on Wood"" at the Hult Center for the Performing Arts in Eugene introduced the Doolin double-neck acoustic guitar."
"Following the release of ""Le Bleu"", King began several new projects including an electronic remix of ""Le Bleu"" by the Raging Family, and another instrumental project with Carlos Vamos and Michael Manring. His primary focus, however, was a songwriting-based album. He assembled a new band with longtime friends Ehren Ebbage (lead guitar) and Drew Desman (bass). In 2005, drummer James West and was replaced by Nadir Jeevanjee. King's endeavor in rock music also features a return to playing piano on several songs. King's latest music maintains his complex musical style despite acquiring a more mainstream sound."
"On March 20, 2007, King and his band, after a long struggle, ended their contract with Sony BMG/Epic Records. The band felt that the label took away a considerable amount of freedom in deciding how the music should sound, as well as showing little interest in King's musical ambitions. The band released a five-song EP, ""Fall/Rise"", in spring 2007 before resuming touring, which included several performances in South Korea. The band's debut album, ""Justin King and The Apologies"", was released on September 28, 2007."
"Critical friend has its origins in critical pedagogy education reforms in the 1970s and arose out of the self-appraisal activity which is attributed to Desmond Nuttall. One of the most widely used definitions is from 1993,"
"Andrew Hutchinson, a public sector consultant, introduced the term to the Local Government Consortium at the University of Warwick in 1998 and it is cited in several papers produced by Professor Jean Hartley of the Local Government Consortium. The critical friend is characterised as falling between the extremes of the ""hostile witness"" and the ""uncritical lover"" whereas earlier texts go so far as to allude to Janus in discussing the concept."
"This dichotomy appealed to Hutchinson who frequently used the term while leader of the South East Midlands Citizen's Charter Quality Network run by the Cabinet Office in Whitehall. In his time running the network he came into regular contact with fellow Lancastrian and Government Minister Peter Kilfoyle MP, Public Service Minister who was responsible for the running of the networks as minister. When Kilfoyle found himself increasingly distanced from the policy agenda of Prime Minister Tony Blair and he chose to resign from Government, Hansard quotes him as saying that he wished to return to the back benches but remain a ""critical friend"" of the Government."
"He was misquoted in the ""Daily Telegraph"" as they claimed that he had said that he wished to be a ""candid friend"" to Government. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the term critical friend has its origins in the softer sounding notion of the candid friend. Nonetheless following the resignation of Peter Kilfoyle ""The Guardian"" newspaper (a popular publication amongst the intelligentsia and public sector middle management) began to popularise the term which is increasingly entering into general usage. The phrase is still most commonly used in education circles but its wider use in the public sector can to a large part be attributed to Andrew Hutchinson and his natural enthusiasm for the concept, being described as 'a natural critical friend acting with positive intent' in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Coventry City Council, Iain Roxburgh, who is now Director of the Warwick Research Consortium. While a variety of useful and interesting quotations are to be found on the web perhaps the reason for the popularity of the phrase is best summed up by the following quotation,"
= = = Tamil historical novels = = =
Tamil historical novels are a genre of Tamil literature that began to appear in the mid-19th century.
"Prathaapa Mudaliaar Charithram (""The Life of Prathaapa Mudaliaar""), written in 1857 and published in 1879, was the first novel in the Tamil language. The novel does not involve historical characters or events but is set in royal times. Penned by Maayuram Vedanaayakam Pillai, it was a landmark in Tamil literature, which had hitherto seen writings only in poetry. The book gave birth to a new literary genre and Tamil prose began to be recognized as an increasingly important part of the language. One can see the style of any Tamil author in this novel."
"Aabathukidamaana Apavaadham -or- Kamalaambaal Charithram is written by Rajam Iyer from Vathalakundu in the later part of the 19th century is the first Tamil novel depicting the life of living people. The author worked in Tamil daily Dinamani; he live just 26 years. Considering the period in which he lived and wrote, he created waves in emancipation of women's life, incomparable to any social reformist. In this story he conducted marriage to a Brahmin widow. Had he lived further and wrote more, the style of modern Tamil prose would have been different."
"Authors like Kalki Krishnamurthy, Akilan wrote historical novels during the Indian independence movement to instil patriotic pride in the people. Most historical novels were serialised in Tamil magazines before being published in book form. The advent of netzines has seen new web based historical writers entering the arena."
"= = = Bateman, Saskatchewan = = ="
"Bateman is an organized hamlet in the southwest region of Saskatchewan, Canada, north of the Red Coat Trail. It was named after Jim Bateman, the first settler to come to the area with his family in 1908."
"Bateman was once a prosperous community, which had a peak population of more than 300 citizens in the late 1920s. In 2000, the last resident left, and many of the remaining buildings were torn down by the government of Saskatchewan."
"Upon arrival in 1908, Jim Bateman took possession of a quarter section of land on the banks of Notukeu Creek. Then in 1911, Bateman would open a post office. His daughter Lydia was sworn in as the post mistress and drove up to St. Boswells, northwest of Bateman with her father to pick up the community's first mail bag."
"During its pioneer and times of great prosperity, Bateman would have over 300 residents during the late 1920s. Bateman was also a focal point for small family grain farmers in the region. The community once boasted four grain elevators, a bank, a theatre, restaurants, two gas stations, two churches, three grocery stores, skating and curling rink, and two implement businesses. The community even had its own power plant and street light system."
"Bateman once had a school that covered grades K–12, but closed due to the consolidation of schools. In 1966, Bateman lost its grade 12 classes, and a few years after that the school would again lose grades 10 and 11, to the neighbouring town of Gravelbourg, leaving only grade nine for the high-school level, eventually being moved there as well, leaving just the elementary classes. In 1996, Bateman's school finally closed for good."
Today the once impressive brick school has been demolished due to the poor condition the building was in. All that remains of the former school is the foundation and a commemorative sign.

"The video clip for the song was one of the first ever videos screened on MTV. In a documentary for Radio New Zealand, Neil Finn expressed surprise at the song's success, stating that it ""hasn't got a proper chorus""."
"After Split Enz's dissolution in 1984, singer Neil Finn continued to perform ""One Step Ahead"" with his next group Crowded House, in particular, the group performed the song live at their 1987 concert in Daytona known as ""Spring Break '87""."

= = = Eight-legged essay = = =
"The eight-legged essay (, literally ""eight share text"") was a style of essay that exam-takers wrote to pass the imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties in China. The eight-legged essay was needed for those test takers in these civil service tests to show their merits for government service, often focusing on Confucian thought and knowledge of the Four Books and Five Classics, in relation to governmental ideals. Test takers could not write in innovative or creative ways, but needed to conform to the standards of the eight-legged essay. Various skills were examined, including the ability to write coherently and to display basic logic. In certain times, the candidates were expected to spontaneously compose poetry upon a set theme, whose value was also sometimes questioned, or eliminated as part of the test material. This was a major argument in favor of the eight-legged essay, arguing that it were better to eliminate creative art in favor of prosaic literacy. In the history of Chinese literature, the eight-legged essay is often said to have caused China's ""cultural stagnation and economic backwardness"" in the 19th century."
"The eight-legged essay is named so because it was divided into eight sections, which are ""breaking open the topic (破题)"", ""receiving the topic (承题)"", ""beginning discussion (起讲)"", ""initial leg (起股)"", ""middle leg (中股)“, ""later leg (后股)"", ""final leg (束股), ""conclusion (大结)."""
"The eight-legged essay format was invented in the Song Dynasty, by reformer and poet Wang Anshi (1021–1086), in the eleventh century. During the Song Dynasty, due to the invention of the printing press and the emperors' wish to recruit more men of talent, there was a huge boost in education and a consequent increase in the number of people taking the civil service exam. Additionally, there was a shift from a pluralistic ideology characteristic of the Tang Dynasty to a neo-Confucian ideology based on Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi's philosophy. The eight-legged essay came into existence under this background, coinciding with the shift in ideology and embodying the new orthodoxy."
"The essay format didn't become prevalent as a standard essay in the civil service examination until early Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the composition of the essay was clearly specified. In the seventeenth century, Gu Yanwu stated that this form of essay-writing became standardized precisely during the 15th century, when the eight parts of the essay were determined. The term ""eight-legged essay"" formally appeared during the early years of the Chenghua Emperor's reign (1464–1487) for the first time. Then, it started to be required in civil service examinations in the 1480s."
"Since mastery of the form was a requirement for success in the examinations, commercial printers during the Ming Dynasty began to print successful examination essays as guides for aspiring candidates. The first of these appeared in pirated form during the 16th century, and the practice gained official approval in 1587, when the government suggested that the best papers of the previous century be reprinted as examples."
"There was widespread dissatisfaction with the eight-legged essay during the Qing Dynasty. In the beginning of the Kangxi reign, the state under the rule of the Four Regents issued an order revoking the need to use ""baguwen"" in all civil service exams, although the order was later repealed. The Qianlong Emperor said that he could not comprehend the eight-legged essays written by many exam-takers. The eight-legged essay was abolished in 1905 by the Guangxu Emperor. In total, the eight-legged essay was included in China's civil service examination for over 1,000 years and thus assumed a historically important role."
"Structurally and stylistically, the eight-legged essay was restrictive and rigid. There are rules governing different sections of the essay, including restrictions on the number of sentences in total, the number of words in total, the format and structure of the essay, and rhyming techniques. The requirement of length went from 550 words to 700 at one point."
"In terms of the content, the exam-takers were required to compose their essays under a pre-assigned title and rhyming word, around which they needed to rhyme their essays or poems. Writers were also advised to circumvent the use of offensive vocabulary and clues that can point to their identity or social status."
"The components of the essay were usually in a consistent format, although there were variations; in particular:"
"The following is a translation of an original eight-legged essay, written by Wang Ao (1450–1524), who was considered to be a master of the form."

"The octahemioctacron is the dual of the octahemioctahedron, and is one of nine dual hemipolyhedra. It appears visually indistinct from the hexahemioctacron."
"Since the hemipolyhedra have faces passing through the center, the dual figures have corresponding vertices at infinity; properly, on the real projective plane at infinity. In Magnus Wenninger's ""Dual Models"", they are represented with intersecting prisms, each extending in both directions to the same vertex at infinity, in order to maintain symmetry. In practice the model prisms are cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation figures, called ""stellation to infinity"". However, he also suggested that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions."
The octahemioctacron has four vertices at infinity.
= = = Crambe abyssinica = = =
Crambe abyssinica is an annual oilseed crop of the family Brassicaceae. It is mainly cultivated due to the high levels of erucic acid that are contained in its seeds. The crambe oil is used for industrial purposes and its side products can be partly used as animal feed.
"""C. abyssinica"" has its origins in eastern Africa and was domesticated in the Mediterranean region. It grows up to a height between 0.5 and 2m, depending on field conditions. Its cropping cycle is rather short, ranging from 90 to 100 days. Usually, its straight stalk is moderately branched and its leaves are of an oval shape. The plant’s flowers are small and white, arranged in racemes and have four free sepals, four free alternating petals, two shorter and four longer free stamens, what is typical for Brassicaceae. Mostly, these flowers are self-pollinated, but some cases of cross-pollination have been observed. Its indehiscent fruits enclose only one spherical seed that contains around 26% protein, 18% fibre and 35% oil. This oil content is lower than what can be extracted from rapeseed and the oil is not edible. The pericarp of the seed usually adheres to the seed even at harvest."
"Crambe has not been in cultivation for a long time. It was probably cultivated for the first time in the 1930s in the former USSR. Later the crop was tested in other regions of the USSR, in Sweden and in Poland, where crambe was grown on 25’000 ha after the second world war. Research efforts in northern and eastern Europe were increased and the agronomical characteristics and industrial uses of crambe were intensively studied. By successive selection within ""C. abyssinica,"" conventional breeding started in the 1950s in some European countries. Hereby improved strains were introduced to Canada and the United States. Further selection and crossing of different accession led to the release of new varieties in the 1970s. Through introgression of wild populations and mass selection two new cultivars were created in the 1980s which were promoted as high yielding source of erucic acid. In the 1990s a breeding program was started in the Netherlands. Nevertheless, after a period of great efforts to bring crambe into extended cultivation, interest in the crop in Europe has declined in recent years ."
"With a germination temperature of 6 °C which is also equivalent to the basal growing temperature, ""C. abyssinica"" is a winter crop in southern Europe and subtropical areas whereas it is cultivated as spring crop in northern Europe and more continental areas. The optimal growing temperature is approximately 15 °C. It tolerates annual average temperature between 5.7 and 16.2 °C and frost down to -6 °C. Because of its ability to get along with only 350mm of precipitation, ""C. abyssinica"" is considered to be relatively drought tolerant. Nevertheless, drought stress during the development stages of flowering and grain filling reduces productivity. Cultivation is possible up to an annual precipitation of 1200mm. Crambe has modest demands regarding soil properties, it tolerates soil pH from 5.0 to 7.8. Low soil depth and a high stone and gravel content decrease drought tolerance."
"Seeds of many improved varieties are available on the market and are sown at a rate of approximately 120 seeds per m and at a depth of 5-15mm. Seed maturation is uniform and the 1000 seed weight varies between 6.0 and 7.5g. Management procedures from sowing to harvesting can be conducted largely with the same machinery used for common cereals. Yield levels vary widely between 1100-1600kgha in Russia, 450-2500kgha in the U.S. and 600-2400kgha in Germany."
"""C. abyssinica"" can be easily inserted in crop rotations with a requirement of 1600 growing degree-days. Its rotation contingent should not exceed 25%. Because of similar soil requirements and increased soil borne pathogen pressure, cultivation directly after other Brassicaceae species should be avoided as well as cultivation after artificial grassland and fallows due to an enriched soil seed bank of potential weeds and regarding the limited pre-emergence weed management methods."
"""C. abyssinica"" is cultivated for a wide range of industrial purposes. The interest lies mainly in the high erucic acid content (55-60%) of its seed oil and makes the crop a competitive option to other oil plants as industrial rapeseed. The composition of crambe oil gives this product several special traits, such as high smoke point, good wettability of different materials and high viscosity. In addition, its oil has a higher biodegradability than mineral oils. Therefore, erucic acid derived compounds are used as additives in the plastic industry, high temperature hydraulic fluids, waxes, base for paints and coatings, lubricants and many other products. Furthermore, the extracted seed oil is used in pharmaceutical products and cosmetics."
"The crambe meal, which is a side product of industrial oil production, can be used as a protein supplement for animal feed. It contains approximately 46% proteins, which are of high nutritional quality. Unfortunately, the crambe seed shred also contains toxic compounds as glucosinolates, tannins and inositol phosphate. The use as forage is therefore very limited. The incorporation rate of crambe by-products into animal feed should not be higher than 5% for growing-finishing pigs, 15% for dairy cows, and 19% for sheep. It is not recommended to feed poultry."
"Thallium(I) hydroxide, also called thallous hydroxide, TlOH, is a hydroxide of thallium, with thallium in oxidation state +1. Thallous hydroxide is a strong base; it is changed to thallous ion, Tl, except in strongly basic conditions. Tl resembles an alkali metal ion, A, such as Li or K."
= = = Abram Petrovich Gannibal = = =
"Abram Petrovich Gannibal, also Hannibal or Ganibal, or Abram Hannibal or Abram Petrov (; 1696 – 14 May 1781), was a Russian military engineer, general, and nobleman of African origin. Kidnapped as a child, Gannibal was taken to Russia and presented as a gift to Peter the Great, where he was freed, adopted and raised in the Emperor's court household as his godson."
"Gannibal eventually rose to become a prominent member of the imperial court in the reign of Peter's daughter Elizabeth. He had 11 children, most of whom became members of the Russian nobility; he was a great-grandfather of the author and poet Alexander Pushkin."
"The main reliable accounts of Gannibal's life come from ""The Moor of Peter the Great,"" Pushkin's unfinished biography of his great-grandfather, published after Pushkin's death in 1837. Scholars argue that Pushkin's account may be inaccurate due to the author’s desire to elevate the status of his ancestors and family. There are a number of contradictions between the biographies of Pushkin and the German novel, ""The Blackamoor of Peter the Great"" based on his great-grandfather. A historical biography by Gannibal's son-in-law, Rotkirkh, was largely responsible for the myth, propagated by some historians, that Gannibal was born in Ethiopia. However, more recent research by the scholars Dieudonné Gnammankou and Hugh Barnes has established that the general was instead likely born in Central Africa, in an area bordering Lake Chad in present-day Cameroon."
"Richard Pankhurst, the former professor at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies at the University of Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, believed the young Abram, Ibrahim or Abraham, as he named him, was born around 1698. He was the son of a minor ""prince"" or chief whose capital was Logon (now part of present-day Cameroon). His father was relatively affluent taking several wives and having 19 children. However, after his father died in battle trying to defend his territory from the Ottoman Turks, Abram was abducted and taken to Constantinople by ship. His sister, Lagan, is said to have drowned in the sea in a desperate attempt to save her brother."
"Abram stayed in the Ottoman Empire for about a year in the service of Sultan Ahmed III's household. At the time, the Russian ambassador Sava Vladislavich-Raguzinsky, representing Peter the Great, was looking for ""a few clever little African slaves"" for the Tsar's palace in Moscow, as was the custom in those days at the great courts in Europe. On orders of Vladislavich's superiors (one of whom was Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy, great-grandfather of the celebrated writer Leo Tolstoy), Abram was selected for this purpose and soon ransomed from the Sultan's viziers with a bribe. In 1704, the ambassador immediately dispatched him by land to Moscow in order to be presented to Tsar Peter the Great."
"The Tsar is noted to have taken a liking to the boy’s intelligence and potential for military service, and brought the child into his household."
"Abram was baptized in 1705, in St. Paraskeva Church in Vilnius, with Peter as his godfather. The date of Gannibal’s baptism held personal significance; he used that date as his birthday because he did not know his actual date of birth."
"Abram valued his relationship with his godfather, as well as that of Peter's daughter (Elizabeth), and was loyal to them as if they were family."
"Starting at a young age, the boy Abram would travel alongside the emperor during his military campaigns, and at these military journeys he served as his godfather’s valet."
"In 1717, Abram was sent to Metz to receive an education in the arts, sciences and warfare from the highest institutes available. By then he was fluent in several languages and excelled in mathematics and geometry. In 1718 Abram joined the French Army with hopes of pleasing his godfather by expanding his learning in military engineering. He enrolled in the royal artillery academy at La Fère in 1720."
"During Abram's studies, conflict broke out between France and Spain, and he fought for France in the War of the Quadruple Alliance, rising to the rank of captain. While fighting in the French war against Spain, Abram received a head injury and was captured by the Spanish army. He was released in 1722 and continued his studies in Metz."
"It was during his time in France that Abram adopted the surname ""Gannibal"" in honor of the Carthaginian general Hannibal (""Gannibal"" being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian). In Paris he met and befriended such Enlightenment figures as the Baron de Montesquieu and Voltaire (this claim by his biographer Hugh Barnes is disputed by reviewer Andrew Kahn). Voltaire called Gannibal the ""dark star of the Enlightenment""."
"Gannibal returned to Russia the following year, and his advanced training enabled him to apply and successfully acquire posts first as an engineer and then as a mathematics tutor for one of the Tsar's private guard units."
"Gannibal's education was completed by 1723, and he was due to return to Russia. After the death of Peter in 1725, Prince Menshikov gained power in Russia due to his good standing with Peter. However, Menshikov was not fond of Gannibal and was suspicious of his foreign origins and superior education. Gannibal was exiled to Siberia in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of Saint Petersburg. He was pardoned in 1730 due to his technical skills, and completed his service in Siberia in 1733. During this time he built a fortress and led several construction projects, where he became a master engineer."
"Elizabeth of Russia became the new monarch in 1741. Gannibal became a prominent member of her court, rose to the rank of major-general, and became superintendent of Reval (now Tallinn, Estonia), a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on 22 March 1744 by ""A. Ganibal"" is held at the Tallinn City Archives. In 1742, the Empress Elizabeth gave him the Mikhailovskoye estate in Pskov Oblast with hundreds of serfs. He retired to this estate in 1762."
"In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to Empress Elizabeth, while petitioning for the rank of nobility and a coat of arms, he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an elephant and the mysterious word ""FVMMO"", which may mean ""homeland"" in the Kotoko language. In his book, ""Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg"", Hugh Barnes writes of meeting with the sultan of Logone-Birni, who gave him the same translation of the word. However, Frances Somers-Cocks, author of ""The Moor of St Petersburg: In the Footsteps of a Black Russian"", met the same sultan and received a different translation for FVMMO. She also suggested that FVMMO stands for the Latin expression ""Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Omnino"" which means ""Fortune has changed my life entirely."""
"Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a Greek woman. The couple married in 1731. Dioper despised her husband, whom she was forced to marry. The marriage between Dioper and Gannibal was very volatile, and he suspected her of infidelity early in their marriage. Gannibal’s suspicions were confirmed when Dioper gave birth to a white daughter. When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years."
"Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Siöberg (1705–1781), daughter of Mattias Johan Siöberg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her bigamously in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while he was still lawfully married to his first wife. His divorce from Dioper did not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a convent for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed lawful after his divorce. Gannibal’s second marriage to Christina was much happier, and he appreciated her fidelity and affection towards him."
"On her paternal side, Gannibal’s second wife was descended from noble families in Scandinavia and Germany: Siöberg (Sweden), Galtung (Norway), and Grabow (Denmark) / von Grabow (Brandenburg). Her paternal grandfather was Gustaf Siöberg, Rittmester til Estrup, who died in 1694, whose wife Clara Maria Lauritzdatter Galtung (ca. 1651–1698) was the daughter of Lauritz Lauritzson Galtung (ca. 1615–1661) and of Barbara Grabow til Pederstrup (1631–1696)."
"Abram Gannibal and Christine Regina Siöberg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of Alexander Pushkin. Gannibal's oldest son, Ivan, became an accomplished naval officer who helped found the city of Kherson in 1779 and attained the rank of general-in-chief, the second-highest military rank in imperial Russia."
"Some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, including Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster and her sister, Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn. George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven, a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II, is also a direct descendant, as the grandson of Nadejda Mountbatten, Marchioness of Milford Haven."
"Gannibal's actual place of birth continues to be uncertain, and is subject to speculation by modern historians. Until recent scholarly field work, it was generally assumed that he originated in Ethiopia. Chiefly Russian scholars for many years believed that he was from the vicinity of Medri Bahri, an ancient kingdom in present-day Eritrea. In a letter he wrote to Empress Elizabeth, Peter the Great's daughter, Gannibal stated that he was from the town of ""Logon"" or ""Lagone"". Anthropologist Dmitry Anuchin wrote an essay about Alexander Pushkin in which he theorized that ""Lagone"" referred to Logo-chewa in Eritrea. In 1999, the Russian Institute in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, also campaigned for a commemorative stamp to honor Pushkin's bicentennial."
"The governments of Ethiopia and Eritrea each claim that Gannibal was born in their respective territories. Under this belief, the Ethiopian government named a street in Addis Ababa after Alexander Pushkin, Gannibal's great-grandson. It also placed a bust of him near the African Union headquarters in 2002, and arranged for a statue of Pushkin to be transferred from Moscow to Addis Ababa in 2014. However, the notion that Gannibal may have been born in Ethiopia holds little currency with the general Ethiopian population. The Eritrean government asserts that Gannibal was instead born in Loggo Sarda, an area in modern Eritrea. It also erected its own statue of Pushkin and named a street for him in 2009."
"Vladimir Nabokov cast doubt on Gannibal's ancestry, based on research findings during his work translating Pushkin's novel ""Eugene Onegin"". Nabokov disagreed with Anuchin's theory, stating that it was just as likely that Gannibal was referring to ""the Lagona region of equatorial Africa, south of Lake Chad."" Support for Anuchin's theory of Ethiopian birth declined after it was exposed as racially based, implying that ""hamitic"" Ethiopian origins better explained Gannibal's success than ""negroid"" origins."
"The Beninean historian Dieudonné Gnammankou, an expert on Russia, studied Russian, French and African sources and argued that Gannibal was indeed from Logone-Birni and was most likely the son of a chief in the ancient sultanate. In 1995, Gnammankou asserted that the ""Logon"" Gannibal wrote about was actually Logone, capital of the old Kotoko kingdom of Logone-Birni, now located in northern Cameroon. He believed that the pattern of slave trade around Lake Chad made that region a more plausible likelihood for Gannibal's birthplace than Gondar, Ethiopia. Gnammankou's biography of Gannibal was translated into Russian, and was voted the best book on Pushkin at the 1999 Moscow Book Fair."
"Gnammankou's findings were in turn buttressed by the field work of Hugh Barnes. After consulting with the Sultan of Logone-Birni, Barnes found that an inscription on Gannibal's crest, which was hitherto undecipherable, corresponded with the term for ""homeland"" in the local Kotoko language of central Africa."
"In November, 2010, representatives from Russia and Estonia, the ambassador of Cameroon, and the sultan of Logone-Birni went to La Fère, France to unveil a commemorative plaque honoring Abram Petrovich Gannibal as a graduate of La Fère's royal artillery academy. The academy, which closed in the 1990s, had been started by King Louis XV shortly before Gannibal's enrollment there in 1720. The plaque declares that he was a graduate of the royal artillery academy of La Fère, and later became chief military engineer and general-in-chief of the Imperial Russian Army. It also notes that Gannibal is the great-grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's greatest poet. Dieudonné Gnammankou, whose research into Gannibal's background was largely responsible for the ceremony at La Fère taking place, also served as the main speaker at a symposium following the event."

"= = = Kingston, California = = ="
"Kingston is a former town that is no longer in existence. Originally in Fresno County, until 1909 when Fresno County lands in the vicinity, south of Kings river were transferred to Kings County, California. It was located on the south bank of the Kings River northwest of Hanford at Whitmore's Ferry."
"L. A. Whitmore established the ferry in 1854. It was founded in 1856 by Lucious A. Whitmore who operated the first ferry to cross the Kings River. The town of Kingston grew up around the ferry at the place where an old Spanish road called ""El Camino Viejo á Los Angeles"" (The Old Road to Los Angeles) crossed the river. Kingston became a stopping place on the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861 and a stage route between Stockton and Visalia after 1858. A post office operated at Kingston from 1859 to 1862, and from 1866 to 1890, when the service transferred to Lillis. Until at least 1872, the only store between Millerton and Visalia was in Kingston. The first school in the area was probably the one established as early as 1860 in Kingston."
"Oliver H. Bliss operated the Kingston ferry after Whitmore, beginning in 1859. Bliss built a temporary toll bridge with two boats and planking in 1872. In 1873, John Sutherland purchased Bliss's interest in both the ferry and the bridge and built a permanent bridge that year."
"On December 26, 1873, Tiburcio Vásquez and his bandit gang made a bold raid, robbing the entire village. Reportedly 35 or more men were tied up and over $2,000 in loot was hauled away. Subsequently, the town declined and by the 1890s Kingston was abandoned. Oliver Bliss' livery stable was the last remaining building and stood until 1930."
"The site of the town is now a California Historical Landmark (#270), which can be found in Kingston-Laton County Park in Kings County."
= = = Voluntary euthanasia = = =
Voluntary euthanasia is the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Voluntary euthanasia (VE) and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been the focus of great controversy in recent years.
"Some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Canada."
"Voluntary refusal of food and fluids (VRFF) (also called voluntarily stopping eating and drinking, or VSED) or Patient Refusal of Nutrition and Hydration (PRNH) is bordering on euthanasia. Some authors classify it as a form of passive euthanasia, while others treat it separately because it is treated differently from legal point of view and often perceived as a more ethical option. VRFF is sometimes suggested as a legal alternative to euthanasia in jurisdictions disallowing euthanasia."
"Assisted suicide is a practice in which a person receives assistance in bringing about their death, typically people suffering from a severe physical illness, in which the final step in the process is actively performed by the person concerned. In physician-assisted suicide (also called physician aid-in-dying or PAD) a physician knowingly provides a competent but suffering patient, upon the patient's request, with the means by which the patient intends to end his or her own life. Assisted suicide is contrasted with ""active euthanasia"" when the difference between providing the means and actively administering lethal medicine is considered important. For example, Swiss law allows assisted suicide while all forms of active euthanasia (like lethal injection) remain prohibited."
"The term euthanasia comes from the Greek words ""eu""-meaning good and ""thanatos""-meaning death, which combined means “well-death” or ""dying well"". Hippocrates mentions euthanasia in the Hippocratic Oath, which was written between 400 and 300 BC The original Oath states: “To please no one will I prescribe a deadly drug nor give advice which may cause his death.” Despite this, the ancient Greeks and Romans generally did not believe that life needed to be preserved at any cost and were, in consequence, tolerant of suicide in cases where no relief could be offered to the dying or, in the case of the Stoics and Epicureans, where a person no longer cared for his life."
"English Common Law from the 14th century until the middle of the last century made suicide a criminal act in England and Wales. Assisting others to kill themselves remains illegal in that jurisdiction. However, in the 16th century, Thomas More, considered a saint by Roman Catholics, described a utopian community and envisaged such a community as one that would facilitate the death of those whose lives had become burdensome as a result of ""torturing and lingering pain"", see The meaning of the work."
"Since the 19th century, euthanasia has sparked intermittent debates and activism in Europe and the Americas. According to medical historian Ezekiel Emanuel, it was the availability of anesthesia that ushered in the modern era of euthanasia. In 1828, the first known anti-euthanasia law in the United States was passed in the state of New York, with many other localities and states following suit over a period of several years. After the Civil War, voluntary euthanasia was promoted by advocates, including some doctors. Support peaked around the start of the 20th century in the US and then grew again in the 1930s."
"In an article in the ""Bulletin of the History of Medicine"", Brown University historian Jacob M. Appel documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted suicide in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. Appel indicates social activist Anna Sophina Hall, a wealthy heiress who had watched her mother die after an extended battle with liver cancer, was the driving force behind this movement. According to historian Ian Dowbiggin, leading public figures, including Clarence Darrow and Jack London, advocated for the legalization of euthanasia."
"In 1937, doctor-assisted euthanasia was declared legal in Switzerland as long as the doctor ending the life had nothing to gain. During this same era, US courts tackled cases involving critically ill people who requested physician assistance in dying as well as ""mercy killings,"" such as by parents of their severely disabled children."
"During the post-war period, prominent proponents of euthanasia included Glanville Williams (""The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law"") and clergyman Joseph Fletcher (""Morals and medicine""). By the 1960s, advocacy for a right-to-die approach to voluntary euthanasia increased."
"In 1996, the world's first euthanasia legislation, the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1996, was passed in the Northern Territory of Australia. Four patients died through assisted suicide under the Act, using a device designed by Dr Philip Nitschke. The legislation was overturned by Australia’s Federal Parliament in 1997. In response to the overturning of the Act, Nitschke founded EXIT International. In 2009, an Australian quadriplegic was granted the right to refuse sustenance and be allowed to die. The Supreme Court of Western Australia ruled that it was up to Christian Rossiter, aged 49, to decide if he was to continue to receive medical care (tube feeding) and that his carers had to abide by his wishes. Chief Justice Wayne Martin also stipulated that his carers, Brightwater Care, would not be held criminally responsible for following his instructions. Rossiter died on 21 September 2009 following a chest infection."
"On 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that ""the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient"" and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia ""in the shortest time possible""."
"On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminated ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death."
"In 1957 in Britain, Judge Devlin ruled in the trial of Dr John Bodkin Adams that causing death through the administration of lethal drugs to a patient, if the intention is solely to alleviate pain, is not considered murder even if death is a potential or even likely outcome. In 1993, the Netherlands decriminalized doctor-assisted suicide, and in 2002, restrictions were loosened. During that year, physician-assisted suicide was approved in Belgium. Belgium's at the time most famous author Hugo Claus, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, was among those that asked for euthanasia. He died in March 2008, assisted by an Antwerp doctor."
"A key turning point in the debate over voluntary euthanasia (and physician assisted dying), at least in the United States, was the public furor over the Karen Ann Quinlan case. The Quinlan case paved the way for legal protection of voluntary passive euthanasia. In 1977, California legalized living wills and other states soon followed suit."
"In 1980 the Hemlock Society USA was founded in Santa Monica by Derek Humphry. It was the first group in the United States to provide information to the terminally ill in case they wanted a hastened death. Hemlock also campaigned and partially financed drives to reform the law. In 2003 Hemlock was merged with End of Life Choices, which changed its name to Compassion and Choices."
"In 1990, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, a Michigan physician, became famous for educating and assisting people in committing physician-assisted suicide, which resulted in a Michigan law against the practice in 1992. Kevorkian was tried and convicted in 1999 for a murder displayed on television. Also in 1990, the Supreme Court approved the use of non-active euthanasia."
"In 1994, Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity Act, permitting doctors to assist terminal patients with six months or less to live to end their lives. The U.S. Supreme Court allowed such laws in 1997. The Bush administration failed in its attempt to use drug law to stop Oregon in 2001, in the case ""Gonzales v. Oregon""."
"In 2005, amid U.S. government roadblocks and controversy, Terri Schiavo, a Floridian who had been in a vegetative state since 1990, had her feeding tube removed. Her husband had won the right to take her off life support, which he claimed she would want but was difficult to confirm as she had no living will and the rest of her family claimed otherwise."
"In November 2008, Washington Initiative 1000 made Washington the second U.S. state to legalize physician-assisted suicide."
"In 1960s, John Walden, who was the first one to report the site, collected stone adzes and geometric pottery sherds at the shoreline and the southern slope of Yuen Chau Tsai. In the 1980s and 1990s, field investigations recovered prehistoric cultural remains from the site."
= = = Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase = = =
"Succinyl coenzyme A synthetase (SCS, also known as succinyl-CoA synthetase or succinate thiokinase or succinate-CoA ligase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible reaction of succinyl-CoA to succinate. The enzyme facilitates the coupling of this reaction to the formation of a nucleoside triphosphate molecule (either GTP or ATP) from an inorganic phosphate molecule and a nucleoside diphosphate molecule (either GDP or ADP). It plays a key role as one of the catalysts involved in the citric acid cycle, a central pathway in cellular metabolism, and it is located within the mitochondrial matrix of a cell."
Succinyl CoA synthetase catalyzes the following reversible reaction:
"where Pi denotes inorganic phosphate, NDP denotes nucleoside diphosphate (either GDP or ADP), and NTP denotes nucleoside triphosphate (either GTP or ATP). As mentioned, the enzyme facilitates coupling of the conversion of succinyl CoA to succinate with the formation of NTP from NDP and Pi. The reaction has a biochemical standard state free energy change of -3.4 kJ/mol. The reaction takes place by a three-step mechanism which is depicted in the image below. The first step involves displacement of CoA from succinyl CoA by a nucleophilic inorganic phosphate molecule to form succinyl phosphate. The enzyme then utilizes a histidine residue to remove the phosphate group from succinyl phosphate and generate succinate. Finally, the phosphorylated histidine transfers the phosphate group to a nucleoside diphosphate, which generates the high-energy carrying nucleoside triphosphate."
"Bacterial and mammalian SCSs are made up of α and β subunits. In ""E. coli"" two αβ heterodimers link together to form an αβ heterotetrameric structure. However, mammalian mitochondrial SCSs are active as αβ dimers and do not form a heterotetramer."
"The ""E. coli"" SCS heterotetramer has been crystallized and characterized in great detail. As can be seen in Image 2, the two α subunits (pink and green) reside on opposite sides of the structure and the two β subunits (yellow and blue) interact in the middle region of the protein. The two α subunits only interact with a single β unit, whereas the β units interact with a single α unit (to form the αβ dimer) and the β subunit of the other αβ dimer. A short amino acid chain links the two β subunits which gives rise to the tetrameric structure."
"The crystal structure of Succinyl-CoA synthetase alpha subunit (succinyl-CoA-binding isoform) was determined by Joyce et al. to a resolution of 2.10 A, with PDB code 1CQJ. ."
"Crystal structures for the ""E. coli"" SCS provide evidence that the coenzyme A binds within each α-subunit (within a Rossmann fold) in close proximity to a histidine residue (His246α). This histidine residue becomes phosphorylated during the succinate forming step in the reaction mechanism. The exact binding location of succinate is not well-defined. The formation of the nucleoside triphosphate occurs in an ATP grasp domain, which is located near the N-terminus of the each β subunit. However, this grasp domain is located about 35 Å away from the phosphorylated histidine residue. This leads researchers to believe that the enzyme must undergo a major change in conformation to bring the histidine to the grasp domain and facilitate the formation of the nucleoside triphosphate. Mutagenesis experiments have determined that two glutamate residues (one near the catalytic histidine, Glu208α and one near the ATP grasp domain, Glu197β) play a role in the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the histidine, but the exact mechanism by which the enzyme changes conformation is not fully understood."
"Johnson et al. describe two isoforms of succinyl-CoA synthetase in mammals, one that specifies synthesis of ADP, and one that synthesises GDP."
"In mammals, the enzyme is a heterodimer of an α- and a β-subunit. The specificity for either adenosine or guanosine phosphates is defined by the β-subunit, which is encoded by 2 genes. SUCLG2 is GTP-specific and SUCLA2 is ATP-specific, while SUCLG1 encodes the common α-subunit. β variants are produced at different amounts in different tissues, causing GTP or ATP substrate requirements."
"Mostly consuming tissues such as heart and brain have more ATP-specific succinyl-CoA synthetase (ATPSCS), while synthetic tissues such as kidney and liver have the more GTP-specific form (GTPSCS). Kinetics analysis of ATPSCS from the breast muscle of pigeons and GTPSCS from pigeon liver showed that their apparent Michaelis constants were similar for CoA, but different for the nucleotides, phosphate, and succinate. The largest difference was for succinate: Kapp of ATPSCS = 5mM versus that of GTPSCS = 0.5mM."
"SCS is the only enzyme in the citric acid cycle that catalyzes a reaction in which a nucleoside triphosphate (GTP or ATP) is formed by substrate-level phosphorylation. Research studies have shown that ""E. coli"" SCSs can catalyze either GTP or ATP formation. However, mammals possess different types of SCSs that are specific for either GTP (G-SCS) or ATP (A-SCS) and are native to different types of tissue within the organism. An interesting study using pigeon cells showed that GTP specific SCSs were located in pigeon liver cells, and ATP specific SCSs were located in the pigeon breast muscle cells. Further research revealed a similar phenomenon of GTP and ATP specific SCSs in rat, mouse, and human tissue. It appears that tissue typically involved in anabolic metabolism (like the liver and kidneys) express G-SCS, whereas tissue involved in catabolic metabolism (like the brain, the heart, and muscular tissue) express A-SCS."
"SCS facilitates the flux of molecules into other metabolic pathways by controlling the interconversion between succinyl CoA and succinate. This is important because succinyl CoA is an intermediate necessary for porphyrin, heme, and ketone body biosynthesis."
"In some bacteria, the enzyme is regulated at the transcriptional level. It has been demonstrated that the gene for SCS (sucCD) is transcribed along with the gene for α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (sucAB) under the control of a promoter called sdhC, which is part of the succinate dehydrogenase operon. This operon is up-regulated by the presence of oxygen and responds to a variety of carbon sources. Antibacterial drugs that prevent phosphorylation of histidine, like the molecule LY26650, are potent inhibitors of bacterial SCSs."
Measurements (performed using a soy bean SCS) indicate an optimal temperature of 37 °C and an optimal pH of 7.0-8.0.
"Fatal infantile lactic acidosis: Defective SCS has been implicated as a cause of fatal infantile lactic acidosis, which is a disease in infants that is characterized by the build-up of toxic levels of lactic acid. The condition (when it is most severe) results in death usually within 2–4 days after birth. It has been determined that patients with the condition display a two base pair deletion within the gene known as SUCLG1 that encodes the α subunit of SCS. As a result, functional SCS is absent in metabolism causing a major imbalance in flux between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Since the cells do not have a functional citric acid cycle, acidosis results because cells are forced to choose lactic acid production as the primary means of producing ATP."
= = = Christian Peter = = =
"Christian Peter (born October 5, 1972) is a former American football defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL). Peter's younger brother, Jason, also played in the NFL."
"Peter grew up the oldest of four children in the Locust section of Middletown Township, New Jersey."
"Peter attended Middletown High School South, where he played one year of football as a junior. The team went undefeated and won the state title in 1990."
"Peter received a full athletic scholarship to the University of Nebraska where he was a three year starter. He became one of the leaders of Nebraska's feared ""Blackshirt"" defense. Peter was an all-Big Eight Conference and honorable mention All-American in his senior year, and finished his college career with 124 total tackles, 20 tackles for loss and nine sacks. He was inducted into the Nebraska Football Hall of Fame in 2006."
"While attending Nebraska, Peter had several run-ins with the law for various offenses such as threatening a parking attendant while his vehicle was being towed, trespassing, public urination, refusing to comply with police, minor in possession of alcohol, and failure to appear in court. He was convicted four times. [3][4]"
"In 1993 Peter was accused of groping Natalie Kuijvenhoven (a former Miss Nebraska) in a crowded bar. He pled guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation, and was suspended for a 1993 exhibition game. Following the 1993 charges from Kuijvenhoven, Kathy Redmond, who attended the University of Nebraska with Peter, came forward and claimed that Peter had sexually assaulted her during their freshman year in 1991. No criminal charges were filed in the matter, but Redmond did file a Title IX suit against the University of Nebraska in 1995; the suit was settled out of court."
"In 1994, only a month before the draft, Peter was convicted of disturbing the peace after a woman accused him of grabbing her throat in a Kearney, Nebraska bar. He said he was under the influence during the altercation and admitted to responding in an inexcusable way after she had called him a rapist."
"Peter was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fifth round of the 1996 NFL Draft. The pick set off a firestorm of criticism from the Boston area press, including Patriots fans and women's groups, as well as Myra Kraft, wife of Patriots owner Robert Kraft.[3] After learning more about Peter's history, the Patriots relinquished the rights to him only a week after the draft. The team said that Peter's behavior was ""incompatible with our organization's standards of acceptable conduct.""[6] According to ""The Boston Globe"", Myra Kraft personally demanded that the Patriots cut ties with Peter.[3] It was the first time in NFL history that a drafted player had been waived by a team before the start of training camp. Partly due to the backlash, no other team expressed interest."
"After the 1996 season, the New York Giants signed Peter as a free agent on condition that he go through counseling for substance abuse, attention deficit disorder, and anger management.[7] He apologized for his behavior while at Nebraska and still speaks about the Giants today as having saved his life. After four years with the Giants, he went on to play with the Indianapolis Colts and the Chicago Bears, where he retired in 2004."
"Today, Peter speaks openly of his sobriety, past struggles, and those who have helped him along the way. He travels to schools, businesses, communities, rehabs, and correctional facilities sharing his story in hopes that someone struggling will be helped. Peter currently serves on the board of the Tigger House Foundation, a 501(c) (3) non-profit organization dedicated to achieving a positive impact by reducing the death rate of heroin and opiate addiction."
"Following the end of his international career, despite scoring over 1,000 first-class runs in the England tour including two centuries, he made only sporadic appearances in Pakistani domestic cricket. He appeared in only three Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches between 1963 and 1965; an invitational XI match for the Punjab Governor against Pakistan Universities in 1966; Pakistan versus The Rest in 1967; and lastly one appearance in the Ayub Trophy on 15 January 1968 where he scored 40 and 15 for the Lahore Reds."
"In 1982 Butt was appointed manager for the Pakistani winter tour of Australia, and in 1984 the secretary of the then Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan, a position he held until 1988 along with the presidency of the Lahore City Cricket Association. In October 2008 he was named chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. His initial actions were to suggest the possibility of neutral venues to preserve international cricket during a time of tenuous security conditions within Pakistan: ""The holding of the Champions Trophy in Pakistan depends on the security condition of the country and if the current indefinite situation prevails further we may consider the option to play on alternate venues."" He expressed relief when the 2009 Champions Trophy appeared to be going ahead in Pakistan despite security risks, and ""made a series of startling revelations"" about discussions with the International Cricket Council about merging with the Indian Premier League."
"Pakistan, however, received little support as potential hosts of the Champions Trophy, a fact on which Butt expressed surprise. He warned that a divide would occur in the world of cricket should sub-continent cricket tours be marginalised. India later cancelled their tour to Pakistan, though Butt was hoping to host Australia after the latter team expressed an interest. In October 2008 he also asked questions of the financial security of the previous PCB officials, and speculated on the removal of Geoff Lawson, then Pakistani coach, from his position. Two days later, however, he reversed his position by stating he was ""duty-bound to fully back Lawson and to take care of all his liabilities."" Shafqat Naghmi, PCB Chief Operating Officer, also threatened to sue Butt over allegations that the former was stealing official documents."
"Security concerns did not lessen, however, and Javed Miandad's resignation as director-general of the PCB resulted in traded accusations between himself and Butt at a Senate of Pakistan meeting. Butt refused to step down, and attacked the senate as a body with little actual legal power over the PCB. The senate nevertheless moved a resolution for a change in the PCB management. However, Butt remained in his position. Following an attack on a touring Sri Lanka cricket team in early 2009, Butt admitted in a public statement the difficulty international teams had in coming to the country, but accused ICC referee Chris Broad of exaggerating the problems. ICC President David Morgan, however, agreed with Broad's assessment. the 2011 Cricket World Cup was duly moved out of Pakistan."
"Butt continued to meet with the PCB board to regain the World Cup, to no avail, despite a legal battle which lasted until August. Eventually an out of court settlement of 18 million US dollars was agreed upon; Butt calling it ""the best possible solution."" Concurrently, the PCB under Butt dissolved the national selection panel and removed Saleem Altaf from his position as chief operating officer. The summer tour of Sri Lanka was also marred by match-fixing allegations over which the PCB sought legal advice. The ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit eventually cleared the Pakistan players of having had any contact with bookmakers."
"Towards the winter of 2009, Butt also came up against Younis Khan in a dispute over the captaincy, with Khan taking time out of the game. By January 2010, however, Butt ruled that a new captain would be chosen following the tour of Australia, with Khan quitting the captaincy. Further match fixing claims arose in February, and Butt promised action against the players involved following the report of an inquiry committee which investigated Pakistan's whitewash defeat during the tour of Australia. Further match fixing and financial corruption accusations followed for both Butt and the PCB in 2010. Nevertheless, the ICC announced on 11 February the awarding of a medal for Butt for services to cricket."
"Though Butt had deflected accusations of match fixing earlier in February 2010 during Pakistan's tour of Australia, the 2010 tour of England was publicly marred by controversial match fixing allegations involving a number of Pakistan players and their actions during the One Day Internationals against England and the Test series against the host nation and against Australia. Scotland Yard confirmed on 17 September that it had questioned Pakistan players Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz over allegations of accepting bribes, and that the police had passed evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. Several Pakistani players were suspended. Initially, Ijaz Butt had supported the prosecution of Amir, stating that ""his board will not make any appeals for leniency"", however on 19 September he attacked the England cricket team during a press conference, accusing them of a conspiracy to ""defraud Pakistan cricket"" by accepting their own bribes. He stated that:"
"""This is not a conspiracy to defraud bookies but a conspiracy to defraud Pakistan and Pakistan cricket... We have taken it in hand to start our own investigations. We will shortly reveal the names of the people, the parties and the bodies involved in this sinister conspiracy and we also reserve the right to sue them for damages... There is loud and clear talk in bookie circles that some English players have taken enormous amounts of money to lose the match [the third ODI]. No wonder there was such a collapse."""
"The remarks provoked a backlash from the England and Wales Cricket Board as well as England coach Andy Flower and captain Andrew Strauss. The ECB announced that it would be taking legal action against Butt for his allegations, though the tour would continue despite several England players' reluctance to participate. There were several calls for Butt to resign, however he refused. Wajid Shamsul Hasan, the Pakistan's high commissioner, defended Butt, calling the disagreement ""a very innocent argument"" and denying relationships with the United Kingdom were adversely affected. The England team later made official their demand for an apology in a letter sent to Butt, promising legal action without further warning if their request went unfulfilled. Butt arrived in London in late September vowing not to retract his comments in the run up to a meeting with the lawyers of three suspended Pakistan players; however, he later reversed course and retracted his statement. He was nevertheless recalled by the PCB for an explanation, amid speculation that his future as chairman remained tenuous. The ICC board of directors discussed sacking him in a meeting in Dubai should he not accept new anti-corruption measures."

= = = Chocolate City speech = = =
"The Chocolate City speech is the nickname that some people have given to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day speech by Ray Nagin, Mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, on January 16, 2006. The speech concerned race politics in New Orleans several months after Hurricane Katrina destroyed much of the city. The reference is to the occurrence of the phrase ""chocolate city"" in Nagin's speech, which was one of several points in the speech that occasioned significant controversy and raised accusations of racism against Mr. Nagin."
"In African American culture, the term ""chocolate city"" refers to a city with a predominantly African American population and/or African American political leadership. The concept originated with radio DJs in Washington D.C. in the early 1970s and was popularized by the band Parliament, who released the album ""Chocolate City"" in 1975. The term has been used by scholar Cornel West in his 1993 book ""Race Matters"" and by comedian Chris Rock."
"In an interview with Public Radio International's Tavis Smiley (originally broadcast on January 13, 2006) Nagin used the phrase ""chocolate city"" in reference to New Orleans' future demographics, a term that would become troublesome for him just a few days later."
"At the end of August, 2005, New Orleans had been hit by Hurricane Katrina, and catastrophic failures of the city's Federal levees flooded the majority of the city. Only a small portion of the city's evacuated population had returned by January. Some commentators were suggesting that the city's demographics would change from majority African American to majority Caucasian."
This speech put the post-Hurricane Katrina recovery process of New Orleans in the context of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Nagin's speech reflected on the problems of violence and crime in pre- and post-Katrina New Orleans. He also referred to the humanitarian plight of the largely African-American hurricane victims in the Louisiana Superdome and Morial Convention Center.
"At a Martin Luther King Day celebration at City Hall New Orleans on January 16, 2006, the mayor gave a speech."
"Nagin began the speech invoking spirits of Peace, Love, and Unity. He then described a talk he had with Martin Luther King, Jr. earlier that morning (as King was long dead, this was presumably a metaphor or rhetorical device). Nagin then described some of the problems and suffering New Orleans had been experiencing since the hurricane, with the repeated refrain that Dr. King says ""I wouldn't like that""."
"Shortly after, Nagin continued, ""We as black people, it's time, it's time for us to come together. It's time for us to rebuild a New Orleans, the one that should be a chocolate New Orleans. And I don't care what people are saying Uptown or wherever they are. This city will be chocolate at the end of the day."""
"Nagin also stated that New Orleans ""will be a majority African-American city. It's the way God wants it to be."" As most New Orleanians knew the city had been majority African American for decades before Katrina, Ned Sublette of The Nation found the implication of Nagin claiming to know God's will more troubling than the suggested return of pre-Katrina demographics."
"In the same speech, Nagin further stirred controversy by claiming that ""God is mad at America. He sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane, and it's destroyed and put stress on this country...Surely he doesn't approve of us being in Iraq under false pretenses. But surely he is upset at black America also. We're not taking care of ourselves."" Nagin then went on to relate an imagined conversation with the deceased Rev. Martin Luther King regarding both the response to Katrina and the modern problems of black America which he believes offended God."
"The speech generated an intense reaction, much of it negative. The ""Chocolate City"" metaphor was seized on and parodied by commentators, and cartoons depicting Nagin as Willy Wonka appeared in print and on the internet. A ""Times-Picayune"" commentator suggested that Nagin had just ruined his own chances at re-election."
"Political commentators point out that while this may just have been another example of Nagin speaking off the cuff, it will likely hurt his standing among white voters."
"Many people believed the word ""uptown"" to be a coded reference to wealthy whites, such as those who live in the old mansions on St. Charles Avenue or around Audubon Park. However, Uptown New Orleans actually is one of the most ethnically and economically diverse sections of the Metro area. Many of Nagin's original supporters live Uptown. As Uptown contains the largest section of unflooded high ground in the city's East Bank, at the time of the speech Uptown had the city's largest concentration of locals back in their homes, businesses back open, and displaced New Orleanians from other more severely damaged parts of town living there. Locals protested the Mayor's comment which some felt suggested he did not care about an important section of his city."
"Nagin later attempted to explain away his remarks by offering a more racially inclusive metaphor, saying ""How do you make chocolate? You take dark chocolate, you mix it with white milk and it becomes a delicious drink. That's the chocolate I'm talking about."""
"The Blue Night Network is the overnight public transit service operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The network consists of a basic grid of 27 bus and 4 streetcar routes, distributed so that almost all of the city is within 2 km of at least one route. It is the largest and most frequent night network in North America."
"The times of Blue Night service vary according to individual scheduling situations on each route. Most regular service bus and streetcar routes cease operations at approximately 1:30 a.m. If there is a Blue Night route on the same street, its first trip will then follow at a suitable interval after the last regular run."
"On the subway system, the last trains on each line make a complete trip; the last trains running east, west, and north from Bloor–Yonge and St. George stations each leave at 1:50 a.m. or just after. Each station then closes as the last train passes it."
"In the morning, regular bus and streetcar service mostly takes over from the corresponding Blue Night routes around 5:30a.m, or 8:00a.m. on Sundays. The first trains on the subway then start from various positions along the routes, allowing all stations to open more or less simultaneously just before 6:00a.m., or 8:00a.m. on Sundays. The Blue Night routes that parallel the subway lines keep running until that time, and their last buses terminate service at a subway station to facilitate transfers to the trains."
"Normal TTC fares apply on the Blue Night Network. Passengers can transfer to or from regular-service routes as usual. Additionally, TTC passes valid for the previous day are honoured until 5:30a.m. the next day, rather than midnight."
"Blue Night routes operate with frequencies of every 30 minutes or better. Blue Night routes are distinguished from regular routes by numbers in the 300 series. Numbering on these routes can correspond to a day route, such as 301 Queen being Blue Night for 501 Queen. Routings are often combinations of multiple-day routes or slight alterations to their corresponding day route."
"Most routes are operated by TTC's fleet of low-floor buses, where applicable, making them fully accessible for handicapped and wheelchair users. Four routes operate with streetcars: the 301 Queen, the 304 King, the 306 Carlton, and the 310 Spadina. As of January 2020, all of these routes are operated with accessible Flexity Outlook streetcars."
"Toronto has had overnight streetcar service since the days of the Toronto Railway Company in the 1890s, and the TTC continued it when they took over in 1921. The routes selected for 24-hour service were those serving 24-hour employers such as factories, stockyards, and railway yards."
"Over the years various streetcar routes were replaced by other modes, and where new subway lines replaced streetcars during regular hours, buses were put on overnight. But the overnight routings remained largely unchanged for decades, even after the TTC's service area expanded in 1954 from the Toronto city limits as they then were, to include the whole of Metropolitan Toronto (""Metro"", which in 1998 became the present amalgamated city of Toronto). Only one overnight route (the Queen streetcar, later 501 Queen, to Long Branch loop) extended a significant distance into the suburbs."
"In 1974, after the subway had been extended beyond the Toronto city limits in three directions, the same was done for overnight bus service. But large areas of Metro still remained without 24-hour transit — Etobicoke, North York, and Scarborough each had only one or two routes — as late as 1986, when the TTC's planning department issued a report on ""Metro All-Night Transit Service"" calling for major changes."
"The report pointed out that the importance of the original ""demand generators"" for overnight public transit had declined. Nightly demand was now twice as heavy on weekends as on weekdays, showing that not many people were using transit to get to night work. And as Metro had grown, only 45% of its population still lived within a 15-minute walk of the existing 24-hour transit routes. In fact, hardly any of the 14 overnight routes then in existence were strictly justified by demand any more, particularly on weekdays. But since ""one of the TTC's primary goals is to maximize mobility and accessibility to transit service"", the report's recommendation was to redesign the system, not eliminate it."
"Most of Toronto has a squarish grid of main streets that originated as township roads and are spaced at 1¼-mile intervals (about 2 km). By running overnight buses along every second road in the grid, all parts of Metro would be reached and 86% of the population would be within a 15-minute walk (taken as 1.25 km or ¾ mile). To avoid excessively long trips, some grid streets such as Eglinton Avenue would require two bus routes meeting end-to-end, but still just 15 routes would be needed to form the grid. The 506 Carlton route had sufficient traffic to be retained in addition, for a total of 16 routes."
"This is what the report proposed. In changing from the old network of 14 routes to the new set of 16, only 2 routes would be entirely unchanged. There would be 11 entirely new overnight routes (all bus-operated), with 7 existing ones eliminated (3 streetcar, 3 trolleybus, and only 1 bus route, as the night network would be shifted away from the streetcar tracks and trolleybus wires)."
"Despite the route eliminations and probable increased ridership, the changes could not be expected to finance themselves. The report recommended reducing service frequencies after 10 p.m. on certain routes in order to offset the increased costs."
"The Commission agreed to the expanded service, but could not stomach the elimination of so many routes. Instead, they chose to retain all existing routes despite the cost, creating a 23-route night system."
"Until this time, with the exception of buses that replaced subway lines, it had been understood that overnight transit was provided by regular routes that happened to have 24-hour service. Night services retained the same route names and numbers as their daytime counterparts, perhaps with a suffixed letter if there was a variation in the exact routing. But now a marketing decision was made to treat the overnight service as a new, distinct set of routes, even in those cases where the day route was identical."
"The name Blue Night Network was adopted, and with it the 300-series route numbers described above, and a new color-coding for bus and streetcar stops. The existing standard TTC-stop sign had a red square or stripe at the top and bottom; now, for all stops with 24-hour service, this was changed to red and blue, with the legend ""24 hr"" added. Those stops used only for the Blue Night Network, mostly for night routes paralleling the subway, received the standard sign with red changed to blue (and a notice of the limited hours). The Blue Night Network debuted in February 1987."
"In the 1990s, the TTC suffered major funding cuts and service on many low-traffic routes was reduced; the Blue Night Network lost three routes in February 1992, selected from those proposed for elimination in 1986. But other routes have been extended or added over the years, including one case (312 St. Clair in 2000) that required a mode conversion from streetcar to bus. In February 2003, two Blue Night routes were extended to reach Toronto Pearson International Airport."
"Then in 2005, several routes were added so that east–west service would run on every grid street instead of alternate ones in much of the city. This has brought the Blue Night Network up to a total of 24 routes, serving 97% of the city's population within a 15-minute walk."
"In the fall of 2015, the TTC expanded the Blue Night Network program, with 16 new or revised routes incorporated into the network as part of a $95 million investment made by Toronto City Council. This included the restoration of streetcar service on King Street as the 304 King and on Spadina Avenue as the 310 Spadina, operating entirely with low-floor Flexity streetcars. , the 310 Spadina, 306 Carlton, 304 King, and 301 Queen operate using accessible Flexity streetcars, with the remaining routes converted to the Flexity streetcars by the end of 2019 in line with the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act."
= = = Kenta Kobayashi = = =
", is a Japanese professional wrestler currently signed to New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he performs under the mononymous ring name Kenta (stylised in all capital letters), and is a member of the Bullet Club stable."
"He is known for his time in Pro Wrestling Noah where he was a one-time Global Honored Crown (GHC) Heavyweight Champion, three-time GHC Junior Heavyweight Champion, three-time GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champion, and one-time GHC Tag Team Champion; once was the inaugural reign with longtime partner and rival, Naomichi Marufuji, which saw the two hold the title for almost two years, as well as a reign with protégé Taiji Ishimori. He was also the winner of the 2012 Global League and the 2013 Global Tag League tournaments."
"He is also well known for his tenure in American promotion WWE where he worked under the name Hideo Itami in the company's developmental territory NXT and later in their cruiserweight exclusive brand 205 Live. A former amateur kickboxer, Kobayashi's wrestling style is based upon strong kicks and strikes. Kobayashi started his career in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), before moving to Pro Wrestling Noah; through Noah's involvement in the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA), a global organization of cooperative promotions that allow their competitors to travel abroad to other companies, he has wrestled extensively in American promotion Ring of Honor (ROH)."
"Kobayashi was born on March 12, 1981, in Sōka, Japan. He trained under Kenta Kobashi and Yoshihiro Takayama."
"Prior to wrestling professionally, Kobayashi had a variety of athletic backgrounds, practicing baseball and kickboxing; the latter came to be a strong foundation in his wrestling style often referred to as shoot style. Kobayashi made his professional wrestling debut on May 24, 2000 against future ally and rival, Naomichi Marufuji, in All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) to compete in their junior heavyweight division. He did not remain in the company long as Mitsuharu Misawa, acting president of AJPW, decided to secede from the company following a dispute with other forces, thus leading to Misawa forming his own company, Pro Wrestling Noah."
"One of Misawa's focuses in his new promotion was the junior heavyweight division, which never was treated with high regard in AJPW despite the successes in other promotions. Being sidelined with injuries for the majority of Noah's first year of operation, Kobayashi made his return in July 2001, simply named Kenta."
"Kenta's first involvement in a championship situation came when Naomichi Marufuji was forced to vacate the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship after suffering a knee injury; Kenta entered into the tournament held to determine a new champion. He advanced to the finals by defeating Kotaro Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi before losing to Yoshinobu Kanemaru on the ""Navigation with Breeze Tour"" in June 2002. Following his relative success in the tournament, Kenta had an increase in his popularity, and he joined his mentor, Kenta Kobashi, in the faction Burning."
"March 1, 2003 saw Kenta team with Naomichi Marufuji for the first time against Makoto Hashi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru in a winning effort. They began teaming regularly as the two entered into a tournament to christen the first GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions during the company's ""Accomplish Our Third Navigation tour""; they went to win the tournament by defeating junior heavyweight veterans Jyushin Thunder Liger and Takehiro Murahama in the finals on July 16. While defending the tag team title, Kenta continued his venture in hopes of winning the GHC Junior Heavyweight title once again on November 30, 2003, in an unsuccessful bid against Takashi Sugiura."
"As part of a reward for the way Kenta performed, he earned himself a trial series of seven matches going into the next year, seeing Kenta able to challenge more established stars in an attempt to elevate his status. Kenta began his trial series on the ""First Navigation"" tour, beating Juventud Guerrera. This was followed by defeats to Yoshinari Ogawa and Jun Akiyama. The final match of the series was a loss against Marufuji in October. While the series was taking place, Kenta and Marufuji continued defending their title against a number of challengers: El Samurai and Ryusuke Taguchi, Yoshinari Ogawa and Kotaro Suzuki, Suzuki and Ricky Marvin, Marvin and Suwa and, on Noah's first Tokyo Dome show, against Kendo Kashin and Takashi Sugiura. Their reign as champions came to an end in June 2005 after almost two years by Kanemaru and Sugiura after the latter pinned Kenta."
"The half-pass requires more balance, engagement, and collection from a horse than the leg-yield. This is because the horse is slightly bent in the direction of movement in the half-pass. In the leg-yield, the horse is fairly straight or looking slightly away from the direction of travel."
"The half-pass is a schooling movement that requires the horse to engage the hindquarters and increase its impulsion, it can therefore be used to improve both collection or impulsion. The half-pass is commonly seen in dressage tests beginning at the United States Dressage Federation third level."
"The half-pass is usually taught after the haunches-in is well confirmed. It may first be introduced by riding a half-10-meter circle from the long side to the centerline, or a half-volte, and then half-passing in. The circle naturally places the horse's body in the correct bend, and helps to encourage the engagement needed for the movement. The outside hind leg must step well under the horse's body to push the animal forward and sideways. A rider uses an active outside leg slightly behind the neutral position to ask the horse to step forward and under. The outside rein maintains the correct bend and contains the energy of the horse, the inside leg keeps the horse moving forward, and the inside rein guides the forehand in the direction of movement. The rider also uses his or her inside seat bone to help maintain bend. If the rider is off-center or twisted, the horse will also be crooked or off-balance."
"If the horse loses quality in the movement, such as lack of correct bend (haunches leading or inside shoulder falling inward), loss of rhythm, or stiffness, the rider straightens the horse and rides forward."
The beginning and the end of the movement needs special attention concerning control and balance.

"Bellingham International Airport is three miles (5 km) northwest of Bellingham, in Whatcom County, Washington, and the third-largest commercial airport in Washington. BLI covers 2,190 acres (886 ha) of land."
"Bellingham is well known as a low-fare alternative airport to the Vancouver International Airport, and an estimated 65% of customers come from Canada. It is only from downtown Vancouver, and only from the Canadian border, where Greater Vancouver starts. On the Allegiant website the airport is referred to as Bellingham/Vancouver."
"The newly constructed gate area has five gates, a coffee shop and a restaurant with a bar. The second phase of the terminal expansion will add a baggage carousel in addition to larger ticketing and pre-security areas for passengers, should have been completed in phases beginning in 2012 and with completion expected by 2015."
"In 1936 Whatcom County obtained for an airport at the current airport site. Three runways were planned, but it took almost four years to get the first 5000' x 150' runway cleared and paved. Temporary Port of Entry status was secured early, but the slow construction left it in a continually tenuous state – United Airlines would only base there if the field were safe enough for their DC-3s, and it maintained its Port of Entry status. Ultimately they built a terminal, designed by F. Stanley Piper, and the airport was dedicated in 1940, having employed more than 500 people."
"In 1940 the United States Army Corps of Engineers took over the facility and expanded it to three full runways, revetments for parking aircraft, and development of personnel quarters. During World War II the airport was used by Fourth Air Force immediately after the Pearl Harbor Attack for air defense of the Pacific Coast. It was later used by Air Transport Command and Air Technical Service Command as an intermediate ferrying field for Lend-Lease aircraft being flown to Alaska for subsequent transfer to the Soviet Union."
"The United States Army Air Forces closed the facility in September 1946, and it was turned over to the War Assets Administration for disposal. It slowly was returned to Whatcom County and was redeveloped as a civil airport in the late 1940s. With the rising costs and need for repairs, Whatcom county sold the Airport to the Port of Bellingham for one dollar in 1957. Because of costs, the Port of Bellingham could only resurface the longest of the runways (16/34). 16/34 is still the only runway used as it provides adequate year-round wind coverage for aircraft servicing Bellingham. The two diagonal runways have fallen into disrepair, their easternmost ends used as taxiways between tarmacs and the sole remaining runway."
"Airline service from Bellingham had a modest beginning. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Harbor Airlines, a commuter air carrier based in Washington, operated nonstop shuttle service to Seattle/Tacoma International Airport with small Britten-Norman Islander twin prop aircraft. By the mid 1980s, Harbor Air had been replaced by San Juan Airlines, a commuter air carrier based in Bellingham which operated shuttle flights to Seattle/Tacoma with Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante turboprops and Cessna 402 prop aircraft. San Juan Airlines continues to serve the airport at the present time."
"In 1985 Pacific Southwest Airlines (PSA) initiated Bellingham's first passenger jet service with McDonnell Douglas MD-80s direct to Los Angeles, San Diego and San Francisco with all PSA flights including a stop at Seattle/Tacoma. PSA was acquired by USAir which continued to serve Bellingham with Boeing 737-300s. Alaska Airlines introduced MD-80 jets in the late 1980s, competing with USAir with both airlines operating nonstop jet service to Seattle/Tacoma and direct one stop service to other destinations. USAir then changed its name to US Airways and eventually merged with American Airlines in 2015; however, by the early 1990s, USAir had ceased serving Bellingham. During the late 1980s, Alaska Airlines was joined by Horizon Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Alaska Air Group, with this regional airline flying nonstop service with turboprops to Seattle/Tacoma. Aircraft operated by Horizon Air into the airport over the years included such propjets as the Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner, the de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 and the Dornier 328. Horizon Air, which currently operates flights for Alaska Airlines, continues to serve Bellingham at the present time with nonstop service to Seattle/Tacoma flown with the Bombardier Q400 turboprop which is the largest and fastest member of the Dash 8 regional airliner family. Commencing in the late 1980s, United Express was serving the airport with nonstop flights to Seattle/Tacoma on behalf of United Airlines via code sharing agreements with the respective operating air carriers. North Pacific Airlines operated the first United Express flights into Bellingham with British Aerospace BAe Jetstream 31 propjets and were followed by SkyWest Airlines flying as United Express with Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprops. United Express no longer serves Bellingham."
In the 1990s homes were purchased to extend the runway in an effort to attract air carriers. The assumption is that there would not be a third runway at Sea-Tac airport. The airport has seen a high turnover rate.
"In September 2010 the airport completed a $26 million resurfacing of the runway to allow aircraft up to the size of Boeing 757s. This project was completed to enable Allegiant Air to operate Boeing 757-200 service nonstop to Hawaii, although this service has since ended. The largest aircraft currently serving Bellingham as of July 2019 are Allegiant Air's Airbus A320 aircraft flying to several destinations on the West Coast."
The airport is expanding the terminal building from . The first phase is complete with a new gate area completed and temporary portable waiting areas removed. The second phase started in 2012 and reach completion by 2015 and will expand the pre-security areas of the airport including the addition of a baggage carousel for arriving passengers. The cost of the expansion to the terminal building is covered by surcharges from passengers and parking fees.
"The current terminal building was built in two phases. The first phase was completed in 1980. The second phase, or the expansion phase, was constructed because of increased passenger volumes and the arrival of new air carriers. In 1985, a separate International Terminal was built to the south in order to accommodate the Federal Inspection Services necessary for international travelers to access the United States; it is connected to the main terminal through a covered walkway. The main terminal is approximately 26,000 square feet and includes three levels, the basement, the ground floor, and the second floor. The basement houses a small storage facility; the ground floor is where the entire passenger processing area is held, and the second floor contains office space. There is one concession stand: Halibut Henry's store where light snacks, coffee drinks, gifts, and sundries are offered. The International Terminal is a one-level building consisting of 4,222 square feet. It serves several functions including the housing of the Federal Inspection Service, FIS offices, and the storage of BLI's Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting equipment."
The early 21st century saw rapid expansion at the Bellingham International Airport from several air carriers operating mainline jet aircraft with these airlines being motivated by the potential passenger loads from lower mainland British Columbia in Canada. Allegiant's commitment to the airport has led to a rapid rise in passenger numbers and the introduction of a number of nonstop destinations served from Bellingham. Other airlines have recognized the potential of Bellingham International's location and further expanded service into the airport.
"In early 2007 Bellingham International hosted nonstop service to three destinations by the short-lived Western Airlines which was operating Boeing 737-400 jets and was based in Bellingham. Western attempted to establish a small hub at the airport with nonstop service to Ontario, California (ONT), Phoenix, Arizona (via the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, AZA) and San Diego, California (SAN). Later the same year, Skybus Airlines operated nonstop flights to their Columbus, Ohio (CMH) hub with Airbus A319 jetliners but then shut down quickly like Western Airlines had done earlier."
"On March 1, 2008, Allegiant Air opened up their sixth base at Bellingham International Airport. The airline currently bases a number of aircraft in Bellingham which serves as a ""focus city"" for the airline. In 2012 Allegiant announced service to two locations in the Hawaiian islands (Honolulu and Kahului) from Bellingham after receiving ETOPS certification from the FAA for their 757 aircraft. Alaska also entered the market with flights to Honolulu, Kahului and Kona. As of July 2019, both Allegiant and Alaska no longer serve Hawaii from Bellingham."
In September 2010 the airport completed a $26 million resurfacing of the runway to allow aircraft up to the size of Boeing 757s to utilize the airport. This project was completed in order to serve Allegiant 757 service to Honolulu and Maui which began operations in November 2012.
"In response to the increased low fare competition offered by Allegiant in their home state, Alaska Airlines expanded service from Bellingham International; first adding daily flights to Las Vegas and followed by a daily roundtrip nonstop to Honolulu, both of which are now discontinued. Frontier Airlines announced in early 2012 the addition of a daily seasonal summer service from Bellingham to its main hub in Denver beginning May 2012. Frontier flew Airbus A319 and Embraer ERJ-190 jets from Bellingham but subsequently ceased serving the airport."
"The runway and taxiway resurfacing and improvement projects were funded with FAA Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants covering 95% of project costs. In 2010 the FAA contribution towards airport projects was $27,267,000. The 5% local match came from BLI Passenger Facility Charge accounts. FAA AIP grants also have contributed to the acquisition of additional Airport Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment, Aircraft de-ice equipment and other surface projects. The BLI PFC fee per passenger is currently at the FAA mandated maximum of $4.50 per enplaned passenger. The Terminal and ramp expansion projects are not AIP eligible as they are revenue generating facilities for the airport. The Port of Bellingham issues Revenue Bonds for $31,719,550 to pay for the terminal expansion. The debt service for the bonds also comes from BLI PFC accounts. In this way, the users of the airport facilities are the ones actually paying for the facility."
"Bellingham International Airport has bustling general aviation activity. Some of which is for the purpose of sightseeing in the San Juan Islands, Victoria in British Columbia, or the Canadian Gulf Islands. The majority of general aviation operations are commercial in nature; charters, flight training, transient, and private business operations provide essential contributions to the economy. It is also a convenient Port of Entry for those flying internationally. General aviation facilities comprise a site of approximately 20 acres south of the passenger terminal facilities. There are total a 73 tie-down spaces; 48 for based aircraft and 25 for transient aircraft. 103 aircraft are sheltered by seven T-hangar and corporate aircraft structures. There is also a terminal building dedicated to general aviation servicing."
"The Washington Air National Guard (WANG) occupies a 7.5-acre site at Bellingham International Airport. The Washington Air National Guard is home of the 262nd Combat Communications Squadron. The 262nd's mission is to train and equip combat communications personnel, where they field, install, operate, and maintain Ground Mobile Force communications. In other words, the 262nd equips soldiers with their battlefield communication systems and trains them how to use and maintain the equipment. The WANG base consists of vehicle storage, a headquarters building, a maintenance building, and other miscellaneous storage buildings."
"The battlefield fell silent around 10:30 p.m., except for the cries of the wounded and dying. Gen. Meade telegraphed to General-in-Chief Henry Halleck in Washington:"
"Meade made his decision late that night in a council of war that included his senior staff officers and corps commanders. The assembled officers agreed that, despite the beating the army took, it was advisable for the army to remain in its present position and to await attack by the enemy, although there was some disagreement about how long to wait if Lee chose not to attack. There is some evidence that Meade had already decided this issue and was using the meeting not as a formal council of war, but as a way to achieve consensus among officers he had commanded for less than a week. As the meeting broke up, Meade took aside Brig. Gen. John Gibbon, in command of the II Corps, and predicted, ""If Lee attacks tomorrow, it will be in your front. ... he has made attacks on both our flanks and failed and if he concludes to try it again, it will be on our centre."""
"There was considerably less confidence in Confederate headquarters that night. The army had suffered a significant defeat by not dislodging their enemy. A staff officer remarked that Lee was ""not in good humor over the miscarriage of his plans and his orders."" But in Lee's report, he showed more optimism:"
"Years later, Longstreet would write that his troops on the second day had done the ""best three hours' fighting done by any troops on any battle-field."" That night he continued to advocate for a strategic movement around the Union left flank, but Lee would hear none of it. He sent orders to Richard Ewell to ""assail the enemy's right"" at daylight, and he ordered Jeb Stuart (who had finally arrived at Lee's headquarters early that afternoon) to operate on Ewell's left and rear."
"Casualty figures for the second day of Gettysburg are difficult to assess because both armies reported by unit after the full battle, not by day. One estimate is that the Confederates lost approximately 6,000 killed, missing, or wounded from Hood's, McLaws's, and Anderson's divisions, amounting to 30–40% casualties. Union casualties in these actions probably exceeded 9,000. An estimate for the day's total (including the Culp's and Cemetery Hill actions) by historian Noah Trudeau is 10,000 Union, 6,800 Confederate. This is in comparison to approximately 9,000 Union and 6,000 Confederate casualties on the first day, although there were much larger percentages of the armies engaged the second. Some estimates of total casualties for the day run as high as 20,000 and declare it the bloodiest day of the Battle of Gettysburg. It is a testament to the ferocity of the day's battle that such high casualties figures resulted even with much of the fighting not occurring until late in the afternoon and thereafter lasting about six hours. By comparison, the Battle of Antietam—known famously as the bloodiest single day in American military history with nearly 23,000 casualties—was an engagement that lasted twelve hours, or about twice as long."
"On the night of July 2, all of the remaining elements of both armies had arrived: Stuart's cavalry and Pickett's division for the Confederates and John Sedgwick's Union VI Corps. The stage was set for the bloody climax of the three-day battle."
= = = SystemVerilog = = =
"SystemVerilog, standardized as IEEE 1800, is a hardware description and hardware verification language used to model, design, simulate, test and implement electronic systems. SystemVerilog is based on Verilog and some extensions, and since 2008 Verilog is now part of the same IEEE standard. It is commonly used in the semiconductor and electronic design industry as an evolution of Verilog."
"SystemVerilog started with the donation of the Superlog language to Accellera in 2002 by the startup company Co-Design Automation. The bulk of the verification functionality is based on the OpenVera language donated by Synopsys. In 2005, SystemVerilog was adopted as IEEE Standard 1800-2005. In 2009, the standard was merged with the base Verilog (IEEE 1364-2005) standard, creating IEEE Standard 1800-2009. The current version is IEEE standard 1800-2017."
The feature-set of SystemVerilog can be divided into two distinct roles:
The remainder of this article discusses the features of SystemVerilog not present in Verilog-2005.
"There are two types of data lifetime specified in SystemVerilog: static and automatic. Automatic variables are created the moment program execution comes to the scope of the variable. Static variables are created at the start of the program's execution and keep the same value during the entire program's lifespan, unless assigned a new value during execution."
"Any variable that is declared inside a task or function without specifying type will be considered automatic. To specify that a variable is static place the ""codice_1"" keyword in the declaration before the type, e.g., ""codice_2"". The ""codice_3"" keyword is used in the same way."
"Enhanced variable types add new capability to Verilog's ""reg"" type:"
"Verilog-1995 and -2001 limit reg variables to behavioral statements such as RTL code. SystemVerilog extends the reg type so it can be driven by a single driver such as gate or module. SystemVerilog names this type ""logic"" to remind users that it has this extra capability and is not a hardware register. The names ""logic"" and ""reg"" are interchangeable. A signal with more than one driver (such as a tri-state buffer for general-purpose input/output) needs to be declared a net type such as ""wire"" so SystemVerilog can resolve the final value."
"Multidimensional packed arrays unify and extend Verilog's notion of ""registers"" and ""memories"":"
"Classical Verilog permitted only one dimension to be declared to the left of the variable name. SystemVerilog permits any number of such ""packed"" dimensions. A variable of packed array type maps 1:1 onto an integer arithmetic quantity. In the example above, each element of codice_4 may be used in expressions as a six-bit integer. The dimensions to the right of the name (32 in this case) are referred to as ""unpacked"" dimensions. As in Verilog-2001, any number of unpacked dimensions is permitted."
"Enumerated data types (codice_5) allow numeric quantities to be assigned meaningful names. Variables declared to be of enumerated type cannot be assigned to variables of a different enumerated type without casting. This is not true of parameters, which were the preferred implementation technique for enumerated quantities in Verilog-2005:"
"As shown above, the designer can specify an underlying arithmetic type (codice_6 in this case) which is used to represent the enumeration value. The meta-values X and Z can be used here, possibly to represent illegal states. The built-in function codice_7 returns an ASCII string for the current enumerated value, which is useful in validation and testing."
"New integer types: SystemVerilog defines codice_8, codice_9, codice_10 and codice_11 as two-state signed integral types having 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits respectively. A codice_12 type is a variable-width two-state type that works much like codice_13. Two-state types lack the X and Z metavalues of classical Verilog; working with these types may result in faster simulation."
"Structures and unions work much like they do in the C programming language. SystemVerilog enhancements include the packed attribute and the tagged attribute. The codice_14 attribute allows runtime tracking of which member(s) of a union are currently in use. The codice_15 attribute causes the structure or union to be mapped 1:1 onto a packed array of bits. The contents of codice_16 data types occupy a continuous block of memory with no gaps, similar to bitfields in C and C++:"
"As shown in this example, SystemVerilog also supports typedefs, as in C and C++."
"SystemVerilog introduces three new procedural blocks intended to model hardware: codice_17 (to model combinational logic), codice_18 (for flip-flops), and codice_19 (for latches). Whereas Verilog used a single, general-purpose codice_20 block to model different types of hardware structures, each of SystemVerilog's new blocks is intended to model a specific type of hardware, by imposing semantic restrictions to ensure that hardware described by the blocks matches the intended usage of the model. An HDL compiler or verification program can take extra steps to ensure that only the intended type of behavior occurs."
An codice_17 block models combinational logic. The simulator infers the sensitivity list to be all variables from the contained statements:
"An codice_19 block is meant to infer a level-sensitive latch. Again, the sensitivity list is inferred from the code:"
An codice_18 block is meant to model synchronous logic (especially edge-sensitive sequential logic):
"Electronic design automation (EDA) tools can verify the design's intent by checking that the hardware model does not violate any block usage semantics. For example, the new blocks restrict assignment to a variable by allowing only one source, whereas Verilog's codice_20 block permitted assignment from multiple procedural sources."
"For small designs, the Verilog ""port"" compactly describes a module's connectivity with the surrounding environment. But major blocks within a large design hierarchy typically possess port counts in the thousands. SystemVerilog introduces concept of interfaces to both reduce the redundancy of port-name declarations between connected modules, as well as group and abstract related signals into a user-declared bundle. Additional concept is modport, that shows direction of logic connections."
Example:
"The following verification features are typically not synthesizable, meaning they cannot be implemented in hardware based on HDL code. Instead, they assist in the creation of extensible, flexible test benches."
"TSG officers are not routinely armed, but are equipped with Speedcuffs, Monadnock fixed batons and CS/PAVA Incapacitant Spray like divisional officers. TSG does, however, have its own firearms capability with some officers being trained as Authorised Firearms Officers (AFOs) on standard-issue firearms such as the Glock 17 and Heckler & Koch MP5 semi-automatic carbine, as well as less-lethal weaponry such as the L104A1 Baton Gun and X26 Taser. Officers conduct certain infrequent armed patrols within London, usually supplementing Specialist Firearms Command. Instead of TSG officers wearing standard black trousers and white shirt, when policing demonstrations they often wear fire-retardant overalls with their stab vests underneath."
"Officers in the TSG have faced criticism about their policing methods and complaints have been made against officers of the TSG. Senior officers say that the type of work that the TSG are involved with, policing protests and performing drug raids makes them more likely to have complaints made against them."
"As the result of a freedom of information request made by ""The Guardian"" newspaper, it was revealed that more than 5,000 complaints were made against the TSG in 4 years but only 9 have been upheld. Commenting on these figures, a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority stated that officers in the TSG are ""practically immune"" from criticism."
"One ex-Metropolitan Police officer suggested that TSG members, ""spend (their) days waiting for action, and far too many officers join seeking excitement and physical confrontation."" Some officers are ex-military personnel and these are ""the worst bullies"" as ""the laws of the battlefield are not appropriate to the streets of our capital""."
"In 1997 a man was beaten by officers from the TSG in what was described as an ""outrageous display of brutality"", which only stopped when the man pretended to be unconscious. The man was charged with assault and threatening behaviour over the incident but was cleared after photographs of his injuries showed the officers had lied about the case under oath. After the man's acquittal the officers went on trial accused of assault in 1999 but were later cleared."
"In 2003, six officers of the TSG performed what a judge in 2009 called a ""serious, gratuitous and prolonged"" assault on a terrorist suspect, Babar Ahmad, a 34-year-old IT support analyst who was not subsequently charged with any offence. The officers involved had already been the subject of as many as 60 complaints about unwarranted assaults against other men. A number of mail sacks containing these complaints were somehow lost. The accusations were investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission but that they were found to be unsubstantiated. Five of the six officers were still members of the TSG in 2009. Babar Ahmed was later awarded £60,000 compensation, by the High Court, for the assault. In August, 2009, it was announced that the police officers accused of attacking Babar Ahmad would face criminal charges. However all four officers were found not guilty in June 2011 after a recording from listening device placed in Mr. Ahmed's home surfaced shortly before the trial which ""proved the account originally given by these officers was correct and specific details of the complaint made by Mr. Ahmad were not present"""
"In 2005 a Kurdish youth recorded an officer on his mobile phone telling him """"If you say one more fucking word, I'll smash your fucking Arab face in"""" after he was stopped near Paddington Green police station. The officer was suspended but denied the charge."
"Another investigation into six other officers of the TSG by the IPCC was launched following allegations made by three men that they were racially abused during an incident during June 2007 in Paddington. A van of officers stopped after seeing youths mouthing obscenities towards them. The officers appeared in court in December 2008 and were prosecuted; two for racially abusing the men, four of misconduct in a public office and one of racially aggravated assault. The Guardian reported that a request may have been made to restrict reporting of the trial by the media. The officer who was driving the van acted as a whistleblower during the trial. One officer, a former Royal Marine, accused in this case was also involved in the assault of Babar Ahmed and has had 31 complaints lodged against him since 1993. In November 2009 he was cleared of all offences, along with the other officers, and returned to work with the TSG."
"During the 2009 G-20 London summit protests two officers of the TSG were suspended from duty following publication of videos which recorded alleged assaults on members of the public at the 2009 G-20 London summit protests and at a subsequent memorial. In the first case, the member of the public, Ian Tomlinson, died shortly afterwards. In the second case, Sgt Delroy (Tony) Smellie was seen hitting Nicola Fisher. Following her complaint, the Crown Prosecution Service announced in September 2009, that there was sufficient evidence to charge Sgt Smellie with assault. He appeared in court on 16 November 2009 and was cleared of assault charges on 31 March 2010 at City of Westminster Magistrates' Court."
"However, he could still face misconduct proceedings over the incident."
"Video evidence shows that the officer seen hitting Ian Tomlinson had his face covered and that the officers involved in both cases were not displaying their identification numbers. Following the investigation into police handling of the protest, the human rights group Liberty called for further study of what it referred to as the """"militaristic approach"""" used by the TSG."
"The TSG and their predecessors, the SPG, have been likened to paramilitary units during riot control operations by Tony Jefferson in ""The Case against Paramilitary Policing"" (1990). He argues this because of their use of shields, batons and helmets, their centralised command structure, their willingness to use force and their squad-like formations. Peter Waddington counters this conclusion in the British Journal of Criminology by pointing out that their equipment is mainly defensive. As employees, the police force have a duty to protect them from harm, he also notes that paramedics in riot situations also wear similar helmets and armour. Jefferson argues that by the police preparing for an event, such as a march or protest where they expect there to be violence, they create a self-fulfilling prophecy and that violence will occur. Waddington responds to this by pointing out that the TSG were deployed at the Notting Hill Carnival every year and yet there was not always violence. Jefferson also believes that by controlling the ground the TSG incites violence, Waddington cites examples (including the Battle of the Beanfield) where problems were caused by the police not controlling the ground and that when they have then tried to gain control violence ensued."
"Waddington states that if the presence of the TSG caused violence, then violence would not occur if they were not deployed. Waddington uses examples from three Poll Tax Riots to illustrate that the assumption that their deployment causes violence is not correct. When the TSG were not deployed, serious disorder occurred, including a fully-fledged riot. In contrast when the TSG, including specialists in riot control, were deployed there was less violence. What is more he found that the more the police planned for the 'worst-case scenario' the less disorder there was. When they controlled the space and the crowd was at its greatest, violence was lowest. Waddington states that whilst the deployment of the TSG in a riot situation is never desirable, it is often essential to maintain order and limit violence. However, he also believes that the use of force should be as minimal as possible and that it should only be used to achieve publicly acceptable purposes."
The TSG operates from four bases located around London:
"The 1TSG unit based in Paddington Green Police Station was decommissioned in 2016 relating to poor working practices, unauthorised claiming of overtime and bullying."
= = = Midland–Odessa = = =
"Midland–Odessa is a metropolitan area located in West Texas approximately half-way between El Paso and Fort Worth, Texas. This combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of two metropolitan statistical areas (the Midland MSA and the Odessa MSA), and comprises three counties: Martin, Midland and Ector counties. The Midland–Odessa CSA is informally known as The Petroplex."
"In the past, the cities of Midland and Odessa experienced a rivalry of bitter competition and political intrigue. Since the early 1990s, the nature of the rivalry has changed into one of friendly competition and economic cooperation. The Midland–Odessa area today is marketed as ""Two Cities, no Limits."""
"The Midland–Odessa combined statistical area, informally known as The Petroplex, akin to the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, is located along Interstate 20 in West Texas in a petroleum rich area called the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin extends into the South Plains region just south of Lubbock, Texas, extending westward into southeastern New Mexico."
Midland–Odessa enjoys a climate typical of the resort cities of the Southwest United States. The terrain type is described as semi-arid mesquite-mixed grassland subtropical steppe. Winters are typically mild with a few seasonable cold spells. In the spring the wind is quite strong and the summer can bring extended heat waves with many consecutive days with highs of 100 degrees or more. The average rainfall of Midland–Odessa is 14.96 inches. Midland–Odessa is located in zone 8 according to the USDA 2003 Plant Hardiness Map. On average the area experiences 316 days of sunshine a year.
"The Midland–Odessa, Texas, combined statistical area (CSA) is made up of two metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) encompassing three counties. The CSA includes Martin and Midland counties in the Midland MSA, and Ector County in the Odessa MSA. The Midland–Odessa CSA encompasses 2,720 sq mi (7,044 km) of area, of which 2,713 sq mi (7,027 km) is land and 6.6 sq mi (18 km) is water."
"As of the census of 2000, there were 237,132 people, 86,591 households, and 62,647 families residing within the CSA. The racial makeup of the CSA was 75.47% White, 5.77% African American, 0.74% Native American, 0.78% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 14.83% from other races, and 2.38% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 35.84% of the population."
"The median income for a household in the CSA was $35,117, and the median income for a family was $41,819. Males had a median income of $33,778 versus $23,013 for females. The per capita income for the CSA was $17,700."
"The economy of the area is heavily dependent on the petroleum industry and has experienced a series of booms and busts as the price of crude oil has fluctuated. The Permian Basin is the source of the New York Mercantile Exchange's benchmark West Texas Intermediate Crude. Traditionally, the core cities of Midland and Odessa have played very distinct roles in the petroleum industry. Midland is home to most of the corporate offices and has a predominantly white-collar population. Odessa by contrast is home to mostly blue-collar workers and industrial facilities. In 2003 Family Dollar constructed its seventh distribution center, in its industrial complex, since then Telvista, an incoming call center, and Coca-Cola Enterprises have relocated to this complex located on Interstate 20. In even-numbered years, Odessa hosts the Permian Basin International Oil Show—the world's largest inland petroleum exposition—at the Ector County Coliseum. In recent years, both cities have made efforts to diversify into additional industries to reduce their dependence on the petroleum industry. Midland–Odessa is well positioned to become an energy nexus for the region and for the United States as a whole. The metropolitan area is home to two major natural gas powerplants and in July 2006 it was announced that Odessa was one of four possible sites for a FutureGen zero-emissions coal-fired powerplant (which eventually was awarded to Mattoon, Illinois). The Permian Basin is also home to several windfarms and the city of Andrews is a candidate site for an experimental high temperature nuclear reactor. This focus on new sources of alternative energy in addition to petroleum has led some to refer to the Permian Basin as the Energy Basin. The recent high price of crude oil has led to a significant economic boom in the area."
"Midland–Odessa is served by Midland International Air and Space Port (MAF), located between the core cities in Terminal and has since been annexed into Midland proper. This airport serves as a regional hub for cities and towns throughout the Permian Basin and as a gateway to Big Bend National Park. Odessa Schlemeyer Airport and Midland Air Park also serve as an option for smaller jets."
"The spirit of cooperation can be seen in the Midland Odessa Transportation Alliance (MOTRAN) and its centerpiece project ""La Entrada al Pacifico"" or ""Entrance to the Pacific"". La Entrada al Pacifico is an official trade corridor that connects the Mexican port city of Topolobampo on the west coast of Mexico with major markets in the Eastern and North Eastern United States and includes an inland port facility to be located in Midland–Odessa."

"The 2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. The season included two very severe cyclonic storms, both in October, and one other named cyclonic storm, classified according to the tropical cyclone intensity scale of the India Meteorological Department. Cyclone Hudhud is estimated to have caused US$3.58 billion in damage across eastern India, and more than 120 deaths."
"The scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere, east of the Horn of Africa and west of the Malay Peninsula. There are two main seas in the North Indian Ocean — the Arabian Sea to the west of the Indian subcontinent, abbreviated ""ARB"" by the India Meteorological Department (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated ""BOB"" by the IMD. The official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre in this basin is the India Meteorological Department (IMD), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center releases unofficial advisories. On average, four to six storms form in this basin every season."
"Under the influence of an active intertropical convergence zone, the season got off to one of its earliest starts on record, with a depression developing over the Andaman Sea during January 4. Over the next couple of days the system moved westwards and made landfall on Sri Lanka, where it weakened into an area of low pressure. Over the next few months the basin remained quiet, before the precursor cyclonic circulation to Depression BOB 02 developed during May 18. As the cyclonic circulation developed it helped the southwest monsoon, advance into the Andaman Sea and parts of the Bay of Bengal, before it developed into a depression during May 21. The depression was short lived and weakened into a remnant low, over the Bay of Bengal during May 23. The southwest monsoon was subsequently delayed by six days setting in over the Indian state of Kerala and eventually moved over the state during June 6. Over the next few days the monsoon set in further over the Bay of Bengal, while it was enhanced over the Arabian Sea by the formation of Cyclonic Storm Nanauk. By June 18, the monsoon covered most of the North Indian Ocean and parts of Gujarat, Konkan & Goa, Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar and Gangetic West Bengal."
"During June 19, an eastward propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation over the maritime continent, lead to the season's first area of low pressure developing over coastal parts of Bangladesh. This helped the monsoon set in over India's north-eastern states and advance in to central India. During the final week of June the monsoon weakened, which led to the emergence of heatwave conditions over eastern parts of coastal India. The monsoon subsequently started to revive as it interacted with the mid-latitude westerlies and it advanced into parts of the Himalayas and northwest India by July 1. During the first week of July an area of low pressure and several upper air cyclonic circulations caused the monsoon to advance further, where it covered the whole of Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh by July 7. Over the next two weeks a trough of low pressure and a cyclonic circulation, helped advance the monsoon into remaining parts of the Arabian Sea, central and north-western India. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) subsequently declared that the monsoon covered the whole of India on July 17, which was about two days later that normal."
"A change in the lower tropospheric circulation pattern over Rajasthan between September 16–17, from cyclonic to anti cyclonic, which indicated to forecasters that the southwest monsoon had started to withdraw from the region. During September 23, after Rajasthan had remained mainly dry since September 17, the IMD declared that the withdrawal of the southwest monsoon had commenced. Over the next couple of weeks the monsoon gradually withdrew from the Arabian Sea, north-western and central parts of India, before Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Hudhud formed on October 7. After Hudhud had moved northwards and weakened into an area of low pressure, the southwest monsoon withdrew from the rest of India, Sri Lanka and the North Indian Ocean by October 18. During October 18, northeast monsoon rains over Tamil Nadu and neighbouring peninsular India commenced."
"Under the influence of an active Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), a low pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal on January 2, slowly organizing as it moved into a favorable environment. A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). On January 4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) commenced its advisories on the storm, designating it ""Depression BOB 01"", followed by the JTWC classifying the storm a tropical cyclone. The storm intensified a little further, before it made landfall over north Sri Lanka on January 6 and degenerating into a low pressure area during the following day."
"The storm brought moderate rainfall to northern Sri Lanka. On January 6, Vavuniya reported the highest amount of rainfall of , followed by Puttalam, Anuradhapura and Trincomalee receiving each. The depression was the first storm in the North Indian Ocean to form in the month of January since Cyclonic Storm Hibaru in 2005."
"A low pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal on May 19. It slowly consolidated, prompting IMD to classify it as a Depression on May 21, followed by JTWC issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) in the following hours. Over the following day, the depression continued moving north-northeastwards towards an area of high vertical wind shear. The JTWC cancelled the TCFA issued for the system, stating that high wind shear had caused the convection to start dissipating. The storm continued losing convection, until it weakened into a well-marked low pressure area on May 23. The remnant system persisted for several more days, moving over the Indian state of Odisha late on May 25, before dissipating on the following day."
"The depression brought much-needed relief to Odisha which had been suffering from a heat wave that claimed at least 22 lives. Coastal areas previously reporting temperatures near fell below during the system's passage. Heavy rains affected many areas, including at Bhawanipatna which experienced temperatures of days earlier. The highest 24‑hour rainfall was in Baleswar. Six districts were placed under a flood alert due to the rains. A bridge near Hatadahi in the Rayagada district was swept away by flooding."
"Under the influence of an active southwest monsoon surge, a low pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea on June 9. It slowly organized, and was classified tropical storm ""02A"" by the JTWC in the early hours of June 10. In the following hours, the IMD upgraded the storm to a depression and subsequently a deep depression, designating it ""ARB 01"". On June 11, the system was upgraded to Cyclonic Storm intensity and was named ""Nanauk"" by the IMD as it continued to intensify under favorable environmental conditions. The following day, Nanauk reached its peak intensity with a minimum central pressure of and 3-minute sustained winds of . As it tracked further northwestwards, the storm encountered moderate vertical wind shear, dry air and low sea surface temperatures, causing it to weaken rapidly into a Depression on June 13. A low-level steering flow deflected the storm to take a northward path, and the system was last noted as a well-marked low pressure area on June 14."
"On July 19, an upper level cyclonic circulation lay over the north-eastern Bay of Bengal and parts of Gangetic West Bengal and Odisha. Over the next day an area of low pressure formed, under the influence of this cyclonic circulation and rapidly concentrated into a Depression during July 21, over Odisha and West Bengal. Over the next couple of days the system moved westwards, before it weakened into an area of low pressure during July 23 over northwest Madhya Pradesh. The area of low pressure subsequently merged with the monsoon during July 25, while the cyclonic circulation persisted over Rajasthan and Punjab, before it was last noted during July 31. Under the influence of the depression, heavy to extremely heavy rainfall was recorded in the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Vidarbha. In Odisha a total of 12 people lost their lives, while around of crops were affected and 1351 houses were damaged."
"On 3 August, a low pressure area formed over the Bay of Bengal under the influence of an upper air cyclonic circulation. The system slowly intensified into a depression the following day while being located inland over Midnapore. The depression moved further inland, underwent intensification and was upgraded to a deep depression the same day. The storm moved further westwards and weakened into a depression on August 5, and was last noted as a well marked low pressure area on August 7 over northwestern Madhya Pradesh."
"The storm activated a flood situation in Odisha, affecting 12 districts of the state. Waterlogging was reported in the cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneshwar, and nearly 200 villages were affected after the Baitarani river swelled more than two meters over its flood danger level. Sambalpur district received the highest amount of rainfall at , followed by Balasore district receiving . Seven people were reported to be missing after two trawlers capsized off the coast. The state government evacuated about 17,000 people from low-lying areas. 23 deaths were reported due to torrential rainfall."
"Under the influence of an upper air cyclonic circulation, a low pressure area formed over the Andaman Sea on October 6. The system drifted westward and intensified into a depression and subsequently into a deep depression the next day, followed by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issuing a Tropical cyclone formation alert (TCFA). Owing to favorable environmental conditions, the storm intensified into a cyclonic storm on October 8 and was named ""Hudhud"". Its convection consolidated in the following hours, and Hudhud became a Severe Cyclonic Storm on October 9. Hudhud underwent rapid deepening in the following days, intensified into a Very severe cyclonic storm and developed a well-defined eye feature. Shortly before landfall near Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh on October 12, Hudhud reached its peak strength with three-minute wind speeds of and a minimum central pressure of . The system drifted northwards over land and was last noted as a well-marked low pressure area over east Uttar Pradesh on October 14."
"Hudhud brought extensive damage to the coastal districts of Andhra Pradesh. At least 124 deaths were reported due to the storm and damage amounted to 21,908 crore (US$3.58 billion)."
"In late October, a low pressure area formed over the Arabian Sea. It slowly consolidated and a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was issued by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on October 24. The following day, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified the storm as a depression, designating it ARB 02, and the JTWC estimated tropical storm winds at the storm's center, starting advisories for the system. On October 26, the system remained stationary and intensified into a Deep Depression. Subsequently, the IMD reported the storm had intensified into a cyclonic storm, and named it ""Nilofar"". The following day, the IMD upgraded the storm into a severe cyclonic storm and further to a very severe cyclonic storm, and the JTWC reported hurricane-strength winds at Nilofar's center as it meanwhile developed an eye feature. On October 28, Nilofar underwent rapid deepening throughout the day, reaching a peak strength of with wind speeds exceeding , tied with Hudhud. Over the following days, the storm recurved northeastwards and experienced high vertical wind shear, causing it to weaken rapidly into a minimal cyclonic storm on October 30. The low-level circulation center of the storm became exposed in the following hours and IMD downgraded the storm into a well-marked low pressure area on October 31, issuing its final advisory for the system."
"During November 3, an area of low pressure developed over the Bay of Bengal, under the influence of active northeast monsoon conditions. On November 5, the IMD identified the system as a depression and designated it with the identifier 'BOB 04'. This was followed by the JTWC issuing a TCFA and subsequently initiating advisories on the system. The JTWC designated it '05B' and was reporting winds around the center on November 6. Later that day, the IMD upgraded BOB 04 into a Deep Depression. The system drifted northwards over the next couple of days, maintaining its intensity. Located between two subtropical ridges, BOB 04 mostly showed quasi-stationary motion. However, albeit the adequately favorable conditions for further intensification, BOB 04 failed to intensify further. This resulted in the IMD downgrading the system into a Depression and further into an area of low pressure by November 8."
"This is a table of all storms in the 2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. It mentions all of the season's storms and their names, durations, peak intensities (according to the IMD storm scale), landfall(s) – denoted by bold location names – damages, and death totals.

= = = The Chase (American game show) = = =
"The Chase is an American television quiz show based on the British program of the same name. The show premiered on August 6, 2013, on Game Show Network (GSN). It is hosted by Brooke Burns, and features Mark Labbett (nicknamed ""The Beast"") as the ""chaser""."
"The American version of the show follows the same general format as the original UK version, but with teams of three contestants instead of four. The game is a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win money by challenging a quiz show genius known as the chaser. Each contestant participates in an individual ""chase"" called the Cash Builder, in which they attempt to answer as many questions as possible in 60 seconds to earn as much money as possible to contribute to a prize fund for the team. The contestant must answer enough questions to stay ahead of the chaser on the gameboard; otherwise, they lose their winnings for that round. The contestants who successfully complete their individual chases without being caught advance to the Final Chase, in which they answer questions as a team playing for an equal share of the prize fund accumulated throughout the episode."
"""The Chase"" received positive critical reception; Burns and Labbett earned positive reviews for their roles, and one critic praised the series for avoiding a slow pace in gameplay. Both the series and Burns received Daytime Emmy Award nominations; the series was nominated in 2014 for Outstanding Game Show, and Burns two years later for Outstanding Game Show Host. Each lost to ""Jeopardy!"" and Craig Ferguson (host of ""Celebrity Name Game"") respectively."
"Three new contestants compete on each episode as a team. In the first round, each contestant in turn wins money for their team by answering as many questions correctly as possible during a one-minute rapid-fire round, entitled the ""Cash Builder"". Each correct answer in this round adds $5,000 to the bank; during celebrity episodes, contestants start with $5,000 already in the bank. At the end of the Cash Builder, the contestant participates in a key element of the show called a ""chase"". In the chase, the chaser and the contestant each answer questions; the contestant starts with an advantage, and the chaser attempts to catch up. The contestant's goal is to answer enough questions correctly to move the earned winnings along the gameboard into the team bank without being caught by the chaser, whose job is to catch them by capitalizing on their mistakes."
"The chaser starts eight spaces away from the bank. The contestant has the option of starting five steps away from the bank, meaning that they must answer five questions correctly without being caught to bank the money and continue to the next round. Before the chase starts, the chaser will make two offers to the contestant: one offer will be to play for a lower amount, but start one step closer to the bank, meaning that they will have to answer one less question correctly; the other offer will be to play for a higher amount, but start one step further away from the bank. On rare occasions, if the contestant chooses the higher offer, the chaser may escalate the stakes by offering a ""super offer"" for an even higher amount. In this case, the contestant must answer seven questions correctly without being caught and thus start right in front of the chaser, meaning that the contestant needs to answer every question in that round correctly (assuming the chaser does so as well)."
"After the contestant decides for which amount to play, the prize money is displayed on the gameboard. The contestant and chaser are presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks in their answer, which cannot then be changed; the other has five seconds to answer after them; otherwise, they are locked out and do not advance on the gameboard. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money shown on the gameboard moves one step closer to the team bank. Similarly, the chaser moves one step closer to the contestant's prize money with each correct answer. Further questions are asked until the contestant reaches the end of the board (thus banking the prize money), or the chaser catches the contestant, eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant or the chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out by the time limit."
"After all three contestants have played a Cash Builder round followed by a chase, the contestants who were not caught by the chaser advance to the Final Chase, with the team bank set to the total that they won in their Cash Builder rounds. If all three contestants fail to win their individual chases, the team selects one contestant to play the Final Chase alone for a total of $15,000 ($5,000 per contestant). During celebrity episodes, contestants who are caught leave with $5,000 for their respective charities."
"The Final Chase is played on a gameboard. The team receives a head start of one space for each member who advanced to this round. During the commercial break, the team chooses between two sets of questions, labeled ""A"" and ""B"". The chaser plays the other set. The contestants have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. After a question is asked, answers must be instantaneous, and contestants are only permitted to respond or pass a question after first ringing in. If a contestant rings in but another contestant answers, the answer is treated as wrong even if it was correct. If there is only one contestant in the Final Chase, then he or she does not need to ring in. Each question answered correctly within the time limit moves the team one space ahead on the board."
"After time expires, the chaser is given two minutes to catch the team by correctly answering a new series of questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time expires, the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally."
"""The Chase"" originated in the United Kingdom, premiering on ITV in 2009. As the series became increasingly popular in the UK, Fox ordered two pilot episodes in April 2012 to be taped in London for consideration to be added to the network's U.S. programming lineup. Bradley Walsh, presenter of the British version, was featured as the show's host, while UK chaser Mark Labbett (nicknamed ""The Beast"", which is ""la bête"" in French) and ""Jeopardy!"" champion Brad Rutter were the chasers."
"After Fox passed up the opportunity to add the series to its lineup, Game Show Network (GSN), in conjunction with ITV Studios America, picked up the series with an eight-episode order on April 9, 2013, and announced Brooke Burns as the show's host and Labbett as the chaser on May 29. Dan Patrick had originally been considered as the host. The first season premiered on August 6, 2013. Even though the show had not yet premiered at the time, the network ordered a second season of eight episodes on July 1, 2013, which premiered on November 5. Citing the series' status as a ""ratings phenom"", GSN eventually announced plans to renew it for a third season, which premiered in the summer of 2014. During the third season, the series also premiered its first celebrity edition with celebrity contestants playing for charity. GSN proceeded to renew the series for a fourth season before the end of season three; this new season began airing January 27, 2015. After the seventh episode of the season, the series went on another hiatus; new episodes from the fourth season resumed airing July 16, 2015. No new episodes have aired since the season four finale, which aired December 11, 2015."
"""The Chase"" was generally well received by critics. Michael Tyminski of ""Manhattan Digest"" reviewed the series positively, calling it ""a breath of fresh air"" and praising Burns and Labbett in their respective roles. Tyminski added that while each question's level of difficulty is not always on par with those on other quiz shows such as ""Jeopardy!"", the show avoids a ""painfully slow pace."" Similarly, John Teti of ""The A.V. Club"" called the show a ""pretty good adaptation"" of its UK counterpart. While he preferred the British version of the show, saying that it had ""a more varied cast and stronger production values"", Teti felt that the American version ""still holds its own."" ""The Chase"" was also ranked ninth on Douglas Pucci's (of ""TV Media Insights"") list of best new television shows of 2013."
"""The Chase"" was one of two GSN originals (the other being ""The American Bible Challenge"") to be honored at the 41st Daytime Emmy Awards in 2014 with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Game Show; ""Jeopardy!"" was the eventual winner. Two years later, Burns received an Emmy nomination at the 43rd Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Game Show Host, losing to Craig Ferguson of ""Celebrity Name Game""."
"""The Chase"" became one of the highest rated original programs in GSN's history. The series debuted to 511,000 total viewers during its premiere while maintaining 90% of its audience with 461,000 total viewers during the second episode airing that night. On January 28, 2014, ""The Chase"" set a new series high for total viewers and adults 18–49, with 827,000 and 234,000 viewers respectively. Although the season three premiere fell in the ratings from its series high, earning 494,000 viewers with only 73,000 in the 18–49 demographic, the premiere of the fourth season saw a sizeable rise over the previous season's premiere, earning 749,000 total viewers."
"On December 18, 2013, Barnstorm Games released a mobile version of the game for iOS and Android. The only differences between the app and the show are that four choices are presented for questions in the Cash Builder and the Final Chase rounds and that no Final Chase is played if all players are caught in their individual chases. The app features Labbett (referred to by his ""Beast"" nickname) as a simulated chaser and can be played by up to four people."
= = = Canadian Observatory on Homelessness = = =
"The Canadian Observatory on Homelessness (COH)—formerly named the Canadian Homelessness Research Network (CHRN)—is a Canadian non-profit, non-partisan research institute that works with researchers, service providers, policy makers, students and people who have experienced homelessness."
"The COH focuses on the following areas: ""systems responses"" to homelessness; determining effective models of housing and support; Aboriginal homelessness; homelessness prevention; youth homelessness; legal and justice issues; measuring progress towards ending homelessness; knowledge mobilization and research impact."
"The organization’s website, the Homeless Hub, offers information on the causes of and solutions to homelessness."
"The CHRN was founded in 2008, through a 7-year Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) grant. Its goals were to enhance networking amongst stakeholders in the field and to mobilize homelessness research in Canada."
"Through a second SSHRC grant awarded in 2013, the CHRN was renamed the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness (COH). The COH continues the work of the CHRN and introduces a program of research that includes local, provincial and national monitoring activities, as well as original research that addresses key issues in homelessness. The current and founding Director is Dr. Stephen Gaetz, a professor at York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where the COH is also housed. Members of the COH include 28 academics from institutions across Canada, as well as 28 agencies and community organizations."
"In 2005 there was no consistent definition of homelessness. At the time, most research and programs focused on ""absolute homelessness"" and public policy initiatives."
"In 2012, the CHRN/COH released the Canadian definition of homelessness to create a common understanding when it comes to measuring homelessness in Canada, and identifying goals, interventions and strategies to address homelessness effectively. The CHRN’s definition of homelessness, which is closely based on the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion (ETHOS) definition, groups the homeless population into four categories: ""unsheltered"", ""emergency sheltered"", ""provisionally accommodated"" and ""at risk of homelessness."""
"The new definition received a lot of support and also faced some criticism. Since then, the Canadian definition of homelessness has been endorsed by 75 scholars and community organizations."
"The COH produces a number of resources to help service providers, researchers, policy makers etc., better understand and tackle the problem of homelessness."
"In collaboration with the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, the COH (then CHRN) released the State of Homelessness in Canada in 2013, what they call the first national report card on homelessness in Canada. The report card stated that 30,000 Canadians are homeless every day, 200,000 in any given year. The report’s authors urged policy-makers to do a better job of tracking homelessness and evaluating the effectiveness of their responses."
"In 2014, this report was updated to show that 235,000 Canadians experience homelessness every year, costing the economy $7 billion. According to the report, it would only take $46 more per Canadian to drastically reduce homelessness across the country."

= = = South Gippsland railway line = = =
"The South Gippsland railway line is a partially closed railway line in Victoria, Australia. It was first opened in 1892, branching from the Orbost line at Dandenong, and extending to Port Albert. Much of it (the section up to Leongatha) remained in use until July 1993. Today, only the section between Dandenong and Cranbourne remains open for use. The section of the line from Nyora to Leongatha was used by the South Gippsland Tourist Railway until it ceased operations in 2016. The section from Leongatha to Toora, and a portion of the former line at Koo Wee Rup, have been converted into the Great Southern Rail Trail."
"The Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company opened a line from Princes Bridge railway station to Punt Road (Richmond) and South Yarra in 1859 and extended to Dandenong in 1879. The South Gippsland railway line was opened from Dandenong to Cranbourne in 1888 and extended to Koo Wee Rup, Nyora and Loch in 1890, Korumburra and Leongatha in 1891 and Welshpool, Alberton and Port Albert in 1892. The section from Alberton to Port Albert was closed in the 1940s. A branch line was built from Alberton to Yarram and Woodside in 1921."
"The line was well known for its sharp curves and spectacular scenery and was also one of the last lines to offer a 'Mixed Passenger and Goods' service in Victoria. The section from Yarram to Woodside was closed on 26 May 1953, with the section from Welshpool to Yarram closed on 26 October 1987 when the superphosphate freight services ceased. From this point until 30 June 1992, the track beyond Agnes, referred to as Barry Beach Junction received minimal usage, although a short branch leading from Agnes to Barry Beach was used extensively for goods traffic to serve the oil platforms in Bass Strait. After the withdrawal of this freight service the railway line beyond Leongatha was booked out of use for all rail traffic. This section of track was then dismantled in 1994, in which required the strengthening of the line's derelict trestle bridges in order to allow the track removal machine to dismantle the tracks."
"On 24 July 1993, the last regular V/Line passenger train operated to Leongatha with P Class diesel locomotive number 18 hauling the return passenger train with a set of 4 H-Set carriages. Following the withdrawal of all rail service beyond Koala Siding, the section of track from Nyora to Leongatha was transferred to the South Gippsland Railway in 1994, The South Gippsland Railway was founded in 1990 as the ""Great Southern Railway Society"", based at Nyora, with the intention of preserving the line in case of closure. On 15 January 1998, all regular V/Line services ceased on the line after the withdrawal of the Australian Glass Manufacturing sand train, that operated between the sand mine at Koala Siding, situated between Lang Lang and Nyora railway stations, and the AGM siding at Spotswood. Since April 1998, no trains have operated beyond Cranbourne."
A 5 km-long narrow-gauge horse-drawn tramway was opened from Welshpool to Welshpool Jetty in 1905. It was closed in 1941.
"The mountainous Strzelecki branch line, which opened in 1922, was built from Koo Wee Rup to Strzelecki. The line was closed in stages throughout the 1930s, '40s and '50s."
"The Wonthaggi branch line was built from Nyora to Wonthaggi, opening in 1910, to serve the State Coal Mine, a small extension to the line was opened in 1917. The Wonthaggi line was closed in 1978."
"The Outtrim branch line was built from Korumburra to the coal mine at Outtrim in two stages: the initial stage to Jumbunna was opened in 1894, with the final section to Outtrim opening in 1896. The line was closed in two stages: the first from Jumbunna to Outtrim on 4 September 1951 and then from Jumbunna to Korumburra on 1 October 1953."
"Passenger services operated on the line from its opening. Services from Melbourne to Leongatha and Yarram were withdrawn on 6 June 1981, with replacement buses starting three days later. The Yarram train was a loco hauled train, while the Leongatha train was a DRC railcar hauling MTH carriages. To fill the gaps between those services, local trains were introduced on a three-month trial from Dandenong to Lang Lang, but were withdrawn on 3 October 1981, due to insufficient patronage. Services to Leongatha were restored on 9 December 1984, and free train shuttles to Korumburra were provided to mark the occasion. The 1984 timetable included two round trips per day from Monday to Saturday, and one round trip on Sundays. However, the services were again withdrawn on 24 July 1993. With the withdrawal of freight services from Koala siding in January 1998, the line became unused beyond Cranbourne. The exception was a tourist operation, which commenced operation between Nyora and Leongatha. It later became known as South Gippsland Railway. In 1995 the section between Dandenong and Cranbourne was electrified and a station added at Merinda Park, as part of a $27 million Federal Government-funded project."
"The Barry Beach freight service ceased in 1992. The line beyond Leongatha was booked out of service on 30 June 1992, effectively ending all traffic on the line beyond Leongatha. V/Line passenger services ceased to Leongatha on 24 July 1993, after last train to Melbourne. By the mid-1990s only T, Y and P class diesel locomotives were used on the line, due to their low axle loads, with a 15 km/h speed limit applying to parts of the track. This continued until 15 January 1998, when the Koala Siding (near Nyora) to Spotswood sand train ceased operation. On average, it took a passenger train 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel from Spencer Street station to Leongatha during the final 10 years of service, with the replacement bus service completing the journey in an average time of 2 hours and 30 minutes."
"A number of special railway enthusiast services were operated along the line during the 1980s and 1990s, given that the line was near closure. Notable special journeys included K.153 hauling the last steam special to Yarram on 24 October 1987, as well as an earlier Vintage Train journey to Foster and return on 6 September 1987. The last steam hauled train to run beyond Leongatha was on 13 November 1988, when steam locomotives D3.639 and K.153 travelled to Foster. That was the last time the locomotive turntable at Foster would be available for usage prior to its relocation to Korumburra railway station for the South Gippsland Tourist Railway in 1994. Local Melbourne community groups continued to organise chartered special diesel and railcar-hauled trains beyond Leongatha until 1991. A steam and diesel special to Barry Beach and Welshpool on 11 November 1989, which was organised to celebrate the 100th anniversary since the Dandenong to Nyora section of the Great Southern Railway Line opened. Heritage steam locomotive J515 hauled the special to Leongatha and return later one in the day while then V/Line diesel locomotive T368 took over for the section of track beyond Leongatha due to the turntable at Foster not being available for operation. D.E.R.M. 58 ran the last advertised special train available to the public beyond Leongatha to Welshpool and Barry Beach on May the 12th 1990."
"During the 1990s, steam tours only operated as far as Leongatha, with the first being run on 9 September 1990, again hauled by steam locomotive K.153, which coincided with the steam locomotive's 50th anniversary since being introduced into service. In 1993 there were two notable steam -hauled trips to Leongatha. Both specials were operated by Steamrail Victoria, and hauled 11-car consists of Victorian Railways E-Type and W-Type wooden carriages, which ran numerous shuttles between Korumburra and Leongatha stations. The first one was on 2 May, which was supposed to be a triple header of K Class steam locomotives. However, one of the scheduled locomotives, K190, suffered a defective main internal steampipe failure at Caulfield, leaving locomotives K153 and K183 to double-head the train. On 25 July 1993, the apparent ""Last Lament to Leongatha"" was run, operated by K190 and K183."
"After the withdrawal of passenger services to Leongatha, a few more steam-hauled trips were organised before the line was booked out of regular use between Cranbourne and Nyora. On 17 April 1994, K190 and K183 again travelled to Leongatha with the ""South Gippsland Rambler"", with a consist of seven wooden carriages. Steam locomotive J515 journeyed to Leongatha on 14 October 1995, for the first time since November 1989, organised by the Seymour Railway Heritage Centre and the ARHS. During the tour, J515 derailed due to a missing guide rail on the locomotive turntable at Korumburra that had been recently relocated from Foster."
"The last locomotive to traverse the South Gippsland main line before its closure was steam locomotive K190 operated by Steamrail Victoria. It returned to Steamrail Victoria's base at Newport on 29 April 1998, after it was leased to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway (SGTR) in December 1996. The South Gippsland Tourist Railway had first loaned the locomotive during the summer of 1995-1996. The locomotive again returned for the summer of 1996-1997. K190 was leased to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway on 7 December 1996, when Steamrail Victoria operated another steam special to Leongatha. Diesel loco T345 was also loaned to the tourist railway at the time, and was part of the train from Newport workshops. K183 double-headed with K190 to Nyora, with T345 attached to the special. K190 and T345 were detached at Nyora station. Shortly afterwards K183 journeyed solo to Leongatha. K190 followed to Leongatha with a consist of the tourist railway's carriages. T342, T345 and the DERM RM55 combined for a Saturday tourist railway service. Later, K183 returned to Newport Workshops with the Steamrail Victoria train. However, steam locomotives D3639 and K183 combined for the last steam excursion to traverse the South Gippsland rail line on 25 September 1997. During this time D3.639, along with K190, were both on loan to the South Gippsland Tourist Railway."
"The track beyond Leongatha, to Yarram and the Barry Beach branch line, was dismantled in 1994, but removal of other infrastructure, such as level crossing signals, took place around mid to late 1992, soon after the last train ran to Barry Beach. The section between Leongatha and Foster was turned into the Great Southern Rail Trail in 1998. In 2011, the Tarra Rail Trail from Alberton to Yarram was completed. , the section between Foster and Toora had been complete, leaving the final section from there to Alberton being converted into the Great Southern Rail Trail."
"The section from Dandenong to Cranbourne was electrified in 1995 and, as the Cranbourne Line, is now part of the Melbourne suburban rail network. The first level crossing on the closed section of the line, the South Gippsland Highway crossing in Cranbourne has since been paved over. The Victorian Transport Plan of 2009 stated that the Cranbourne line would be extended two kilometres to a new station at Cranbourne East by 2015. The new Cranbourne East station would be built near Renyard Street and the Casey Fields complex. The line from Nyora to Leongatha was used by the South Gippsland Tourist Railway until 2016. The branch line from Nyora to Wonthaggi was closed in 1978 and dismantled by 1990. It is now the Bass Coast Rail Trail. Since its closure, a significant section of the former Wonthaggi Line has been leased or sold to farmers, while other sections have been cut away to widen highways and main roads in the coastal South Gippsland region. The former branch lines to both Outtrim and Strezlecki have become a distant memory."
"The remaining section of track from Cranbourne to Nyora is disused but mostly still intact. A length of track was pulled up at Koo Wee Rup in 2009 to allow the construction of toilets for the bus and coach stop. Construction of the pipeline for Wonthaggi Desalination Plant made it necessary to remove three sections of the line. The first is about 100 metres on the down side of Monomeith Road, where about 50 metres of track were removed. The second is on the up side of Caldermeade Road, where about thirty metres of track were removed, and the third is about halfway between Caldermeade and Lang Lang stations."
"Much of the operational and safeworking infrastructure remains in place in this section, including signalling equipment, level crossings, and easements. Station platforms are also in place, but mostly without station buildings, for example at Lang Lang, Koo-Wee-Rup, and Tooradin. Parts of the track have warped due to erosion, ground movement or the displacement of sleepers. This is especially evident near Lang Lang, Tooradin, and north of Koo-Wee-Rup. There are also questions about the integrity of some bridges and culverts along the route."
"Prior to the 1999 Victorian election, the state Labor Party promised to return passenger services to Leongatha. In 2008, a report commissioned by the Victorian Department of Transport found the cost of returning passenger services to Leongatha to be unjustifiably high, estimating the cost at $72 million. The report stated that only 20 per cent of respondents surveyed about their transport needs considered restoring train services to be the main priority. Instead $14.7 million was allocated to road coach service upgrades. The then Minister for Public Transport Lynne Kosky said that the State Government had provided funding for development of a rail trail between Cranbourne East and Nyora to support tourism in South Gippsland in May 2008."
"On February 24, 2016 South Gippsland Shire Council unanimously carried motions to support the return of rail services to Leongatha on the back of a petition initiated by the South & West Gippsland Transport Group, which attracted 2,420 supporters. The successful motion means that the data gathered from the petition and documents prepared by South Gippsland Shire Council investigating the returning rail to South Gippsland have now been passed onto Public Transport Victoria with a call to provide for South Gippsland rail services in the forthcoming Regional Network Development Plan. After the disbandment of the South Gippsland Tourist Railway on January 16, 2016 it had also been announced that VicTrack will continue to leave the disused rail line between Cranbourne and Leongatha intact and available for future use by freight and passenger trains."
"Reopening the South Gippsland railway line as far as Leongatha continues to be a prominent issue in the region. A South Gippsland Shire Council Priority Projects document, released in June 2013, acknowledged that the return of a rail service was a major community priority, with funding and support sought from all levels of government. In early 2014, a report into possible extensions of the Melbourne metropolitan rail system identified the population growth corridor from Cranbourne to Koo-Wee-Rup, along the disused Leongatha line, as a key planning priority. The South and West Gippsland Transport Group, a public transport and rail lobby group, established in April 2011, which is closely associated with the South Gippsland Shire Council and other local government bodies, has campaigned for an integrated transport plan in the region, which includes rail at the forefront of the proposal. The group had been known as the South Gippsland Transport Users Group and had amalgamated with numerous rail lobby groups in 1994 shortly after the rail passenger service to Leongatha was withdrawn in July 1993. One notable milestone for the group was running a successful campaign that saw passenger rail services reinstated to Leongatha on December 9, 1984. Despite the promise to revive the railway line for freight and passenger services by the Bracks Labor government in 1999 being abandoned by his successor John Brumby in 2008, a community campaign involving the South and West Gippsland Transport Group continued to lobby, in collaboration with key stakeholders and governments, to achieve the reinstatement of rail services, and the improvement of transport accessibility in the region."
= = = Round-tripping (finance) = = =
"Round-tripping, also known as round-trip transactions or ""Lazy Susans"", is defined by ""The Wall Street Journal"" as a form of barter that involves a company selling ""an unused asset to another company, while at the same time agreeing to buy back the same or similar assets at about the same price."" Swapping assets on a round-trip produces no net economic substance, but may be fraudulently reported as a series of productive sales and beneficial purchases on the books of the companies involved, violating the substance over form accounting principle. The companies appear to be growing and very ""busy"", but the round-tripping ""business"" does not generate profits. Growth is an attractive factor to speculative investors, even if profits are lacking; such investment benefits companies and motivates them to undertake the illusory growth of round-tripping."

"Nicholas Theodore Nemeth (born July 27, 1980) is an American professional wrestler and stand-up comedian. He is currently signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand under the ring name Dolph Ziggler."
"After a prolific career in amateur wrestling, where he established several school records for Kent State University, Nemeth signed a developmental contract with WWE in 2004 and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he wrestled under his real name. He was promoted to WWE's Raw brand shortly afterwards in 2005, playing the caddy sidekick to Kerwin White. He was sent back to OVW shortly afterwards, being given the name Nicky and joining the cheerleading-themed Spirit Squad, who debuted on ""Raw"" in January 2006 and won the World Tag Team Championship once before returning to OVW that November. In September 2007, Nemeth was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), where he won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship twice, with Brad Allen and later Gavin Spears."
"Upon his return to the main roster in September 2008, Nemeth was repackaged as Dolph Ziggler. Since then, he has held the World Heavyweight Championship twice, the Intercontinental Championship six times, the United States Championship twice, and the Raw Tag Team Championship twice. His other accomplishments include becoming the sole survivor of two Survivor Series elimination matches and the 2012 Money in the Bank winner as well as headlining multiple WWE pay-per-view events."
"Nicholas Theodore Nemeth was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 27, 1980. He has been a fan of professional wrestling since he was five years old, when he attended a wrestling event at the Richfield Coliseum, and he decided to become a professional wrestler at age 12. He later revealed on Colt Cabana's ""Art of Wrestling Podcast"" that he chose his WWE name ""Dolph"" because that was his great-grandfather's name, and his friend suggested the surname ""Ziggler"". Nemeth attended St. Edward High School in Lakewood, Ohio, where he was an amateur wrestler and holds the school record for most pins in a career with 82. At St. Edward, he was teammates with Gray Maynard and Andy Hrovat."
"During his time at St. Edward, the wrestling team won the National Championships on two occasions. He was a collegiate wrestler at Kent State University, eventually setting what was then the record for most career wins in the team's history. His record was passed in 2006; as of 2010, he stands second all-time in career victories at Kent State. He had 121 career wins between 2000 and 2003. He majored in political science with a pre-law minor. Prior to his WWE tryout, he had been accepted to the law school at Arizona State University, where he was due to start his first semester. Nemeth won championships in three consecutive years. He was a three-time All-Mid-American Conference champion, winning the tournament in 2000, 2002, and 2003; as of 2010, he is the last wrestler from Kent State University to have won three amateur wrestling championships."
"Nemeth signed a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2004. He was assigned to their developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), debuting as ""Nick Nemeth"". He feuded with Paul Burchill and challenged unsuccessfully for the OVW Television Championship, losing a championship match against then-champion Ken Doane on August 12, 2005."
"Nemeth was called up to the Raw roster shortly afterwards, making his television debut on the September 19, 2005, episode of ""Sunday Night Heat"". He was made the enforcer and sidekick for Chavo Guerrero, Jr., who was using a golfer in-ring persona and going by the ring name of ""Kerwin White"". As such, Nemeth became White's caddy. His wrestling debut came on an episode of ""Sunday Night Heat"", teaming up with White in a tag team match against Shelton Benjamin and Matt Striker. After the death of Eddie Guerrero, Chavo Guerrero dropped the ""Kerwin White"" character, and Nemeth no longer played the role of his caddy and tag partner. After a few months of wrestling in dark matches and at house shows, he was sent back to OVW."
"Nemeth became a part of The Spirit Squad faction, a group of five wrestlers who used the in-ring personas of male cheerleaders, and adopted the name Nicky in OVW during late 2005. The Spirit Squad members trained with real cheerleaders and gymnasts to ensure their characters were believable. On January 23, 2006, they had their WWE television debut as a group, appearing on ""Raw"" and helping Jonathan Coachman win a Royal Rumble qualifying match against Jerry ""The King"" Lawler by performing cheers for Coachman and distracting Lawler. They later became a part of the ongoing scripted feud between WWE chairman Vince McMahon and Shawn Michaels. The heel McMahon brought in the Squad to attack Michaels on numerous occasions, including placing them in multiple handicap matches."
"They also wrestled in the tag team division, and on April 3, on ""Raw"", won the World Tag Team Championship when Kenny and Mikey, with outside help from the other three Squad members, defeated Big Show and Kane. After winning the championship, all five members of the Spirit Squad were recognized as the champions, allowing any combination of them to defend the championship under the Freebird Rule."
"In May, McMahon signed another Handicap match, with the Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The match never started, however; instead the Spirit Squad attacked Michaels, and, as part of the storyline, shattered his knee with a steel chair. McMahon brought Triple H to the ring to attack Michaels with a sledgehammer; however, after Triple H felt that the Squad had disrespected him, he attacked the group. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with the Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on the Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating the Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at ""Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII""."
"At the same time as their feud with DX and their alignment with McMahon, the Squad also wrestled other teams in ""Raw""<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tag division over their World Tag Team Championship, successfully defending the championship against the teams of Jim Duggan and Eugene, Charlie Haas and Viscera, and Snitsky and Val Venis. They then entered a lengthy feud with The Highlanders, whom they eventually defeated to retain the championship at the Unforgiven pay-per-view in September. The Squad as a whole later began a losing streak with separate members losing singles matches to Ric Flair on consecutive episodes of ""Raw"", until Kenny managed to defeat him on the October 23 episode. It was then announced that Flair and a WWE legend, selected by interactive voting, would wrestle the team for the World Tag Team Championship at the Cyber Sunday pay-per-view in early November. The fans chose Roddy Piper, and he and Flair defeated Kenny and Mikey to win the championship."
"The group disbanded on the November 27 episode of ""Raw"", when they were defeated in a five-on-three handicap match by DX and Flair. In a backstage segment later that night, DX placed all members into a crate stamped ""OVW, Louisville, Kentucky"", a reference to the developmental territory from which the Squad had come."
"Nemeth returned to OVW on January 17, 2007, at the television tapings, again using his Nick Nemeth ring name, along with Mike Mondo, formerly Mikey in the Spirit Squad, as the ""Frat Pack"". The pair teamed with Mike Kruel in a match against Seth Skyfire, Shawn Spears, and Cody Runnels. The team disbanded in the early parts of 2007. Nemeth then competed in several dark matches before the OVW television tapings, competing against several wrestlers including Chris Cage, Bradley Jay and Jake Hager, before he began teaming with Mondo again in August."
"At the end of August, Nemeth and Mike Mondo were moved to the Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) developmental territory and in his debut there, Nemeth gained the nickname ""The Natural"" and defeated Hade Vansen. In November 2007, Nemeth gained Big Rob as his manager, but their alliance was short-lived. At the start of 2008, he tweaked his name to ""Nic Nemeth"" and began teaming with Brad Allen, with the pair gaining Taryn Terrell as their valet. Nemeth and Allen started a frat boy type ring character with Terrell as a sorority girl. On March 22, Nemeth and Allen won the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship by defeating defending champions Eddie Colón and Eric Pérez, but lost the championship to Colón and Pérez on April 15. Throughout April and May 2008, Nemeth wrestled in several dark matches prior to ""Raw"", losing to Kofi Kingston and Ron Killings on several occasions. Soon after, he returned to the name ""Nic Nemeth"", and began teaming with Gavin Spears. The pair defeated Colón and Pérez to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship on August 16, but lost it to Heath Miller and Joe Hennig less than a month later."
"On September 15, 2008, Nemeth re-debuted on ""Raw"" (as a heel), introducing himself in a backstage segment under the name ""Dolph Ziggler"". On October 10, Nemeth was suspended for 30 days for a violation of WWE's Wellness Program policy. He returned to ""Raw"" on November 17 in a backstage segment with Rey Mysterio and Shawn Michaels. In his first match on ""Raw"" under the Ziggler name, he lost to Batista on the December 1, 2008 episode. The following week he got his first victory as Ziggler, by countout, against R-Truth. The next week on ""Raw"", he picked up his first televised pinfall victory, when he defeated Charlie Haas. Ziggler would compete in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, in which he was eliminated by Kane after 21 seconds."
"On April 15, 2009, Ziggler was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He made his debut on the April 17 episode of ""SmackDown"", defeating the United States Champion, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a non-title match, and, as a result, the following week he demanded a match for the championship. On the May 1 episode of ""SmackDown"", however, he failed to win the championship, after he was pinned by MVP. Ziggler then started a rivalry with The Great Khali, losing to him by disqualification after attacking Khali with a steel chair. As a result, Khali began coming out to the ring during and after Ziggler's matches, in attempt to gain revenge and to stop Ziggler from cheating. Over the next few weeks, Ziggler would defeat Khali by countout and disqualification after making it look like Khali had struck him with a steel chair. At The Bash pay-per-view, Ziggler defeated Khali in a No Disqualification match by pinfall, after Kane interfered and attacked Khali."
"Ziggler then entered an on-screen relationship with WWE Diva Maria and she became his valet. He simultaneously started a scripted rivalry with Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio, who defeated Ziggler at the Night of Champions and SummerSlam pay-per-views to retain the championship. In September, Mysterio lost the Intercontinental Championship to John Morrison, and Ziggler entered a feud with Morrison after defeating him by countout in a non-title match, but lost to him at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view. On the episode of ""SmackDown"" following Hell in a Cell, Ziggler ended his on-screen relationship with Maria after she accidentally cost him a match against Morrison for the Intercontinental Championship. He again failed to win the Intercontinental title from Morrison twice, wrestling him to a double countout on the November 13 episode of ""SmackDown"" and losing a two-out-of-three falls match the following week to end the feud. On the February 26, 2010, episode of ""SmackDown"", Ziggler defeated John Morrison and R-Truth in a triple threat qualifying match to compete in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXVI, but was ultimately unsuccessful."
"In June 2010, he began a romantic storyline with Vickie Guerrero, who began accompanying him to the ring. On the July 9 episode of ""SmackDown"", Ziggler defeated Chavo Guerrero and Montel Vontavious Porter in a triple threat match to qualify for the SmackDown Money in the Bank ladder match at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, where he once again failed to win the match. On July 28 at the tapings of the August 6 episode of ""SmackDown"" Ziggler defeated Kofi Kingston to win the WWE Intercontinental Championship for the first time. In his first title defense at SummerSlam, he retained the championship against Kingston when the match ended in a no contest due to interference from The Nexus. Ziggler was able to make a successful title defense against Kingston at the Night of Champions pay-per-view, and against Kaval at Survivor Series."
"In November 2010, Ziggler was chosen a Pro for the fourth season of ""NXT"", with Jacob Novak as his Rookie. On the January 4, 2011, episode of ""NXT"", Ziggler won a battle royal to earn the right to choose a new rookie, and chose Byron Saxton. His original rookie, Novak, was the first rookie eliminated later that night. On February 8, 2011, Ziggler's second rookie, Byron Saxton, was also voted off of ""NXT""."
"Ziggler successfully retained the Intercontinental Championship at in a three-way ladder match against Kingston and Jack Swagger, but lost the title to Kingston at ""SmackDown"" on January 4, ending a five-month reign at 160 days. That same night, Ziggler won a four-way match against Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre and The Big Show to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Ziggler was unsuccessful in his title match against Edge. On February 4, Ziggler's storyline girlfriend Vickie Guerrero, who was the acting General Manager of SmackDown, banned the spear – Edge's finishing move – and decided that if Edge used it, Ziggler would be awarded the championship. Ziggler was again defeated by Edge in a rematch on the February 11 episode of ""SmackDown"", but because Edge used the spear, Guerrero declared Ziggler the new champion on the February 14 episode of ""Raw"". Prior to Ziggler's official coronation ceremony on ""SmackDown"" on February 18, Guerrero also fired Edge, claiming that he had attacked SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long several weeks prior. However, Long interrupted Ziggler's ceremony and accused Guerrero of orchestrating the attack, prompting Guerrero to reveal Ziggler as the attacker and Long to rehire Edge. Long also gave Edge a rematch against Ziggler, who lost the championship back to Edge and was then fired by Long."
"On the March 7 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler was introduced as the newest member of the Raw roster, and defeated John Morrison in a singles match; Ziggler was accompanied by Guerrero, who had also been fired from ""SmackDown"", but she was forced to earn her spot on the Raw roster. Ziggler, along with Guerrero, and LayCool then feuded with Morrison, Trish Stratus, and ""Jersey Shore"" guest star Snooki, culminating in a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania XXVII which Ziggler and his team lost. On the April 18 episode of ""Raw"", Vickie introduced the ""new and improved"" Ziggler, who came out with his hair cut short and brown and went on to defeat Evan Bourne in a singles match. Ziggler had re-bleached his hair by the May 23 episode of ""Raw""."
"Ziggler beat United States Champion Kofi Kingston in a non-title match on the May 30 episode of ""Raw"", leading to a championship match at Capitol Punishment which Ziggler won to earn his first United States Championship. The next night on ""Raw"", Kingston invoked his rematch clause in a two out of three falls match and won via disqualification, allowing Ziggler to retain. After Jack Swagger suggested to Guerrero that she should manage him in addition to Ziggler, a jealous Ziggler teased tension with Swagger. This, coupled with Ziggler's concurrent feud with Alex Riley, led Ziggler to defend and retain his United States Championship in a fatal four-way match against Swagger, Riley, and John Morrison at Night of Champions. On the September 19 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler lost a non-title match to Zack Ryder when guest star Hugh Jackman helped Ryder by punching Ziggler in the face. Although Ziggler later claimed to have a broken jaw due to Jackman's punch, it was reported that the supposed injury was fake. Later that night, Guerrero officially began managing Swagger, and Swagger began interfering in Ziggler's matches to help him win. Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Air Boom for the WWE Tag Team Championship at Hell in a Cell and at Vengeance, where Ziggler also successfully defended the United States Championship against Ryder. He went on to successfully defend the championship against Morrison at Survivor Series. At , Ziggler lost the United States Championship to Ryder."
"On the December 26 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler defeated WWE Champion CM Punk in a gauntlet match for a championship opportunity following interference from John Laurinaitis. The following ""Raw"", Ziggler defeated Punk by countout after Laurinaitis interfered again; as a result, Ziggler did not win the championship. At the 2012 Royal Rumble pay-per-view, Ziggler failed to capture the WWE Championship from CM Punk. At the Elimination Chamber, Ziggler failed again to capture the WWE Championship after being eliminated second by Chris Jericho. Nemeth noted to Arda Ocal in an interview for The Score Television Network that the Elimination Chamber left him with multiple minor injuries and it is a match he least looked forward to working."
"On the February 27 ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Primo & Epico for the WWE Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat tag team match, also involving Kofi Kingston and R-Truth. On the March 19 ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger were announced as the newest members of Team Johnny for the 12-man tag team match at WrestleMania XXVIII and on the April 2 ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Santino Marella for the United States Championship in a triple threat match. After the match, Ziggler began a feud with Brodus Clay, who attacked Ziggler with a headbutt after he and Swagger tried to attack Marella. On the following episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler and Swagger were defeated by Clay and Marella in a tag team match. In the following weeks, Ziggler and Swagger lost to Clay and Hornswoggle in singles and tag matches. At Extreme Rules, Ziggler was again defeated by Clay. In May, Ziggler and Swagger unsuccessfully challenged Kofi Kingston and R-Truth for WWE Tag Team Championship, first at Over the Limit and second on the May 28 episode of ""Raw"", resulting in Ziggler showing signs of wanting to break away from Guerrero and Swagger."
"On the June 11 episode of ""Raw"", Ziggler defeated The Great Khali, Swagger and Christian in a fatal four-way elimination match to become the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship, but at No Way Out, Ziggler lost the title match to champion Sheamus. On the following ""Raw"", Guerrero, finally tired of the bickering between Ziggler and Swagger, arranged for a match between them; Ziggler won the match and Guerrero's affections. Ziggler received another shot at the World title on the June 29 ""SmackDown"", but was again defeated by Sheamus in a triple threat match, also involving Alberto Del Rio."
"Bakers closed his practice in 1841, and moved his family west to settle in Evansville, Indiana. He opened a new law office there, and took an interest in the city's civics. In 1845 he ran as the Whig candidate for representative of Vanderburgh County in the Indiana House of Representatives. He served one one-year term before returning to his practice. He was elected to serve on a county court in 1852 but resigned in 1854. His brother, William Baker, had also become active in the local politics, and served four terms as major of Evansville during the same time period."
"Baker was outspokenly anti-slavery, and following the break-up of the Whig party, he joined the newly formed Republican Party in 1854. At the state convention in 1856, he was nominated to run as lieutenant governor on the ticket with Oliver Morton a governor. The election was one of the most divisive in state history, with both sides making scathing attacks on the other. Despite the party's merger with several other third parties, the Republicans lost the election and Baker returned to his law practice in Evansville."
"Baker's wife, Matilda died in 1855, and Baker remarried in 1858 to Charlotte Frances Chute. The couple had two daughters and one son. He was in Evansville when the American Civil War began, and was part of a large crowd that gathered to discuss the event. He took the podium and delivered a speech calling on the crowd to take an oath of allegiance to the Union, which was administered by his brother, the Mayor. He then called on all the able-bodied men to follow him to war. Baker and his brother began actively recruiting a full regiment of men to serve in the war, and he was promoted to serve as Colonel of the 1st Regiment Indiana Cavalry."
"Baker led his regiment in defensive and garrison duty across the western theater of the war, and remained in regular communication with Governor Oliver Morton, who has become governor a few months earlier. Baker was most involved in coordinating supplies, and became a valuable organizer. Morton soon promoted him to serve as provost marshal of the state, and ordered him to return to Indianapolis to oversee operations. There he oversaw the formation of dozens of state regiments, tens of thousand of men, the shipment of tons of supplies, the distributions of weapons, and the management of the state arsenal."
"Baker left the army in 1864 to run again as Lieutenant Governor on the ticket with Oliver Morton and was elected with a 20,000-vote majority. Morton took a period of poor health in 1865 after suffering a paralytic stroke. He continued his duties briefly, but decided to attempt to seek a cure to the paralysis. He left the state and left Baker to serve as acting governor for five months until his health recovered. When Morton was elected to the Senate in 1866, Baker succeeded him as governor. While completing Morton's term, he began to advocate school reform. His primary goal was to improve the quality of teachers, which he sought to do by creating incentives to encourage teachers to consider their job as a permanent career. At that time, teaching was considered a temporary position by most teachers, until they could find a superior job elsewhere. The General Assembly accepted his plan and passed legislation to enact it."
"In 1868, Baker was reelected to the position of governor, defeating Thomas Hendricks by 961 votes, the closest in state history. During his administration, a women's prison was built, and a soldiers' home to assist the returning veterans and the Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute were constructed. Other school institutions were built during his term using federal funding provided by the land-grant system. Along with private donations, the money was used to start Purdue University. Baker signed the law to create the school in 1869, and it opened just after his term ended. Another of Baker's acts as governor was to establish the governor's portrait collection. The assembly agreed to spend up to $200 per portrait for the creation of the collection. Baker then hired painters and sought out the families of the former governors to procure photos and paintings from which official portraits could be created."
"Baker's most difficult goal to achieve was the ratification of the post-war amendments that, among other things, banned slavery and granted blacks the right to vote. His advocacy on the issues though managed to secure each of their ratifications, with the fourteenth amendment being the last ratified in 1869. The Democrats had resigned office ""en masse"" when the bill was put up for a vote to deny quorum, but the Republicans went ahead to approve the amendment. When the Democrats took the legislature in the following election, they revoked the ratification of the amendments, but it was too late and the federal government, which was Republican-dominated at the time, had already added them to the constitution."
"After Baker's term as governor expired he retired from public office and reopened his law office. His new partner was his former political opponent, Thomas Hendricks. After Hendricks was elected governor in 1872, Baker took on state attorney general Oscar B. Hord and Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court Samuel Perkins as partners. The law firm was passed on to Baker's son, and has since became one of the leading law firms in the United States, Baker & Daniels LLP."
"Baker remained active in public affairs and urged the state schools to grant equal opportunities. He became fairly active in the woman's suffrage movement and delivered an address to one of their meetings. He died on April 28, 1885, and was buried in Evansville, Indiana."

= = = Soil compaction = = =
"In geotechnical engineering, soil compaction is the process in which stress is applied to a soil causes densification as air is displaced from the pores between the soil grains. When stress is applied that causes densification due to water (or other liquid) being displaced from between the soil grains, then consolidation, not compaction, has occurred. Normally, compaction is the result of heavy machinery compressing the soil, but it can also occur due to the passage of (e.g.) animal feet."
"In soil science and agronomy, soil compaction is usually a combination of both engineering compaction and consolidation, so may occur due to a lack of water in the soil, the applied stress being internal suction due to water evaporation as well as due to passage of animal feet. Affected soils become less able to absorb rainfall, thus increasing runoff and erosion. Plants have difficulty in compacted soil because the mineral grains are pressed together, leaving little space for air and water, which are essential for root growth. Burrowing animals also find it a hostile environment, because the denser soil is more difficult to penetrate. The ability of a soil to recover from this type of compaction depends on climate, mineralogy and fauna. Soils with high shrink-swell capacity, such as vertisols, recover quickly from compaction where moisture conditions are variable (dry spells shrink the soil, causing it to crack). But clays such as kaolinite, which do not crack as they dry, cannot recover from compaction on their own unless they host ground-dwelling animals such as earthworms — the Cecil soil series is an example."
"Before soils can be compacted in the field, some laboratory tests are required to determine their engineering properties. Among various properties, the maximum dry density and the optimum moisture content are vital and specify the required density to be compacted in the field."
"Soil compaction is a vital part of the construction process. It is used for support of structural entities such as building foundations, roadways, walkways, and earth retaining structures to name a few. For a given soil type certain properties may deem it more or less desirable to perform adequately for a particular circumstance. In general, the preselected soil should have adequate strength, be relatively incompressible so that future settlement is not significant, be stable against volume change as water content or other factors vary, be durable and safe against deterioration, and possess proper permeability."
"When an area is to be filled or backfilled the soil is placed in layers called lifts. The ability of the first fill layers to be properly compacted will depend on the condition of the natural material being covered. If unsuitable material is left in place and backfilled, it may compress over a long period under the weight of the earth fill, causing settlement cracks in the fill or in any structure supported by the fill. In order to determine if the natural soil will support the first fill layers, an area can be proofrolled. Proofrolling consists of utilizing a piece heavy construction equipment (typically, heavy compaction equipment or hauling equipment) to roll across the fill site and watching for deflections to be revealed. These areas will be indicated by the development of rutting, pumping, or ground weaving."
"To ensure adequate soil compaction is achieved, project specifications will indicate the required soil density or degree of compaction that must be achieved. These specifications are generally recommended by a geotechnical engineer in a geotechnical engineering report."
"The soil type - that is, grain-size distributions, shape of the soil grains, specific gravity of soil solids, and amount and type of clay minerals, present - has a great influence on the maximum dry unit weight and optimum moisture content. It also has a great influence on how the materials should be compacted in given situations. Compaction is accomplished by use of heavy equipment. In sands and gravels, the equipment usually vibrates, to cause re-orientation of the soil particles into a denser configuration. In silts and clays, a sheepsfoot roller is frequently used, to create small zones of intense shearing, which drives air out of the soil."
"Determination of adequate compaction is done by determining the in-situ density of the soil and comparing it to the maximum density determined by a laboratory test. The most commonly used laboratory test is called the Proctor compaction test and there are two different methods in obtaining the maximum density. They are the standard Proctor and modified Proctor tests; the modified Proctor is more commonly used. For small dams, the standard Proctor may still be the reference."
"While soil under structures and pavements needs to be compacted, it is important after construction to decompact areas to be landscaped so that vegetation can grow."
"There are several means of achieving compaction of a material. Some are more appropriate for soil compaction than others, while some techniques are only suitable for particular soils or soils in particular conditions. Some are more suited to compaction of non-soil materials such as asphalt. Generally, those that can apply significant amounts of shear as well as compressive stress, are most effective."
The available techniques can be classified as:
The construction plant available to achieve compaction is extremely varied and is described elsewhere.
"Soil compactors are used to perform test methods which cover laboratory compaction methods used to determine the relationship between molding water content and dry unit weight of soils. Soil placed as engineering fill is compacted to a dense state to obtain satisfactory engineering properties such as, shear strength, compressibility, or permeability. In addition, foundation soils are often compacted to improve their engineering properties. Laboratory compaction tests provide the basis for determining the percent compaction and molding water content needed to achieve the required engineering properties, and for controlling construction to assure that the required compaction and water contents are achieved. Test methods such as EN 13286-2, EN 13286-47, ASTM D698, ASTM D1557, AASHTO T99, AASHTO T180, AASHTO T193, BS 1377:4 provide soil compaction testing procedures."

"Landstinget was the upper house of the Rigsdag (the parliament of Denmark), from 1849 until 1953, when the bicameral system was abolished in favor of unicameralism. Landstinget had powers equal to the Folketing, which made the two houses of parliament hard to distinguish."
"Originally, membership and the electorate was restricted, and the members were largely conservatives. Membership of the house was then restricted to certain sectors of society: only males with a certain net worth could hold a seat. In 1915, these restrictions were removed, and a few new members were appointed by the existing members."
"Warfare in early modern Scotland includes all forms of military activity in Scotland or by Scottish forces, between the adoption of new ideas of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century and the military defeat of the Jacobite movement in the mid-eighteenth century. In the late Middle Ages, Scottish armies were assembled on the basis of common service, feudal obligations and money contracts of ""bonds"" of ""manrent"". In 1513 these systems produced a large and formidable force, but in the mid-sixteenth century there were difficulties in recruitment. Individuals were expected to provide their own equipment, including axes and pole arms. Highland troops often brought bows and two-handed swords. Heavy armour was abandoned after the Flodden campaign. Highland lords tended to continue to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the plaid. The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. The pike replaced the spear and the Scots began to convert from the bow to gunpowder firearms. Feudal heavy cavalry were replaced with light horse, often drawn from the Borders. James IV established a gun foundry in 1511 and gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture. In the 1540s and 1550s, Scotland was given a defended border of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles."
"There were attempts to create royal naval forces in the fifteenth century. James IV founded a harbour at Newhaven and a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. He acquired a total of 38 ships including the ""Great Michael"", at that time the largest in Europe. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king on his expeditions to the islands, and intervened in Scandinavia and the Baltic, but were sold after the Flodden campaign. Scottish naval efforts subsequently relied on privateering captains and hired merchantmen. Despite truces with England there were periodic outbreaks of a ""guerre de course"". James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542. The chief use of naval power in his reign were a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. The Union of Crowns in 1603 ended conflict with England, but England's foreign policy opened up Scottish shipping to attack. In 1626 a squadron of three ships were bought and equipped for protection and there were marque fleets of privateers. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy and privateers participated in the major expedition to Biscay. The Scots also returned to West Indies and in 1629 took part in the capture of Quebec."
"In the early seventeenth century large numbers of Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War. As armed conflict between the Covenanter regime in Scotland and Charles I in the Bishops' Wars became likely, many mercenaries returned home, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie and these veterans played an important role in training recruits. Covenanter armies intervened in the Civil Wars in England and Ireland. Scottish infantry were generally armed with a combination of pike and shot, but individuals may have had weapons including bows and polearms. Most cavalry were probably equipped with pistols and swords, but may have included lancers. Royalist armies, like those led by James Graham, Marquis of Montrose (1643–44) and in Glencairn's rising (1653–54), were mainly composed of conventionally armed infantry with pike and shot. Montrose's forces were short of heavy artillery suitable for siege warfare and had only a small force of cavalry. During the Bishops' Wars, Scottish privateers took English prizes. After the Covenanters allied with the English Parliament they established two patrol squadrons for the Atlantic and North Sea coasts, known collectively as the ""Scotch Guard"". The Scottish navy was unable to withstand the English fleet that accompanied the army led by Cromwell that conquered Scotland in 1649–51 and Scottish ships and crews were split up among the Commonwealth fleet. During the English occupation, more fortresses in the style of the trace italienne were built."
"At the Restoration, infantry regiments and a few troops of horse were established and there were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerrilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Pikemen became less important and after the introduction of the socket bayonet disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,250 men. The Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars. Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs. There were now Royal Navy patrols in Scottish waters even in peacetime. Scottish privateers played a major part in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In the 1690s a fleet of five ships was established for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy of three warships to protect local shipping. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels were transferred to the Royal Navy. At the Union, the standing army was seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery. As part of the British Army, Scottish regiments took part in a series of wars on the European continent. The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed, but arms became more conventional as the rebellions progressed."
"In the later Middle Ages, Scottish armies were still largely assembled on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, with the addition of troops maintained by money contracts of ""bonds"" or ""bands of manrent"". Common service theoretically called all men between the ages of 16 and 60 for a maximum of 40 days in one year. Such troops were expected to serve at their own expense and to bring their own supplies, a factor that severely limited the ability of Scottish armies to take part in sustained campaigning. Feudalism had been introduced to Scotland in the twelfth century, meaning that knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis, particularly heavily armed noble cavalry. Bonds of manrent were similar to English indentures of the same period, used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. Scotland relied on these systems longer than was the case in England. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and major Scottish lords continued to bring contingents from their kindred. In 1513 for the Flodden campaign these systems were successful in producing a large and formidable force, but in the religious and politically divided mid-sixteenth century there is evidence that the authorities were experiencing increasing difficulty in recruitment."
"A series of musters or wapenshaws, between two and four times a year, checked that potential soldiers maintained suitable equipment. Individuals were expected to equip themselves for war according to their estates. Instructions given to sheriffs in 1513 indicated that gentlemen were expected to muster in plate armour, while common soldiers were to come in jacks and sallets. After the disaster at Flodden there seems to have been a deliberate abandonment of plate armour by the nobility, perhaps because of the difficulties it created in handling a pike, and by 1547 many noblemen were virtually indistinguishable from the majority of troops. Highland lords continued to use lighter chainmail and ordinary highlanders dressed in the plaid, leaving their lower legs naked. In place of a jack, they often had a patchwork linen garment, covered with wax or pitch."
"Weapons included various forms of axes and pole arms, including spears, the Lochaber axe, Leith axe and Jedburgh stave. Highland troops often brought bows, two-handed swords (claidheamh mór) and axes. The crown took an increasing role in the supply of equipment. There were attempts to replace polearms with longer pikes of to in the later fifteenth century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, but this does not appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early sixteenth century. By the mid-sixteenth century the pike had emerged as the most important infantry weapon in Scottish armies. Modelling themselves on Swiss and German infantry, Scottish tactics tended to focus on rapidly engaging the enemy, particularly necessary to counter the advantage enjoyed by the English in missile power."
"Like most European nations the Scots in this period began to convert from the bow to gunpowder firearms. Handguns were present in Scottish armies in small numbers from the fifteenth century and there are increasingly frequent references to handguns and arquebus in records. An account of the Scottish vanguard at Haddon Rig in 1542 suggests that half the troops were missile men and half of those were arquebusiers. Equal proportions of missile to melee troops seems to have been an aim of Scottish commanders for most of the century, although it was not always possible in the field. The main source of firearms were the French, who seem to have extensively rearmed the Scottish after the English invasions of the Rough Wooing."
"The English enjoyed a marked superiority over the Scots in cavalry, particularly with the resurgence of heavy cavalry with their use of demi-lancers. The feudal heavy cavalry had begun to disappear from Scottish armies after Bannockburn in 1314. It was limited by the shortage of suitable horses. James V imported great horses and mares from Denmark in an attempt to improve the quality of Scottish breading stock. In the mid-sixteenth century the Scots still lacked sufficient heavy cavalry. In their place they fielded relatively large numbers of light horse, often drawn from the Borders and usually wearing jacks of leather or mail, mounted on small horses and using light lances. As firearms became available they began to field relatively large numbers of mounted arquebusiers."
"James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a gun foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, his 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing Scots army, proving ineffective against the longer-range and smaller-calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden Field."
"Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture from the mid-fifteenth century, with existing castles being adapted to allow the use of gunpowder weapons by the incorporation of ""keyhole"" gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls being modified to resist bombardment. Ravenscraig, Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort, incorporating ""D-shape"" bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted. In the period of French intervention in the 1540s and 1550s, at the end of the Rough Wooing, Scotland was given a defended border of a series of earthwork forts and additions to existing castles. These included the erection of single bastions at Edinburgh, Stirling and Dunbar; the creation of the Scots' Dike on the western end of the border; trace italienne fortresses at Leith, Inchkeith and Langholm; work was also begun at Jedburgh and plans made for works at Kelso. The most aggressive move was a fortified artillery park at Eyemouth, only from the English border stronghold of Berwick."
"There were various attempts to create royal naval forces in the fifteenth century. James IV put the enterprise on a new footing, founding a harbour at Newhaven in May 1504, and two years later ordering the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on Inchgarvie. The king acquired a total of 38 ships for the Royal Scottish Navy, including the ""Margaret"", and the carrack ""Michael"" or ""Great Michael"". The latter, built at great expense at Newhaven and launched in 1511, was in length, weighed 1,000 tons, had 24 cannon, and was, at that time, the largest ship in Europe. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king in his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts in Scandinavia and the Baltic. In the Flodden campaign the fleet consisted of 16 large and 10 smaller craft. After a raid on Carrickfergus in Ireland, it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war. After the disaster at Flodden the Great Michael, and perhaps other ships, were sold to the French. The king's ships disappeared from royal records after 1516 and Scottish naval efforts would rely on privateering captains and hired merchantmen during the minority of James V. In the Italian War of 1521–26, in which England and Scotland became involved on opposing sides, the Scots had six men-of-war active attacking English and Imperial shipping and they blockaded the Humber in 1523. Although prizes were taken by Robert Barton and other captains, the naval campaign was sporadic and indecisive."
"James V entered his majority in 1524. He did not share his father's interest in building a navy, relying on French gifts such as the ""Salamander"", or captured ships like the English ""Mary Willoughby"". Scotland's shipbuilding remained largely at the level of boat building and ship repairs and fell behind the Low Countries which led the way into semi-industrialised ship building. Despite truces between England and Scotland there were periodic outbreaks of commerce raiding in the 1530s with at least four of a known six men-at-war were royal naval vessels on the Scottish side. James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542, called 'Our Lady Port' or 'New Haven,' described in 1544 as having three blockhouses with guns and a pier for great ships to lie in a dock. The chief use of naval power in his reign were a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. In 1536 the king circumnavigated the Isles, embarking at Pittenween in Fife and landing Whithorn in Galloway. Later in the year he sailed from Kirkcaldy with six ships including the 600 ton ""Mary Willoughby"", and arrived at Dieppe to begin his courtship of his first wife Madeleine of Valois. After his marriage he sailed from Le Havre in the ""Mary Willoughby"" to Leith with four great Scottish ships and ten French. After the death of Queen Madeleine, John Barton, in the ""Salamander"" returned to France in 1538 to pick up the new prospective queen, Mary of Guise, with the ""Moriset"" and ""Mary Willoughby"". In 1538 James V embarked on the newly equipped ""Salamander"" at Leith and accompanied by the ""Mary Willoughby"", the ""Great Unicorn"", the ""Little Unicorn"", the ""Lion"" and twelve other ships sailed to Kirkwall on Orkney. Then he went to Lewis on the West, perhaps using the newly compiled charts from his first voyage known as Alexander Lindsay's Rutter."
"Scottish privateers and pirates preyed on shipping in the North Sea and off the Atlantic coast of France. Scotland's Admiralty court judged whether a captured ship was a lawful prize and dealt with the recovery of goods. As the court was entitled to a tenth of the value of a prize, it was a profitable business for the admiral. The privateers Andrew and Robert Barton were still using their letters of reprisal of 1506 against the Portuguese in 1561. The Bartons operated down the east coast of Britain from Leven and the Firth of Forth, while others used the French Channel ports such as Rouen and Dieppe or the Atlantic port of Brest as bases. During the Rough Wooing in 1542, the ""Mary Willoughby"", the ""Lion"", and the ""Salamander"" under the command of John Barton, son of Robert Barton, attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby. They later blockaded a London merchant ship called the ""Antony of Bruges"" in a creek on the coast of Brittany. In 1544 Edinburgh was attacked by an English marine force and burnt. The ""Salamander"" and the Scottish-built ""Unicorn"" were captured at Leith. The Scots still had two royal naval vessels and numerous smaller private vessels, but would have to rely on privateers until the re-establishment of a royal fleet in the 1620s. When, as a result of the series of international treaties, the emperor Charles V declared war upon Scotland in 1544, the Scots were able to engage in a highly profitable campaign of privateering that lasted six years and the gains of which probably outweighed the losses in trade with the Low Countries. They also operated in the West Indies from the 1540s, joining the French in the capture of Burburuta in 1567. English and Scottish naval warfare and privateering broke out sporadically in the 1550s. In 1559, English captain William Winter was sent north with 34 ships and dispersed and captured the Scottish and French fleets, leading to the eventual evacuation of the French from Scotland, and a successful coup of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Scottish and English interests were re-aligned and the naval conflict subsided."
"After the Union of Crowns in 1603 conflict between Scotland and England ended, but Scotland found itself involved in England's foreign policy, opening up Scottish shipping to attack. In the 1620s, Scotland found herself fighting a naval war as England's ally, first against Spain and then also against France, while simultaneously embroiled in undeclared North Sea commitments in the Danish intervention in the Thirty Years' War. In 1626 a squadron of three ships were bought and equipped at a cost of least £5,200 sterling, to guard against privateers operating out of Spanish-controlled Dunkirk and other ships were armed in preparation for potential action. The acting High Admiral John Gordon of Lochinvar organised at least three marque fleets of privateers. It was probably one of Lochinvar's marque fleets that was sent to support the English Royal Navy defending Irish waters in 1626. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy, and accompanying contingents of burgh privateers, participated in the major expedition to Biscay. The Scots also returned to the West Indies, with Lochinvar taking French prizes and founding the colony of Charles Island. In 1629 two squadrons of privateers led by Lochinvar and William Lord Alexander, sailed for Canada, taking part in the campaign that resulted in the capture of Quebec from the French, which was handed back after the subsequent peace."
"In the early seventeenth century relatively large numbers of Scots took service in foreign armies involved in the Thirty Years' War, with 20–30,000 in Swedish service, a Scots brigade in the Netherlands, and 5–6,000 raised for Danish service in the period 1626–27, 11,000 for France and large numbers in the armies of eastern Europe, including German states, Poland and Russia. As armed confrontation between Scotland and the Charles I looked increasingly likely from 1637, the Standing Committee of the Tables began to function as a war council. It appointed two lairds in every parish to draw up lists of men suitable for military service, arms and the names of Scots serving abroad so that they could be recalled. Three commissioners were appointed in each shire, two residing in Edinburgh and another remaining in the locality, where presbyteries appointed commissioners to communicate instructions to the parishes. Hundreds of Scots mercenaries returned home from foreign service, including experienced leaders like Alexander and David Leslie. These veterans played an important role in training the parish recruits. Nobles were able to raise regiments, which usually bore their name as colonel, and they could appoint company commanders, but the lieutenant colonel and sergeant major of the regiment, and the lieutenant and sergeant of each company, were to be professional soldiers. The returning soldiers also brought expertise in fortification and trace italliene fortifications were added at Leith, Burntisland and Greenock. They would play a major role in the siege of Edinburgh in 1650."
"The appointment of Leslie as field marshal avoided a contest between inexperienced nobles for leadership and his reputation made the service by Scottish mercenaries in Covenanter armies more likely. He became an ex offico member of the Tables, enabling him to influence policy and take part in issuing dispatches. Although producing a relatively large and efficiently organised army, it was hastily assembled, and short of money and supplies. The Covenanting regime had to make assessments on parishes and relied on loans from Edinburgh merchants, making a long campaign difficult to sustain. In the view of historian James Scott Wheeler, the first Covenanter army was ""marginally trained, irregularly armed, poorly paid and badly supplied"", but it proved sufficient to the task."
"Between the two Bishops' Wars the Covenanters maintained one regiment of infantry and many of their officers who had drilled the local militias on half pay. The militas were now armed with firearms purchased in the Netherlands. The Tables were replaced with a committee of estates, with wide-ranging powers, and kept to same system of commissioners. One in four able bodied men were able to muster when mobilisation began for renewed confrontation in 1640. The army was paid for by more loans and a new national tax known as the ""tenth"" or ""tenth penny"". These systems would form the basis of the Covenanter armies that operated in Ireland, intervened in the First Civil War (1642–46) in England on the side of Parliament and subsequently, and less successfully, on the side of the king in the Second (1648–49) and Third Civil Wars (1649–51)."
"Scottish infantry were generally armed, as was almost universal in Western Europe, with a combination of pike and shot. Pikes were theoretically long, but were often shortened by a foot or two to make them more manageable, this had disastrous consensuses at the Battle of Benburb (1646), where the Confederate Irish defeated the Scots because they possessed longer pikes. Musketeers were mainly armed with matchlock muskets, with some firelocks (probably mainly reserved for troops defending the baggage and ammunition) and there were a handful of troops that brought more accurate rifled guns. Continental experience tended to increasingly emphasise firepower over melee and this was reflected in the greater proportions of shot to pike, usually in proportions of three to two. Scottish armies may also have had individuals with weapons including bows, Lochaber axes, and halberds. as recruits who lacked pike and shot were told to report with these. Most cavalry were probably equipped with pistols and swords, although there is some evidence that they included lancers."
"Royalist armies, like those led by James Graham, Marquis of Montrose (1643–44) and in Glencairn's rising (1653–54) were mainly composed of conventionally armed infantry with pike and shot. Montrose's army also included a contingent of Irish Confederate troops and Scottish recruits from Highland clans hostile to the Clan Campbell, under the under leadership of Alasdair Mac Colla. Glencairn's rising gained some support from Lowland Scottish lords and at its height had 3,500 infantry and 1,500 cavalry. The forces under Montrose's command reached about the same numbers of infantry, but were short of heavy artillery suitable for siege warfare and had only a small force of cavalry, about 300, supplied from the estate of the Earls of Huntly."
"During the Bishops' Wars the king attempted to blockade Scotland, disrupting trade and the transport of returning troops from the continent. The king planned amphibious assaults from England on the east coast and from Ireland to the west, but they failed to materialise. Scottish privateers took English prizes and the Covenanters planned to fit out Dutch ships with Scottish and Dutch crews to join the naval war effort. After the Covenanters allied with the English Parliament they established two patrol squadrons for the Atlantic and North Sea coasts, known collectively as the ""Scotch Guard"". These patrols guarded against Royalist attempts to move men, money and munitions and raids on Scottish shipping, particularly from ships based in Wexford and Dunkirk. They consisted mainly of small English warships, controlled by the Commissioners of the Navy based in London, but it always relied heavily on Scottish officers and revenues, and after 1646, the West Coast squadron became much more a Scottish force. The Scottish navy was unable to withstand the English fleet that accompanied the army led by Cromwell that conquered Scotland in 1649–51. The Scottish ships and crews were divided among the Commonwealth fleet."
"During the English occupation of Scotland under the Commonwealth, fortresses in the style of the trace italienne were built. These were polygonal in plan with triangular bastions, as at Ayr, Inverness and Leith. Twenty smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost in money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped from as far away as Aberdeen, had cost £50,0000 when it was still unfinished by 1655. Inverlochy had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires."
"At the Restoration the Privy Council established a force of an unknown number of infantry regiments and a few troops of horse. The Commonwealth fortresses were abandoned, but garrisons were placed in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dumbarton and Blackness castles. There were attempts to found a national militia on the English model. The standing army was mainly employed in the suppression of Covenanter rebellions and the guerilla war undertaken by the Cameronians in the East. Units included a regiment of foot guards, later known as the Scots Guards and Le Regiment of Douglas, formed and serving in France since 1633, it returned, eventually became the Royal Regiment of Foot. Pikemen became less important in the late seventeenth century and after the introduction of the socket bayonet, a process complete by 1702, disappeared altogether, while matchlock muskets were replaced by the more reliable flintlock. Three troops of Scots Dragoons were raised in 1678 and another three were added to make The Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons in 1681. On the eve of the Glorious Revolution the standing army in Scotland was about 3,000 men in various regiments and another 268 veterans in the major garrison towns, at an annual cost of about £80,000. After the Glorious Revolution the Scots were drawn into King William II's continental wars, beginning with the Nine Years' War in Flanders (1689–97)."
"Although Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment onto English men-of-war under Charles II, a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs during the second half of the seventeenth century. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS ""Kingfisher"", which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685. Scotland went to war against the Dutch and their allies in the Second (1665–67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672–74) as an independent kingdom. Scottish captains, at least 80 and perhaps 120, took letters of marque, and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars."
"By 1697 the English Royal Navy had 323 warships, while Scotland was still dependent on merchantman and privateers. In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces were put in motion. As usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the Darien Scheme to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America. It was undertaken by the Company of Scotland, who created a fleet of five ships, including the ""Caledonia"" and the ""St. Andrew"", built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg. It sailed to Isthmus of Darien in 1698, but the venture failed and only one ship returned to Scotland. In the same period it was decided to establish a professional navy for the protection of commerce in home waters during the Nine Years' War, with three purpose-built warships bought from English shipbuilders in 1696. These were the ""Royal William"", a 32-gun fifth rate, and two smaller ships, the ""Royal Mary"" and the ""Dumbarton Castle"", each of 24 guns and generally described as frigates. After the Act of Union in 1707, the Scottish Navy merged with that of England and the three vessels of the small Royal Scottish Navy were transferred to the Royal Navy."
"By the time of the act of Union, the Kingdom of Scotland had a standing army of seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery in the garrison castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton, and Stirling. Their role was of such importance that the Scots Parliament forced Queen Anne to give royal assent to the controversial 1704 Act of Security by threatening to withdraw Scottish forces back out of the Confederate armies. The new British Army created by the Act of Union in 1707 incorporated existing Scottish regiments, such as the Scots Guards, The Royal Scots 1st of Foot, King's Own Scottish Borderers 25th of Foot, The Cameronians 26th of Foot, Scots Greys and the Royal Scots Fusiliers 21st of Foot. The new armed forces were controlled by the War Office and Admiralty from London. During this period, Scottish soldiers and sailors were instrumental in supporting the expansion of the British Empire and became involved in international conflicts, including the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–13), the Quadruple Alliance (1718–20), wars with Spain (1727–29) and (1738–48) and the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48). The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch, the 43rd (later 42nd) regiment, in 1740. It marked the beginning of a major role for Highlanders within the British military structure, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion and would not begin in earnest until the late 1750s."
"The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. They were 70 per cent of the forces in the 1715 rebellion and over 90 per cent of those in 1745. Most were forced to join by their clan chiefs, landlords or feudal superiors and desertion was a major problem during campaigns. The Jacobites suffered from a lack of trained officers. A typical clan regiment was made up of a small minority of gentlemen (tacksmen) who would bear the clan name. The clan gentlemen formed the front ranks of the unit and were more heavily armed than their impoverished tenants who made up the bulk of the regiment. Because they served in the front ranks, the gentlemen suffered higher proportional casualties than the common clansman. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed. In the rising of 1745, at the Battle of Prestonpans, some only had swords, Lochaber axes, pitchforks and scythes, but arms tended to become more conventional as the campaigns progressed. Only officers and gentlemen were equipped with a broadsword, targe and pistol. After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the Hanoverian commander the Duke of Cumberland reported that there were 2,320 firelocks recovered from the battlefield, but only 190 broadswords."
