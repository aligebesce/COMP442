Yeah.
Measure  the works
re
"In, in, in, in the past"
words.
the resident engineer has been doing the measure and also agreeing the valuations.
Well I don't think
Now
what Hughie's saying is that that will be done
Th that responsibility
mutually
valuations because we've got this
Mm.
Perhaps you do.
"which, which"
Personally I don't think really there's a need for a great deal of site measurement.
"I think, I think it should all be, you know, basically it should be done from"
The offices.
because they've dug a big hole doesn't mean you measure the big hole.
It's all part of the measuring anyway.
You're paying for the hole they should have dug provided it was at least as big as they
In accordance with the  and the er the
what do you call it?
Yeah well.
The
Preamble.
preamble.
"Can I take it then, that these items will be clearly defined when the project coordinator discusses with the team quantity surveyor at the"
Who does what.
Yes.
Who does what because
Yes.
I'll just ri rinse my fingers  hand cream on my hands.
"That  was used as er, I can't remember what Richard was using it as yesterday"
He was poking it
What're we going to do about these tiles for the step?
To cover this little hole up.
I hate to think what must be down there now.
"Oh, where're my other glasses?"
and they were cheaper than
Cheaper?
Fenwicks?
"Cheaper than what you call it, the place in  I've got the price"
Cheaper than the do it yourself shop up ?
But when can we get through to Newcastle?
"Well I, well I'm on a weeks' holiday aren't I, at Easter?"
"And I've got to go, unless we go to  Tuesday  been to the dentist"
Which Tuesday?
After they break up?
That's right.
Which is  next Friday
Yes
So I hope they've sorted out
The what?lin
The  appeal at the school that Mrs  was supposed to have let Miss White know so she could send it off to the parents to get the money back  scanner
You didn't tell me about that
I did tell you
You didn't.
"All you told me, hang on, ah"
Miss White
"all you told me was that Miss White was retiring but I hadn't to tell anyone, which I haven't done, which I don't intend to do"
"At the beginning of Lent, Miss White approached me to see what she should do about the  appeal"
Ah ha
"as she always does, since I said why send money to Great Ormond Street when there was plenty of children  locally?"
"Erm nineteen er probably just about erm nineteen nineteen, nineteen twenty time that one."
"There's another similar loco, Railway, one seventy eight, spinner."
Nottingham behind.
Underneath the old  bridge over the top.
"Again a train to er out to Lincoln, one of the two four Os."
Very much in use on the Lincoln line until certainly during the wars.
Till till about the beginning of the second world war.
Along with and the other guns of four four O.
"Mainstay of the motive power at the n, and on the Nottingham Suburban Services, erm the old er  built erm er round top fire box, with the  safety valves er and erm er  well no condensing here or anything on it."

"Again all in Nottingham Station, on local."
"And there we are ladies and gentlemen, as er all things should finish with the Queen."
Erm
That er concludes my little contribution to the evening's entertainment.
Erm I hope it may be of some interest.
Erm it is I assure you but a fraction of what I've got.
but erm they difficulty is in erm let's say keeping within a couple of hours.
Well that's fantastic..
Erm anyhow thank you er all very much.
Right.
Is there anybody
how you got started singing?
How I got started singing?
Aye.
"Well me, oh, how I got started singing, it was really just  I didn't sing very much really."
My dad was a good singer.
"He wasn't a trained singer or anything, it was, just happened that he, he was a good singer."
My younger brother he's a good singer as well.
But er us
"Did he sing at home, your dad?"
"He just sang round about the house, aha."
"Right, so  me and Jim had a chat the other day  just looking at the  the roadside entries and the counts and I was sort of saying  if we work on the basis that we want between ten and twelve people, twelve people maximum"
Mm.
erm I think we're be able to do all the counts with that number of people including the  St David's roundabout and
Mm.
but we do need to clarify exactly what you want on that.
"Whether you want  samples doing cos that's gonna take more people, or whether you're just doing ins and outs  and stuff like that."
Well
And on the other roundabout for that matter.
Are you off?
Yeah I've got a  seminar in Manchester .
Oh right.
How did it go?
Fine.
Probably find that  traffic  percent
"we're just talking now this, this is, this is one we're discussing."
Oh well just south of Caernarvon on the first section erm between Caernarvon and ?
Yes.
Yeah.
Gwyneth haven't really started on doing any of that work yet.
work.
And they need to do traffic.
"And also they need to confirm the traffic erm turning  099 junction at er  I can never pronounce it, beginning with an L."
Yeah .
"And er maybe count, maybe  do their traffic counts out of that as well."
So the guy that was in charge of those schemes with Gwyneth
Yeah.
was at the meeting or came into the meeting to explain about the schemes.
What's his name?
Erm
Peter will know.
Peter's got his name down.
Cos that was one of the things we talked about
The secretary would approach the Hulton secretary.
The treasurer asked if we could make an early start to the meetings  eight P M prompt.
It looked very bad when we advertised an eight P M start  and if
if you members came along  there was only two or three people here at eight P M.
"This concluded the business of the A G M  and the chairman closed the, the meeting at ten ten  ten past ten."
Other club business  social evening on Monday the twenty first of December  Mr  would donate egg and cress sandwiches  B W  would donate cheese  cheese and onion  Wilf  would donate boiled ham.

Prizes required please.
There was no further business  the chairman closed the meeting at ten forty P M.
Any matters arising from those minutes?
No matters arising?
"Can we have a proposer and seconder, please?"
Yes is there a proposer?
And a seconder?
Seconded.
I haven't got a   you don't give me one!
I'll give you er  give you an extra cup of tea at supper time.
Thank you.
"Oh  hang on a minute, the secretary can go first."
Oh matters arising.

No  correct.
No matters arising.
No.

Yeah but Joe  Joe proposed
Yeah we've done that bit  we've done that bit
and Brian  seconded

now we're on to matters arising.
"Yeah  minutes of the previous A G M proposed and seconded, right?"
"Erm, no I haven't, Claire has, nick some of hers."
Yeah.
"I've got some Marmite, and I'm just"
Do you want some jam?
"Claire's got some Vitalite, I think."
Anything will do.
"Mike organized it, for me to go over there and then  I didn't need to be there at all, cos noth nobody turned up."
Ah.
So I've er
I'm sure they're really grateful for you
I don't think Maryanne even knows I've been there.
You don't think what?
Maryanne knows I've been.
No.
"Do you arrange it all, then?"
"I think, yeah, well he rang me, so erm, I think she was expecting, I think they, when they left the house this morning, he was thinking, he'd be able to get home in time for it, and erm, then he got to work and the day wasn't, hadn't worked out the way he expected."
"And like, did you hear about that unexploded bomb, in the Second World War, the two thousand pound bomb on the"
News last night.
No.
"Do you want tea or coffee,?"
"I'll have a coffee, please."
"There was two thousand pound, Second World War bomb, they found in Walton, which is right near the River Thames which is, like, past Hampton Court, and Mike said that he'd have to go out there today, and it's er erm, this guy who he works for, owns a Leisure Centre right beside where this bomb is."
So he'll need to go down there with his associates and had to evacuate the Leisure Centre.
"Oh, really?"
They just found this bomb and they were going to have a controlled explosion at the car park
Oh.
"So, that made the day a bit more interesting, but he's been stuck with er, all these upper class councillors that telling him what his job is, and"
Don't go down very well.
"He said, he's not impressed, and er, I think the idea that go   at a meeting today,"
"Yeah, turn that power off before you do any more to that  it's silly isn't it ?"
Erm.
Yeah.
Betty.
Mm.
Unfortunately there seems to be a resurgence of  of this now doesn't there  in Europe?
Yes.
This right wing element which is
Terrible!
"It's frightening really because you think well  you know, I mean  you said the years well that couldn't happen"
Well
again but  but how long does it take before it does happen again?
"I mean, do the other  do these things happen in cycles and tha you know, is it possible that it'll happen again on a greater scale?"
A grand
Well
"scale, if you like?"
"it er  I mean, it's  having grounds now because of the recession!"
Yes.
"That is, that"
Yes.
is what brought it about er in
Setting the stage for
"in one way, in in"
"Although it hasn't  it hasn't come to that in Germany, I mean we'll probably be the poor man of Europe at the moment aren't we?"
In this country?
"Ah but, I mean it's biting in Germany now because they've got all East Germans!"
"That's  yes, yes, that's true."
Biting before that weren't it?
Where
Erm
"they've had to close down the spi ,and that."
"and of course, when, when they  when"
This of course is exacerbated.
but  the going gets tough it's  it's easy to blame minority groups and this is what happened before wasn't it?
"Like on the ruddy  that's all they're doing now, bringing all these Turks and God knows what!"
Yeah.
D'ya know what I mean?
"And, and obviously it was ridiculous, every second word I was having to look up and then I'd get all that and it moves onto the next one."
Yep.
Which is ridiculous.
Anybody had
this experience?
"Erm  okay, the first word was erm  it talked about alchemy."
Any other problems with the language?
"Either  other areas where it's very specialized and you had to look up words, or other difficulties with the"
Yeah.
language?
It's not everyday English.
It's not everyday English.
"What at the moment, at th right, so a lot of, erm"
Yeah.
Ah but that is a good distinction.
Stereo.
Erm  ahead  in the sense that
Yeah.
we're used to a lot of Shakespeare's archaisms because he was studying them at A level and Shakespeare's got so a special sort of band of them that he uses.
"Even so, I  they can go and look up that lot of words in Shakespeare."
But Johnson  they're often old words  that are totally out of use  erm  and  we're not even used to Johnson's vocabulary because
it's not taught in schools.
At least not part  the mainstream part of our culture.
Any other reasons for the language difficulty?
"Or that the speech is difficult or the, any, any reason that there's a, a page that's difficult to read?"
"Er, it strikes me with the, with the comedy, he's trying to be so funny that he shoots off at all these angles and not having"
Aha.
"left, sort of boundaries."
Okay.
"So  erm  well, you might like to say that"
Another one at Holgate Road fifteen erm York Road Acomb twenty.
Walmgate twelve pounds and Hull Road twelve pounds.
Er Fulford Road eighteen pounds.
Presto Main Street Haxby eighteen pounds.
Another couple at Acomb for twenty pounds and then they also give just a cost for Ripon and Scarborough.
So I don't know about anybody else but that's cheaper than I expected it to be.
Yes absolutely.
And the fact that they're several in Fulford that I'd say are very good sites.
I always read them erm when I  about Fulford .
At Fulford Road or Fishergate would be the best one to go for.
Yes.
Are these the sort of the like to the end of bus stops?
Well from what I can gather the cheaper one on Fishergate is a bus stop size one.
There's one actually at the bus stop by the Police Station and there's another one on the corner of the erm just before you turn into  Terrace there's there's a free standing one outside the shop there.
And I think the eighteen pound one is probably the big one on the side of Jacksons building.
Erm actually high up you know full size billboard.
Which I'd say is less useful in fact than the little ones.
I think the little ones might  noticed.
Cos I mean I all whenever I'm going travelling into into York and they've changed that billboard I always look at it.
Yeah.
People in cars will notice the big one a lot better .
Yeah that's true.
Which is our target audience
Obviously yes.
wait at bus stops.
Right could be a policy decision this couldn't it?
Anyway I suppose before we decide we really need to know how much the National Party are going to charge us if anything for the actual posters and what the posters look like.
Yeah.
And how many posters they what size and shape of posters they're doing which will affect which site of course.
That's right.
no good.
So I'll give
"Yeah , erm, it's worth waiting to"
I saw Mr Bentley
Mm.
and er he hasn't got any stuff there of course
No.
"but er, he said oh try the guy"
Try?
"the chap in Mold, whatever his name is"
Robert .
"I he said, he's an old type chemist he said just mention my name he said he perhaps fix you up with small quantities or try this other place in Wrexham he said they, chemist he said but they do wholesale work as well"
Mm.
"so, and then he was going on about the work he's doing on the"
Yes I thought he probably would.
You were nearly at the end of the tape as well weren't you?
I thought afterwards I bet that tape would run out when you're talking to and won't be able to turn it over.
"Mm, I don't think so  but er he's had an awful struggle with that because he said Buckley's one of the worse places and no interest at all"
"Nobody's interested no, it's a shame"
"said er , they said Wrexham they've got two or three you know mu museums for, and that different halls he said er"
"Well, there was talk about er getting the old hall down in the old street community centre, not the, the"
Yes
What is it?
What do they call it that hall?
Hawkesbury hall
"Hawkesbury hall, yes"
"by the school, yeah"
"but I mean it's, it's still a sound building, I mean it could be"
"Well it's been no, no, it's, it's condemned at the moment it's not safe."
Is it?
"Oh yeah, you're not allowed to go in it"
Oh oh they've just locked
but er
locked it up because er
"And could you tell me when and where you were born, please?"
"Yes, I was born in  Lane at  Lane on the eleventh November, nineteen seventeen."
And erm could you describe the house you were born in at all?
"Yes, it was a tt a very large semi-detached house  with erm a smallholding attached."
My father was a miner but loved his garden and we had a big smallholding
Mhm.
"all garden, and at the bottom was a streamlet, then had trout in it.."
"So did you live with your parents, in your both your parent in your early life?"
"Yes, erm, that was where I was born and er then when I was five my father erm hit a bad patch and he sold the house and er he decided to become a shoemaker in Baysford."
And he and my mother had a disagreement about this and er the result was that my father became very ill and I went home to Grandma.
And you you lived with your grandparents then?
"Yes, and then my father, when he had recovered a bit, he came to live with Grandma."
Mm.
"And we I had a brother, a younger brother, as well."
Mm.
Were there?
Did you ever get any feeling of sort of distaste from anybody about about y your mother leaving home?
No.
No.
"My father was  shall we say, well respected and er no, there was no There was never any query about it."
Mm.
"So, you lived with your grandparents then."
Was your grandfather a miner as well?
"Yes, my granda this was my second grandfather because my gra my own grandfather had died, before I was born, and my grandmother had married again and he was a he was the arm-setter at  Colliery."
Mm.
"And your father was a miner at this time, as well?"
Yes.
"And also in the house was Uncle my grandfather  's brother, Uncle Bill, who was er a winder at  Colliery."
Mm.
"So everybody was based at  at , then?"
Yes.
"Do you have many memories of well, the men in the house, coming home from the pit, and talking about the conditions?"
They had a working committee didn't they and a sub
It's East Herts isn't it?
I think.
Was it East Herts?
"East Herts, yeah."
Yeah East Herts.
Environmental sub committee?
Yeah.
He sits on it.
"Well he had this environment mental officer, they they in inaugurated him  then at this meeting  meeting when  erm  the thing you handed over"
Charter.
The environment charter.
Why's it a sub committee?
What happened to the  proper committee as well.
Yeah.
reports then back to the proper actual coun the er
The work's  committee
district council meeting.
"Well I know at district  council there was two environmental groups, was it the officers group and the  members group."
Oh.
I wonder which group
Herts county council.
Cos when I was on the Hertfordshire Environmental  of the group which has folded
"I've got all this money in the Abbey National and there's no, no group any more, I think I'll have to keep"
Keep quiet.
I'll have to send it off to .
But anyway it transpired that there were two groups sort of working towards the same end and nobody could work out what sort of erm role each played and it was terrible.
Because you knew that they both had to agree before anything was done.
Oh.
I suppose that was one way of nothing being done.
"Yes, they didn't communicate."
The officers group and the members group that was right.
"No, there's always been a mandate workshop, explaining why, you know, what our mandate is ."
"You, you did give once to a group a few years ago."
"Yes, I've done the mandate workshop, yes, and I've done it with other groups too."
Mm.
"So you've covered a bigger region in the past, not just Stortford."
"I, I have about five or six groups, I can, I can go and give talks  ."
"So even if we don't  call on you to, do it, you won't be called  ."
And I have a lobby workshop too.
"Amnesty's mandate what, what the  don't do, or do do."
"Will there be any erm talking about lobbying, be in, in erm  before and er ."
I don't know .
Done any .
.
So the er lobbying workshops is the
.
That's why they're being cancelled
"Epping Forest and Redbridge are doing, erm, they've got some lobbying workshops"
"Mm, presuming it's got that in mind"
"Yeah, I mean he is  ."
.
"Lobbying workshops would be that combined, erm  there is er, a one page journalist leaflet which we can order a pound for a hundred, that's it, that's all our journalist  friends ."
", yes that's , erm  yeah, I, last month I received the er, this booklet on the  trade and they seemed to be coming out to doing campaign on erm a collection between British training and goods, er and their use abroad erm, and they now, they've got a, a booking form for a fringe meeting at the A G M, if anyone's particularly interested attending."
"Shall I pass, shall we pass this one ."
.
"Yes, the report on this, this book."
"Yes,there are, there are feature on the, just highlighting a couple of case for these, I imagine a problem book"
Yeah.
"and, there is ."
"It is a good book that I, I've read through that, it's quite an informative."
It was in one of the Sunday .
"It's called the M S P, the Military Security Police, mm."
Security
"Many would say that as George the Sixth, he succeeded where Edward had failed."
George had discipline.
"A sense of duty, a loyal wife and children."
"Affection bringing with it devoted support, brought success from a role undertaken reluctantly."
Edward said he could not fulfil the role without the support of the woman he loved.
Some family black sheep are making a bid for affection.
"Edward had the attention of the whole world, but without adequate personal affection, it was of no avail."
"On December the eighth, nineteen thirty-six, time of the ab abdication, the Times published a singularly apt quotation from  A Hopeless, Throneless King, Loathsome to Men Below To God's Above a Sad Example of the Slights of Life."
What is your view of the way Edward was treated after his  abdication.
"And none of us admits to being alive when all this happened, we, that goes without saying."
Absolutely.
I did see him as a six year old child.
"So  yes, as a"
"Visited our town, our  town."
He was a six year old child.
"Erm, I was a six year"
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yeah."
So wh wh what do you think of the the attitude that was displayed towards him after the abdication?
"He was very, very, generously treated."
Far too generously.
"I mean, he he could  five hundred thousand pound on a Christmas present to his bride."
My God.
Mm.
"He was more or less paid to go away and keep his head down, wasn't he."
Yeah.
No matter what the cost.
Most of the cr
"Now it's all over,attitude, push it all away."
Yeah.
"All the here , a lot of the hereditary jewellery never, never got found."
No.
No.
Er   ha !
Wimborne market every Tuesday  and Wimborne horse sale every other Friday.
"Used to have  horse sale every fortnight, see every other Friday."
Ha!
You wouldn't think that there was a  enough business to want a horse sale once a fortnight would you?
But  mm.
"Course, it was horses in them days, not motorcars."
I can remember  first motorcar that we drove in   old Charlie  's.
"Old Charlie's  car  wooden spokes, wooden wheels  solid tyres  and he used to sit up right in there  same as I am now, like in a box  and the old chauffeur   was the chauffeur driving along."
And I suppose they go along about  I don't expect they do about six miles an hour.
"Just, chug, chug, chug, chug."
At least it was some other form of transport than a horse.
Oh yes!
Gave the horses a bit of a rest.
Mm.
Er er er  er er er
"I would think the mo , motorcar nowadays can go up to something like two hundred odd miles now is it?"
Yeah.
Mm.
And when you see them racing on the television!
Mm.
Oh yeah.
Ah!
But don't matter what it is everything is increasing in speed.
Now you see  in my days on the railway  sixty miles an hour was a good speed for a train it di it didn't reckon to  do much more than that see.
"I know  er, down at Corfe Junction or a  one road across or one another across or  there was one road going to Wimborne, one going to Broadstone, up road and down road."
"And of course, they had these signs up  about la up close to a signal  er  twenty, twenty five or thirty or whatever it was, that was miles an hour, they were supposed to reduce to that."
"And er  I can remember one day a driver, Len  his name was and  he er  he said to the inspector, oh he says er  I've been through Corfe Junction he said at sixty miles an hour!"
What!
"Ooh he said, you don't wanna make a song about it!"
"But he said, I have done."
"And er  course, that where the restrictions was on see  at the  and of course, after that, a few years after that, of course take no notice of it now."
"Oh, buggery bollocks  you take yours anyway,get on"
"Erm, so   like all their ideas, on the erm, you know the ideas they were putting"
Yeah.
"were that in, in the borough there's lots of like fallen land, like, you know, Esher Common and things like that,"
Yeah.
"that they thought they could develop and hav hold events on, and er, he said, like we, we came up with some good ideas, put forward some ideas, really good ideas, for things to do on this land, and he said, the trouble is that all these councillors back on to these pieces of land, and he said, er, they don't want people coming along and enjoying themselves on it, because they want to go and walk their labradors on it."
"Oh, I see."
"So it might disturb their neighbourhood, you know, so they weren't very impressed with his ideas."
Ow.
"So er, he hasn't had a very good day at work, a bit fed up."
"But Alfie's coming down tonight, and they're going out."
Does he come down and visit quite a lot?
Yeah.
Does he?
"He's his partner in crime, as he calls it."
Do you think Maryanne's alright about that?
"Oh yeah, yeah."
All friends together as it were.
"Yeah, no, that's doesn't bother her at all."
"I mean, they've been on their own for weeks, so."
"You know, at the w they like to spend their weekends with everybody."
"Yeah, they don't want to section themselves off, obviously."
"I mean, Mike was like, you gonna stay down    and I was, I haven't seen anybody at college all week, so I think I'd better go back, actually."
"But erm, I did tell Maryanne if she wanted to go shopping tomorrow, I shall be around."
"Oh, God, yeah, I've forgot abo mind you Emily's coming back tomorrow, isn't she?"
Possibly.
But she might not be back till Sunday.
"Oh, I see."
"Do wh what do you, personally what do you think she'll do ?"
What Em?
Sunday I would have thought.
"Really, yeah."
day in day day out
True.
and it wasn't one of ours that dropped their whip
That's true.
out there so you know you can criticize .
Talking of the whip I mean we're only allowed to hit them five times over here.
In America they seem to hit them twenty five times
And in all sorts
everywhere they want to
anywhere they want to
Yeah
So  but there it's it's a very interesting point there because a lot of our young boys now the Dow Holland Alan Munroes are riding more the American style.
It's an interesting point.
I don't think he's right in what he says but I think it might have been a bit tongue in cheek as well.
They certainly weren't saying it about Lester Piggott on Royal Academy a couple of years back either.
No but I did say about it Lester Piggott on  a few weeks ago .
Yes.
Lester Piggott when he won on .
Mm.
And the next    .
Very good.
Very good impression.
Talking of Lester Piggott he of course was the winner of the first ever Channel Four personality of the year trophy which we awarded for the first time last year.
He was a guest on the morning line at Newmarket and there it is that magnificent  trophy which is valued at five thousand pounds.
Now we couldn't have him in this year to give the others a chance so this is how you voted for the nineteen ninety three racing personality of the year on Channel Four and let's take it in reverse order starting with the person who finished fourth.
In fourth place one of the hardest working and most successful trainers in Britain Jack Barry.
He polled nine percent.
In third place the most successful jockey in the history of national hunt racing Peter Scudimore.
He polled eleven percent.
Runner-up the ever popular Willie Carson.
Willie received seventeen percent of the overall votes.
So who did you vote for?
"Mm, but, urgh."
"I got erm, three of those, erm, you know, those diet, sort of, erm, what they called, you know the yoghurts with the two dips bits in it, you know, three of those for ninety nine pence, in Iceland."
"Oh, that's good."
Mm.
"Yoghurts are expensive, aren't they?"
"They are, that's why I got that offer for three big ones."
"Actually, they did have six for fifty nine P in Iceland, but the date was up on them like, Sunday, and I thought, I won't get through all the them."
"Once they start going off  it's not really worth having them, so."
Bought me trusted cottage cheese.
"Some parsnips, some carrots, cucumber, onion, apples."
"Didn't get the  plates, I'm gonna get them tomorrow, it's too awkward to carry   but I generally get nothing exciting."
Just the bare essentials.
I've got masses.
Really.
"Like, I've got half a pepper, and a piece of cheese and some, some kind of sp spread."
spreads.
"Erm, a loaf of bread I'm sharing with Teresa."
"Two packets of Cuppa Soup, but I'm not sure that it wasn't Cuppa Soup, cos I've said to Thomas, I'm not  at the moment."
Really?
"Erm, so cheese on toast, and Cuppa Soup for you, then."
"Probably be nothing, actually."
"I eat, I went, when I went round to Maryanne and my  baked bread next door, I like I went down, I went in there before, before I went upstairs into the flat, and bought a, a roll for twelve P."
"Oh, yeah, that was good."
Mm.
"Soft roll, and then erm, I had a Viennese Whirl with it, and I sat and had that with my can of Diet Coke that dad bought a can of drink on the train this morning and never drank."
"Did you have lunch in a park, did you say?"
"Yeah, we had a piece of quiche,"
That was nice.
"and a hot chocolate,in this park in London."
"It was really nice, we had a good old drive around,"
Mm.
"Hampstead, erm, round Hampstead, round Highgate, had to drive up there, it's so nice."
Jonathan !
you're working for a hundred
Yeah.
and forty pound a week but
Would you go and check see what the heating's on?
you have to be sick  you still get paid
The temperature's
I said you're going about it with the wrong attitude!
Mm.
A lot of people say I'm bloody lucky to get paid for being at home sick!
And that they've got a job.
"Yep, I said what are you"
Oh
I said no I was home sick  and I   in bed like you said I couldn't   who's gonna turn round and say well there are Geoff there's a hundred quid mate
That's it.
we know you're ill in bed?
I said but you're
Nobody is!
bloody lucky!
"I said that'd do you good to be in business for a couple of years, that'd get you sorted out!"
"They all think that's like  he said they think oh stand up in the corridor, that's alright, Amy said  if you don't  if you have a holiday, you don't get no money"
Absolutely!
Well like they're
He said they don't know half!
"that's what I said to Ron, I mean I've never known  I can't remember the last time I when I used to work for Colin for ten years  trying to get a holiday out of Colin was like trying to get blood!"
"Oh you can't have two weeks at once you know  but over there you gotta get rid of your holidays before December, you gotta get rid of them otherwise you lose them."
"Take them, you've got to get rid of them!"
Mm.
"In the end I couldn't get rid of them, I had two days off  when I was ill  and I had as holidays  to ge to get them  sort of settled up you know."
To get what?
That's like this woman at work
To get .
You will
the reason why we're the reason why we're doing this now is is to
Right.
try and achieve that objective.
Mm.
Not t to drop it straight on them but to say.
"look, this is one we're introducing this is the way we in in intend to use it."
Mm.
"I mean there might be the odd situation, the big job, where the Q S would need to go and"
Right.
get involved in the measures on some of your work.
Well he doesn't.
That's what I'm saying.
He hasn't done yet.
"You can't have that, he doesn't."
Have a word with Dave  and ask him himself
Dave Dave was a party to this s
"D Dave, Dave wrote this"
procedure.
did the change.
Well you may be certain he didn't consult with me.
Yeah.
And that's the point I'm making.
Mm.
"These procedures should be manag you know part of management consultation, not part of the  Dave writes it, if he like says, well that's what we'll do for B E S, and then, and then I'm told, oh, that's what we do for B E S, I tell staff, and that causes a great deal of unrest in staff."
Hey Jim why?
Why
back on him?
Jim.
Cos I haven't had an opportunity to do it to
"Why should B E S be a different, a different situation from bridges or works?"
"Well in, in theory certainly probably there is no reason for it, but in practice, it hasn't happened yet this is the point."
"well the phrase at the end, I'm just about get , but,"
Yeah
"get the phrase in the end, it's, what we've done is, at the end they go, they do a"
"rolling, rolling down the river, rolling, rolling, down the river, rolling, rolling down the river"
"and they, no, and they dropped  rolling, rolling  see what I mean?"
Oh yeah
"One, two and when you think, you think"
You want another one?
"Ooh I've got one another, it goes  rolling on the river  right"
yeah
yeah
no
"what I found very different, wrong with this"
"I mean you're like me, you want profession, you don't just come out and throw it, like that, you see"
"Oh we used to do one with erm the band, sometimes I'd get it right, others I wouldn't, but like you've just said they come"
"come up after and say, ah, that bit late for"
"I, but you did it for"
"Yeah, yeah, like I come down the other week and I"
Yeah
"I'm getting it, I'm getting over it very, very, very slowly"
"Here are, give us it back"
"I'm not being rude now, I've just come back from the Gambia and I haven't stopped"
"what you've just said now, and I'm gonna go now"
I don't know what the hell it is
"Oh well, I'll have to be careful, I don't know what er, what's, what happened"
"I said, I said to them, oh I hope he don't think I'm"
"but I said because you bring some guy, you'll lend me the room on a Sunday afternoons, up and down"
"you know, put the whistle on, and then bring them up and that'll be me"
"Yeah, I"
"I like do the Tom and, I won't, Tom and Jerry, I might do the Tom Jones one, cos I, I feel comfortable at"
Which I don't
You don't have to be beautiful
then then reshape the inside.
Yeah.
Er something before I I always forget everything.
The German Friends of the Earth's people told me never to do the washing on Monday mornings.
I mean that's something to put there as well I think.
Because  it's a peak time for electricity and the Electricity Board  er produces according to peak demands.
That's got nothing to do with recycling has it?
No.
I know but
No.
But you do you think honestly though that that really does still hold true because if everyone ha mostly having automatics now you just wash as you go you don't have a washing day or is it specially Monday they
Like I've got just automatically I wanted to do washing this morning.
Really?
I don't.
"I just put it, when it gets too bad you know if haven't got any clothes to"
It's an interesting though.
I didn't know that they produced according to peak
"Yeah, I think it's important to know"
"It's very important to know, yes."
erm  whatever.
Don't do it Monday mornings.
I usually do mine at midnight when I get home!
Yes.
A lot of people do it overnight
Yeah.
but it's not really a good idea because if something goes wrong with your machine
you're not there to deal with it.
I mean I've had mine flood and I've had its thermostat go and it boiled everything.
I mean that would have been a disaster I mean it's only because I was upstairs and I thought oh I can smell boiling.
You know it was like when you boil up hankies I thought what a!
. There was dye came out of everything it was awful.
And another time it was all pouring all over the floor
to be made out of recycling
Well  well this is what
Well at the moment it's so dear
well what he meant was
to
"th , I mean he said they"
process it.
we are not
Well
we are not dealing with anything that we cannot
In the short term.
sell.
In
Ah.
"other words they were selling glass, and they were selling  metal  back to  whatever  and manufacturers  to re-use  but  in terms of collecting and the cost of collecting it all and and"
That's expensive!
"handling all this it's, yeah."
The cost that they were  having to bear were greater than what they were actually getting back on the sale of this stuff.
"But, at the same time  the  normal sort of refuse if you like, disposable  was being reduced  because"
That's right!
these other items weren't in the normal refuse collection and therefore they were going to sort of reduce them from a weekly collection to a
Well that's if
"fortnightly collection, so they would be saving in that"
Well that  er
But not saving to these
that's if
particular firms
that
that they want.
that's if
No.
Mm.
Well Dave'll be down there today.
"Well not you can't pay on the night, can you?"
Well I suppose   I'm sure Adrian won't mind if I paid him  the day after or a week after or something.
"You're unemployed I wouldn't have thought you could've stood a hundred and fifty, two hundred pounds withdrawal."
No I don't mind  saying it I I'm not gonna ask any more.
What?
Well so that yo about Adrian  after a few weeks it's  you know
Remind me to wash in these cupboards before Sunday.
Yeah.
"Have you seen Jan and Joan dress up to their their Victorian day  Jan came like a an upright stripped  erm working, not working class a sort of governess right she had"
Yeah.
frumpy shoes and a .
Where'd she get the clothes from?
"Oh she borrowed it, and a bonnet and a  white flowers an all and Joan turned up like a  a twenty five year old Victorian fashion model  you should have seen her!"
Black silk skirt  maroon  blouse  her hair done up in a bun  draped with gold jewellery oh  talk about looking the part!
What's wrong with that?
And John hired this thing like a cape
Who's idea  is it?
Was it?
"Oh it's it's quite common, everybody does it if you have a vic if you study Victorians anyone who a Victorian   and they all they did all done out, chairs er table space at the front, they did drill in the playground  they played with tops and hoops in the playground, all the children  the m parents hired costumes from Fairy Godmothers  Fairy Godmother's done a roaring trade especially"
"Ah I should think Fairy Godmothers put the ideas into somebody's head, I would have thought."
That's not
We might
It's just a very good way of er teaching chi I mean children will I mean that's the kind of experience
Yeah.
"you never forget, do you?"
Some of  but you can't do it for something like a Medieval's day or Roman
No.
"day it'd be grim, but Victorian"
Victorian
"people have got a, yeah"
just close enough to sti still remember a lot of the cloths and stuff.
"Oh right, right, just so it's just mum and dad we're ."
Oh I need some money.
I want to believe it.
Now one of these in the morning and one at tea time.
"Twice a day, for the next week."
"One, two, three, four."
"Tell your mum she could be kinder to you, she's got to  for"
even though she's  already.
"Right oh, okay, bye Mrs ,"
Right
cheerio now.
up and call me now  A little music as well we have on the show we have a video from Elvis to give away in the second half of the programme and star guest this afternoon is Mary Whitehouse.
Oh ho ho Steeley Dan and erm reeling reeling out the thingummybobs.
Hello that's a nice way to start it isn't it?
Good morning good afternoon whatever you like to call O  never mind you know the number.
Now er we're going to start this morning talking about animals.
More specifically why we're so cruel to them.
Britain must be an animal erm a country of animal abusers looking at the statistics.
Why do we hate animals so much?
If you have a view on that O nine O four six four one six four one and I'd like to hear from you all you have to do is pick up the phone and give me a f a call  now  sorry.
"Did Karen say to somebody on that thing did I hear her say, What are you on?"
She looked at me and said that when I walked in this morning.
What are you on?
I didn't like to tell her is was Phylisan but there we are.
Anyway erm we've been hearing on this programme recently of course that er people are against hunting against fishing er they say it's cruel.
But they are willing quite willing apparently to give and receive pets as presents and millions of them end up getting abused neglected and destroyed.
Every year we see that doleful little puppy on the television screen and every year thousands of people give pets for Christmas.
The R S P C A have to pick up the pieces and they've launched a campaign to try and stop it and joining me now is Alan.
"Is this Alan Oritt, Alan?"
Correct yeah.
OK you're the Superintendent for the north east of England that covers this area too.
And the more people that know what good work we do the better.
Provision of photographic services.
Over to you my friend.
Oh.
Provision of photographic services?
Right.
"Erm just to say that, just to confirm the note sent round that erm we will only pay for any photographic services by Intercity East Coast if it has been procured using a task request form in accordance with the same way we procure any other internal B R er service."
Now.
Surely if all we want is prints off existing things all you need do is a request with a DOPACS number?
Yeah.
Surely not you know fill in a task form in for print off a couple of negs.
Is this the external
Yes.
request request for external
Mm?
services?
Well.
B b w w why?
Why can't you just use a task request form that says.
Please p
Well.
I mean
please provide
Prints off the following negative numbers
"four number eight by eight prints off these t off, off negative numbers so and so."
Splendid.
Are you gonna write
And put the DOPACS number on.
You're gonna on something.
Yeah.
Copy it to Andrew  and then Andrew knows when the I B I S invoice comes forward that it's something to be
Then he'll sign it off.
Regional railways have asked for that as well.
Have they?
Yes.
Erm that that
Well Dennis er Roger's been doing for it for Leeds North West haven't you?
He has.
Yeah.
But he's been doing it manually haven't you Rog?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Be be because I don't think you can trust the forecast reports from DOPACS.
"I think y yo you could blip from month to month er, er as a priority slipped in or changed, or a person slipped out or, or somebody forgot to zero something or y"
It's too fragile isn't it?
It's far too fragile.
Mm.
"It it's there for us to, to use as a, as a sore thumb exercise to ask questions but, but to actually do anything er, er as critical as saying, we're gonna spend twelve thousand pounds next period and eleven thousand pound the period after and fourteen thousand the period after, er I don't think that's"
computer system's tying your hands behind your back.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yes.
"So, so really"
"we're gonna have to have a manual involvement or override there by the project coordinator to, to, to"
"Well if, if you remember we, we agreed with Keith  he would have a think  that and a talk to"
Yeah.
Roy er Roy
You'd remind him about it Hugh.
Yeah.
"But what I'm gonna suggest is that again we go back to the client, and say basically, this is what we think we can provide is that good enough?"
Mm.
This is what you want.
"If we give you that we can give you it in a certain way, but it is not necessarily meaningful."
Mhm.
Oh I seem to remember something like that.
"Erm and the car just broke up in half and that was, that had been  er  welded but like the police are saying as  well as soon as they sort of get wise to what they're doing and they find a way to  er you know, get on to them, they devised something else."
"And the people doing it in these garages erm, you know like respraying and  doing all the welding and everything, really he said some of the things they were doing  if they did it legally they'd make a  good go of it"
Mm.
they were that good at what they were doing.
"Tell me was I dreaming  or did I see a sketch on T V where there's a car driving round, down the road being chased by the police  and the driver said to the passenger er here take this  and he says what's that for and he says it's to steer the car, presses a button  and the car splits"
It's an advert for Malcolm.
the car s the car split in two.
yeah.
A yellow car.
It's an advert for that film called Malcolm
Is that what it was?
about the
Yeah.
retarded lad that invented all these strange  and he did bank robberies with a remote control car.
"It was an advert, it wasn't"
But I did see it on the T V?
Oh you did.
Oh that's fine.
Straight after er  the advert for Del-boy when he says and you know what you can do with that.
Even talking about  trailers now.
Trainers?
Talking about te television trailers.
"Oh, oh yeah."
Not just the programmes.
There was a programme on about trailers the other night as well.
"Have you seen the, the advert for these trainers with no laces, you just tighten the thing up."
Puma Discus system.
They're out on the twenty  of March or something.
Mm.
I wonder how much they're gonna be a pair?
Dunno.
that yeah can I answer that
Andrew.
Now you would court martial them well I put it to the S I B
S I B what's that?
That's the Special Investigation Branch .
Special Investigation Branch.
"All the allegations I made, all the beatings I took, I'm bleeding  they investigated nothing, and what the brigadier said, the brigadier is talking nonsense."
He knows that the Army is w widespread in the Army and he .
"It's like everything else you  company commander, you tell him, he throws it out the window."
He sends you away  make you feel happy
"Do you know I've served in the Army for thirty three years and I've commanded every thing at every level in the infantry which both these gentlemen have been in, from a platoon right up now to a brig er brigade and I can honestly tell you that I haven't seen more than a couple of incidents of bullying in the whole of that time ."
You're a commissioned officer
The point is the point is that's that's a good point what you've said you don't see it.
That's the whole point.
You come at a barrack room as an officer
Mm.
"or a corp it doesn't matter,"
Mhm.
You'll see it.
with rank on your arm
Yeah.
the soldiers i that room will act a different way
I I agree.
when the door shuts
I understand that.
a different way again
they will .
"I can understand that , I can understand that."
But it's a matter leadership.
And leadership in the Army is some
Leadership has got nothing to do with it whatsoever.
Leadership
"But it's certainly er, certainly a valid question."
Yeah.
Woodrow Wilson
"Well, that's what Freud"
also  subject on.
But I know that  such a talented writer.
"You know, I mean, I was convinced that there was no such thing as religion after I'd read the book  I mean, anything I read about, I immediately say, oh yes, of course that's true, you know."
So.
"Well, next week, will be telling us about another one of these very controversial books, won't you?"
Yes.
"In which we shall be looking at, er another famous figure, but, but, er an even more remote and one, some people might say,mytho mythological one, namely Moses."
"So having done Woodrow Wilson this week, we will do Moses, next week."
We'll look forward to that.
"Is anybody Jewish, by the way?"
Right.
"Well, one year, I must admit, somebody in the class stormed out."
"The person started to read their paper on Moses, and I thought she was doing a good job of it, this guy suddenly got up and said, I'm Jewish, I'm not listening to any more of this, and stormed out."
"Oh, I don't see that."
"Erm, what is the most,"
Right.
"Er, that is in,that is in er, Hampstead,."
If you wanna get there
I'm just
"the easiest way to do it, is to take the underground to Finchley Road Station"
Finchley Road Station.
Mhm.
"And when you come out of Finchley Road Station, it's in a place called ."
"I may be able to give you a thing about it actually, if I've still got one."
"You can visit it, it's open  it's best to phone up and find out when they're open, because they're not open every day."
And they  interesting?
"Well, there's  I mean it's interesting, erm, it's Freud's you know, collection of, of classical and antique ."
"They, they give the impression that the house is the way it was when he lived there, but it's not quite true, actually, it was earlier on."
"That is  their own fault  because according to, there was a programme on there and it was saying  they, they must be selling it to these firms that recy , that use it"
Mm.
they must be selling it
Well they will do.
"them very cheap  because it was sa , this programme was on about recycling"
No thanks.
and it said  about tin cans and aluminium and that  and it was costing them less  excuse me  to use recycled  you know er  used aluminium
Mm.
and used steel cans and that  it was costing them  less to use that  than it was to use
Brand new stuff.
yeah.
Yeah.
"So, I mean  to me, I don't know whether I'm right, but  that my first thought is that they must be buying it very"
It's gotta be profitable
they must be buying it very cheap then?
Mm.
Mm.
"So, so the people that are not making any money out of it by doing it  are selling it to them very cheap  so it is their own fault!"
I think initially er
It's only it's been cheaper to
now has got a cost more  in the initial
Well it does
"stages  until it's sort of, set up, until  everyone is sort of you know  geared into doing this  kind of  you know, like all the glass goes here, all the metal goes here, all the  goes there"
"Well yes, because they're not"
"and all the companies that are responsible for  for re-using it  and all the  distribution network is set up for collecting an an sending it from here to there  you know, once that network is going then surely"
Oh yes!
it's gotta be  useful because  instead of going  you know  from one sort at one end and going out the other and never being  ever seen again  it's going
That's right!
"in a circle and, and  surely that's gotta be cheaper once a network is set up?"
"And it's a, it's an ongoing thing"
Yeah!
"You know I mean, oh oh di you know I mean  it's to theorise, I suppose but I mean all it takes really is to have  three bins."

"We know what the Conservative party thought of Michael Heseltine this week, they cheered him to the echo when he strode on to the platform at Blackpool."
But what does Michael Heseltine think of the party?
And of the direction it has now taken.
"In today's programme he gives us an exclusive interview, the first since his heart attack four months ago."
Pine pastures green to the tops of Ben Dorain and and up Black Mount where the Craig estate took it was it was in their estate.
So therefore my father was very keen to go too.
Mm.
And that's how we decided to go.
So Dalmally I should safely say was my first schooling.
Even though I was about eight and a half.
Mm.
Now your father was the the stocker at Tormore is that right ?
Yes he was the stocker at Tormore.
Who was he employed with then?
Well the estate er er er the Duke of Sutherland had the whole of Assynt and then h General Stewart who was born in Nedd and worked and made his fortune if it was as you would say in Canada on the C P R.
Canadian Pacific Railways and he was able to take a lot of people from the place he was born in  out to Canada.
Mm.
What d'ya recall of your early days with your father at Tormore?
Pardon?
What d'ya recall of your early days at Tormore with your father?
Well  he was a very active man my word he would soon go right from the house to the top of  as you would say because we had sheep then.
And if he saw a sheep that shouldn't be where they were and the gentry about to come within days he would soon get them down.
Mm.
Without a collie dog.
And well I remember hearing about it and and saw it probably as I grew up myself.
So he was  and it had it's Tormore House was really a lovely place.
Did the did the gentry come fairly frequently to the estate?
Yes.
Oh they came up with their servants all servants up from the south by train to Inverness and then a charabanc or vehicle of such that was in it then because it was only metal roads we had then.
But they were good metal roads that took all the traffic.
Well I remember at that time the steam roller that was just doing the road outside Tormore House and many's the day I was trying to get on it with a very good friend of ours that's now dead.
A Hugh .
No  relation but a great friend of ours.
He was a steam roller driver.
Mm.
And were the gentry in er Lochassynt Lodge or was it Tormore?
right John has written a story about his home  right it's a good descriptive story on how people live
until one day they couldn't think of any way that you could may improve it.
My home.
"I live in a tree house, my mum and my dad and my brother and my dog and my sister."
"Our house is made of wood and is dark green, we have a four windows and four doors."
It has got wooden roof.
"There is a big hill in front of it and it is good but erm  because we climb the, the tree and climb it and  we play in the tree house today with the dog."
"Inside our home we have a lot of furniture we have four rooms and one in the bathroom, one in the bedroom and one in and one in the lounge  and one in the kitchen here"
"Okay, right"
So if we cut out the one
they might
it might flow a bit more easily might it.
"That's good, it was alright apart from that you describe where John and"
are living well
"Yeah, I didn't see which sort of"
"No, did he describe the house though?"
Yeah
"Yeah, I think his description of where he was living in the tree house was very clear"
I think he could improve it just a bit Jonathan
"and then it might flow a bit more evenly, might it then, right Michael bring yours out now please."
"Just a minute John, right Michael I want you to read yours through once more for me please."
Do it about the monster
Monster from the marsh.
"When I saw the monster from the marsh, one night, I was, I was, I was frightened, I, I, I, I was  he looked liked a   when I saw him I ran back to camp and I felt frightened, I hid under my sleeping bag the end"
"Right, see Michael was describing that how he felt"
Yeah
How did feel then?
Frightened
You think that he came out quite
What Christine has said then do you think?

A lot of cars at the school this morning.
"I parked right on the end of the erm  the lane, just"
Mm
"in, there was just enough room for me."
Mm?
Course we were late anyway  well not late for John's but
Which way do you go
When I came back
into ?
Cos you can cut through that
"I turn round and go back, yeah."
Mm.
"And of course the coach had come up the hill  couldn't overtake where I was parked, blocking off the entrance to the lane where I'd just come out of so that the string of cars coming down the road and the first one wanting to turn in and of course the coach had covered it."
Oh yeah
It was completely blocked off  coach couldn't go backwards because there was cars behind it.
So I gingerly walked down and crept into the car realized that I was the one that had caused all that
and drove off
And ignored
Slinked off into the mist.
So he couldn't back back then
"No  no that wa that was it, completely stalemate."
"big Volvo estate was facing  if he'd go down there, I can get through and he can come back again and  he wasn't gonna do that."
Too much  brain damage
there's a big notice at the end of the lane which says
Well he'd come up from Totnes this morning.
", in olden days, before they built the er bridge."
When the all the traffic came across the level crossing there.
There's still a signal box there.
erm that's now a private house isn't it?
"Yeah, it's a listed building."
But er rather nice.
"And a barrow, a very common sight, and this this type of er of awning, erm very very common, er the barge-boarding er and the er and and the again the roof and the er chimneys and very interesting sort of a  In the garden erm of the sort of station master's house, is that."
Very much like er the style used er in coal offices and erm weigh weighbridge at .
That's still there.
"Erm where there's a caravan office, or caravan sales place just by the station, at , sorry at er ."
"Erm I remember er thinking one day, erm I must get a photograph of that er building which was clearly a erm er a coal office or similar, I'll go back at the weekend and get that."
I went back at the weekend and it was a pile of rubble.
"And that is the danger if you don't do things at the sec at the time, because er things do get er knocked down."
"Nice little building, little Wendy House there."

"Apparently we've got a mistake on the back of that form, that it referred to a noncompliance report, on the back, which is referring to the front but the front was called a quick-fix report"
you see?
"So I said, should I fill in a quick-fix report or a noncompliance report, to say that the quick-fix form, or is it a noncompliance report is wrong."
Right.
We'll get there.
Erm
He said I could leave it with him and he'd sort it out.

first mistake .
"there have been some fairly er minor alterations to the procedures concerning contract admin wallets er and the various client reports, er but Hugh did ask me to raise them at this meeting, er to remind people of the need to er complete client reports."

Right.
They do find them extremely helpful.
Have you run off
C
any interim report from t the computer yet?
"It does actually say together with other said officers and committee members as shall be determined by a general meeting, so if we wish to elect or choose somebody else we can do."
"Erm, but there's be a good idea to have"
She's taken someone's .
"Well I think, we'll, we'll see what, we'll see what comes, if somebody else wishes to compete, compete for the Chair, the post of Chair, erm, then you may perhaps like to invite them to share the Chair with you, or, or, they can become the, the Vice Chair."
"Erm, erm, only too willing to welcome competition cos they're all to aware of my short comings, mm."
Mm.
"Erm, so."
"Well, if, if there isn't anybody else who wishes to  compete with you for the Chair, er, then I think there ought to be a Vice Chair."
Yeah.
Right.
"Now the other thing about, about the meeting is erm, we sometimes arrange for sort of special refreshments or something different in that line, it's at Ann's house, erm do you want, do you want us to do anything about that Ann or?"
"Yeah, interested in any spare wine glasses please."

"and they're, obviously they would be, tend to be other children  with mothers then  so they would like perhaps a play facility there."
"And other children who go to the E N T clinic, and go to the"
"or just go to the outpatients in general, and the casualty"
Yes.
there's very limited facilities for children to play.
So  but I also coaxed Mrs  about  the Wandsbergh .
"Anyway, she  wanted to, me to go and see her, she said there we there was a scanner appeal, and she was also trying to talk about all sorts of other things that were possible  and  because there was an arts appeal and  for arts facilities at the hospital, and all sorts of things."
So  I went back to Miss  and said about the scanner appeal and she said that would be  she thought that that would be the best idea.
Not the children's things at the  Cottage Hospital.
"I also told her it's the diamond jubilee of the hospital  and  the children from  will be invited to the hospital for that day  that week, sorry."
It's gonna be a week  .
So she wanted to know what date it is.
"So I, I asked Mrs  to  but would she write to Miss  and give her all the details."
"And she said, oh she'd be, she'd be far better if she went to see and explained it all."
"And that she was going on Wednesday, I think."
Up she went  you know
Hold on.
Which one was going to see which
It's

"But on a  but there's nothing ready of course, so th there's, there's a  giant sundial they're going to have in one of the courtyards  and it's a giant one  it's, it's the, the building and the blocks of  things in, in the  in the courtyard that make up the  the time."
"So the sun shines on the that particular bit of the  of the courtyard and it's eight o'clock, and that one is nine o'clock and so forth."
Alright

Okay so putting all the  that positive
Yeah sort of ums and ahs
Oh right okay okay so I mean are are you saying that's about confidence?
Is it or  ?
"Well maybe , maybe, maybe thinking ahead too much"

"Yeah I mean you're trying to think ahead, you're umming and ahing"
So effective preparation

But certainly the main co-ordinators er
"Almost like the burglar alarm  you just have scheme, head co-ordinators, you know deputy co-ordinator, number of 'ouses and that just a basic so you go in"
We we don't want really is street co-ordinators because
No
that'd be a mammoth task
If you have somebody like  somewhere like that
"I'm not talking about that, I'm now talking about Tollerton but it's eight hundred properties, it's a small village but there are twenty seven street co-ordinators, so you know"
Erm yeah so say all you need is just access to that field so if they do change you can just
At the moment you do I take it you're recording people who sort of ring up say I'm interested you send out a package to them you record them
Yes
"I would think about giving up that, send the package out and forget about them"
"Well, this is something I've just done myself"
Yeah
"but I mean you send the package out and you get a phone call er it's Mr Davies, and then you get card out and then you send him the questionnaire it's merely a record duplicated on the form but"
"it's, I can't see any other way to do it at the moment, I mean probably when I"
Yeah
"think about it, but"
I mean you don't start a file at that stage do you?
No just a card in er a pending tray and that's it
"So you know who they are, yeah"
Er a sheet of paper for Tracy to get the initial erm  out and then they just go through the system
And you also get sometimes two people off the same street
Well that's it
It's just a reference they want you  Mr Smith two doors away
Well I've had one for Basingfield or Basingfield
"Oh I spoke to her, yeah"
"yeah, I've had three applications all for the it's only a small village albeit it's spread"

You know for the er village
"Well have you spoken to Sergeant  to alleviate all the paperwork, and"
yeah yeah
and they had to they had to sit in rows and they had to do as they were told and they weren't allowed
Ha!

Yes.
Apparently some of the children got quite scared of Jan cos Jan played the part so well  ah Joan  for life.
Frightened the life out of them.
Yeah.
Ah back ah back ah back and bill .
So what did John look like perhaps like a little Billy Bunter didn't he?
"Ah no he looked very good he had a gown and a mortar board and cane  and bow tie  and pin striped socks, quite good, yep."
And they wore that all day all of them all day?
"All day and then he got  all to do   at lunch time  yeah they kept it up all the day, they had separate play time, they had had to eat their lunch in the class room  all they were allowed was a piece of fruit, a bread and water  and they all had to have, you know, they had a bread roll  supplied by the school  an a an apple I think    And Jan made them write out their names and some of them couldn't write their name!"
Boy called Daniel couldn't write Daniel cos all last year he'd been allowed to put Danny  an he'd forgotten how to write Daniel!
Search me!
How old's that child?
Ten  and John
And he can't
"that's what's so dreadful, Joe was language coordinator and they came from her!"
Can't write names.
And another boys name was Thomas   and he couldn't write that cos all last year he'd been Tom  an he'd forgotten how to write his surname  they're not dim children  both of them
Frightening isn't it?
family  she says  quite an eye opener  an they had write lines if they did anything wrong  one boy just   I reckon she could carried him but
No.
You can't be  three times    Where's tonight gone?
All this stuff in out here shall I?
"You think you're exhausted after a days work imagine if you've been doing that all day long, shouting"
Look!
"and shrieking, no I mean that"
I shout and shriek all day long!
Ooh I'll lose my voice up there today  we've done some really good things though  try and do see more my hall is very full  if he bothered to come to school he'd have seen them!
Still  find those  what's this that's broken from?
But Mummy you could
"Well,actually  and it might be based on a true story, don't know if it"
"Do you remember when Vaughan was, Vaughan was doing his meditation"
Yeah.
"and he was trying to get in touch with a North American Indian, that a, thingamy in Wales was fixed up"
.
Wonder what ever came of that.
"Always very hard to talk to Vaughan about things like that, because you asked a straight forward and he goes way, way, over the head"
"Yeah, I know , he does versify."
and within three seconds my brain just switches off .
Well I try to
.
"I, I just ask him if, and it, the question that I'm interested in the answer to, like how did it go? and, now he talks at me for an hour until Diane comes in and says enough Vaughany,cos she can see I sort of trying to edge away"
"suddenly cross your legs, ouch ."
That's a good idea.
"She said to me just say to him like I do enough Vaughany, don't want to hear any more."
"I said no, I, I would hate to offend him because it's all so well meant  being a mother in law you have to watch it."
", honestly you couldn't be much worse than ."
Oh  mother in law is.
.
She's just .
"I'm not buying her a present, I mean I'll chip in with a present for you for her and Mark if it comes, but we'll have to go to , but erm, you know, she,."
"As a person, you know, I'd never have any time ."
"Yes, yes, I mean you never, she lives in that great place and she's got no money"
", they're not, they're not her presents are they, they're from Diane."
"No, of course, of course ."
"So, I tell you what, if, if we do end up spending Christmas at  gonna give me the present I got to Di and said thank you Di for giving Stella the  Christmas present ."
It so .
I mean as an acquaintance I could tolerate her but I .
I couldn't I'm afraid.
"Well, could do, what I can't forgive is that she was so spiteful to my daughter, she's a sun shiny little sole and she's so full of love for everybody she's so generous"
Why was she?
she didn't want Vaughany to get married again.
"There you can see the staging, and that is where the er wagons came in along here."
More pictures of the roof timbers.
"Outside, that was some stabling I think there."
And er internal roof-work of the stabling.
Just er recessed there to avoid it getting damaged with things passing on the side.
And we're now now walking round the back and er sort of now pointing towards the  Arms.
And you'll notice the er er again the brickwork and the buttressing along there.
"Now having just walked away er up towards erm  er  crossing end, there's the ."
And that's the remains of the cattle dock here.
Er I'm afraid a lot of it had gone by that time.
That was to hang Mr  on.
Or Dr .
"In fact there're two of them, there and one there."
And that's erm  crossing house up there.
And you can see that's where the main tracks where and this is of course where we had er sort of sidings and er other things and er and the main yard.
"Erm odd pictures of the engine shed, taken from somebody's back garden I suppose now."
Er but you can see the er the the engine shed as it was.
Single road.
Accommodate er one locomotive only.
"They normally had here, er just the one erm locomotive  little O four four tank engine, Johnson."
Erm built before the turn of the century.
And and er they also had er normally a little O six O tank er which was er spent a lot of it's time at er a at  at the what is what is now  er Castle.
Er shunting there.
"As I say, that er train would nip off to Nottingham I think every Monday I think it was, and get vacuum cleaned out."
Er and then return.
"what I've never seen, there's the that's the er tank, water tank at the top."
"What I've never seen, is a photograph from the other end."
"If anybody can tell me what was at the other end, apart from a hole, then  not carefully, er I'd be very grateful."
I I guess there was probably a lean to or something like that.
"But er i just don't know, maybe erm a sand store."
"But as I say, I've never seen anything, and I've never been able to find anybody who can provide that answer for me."
"There is a coal truck, that was parked there, and they would load up coal er from there as as necessary."
"I said well what you do in your private life it's up to you  if you want to get drunk  and you want to spend money  then that's fine  but once you step over  that clock tower I said and you start interfering with my work it's a different thing, I said well I've   and I've just said nothing because  although you ain't worked right, at least you've sort of you've work in this factory sort of in the morning, you've got over it but"
and then
Yeah
.
there's been disaster tonight  ain't gonna put up with it!
So what he say?
Didn't say anything.
"I said you know, I think you've gotta sort yourself out Lee  and everybody went sort of quiet  but  Paul said  I've never had a rollocking!"
"I said well in all fairness Paul, you ain't actually  bloody got , I said I don't do it for the fun of it  I said and I don't like doing it  but I see, he just sort of"
Well that's silly comment  can't be doing him any good!
I said well the thing  is discipline.
If grandma went
If the transport
into the  she'd  sherry each.
Cor!
I said if the transport get that load of L T M thrown back  Robin is gonna get it right in the neck!
And if Robin gets it in the neck  I shall get it in the neck  and I shall be getting it in the neck because of you!
So I said I think
Well then what did he say?
"I said I can assure mate, I said I shall make sure there's hell to pay!"
I said but I shall be wrong  for not saying anything about you coming to work drunk.
So I said I'll leave you to think about that.
"Well he must of had that amount  he must be contin , he must have alcohol in the body  continuously."
"Of course he has  he was drinking Saturday afternoon to Saturday night, Sunday afternoon and the Sunday night  not Monday night  but  again last night."
So he never gets over it does he?
And he went to bed half past  two.
And got up at four.
"Before then I should think, quarter to four."
I should think he looked like nothing on earth did he?
Yeah.
Well he's gonna kill his self isn't he?
That's right.
Yes .
Yes.
"So you're really, in a way, you're not much difference than where you started."
"I think Margaret's right, if, if we really want to get through the business we can and however busy we are, erm ."
"I wouldn't we wouldn't to  every time, but I mean it can be, it can be just a very brief report on what's happened, you know, if we want to get through."
"If we said, like, if we, every second month say or every third month, then we, we knew we were going to have a speaker, we could the time before we could then do the business more thoroughly and carefully so that the month of the speaker we could just go through it very quickly ."
.
"Alternatively to, alternative to, to speaker, can we get erm, you know, brief films about different countries and, political systems and so on."
Mm.
"Yes, yes we have the video too, we have, we have the erm the Amnesty video and we, there are, there are schools videos to."
"Do, do, do they do different videos for different countries?"
"Not, they're not, no, the one I've, the one the group has is, is a general one it's on Amnesty's work ."
"Oh, I see ."
"Yeah, yeah, there probably are ones on different countries."
"I'm not sure that Amnesty does produce on, on, one particular country."
"erm, we have."
other organisations that
"Yes they might, yes, mm."
Though even that's the sort of thing that on T V that er
We can video ourselves.

"Yes, there are a lot, mm"
There's all these workshops Margaret.
"Yes, I, I, I have about twelve workshops."
.
On all kinds of things.

"On all kinds of things, yes."
I enjoyed that very much that last one.
What was that one?
I bet they don't dispense much of that now because most people buy it over the counter don't they?
"Oh their own, yes"
I mean you're not going to spend three pound forty on a prescription if you can get a bottle for about one pound fifty  so
where you do it
so well where you gonna go for that?
Where else can you try?
Er well I was gonna ask for
"when he comes, gonna ask or ask"
At the college do you mean?
"They seem to know about it, the ones who live in that area  and"
the chemist
Mm
he's an old fashioned type
Well why don't you try Mr Bentley I mean
He's bloody finished now
"Well the shop's closed, but erm, he might be able to tell you somewhere nearer than"
"to get it, I mean he's very obliging."
He lives over the shop still doesn't he?
Or at the back of the shop.
He's a proper character isn't he?
Mm
"But erm he might be able to er oblige you, he was certainly one of the last of the old breed of chemists I think"
"a tissue in machine, bits dropping in and out"
"Look in the pockets you great pi , oh"
I think there's probably one inside a pillow case knowing you
"Oh jesus, Maggots  I caught a few"
there might be a fiver in one of them
You've got no chance of that
Hey did you know this
Yes  oh god  Muffin you're not going out again you're covered in mud.
"I suppose they get fed up stuck in all the time, don't they?"
"Yeah, and they're only out for a few minutes and they're fed up out there as well, and backwards and forwards like a fiddlers elbow  go on  I want to put those lupins in"
With me so far?
Mm.
But not all of those hundred must vote for the must vote for the closure there must be a hundred people there to take part in the vote is that right?
No.
It is no good putting a closure vote by ninety nine to one or even ninety nine to nought.
The objector cunningly doesn't vote.
We must have a hundred MPs voting for the closure.
All of it ah right okay.
So we need a hundred  present.
Which is where  on a Friday afternoon.
But if if everybody else around the country has been lobbying as hard we have there's a good chance.
After all there's three hundred and three hundred and however many was yes three hundred and sixty MPs who supported it.
Three hundred and twenty seven put their name to an easy end.
So out of those we should be able to manage a hundred surely.
The other thing is if we're successful with Atkins if he's behind the bill the MPs are unlikely to talk it out.
They'll accept it and put send it through on the nod if we can get his support.
So he's crucial.
Why is the Whip so important?
Because surely he's just enforcing the Minister's policy.
Erm yes.
But these people get together.
Right.
I mean it's not as if Robert Atkins  making all the decisions.
"Three hundred people say hang round the bar and say,conservation board I've had lots of letters, well so have I, we'll get get through them they might cause trouble."
That that's the plan.
Well go for democracy the decision being you know for the country being taken by three
Tories rather than
Well that's right yes rather than one.
Well they don't ask John Major of course.
. They can tell  John Major .
So why I'm I'm slightly puzzled as to why Robert Atkins is actually more important than John Selwyn Gummer?
I mean
"Er, Brian , is also a regional director for Belfast and the serving areas of Belfast as well, okay?"
"He has sole responsibility for Belfast, but he does have regional directors going to  but Brian tends to cover a general manager role and  with  with erm  Dick ma ,."
"No, not Dick , who's in er  Belfast?"
"Tom, Tom ."
Yeah.
"And er  himself, run the Belfast operation  across all the regions."
"But sometimes, because he doesn't have hundreds of depots I think he's not regional, but that's my own fault."
Brian  is the Northern Ireland region.
Well done.
"Do get a, er buy a map, spend some money to get one."
You may have in your depot  you may have in your depot a map which  have pinpointed the T N T depots.
"Does any, has anybody seen one yet?"
Yeah.
The big wa waterproof one which you can draw on?
Yes.
Yeah.
"They're, er, well they're not waterproof"
Well
but they're coated aren't they?
"Er, so you can wipe them clean if er, you use a special pen."
"But, what I'm saying is, if you, salesmen particularly get one, you'll need one to get round the country  your patch, but you need to get familiar with the towns up and down the country  for deli , for delivery, cos your customers will talk about the area and you're talking to someone from a transport café, you haven't got a clue where the towns are."
"I mean, you know, where's your credibility?"
And write down erm  it.
"I know north of border, nothing happens south of the border and like but, but we do deliver down here so  do, do give yourself a little practise of that."
Now  I'm going to ask you to do another little test for me.
"Simple questions, ten questions, alright?"
"Do you want ta , tidy up your little bit of paper out the way again?"
And there's ten questions about the conditions of carriage.
Name on the top of the list.
Now  how many people have not seen a list of the
carriage yet?
Er erm
"Manhom believes that, believes what basically?"
"They look, er round that line, two three five  two three six  and Face is saying  you're very right sir."
She is a very rare scholar
"describing Doll Collan here, a whore who is seen wandering around the stage most of the time,she is the most rare scholar and has gone mad with studying Brampton's works."
And here but name a word such in a Hebrew she falls in her fit and will discourse her learned genealogies as you would run mad too to  to hear her sir .
"Now, so, Face is trying to sort of put off Sir Epicure Manhom by saying, you know, this a mad woman who's done too much learning  nice little attack on women here by Johnson, who, who  is one of the biggest misogynists in the world, erm  a woman who's gone crazy with learning  and who knows nothing because er she's just a prostitute and therefore she's thick."
Okay?
That's the joke.
"But th again, the funny thing is, even funnier, is that  Manhom lusts after her, gets distracted from this idea of getting all this money and sa saying,how am I going to have conference with her, Lungs ?"
"Erm  and Face said,Oh!"
For a mad woman   acceptance of her .
Okay?
"So, Face promises to get an introduction  to this woman who Manhom fancies and erm  and Manhom, okay."
That is the background.
"Next time we see them  they, they have met and  and Face sends them off to have a private conference."
Okay?
"So you now have act four, scene five."
Enter Doll and th they're talking.
"Will you please try and act it out like we did the Twelfth Night  the bit with Mrs , and see whether you can revive your idea of why  Johnson, what is the nature of, of Johnson's comic art."
Okay.
But hear guffaws  within minutes.
Right.
Do you want me to divide you up?
"Are you,do you want  class ."
You ne need four in a group.
There's gonna be one over so somebody be the walking around peasant.
I don't mind  right now.
Just move my mike.
I think one of you lot's gonna have to go over and join these three over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go on.
That's fine
your using a name.
Oh no.
He's responsible.
No.
"Because within, within our, within our procedures and our quality systems, the word project engineer crops up quite a lot."
Project team
Yeah.
"But it's, it's not defined as er an M S two or an M S three."
"I mean take the example that Hugh is always using, is that if I wanted to knock a wall through, a hole through that wall and put a door in there with a link in it surely to goodness we"
Right.
don't need an M S two.
If that's
Mm.
"the case then can I suggest that we define within our quality systems, that project engineers will be M S twos or above, for check categories of zero or above, and that for jobs with a category of double zero"
Oh no.
they can't be beneath
"Very, making it very rigid."
Yes.
You see what our policy is M S two except b except by exception.
"For instance erm we would give certainly the better M S ones the smaller jobs to project manage, but that has to be very carefully thought about."
Project engineer.
Project engineer.
That's right.
What happens if everybody wants to
panel view this
Now I would imagine if we had suggested
In broad terms
I would imagine that if we'd suggested that project engineering duties would beco
Could be done at M S one
At M M S one and S T O
Thank you.
I don't know why they bother.
"There's a signal box, from which the other picture was taken."
No doubt a lamp and  store there.
"Er this taken from where the signal box used to be, and that's where the line out to  is over there."
"There's hardly a trace of it, whoops."
And there you see er  really that was the old erm remains of the platform going towards er .
That's all that's left.
And again that's the  er er platforms as it is now looking towards .
Oh and they sorry the other way round.
That's the other end of it.
"And the er house there,."
Quite a fair erm service on the Nottingham Lincoln line.
Erm there's a sort of typical timetable of the nineteen twenties.
". Now moving over to to , er what is  Castle now, used to be quite a nice er well the the actual building   Erm that building is still here, and the bulk of that er station building is still there, er but erm I'm afraid all the er the buildings this side have gone, erm and er a lot of this has a lot of this has gone."
Again you you've got er lamps erm and water columns and barrier here.
"In the background, erm a big goods shed which is still there."
I think er it won't be long before that goes I think.
"There you can see, early B R days, erm as it shows it's  Castle, it wasn't  Castle, it was just  in the old days."
Water tower here.
There was never a turntable at er at .
"Er but er rather nice er buildings here, and er canopies, which I say have been completely er removed."
And er the level crossing of the old A one used to be here.
"The goods shed at the back, and the train just coming in from Lincoln there."
And the old semaphore bracket signal there.
"Er in B R days, a lot of the er traffic between Nottingham and Lincoln and Derby, er was hauled by locomotives from Lincoln depot, and when the erm  Region took that over, they closed the  or the  er shed down and used erm er Lincoln  region locomotives."
"This is an old  express passenger four four O, director class."
Er in York station erm on a er Lincoln to Derby train.
"Erm very attractive er locos they were and extremely successful, they were the mainstay of er the er er  line, and er outperformed many of the Robinson four six Os er that were built subsequently."
"Erm very attractive building, and I think in fact ten years ago when I took that photograph."
Erm I don't think it's changed much.
coming back er along the line.
And that's how it was in earlier days.
"Okay, I think, I think that is, that is a point."
"Again, that came up this morning as well."
That
"Shakespeare's so central to our heritage i you learn him at O level, you learn him at A level, you get used to him."
"Erm  he's part of our language  and, and therefore, you know, to go on to Johnson it's very different."
"Like you say, it takes much more time to get into it."
But I think Johnson does make it harder for us.
There are no characters to get involved with  as the there are in  in Shakespeare.
We can't really imagine ourselves  you don't really have sympathy for any of the characters in the .
They're all  fairly sort of silly characters.
"Whereas in, in Twelfth Night or whatever, we might actually feel involved within the, the people in the play."
Certainly .
"Okay, well I'll leave all those up there."
"Erm  can you look at scene, act four, scene five in my edition."
Now I discovered this morning there is actually act four scene three in some people's editions.
Okay?
"Erm, so act fi act four, scene five."
"And the stage direction at the beginning of this, enter Doll in her bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom."
Has everybody got that scene?
Enter Doll in bitter talking with Sir Epicure Manhom.
Okay.
Can you divide yourself up into groups of four first of all please?
"I'll do it for you if you, you want?"
And leave a bit of space.
Right.
"For those who aren't totally sort of in control of the plot  and I probably should include myself as one of them, what's happening in this scene I want you to act out."
What's happening in this scene?
"Doll  is a prostitute, okay?"
First things first.
"Who is working with  Sottle  who's planning to be the alchemist, okay?"
So he's probably fiddled a lot of things  to get money from people.
"The alchemist is getting money, I'm sorry, for people who know this  inside out, but I'll just explain it."
All round erm it was great.
We had our presence.
It's a very effective direct piece of lobbying and at a time when a lot of people who obviously weren't Green Party supporters behind the campaign.
The cross party campaign for the for the bill which we've written.
So.
the only political party ever to have two pieces of legislation in the House of Commons without having any M Ps.
I'd just like to second that it was a good day and also to point out as the er man who made the postcards we shouldn't get too excited about this as a money making scheme.
Because most of that three pounds thirteen's probably been paid for out hundreds of sheets of cardboard.
So.
But considering considering we were we were
Didn't make a loss.
I held ten fifteen pounds for the privilege.
relation thing.
Every time I do a stall I I quake in my boots up until I do it and then I feel great when we're doing it and afterwards realize that it's been  productive and we we've had a good lot a good response from the public.
So there we go.
Helen do you want to tell us about the next stage?
Yes.
Seeing as we all filled in our postcards ages ago we can write some more letters this week.
Or tomorrow.
I can give you a list of people to to write to.
First of all there's Robert Atkins M P.
This is the man who erm replaced erm Mr Yeo
Oh yes.
with his trousers down.
"Now I think erm Ron  was a bit upset because he spent most of of Christmas sending  Christmas cards and saying, Please please let this bill go through don't give it any ."
"And he said, Oh alright then what's your wife like."
Erm however
No that's right.
Erm Tim erm you know having desi have design?resigned  he was followed by Robert Atkins MP for South Riddle.
Now Mr Atkins former job is as Minister in Northern Ireland so he's unlikely to know a lot about what was going on in the in the Commons at the end of last session which is a bit unfortunate.
He's been hiding under a under an agreement.
He should at least be a very effective man.
But they would never take 'em out for day
"No, I know."
"But they would fetch 'em and pay for them, and I even today, you cannot buy love."
No.
"And it's proven my point, our Dawn wouldn't even think about  there."
Our our Corinne goes round when she got to.
Don't think about what.
Our Corinne don't only go round when she got to.
She goes round
Goes round  weeks ago.
"Well, she won't go and stop."
Said she won't go and stop again.
Who's gonna stop then.
When we were all on about stopping
"I don't mind going and doing her shopping and bits, she says, I'm not stopping."
Yeah.
"When you were on about that love, what pa was saying about, you know, like every night, that our kids, when, they had their pyjamas on, and they're like, to get hold,I'm lying watching television, I'm usually falling asleep, but I put the kids,you know."
"And er, last time I I get in touch, me mum told me,turned round and says to me, I don't want  any more mum, I says why, he says, oh she won't let me have pillow  and then I then I think if summat else  brought to light, I  kill her"
Yeah.
if she had come in
Yeah.
"and that, I know it's a filthy old thing, but it it's comfort ain't it."
Yeah.
"And when they start  let them have the pillow down, they don't feel, they can't get comfortable."
"I know it's a little bit trivial like, but it's just, it's still"
She has queer ways me mother.
"Karen I I'm forty-seven and I can't work me mother out, so, no chance for you working her out, few years you've known her."
"No no, I I, I mean, she's always been alright with me really, I mean,y you know, she's not  not at all mother-in-law, she's not"
"Well, me and me mum's, me and me me mum's never been close."
"It were always like, me and our Colin were more or less with me dad, and our Margaret and John were more or less for me mum."
"Then when they got older, me dad sort of took our John on, because our John were mechanical minded, and our Colin got pushed out a bit, 'cos our Colin weren't interested in cars."
I found this.
oh shit.
"said, he said, yeah, he said, it'll be ideal in here, he said, I can put, he said, put a full lock on door, and he said, I can come in here, he said,and so I thought, ah."
"Yeah but, there's not many people that you can"
"Sasha, behave."
I don't think I know anybody that hundred per cent 'appy.
"Well, I think it's got a lot to do with the climate we're living in, you know,"
Rushing about
"There's that much, there's that many people out of work, there's and"
"you know, there's that many pressures on people."
"I mean, it's like like Colin and I, I mean, like we're happy but then, no were not hundred per cent happy at all,But like, er, like some people I can't  if you get upset, some people eat more, some people eat less, or you know, some go into recluse, some get  and like Colin,"
"he's when he's depressed, he's goes like a raving sex mania, he"
"I'm bloody glad Albert don't, he'll drive me  out of a bed."
"He takes all, takes all his"
Why didn't you stop
No I think every
I think everybody's got themselves summat some faults.
Nobody's hundred per cent perfect.
"I mean, I don't think Colin's unhappy where he wants to do, then an offers an offer, like either they go in and make  share, but if they work all day."
"No, it's not er, it's so much  I mean, he's at work all day,and he works all bloody hours that God sent, when they want, when they got down,"
Yeah.
and what happens.
"He's got to build an office where he can go and let, sit in it, can't abide"
That's right.
Summat wrong somewhere.
Now look at our Margaret and Peter.
"They've got no family, so they've got no pressures like that, they haven't got any money problems  well they're not 'appy."
They live two entirely separate lives.
"Yeah, I know."
There's is just a marriage of er convenience.
Convenience.
Innit it.
"Yeah, it's convenient"
"Come on, there are rude words in there."
I mean
I grinned at farts.
Good!
Okay.
"Brunt, and a bit of a  at the moment."
Erm
"I mean Shakespeare did not, correct me if I'm wrong, use words like fart and, certainly doesn't use words like fuel gauge, have a leg over things like that, and things like, okay?"
So it's rude language.
Which is funny.
"I mean, we are all er very sympathetic at the end of the twentieth century, but, you know, we can still laugh when somebody says fart on stage."
Erm  there are other examples of that.
"You'll be glad to know that  in line four and five,What to do?"
"Lick figs out of my   he's actually saying lick piles  from my  and, you know the audience replies  fig  fig ."
"And the actor could, you know, draw attention the part of the anatomy he's talking about."
"I mean, this is not"
"this is not his sense of humour but it is visual, it involves the audience."
"Like, if you break off a line like, lick figs out of my  something, you're getting the audience going because the audience is supplying the  rude bits."
Okay?
Any other  things that were a problem about that clip?
Okay.
Forget that funniness.
Why is it different from Shakespeare?
What's the difference between that opening scene  and say the opening scene  in Twelfth Night or Winter's Tale?
Were they di different?
There's no asides  view.
Right.
That's another problem actually I hadn't thought of that.
"It's all  but everybody's  erm  everybody's involved from the word go, so  and the structure the  so think about that point."
"No, are no asides."
"Erm  I suppose there are later on in the play er th characters speak to each other and say very good that stupid berk over there kind of aside, but  what you don't get is  any structures of characters  as such."
You never get told what different characters are like  in th er by somebody else.
"There was not the money, we were forced to."
As I say the present day er premier just now is actually trying to do the same thing as a repeat performance
"So sort of erm what was, was there erm any victimizations or anything like that, from the bosses when you went back to work?"
"Oh immediately there was a victimization in the pit,o the pit was out."
Mm.
It was er taken there .
"The grievance was taken to the union, the union just say er told the steward who belonged to that particular pit there, right, just call the men out, that's it."
S so erm did  presumably are quite strong like that then?
Oh oh yes oh yes it was one of the be it still is one of the best unions.
Still is one of the best  for sticking
mm.
Was there erm I've forgotten what I was going ask you.
Er mm were there erm many strikes at the time?
"Oh no, oh no, oh there were all v very few and far be there may have been local strikes but, such as one day er a grievance been put in and the men struck work just for it."
But immediately the  get a result.
"So all our lads are more or less, that was lightning strikes and finish off."
Mm.
One day and it was finished you know?
"Because that would  union, you see?"
Did you work in the pits for a long time?
I was five years in the pits.
Mhm.
"Er eh in er in Lanarkshire and Motherwell, and er at that time, being a young lad  no more between er f er fourteen and twenty, I realized then  that wasn't going to be a life for me."
So I then decided that I would join the army.
Now I joined the army.
"I served my time in both India, Palestine, Gibraltar, Egypt and these sort of places abroad and when I, I  nine months of my colour service to finish, which were a twelve year service,when war broke out in nineteen thirty nine."
I then went er across to France with the B E F. Was in France about nine months approximately when the big invasion started in Poland and through France.
I was taken prisoner of war at Saint Valerie for a few of my friends in from Edinburgh who were taken prisoner of war.
I was taken to a main camp called Lamstor camp in er Polish er German border.
"And er you, you know what happened then?"
I was back down hole again.
"For another five years work, so I served five years in Germany too as a, as a miner."
"And if one goes back er and think about that wages were probably no more than two pounds a week on average, at that time, the er share capital of the Rail Railway I think I'm right in saying, was four hundred and fifty million pounds at that time."
Quite a concern.
"They had hundreds of thousands of employees, of horses and er everything."
Er massive organization.
"And of course if you strip everything that's profitable out of it, like the erm er the railway air services went, erm the er  the er erm hotels, ferries, everything else you can think of, you're left with er with a runt that doesn't make money, and not surprisingly the government then closes it down."
Still I'm mustn't get too political must I.
Er but you know you can always close things if you want to.
"Erm you can fiddle the books, I know that very well."
Another picture  show the  here a little bit here.
"Erm some of the a adverts in er our sort of parish magazines and and so on, er fifty sixty seventy years ago, some of the names,still there."
"Motor Company, well that used er that erm er that's the er ."
"Er  's, well they were well known, very big shop in the town they had."
Erm where Lloyd's is isn't it.
Now then Samuel .
"Some of  's wagons, delivering coal to Mr  's house, well no it was erm  's Manor, it was before Mr  came there."
"Er but erm that was er the Baron's house of course at one time in the eighteen, early eighteen hundreds."
Now a snow scene.
"Samuel , this was taken from an advertisement in one of the magazines, and one sometimes got a little bit of er of exaggeration."
"Er not quite certain how many he had, he had at least one wagon I know that."
"Erm very common, you know s seventy three, twenty five, eighteen, erm they very often started at sort of seventy three or something like that."
To give the impression  before.
Erm I say I don't know how many he did have.
Erm er but that er is a model of one that I made.
Er and er I I think it's a fairly accurate representation.
"Erm that is er four millimetres to the foot, erm so not very big."
But that's on to scale there.
I I work to a pretty  scale on these things.
eighteen point eight three millimetres between the tracks.
"'s  and all the rest of it, and er pictured just by the er er just by the station master's house."
I'll stop in about five minutes if that's alright.
Fine.
"Erm again,L M S yard there, residents  ."
"historically with  what's happened is, the  design from Japan was taken under licence"
Yeah.
and they were based around  and and  designs.
Yeah.
"Now on the five fifty series for example, it's an  complete cartridge spindle on the twelve thousand revs, yeah?"
And we get you know so Anthony  would get that business.
Because complete spindles come under the precision range of products .
Yeah.
This is something I was trying to get clarified but I don't care really as long as somebody gets it.
Erm  but what happened then is er  tended to get the main bearing supply for the normal spindles that  manufactured and built.
Mm.
"And that was a set of three angular contact ball bearings, and then a N N thirty double row roller at the rear."
"Er we're now doing this partnership which was what today was about, about the new generation spindle."
Yeah.
"Erm so that's going great, I think that's really going well so the new design, I think we're well in on."
"Erm the old on that you know, took me two years to get the bearings approved and er you know but then having to wait a year and a half cos  had a year and a half's worth of orders on 'em and promised to hold the price for three years is that's what it took for them to use them up, er has run out, new orders have been put on  but I've got the chance of taking the business."
"Er but erm obviously with the  thing again, I wanted er obviously"
What was the
"you don't to go to 'em for  and they say, well you just took the bloody off me, I want a cut in me ."
Yeah.
This is this is
You know I don't want to be seen to be
This is clearly er erm a situation where erm we must not knowingly take business which we have not enjoyed before at a price below
No at a price below  the existing suppliers ninety four prices.
Now when erm you say  are supplying at the moment.
Mhm.
Yeah.
"The problem is Dave , the buyer at , is worse than Ken   ."
He's a real dipstick.
Yeah?
W his last comment.
"Wh what happened is, Richard  was the team section leader, Dave  historically looks after the bearings sales."
Nowadays I mean I know there never used to be apprenticeships for women but
"Well I don't know if there are any women, I couldn't tell you whether any girls have applied to be like trainee tenters, that's people that sort"
Mhm.
the looms.
"Or, the trainees in our department would be female anyway."
Mhm.
"And the way the management work in here,I can say is they,aim they're promoting anybody to a chargehand they usually promote somebody that's actually no threat to themselves."
"There's a kind of yes man, that, that's the way the carpet industry works in general."
Mhm.
They don't promote somebody that's gonna shimmy past them up the corporate ladder although  you couldn't
say this place
"is a, a giant corporation ."
Mhm.
Aha.
"But sometimes I, I do feel that the girls, I, I know a couple of people in other departments that you could say would do the job equally well as the man they've put in, they probably"
Aha.
have bu be a better grounding.
Aha.
Yes.
"But I saw that in the glazier and  when I worked in there, they would bring people in."
Mhm.
Oh
M
they wouldn't promote?
"No, er, if you had a degree,"
Aha.
"and you absolutely no knew nothing about producing plain bearings you were sitting in the chair and probably a guy that worked his way through the factory floor who knew the job inside out, he was still"
a deputy.
Aha.
but because er you maybe had a degree well you get in there and you have to start
Mhm.
learning all this but you didn't know all the
I
"no I can't, no not there"
Let's have it then
"No, no you can't love, because"
We've done it at work
"Go on then  that is the same thickness as that in there, that is"
What's that there then?
"That's what that, that's come off there that has"
Well you pull it out don't you?
"Go on then you try and pull it out of us, that's what I'm trying to do look"
you want a pair of pliers do you?
"Have then, it's harder than what you think it is this"
Ah?
It's harder than what you think it is this
"Oh, I wonder why this was"
yeah
"I suppose that's why it went, sucking it up properly  I suppose she had it riding up"
had a tug at it and that's what rips it I suppose
Yeah
I'll get you a pair of pliers?
"You can get, you can get, you can get whatever you like darling, but you won't get that in there pliers, you won't get that in there, what I'll try and do is get a"
"What about cut through, what do you reckon?"
Well
"With that, let's have a go"
Want a cup of tea?
I suppose you've been whistling today
No
"Well we'll have to do upstairs, hoover that much longer"
Why's that then?
Oh cos when I've been doing it
"has been up there nattering, it's been noticed, so Norren come up to me today and she said oh er you don't have to do upstairs she said, give it a couple of weeks she said and you won't have to do it any more"
Why's that then?
But you can't back out of the whole rehearsal
"I mean I've backed out of going, having, I'm supposed to be working on that on the stalls as well but I backed out of that and said I've got a hair cut, erm, so I'll have to be done last."
"It's not, it's not gonna go on very long is it?"
"Yes, er probably until about half four"
"Well that's alright, she ain't she's not here till half three in any case"
"Yeah, you'll have to come home a bit er, a bit er"
Yes I know
She's  so this'll probably be our last appointment here wouldn't it?
"No I was saying to her  I'd probably have one more before I go anyway and er  I'm, I'm gonna ask her if she  with my, cos at that nana's there, I mean there'll be four of us there, it might be worth an hour and a quarter drive"
What her?
She wouldn't wanna drive an hour and a quarter
"Well she might not, she might do"
"She wouldn't drive an hour and a quarter, it's not worth it"
"Well we haven't much choice, we'll have to arrange something else that's all, mm I don't, I don't wanna give her up, she's a good hairdresser"
Well you can hardly ask her to drive round and er an hour and a half
An hour and a quarter
for twenty quid
"It's not twenty quid, if Melanie and I have our hair permed, that's, that's two perms and two, two cuts"
And granny have it done
Possibly
dad can have it done
Possibly
nice family outing
Er if she was to come over
Saturday
"No, no, no"
she won't do that
"but she could, I dunno perhaps we can work something out, I dunno, er failing that we'd have to come out to her house"
"Oh right, yeah, I'd rather go up the road, stupid"
"I know, but she's really good though, I be shall sorry to erm, have to give her up"
"oh dear, see that tutor tomorrow morning for an hour, hey hey"
"What, get the job er copied up then"
Let er let's hope it'll mm  won't be like that er mm this er this year.
Now he says deep intake of breath don't have a puppy for Christmas.
Do as I do have turkey instead.
I'm playing this one because I like it.
It's a little a little fresh Cajun music from New Orleans from the  and I can say that er that's why I'm playing it really.

Er B B C radio York you are not in the South of France but as it is persistently snowing around the county at the moment I thought you know a little French flavour.
Was it the Beaujolais Nouveau wasn't it this week was it?
Everybody seems to be nodding around here I thought it was Thursday it was wasn't it?
Could anybody bring us a bottle down here  you know because that would be nice wouldn't it on a on a cool Saturday afternoon here as we sit overlooking the grand metropolis of York.
It would be nice to have just a little swig of the erm of the new grape.
Has anybody tasted it?
I haven't tasted it anybody taste give me a call.
I cos quite frankly I have never heard such an exciting R S P C A man as that last one so I don't expect to get much response to that.
"Er so let's talk about the, can't hear can he he's not up in this area?"
No he doesn't know does he?
Er stuff it.
Ah anyway so erm I don't think anybody's bothered about er fish and chips arrived have they?
Everybody's in there.
"Thing about this programme it is so it is so crucial to everything that goes on at Radio York while it is happening, they eat in the other room that's how much er interest there is they eat in the other room."
Tour buses around York.
Should they be banned?
Should we get rid of them?
Is York a big enough city to have them?
You know the open topped buses where they go round they hold up the traffic.
I know the tourists are very important to York but for goodness sake it isn't a huge city can't they walk round?
Why can't they walk round?
"I think if we got rid of all those open topped tour buses in York, traffic would be a lot easier."
What do you think?
Give me a call you know the number O nine O four six four one six four one.
You can ring now.
"Give me a figure, that you might have seen in an advert, when you're drooling over BMWs and things, Maseratis."
Miles per hour.
Telling you about its acceleration.
What does it say?
Goes from nought to sixty.
Good.
In?
Six seconds.
Six seconds.
Nought to sixty in six seconds.
So those are the units of acceleration.
"From one speed to another speed,"
In however qu
"in so, so much time."
"So let let's say, instead of quoting from nought, they said well a much more useful figure is perhaps, which they do quote in lots of these car magazines, is erm forty to sixty"
Mm.
because that's what you need for overtaking someone.
"You can go from forty to sixty in point three seconds or something, you can really shoot past anything on the road."
"So forty to sixty, miles per hour, metres per second, whatever you like, let's say metres per second."
Let's say it goes from  forty to si forty metres per second to sixty metres per second in ten seconds.
"More of a slug, this car."
So what would that acceleration be?
How w what would the units of acceleration be?
Twenty metres per second per second.
"Twenty metres per second, per second."
Per second.
It's simpler to say per second per second .
"It's  Or per second squared, or second to the minus two."
"What is this rubbish, it doesn't, doesn't, cannot possibly mean anything real."
Mm.
"Well, it is real."
It's  erm fifty miles per hour  per hour.
"Yes, well course I."
The scenery and photography and everything suppose to be absolutely wonderful.
Yes that's worth it .
.
A lot of our modern hol
Hello Max.
"Modern   Come on, no she hasn't got anything for you,."
"Come on, come on, come on."
"You know, it, it makes me smile sometimes when I say  come and try the mo modern politic approach to your ache, ache's and pains, your ailments."
.
"Most of it comes  think so, I mean so much of it comes from the North American Indians that"
Mm.
"and right back into the er, the Keltic legions and the medieval monks."
"That's right, there's certainly a ."
"That's what I said to you, your dad when he didn't want to take Aspirins for his restrained back, and him, don't believe in these drugs and I said look, if a monk gave you this he'd, he'd give you the bark of a birch tree, pound it up in a pestle and water and you'd think it was magic  and you'd take it and you, relax your muscles, is that what it is?,"
I said yes that's what Aspirin is originally  birch bark.
"Well of course they used to use the poppy, for people in great pain"
"Oh yeah,."
"amputations, child birth  gosh the leaves are thick."
"Mm, they're lovely aren't they?"
When ever I see these big leaves you know these big ones
Yes.
they remind me of when I was at school.
"Sycamore oh, sycamore and  ."
"used to get told to go out in the Autumn and we used to get told by the, used to get taken out by the teacher into some woods and you would have to collect the leaves ."
Actually I
"Could always , could always see if  biggest, biggest leaves like these you know,."
"That is a Sycamore cos it isn't a, there isn't a conker tree around here that's Sycamore, there they are, that's it, that's a Sycamore tree, beautiful colour  These are  Dances with Wolves."
"Oh, it's  in shop."
If it's
.
"If it's good, erm, can I say truthful background of the Indians ."
Also on the A one in the Leeming area the inside lane of the south bound carriageway's closed at Holby Grange for emergency gas repair works and delays are likely as a result there.
In Selby there's a demonstration taking place this afternoon it starts at half past one and will go via Barlby Road and Scott Road and some traffic delay delays are likely as a result.
Also in York today traffic near to the Knavesmire could be slow due to an event taking place there.
In the Ripon area weekend roadworks mean the  Road will be closed as it passes under the A one bridge delays are likely as a result.
At Stockton on Forest Stockton main bridge over the A sixty four is closed for resurfacing work through to six o'clock on Monday morning.
And finally in the Thirsk area there are no further reports of snow on the high ground there but some moorland routes may still be a little slippery.

Oh that was slick.
Okay now er Garth Brookes my favourite country singer at the moment and er your chance to win this Elvis video okay you have to ring in we're giving this away first you have to ring in and tell me and tell me the next word no I can't do that I can't no I can't do it's too easy okay.
All right tell me er complete the sentence of this of this particular hit song that Elvis er had and it's difficult all right.
There were three words in the don't ring yet there were three words in the title I'll give you two you have got to give me the last one.
It is difficult it is difficult I know all right?
O nine O four six four one six four one this is it.
I didn't have to say anything.
"I said to him  I don't know, he said  did you enjoy yourself Tuesday?"
"Oh I said, did you see us?"
Oh yeah we saw you.
And his dad's nice.
Yeah.
But that other bloke was there but he wasn't in his normal place.
Yes
Why wasn't he in his normal place?
Palace played really well.
"The first twenty five minutes, when you think we were one nil up right I thought gosh  if we could get that second goal it would have made all the difference and United would have been really would have been in trouble."
Was a good game though.
"Oh I enjoyed it, yeah."
"Just don't enjoy Palace losing, but   sheer football   and it just shows you that ironically the two games can match each other and there were chances for Palace to wrap that game up."
But er  when they do play that ball to ball  business erm
Yeah.
we look like we've got huge spaces in our  in our midfield.
"I mean  that's what teams are doing now, they're realizing that's where all our weakness is in midfield  so  don't take a er a hefty boot and try and er er  people like Thorn and  I mean Thorn and Young were impeccably  they played beautifully today."
"You cannot ask Thorn and Young, I've never seen two players play  they do, they did th , they do the simple thing  but they do it consistently well."
"Over and over again, maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty times in one match and they'll make one mistake and usually like Coleman was there to c , I think Coleman backed up well and Gareth  backed up well once or twice."
But defence wise  superb.
"Absolutely su , there was a lapse with that guy, don't know who was to blame about that third goal but I mean"
It was Young.
Er Young let it plop over
"Oh, didn't see who it was."
"It was like, it was like a, like they were waiting for an offside or some there were just couldn't believe, it was"
But it was the same when Palace scored and exactly the same thing happened didn't it?
Why do they lapse?
It's weird.
"Yeah, it's  well they do say both sides that it's the most dangerous time straight after a goal."
"I mean often, times you see teams equalize immediately."
"You know it's like, you sometimes you can go a whole game like seventy minutes of a game and no-one's had a goal scoring chance"
Metal Mickey.
really
Metal Mickey.
Well that's
really a bright spark.
You know.
Yeah.
What I'm
But erm
"what I suggest is these procedures are, we briefly mentioned this this morning, are supposed to reflect the best practice of what we do now."
Yeah.
That is not what we do now.
"That is actually saying to the Q S, you've now got authority to come in to B E S and effectively do what you do on the civil side."
And what I'm saying is he's certainly not geared up to undertake that task.
And that certainly hasn't
Jim?
been debated.
"On, on, in many cases"
Mm.
Go on.
"I mean if I took your line, your, your logic and maybe I'm misinterpreting it, er we would not have changed anything when B E S came into, to our organization."
"And one of the most significant changes I wanted to make, and I think we have made was that the, the letting of contracts and the vetting of contracts and so on would be done by our Q Ss, in the same way as it is for the civil work"
Indeed.
"for a very simple purpose and that is that it, it improves our internal control."
Yeah.
"It puts an in a a almost er an independent view in there, of the costs and valuation of variations and so on."
"Now I, I think perhaps you're worrying unduly, Jim in so far as, your, your men will continue to administer contracts in the way they do now."
"The they still issue the certificate to the client, which is signed off price correct."
Yes.
"For them to sign off price correct, they have got to have had a look at the measure."
Haven't they?
Well they don't.
"Cos that's what happened to Brian, you know when Brian had his Orion nicked?got stopped in"
the cars or something?
Little Sutton  cars.
"And then, it's taking him ages to get"
Has he got it now though?
Yeah.
But er the things that they were doing were just unbelievable.
Erm you know to get the chassis numbers and that.
"buying old  say a scrapped  a written off Sierra you know, picking them up cheap for about a thousand quid from the scrappy"
Yeah.
"and then getting all the  the chassis numbers and that and welding them on to these stolen cars and    Because what, you know, er Siobhan's dad had a, bought a Montego  and  I don't know how it came about but they discovered that erm it had a diff I mean it's had a Maestro engine in it and it had  this that and the other."
And er they had to repossess it and he was paying .
"And I don't know how, what's happened about it now but at the time he was still having to pay for it"
Mhm.
even though they'd taken the car.
"there was a woman there that erm  the  police do this service thing where they'll look a car over for you, if you bought a car that you know has been er  in an accident and it's been"
Yeah.
they will have a look at it over  and check it over.
"And there was a woman on it, she had a really nice Orion, a J reg."
"Anyway when they  had a good look at it the front half was an Escort  and the back half was an Orion, half a stolen car."
You know they hadn't even matched the same bloody  type of car.
There's not really a lot of difference though is there between
There is
"Well there isn't and I I said to Mike what did it look like, you know?"
He said it was nice.
But when they're doing these welding jobs they haven't got them on those things so  as they're doing it like it's all moving and
Yeah.
Yeah they're totally
it was just a complete bodge.
I if you're driving along you can throw out the balance of the car.
Yeah.
"Well it was that erm one in Manchester, that crash  you know there was three people killed in the middle of Manchester wasn't there?"
"You know, where's our right to life come from?"
I think you can far too sentimental about it!
"Erm  humans are more important than animals, you you cannot gi equate an animal life with human life."
We are the intelligent order.
"Being intelligent, we hope we won't be cruel to animals, but you can't say that we are, animals are just as important as humans."
Mhm.
"Wha , why do you think we are more intelligent than animals?"
"Well, for a start"
"You know , because we can have television"
we could
studios?
No!
"We can reason with each other, animals don't reason with"
But
other.
"We have conversations, animals don't have conversations!"
"We are, we are living in a world , we are living in a world where constantly there's violence, does that happen in the animal world!"
Yes of course it does!
Of course it does!
Of course it does!
To the same extent?
They're horrible!
Animals are terribly cruel to each other!
N no well
Yes?
I can't accept that!
"Surely if intelligence is the answer, you know, what about mentally handicapped children?"
"They're, they're not intelligent, does that mean they're just the same as animals?"
"If intelligence is the criteria, then an awful lot of us in this room would be used as test animals!"
Mhm.
We have a choice if we want to be involved in research
Mhm.
Very good.
"We got our free milk, of course, we got our free milk."
"That was one  we got our free milk  as many pints of milk as we required for to keep our fam but no more, no more than that, just  much your family had they'd allow you a pint per  per person."
Was it erm was it hard work in the in the creamery?
Oh no.
No not in comparison to the jobs I'd already been in.
Oh no this was much easier for me.
Because   at that time .
And er after this did you move back to Edinburgh?
"I moved back to Edinburgh too because er my er my family had taken a yearning for Edinburgh, they didn't like East Kilbride so I says  left."
"And also it's true today, you go where your family wants to go and that was, this was er they had a yearning for that and they were not settling down so"
What did you do when you when you moved back to Edinburgh?
"Well I went into a timber yard er known as er, what was the timber yard again now?"
.
And they .
Where as I said  er working with timber.
Was that erm like sawmill or something?
"Sawmills, sawmills and ."
Cabinet makers
Was that a dangerous job?
"Well it could be dangerous, if you didn't watch what you were doing."
"Like every other, other job you've got to er gain experience as you go along, you've got to experience."
"And you've always got to, you've always g advice and on how to handle it before you, you put  actually handling them."
Were there erm any accidents or anything?
"Er but if there was any accidents through negligence, if there were accidents, it was negligence er and the people by themselves."
"Which is er worker often, often  often most of our accidents is caused by negligence."
So what were the conditions in the er in the mill like?
"Very good, very good conditions."
"Very good conditions indeed, aye."
Was there a union there as well?
Er there w wasn't a union then.
Mm.
"Yes, it says"
It says if you've got wheelchairs in you reduce your number of people.
You're no you're not reducing the size of the bus
well I think that's crazy
"And someone who's been u just used to driving a car, are they going to be able to drive a huge long bus with no extra tuition?"
Well
"Whether it's got sixteen people in it or twenty nine, it doesn't alter the length of the bus"
"Well, I drive the mini bus at the hospital"
I know
Which only takes four wheelchairs and of course there's the drivers of the minibus thing at .
I think I I would query that anyway
Would you like to get into a vehicle the length of a bus with no extra tuition
"No, no but"
and just drive it
"But but I query as well whether, just because you reduce the number of passengers in it, that you don't need a P S V licence or the equivalent, it isn't a P S V licence but it's it's"
have looked into that
"It sounds doubtful to me, but anyway, there's the insurance point of view, but anyway  if people whoa re willing to drive can have experience in driving before they take passengers out."
Y'know I didn't drive the minibus until I'd driven it without passengers.
Y'know I I drove the minibus with only somebody in with me before I drove it with people in it
Did you drive
"Oh yes, I drove that, but that was a long time ago that"
"Yeah, but, you drove that one"
I drove it to Ashington and back
You drove  to Ashington in it.
Erm do you think I could throw these roses out?
"They're dead, aren't they?"
I'm afraid so
It's a shame
Pardon?
"They'll they'll have been forced from last Sunday, that was the  wasn't it?"
"I know, I know but they were dead by about Tuesday."
The yellow one was dead by Tuesday.
"It's not how many stocks and shares they've got, it's not what the size of their balance is, how much they've got on deposit account, how much credit, how credit worthy they are, that is not the richness of a man or a woman."
"Here the wise man says, the blessing of God, it makes a person rich  and it does not bring sorrow with it."
It's a strange verse.
Put it to the back of your mind a moment please.
"As I turn in to the book of Genesis I read there of God coming to Abraham, and saying to Abraham,that Abraham in your family all the nations of the world are gonna be blessed !"
How is that blessing gonna come?
It comes through the Messiah.
"It blessed the  for Abraham, the Messiah."
Jesus.
Because we become  middle class?
Because we've become better off?
Of course not!
We are blessed in him because he gave his life for us.
That is the source of God's blessing.
"Not in getting, but rather in giving."
"The apostle Paul when he's writing to the Corinthians in his first letter to them, one Corinthians  ."
Well what is this?
What's the definition?
"I suppose if I come around and ask each one of us this morning, can you give a definition?"
"I'm writing a dictionary and I'm stuck on a word, I want the definition of blessing."
"And I suppose for every person here, there would be a  I would say a similar, but a different er definition."
"There'd be a lot of similarity to it, and I think if we're honest  a lot of it would come back to things."
Well let's see what God himself has to say cos he gives us a definition of blessing.
Gives it to us in psalm a hundred and thirty three  and it's in the last verse.
He is talking about God people being in unity.
"And he says, as a result of them being in unity, dwelling together in unity, he says it is there that the Lord commanded the blessing."
Whatever that is!
And it gives the blessing for what it is.
Life forever.
That is God's blessing!
That is God's blessing to you.
That is God's blessing on me.
"Erm, we're looking at all other things being equal."
"Let's assume that all the offspring are the same, in quality."
"Even, let's even make them all the age."
"Let's say they're all the same in quality, they're all the same in age."
There's still a difference as far as the parents are concerned.
Can anybody see what it is?
"Well, alright, I mean."
Let's deal with the first bit first.
Why should they treat them all equally?
"Why, why does the parent regard its offspring equally?"
In what sense?
Why?
This is the important one.
"From the parents' point of view, it is equally related to all its offspring."
"Now this is, this is the counter-intuitive bit."
Supposing I'm a parent.
"In fact,let let's do this in terms of a little diagram."
Let's put this on the board.
I'll do this in the lecture.
But let's just do it.
"It's easier if you do it on the board, and you can see it."
"Let's, supposing that I am the parent."
Okay.
I'm the parent P.
"Here am I, parent P, okay."
"I have two offspring, A and B which are smaller, little er A and B  offspring A and offspring B, and they are exactly equal in eve every point of view, size, quality and animal  okay."
"Now, erm, supposing that er, I have ten units of parental investment, and I invest ten in A and ten in B because I'm equally related to both of them."
Okay.
"Now, supposing that I want A to do something for B, like in  's case,A to give up a food item for B. Okay."
"Now as far as I'm concerned, if the benefit to B is greater, supposing for example, they're not the same age, sorry, I shouldn't have said that about being the same age."
"Er, supposing they're not the same age."
"But supposing I invested equal amounts of parental investment in both and supposing that if offspring A gives two units of parental investment to offspring B, the benefit to B's reproductive success will be three minutes, which it could be, if B was younger."
Yeah.
"Right,."
Okey-doke.
Hmm.
"It's, it's a bit cracked ."
It makes it very
"As I say it's better than, it's a bit better than it was."
But it's still not that
No.
good is it?
No.
No.
"Right, what we need to do is to hit it fairly hard and try to get it damped down as quickly as we possibly can."
Now don't get rid of the Betnovate have you still got some left?
Mm.
Okay.
Because as soon as it starts to die down you could probably go back on to Betnovate to keep it maintained.
And you may actually have to use Betnovate on a preventative basis every now and again.
"Even if there's not a deal there, as soon as it starts  it's slightly flaky  straight in."
But what I'm gonna do is give you erm Dermavate Dermavate is actually more potent than Betnovate in the ointment form again to get the rapid penetration.
"And once again, like Betnovate it's used twice a day."
And in a similar fashion you should use the Dipabase to keep the skin as soft and moist as you can
Mhm.
rather than letting it get dried out and cracked.
"Dermavate is, as I say, it's more potent, it's probably not so suitable for keeping going with, but for jumping on top of things in a hurry, it's fine."
And I think that's what we ought to use.
"Sometimes you actually need to use it under something, but it's difficult to use under things and part of the hand."
I don't know what you mean under
"Well sort of under a dressing, or"
Oh right.
"under a bit of polythene, so it, it actually gets absorbed even quicker."
Mm.
What  ?
"And straight away we say, well this procedure, doesn't work."
Yeah.
But it's
Right.
Yeah.
"come out, it's come out early."
Damn it all.
"We had a procedure erm about senior project engineers, er about two years before we"
We've gotta keep repeating that.
Er
does it?
put that into the bridge office in
Mhm.
intended .
Right.
"The thing with this , the thing that puzzles me a bit er"
Just because you booked that
"on this, and I'll reiterate this, is the process that we go through as I understand it for introducing procedures, is that we take a diagonal slice through the organization  er in other words there's a draft procedure produced."
That is sent round to people who will have been involved.
"They have the opportunity to input, it is amended er taking account of, of the comments"
Taking account of some of the comments.
It can never take account of all the comments.
Of course it can't.
It will always be compromise.
But by a very virtue of the draft going round and being commented on people are aware then
We don't see
.
Mm.
all the drafts
No.
Wh what wh where
Mr
Yes.
"Obviously there are a number of detailed points and these are just the ones that are coming off the top of this meeting and you will have more when you take them home and, and read them."
"Most of the schemes that are put in here are actually assessed by the area highway engineer and if you've got particular schemes, especially ones that you know you've talked about in the past, the best way of dealing with them is to speak to him directly and say, why isn't it in this time?"
If you're not happy with the answer then I'd be pleased to hear about it and er and er obviously we can assess the priority .
"Erm, on  there's a specific question I'd like to ask er  if he could throw some light on that one."
"Yes, if I can mention that the  is on the  and it's really associated with the government's intention to raise the er limit of lorries to forty tons by nineteen ninety nine."
Now what we have done is looked at s these causeway relief arches which  pass the water from one side of the  to the other at .
We've looked at those and the v they have very seriously deteriorated.
"The concrete's spalling, the reinforcement is being attacked and we've looked at various ways in which they can be repaired or replaced."
"To replace them, for example, would cost something over a million pounds, but this is actually a repair to those er culverts  the ."
"Right, thank you Mr ."
"Right, can I take you to the recommendation on page nine that the programme be circulated to all members of the committee."
Erm
Quickly then
I  would be the case
No er
He's got a beard.
Oh dear
Ken
On erm
Ken  yeah that's it.
Bruce?
"Bruce, yeah."
That's it.
Yeah.
I like him.
Oh I used to listen to that for ages.
Mm.
I like him I do.
"He, he has some lovely records."
"Good, good choice, you know?"
My brother-in-law said he read in the paper that erm  over a year sort of  the amount of oil tipped on our land and down drains which shouldn't be there is almost like equivalent to the disaster at Exxon Valdez.
I heard that.
"Th erm  the amount of oil that people just tip on the ground, or down the drains or whatever"
Mm.
over a year is equivalent to the disaster of the Exxon Valdez.
So really people ought to be trained to take their engine oil out
"There's this, there's this er out of sight out of mind principal"
You are fined you are heavily fined in Germany and for  decades already.
"You were not allowed to wash your car on a normal street  because oil would automatically be flushed into into the guttering, into the"
They must be going absolutely mad about East Germany mustn't they?
Well it's just so incredible that this oil has never been  I mean nobody focused on it did they?
No.
People just don't think.
They just tip it oh tip it down the drain.
Same with petrol stations I mean  the way they  spill the petrol.
I know!
There used to be safety catch mechanism
Yeah.
but there isn't now is there it just comes splashing out.
Well really I mean with quite a few you really have to watch out which is
they had a row at erm petrol station when that happened to her.
And they said it was our car.
"and, and it went, cos it was quite a bit more worth petrol that went all over the place."
And she refused to pay.
And they  me up about it.
"I, I sort of denied all knowledge ."
I didn't know it had happened!
I think they were being most unreasonable.
We at the time the attendant said it was alright.
She didn't have to pay for it.
it could easily  I mean  will be shorter I think.
Sorry?
The same building.
If you look at the look at that building.
It's the same building.
"The gates, they only had a single er they didn't have gates on either side here, they just got the one set of gates."
Erm plus this er er for for passengers.
But there wasn't there wasn't another set this side.
Wasn't room.
In fact it's a very narrow er er roadway there.
It still is.
Little er signal box at .
I managed to go in and have a chat with the signalman.
"Erm pretty little thing, the  er boxes are very standard er in design, they're they were varying in size, but erm the er sort of double hipped roof, the finials erm the angled corners, of the windows erm the er er the rails erm and the er sort of platform there, er very very standard er all over the place."
"They've got quite a few of these at erm at , at the  Railway Trust, they've er they've got a number of these signal boxes."
"They reckon they've probably got more than B R now, there."
Er but a pretty little box that is.
That's another view of the of the same box.
"Now a little bit further up the line, whoops, is junction."
"Now used to be er a link line between erm this er track here, and round the back, erm under  Road, there's still a bridge there, er and joined up near where the rubbish tip is."
"Erm and er so trains could er instead of going towards Lincoln having to perhaps back up to, they would go round er a triangle basically, and be facing towards , equally if they're coming back, they didn't have to go towards Lincoln, and then back, they could erm could erm go round and er take their wares to  sidings and marshalling yards."
"Er inside, er is a wheel which with which the erm signal box, or signalman, er could er open and shut the gates as necessary."
"And er a line of levers for points, for signals, and some spares inside."
"And that was er duly inside, you've got a fair number of spares on that."
"The reds where the home signals, yellow, the distance, and I this the black were points were they not."
"That's looking up er towards er Nottingham,."
". Long time ago,."
"An old, a very old photograph and a bit grainy."
But erm a train just coming in er from Lincoln to Nottingham.
. That's gone now.
"The signal box and the gates have gone, taken now probably five or six years or so ago."
"Again typical er  box, erm rather attractive, has now got the er normal lifting barriers."
There you can see the er  box.
"Erm and er the er  whatd'youcallit, the the er er the level crossing er and house."
Lets.
Stack them high and sell them cheap.
Erm oh we'll they're going to go for twenty P plus cost of the stamped addressed return envelope
Yeah.
friend.
Which is slightly more  than some people   do with their money.
Erm  where are we.
Oh yes orders to receive letter box stickers.
"Erm  Lisa is that  I'm not quite sure, from the York University student rooms, is  in to help us with the big box pile up."
And having spoken to her on Saturday when she came along to the energy conservation stall I intend to invite her if it's alright with the meeting to our next meeting which is on the ninth of February to discuss how the Greens can help how the University Greens can help us with that demonstration.
And perhaps forge a link you never know.
So if that's that's approved I'll give that a tick and so we can bring it up again later.
Great.
Erm I've also received information on conference accommodation and on the billboards but I've billed those as separate items so that you don't listen to me half off all evening.
That's it.
Okay.
Do we have a treasurer's report in absent here?
No he's absent.
He's .
But I do have something from the membership secretary.
Right so that's other officers.
membership secretary.
"Well the membership secretary, if I can remember how to spell it, erm mm has indeed been in touch with erm John  who very kindly sent us a free copy of erm their version of our membership list."
Which is how we found out that one that we have a new member erm Sally  who I'll add on to my list and er send a newsletter to.
Also Joan  Ian  and Mrs Green  erm we all thought they joined locally and the national party have no record.
It's the same old story.
Erm John  has suggested that we send their membership on and then that's definitely it.
We're now all up to date and we agree with head office and we can take it from here.
Erm one minor alteration on that point.
I've got a membership card for  possibly er previous
From January.
sort of yeah from the end of January's er
"So they went up there and did that, and then, I ca they've done quite a lot and then they're going up London tomorrow, I think."
So I don't see much of her.
So you think they'll probably stay up there next weekend?
Don't know.
"I'll see, I might, might go out tomorrow instead of Sunday."
"I don't know yet, I don't know ."
"What's happening about your car, is Craig going to take it back with him?"
"Well, I suppose he might as well, I mean, if you're off work, he might as well have it, mightn't he?"
"Yeah, that's true."
Mm.
"Unless I feel like being really vindictive,"
"saying, I want the car."
No.
I don't need it.
"I could have done with it, I couldn't get on the bloo they got this internal bus service that runs from each college, cos you have to go to the other colleges for your lectures, and I just sort, there's not enough, and you, you get turned away, and I just thought, I went for that bus Tuesday morning, I was supposed to get it at eight fifteen, and he just said sorry,no more room ."
"Oh no, so what happens then?"
"So, security guard came over, and if you go up to the next stop,bus, you could come in with them."
"So we got on that bus, and he didn't like it, this bus driver,oh, you're not supposed to be on here"
"What, because you hadn't parked your cars there first?"
"Yeah, but the thing is, we're not from  college, so that means their students are gonna be, like, pushed out."
Yeah.
"So anyway, we got on, and he"
"Well, that's their problem, they should get more bloody buses."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, the thing was, because it left about fifteen minutes later, at a quarter past eight, there was so much difference in traffic,"
Mm.
"half eight, getting on quarter to nine, it was jam-packed and I didn't get into the college."
It's a ten minute bus ride.
I didn't get into that college until gone half nine.
"Oh, really?"
To my lecture.
"Yeah, I didn't walk in till half nine."
The lecture starts at nine.
We didn't come into it
"Well, I mean we just said well that's, you know, an expensive place for a holiday by the sound of it, but erm we hadn't got into any details."
Well this was erm Bulgaria
"Yes, yes"
Mm
"but er so I, I don't know if he'd be interested in."
I certainly wouldn't coach it  so  I think you would be creased by the time you got there in two days.
Yeah but of course if you were being serious you'd have to ask him directly wouldn't you?
"Oh yes, yeah, well I, I, I think we'd have to  to begin with to er get something a bit more concrete, you know, about time, time"
Yeah
"cost and what not, and then you know when we've decided I mean  I'm not particularly bothered whether"
"comes along or not, but I just thought it might be nice to to give him a break away from home and he won't go on his"
"Well I mean you're only doing it for him really aren't you, that's the idea was to help him"
"Well this is it, he won't go on his own will he?"
"But the only other thing perhaps he'll go with one of the kids, that's a possibility"
"Yeah possibly but I don't think they, do, they don't, I mean they, they lived in Germany for a while haven't they, so, I don't think, oh no, didn't they go to Cyprus one year Pete and Colin or am I dreaming?"
Italy
Did they?
Yes Florentine
or near Venice
That was when he was posted in Germany wasn't it they went from there
Yes
"that's right, yeah, but whether they I suppose to be in a position to"
What they got
"afford a holiday now, I mean now they've taken on a mortgage"
Yes that's a point
"so, you know"
"that's a point, yeah"
so unless erm
even if we
tell us we
went away for the weekend we could ask him along couldn't we?
"What I'm looking for, this is part of"
I know
Sorry.
this is part of the
the spirit.
"The reason this came about Dennis, is because some people were, were playing ducks and drakes."
"And the spirit of the exercise is that we will work as a team, and the most cost-effective procedure will exist."
"And in m in many cases the most cost-effective procedure will be for the lad on site, the R E or the assistant R E to measure, and provide the measure to the Q Ss who will put that forward and process that in the way they do now and send out a certificate."
And I don't see anything contentious about that.
Can I take it that if
"I don't, I don't like how it is worded then, because I don't think you said that."
Sorry to
No.
"It, it was worded that way because there are"
It says  the project Q S is responsible for agreeing all site measurements .
That's what it says.
Yes.
He is responsible for that.
He is.
And he may delegate that
He may delegate to
I agree with you  but
and in many cases will delegate that.
He is also responsible for the valuation
He has raised it with the contractor.
It doesn't say that here.
It does.
But there's no .
The letter of delegation normally says that
"It says, normally it says, normally obtaining them personally"
The letter of delegation has always said that Q S will measure
Yeah.
"Shall we have just a quick Lisa and Dean want to tell us what's going, cos they've had you, had the first meeting now, haven't you?"
Do you want to tell us what interest there was.
"I, I was about to ask the same thing, yeah ."
"Are you going to,interest  ."
"Well I called a meeting but I didn't think I advertised it well enough because there was a lot of interest and then I think we held it at the wrong time as well didn't we,"
Mm.
"we held it after prep, so we've organised another one for tomorrow lunch time and erm  and lot more people express interest because of that, we haven't actually got any letters yet."
"No, that's  so when we leave there should be more interest."
"Mm, mm, good, good."
"And I'm intending to, to hold a few more assemblies as well to sort of get interest going again because it's been a while since we did an assembly on it, so if we do another one, that usually gets it going again doesn't it?"
"What you run assembly's with on, particular topic then."
"Yeah , well we'll take erm Michael  gave us say erm a, an assembly sheet didn't he and we just read from that, and that got a lot of interest from that."
Yeah
"Mm, good"
How many teams were suppose to meet  out of that?
It was about twelve people.
How many is that?
.
There were a lot more people than that.
That was last week.
"I was gonna say, there were a lot more people when we went to school."
"There are a lot more people than that, there, I only put one advert ."
"Well that's, that's, lot more people who are interested ."
Right.
"Even so, that tell us ."
"Ah right, well yeah, I suppose"
Advertise in Stortford
Twelve is a working number.
"Oh well I hope, I hope it goes right tomorrow."
Yes.
"Yes, good, good, just keep in touch with us and know how things are going."
Yeah.
comprehensive list.
New recruits ask them  what a good idea.
"Charts of  asking questions, if people come to you and ask questions keep referring the same things  similar things to you all the time."
Perhaps it's cos they don't know the basics.
What sort of errors do they make?
Persistently make errors and the same  with it.
"Complaints from other departments and complaints from members of the public, changes in job spec er new technology perhaps er   backlogs that, people always have a backlog don't they?"
"Is it cos they're lazy, often think it's cos they're lazy don't they?"
I think it's often because people are always  and then it always gets put to the bottom of the pile.
Things they're not so sure about .
"Perhaps might not be it, can't, you can't wave a magic wand and say everything's  but they might not."
Body language can suggest you have  like jumping out a window or hanging themselves or whatever.
"Promotion, succession planning."
"We do enough succession planning in C U  you know it's magic you know, you know number two like it's smashing number two it's still you know, you know young children, number two has a different connotation to what it does here, but definitely if you are a number two here, it means the same to what a child thinks it is, but I"
"er, and appraisals."
All  all packets that we can use to identify  I really do need people to talk to me.
"Alright, so that's a brief out overview if you like of some of the errors that we can do."
Let's go a bit more specific  Job analysis.
We do the first bit who needs to be trained  what do they need to know is the second
"Yeah, so what they need to know and why  forms a heading Job Analysis."
Where do you get your job analysis from?
Personnel.
What?
Personnel.
Personnel.
"Okay, has anyone seen their job spec?"
Does it actually give you any training  on it?
It's very broad isn't it  yeah.
Erm
Oh no it's the same sort of thing you're told it when you
You're told it aren't you?
It tends to be blocked up in somebody's mind what you do.
I'm the Chief Superintendent that covers the the north east of England yes.
OK.
So you're the big boss are you?
One of them.
One of them.
Have you er polished your brass today got it all ready to talk to me I hope you have.
Now  sorry Alan I've got to turn you up a bit you don't mind do you?
No not at all.
It won't hurt there we are that's nice OK.
"Now Alan, first of all er have we learned anything do you think over the years or do we seem to be getting worse?"
Sadly the things seem to be getting worse.
Er we the Society try our very best to get over the message to people just before Christmas.
Please don't give a pet for Christmas.
But unfortunately er it seems to fall on many deaf ears and we the Society as other many charities who deal with animals are left to pick up the pieces.
"Why is it it seems to me also, and I may be totally wrong here, but it seems people who are least likely to look after themselves are the ones who want to have animals?"
"I mean you see them walking around particularly people who go for the big dogs, you see them walking around with a big thick necks, the tattoos, the er the boots and the jeans rolled up."
Well I think that's a little bit to do with a bit of macho image.
Erm and er perhaps it's the owners wanting to look rather big.
Unfortunately they don't think before they get the pet that you've got to look after it.
It takes
But an an
time it takes money.
Another thing is of course it's all pets it isn't just dogs and cats.
That's right yes.
I mean people have er er budgie or er er er another sort of bird and they think it doesn't need any looking after.
That's right.
Er just before Christmas you see people think that buying a Christmas present er that's easy.
Once you've er got over the newness of it the the the thing can be put in away in a drawer can be put back in it's box.
But with an animal it's for life.
Er you've got to look after it.
You've got to devote a lot of time to the care and attention that it requires.
"I I heard the other day what I thought was one of the best advertisements not to have an animal for Christmas very emotive, er I think it was for the R S P C A, and I I'm told I don't think you've heard it but it b basically it's it's er the sound of a  er well it's a human pretending to be a dog really and saying you know, Well this is nice my my er family have taken me to the vet, I didn't think I was ill but never mind."
"Sir, is Miss  not in?"
No.
Could you take your coats off please and come into the blue room.
Well who's taking Miss  's class?
question?
What?
the answer.
Can you come through please.
Right folks  Donald is here making typical  of English in use  from schools at the moment.
So if you would er ignore the presence of the microphone that would be helpful.
I intend to give you a demonstration today based on work that  Kevin has done.
He's  his plate with hard wax as many of you now have done.
"He has  varnished the back with, can you remember what sort of special old varnish it was?"
Straw hat.
Correct.
Well done.
Straw hat varnish.
Now it's safe from acid attack on the back and on the front except for where he has lightly drawn through the thin wax coating using the etching .
Drawn this little character and what I intend to do is put this into acid  and etch it.
The actual etching process where the acid bites through the liner into the metal and makes a rule.
When that's happened I'll take it out of the acid  clean it and show you how to take a print from the plate.
"I would like you all to try to  remember  the stages of the process because you're going to have to do, as I said to you last lesson, a small write up on this in order to get your unit of accreditation  for this work."
That is to say your special certificates .
Right erm  would you normally be  room?
Would you normally be in this room?
Is it likely that there are other pupils who may turn up in that room in a few minutes?
Or do you think that you may be the only ones?
Are they all on the English trip?
Okay.
In that case could you just take your coats off and put them somewhere  erm out of the way.
Please.
"all they're doing is erm, where people do it on a Saturday they, they won't do their, go football or something and then go on a Sunday, now I think it's nice to have a, a day when nothing happens."
"Yes, when it's all quite all the shops are closed ."
.
"Apart from religion or anything else, you know."
"Yeah,."
Yeah.
"It, I think it's nicer when, when it"
"Oh yes, not necessarily religious grounds I agree with you, it's just nice to have one day a week where everything is peaceful."
"That's right, yeah, where as it's now they're all going to open up, gonna go chasing around"
"Just be like a Saturday ,."
"we shan't know which day, there'll be no weekend, will we really"
No.
it won't be a weekend.
No
"And that it's all for money and they're doing alright, I mean they're already making so many you know, millions they're making aren't they?"
"Well the big ones are, yeah."
Yes.
Oh yes.
"There's only one thing, it might mean more part time jobs for college leavers and things if they go to work on a Sunday in the big stores and they did, give them a foot up to start a job, then get taken on you know as  ."
"But the one's that's gonna be hit I think are, people like old Lionel."
Yes.
Mm.
"Because he, he's not doing all that good you see, and when er, he, he re he reckons on Sunday"
Yeah Sunday morning .
.
"But I prefer Lionel, I'll go round the supermarket's but I'll shop at Lionel's on the way back."
"We do, we don't buy ."
"Cos I can pick out his stuff or say I don't like the look of that one and he'll, he'll chuck it in the back."
"Mm, mm."
"And he'll often say to me look there's a fresh box under there, help yourself to what you want, i haven't opened that box."
"And, and if you complained about anything, er like we found, perhaps had a banana that's not been quite ripe, he'll give you two or three the next time you go in if you say anything about it"
"Oh yes indeed, indeed , well only last week I said do need some flowers, come on Thursday they're fresh, I said I want them now Lionel, I hate to be without flowers in the room and he said well have two for the price of one, he would insist that I had two bunches for the price of one."
Right.
Because I've already written to Atkins cos that's in the newsletter.
Yeah.
So he's Secretary of State.
I'm asking the people round the table to write these extra couple of letters because we must be activists because we're here by definition.
And so we're likely to I think if I put the whole list in the newsletter it might have put people off.
Yeah.
Erm
Yes is it  all about this any more in the newsletter next newsletter?
No because I think by the end well unless something dramatic happens on the fourth of February which is this Friday next Friday rather.
If it does I'll be on to you straight on the phone.
But otherwise I I don't expect to need any more work on this for this Friday.
Yeah.
But we ought to have something about having a second reading in it anyway
Oh of course yes.
because it's news.
Yes indeed.
Even if it's stop press.
probably getting tight for Monday the seventh anyway.
Brilliant.
On a point of information Helen what can happen on on this second reading if
Right I can I I can tell you.
Erm there'll be a whole a whole day's debate on the bill which is an achievement in itself.
At the end of which a number of things can happen.
Firstly the bill can go through on the nod with no note.
This is possible with ballot laws  is now ballot bill.
But we can't rely on it.
It's quite possible that some MPs will try and talk the bill out.
That is try and ensure that when the House rises at two thirty P M the debate on the bill is still in progress.
And if that happened the bill automatically falls unless we can move the closure of the debate.
"Now this means that the sponsor of the bill, Allan ,brothers,pro proposes that the debate be closed and the bill be given a second reading."
In this case we must not only win the vote but we must have a hundred MPs in the House to vote for the closure.
"the main point that I made to him was that after such a superb beginning where, where they actually state how much rubbish we produce, there's absolutely no mention  even though there's space at the bottom  there's no mention of recycling at all."
"And he said well it's a different, you know different department."
Mm.
I know yes
"And this was, this, that, that wouldn't have entered into  that brief but my argument was that, you know everybody would be much happier if there was less rubbish to put in the landfill sites  in the first place."
"Now that was about two weeks ago and I've been sitting on it meaning to, to write to the press and say how disgusting it was."
Which I have just done today.
"Aft , no"
"Yes, half way through I spoke to to the environ environment officer"
Mm
who was much more  switched on.
"He's a new environment officer, he's only been there for a month or something."
And he says that  erm.
He sort of agreed with me that it was a waste of an opportunity.
Erm but he did say that he's actually writing a leaflet which they can run to seven or eight pages.
A detailed one about recycling.
anybody will read so  eight pages.
Well I don't know.
I just don't know.
But I mean he was very interested and when I said that we'd actually done a recycling directory and that I was thinking
redoing it.
Erm.
He was very interested and he would like to meet us and I said that if he's actually doing a directory
all this all this about.
I thought Rob is doing a sort of recycling what do you call it composium
Rob has just done a green audit for the district council.
Yes.
Yes.
But we haven't had the opportunity to read it.
I mean he knows that we have a recycling d .
I was in touch with them.
I sent them the recycling.
You can ring about anything you want actually.
Anything you feel like you can ring I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm really you know.
Shame of the Killer oh no I don't think we'll do that er  look through the Sun see if there's anything interesting erm  in there  I've got nothing in the Ewbank .
Boxer Chris Ewbank worth around eight million is moaning that he's got no money.
What has he done with his money?
What has got he didn't give me any.
Oh he's bought a big house has he?
OK.
"Usual sort of sex, drugs, rock and roll as you get in the papers on a Saturday as well."
Or is he the best dress man too?
Chris Ewbank is the best dressed man.
That'll upset Jonathan Ross he always thought he was.
Er O nine O four six four one six four one.
Anybody who can hum by the way the er theme to the television programme Ivanhoe and I would be interested to hear from you as well.
Now as the United Nations doesn't have enough on its plate dealing with the problems on earth and obviously they're er they're there at the forefront of everything that happens  .
Action is being demanded to track down possible visitors from outer space and this is serious.
A small group demonstrators have staged a protest outside the U N Headquarters in New York calling for an end to what they say is a cover up over the existence of U F Os.
"One of the organizers, Michael Luckman, says President Clinton is scared to acknowledge that superior beings do exist."
The United States er government is afraid as are other governments to admit er to their people that there is a higher form of life.
Obviously if the U F Os touch down that would mean they would be charge and not Bill Clinton at the White House.
Okay well er I I figure that there must be quite a number of er extraterrestrials  around  around North Yorkshire and I thought it would be quite nice actually if er if there are any extraterrestrials listening at the moment they could ring in and we could have a chat.
So if erm if if you  yeah yes E T E T phoned when what do you want?
I'm not even speaking to you because of that flipping letter.
"I mean I just noticed it I read, sorry Karen walked into the studio totally uninvited through a red light."
That's a  particular no no I mean you know for goodness sake can't we av can't we actually ob observe studio discipline?
What you doing?
Just shutting that up a bit.
That's my knob if I want it open I'll leave it open.
Don't flatter yourself.
There we are you see.
Just smutty mind haven't you really.
Er the individual responsible for this this is your letter from the er director of er  the Officers of the Director General's broadcasting Principle Assistant Dalek to the Director General.
Well that's got the ball rolling.
Erm  and if anybody runs into anybody else and can ask them or anything if there isn't actually an army of er sort of letters coming through your door saying yes yes make me a candidate.
Just to remind everybody that we've decided that this year we weren't going to put pressure on people.
Because it just took so much of our energy last time helping people fill in forms and everything.
If people aren't comfortable enough to volunteer.
"I mean obviously if  for example didn't ring up and say I want to sign your name your name tomorrow, I'd ring her up to see whether she'd lost her  mind or something ."
Because you know she usually does.
She's actually got er terrible flu.
But I'm going round to see her next weekend.
Yeah but you know what I mean.
If it's somebody who we really expect to stand then by all means then chase them up.
But I don't want to go around looking for candidates like we did last time.
Because it's erm it just takes too much energy away.
Right.
And if we haven't got a full slate well I mean looking at that list we're doing quite well.
Yeah.
So would you be likely to speak to John  saying again wouldn't like to pressure Jean again but think John would like to
I'm sure John would.
Erm I shall ring him and ask him make sure he's
I'll try and ask  .
So have we taken a decision to target Bishopgate then?
Yeah.
It's five for the next five years.
It's quite a commitment.
So we're looking for the ideal candidate.
Yep.
This is before anybody gets any ideas at all.
And the the reasons for it is because we're it's the sort of by far the most solid concentration of our our actual members and likely supporters.
I used to live down there towards one part of that.
Yeah.
So it's all it's from that time on it's .
I'd like to get that back again if we could.
The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.
Other forms were near.
His sole had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.
"He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.’"
"The beauty of these words cannot entirely hide a sense of suggested differentness, of an essential something so far held back but pushing now to get out."
"It is this sense which seems to be given the clearest possible confirmation in those moments of the portrait of the artist, where the brooding Stephen, Stephen Daedalus , suddenly emerges from his vigilance in a lightening display of strength."
"Here, from the portrait, are two of them."
"‘It's a curious thing, do you know’ Cranley said dispassionately, ‘how your mind is supersaturated with the religion in which you say you disbelief."
Did you believe it when you were at school?
I bet you did.’
"‘I did’, Stephen answered."
‘And were you happier then?’
Cranley asked softly.
"‘Happier than you are now, for instance?’"
‘Often happy’ Stephen said ‘and often unhappy.’
‘I was someone else then.’
It's a lot of money.
most of it was fresh produce.
Really?
"They, it's not gonna last, like, they're still b buying more and more of it."
"It wasn't like all your basic items, or anything."
"Mike doesn't eat meat, so like, it's only like, slice of chicken, slice ham and stuff for Maryanne."
Most of it is fresh fruit and veg.
Really?
"There was some booze on there as well, but not much, so erm,"
"Right, a lot of money though, isn't it?"
Yeah.
Fifty pounds for two people.
Mind you if he sees .
"Did you, what did you want on this, did you want some jam, is that alright?"
Strawberry jam?
Have you got any butter
Yes but I remember right a .
So it was things that wasn't too heavy to carry but things that was always needed in a house and that you could run out of.
When we were er were living all on the road so we were expecting to be supplied by vans.
Mm.
And my word there was plenty of vans in them days.
Both getting butcher meat.
What even in the thirties?
Yes oh yes er er when we had a wee baker's van coming up from the Nedd to Lochassynt when when  Lochassynt Lodge you see.
So these people that had little private shops in them days did well because when the people came to the lodges it all the commodities were bought to as well as them.
It's not like nowadays when people has big fridges
Mm.
buy their stuff away down south and take it.
But no they would buy it there aye .
So provisions were bought fairly regularly in those days.
There wasn't the same er bulk buying that you see nowadays ?
No no there wasn't the same.
But only well we would get it buy it in bulk ourselves supplied by er Hamiltons of Glasgow
Mm.
and it would be coming on the steamer McBrayne's steamer and
Up to Lochinver?
Yes to Lochinver yes and that same steamer would be calling in Kinlochbervie and all the villages and this traveller for Hamiltons would be going round beforehand and you would be getting a hundred weight of sugar and tea it would be in a big tea box er er probably er er Ceylon coming from Ceylon but you the whole or you could buy a small quarter.
But oh yes you would buy all that stuff in bulk.
Mm.
But that stuff that was in bulk but you would never er no perishables no peri
Mm.
Can you recall in those days Tommy how people kept perishables?
Well er er there were it was big caverns that'd be underground.
If there was a big bank at the back of the house they would have a hole just dug out and er built up with flagstones
Mm.
and therefore it was when when you would go in there it was quite cool.
Mm.
Even in the Summer?
"Erm but the idea that someone is putting it all down, all those private conversations, all those tensions, and it's all being recorded, not to present the historic truth, but to present the truth as the person wants history to read it."
"That's what always happens, they're self serving, self pleading, self justifying."
Er perhaps they're helpful to the historians because they can then put them all in a room.
"Although I must say I I mean, one of the most fascinating pieces of politics I was ever involved in, was when I had to defend Mrs Thatcher over the Belgrano incident."
And people were very kind about the quality off the speech that I made that that did it.
I believed she was one hundred percent right.
I believed then and I believe now.
I must make that absolutely clear.
"But I had to get together in one room, the admirals, the intelligence people, the civil servants, all the people who'd played a critical role in advising her."
"It was only six months before, they couldn't agree."
I wonder what each of their memoirs would look like.
So what about mrs Thatcher's memoirs?
The timing.
"Well I glanced Yeah, yeah."
"You know, look, I did a deal with Mrs Thatcher in nineteen eighty six, that I wouldn't open up many of these issues, and if she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
But she hasn't.
"As far as I'm concerned, personally, so far, she has."
What was the deal then?
That I wouldn't pursue the issues of nineteen eighty six.
"And I I haven't I  with the No it's very simple, I left it to the select committees of the House of Commons."
"But we're talking about now, we're talking about Mrs Thatcher having written"
I  deal
a set of memoirs er critical of the Prime Minister while he's still in office .
Erm er I'm she hasn't been critical of me.
No but she's been critical of lots of other people.
Well we don't know for sure yet about what she's said about you.
Do we.
If
"That's what I said, If she sticks to the deal, I'll stick to the deal."
S But but y what what you're saying is that if someo Have you seen the book by the way?
Have you read the book?
Right .
Yeah.
"Yes  I mean it doesn't go down well and I'll  say the things you have to do when you when you're helping to run a club, you have to commit yourself to the club and you have to do the jobs that th presented by the club."
"I mean I date mine, er well I don't date 'em I  I sign the cards at home and do all that at home before I go"
That's right.
and then when I come here I've just got to date  what fish is on the bench.
That's right.
And it cuts down the work then.
The way he's doing this  is there's  they can go.
Well that's no use is it?
That's no use.
I know they were still judging after midnight  and that's no good really  no good at all on a working week.
When we got there we had to  species of fish  and then take it out and
Yeah  yeah.
"It's a good idea  it's a good idea in principle  but, but it's not a workable proposition when you've over a hundred fish  and there's evening"
Yes.
she hasn't got enough time
one of the  didn't come till nearly quarter past ten.
Yeah  yeah.
"I think it er, on reflection I think er I would discourage  members from having a three-way table show  I like the, the one-off  you know, one against one  because it works better"
yeah.
I think it works better.
Yeah.
"Yes of course yeah, but the, you know, we, we have to, I have to make a report and I have to recommend  so I'm recommending  that we forget about the three-way stuff."
"Er, we had a breeders' meeting in October which was  I enjoy them very much, I enjoy the  the talk because it's the first chance I get during the year when I can sit down and listen  and I don't have to worry about them generally, in another club, I don't have to worry about minutes or anything, I just sit and listen and it's great  it, I really enjoy that."
"Meetings  once again I have to say  the old, old  chestnut  please can we start at eight o' clock  er we're getting new members who  get a bit discouraged when we have a late start."
"I know it isn't easy  but erm  I think we should  you know, try and we  advertise starting at eight o'clock  and very often there's only Alan and I here at eight."
So if we could all try our best to get here at eight o' clock.
Particularly when we're trying to get juveniles into the club  I mean they want to go at ten possibly  you owe them  not starting till
Yeah  yeah.
It's very difficult to
"nine there's nothing, you know  they'll get discouraged."
"So you  John  now  Jonathan   he's only fifteen, I know he looks in his twenties, but he's only fifteen and he's done a lot of homework  so it makes him  late and it makes him uncomfortable and he's fidgety because he  knows he's got to disturb us when he goes out, he doesn't  doesn't enjoy disturbing us, so  I have to make that clear to you."
Now let's move along the line.
"Erm any any questions on er  itself or you know if there's anything I haven't told you, I mean there's probably quite a lot, well there's a lot I know there is."
But yes anything you want to er erm please jump in.
"Er but if not let's move up erm to towards er towards , and this is erm this is the erm former under-bridge at , going up to Mill."
Now the roadway used to come under the railway.
"Little humpback, bridge here, erm and used I say used to go through to  er Mill itself just er quarter of a mile along the track."
"Erm the er the road was later just moved to the left hand side of that bridge, and er no longer having to have that restriction."
But that is still in place as you can see.
"Er a fairly light railway, erm but er but adequate."
That's taken from just re wh basically where the roadway is now.
And that's the trail looking towards .
"Now let's move up to the next port of call, which is  Station."
I should say it's convenient for neither I should imagine.
Erm single track shown on this ordnance survey map.
"Again about nineteen er I think nineteen fifteen, maybe a little bit earlier."
"Erm a passing loop there, for trains to be able to just pull in and let anything going the other way, because it was mainly single track from er from  onwards."
Erm and a little bay there for er goods traffic to go into the sort of station.
"Station platform, the bridge there, and the station master's house, there."
A little head shunt at the end to protect anything running back onto the er main line.
Erm slightly nearer picture.
Er and I think erm er a bit later date actually.
No it's probably about the same.
"That one's a bit later date, and you can see that they've double the track here."
"Erm just made it a er does it's not double track er very far, but they have actually double tracked that."
And this is erm in the nineteen forties nineteen fifties.
When there was a fair amount of er goods traffic particularly coal from .
That er that line I think went to just er a bit further up and erm er I say not an any matter of er another couple of hundred yards I think before there was only a single track.
Er that is the station master's house at  Station.
And er it's now the part of the  you can er go to a picnic area along here.
You know you can walk through there back to .
You can just see the remains of the platform there.
And er platform over here.
"It's not, how I prosper financially."
"It's not, whether I'm in good health."
"It's not whether,a , whether I've all my little  itty-bitty prayers answered."
God's blessing to me  is life forever.
That's his blessing to you.
It's not making a list.
"It's not giving you  total health, and free you from all sickness and diseases."
It's not answering all your prayers.
It's not making your life easy.
It is giving you life forever!
That is the blessing!
That is his big parcel he's given to you.
It's wrapped up in a .
", thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift!"
The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
"Those disciples, they had the storm stilled for them  and it got  easier sailing."
It was plain sailing then to the other side.
"They were more comfortable, it was a, it was a more enjoyable journey, and let's be honest  if I can go through life without hassles and without problems my life will be more enjoyable, of course it and these difficulties, and these storms coming away, coming your way your life will be more enjoyable."
"But like the disciples, it will not be any better, or any safer."
Their safety did not depend on the storm being still.
Their security and safety depended on Jesus being with them.
That was it!
"Your safety, and your security and my safety and security in life  does not depend on how pleasant my ways are and how pleasant my paths are  how much I manage to amass, and how I can overcome all the little difficulties and problems and  steer clear of the big ones  the security and safety of my life, now and in eternity,security is there in the boat  and lying with him."
"See, the real peace  is not the stilling of the storm  the real peace is that the assurance of who is going to stop it."
That's the promise to your eternal life.
I will never leave you.
"You don't understand the circumstances, you don't understand the storm    I might , I might not  leave that to me he says  I will be with you."
I will never leave you.
I will never forsake you  even to the end of the .
Well let's see
Come in.
And so how can the Communist Party
But I mean
"just say right, we're gonna do this, this"
Just because they don't know what it  socialism
"theoretical concept or something, they might have known that they wanted"
Yes but it's the basic underlying concept
capitalism and becomes rich as the we western world then th they'll be all for that
"No, I just find that  really difficult  because they didn't have the means at that time to achieve it."
"I mean we've already established the fact they didn't have, they didn't have the personnel to"
.
Yes they did.
They were in power.
They were in power but I mean who's to say that the pe there's not gonna be a civil war and they'll be thrown out of power.
So why did they think that they had the er  means to do it in nineteen forty seven?
"You know when they said, when they went for a very radical policy"
Well perhaps because they were more idealist and that now they're becoming more realist but they're still  erm I mean they're learning from their past mistakes and they've seen that right so we have to have a moderate policy which is gonna take us a little bit further towards socialism.
They're not totally contradicting their ideals.
Oh yeah
It confirms our suspicions
at the last gasp we were right.
It's all this absolute power corrupts actually isn't it?
Mm.
"Erm the, the people who  did Mao ?"
Or ?
"Well I mean  there, there, there's no question about nineteen forty nine absolutely non no documents  could have come out unless they had Mao's approval."
Mm.
Er
Did he shoot the other people involved by any chance?
that's behind this
Right.
erm
I E it's the same person who comes up with
Don't tell him blue eyes
Oh dear.
"I know that's not funny, but, it is funny."
It is
"Ryan just revels in anybody who's been naughty, he think he really is spite which I think is a bit frightening in a child, really."
It is because he'll be
Yeah
Looks to  just led into
"Yeah, he is, he's very easily led, Ryan, you know, and he's very into, you know, getting on with the gang."
Which is really sad.
"But erm, he's a little shit."
"Called me, he's called me a college crappy, he goes why don't you go back, he goes, why don't you go back to college, you college crappy."
"He went, you're just a drop-out, you're just sponging off the government."
"I was like, shut up, Ryan."
"He's like, I know your sort."
fourteen.
Yeah.
"But the sad thing is, he's got he's got quite a bit of brain, ain't he, to come out, you know, little things like, although they're rude, he's obviously aware, but he's wasting it all, ain't he?"
I know.
Quite intelligent.
"It's like, what was he, he was going, oh that's right,he keeps going, I can't, but they're cold now  but he was like, at the dinner table once, right, and Ryan and Gran argue continuously, and he was going erm, and he went, Gran, and Gran went, yeah, and he went, do you know what you are, and Gran went no, and he went, well, I can't remember what it's called, he goes, they're this, I think it's a hybrid, he goes, you're a hybrid."
"He goes, do you know what one of them is, he goes, it's just sort of like evolutionary thing between the ape and man, and he goes, it's sort of part way between, and it's sort of like some sort of creature, and it's half like an ape and half like a human, and he goes, and you're one of them  he goes, you're one of them Gran, he goes, you've got a brain like one of them, as well, and Gran just like went  oh shut up Ryan."
She doesn't really know what to say.
"Oh, shut up Ryan, and then he sits there for a bit,and she goes, yeah well, you used to wear national health spectacles."
"Ha ha ha  and Ryan goes, oh shut up Gran."
"But he's like, when they think they can get any little thing they can think of to wind each other up."
It was so amusing.
"But it just go Ryan is, you know, he's a bright boy."
"Yeah, I know, it's sad ain't it?"
"But like,Mi Miss  said to me, when I went up there, she said, ah I know, she said, you hear a lot of bad stuff about Ryan, she said, but he's a nice, he's a nice little boy really, and she said, he's very polite, he's very polite, he can be very polite to you."
"She said, and a lot of the time, she said, he's a, he's a little sod, she said, but you know, she said, I mean, it's not all bad things about him, and I said, I've been hearing things about you from Miss , and she  oh, what she's been bloody saying, I bet she's been saying I'm crap at English."
Yeah well .
I didn't say what the license is.
we only insure for the intrinsic value of
And is there any situation
the item.
That's all.
Right.
But you guarantee them delivery.
Yep.
On the piece of paper.
I know but you've lost the .
We give them their money back.
"I mean, well it'll probably arrive, it'll turn up somewhere won't it really?"
But se
Could do.
"I mean send another one is what we're saying, have your money back."
If you haven't got the  you should be okay.
Or
"if it arrived, if you paid for a before"
One customer should expect it to arrive then
noon  and it er
"I mean, same ta super mail, we wouldn't give them their money back."
I think that's a bit more than that now.
"But if you ordered a ten thirty delivery and it arrived before noon, we would just give you the money difference the before twe , ten thirty and the before noon price, not the complete price."
Unless you wanted to argue about it.
"But we feel that, okay, you know, it may have been a half an hour late but you got there."
"And therefore, we have incurred cost and therefore, but okay, it wasn't the guaranteed service."
"But you could argue with us, you know."
"And again, a commercial decision is made locally based on the strength of the account."
"But we don't, you've gotta be careful as you probably know Phil, the abuse can of the ca , you know, carrier, you know, can be a nice little earner if you're not careful."
"And, you know, erm people can  intend to fail in order to claim money, revenue back, and so on."
D'ya know
"Or damaged goods can, you know, put the foot through it to get the insurance cover on what we pay and we're liable."
So potentially two nights out of the four.
Does it have an address Helen?
No it's through  erm
Right I just wondered if she gave you an address cos it you know got a super little town map here.
If I was being cynical I'd volunteer Mark's car to get people to and from the town.
If it was a long way out.
Well he said that was a possibility but I really  so.
But then again .
Erm but then it starts getting very very silly.
I mean this is basically she's she already books some flats and house a house because self-catering accommodation's in such short supply because of long lets over the winter.
Do we need to proceed on this now.
Do we need to see if we can draw up an extra .
I think one of the ideas behind the the party chipping in on this is because it would be extremely convenient for people who are popping in at the last minute for
Mm.
for a night or two to have somewhere that they know they can at least kip on the floor.
Where you know so as not to have to risk going having to go to an expensive B and B because all the cheap places have gone.
So to a certain extent the idea was to that if we had the thing worked out it would be of great benefit to the people who were popping by.
Erm whereas at this stage the four of us could probably find accommodation which wasn't that much more expensive erm but to have the actual focus for the for the local party .
Could we have  people to pay the six pound a night and erm you know  a hundred and forty four to start with and just ask people to pay the six pound a night anyway and just get as much back as we can?
Yeah yeah.
Cos six pound a night isn't bad.
It's less than we pay in Wolverhampton .
Oh it's very reasonable yes.
It would be possible I suppose with the commitment of people  for the local party to make  on the committee.
I mean I have a couple of ideas.
I was going to ask Mike  if he wants to come as an observer because he's never been to conference and erm
And when it comes
he was talking about spending a weekend with us anyway so it might be nice thing to do.
When it comes to that though there will be people from other green parties who who'll be looking for accommodation so at the last minute we can
Dick  for example.
Yeah.
We're hoping that we'll
And could British Rail be sold to British Rail?
We've learned that the government can't rely on enough support from its own back benchers to push through privatization on its own terms.
And why should Chinese ancestor worship appeal to government ministers.
John Cole returns from the seaside with answers to the questions you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask.
But first Michael Heseltine.
"He's been a force in British politics for a third of a century, but for how much longer."
We've heard nothing from him for the past four months since that heart attack in Italy.
"Though the rumours have told us a great deal, he's still far from well, he might need a heart bypass, he's gonna have to retire form politics."
"At the very least, his influence over the party and British politics is at an end."
"Well it didn't sound at all like any of that when I spoke to M Mr Heseltine, near his home, a couple of hours ago."
"I asked him first, How are you?"
I'm well.
"Er medically, as best as I understand what the doctors tell me, er I'm er fine to carry the responsibilities and strain of er the cabinet job that I had."
But you have to do it g slowly.
Take it a step at a time.
It'd be crazy to sort of do a dive in from the sort of recuperative process.
"But er er the er one of the doctors who looked inside my heart They put a local injection, telescope upside, he said I've got the arteries of a man of thirty or forty."
Don't don't quarrel with him.
Don't quarrel with him .
So what does that mean?
No need for a bypass?
Because they
No no no no I just lost the tip of an artery.
"Closed down, finish."
So there's it w it wasn't close to the heart.
And so there's n the arteries themselves are very good.
"But this tip for reasons beyond my knowledge has gone so there's nothing to be done about it and erm er the last test I had the guy who conducted it said, You've already got the heart off an average sixty year old who hasn't had a heart attack."
And that sort of is very encouraging.
So you're completely fit er
Medically yes.
Er but it takes time to recover from the er the the shock and the experience and the unnerving.
But I've come a long way and er so I'll go back next er Wednesday to the department and er er if people will bear with me and put up with it er I'll take it er fairly slowly to start with but I dare say there will come a time when er erm you won't notice much difference.
Yeah.
then she said do you know these last six months we do nothing but argue  she said we've never argued so much!
Yeah.
And she said oh I think it's only the pressure.
Well that's right.
"I said well me and Geoff argue more, I said we never used to  cos we never argued a lot did we?"
No.
Well we have done  I felt sorry cos I hadn't really  when she phoned me up over there I was up  I thought oh my God!
"Yeah,"
"Cos I'm a bit worried we gotta get things sorted out  so I rang  I said I didn't to get onto you, she said no I know how they feel  she said  her granddad always do things like that."
What?
You know break appointments  I said well that only worries
it ain't quite the same is it?
well I said I suppose Geoff couldn't get away.
Well they just wouldn't let me
"I said that that worried m that really sort of worried me  so I rung her back anyway, she's alright."
"Well, you don't wanna worry about them because at the end of the day, I mean if  if that was absolutely desperate I shall turn round and say well I'm sorry I've bloody got to and that's it!"
"You know, but I mean"
But you must go Wednesday Geoff!
Yeah  No
And she been
"it was  they was that panicking cos tomorrow morning, the ministry are coming  and"
Yeah.
they was panicking.
"We all it is ba , well I say all it is  this bloody great strip right be between the ceiling and the walls, the right length of corridor and the manager see it and he said look  that should be shiny sort of like   and it's all pitted  so he said you'll have to go up here he said and do it all with steel abrasive  said fair enough."
"So of course I, took me about half hour to find the forklift cos somebody had nicked it  by time I went got the chemicals Robin comes down, he said oh don't worry about he said do i do it tomorrow morning he said, they'll be nobody about then  can you go down the bot bottom and do the butterflies?"
"I felt well  bloody marvellous, you now,i it was that imperative it had gotta be done, you can't have time o no I'm sorry you can't!"
So you could of gone to that appointment tonight?
"Well, well no, no because it was then about, that's what I'm is, then four o'clock you see, so I mean I knew I wouldn't make it anyway  that's why I thought I'd better ring  cos the job that we finished was half past three so I thought well even if I come home  I shall be late even if I don't get changed and washed or anything."
Yeah well you can't go there not washed and changed.
No that's what I thought I was
But you got an appointment fo you could of had one for tomorrow but I thought Wednesday is a better day I thought.
"Well it's not much, I mean"
You would like to see more  on the tables
Well we have had more fish out  yeah  we have had more fish out
in the show
Pardon?
Where did we come in the show ?
Ninth
Ninth
Ninth
that wasn't too bad.
I shall put in the report must do better!
do better!
we do want more fish out.
any comment about  the s the sort of format of the table show  do we want to change them at all
"How, how did it work out on the champion of champions night with having the  the table show, the full table show that we cancelled when Danny  came  er how did it work er did it work out comfortably?"
Oh yeah
"Er I felt, I've been after Danny for nearly twelve months to come see  and not been able to get him on the night I want him  the only night he was able, was available was  I think it was one night when we had something else on  I can't remember what it was."
"Erm  I think it was an inter-club actually, oh the inter-club table show  was the only night he could manage and that was no good to us  so erm  we, we  the only way we could do it was to t bring him the night that there was a full table show  transfer the full table show to the champion of champions  judge that first  and put the winning fish into the champion of champions and I know, well it's gonna be  woof  you know  a rush and that will, oh well, never mind."
Least we knew we'd get some extra fish didn't we?
yeah it's good that they had a fairer chance of getting on to the tables
twenty minutes
"So erm I'm  you kn I don't propose to do that again because I wouldn't er  I wouldn't arrange a speaker if we had a full table show but  it's nice to know that it did work out because we were, I was forced into a corner a little bit  erm and I think it was worth it because we  as I say I've waited a long time for Danny and he was well worth  listening to, I can listen to Danny for hours because he  he just speaks  and, and tells you about his fish, I'm, I'm very  very fond of listening to Danny cos I think he gives a good talk."
"he has  he  the same problems that we've all had  you know erm  and yes he's, he's, he's very easy to listen to  despite the fact that he's a southerner."
But we'll forgive him that
"He comes from near Windsor, doesn't he, cos he said he has a mate has a fish shop in Windsor"
That's right
often go to Windsor
That's right.
We was looking at a video
"erm it's an old one  and it's called Fancy Fish  and we were sorting our videos out to list 'em   and then we'll make a list  and then we'd let you have and then if you want a video and that, you know what you got  and we were looking through this Fancy Fish  and it's erm I don't know if you remember it, it shows an open show  at Oxford"
"Oh yeah, I think so."
Yes I remember.
And they would be looking for a bed for the night and it would be in the old  hay shed that we would put them but there wouldn't be a problem.
It was in the winter time so it was full of hay but they would be very careful and we would ask them that they had no matches in case er there was no cigarettes much and that but pipes  they were pipe smokers.
Old clay pipes with black twist.
But they would soon tell that they would have their before they would go to bed and thanks er very much when getting the bed and you could er vouch for that they would never.
But the odd one yes we saw the odd one but they were very odd.
Aye they were very odd.
Y you refer to them as mile stone inspectors.
Mile stone inspectors and gentlemen of the road.
Mm.
And there's a story about the late Duke of Portland when he was travelling up to to  estate where his lodge was.
There was many's a tramp that would have taken the A nine then but this one in particular and he was very very fond of him and he would ask when he was around to that he would get over to see him.
And when that poor tramp perished out on the roadside one severe winter or spring time the Duke found out where it was and to this very day there's a little mound and a stone put on it.
That was the er Lord of Caithness I think Tommy that the stone was.
Yes yes that I'm referring to yes.
The Lord of Caithness.
I cos I can't picture another stone you know on any other roadsides and I've been on plenty that and I travel and no and I can never know of another st stone that was put up to a tramp.
Anywhere in the north as far as I know.
But that one was and I heard a year ago but I never saw it till the bus driver I went with some years ago up to John O'Groats.
Mm.
And going up to to John O'Groats and right into past Castle May where the Queen Mother has and into the church where sh where the royalty goes when they're living up in up in Castle May At er well er Johnnie Groat is buried there too.
There's many a person Johnnie Groat to my name.
From these young days that you spent in Tormore can you recall how the tramps actually looked?
Oh they they
How would you describe them?
Erm the tramps?
Well fearsome looking
wild looking as you would say it now.
But but the very opposite to what people would er er th think of them as regards people now.
And that's ordinary people.
But but they looked wild because they would have long hair beards a  and and all oh my word they were wild looking but er.
And probably it was cold weather they would have two or three coats er you know.
And jackets probably below and their little bag of stuff.
"Well, it says on the bottom of the, your copy of the charge sheet, production of driving license  you must produce it, failure to produce it will mean that it is automatically suspended  and it also means you've committed yet another offence  by not having  a driving licence here to produce Mr !"
"Well I wa I wasn't sure  whether to, whether it would go through in time for the case  and that's why I haven't"
What's stopping you?
send off for it.
I wasn't sure what the situation was .
"Unless  the prosecutor is in the fortunate position of having  a computer printout of your driving  er le , holding your licence record  the case won't be able to proceed today anyway."
"And your worship, regrettably there is no printout of the driving licence."
Well the case can't go ahead today without  your driving licence.
Sorry?
The case cannot go ahead without your driving licence.
How many weeks do you want to ?
"Your worship, I would anticipate that it normally takes at least three weeks for a printout  for the computer to be able to"
And this case is adjourned for three weeks in order that a computer printout will  can be obtained.
Does that mean I don't have to apply for another licence?
"No, but er ee i , I suggest you don't apply for the licence now."
"No, you've left it too late!"
But er  I would urge you to try to find your driving licence  because
"No, I I I don't think I'll be able to because ."
"Right, well  you know you're going to be disqualified eventually for this offence if you're convicted."
Yes.
"What, the offence  the  drink driving offence?"
Yes.
Yeah.
Do you understand?
I realise that.
"You've pleaded guilty to the charge anyhow, it's a fair cop!"
The point is that when you are disqualified you're  not just disqualified from driving you are disqualified from holding or obtaining any driving licence.
So if you've got one at home  you're committing an offence  by being in possession of it.
Do you understand?
Do you understand that?
Yeah.
Right.
No Lochassynt Lodge.
That's right
Lochassynt
that's right.
And my mother er went to help them in the lodge in the season time also.
Fr from that time can you recall any incidents which er your father may have mentioned to you even as a young boy?
Well
Or stories about the the people that were there or
Well
passers by?
ah well yes the passers by will will remember being on the road side the famous tramp.
Aha.
The gentleman of the road.
My word and me just as a little boy of eight years.
I was no fear of being frightened of them because they were part of the establishment.
And well did the gentry know that too.
You mentioned that you were perhaps more scared of er ministers.
Well yeah ministers er.
When I think of it nowadays and I see children so very going round to the various churches that when people used to say about ministers well.
When you heard there was a minister coming I was just afraid and looking to see would you see that dark black clothed individual coming.
And even that seemed a  but thinking of the old tramp and he was in a a sort of all belaggered looking way.
My word but you weren't frightened of him because you were told that he was an old man and one of the road men of the road.
And there was no fright to be taken from him.
Is it correct to to say that the tramps actually used to make a special point of coming to to see your father ?
Oh yes.
Made a special point of coming there because they knew my mother would give them a bowl of soup or what was ever on.
She was baking fresh scones hot cakes anything that was going.
And my word they enjoyed it well.
They wouldn't come in they wouldn't come into the porch even.
They would sit outside wait in that days we had a seat out in the and even if was a seat for sitting outside they would sit on their own way or on a rock.
No they just had their own way of life and you wouldn't change it and they had stories to my father.
They would tell sing where they came from and who they saw and all the way up they came.
Yes.
Can you undertake that that will apply?
Yes.
And you aware of the restrictions on drink for young people?
Yeah.
And the sort of concern about that?
Yes.
And we're going  to grant this protection order which is temporary permission to keep the premises open  and I must tell you that there will be a lot more investigation before the order is granted   that the transfer is specialist.
"And we're ordering that the other person, if possible, attends at that ."
If she's not in the district then it'll be difficult.
"And if it is possible, if she is in the district we order that she attends the transfer sessions  the outgoing licensee."
Fifty eight.
Have you got the license er  Miss ?
No it's  .
"Well, but it will not be effective until er, you have produced that license to this court."
"Erm, I assume it  that this er, if the licensee has left those premises  wi she's physically left has she there?"
Yeah.
"Er, when did she go?"
About a month ago now  .
She left the company then did
Mm.
she?
"I see, well I would of expected those premises not to be selling intoxicating liquor sir, they've obviously not had a license for a month!"
That will also be er  considered by the licensing committee at the next hearing!
"You must produce that license otherwise it's not effective er, Miss !"
"See, as licensee you have responsibilities!"
"It's all very well the company telling you as employee what to do  it's yo , you're the one who's going to be in difficulties if you don't comply with the licensing laws!"
Your whole application's not been very satisfactory Miss !
And the fact that the license is not in  puts you in in in difficulty!
We are aware now that you're operating without a license and it's up to you to get that license here as quickly as possible!
Right  .
Okay.
What's the what's the primary method of of getting contact with the audience?
Well the method
Eyes
looking at them
"Yeah using the eyes, yeah, okay."
Both to to to feel to make them feel involved and to er gauge the reaction gauge how things are going so you can er get some feedback on how you're doing.
Okay
You need to keep their interest don't you?
"Oh absolutely, yes, I mean I mean"
the effect
Sure  erm no amount of audience contact will compensate for a boring subject.
"Yeah, oh yes I erm erm I'm not saying that and that's when we come on to the the design and the content that we put in."
"Yeah, you're absolutely right  very important point yeah no amount of eye contact is going to compensate for something that that doesn't hold their interest."
Okay.
What else then what other methods do we have besides having eye contact what else might we do to involve the audience to make them feel involved?
Questions
"Yes, absolutely so questions er a very definite way of involving the audience and again it gives a measure of feedback doesn't it because if you get the right answer you know that they are with you and you know they are understanding what you have to say."
"But obviously if there's some hesitation over it then perhaps you just need to step back a stage in what you're saying and er er go over it again to for clarity, and Tony what's another way of involving the audience?"
Well you've got to get them to participate but I suppose you would do if you question them
Well yes I guess you would.
Jeff what's another way that you might make the audience feel that they're involved?
Mike
Well yes okay that's a possibility and that's something that we'll come on to tomorrow.
"But in terms of audience contact, Sarah"
Jokes
Well yeah yeah a bit of humour a bit of humour
Smile at them
Smile at them well yeah okay.
"Bob, another way of involving the audience making them feel part of it"
Ask them to relate their experiences
Yes okay but that in a way comes under questions doesn't it yes.
Ask them
"So it was pragmatic but it could also fit into their ideology in that how, that if they'd gone straight for socialism"
"Now come on, this, this is disgraceful."
There's no  this is a disgraceful
No but if they'd gone straight for
document for a communist party to base land reform on.
There's no ideology  at all.
"Absolutely, absolutely none."
I think it's only pragmatic in that  it's maintaining production levels.
Or helping production but
"So is this what, they certainly ?"
"Yeah, this is it."
This is
That's
"No, no"
No but I mean the basis of it was presumably landlord out and China was based around this
Yeah.
Well it was for the next  two years.
They didn't
"No, no."
Oh right.
"I mean this, these, these, these"
Well that's alright then.
"No, I mean we would, no"
So I mean this is just another basic erm
Yeah.
"Well in fact it, it it has in fact gone full circle because through the nineteen fifties you went through to co-ops to collectives to communes which lasted through to nineteen seventy eight, the communes were then disbanded and you're back, now, after reform which took very much system."
"But, you know, if, if, if I'd have put, when we, when we started to talk at the beginning of this term we had at the beginning a general discussion about what are we gonna put in land reform, if I'd have come along to s to you and I'd said well I think we should do this"
We'd of laughed.
Right.
"And I, I, I, I, I, I would not have endeavoured to persuade you that this was going to be  the land reform document that was, that  this is it."
It doesn't surprise me that they did it.
But this isn't this is it?
And all the estate men first of all would get everything.
And all the crofters then that was paying rent.
In those days how many people were actually involved on the estate?
Well there was a lot of people involved on the estate because they had to repair paths.
They had to keep the river streams all flowing and if there was any deluge of rain and stones they would have to keep all the pools in good order and they would
The pools?
Yes the pools.
That's the salmon pools
Mm.
you see.
And they would have barriers going out so that they could so that the gentry could go out to stand on that ladies and men.
To cross the the
Yes just yes you see
the streams .
it still on the the rivers.
But now it's made of stonework or or concrete.
Mm.
Now and that cos that's the only thing that could stand
Mhm.
to the weather.
But er that's the way.
And the and the paths repairing at the riverside and all the bushes round the lodge.
And the gardener there was always a permanent gardener but he was he had enough to do but the estate men would be sent up to clear that.
And painters and joiners they would have themselves.
All self-contained?
Yes self-contained yes.
There'd be a joiner and he'd be engaged in a
"Erm  what, what we do today is to  way go back over some of the ideas about land reform and then carry them through to the ninety fifty er Agrarian Reform Bill."
Erm   what we've been looking at is  the process of land reform.
"Tt  and we're obviously looking at a process of land reform which has, has undergone a number of changes and I think we, we've begun to see some of the influences on those changes and particularly over the, the last week or so the  this has ."
"Tt er  and i in a sense there's kind of been an upward trend in terms of progression through that, that reform but within that there have obviously been a number of  and in a sense what we've been coming to terms with is, is what has been causing those, those variations, those changes in that policy."
"As I say, I would like you to be in  fairly close proximity to where I am so that you can see what I'm doing and hear what I'm saying."
Er and I don't want you to be too close.
I will actually be working to start with in this area here.
So perhaps you could arrange yourselves in a semi-circle just round here.
"Right, my friends  we've very strange and wonderful chemicals in this erm    I do beg your pardon  when we are printing."
The one which you will have come across when we were doing lino printing was turps.
"We had to use turps didn't we, to dissolve the printing inks?"
"Can you remember that, when you did lino printing?"
Mm
But when we're doing screen printing we use very much stronger solvents  which can have a nasty effect on your skin.
You notice I have slight eczema on the palms of my hands.
"Some of us have even worse eczema, yeah?"
So it's really important that we  don't irritate our skin.
But frankly  it's not likely to irritate your skin anyway because er  you aren't industrial users of this  you would only ever touch these chemicals for a very short time so the  any possible side effects they might er have on you will be  greatly diminished by the fact that you didn't use them very much.
"If you're using them in industry, day in day out all day long, then that is the real importance of wearing protective gear."
But I'm just going to demonstrate to you just  what happens.
This lovely supple rubber here  is exactly the same supple rubber here at one time but now it's gone all hard and denatured because of the chemicals.
"So if y if the chemicals will do that over a long period of time  to rubber, think what it would do to your skin."
Does that make sense?
Mm.
These lumps have become so erm hardened by these chemicals that I can't er pick up  the  thin zinc plate from the  tub.
"I'm afraid that Mrs  has gone off with, ah Mrs   I'll be very grateful if you could bring me in a bowl."
You know the one you just took out?
You want it back?
I wonder if I could have it back please?
A a bowl.
"A a bowl, it doesn't matter which one."
"Just a plastic bowl please, washing up bowl."
Do you want anything in it?
Or just water?
Er  bring it empty and I'll .
Thank you very much.
and everything went .
"When I reached the pit bottom, there was approximately three feet of water at the pit bottom and I had my first experience of water in the mines."
Were the conditions in the mines quite dangerous in those days?
"Well in those days er there wasn't much me much er coal cutting machine, this was all hewn by hand."
"And we had the pit ponies and where we didn't have the pit ponies drawing the hutches, which we termed the small wagons carrying the coal from the coal face to the pit bottom, then er we had to do it by hand."
And if there were h a wagon or a hutch went off the road there you were with not enough height to lift it all back off the rail again and believe me that was experience in itself.
So it was quite a difficult job then?
"It was a difficult job, yes."
Mm.
What were the erm the wages and the hours like?
"Ooh, the wages."
"I started the wages and er I didn't have much more, I started I had six and eight pence per shift."
Mm.
And er what were the hours like?
"The hours, well sometimes I would do a double shift which was sixteen hours."
"Or eight hours for a full shift, sixteen hours for a double shift."
Mm.
"And in those days we required the money and er often, very often we had to do it to strengthen our wages a bit."
Do a double shift.
"Which meant you come home from your double er shift, went to your bed, had about four hours sleep and were back out for your normal shift again."
Was you erm in a union or anything at all at this time?
"Yes, the miners' union then was just  wasn't that that  was started was ."
"In fact there's, very near the start of the unions in and o er that, that the miners' union was one of the first to start up."
Do you think it gave you erm any advantages being in a union?
"Y oh yes it gave us advantage to the extent that we'd someone b behind us to fight for any, any er grievances that we had."
That was the idea of the union starting out in the first place.
Mhm.
We had to pay into a union.
"We can, on every Friday there was a union official down there in a small hut."
"We had straight from our wages straight to the union, it's payed at union right away."
So that there was nobody skipped.
What were the erm the erm relations between the w the workers and the bosses like?
"I think some of them do , yes, I know s er some of them have said how much they enjoyed it when it started off first, but er  but now it's just got that wee bit more serious."
"We're with the plays, with going to the festival of course, you can't,you must be serious when you're practising for something like that ."
"Do you feel like it's almost like doing a different thing that you're not, you know when you're actually acting in the play you're more self conscious and you're more conscious of what you're you're moving and you're speaking and whereas the likes of the panto you know you just be yourself really with a bit of fun thrown in ."
"Yeah, yes, oh yes aye the plays  the plays you've got to  think what you're doing wand if you miss your cue line you're putting your, the person next, off as well that it is more  er serious and you've got to think more I think"
Mhm.
really.
But however
"So you just kind of kept kept on singing, after the choir and that finished?"
"Aha, when the pantomime started up that was just carried on in there."
"Not that I'm a great, good or great singer it's just  I seem to have a strong voice."
Unfortunately you can always hear me above everybody else.
Oh dear.
"That's, you can"
But if er if folks spoke about you you know they would they would say you were a singer?
"Because you're seen in public and you do sing in public, there's a lot of people that sing but as you say it's sometimes just in their own homes or they used to but they would never sing in public ,they used to sing in the choir ."
"Yes, sing in public, no no."
"I've I wouldn't  I don't think I would go out if somebody said, Would you come  and sing  er at such and such a thing."
I I don't think I would go.
"But in the pantomime, well you're singing with everybody else, you're not er on your own really."
And the pantomimes a different thing altogether.
Mhm.
"And I mun that  I must have words in front of me, if I don't have words in front of me even though I know it, I I still forget it."
But er
"That's right, just nerves."
I think it's the nervousness that just knocks the words coming out of your head.
"Oh,"
It's easy to do.
Aha.
oh aye.
But er  do you quite like singing for folk that know you?
"Do you like singing in the village, where everybody knows you, or would you in some ways be less nervous do you think if you were singing like even to  folk,who just don't  so well ?"
Quite know me so well?
"We'll start down at the far end of what we call the lured mark and from there you'll have to tack all the way up to this closest one, the windward mark."
"From there it's a reach out to the far end to the wind mark, drive there and back to the beginning again."
Great.
We'll try it a few times just to put it all into practice.
Okay let's go.
That's fine .
Okay.
"Okay Howard, this should be a good test to see how much she's learnt."
Over she goes.
No she's let out the mainsheet to spill wind and now she's under control again.
"It's quite a steady tack around the windward mark, now that she's reaching she should have raised the daggerboard a little."
Now ready for the gybe.
"No I don't think she's ready quite yet, she's got a few things to sort out first and that's definitely not right, she wants to raise the daggerboard not lower it, bit of confusion there about which way to turn the tiller but she's round safely, she should be looking where she's going now instead of sorting out all the string."
"Okay now she's off really quickly on a reach but she's oversheeted, she's got too much power there, she's sheeting the sail in instead of easing it out until it flaps and then just pulling it in a little."
Should Suzanne have let the sail out like that?
"No, by letting the sheet go she lost power."
After the tack she'll have to put it all in again to accelerate away.
Now sitting out to balance the wind
That tack looked Okay.
"Yes, but she doesn't need that bundle of mainsheet in her hand."
"For this part of the course she should have the daggerboard right down,and she could be sailing in slightly shallower tacks towards us."
Whoops.
What happened there?
Well she let the boat heel so far before sheeting out that the boom hit the water and wouldn't go any further.
She recovered by leaning out more.
Suzanne's got a good sense of balance which is always useful when you're sailing  Now let's look at this gybe to see if it's any smoother.
Oh yes that's much better
"Wow, she's really taking off now."
"Yes, the wind is stronger out there."
"Considering she's only been sailing for a couple of days, she's doing very well."
If she were more nervous we'd have reached the Topper.
"She's still a little unsure on those tacks, she's easing out the mainsheet as she goes round."
Whatever they were carrying.
They they generally came all year round?
Yes oh yes generally came.
Ah but they always watched th they would be in some place over bad storms you know.
Er er er you know if there was a bad storm somebody would oh you better stay here today too again and he might be there three or four days.
So he would still stay there because he was told about the weather.
And he would know himself.
Mm.
You see it's not what er anybody else would say that it was good weather.
He they knew that they had a great sense of the weather themselves after being out in it.
Did they ever mention to you or your father that they in fact got caught out by the weather?
Oh well sometimes yes they would be very wet when they would come.
And when they would offer to no no they wouldn't they would have their own way of drying it in in their bags they would have another clean or or you would say clothes to put on but we never ever heard of them doing a washing .
Mm.
Or whatever.
Well they would be discarded.
It's it's like I I better not say say this but Irishmen over that when when I when I used to work with Irishmen my word they was good Irishmen.
Very good friends of mine.
But they would work they would never see them with dungarees.
They came with a good suit on and they would go to work with a suit double breasted and then and they would  work there and make a lot of money and when the next thing they would do they would hit into town and get all rigged out and then that was them from top to bottom from their hat right to their feet and then they were hitting the road then.
Yes I could say that that's true about Irishmen.
Mm.
The the tramps never mentioned some of the places they were actually forced to stay whether it was under a road bridge or?
Oh oh yes they yes they would stay under a road bridge too because you would see the er er if you would look a a bridge and they would say oh there's a tramp  there's a place there if you could tell me and you would see the rocks put up and where the bed was always above water level oh yes.
Mm.
Below the certain bridges.
Mm.
Depending how far away a house you see was and how they would be.
But never two of them meet together.
We we you never know that.
They would be always er passing.
They didn't go round like that they were very loners as you would say.
Okay would you like to start then?
Right has everyone had a chance to look at some stuff since last time?
Much.
"Okay Sally-Ann, have you had a chance to look at some of the things which we're gonna do today as well?"
"I haven't had a look at any books at all but, erm I was worried about ."
"Okay so do you want to run us through some of the things that  we haven't really discussed in detail of what we're gonna talk about in here today, specifically have we, I mean I thought something along the lines of er  the nature and extent of sexual variations in English, or any other language you want."
So in what way can it differ Men and women differ in conversation? and you can make it specific you can just discuss it and make very specific interruptions or turn-taking if you want.
On the other hand you could talk about things in general what the different aspects in the  speech are
being in other languages as well.
Is this
"yeah I mean okay  cover the languages to show how they did it properly, so if there is something else you want to bring in then that would be good."
"But I suppose it would mainly worthwhile concentrating on English, because that's where most of the data's from."
"Er I've got some notes here which I can go through  wouldn't actually be necessary but  When Sally-Ann's going through her notes if anyone else would like raise anything which backs it up or disagrees with it or whatever then, you know please you know butt in and say whatever think might might be relevant at the time."
have you stopped the erm  the
The don't  before Easter though.
What ?
"I'm not quite sure when the official handing in date for this essay is, because of the fact that some essays have overrun from last term."
"I suppose that really, probably is Friday week three but, I don't suppose it has to be."
Which reminds me.
Have I got your last essay in yet or not?
I'm a little bit confused  there and I can't get it out.
Okay.
Honest.
Okay.
Well like I say I'll I'll mark the rest of them when I've got them all in.
I can't really mark then till I don I don't want to mark them until I've got them all in cos otherwise it's not really fair  so hopefully next week sometime.
"I  this morning, I've been running around  and I can't get it out ."
What is it on WordPerfect?
Hm.
I keep getting  and things like that.
Oh maybe  could go to the advisory after I think they're open till five.
Mm.
If people are new we need to train them to get the maximum competent level don't we?
If they've been with us for quite some time there are always ways we can enhance people's skills aren't there?
"There are always ways that we could make people more effective or help people to  got the wrong flip, but, but to grow into other jobs."
"So that's the training cycle  and we believe that if you follow that approach to training, then it will help you to be very effective and successful."
That's something that we definitely do here.
Right first of all  I said it was an overview and that's all it was.
"What we wanted to look at to start with was why training is so important, whose responsibility training is and lastly a systematic approach to training."
"What we're gonna do now, it's just coming up to twenty past three, so we'll take a tea break and then after tea we'll come back and we'll spend about an hour or so looking at identifying trainees."
We'll look at what you're currently doing and we also suggest to you something that you could be doing.
Any questions?
Quite happy?
"Right, so we'll take tea then."
It's just coming up to twenty past three we'll take fifteen minutes.
"That's a bit impressive Dawn, fifteen minutes"
blimey.
We were only given ten on the first day.
unfortunately
Yeah and I need the diction I dunno why .
"Asking questions referring, do you get that situation whereby you're told something two or three times and yet they keep coming back?"
"Is it a training need, or could it just be the fact that if they pass it on to you, they know you're dead?"
"Two aspects of that, but I think that's a good way of identifying training."
"Yeah, we're on the training cycle again  another one."
contact with the outside world  customer services
"So what would you, how would you identify from that?"
There's no margin
So we got two then on to errors and erm complaints.
Yeah?
Yeah.
What you said?
Yeah.
"It says, you know broadening it out a bit so we can be a bit more specific."
Alright.
"So when, and I would agree with you again, so when are the teachers going to be accountable, when is somebody who is a bad teacher and heck there are quite a few of them, you know it only takes a couple in every school to make it difficult for the rest, going to be got rid of you know you are not up to the mark out."
There there are systems in place in schools already for that and there always have been.
You jest with me now come on we're we're we're being serious Noel if you are a teacher it is almost impossible to sack you.
Almost totally impossible.
That's simply not true.
There there are disciplinary procedures in in all schools erm which are there to be used.
Why are they never used then?
Are all teachers too good to be sacked because it is  it is as rare as erm teeth in chickens.
I think it's I think it's very easy to er to ex exaggerate the problem  to take one anecdotal evidence of of one about one or two cases and maybe about one or two people and say this is a major problem in every school.
Let me put it this way to you Noel
I don't think it is.
Let me put it to you this way you know as well as I do people who really ought to be doing something else other than teaching.
You know that as well as I do and those people don't seem to be given the encouragement to move on to another profession.
I I
Some are some are promoted to head teachers I know and I knew you were going to say that.
I wasn't going to say  that no .
Erm no I I honestly don't think that er that the the problem is as big as as big as you you say it is and I I think the the structures are there to deal with that and if if people had you know if people used them then they would they would work and they  from time to time that they are used and you know it it is not impossible to get rid of rid of a teacher in in the way you are suggesting.
Okay Noel thank you for your er your time and being a good sport this afternoon and I hear you have a little one you had better go back and sort things out.
That's right.
Okay.
Okay thanks.
Thanks a lot Noel bye bye.
Noel  from the er N U T.
"Erm I don't know what this is serious point actually if if you fancy yourself as one of these so called mums and I think it is a little patronizing the er title of a mums' army of teachers, if you think that maybe you could do that and you'd be interested in doing that and you think it's quite a good idea I'd be interested in hearing from you, all right?"

"When the dusk came , Ernest and Maxwell had to catch the last train for town , and the other guests went home , with the exception of Bertha , who was to stay all night ."
"Just as soon as her resignation could be effected , she was to join her brother ."
"`` Meanwhile , I 'll see about getting a house to put you in , '' said Max ."
"`` No more boarding out for me , Ernest ."
You may consider me as a family man henceforth . ''

A Correspondence and A Climax At sunset Sidney hurried to her room to take off the soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking .
She had milked eight cows and pumped water for the milk-cans afterward in the fag-end of a hot summer day .
"She did that every night , but tonight she had hurried more than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the early farm bedtime ."
She had been thinking it out while she milked the cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn .
This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life .
"Existence would have been , so Sidney thought , a dreary , unbearable blank without it ."
She cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to her rosy fingertips .
As she slipped into her blue-print afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below .
Sidney ran out to the dark little entry and leaned over the stair railing .
"Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing , crying , quarrelling children , and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl 's disgusted nostrils ."
Aunt Jane was standing at the foot of the stairs with a lamp in one hand and a year-old baby clinging to the other .
She was a big shapeless woman with a round good-natured face -- cheerful and vulgar as a sunflower was Aunt Jane at all times and occasions .
"`` I want to run over and see how Mrs. Brixby is this evening , Siddy , and you must take care of the baby till I get back . ''"
Sidney sighed and went downstairs for the baby .
It never would have occurred to her to protest or be petulant about it .
"She had all her aunt 's sweetness of disposition , if she resembled her in nothing else ."
"She had not grumbled because she had to rise at four that morning , get breakfast , milk the cows , bake bread , prepare seven children for school , get dinner , preserve twenty quarts of strawberries , get tea , and milk the cows again ."
"All her days were alike as far as hard work and dullness went , but she accepted them cheerfully and uncomplainingly ."
But she did resent having to look after the baby when she wanted to write her letter .
"She carried the baby to her room , spread a quilt on the floor for him to sit on , and gave him a box of empty spools to play with ."
"Fortunately he was a phlegmatic infant , fond of staying in one place , and not given to roaming about in search of adventures ; but Sidney knew she would have to keep an eye on him , and it would be distracting to literary effort ."
She got out her box of paper and sat down by the little table at the window with a small kerosene lamp at her elbow .
`` I suppose that 's it .
"Well , I like it , and I shall keep on trying , for being loved by every one is about the nicest thing in the world ."
"Is n't it , Ed ? ''"
"asked Jack , with a gentle tweak of the ear as he put a question which he knew would get no answer , for Ed was so modest he could not see wherein he differed from other boys , nor believe that the sunshine he saw in other faces was only the reflection from his own ."
"Sunday evening Mrs. Minot sat by the fire , planning how she should tell some good news she had been saving up all day ."
"Mrs. Pecq knew it , and seemed so delighted that she went about smiling as if she did not know what trouble meant , and could not do enough for the family ."
"She was downstairs now , seeing that the clothes were properly prepared for the wash , so there was no one in the Bird Room but Mamma and the children ."
"Frank was reading up all he could find about some Biblical hero mentioned in the day 's sermon ; Jill lay where she had lain for nearly four long months , and though her face was pale and thin with the confinement , there was an expression on it now sweeter even than health ."
"Jack sat on the rug beside her , looking at a white carnation through the magnifying glass , while she was enjoying the perfume of a red one as she talked to him ."
"`` If you look at the white petals you 'll see that they sparkle like marble , and go winding a long way down to the middle of the flower where it grows sort of rosy ; and in among the small , curly leaves , like fringed curtains , you can see the little green fairy sitting all alone ."
"Your mother showed me that , and I think it is very pretty ."
"I call it a ` fairy , ' but it is really where the seeds are hidden and the sweet smell comes from . ''"
"Jill spoke softly lest she should disturb the others , and , as she turned to push up her pillow , she saw Mrs. Minot looking at her with a smile she did not understand ."
"`` Did you speak , 'm ? ''"
"she asked , smiling back again , without in the least knowing why ."
"`` No , dear ."
"I was listening and thinking what a pretty little story one could make out of your fairy living alone down there , and only known by her perfume . ''"
"`` Tell it , Mamma ."
"It is time for our story , and that would be a nice one , I guess , '' said Jack , who was as fond of stories as when he sat in his mother 's lap and chuckled over the hero of the beanstalk ."
"`` We do n't have fairy tales on Sunday , you know , '' began Jill regretfully ."
"`` Call it a parable , and have a moral to it , then it will be all right , '' put in Frank , as he shut his big book , having found what he wanted ."
"`` I like stories about saints , and the good and wonderful things they did , '' said Jill , who enjoyed the wise and interesting bits Mrs. Minot often found for her in grown-up books , for Jill had thoughtful times , and asked questions which showed that she was growing fast in mind if not in body ."
"`` This is a true story ; but I will disguise it a little , and call it ` The Miracle of Saint Lucy , ' '' began Mrs. Minot , seeing a way to tell her good news and amuse the children likewise ."
"Frank retired to the easy-chair , that he might sleep if the tale should prove too childish for him ."
"Jill settled herself among her cushions , and Jack lay flat upon the rug , with his feet up , so that he could admire his red slippers and rest his knee , which ached ."
`` Once upon a time there was a queen who had two princes . ''
`` Was n't there a princess ? ''
"asked Jack , interested at once ."
"`` No ; and it was a great sorrow to the queen that she had no little daughter , for the sons were growing up , and she was often very lonely ."
"`` Like Snowdrop 's mother , '' whispered Jill ."
"`` Now , do n't keep interrupting , children , or we never shall get on , '' said Frank , more anxious to hear about the boys that were than the girl that was not ."
"`` One day , when the princes were out -- ahem !"
"Wait till I go , and then we will stay all day , and pick as many berries as you want . ''"
"`` You never do go , you are so busy , and I 'm tired of waiting ."
I 'd rather go and get the berries for you all myself .
"I love to pick 'em , and I want to fill my new pail dreffly , '' sobbed Rob ."
"The pathetic sight of great tears tinkling into the dear new pail , and threatening to fill it with salt water instead of huckleberries , touched all the ladies present ."
"His mother patted the weeper on his back ; Daisy offered to stay home with him ; and Nan said , in her decided way , `` Let him come ; I 'll take care of him . ''"
"`` If Franz was going I would n't mind , for he is very careful ; but he is haying with the father , and I 'm not sure about the rest of you , '' began Mrs. Bhaer ."
"`` It 's so far , '' put in Jack ."
"`` I 'd carry him if I was going wish I was , '' said Dan , with a sigh ."
"`` Thank you , dear , but you must take care of your foot ."
I wish I could go .
"Stop a minute , I think I can manage it after all ; '' and Mrs. Bhaer ran out to the steps , waving her apron wildly ."
"Silas was just driving away in the hay-cart , but turned back , and agreed at once , when Mrs. Jo proposed that he should take the whole party to the pasture , and go for them at five o'clock ."
"`` It will delay your work a little , but never mind ; we will pay you in huckleberry pies , '' said Mrs. Jo , knowing Silas 's weak point ."
"His rough , brown face brightened up , and he said , with a cheery `` Haw !"
haw ! ''
"`` Wal now , Mis ' Bhaer , if you go to bribin ' of me , I shall give in right away . ''"
"`` Now , boys , I have arranged it so that you can all go , '' said Mrs. Bhaer , running back again , much relieved , for she loved to make them happy , and always felt miserable when she had disturbed the serenity of her little sons ; for she believed that the small hopes and plans and pleasures of children should be tenderly respected by grown-up people , and never rudely thwarted or ridiculed ."
`` Can I go ? ''
"said Dan , delighted ."
`` I thought especially of you .
"Be careful , and never mind the berries , but sit about and enjoy the lovely things which you know how to find all about you , '' answered Mrs. Bhaer , who remembered his kind offer to her boy ."
`` Me too !
me too ! ''
"sung Rob , dancing with joy , and clapping his precious pail and cover like castanets ."
"`` Yes , and Daisy and Nan must take good care of you ."
"Be at the bars at five o'clock , and Silas will come for you all . ''"
"Robby cast himself upon his mother in a burst of gratitude , promising to bring her every berry he picked , and not eat one ."
"Then they were all packed into the hay-cart , and went rattling away , the brightest face among the dozen being that of Rob , as he sat between his two temporary little mothers , beaming upon the whole world , and waving his best hat ; for his indulgent mamma had not the heart to bereave him of it , since this was a gala-day to him ."
"Such a happy afternoon as they had , in spite of the mishaps which usually occur on such expeditions !"
"Of course Tommy came to grief , tumbled upon a hornet 's nest and got stung ; but being used to woe , he bore the smart manfully , till Dan suggested the application of damp earth , which much assuaged the pain ."
"Daisy saw a snake , and flying from it lost half her berries ; but Demi helped her to fill up again , and discussed reptiles most learnedly the while ."
"Emil went to bed sick , and Dan was an unpleasant spectacle for a week ."
"But the lawless lad had no thought of obeying , and soon transgressed again ."
"One Saturday afternoon as a party of the boys went out to play , Tommy said , `` Let 's go down to the river , and cut a lot of new fish-poles . ''"
"`` Take Toby to drag them back , and one of us can ride him down , '' proposed Stuffy , who hated to walk ."
"`` That means you , I suppose ; well , hurry up , lazy-bones , '' said Dan ."
"Away they went , and having got the poles were about to go home , when Demi unluckily said to Tommy , who was on Toby with a long rod in his hand , `` You look like the picture of the man in the bull-fight , only you have n't got a red cloth , or pretty clothes on . ''"
"`` I 'd like to see one ; there 's old Buttercup in the big meadow , ride at her , Tom , and see her run , '' proposed Dan , bent on mischief ."
"`` No , you must n't , '' began Demi , who was learning to distrust Dan 's propositions ."
"`` Why not , little fuss-button ? ''"
demanded Dan .
`` I do n't think Uncle Fritz would like it . ''
`` Did he ever say we must not have a bull-fight ? ''
"`` No , I do n't think he ever did , '' admitted Demi ."
`` Then hold your tongue .
"Drive on , Tom , and here 's a red rag to flap at the old thing ."
"I 'll help you to stir her up , '' and over the wall went Dan , full of the new game , and the rest followed like a flock of sheep ; even Demi , who sat upon the bars , and watched the fun with interest ."
"Poor Buttercup was not in a very good mood , for she had been lately bereft of her calf , and mourned for the little thing most dismally ."
"Just now she regarded all mankind as her enemies -LRB- and I do not blame her -RRB- , so when the matadore came prancing towards her with the red handkerchief flying at the end of his long lance , she threw up her head , and gave a most appropriate `` Moo ! ''"
"Tommy rode gallantly at her , and Toby recognizing an old friend , was quite willing to approach ; but when the lance came down on her back with a loud whack , both cow and donkey were surprised and disgusted ."
"Toby back with a bray of remonstrance , and Buttercup lowered her horns angrily ."
"`` At her again , Tom ; she 's jolly cross , and will do it capitally ! ''"
"called Dan , coming up behind with another rod , while Jack and Ned followed his example ."
"Seeing herself thus beset , and treated with such disrespect , Buttercup trotted round the field , getting more and more bewildered and excited every moment , for whichever way she turned , there was a dreadful boy , yelling and brandishing a new and very disagreeable sort of whip ."
"It was great fun for them , but real misery for her , till she lost patience and turned the tables in the most unexpected manner ."
"All at once she wheeled short round , and charged full at her old friend Toby , whose conduct cut her to the heart ."
"Poor slow Toby backed so precipitately that he tripped over a stone , and down went horse , matadore , and all , in one ignominious heap , while distracted Buttercup took a surprising leap over the wall , and galloped wildly out of sight down the road ."
"`` Catch her , stop her , head her off !"
"run , boys , run ! ''"
"shouted Dan , tearing after her at his best pace , for she was Mr. Bhaer 's pet Alderney , and if anything happened to her , Dan feared it would be all over with him ."
Such a running and racing and bawling and puffing as there was before she was caught !
"The fish-poles were left behind ; Toby was trotted nearly off his legs in the chase ; and every boy was red , breathless , and scared ."
"They found poor Buttercup at last in a flower garden , where she had taken refuge , worn out with the long run ."
Her cheek was swollen and her face ached .
"The schoolroom was cold and smoky , for the fire refused to burn and the children were huddled about it in shivering groups ."
Anne sent them to their seats with a sharper tone than she had ever used before .
Anthony Pye strutted to his with his usual impertinent swagger and she saw him whisper something to his seat-mate and then glance at her with a grin .
"Never , so it seemed to Anne , had there been so many squeaky pencils as there were that morning ; and when Barbara Shaw came up to the desk with a sum she tripped over the coal scuttle with disastrous results ."
"The coal rolled to every part of the room , her slate was broken into fragments , and when she picked herself up , her face , stained with coal dust , sent the boys into roars of laughter ."
Anne turned from the second reader class which she was hearing .
"`` Really , Barbara , '' she said icily , `` if you can not move without falling over something you 'd better remain in your seat ."
It is positively disgraceful for a girl of your age to be so awkward . ''
"Poor Barbara stumbled back to her desk , her tears combining with the coal dust to produce an effect truly grotesque ."
"Never before had her beloved , sympathetic teacher spoken to her in such a tone or fashion , and Barbara was heartbroken ."
"Anne herself felt a prick of conscience but it only served to increase her mental irritation , and the second reader class remember that lesson yet , as well as the unmerciful infliction of arithmetic that followed ."
Just as Anne was snapping the sums out St. Clair Donnell arrived breathlessly .
"`` You are half an hour late , St. Clair , '' Anne reminded him frigidly ."
`` Why is this ? ''
"`` Please , miss , I had to help ma make a pudding for dinner 'cause we 're expecting company and Clarice Almira 's sick , '' was St. Clair 's answer , given in a perfectly respectful voice but nevertheless provocative of great mirth among his mates ."
"`` Take your seat and work out the six problems on page eighty-four of your arithmetic for punishment , '' said Anne ."
St. Clair looked rather amazed at her tone but he went meekly to his desk and took out his slate .
Then he stealthily passed a small parcel to Joe Sloane across the aisle .
Anne caught him in the act and jumped to a fatal conclusion about that parcel .
Old Mrs. Hiram Sloane had lately taken to making and selling `` nut cakes '' by way of adding to her scanty income .
The cakes were specially tempting to small boys and for several weeks Anne had had not a little trouble in regard to them .
"On their way to school the boys would invest their spare cash at Mrs. Hiram 's , bring the cakes along with them to school , and , if possible , eat them and treat their mates during school hours ."
"Anne had warned them that if they brought any more cakes to school they would be confiscated ; and yet here was St. Clair Donnell coolly passing a parcel of them , wrapped up in the blue and white striped paper Mrs. Hiram used , under her very eyes ."
"`` Joseph , '' said Anne quietly , `` bring that parcel here . ''"
"Joe , startled and abashed , obeyed ."
He was a fat urchin who always blushed and stuttered when he was frightened .
Never did anybody look more guilty than poor Joe at that moment .
"`` Throw it into the fire , '' said Anne ."
Joe looked very blank .
"`` P ... p ... p ... lease , m ... m ... miss , '' he began ."
"`` Do as I tell you , Joseph , without any words about it . ''"
"Though I had lived by the shore all my life , I seemed never to have been near the sea till then ."
The smell of tar and salt was something new .
"I saw the most wonderful figureheads , that had all been far over the ocean ."
"I saw , besides , many old sailors , with rings in their ears , and whiskers curled in ringlets , and tarry pigtails , and their swaggering , clumsy sea-walk ; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted ."
"And I was going to sea myself , to sea in a schooner , with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen , to sea , bound for an unknown island , and to seek for buried treasure !"
"While I was still in this delightful dream , we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney , all dressed out like a sea-officer , in stout blue cloth , coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor 's walk ."
"`` Here you are , '' he cried , `` and the doctor came last night from London ."
Bravo !
The ship 's company complete ! ''
"`` Oh , sir , '' cried I , `` when do we sail ? ''"
`` Sail ! ''
says he .
`` We sail tomorrow ! ''
"8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver , at the sign of the Spy-glass , and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign ."
"I set off , overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen , and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales , for the dock was now at its busiest , until I found the tavern in question ."
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment .
The sign was newly painted ; the windows had neat red curtains ; the floor was cleanly sanded .
"There was a street on each side and an open door on both , which made the large , low room pretty clear to see in , in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke ."
"The customers were mostly seafaring men , and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door , almost afraid to enter ."
"As I was waiting , a man came out of a side room , and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John ."
"His left leg was cut off close by the hip , and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch , which he managed with wonderful dexterity , hopping about upon it like a bird ."
"He was very tall and strong , with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale , but intelligent and smiling ."
"Indeed , he seemed in the most cheerful spirits , whistling as he moved about among the tables , with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests ."
"Now , to tell you the truth , from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney 's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow ."
But one look at the man before me was enough .
"I had seen the captain , and Black Dog , and the blind man , Pew , and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like -- a very different creature , according to me , from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord ."
"I plucked up courage at once , crossed the threshold , and walked right up to the man where he stood , propped on his crutch , talking to a customer ."
"`` Mr. Silver , sir ? ''"
"I asked , holding out the note ."
"`` Yes , my lad , '' said he ; `` such is my name , to be sure ."
And who may you be ? ''
"And then as he saw the squire 's letter , he seemed to me to give something almost like a start ."
"Tommy in bed , Teddy wheezing like a little grampus , Mrs. Jo quite used up , and the whole flock of boys so excited that they all talked at once , and almost dragged him by main force to view the ruins ."
"Under his quiet management things soon fell into order , for every one felt that he was equal to a dozen conflagrations , and worked with a will at whatever task he gave them ."
"There was no school that morning , but by afternoon the damaged room was put to rights , the invalids were better , and there was time to hear and judge the little culprits quietly ."
"Nat and Tommy told their parts in the mischief , and were honestly sorry for the danger they had brought to the dear old house and all in it ."
"But Dan put on his devil-may-care look , and would not own that there was much harm done ."
"Now , of all things , Mr. Bhaer hated drinking , gambling , and swearing ; smoking he had given up that the lads might not be tempted to try it , and it grieved and angered him deeply to find that the boy , with whom he had tried to be most forbearing , should take advantage of his absence to introduce these forbidden vices , and teach his innocent little lads to think it manly and pleasant to indulge in them ."
"He talked long and earnestly to the assembled boys , and ended by saying , with an air of mingled firmness and regret , `` I think Tommy is punished enough , and that scar on his arm will remind him for a long time to let these things alone ."
"Nat 's fright will do for him , for he is really sorry , and does try to obey me ."
"But you , Dan , have been many times forgiven , and yet it does no good ."
"I can not have my boys hurt by your bad example , nor my time wasted in talking to deaf ears , so you can say good-bye to them all , and tell Nursey to put up your things in my little black bag . ''"
`` Oh !
"sir , where is he going ? ''"
cried Nat .
"`` To a pleasant place up in the country , where I sometimes send boys when they do n't do well here ."
"Mr. Page is a kind man , and Dan will be happy there if he chooses to do his best . ''"
`` Will he ever come back ? ''
asked Demi .
`` That will depend on himself ; I hope so . ''
"As he spoke , Mr. Bhaer left the room to write his letter to Mr. Page , and the boys crowded round Dan very much as people do about a man who is going on a long and perilous journey to unknown regions ."
"`` I wonder if you 'll like it , '' began Jack ."
"`` Sha n't stay if I do n't , '' said Dan coolly ."
`` Where will you go ? ''
asked Nat .
"`` I may go to sea , or out west , or take a look at California , '' answered Dan , with a reckless air that quite took away the breath of the little boys ."
"`` Oh , do n't !"
"stay with Mr. Page awhile and then come back here ; do , Dan , '' pleaded Nat , much affected at the whole affair ."
"`` I do n't care where I go , or how long I stay , and I 'll be hanged if I ever come back here , '' with which wrathful speech Dan went away to put up his things , every one of which Mr. Bhaer had given him ."
"That was the only good-bye he gave the boys , for they were all talking the matter over in the barn when he came down , and he told Nat not to call them ."
"The wagon stood at the door , and Mrs. Bhaer came out to speak to Dan , looking so sad that his heart smote him , and he said in a low tone , `` May I say good-bye to Teddy ? ''"
"`` Yes , dear ; go in and kiss him , he will miss his Danny very much . ''"
"No one saw the look in Dan 's eyes as he stooped over the crib , and saw the little face light up at first sight of him , but he heard Mrs. Bhaer say pleadingly , `` Ca n't we give the poor lad one more trial , Fritz ? ''"
"and Mr. Bhaer answer in his steady way , `` My dear , it is not best , so let him go where he can do no harm to others , while they do good to him , and by and by he shall come back , I promise you . ''"
"The front door of Four Winds opened directly into a wide , low-ceilinged living room , furnished with simplicity and good taste ."
"Leaving the two men there , Lynde and the old cousin vanished , and Alan found himself talking freely with the Captain who could , as it appeared , talk well on many subjects far removed from Four Winds ."
"He was evidently a clever , self-educated man , somewhat opinionated and given to sarcasm ; he never made any references to his own past life or experiences , but Alan discovered him to be surprisingly well read in politics and science ."
"Sometimes in the pauses of the conversation Alan found the older man looking at him in a furtive way he did not like , but the Captain was such an improvement on what he had been led to expect that he was not inclined to be over critical ."
"At least , this was what he honestly thought ."
He did not suspect that it was because this man was Lynde 's father that he wished to think as well as possible of him .
Presently Lynde came in .
"She had changed her outdoor dress , stained with moss and soil in her fall , for a soft clinging garment of some pale yellow material , and her long , thick braid of hair hung over her shoulder ."
She sat mutely down in a dim corner and took no part in the conversation except to answer briefly the remarks which Alan addressed to her .
Emily came in and lighted the lamp on the table .
"She was as grim and unsmiling as ever , yet she cast a look of satisfaction on Alan as she passed out ."
"One dog lay down at Lynde 's feet , the other sat on his haunches by her side and laid his head on her lap ."
"Rexton and its quiet round of parish duties seemed thousands of miles away from Alan , and he wondered a little if this were not all a dream ."
When he went away the Captain invited him back .
"`` If you like to come , that is , '' he said brusquely , `` and always as the man , not the priest , remember ."
I do n't want you by and by to be slyly slipping in the thin end of any professional wedges .
You 'll waste your time if you do .
"Come as man to man and you 'll be welcome , for I like you -- and it 's few men I like ."
But do n't try to talk religion to me . ''
"`` I never talk religion , '' said Alan emphatically ."
`` I try to live it .
"I 'll not come to your house as a self-appointed missionary , sir , but I shall certainly act and speak at all times as my conscience and my reverence for my vocation demands ."
"If I respect your beliefs , whatever they may be , I shall expect you to respect mine , Captain Oliver . ''"
"`` Oh , I wo n't insult your God , '' said the Captain with a faint sneer ."
Alan went home in a tumult of contending feelings .
"He did not altogether like Captain Anthony -- that was very clear to him , and yet there was something about the man that attracted him ."
"Intellectually he was a worthy foeman , and Alan had often longed for such since coming to Rexton ."
"He missed the keen , stimulating debates of his college days and , now there seemed a chance of renewing them , he was eager to grasp it ."
And Lynde -- how beautiful she was !
What though she shared -- as was not unlikely -- in her father 's lack of belief ?
She could not be essentially irreligious -- that were impossible in a true woman .
Might not this be his opportunity to help her -- to lead her into dearer light ?
`` Now we must fly round and fill up .
"Come , boys , sort out the green and hand us the flowers as we want them ."
"Then we must direct them , and , by the time that is done , you can go and leave them , '' said Jill , setting all to work ."
`` Ed must choose his baskets first .
"These are ours ; but any of those you can have ; '' and Molly pointed to a detachment of gay baskets , set apart from those already partly filled ."
"Ed chose a blue one , and Merry filled it with the rosiest may-flowers , knowing that it was to hang on Mabel 's door-handle ."
"The others did the same , and the pretty work went on , with much fun , till all were filled , and ready for the names or notes ."
"`` Let us have poetry , as we ca n't get wild flowers ."
"That will be rather fine , '' proposed Jill , who liked jingles ."
"All had had some practice at the game parties , and pencils went briskly for a few minutes , while silence reigned , as the poets racked their brains for rhymes , and stared at the blooming array before them for inspiration ."
"`` Oh , dear !"
"I ca n't find a word to rhyme to ` geranium , ' '' sighed Molly , pulling her braid , as if to pump the well of her fancy dry ."
"`` Cranium , '' said Frank , who was getting on bravely with `` Annette '' and `` violet . ''"
`` That is elegant ! ''
"and Molly scribbled away in great glee , for her poems were always funny ones ."
"`` How do you spell anemoly -- the wild flower , I mean ? ''"
"asked Jill , who was trying to compose a very appropriate piece for her best basket , and found it easier to feel love and gratitude than to put them into verse ."
"`` Anemone ; do spell it properly , or you 'll get laughed at , '' answered Gus , wildly struggling to make his lines express great ardor , without being `` too spoony , '' as he expressed it ."
"`` No , I should n't ."
"This person never laughs at other persons ' mistakes , as some persons do , '' replied Jill , with dignity ."
"Jack was desperately chewing his pencil , for he could not get on at all ; but Ed had evidently prepared his poem , for his paper was half full already , and Merry was smiling as she wrote a friendly line or two for Ralph 's basket , as she feared he would be forgotten , and knew he loved kindness even more than he did beauty ."
"`` Now let 's read them , '' proposed Molly , who loved to laugh even at herself ."
"The boys politely declined , and scrambled their notes into the chosen baskets in great haste ; but the girls were less bashful ."
"Jill was invited to begin , and gave her little piece , with the pink hyacinth basket before her , to illustrate her poem ."
"`` TO MY LADY `` There are no flowers in the fields , No green leaves on the tree , No columbines , no violets , No sweet anemone ."
"So I have gathered from my pots All that I have to fill The basket that I hang to-night , With heaps of love from Jill . ''"
`` That 's perfectly sweet !
"Mine is n't ; but I meant it to be funny , '' said Molly , as if there could be any doubt about the following ditty : -- `` Dear Grif , Here is a whiff Of beautiful spring flowers ; The big red rose Is for your nose , As toward the sky it towers ."
"`` Oh , do not frown Upon this crown Of green pinks and blue geranium But think of me When this you see , And put it on your cranium . ''"
"`` O Molly , you will never hear the last of that if Grif gets it , '' said Jill , as the applause subsided , for the boys pronounced it `` tip-top . ''"
"`` Do n't care , he gets the worst of it any way , for there is a pin in that rose , and if he goes to smell the mayflowers underneath he will find a thorn to pay for the tack he put in my rubber boot ."
"I know he will play me some joke to-night , and I mean to be first if I can , '' answered Molly , settling the artificial wreath round the orange-colored canoe which held her effusion ."
"It stood wide open ; within , every corner of the pavement was crowded with fugitive burghers , surrounded by their families and laden with the most precious of their possessions , while , at the high altar , priests in full canonicals were imploring the mercy of God ."
"Even as Dick entered , the loud chorus began to thunder in the vaulted roofs ."
"He hurried through the groups of refugees , and came to the door of the stair that led into the steeple ."
And here a tall churchman stepped before him and arrested his advance .
"`` Whither , my son ? ''"
"he asked , severely ."
"`` My father , '' answered Dick , `` I am here upon an errand of expedition ."
Stay me not .
I command here for my Lord of Gloucester . ''
`` For my Lord of Gloucester ? ''
repeated the priest .
"`` Hath , then , the battle gone so sore ? ''"
"`` The battle , father , is at an end , Lancaster clean sped , my Lord of Risingham -- Heaven rest him !"
-- left upon the field .
"And now , with your good leave , I follow mine affairs . ''"
"And thrusting on one side the priest , who seemed stupefied at the news , Dick pushed open the door and rattled up the stairs four at a bound , and without pause or stumble , till he stepped upon the open platform at the top ."
"Shoreby Church tower not only commanded the town , as in a map , but looked far , on both sides , over sea and land ."
"It was now near upon noon ; the day exceeding bright , the snow dazzling ."
"And as Dick looked around him , he could measure the consequences of the battle ."
"A confused , growling uproar reached him from the streets , and now and then , but very rarely , the clash of steel ."
"Not a ship , not so much as a skiff remained in harbour ; but the sea was dotted with sails and row-boats laden with fugitives ."
"On shore , too , the surface of the snowy meadows was broken up with bands of horsemen , some cutting their way towards the borders of the forest , others , who were doubtless of the Yorkist side , stoutly interposing and beating them back upon the town ."
"Over all the open ground there lay a prodigious quantity of fallen men and horses , clearly defined upon the snow ."
"To complete the picture , those of the foot soldiers as had not found place upon a ship still kept up an archery combat on the borders of the port , and from the cover of the shoreside taverns ."
"In that quarter , also , one or two houses had been fired , and the smoke towered high in the frosty sunlight , and blew off to sea in voluminous folds ."
"Already close upon the margin of the woods , and somewhat in the line of Holywood , one particular clump of fleeing horsemen riveted the attention of the young watcher on the tower ."
"It was fairly numerous ; in no other quarter of the field did so many Lancastrians still hold together ; thus they had left a wide , discoloured wake upon the snow , and Dick was able to trace them step by step from where they had left the town ."
"While Dick stood watching them , they had gained , unopposed , the first fringe of the leafless forest , and , turning a little from their direction , the sun fell for a moment full on their array , as it was relieved against the dusky wood ."
`` Murrey and blue ! ''
cried Dick .
`` I swear it -- murrey and blue ! ''
The next moment he was descending the stairway .
"`` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , '' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"`` And it might melt , '' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"`` Build a house round her , '' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation stone and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
The house was exactly the size of Maimie and perfectly lovely .
"One of her arms was extended and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it , leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were all so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"`` Now we fear it is quite finished , '' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"`` That certainly finishes it , '' they cried reluctantly ."
"`` Not at all , '' cried a glow-worm , `` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . ''"
"`` Wait one moment , '' said a china merchant , `` and I shall make you a saucer . ''"
"Now alas , it was absolutely finished ."
"Oh , dear no !"
"`` Gracious me , '' cried a brass manufacturer , `` there 's no handle on the door , '' and he put one on ."
An ironmonger added a scraper and an old lady ran up with a door-mat .
"Carpenters arrived with a water-butt , and the painters insisted on painting it ."
Finished at last !
`` Finished !
"how can it be finished , '' the plumber demanded scornfully , `` before hot and cold are put in ? ''"
and he put in hot and cold .
"Then an army of gardeners arrived with fairy carts and spades and seeds and bulbs and forcing-houses , and soon they had a flower garden to the right of the verandah and a vegetable garden to the left , and roses and clematis on the walls of the house , and in less time than five minutes all these dear things were in full bloom ."
"Oh , how beautiful the little house was now !"
"But it was at last finished true as true , and they had to leave it and return to the dance ."
"They all kissed their hands to it as they went away , and the last to go was Brownie ."
She stayed a moment behind the others to drop a pleasant dream down the chimney .
"All through the night the exquisite little house stood there in the Figs taking care of Maimie , and she never knew ."
"She slept until the dream was quite finished and woke feeling deliciously cosy just as morning was breaking from its egg , and then she almost fell asleep again , and then she called out , `` Tony , '' for she thought she was at home in the nursery ."
"`` Mr. Hyde told me ; he 's been among 'em , and can talk their talk , and likes 'em , '' began Dan , flattered by their attention , but rather embarrassed by having a grown-up listener ."
`` What is wampum for ? ''
"asked curious Demi , from his perch ."
"The others asked questions likewise , and , before he knew it , Dan was reeling off all Mr. Hyde had told him , as they sailed down the river a few weeks before ."
"Mr. Laurie listened well , but found the boy more interesting than the Indians , for Mrs. Jo had told him about Dan , and he rather took a fancy to the wild lad , who ran away as he himself had often longed to do , and who was slowly getting tamed by pain and patience ."
"`` I 've been thinking that it would be a good plan for you fellows to have a museum of your own ; a place in which to collect all the curious and interesting things that you find , and make , and have given you ."
"Mrs. Jo is too kind to complain , but it is rather hard for her to have the house littered up with all sorts of rattletraps , half-a-pint of dor-bugs in one of her best vases , for instance , a couple of dead bats nailed up in the back entry , wasps nests tumbling down on people 's heads , and stones lying round everywhere , enough to pave the avenue ."
"There are not many women who would stand that sort of thing , are there , now ? ''"
"As Mr. Laurie spoke with a merry look in his eyes , the boys laughed and nudged one another , for it was evident that some one told tales out of school , else how could he know of the existence of these inconvenient treasures ."
"`` Where can we put them , then ? ''"
"said Demi , crossing his legs and leaning down to argue the question ."
`` In the old carriage-house . ''
"`` But it leaks , and there is n't any window , nor any place to put things , and it 's all dust and cobwebs , '' began Nat ."
"`` Wait till Gibbs and I have touched it up a bit , and then see how you like it ."
"He is to come over on Monday to get it ready ; then next Saturday I shall come out , and we will fix it up , and make the beginning , at least , of a fine little museum ."
"Every one can bring his things , and have a place for them ; and Dan is to be the head man , because he knows most about such matters , and it will be quiet , pleasant work for him now that he ca n't knock about much . ''"
`` Wo n't that be jolly ? ''
"cried Nat , while Dan smiled all over his face and had not a word to say , but hugged his book , and looked at Mr. Laurie as if he thought him one of the greatest public benefactors that ever blessed the world ."
"`` Shall I go round again , sir ? ''"
"asked Peter , as they came to the gate , after two slow turns about the half-mile triangle ."
"`` No , we must be prudent , else we ca n't come again ."
"I must go over the premises , take a look at the carriage-house , and have a little talk with Mrs. Jo before I go ; '' and , having deposited Dan on his sofa to rest and enjoy his book , Uncle Teddy went off to have a frolic with the lads who were raging about the place in search of him ."
"Leaving the little girls to mess up-stairs , Mrs. Bhaer sat down by Dan , and listened to his eager account of the drive till the flock returned , dusty , warm , and much excited about the new museum , which every one considered the most brilliant idea of the age ."
"`` I always wanted to endow some sort of an institution , and I am going to begin with this , '' said Mr. Laurie , sitting down on a stool at Mrs. Jo 's feet ."
`` You have endowed one already .
What do you call this ? ''
"and Mrs. Jo pointed to the happy-faced lads , who had camped upon the floor about him ."
"`` I call it a very promising Bhaer-garden , and I 'm proud to be a member of it ."
Did you know I was the head boy in this school ? ''
"he asked , turning to Dan , and changing the subject skilfully , for he hated to be thanked for the generous things he did ."
`` I thought Franz was ! ''
"answered Dan , wondering what the man meant ."
A ` phone message has just come through from Charlottetown that Woodrow Wilson has sent that German ambassador man to the right about at last .
They tell me that means war .
"So I begin to think that Woodrow 's heart is in the right place after all , wherever his head may be , and I am going to commandeer a little sugar and celebrate the occasion with some fudge , despite the howls of the Food Board ."
I thought that submarine business would bring things to a crisis .
I told Cousin Sophia so when she said it was the beginning of the end for the Allies . ''
"`` Do n't let the doctor hear of the fudge , Susan , '' said Anne , with a smile ."
`` You know he has laid down very strict rules for us along the lines of economy the government has asked for . ''
"`` Yes , Mrs. Dr. dear , and a man should be master in his own household , and his women folk should bow to his decrees ."
I flatter myself that I am becoming quite efficient in economizing '' -- Susan had taken to using certain German terms with killing effect -- `` but one can exercise a little gumption on the quiet now and then .
"Shirley was wishing for some of my fudge the other day -- the Susan brand , as he called it -- and I said ` The first victory there is to celebrate I shall make you some . '"
"I consider this news quite equal to a victory , and what the doctor does not know will never grieve him ."
"I take the whole responsibility , Mrs. Dr. dear , so do not you vex your conscience . ''"
Susan spoiled Shirley shamelessly that winter .
"He came home from Queen 's every week-end , and Susan had all his favourite dishes for him , in so far as she could evade or wheedle the doctor , and waited on him hand and foot ."
"Though she talked war constantly to everyone else she never mentioned it to him or before him , but she watched him like a cat watching a mouse ; and when the German retreat from the Bapaume salient began and continued , Susan 's exultation was linked up with something deeper than anything she expressed ."
Surely the end was in sight -- would come now before -- anyone else -- could go .
`` Things are coming our way at last .
"We have got the Germans on the run , '' she boasted ."
"`` The United States has declared war at last , as I always believed they would , in spite of Woodrow 's gift for letter writing , and you will see they will go into it with a vim since I understand that is their habit , when they do start ."
"And we have got the Germans on the run , too . ''"
"`` The States mean well , '' moaned Cousin Sophia , `` but all the vim in the world can not put them on the fighting line this spring , and the Allies will be finished before that ."
The Germans are just luring them on .
That man Simonds says their retreat has put the Allies in a hole . ''
"`` That man Simonds has said more than he will ever live to make good , '' retorted Susan ."
`` I do not worry myself about his opinion as long as Lloyd George is Premier of England .
He will not be bamboozled and that you may tie to .
Things look good to me .
"The U. S. is in the war , and we have got Kut and Bagdad back -- and I would not be surprised to see the Allies in Berlin by June -- and the Russians , too , since they have got rid of the Czar ."
"That , in my opinion was a good piece of work . ''"
"`` Time will show if it is , '' said Cousin Sophia , who would have been very indignant if anyone had told her that she would rather see Susan put to shame as a seer , than a successful overthrow of tyranny , or even the march of the Allies down Unter den Linden ."
"But then the woes of the Russian people were quite unknown to Cousin Sophia , while this aggravating , optimistic Susan was an ever-present thorn in her side ."
"Just at that moment Shirley was sitting on the edge of the table in the living-room , swinging his legs -- a brown , ruddy , wholesome lad , from top to toe , every inch of him -- and saying coolly , `` Mother and dad , I was eighteen last Monday ."
But that 's past praying for ; and ye must lie on your bed the way ye made it .
And the point in hand is just this : what did ye pay him ? ''
`` Has he tauld ye himsel ' ? ''
asked my uncle .
"`` That 's my concern , '' said Alan ."
"`` Weel , '' said my uncle , `` I dinnae care what he said , he leed , and the solemn God 's truth is this , that I gave him twenty pound ."
"But I 'll be perfec ` ly honest with ye : forby that , he was to have the selling of the lad in Caroliny , whilk would be as muckle mair , but no from my pocket , ye see . ''"
"`` Thank you , Mr. Thomson ."
"That will do excellently well , '' said the lawyer , stepping forward ; and then mighty civilly , `` Good-evening , Mr. Balfour , '' said he ."
"And , `` Good-evening , Uncle Ebenezer , '' said I. And , `` It 's a braw nicht , Mr. Balfour , '' added Torrance ."
"Never a word said my uncle , neither black nor white ; but just sat where he was on the top door-step and stared upon us like a man turned to stone ."
"Alan filched away his blunderbuss ; and the lawyer , taking him by the arm , plucked him up from the doorstep , led him into the kitchen , whither we all followed , and set him down in a chair beside the hearth , where the fire was out and only a rush-light burning ."
"There we all looked upon him for a while , exulting greatly in our success , but yet with a sort of pity for the man 's shame ."
"`` Come , come , Mr. Ebenezer , '' said the lawyer , `` you must not be down-hearted , for I promise you we shall make easy terms ."
"In the meanwhile give us the cellar key , and Torrance shall draw us a bottle of your father 's wine in honour of the event . ''"
"Then , turning to me and taking me by the hand , `` Mr. David , '' says he , `` I wish you all joy in your good fortune , which I believe to be deserved . ''"
"And then to Alan , with a spice of drollery , `` Mr. Thomson , I pay you my compliment ; it was most artfully conducted ; but in one point you somewhat outran my comprehension ."
Do I understand your name to be James ?
or Charles ?
"or is it George , perhaps ? ''"
"`` And why should it be any of the three , sir ? ''"
"quoth Alan , drawing himself up , like one who smelt an offence ."
"`` Only , sir , that you mentioned a king 's name , '' replied Rankeillor ; `` and as there has never yet been a King Thomson , or his fame at least has never come my way , I judged you must refer to that you had in baptism . ''"
"This was just the stab that Alan would feel keenest , and I am free to confess he took it very ill ."
"Not a word would he answer , but stepped off to the far end of the kitchen , and sat down and sulked ; and it was not till I stepped after him , and gave him my hand , and thanked him by title as the chief spring of my success , that he began to smile a bit , and was at last prevailed upon to join our party ."
"By that time we had the fire lighted , and a bottle of wine uncorked ; a good supper came out of the basket , to which Torrance and I and Alan set ourselves down ; while the lawyer and my uncle passed into the next chamber to consult ."
"They stayed there closeted about an hour ; at the end of which period they had come to a good understanding , and my uncle and I set our hands to the agreement in a formal manner ."
"By the terms of this , my uncle bound himself to satisfy Rankeillor as to his intromissions , and to pay me two clear thirds of the yearly income of Shaws ."
"So the beggar in the ballad had come home ; and when I lay down that night on the kitchen chests , I was a man of means and had a name in the country ."
"Alan and Torrance and Rankeillor slept and snored on their hard beds ; but for me who had lain out under heaven and upon dirt and stones , so many days and nights , and often with an empty belly , and in fear of death , this good change in my case unmanned me more than any of the former evil ones ; and I lay till dawn , looking at the fire on the roof and planning the future ."
"CHAPTER XXX GOOD-BYE So far as I was concerned myself , I had come to port ; but I had still Alan , to whom I was so much beholden , on my hands ; and I felt besides a heavy charge in the matter of the murder and James of the Glens ."
"On both these heads I unbosomed to Rankeillor the next morning , walking to and fro about six of the clock before the house of Shaws , and with nothing in view but the fields and woods that had been my ancestors ' and were now mine ."
"By good luck , his knife flew out of his hand as he fell ."
"I picked up both that and his brogues , wished him a good morning , and set off upon my way , leaving him barefoot and disarmed ."
"I chuckled to myself as I went , being sure I was done with that rogue , for a variety of reasons ."
"First , he knew he could have no more of my money ; next , the brogues were worth in that country only a few pence ; and , lastly , the knife , which was really a dagger , it was against the law for him to carry ."
"In about half an hour of walk , I overtook a great , ragged man , moving pretty fast but feeling before him with a staff ."
"He was quite blind , and told me he was a catechist , which should have put me at my ease ."
"But his face went against me ; it seemed dark and dangerous and secret ; and presently , as we began to go on alongside , I saw the steel butt of a pistol sticking from under the flap of his coat-pocket ."
"To carry such a thing meant a fine of fifteen pounds sterling upon a first offence , and transportation to the colonies upon a second ."
"Nor could I quite see why a religious teacher should go armed , or what a blind man could be doing with a pistol ."
"I told him about my guide , for I was proud of what I had done , and my vanity for once got the heels of my prudence ."
"At the mention of the five shillings he cried out so loud that I made up my mind I should say nothing of the other two , and was glad he could not see my blushes ."
`` Was it too much ? ''
"I asked , a little faltering ."
`` Too much ! ''
cries he .
"`` Why , I will guide you to Torosay myself for a dram of brandy ."
And give you the great pleasure of my company -LRB- me that is a man of some learning -RRB- in the bargain . ''
"I said I did not see how a blind man could be a guide ; but at that he laughed aloud , and said his stick was eyes enough for an eagle ."
"`` In the Isle of Mull , at least , '' says he , `` where I know every stone and heather-bush by mark of head ."
"See , now , '' he said , striking right and left , as if to make sure , `` down there a burn is running ; and at the head of it there stands a bit of a small hill with a stone cocked upon the top of that ; and it 's hard at the foot of the hill , that the way runs by to Torosay ; and the way here , being for droves , is plainly trodden , and will show grassy through the heather . ''"
"I had to own he was right in every feature , and told my wonder ."
`` Ha ! ''
"says he , `` that 's nothing ."
"Would ye believe me now , that before the Act came out , and when there were weepons in this country , I could shoot ?"
"Ay , could I ! ''"
"cries he , and then with a leer : `` If ye had such a thing as a pistol here to try with , I would show ye how it 's done . ''"
"I told him I had nothing of the sort , and gave him a wider berth ."
"If he had known , his pistol stuck at that time quite plainly out of his pocket , and I could see the sun twinkle on the steel of the butt ."
"But by the better luck for me , he knew nothing , thought all was covered , and lied on in the dark ."
"He then began to question me cunningly , where I came from , whether I was rich , whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him -LRB- which he declared he had that moment in his sporran -RRB- , and all the time he kept edging up to me and I avoiding him ."
"We were now upon a sort of green cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay , and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel ."
"I had so plainly the upper-hand that my spirits rose , and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of blindman 's buff ; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier , and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff ."
But we must take a brace and see it through . ''
All Rilla 's anger against Susan had evaporated .
"With Ken 's kiss still burning on her lips , and the wonderful significance of the promise he had asked thrilling heart and soul , she could not be angry with anyone ."
"She put her slim white hand into Susan 's brown , work-hardened one and gave it a squeeze ."
Susan was a faithful old dear and would lay down her life for any one of them .
"`` You are tired , Rilla dear , and had better go to bed , '' Susan said , patting her hand ."
`` I noticed you were too tired to talk tonight .
I am glad I came home in time to help you out .
It is very tiresome trying to entertain young men when you are not accustomed to it . ''
"Rilla carried Jims upstairs and went to bed , but not before she had sat for a long time at her window reconstructing her rainbow castle , with several added domes and turrets ."
"`` I wonder , '' she said to herself , `` if I am , or am not , engaged to Kenneth Ford . ''"
"CHAPTER XVII THE WEEKS WEAR BY Rilla read her first love letter in her Rainbow Valley fir-shadowed nook , and a girl 's first love letter , whatever blase , older people may think of it , is an event of tremendous importance in the teens ."
"After Kenneth 's regiment had left Kingsport there came a fortnight of dully-aching anxiety and when the congregation sang in Church on Sunday evenings , `` Oh , hear us when we cry to Thee For those in peril on the sea , '' Rilla 's voice always failed her ; for with the words came a horribly vivid mind picture of a submarined ship sinking beneath pitiless waves amid the struggles and cries of drowning men ."
"Then word came that Kenneth 's regiment had arrived safely in England ; and now , at last , here was his letter ."
It began with something that made Rilla supremely happy for the moment and ended with a paragraph that crimsoned her cheeks with the wonder and thrill and delight of it .
"Between beginning and ending the letter was just such a jolly , newsy epistle as Ken might have written to anyone ; but for the sake of that beginning and ending Rilla slept with the letter under her pillow for weeks , sometimes waking in the night to slip her fingers under and just touch it , and looked with secret pity on other girls whose sweethearts could never have written them anything half so wonderful and exquisite ."
Kenneth was not the son of a famous novelist for nothing .
"He `` had a way '' of expressing things in a few poignant , significant words that seemed to suggest far more than they uttered , and never grew stale or flat or foolish with ever so many scores of readings ."
Rilla went home from Rainbow Valley as if she flew rather than walked .
But such moments of uplift were rare that autumn .
"To be sure , there was one day in September when great news came of a big Allied victory in the west and Susan ran out to hoist the flag -- the first time she had hoisted it since the Russian line broke and the last time she was to hoist it for many dismal moons ."
"`` Likely the Big Push has begun at last , Mrs. Dr. dear , '' she exclaimed , `` and we will soon see the finish of the Huns ."
Our boys will be home by Christmas now .
Hurrah ! ''
"Susan was ashamed of herself for hurrahing the minute she had done it , and apologized meekly for such an outburst of juvenility ."
"`` But indeed , Mrs. Dr. dear , this good news has gone to my head after this awful summer of Russian slumps and Gallipoli setbacks . ''"
`` Good news ! ''
said Miss Oliver bitterly .
`` I wonder if the women whose men have been killed for it will call it good news .
Just because our own men are not on that part of the front we are rejoicing as if the victory had cost no lives . ''
"`` Now , Miss Oliver dear , do not take that view of it , '' deprecated Susan ."
`` We have not had much to rejoice over of late and yet men were being killed just the same .
"It certainly was a pleasant place , airy , clean , and bright ."
"A hop-vine shook its green bells round the open window , the pretty aquarium stood in the middle of the room , with some delicate water plants rising above the water , and gold-fish showing their brightness as they floated to and fro below ."
On either side of the window were rows of shelves ready to receive the curiosities yet to be found .
"Dan 's tall cabinet stood before the great door which was fastened up , while the small door was to be used ."
"On the cabinet stood a queer Indian idol , very ugly , but very interesting ; old Mr. Laurence sent it , as well as a fine Chinese junk in full sail , which had a conspicuous place on the long table in the middle of the room ."
"Above , swinging in a loop , and looking as if she was alive , hung Polly , who died at an advanced age , had been carefully stuffed , and was no presented by Mrs. Jo ."
The walls were decorated with all sorts of things .
"A snake 's skin , a big wasp 's nest , a birch-bark canoe , a string of birds ' eggs , wreaths of gray moss from the South , and a bunch of cotton-pods ."
"The dead bats had a place , also a large turtle-shell , and an ostrich-egg proudly presented by Demi , who volunteered to explain these rare curiosities to guests whenever they liked ."
"There were so many stones that it was impossible to accept them all , so only a few of the best were arranged among the shells on the shelves , the rest were piled up in corners , to be examined by Dan at his leisure ."
"Every one was eager to give something , even Silas , who sent home for a stuffed wild-cat killed in his youth ."
"It was rather moth-eaten and shabby , but on a high bracket and best side foremost the effect was fine , for the yellow glass eyes glared , and the mouth snarled so naturally , that Teddy shook in his little shoes at sight of it , when he came bringing his most cherished treasure , one cocoon , to lay upon the shrine of science ."
`` Is n't it beautiful ?
I 'd no idea we had so many curious things .
I gave that ; do n't it look well ?
We might make a lot by charging something for letting folks see it . ''
Jack added that last suggestion to the general chatter that went on as the family viewed the room .
"`` This is a free museum and if there is any speculating on it I 'll paint out the name over the door , '' said Mr. Laurie , turning so quickly that Jack wished he had held his tongue ."
`` Hear !
hear ! ''
cried Mr. Bhaer .
`` Speech !
speech ! ''
added Mrs. Jo .
"`` Ca n't , I 'm too bashful ."
"You give them a lecture yourself you are used to it , '' Mr. Laurie answered , retreating towards the window , meaning to escape ."
"But she held him fast , and said , laughing as she looked at the dozen pairs of dirty hands about her , `` If I did lecture , it would on the chemical and cleansing properties of soap ."
"Come now , as the founder of the institution , you really ought to give us a few moral remarks , and we will applaud tremendously . ''"
"Seeing that there was no way of escaping , Mr. Laurie looked up at Polly hanging overhead , seemed to find inspiration in the brilliant old bird , and sitting down upon the table , said , in his pleasant way , `` There is one thing I 'd like to suggest , boys , and that is , I want you to get some good as well as much pleasure out of this ."
"Just putting curious or pretty things here wo n't do it ; so suppose you read up about them , so that when anybody asks questions you can answer them , and understand the matter ."
"I used to like these things myself , and should enjoy hearing about them now , for I 've forgotten all I once knew ."
"It was n't much , was it , Jo ?"
Sidney liked the letter and answered it .
Since then they had written to each other regularly .
"There was nothing sentimental , hinted at or implied , in the correspondence ."
"Whatever the faults of Sidney 's romantic visions were , they did not tend to precocious flirtation ."
"The Plainfield boys , attracted by her beauty and repelled by her indifference and aloofness , could have told that ."
"She never expected to meet John Lincoln , nor did she wish to do so ."
In the correspondence itself she found her pleasure .
"John Lincoln wrote breezy accounts of ranch life and adventures on the far western plains , so alien and remote from snug , humdrum Plainfield life that Sidney always had the sensation of crossing a gulf when she opened a letter from the Bar N ."
"As for Sidney 's own letter , this is the way it read as she wrote it : `` The Evergreens , '' Plainfield ."
Dear Mr. Lincoln : The very best letter I can write in the half-hour before the carriage will be at the door to take me to Mrs. Braddon 's dance shall be yours tonight .
"I am sitting here in the library arrayed in my smartest , newest , whitest , silkiest gown , with a string of pearls which Uncle James gave me today about my throat -- the dear , glistening , sheeny things !"
And I am looking forward to the `` dances and delight '' of the evening with keen anticipation .
You asked me in your last letter if I did not sometimes grow weary of my endless round of dances and dinners and social functions .
"No , no , never !"
"I enjoy every one of them , every minute of them ."
"I love life and its bloom and brilliancy ; I love meeting new people ; I love the ripple of music , the hum of laughter and conversation ."
Every morning when I awaken the new day seems to me to be a good fairy who will bring me some beautiful gift of joy .
The gift she gave me today was my sunset gallop on my grey mare Lady .
The thrill of it is in my veins yet .
"I distanced the others who rode with me and led the homeward canter alone , rocking along a dark , gleaming road , shadowy with tall firs and pines , whose balsam made all the air resinous around me ."
"Before me was a long valley filled with purple dusk , and beyond it meadows of sunset and great lakes of saffron and rose where a soul might lose itself in colour ."
"On my right was the harbour , silvered over with a rising moon ."
"Oh , it was all glorious -- the clear air with its salt-sea tang , the aroma of the pines , the laughter of my friends behind me , the spring and rhythm of Lady 's grey satin body beneath me !"
"I wanted to ride on so forever , straight into the heart of the sunset ."
Then home and to dinner .
"We have a houseful of guests at present -- one of them an old statesman with a massive silver head , and eyes that have looked into people 's thoughts so long that you have an uncanny feeling that they can see right through your soul and read motives you dare not avow even to yourself ."
"I was terribly in awe of him at first , but when I got acquainted with him I found him charming ."
He is not above talking delightful nonsense even to a girl .
"I sat by him at dinner , and he talked to me -- not nonsense , either , this time ."
He told me of his political contests and diplomatic battles ; he was wise and witty and whimsical .
"I felt as if I were drinking some rare , stimulating mental wine ."
What a privilege it is to meet such men and take a peep through their wise eyes at the fascinating game of empire-building !
"Jill had been winding wool for a stripe in her new afghan , and the green ball lay on her sofa ."
"These signs suggested and confirmed what Mrs. Minot did not want to believe ; so did the voice , attitude , and air of Jill , all very unlike her usual open , alert ways ."
"The kind lady could easily forgive the reading of her letter since the girl had found such sad news there , but the dangers of disobedience were serious in her case , and a glance showed that she was suffering either in mind or body -- perhaps both ."
`` I will wait for her to tell me .
"She is an honest child , and the truth will soon come out , '' thought Mrs. Minot , as she took a clean sheet , and Jill tried to study ."
"`` Shall I hear your lesson , dear ?"
"Jack means to recite his like a good boy , so suppose you follow his example , '' she said , presently ."
"`` I do n't know as I can say it , but I 'll try . ''"
"Jill did try , and got on bravely till she came to the word `` permanent ; '' there she hesitated , remembering where she saw it last ."
`` Do you know what that means ? ''
"asked her teacher , thinking to help her on by defining the word ."
`` Always -- for a great while -- or something like that ; does n't it ? ''
"faltered Jill , with a tight feeling in her throat , and the color coming up , as she tried to speak easily , yet felt so shame-stricken she could not ."
"`` Are you in pain , my child ?"
"Never mind the lesson ; tell me , and I 'll do something for you . ''"
"The kind words , the soft hand on her hot cheek , and the pity in the eyes that looked at her , were too much for Jill ."
"A sob came first , and then the truth , told with hidden face and tears that washed the blush away , and set free the honest little soul that could not hide its fault from such a friend ."
"`` I knew it all before , and was sure you would tell me , else you would not be the child I love and like to help so well . ''"
"Then , while she soothed Jill 's trouble , Mrs. Minot told her story and showed the letter , wishing to lessen , if possible , some part of the pain it had given ."
`` Sly old stamp !
"To go and tell on me when I meant to own up , and get some credit if I could , after being so mean and bad , '' said Jill , smiling through her tears when she saw the tell-tale witnesses against her ."
"`` You had better stick it in your book to remind you of the bad consequences of disobedience , then perhaps this lesson will leave a ` permanent ' impression on your mind and memory , '' answered Mrs. Minot , glad to see her natural gayety coming back , and hoping that she had forgotten the contents of the unfortunate letter ."
"But she had not ; and presently , when the sad affair had been talked over and forgiven , Jill asked , slowly , as she tried to put on a brave look , -- `` Please tell me about Lucinda Snow ."
"If I am to be like her , I might as well know how she managed to bear it so long . ''"
"`` I 'm sorry you ever heard of her , and yet perhaps it may help you to bear your trial , dear , which I hope will never be as heavy a one as hers ."
"This Lucinda I knew for years , and though at first I thought her fate the saddest that could be , I came at last to see how happy she was in spite of her affliction , how good and useful and beloved . ''"
"`` Why , how could she be ?"
What did she do ? ''
"cried Jill , forgetting her own troubles to look up with an open , eager face again ."
"`` She was so patient , other people were ashamed to complain of their small worries ; so cheerful , that her own great one grew lighter ; so industrious , that she made both money and friends by pretty things she worked and sold to her many visitors ."
"And , best of all , so wise and sweet that she seemed to get good out of everything , and make her poor room a sort of chapel where people went for comfort , counsel , and an example of a pious life ."
"So , you see , Lucinda was not so very miserable after all . ''"
After that he lay down and slept soundly .
"The sun was shining when he awoke , and he jumped up and ran to the pot ."
"The plant had disappeared and in its stead was a thick syrup , just as the book had said there would be ."
"He lifted the syrup out with a spoon , and after spreading it in the sun till it was partly dry , poured it into a small flask of crystal ."
"He next washed himself thoroughly , and dressed himself , in his best clothes , and putting the flask in his pocket , set out for the palace , and begged to see the king without delay ."
"Now Balancin , whose foot had been much less painful since Gilguerillo had wrapped it in the plaster , was counting the days to the young man 's return ; and when he was told Gilguerillo was there , ordered him to be admitted at once ."
"As he entered , the king raised himself eagerly on his pillows , but his face fell when he saw no signs of a slipper ."
"` You have failed , then ? '"
"he said , throwing up his hands in despair . '"
"I hope not , your majesty ; I think not , ' answered the youth ."
"And drawing the flask from his pocket , he poured two or three drops on the wound ."
"` Repeat this for three nights , and you will find yourself cured , ' said he ."
And before the king had time to thank him he had bowed himself out .
"Of course the news soon spread through the city , and men and women never tired of calling Gilguerillo an impostor , and prophesying that the end of the three days would see him in prison , if not on the scaffold ."
"But Gilguerillo paid no heed to their hard words , and no more did the king , who took care that no hand but his own should put on the healing balsam ."
On the fourth morning the king awoke and instantly stretched out his wounded foot that he might prove the truth or falsehood of Gilguerillo 's remedy .
"The wound was certainly cured on that side , but how about the other ?"
"Yes , that was cured also ; and not even a scar was left to show where it had been !"
Was ever any king so happy as Balancin when he satisfied himself of this ?
"Lightly as a deer he jumped from his bed , and began to turn head over heels and to perform all sorts of antics , so as to make sure that his foot was in truth as well as it looked ."
"And when he was quite tired he sent for his daughter , and bade the courtiers bring the lucky young man to his room ."
"` He is really young and handsome , ' said the princess to herself , heaving a sigh of relief that it was not some dreadful old man who had healed her father ; and while the king was announcing to his courtiers the wonderful cure that had been made , Diamantina was thinking that if Gilguerillo looked so well in his common dress , how much improved by the splendid garments of a king ' son ."
"However , she held her peace , and only watched with amusement when the courtiers , knowing there was no help for it , did homage and obeisance to the chemist 's boy ."
"Then they brought to Gilguerillo a magnificent tunic of green velvet bordered with gold , and a cap with three white plumes stuck in it ; and at the sight of him so arrayed , the princess fell in love with him in a moment ."
"The wedding was fixed to take place in eight days , and at the ball afterwards nobody danced so long or so lightly as king Balancin ."
"The Magic Book -LSB- From Capullos de Rosa , por D. Enrique Ceballos Quintana . -RSB-"
-LSB- From AEventyr fra Zylland samlede og optegnede af Tang Kristensen .
Translated from the Danish by Mrs. Skavgaard-Pedersen . -RSB-
There was once an old couple named Peder and Kirsten who had an only son called Hans .
From the time he was a little boy he had been told that on his sixteenth birthday he must go out into the world and serve his apprenticeship .
"So , one fine summer morning , he started off to seek his fortune with nothing but the clothes he wore on his back ."
"For many hours he trudged on merrily , now and then stopping to drink from some clear spring or to pick some ripe fruit from a tree ."
"The other boys were flying around him now , flouting , scornful ; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently , his mind was no longer with them ; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago , or being sent up -LSB- to the headmaster -RSB- for good , or watching the wall-game from a famous wall ."
"And his shoes were right , and his waistcoat was right , and his tie was right , and his socks were right ."
"James Hook , thou not wholly unheroic figure , farewell ."
For we have come to his last moment .
"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised , he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea ."
He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him ; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him : a little mark of respect from us at the end .
"He had one last triumph , which I think we need not grudge him ."
"As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air , he invited him with a gesture to use his foot ."
It made Peter kick instead of stab .
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved .
"`` Bad form , '' he cried jeeringly , and went content to the crocodile ."
Thus perished James Hook .
"`` Seventeen , '' Slightly sang out ; but he was not quite correct in his figures ."
"Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night ; but two reached the shore : Starkey to be captured by the redskins , who made him nurse for all their papooses , a melancholy come-down for a pirate ; and Smee , who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles , making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas ."
Hook had feared .
"Wendy , of course , had stood by taking no part in the fight , though watching Peter with glistening eyes ; but now that all was over she became prominent again ."
"She praised them equally , and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one ; and then she took them into Hook 's cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail ."
It said `` half-past one ! ''
The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all .
"She got them to bed in the pirates ' bunks pretty quickly , you may be sure ; all but Peter , who strutted up and down on the deck , until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom ."
"He had one of his dreams that night , and cried in his sleep for a long time , and Wendy held him tightly ."
"Chapter 16 THE RETURN HOME By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps -LSB- legs -RSB- ; for there was a big sea running ; and Tootles , the bo ` sun , was among them , with a rope 's end in his hand and chewing tobacco ."
"They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee , shaved smartly , and tumbled up , with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers ."
It need not be said who was the captain .
Nibs and John were first and second mate .
There was a woman aboard .
"The rest were tars -LSB- sailors -RSB- before the mast , and lived in the fo ` c ` sle ."
"Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel ; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them ; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties , but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast , and if they snapped at him he would tear them ."
"The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood , and they cheered him lustily ."
"Then a few sharp orders were given , and they turned the ship round , and nosed her for the mainland ."
"Captain Pan calculated , after consulting the ship 's chart , that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June , after which it would save time to fly ."
"Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate ; but the captain treated them as dogs , and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin -LSB- one person after another , as they had to Cpt ."
` Then I sha n't be exactly a human ? '
Peter asked .
` No . '
` Nor exactly a bird ? '
` No . '
` What shall I be ? '
"` You will be a Betwixt-and-Between , ' Solomon said , and certainly he was a wise old fellow , for that is exactly how it turned out ."
The birds on the island never got used to him .
"His oddities tickled them every day , as if they were quite new , though it was really the birds that were new ."
"They came out of the eggs daily , and laughed at him at once ; then off they soon flew to be humans , and other birds came out of other eggs ; and so it went on for ever ."
"The crafty mother-birds , when they tired of sitting on their eggs , used to get the young ones to break their shells a day before the right time by whispering to them that now was their chance to see Peter washing or drinking or eating ."
"Thousands gathered round him daily to watch him do these things , just as you watch the peacocks , and they screamed with delight when he lifted the crusts they flung him with his hands instead of in the usual way with the mouth ."
All his food was brought to him from the Gardens at Solomon 's orders by the birds .
"He would not eat worms or insects -LRB- which they thought very silly of him -RRB- , so they brought him bread in their beaks ."
"Thus , when you cry out , ` Greedy !"
Greedy ! '
"to the bird that flies away with the big crust , you know now that you ought not to do this , for he is very likely taking it to Peter Pan ."
-LSB- Illustration : The birds on the island never got used to him .
His oddities tickled them every day -RSB- Peter wore no nightgown now .
"You see , the birds were always begging him for bits of it to line their nests with , and , being very good-natured , he could not refuse , so by Solomon 's advice he had hidden what was left of it ."
"But , though he was now quite naked , you must not think that he was cold or unhappy ."
"He was usually very happy and gay , and the reason was that Solomon had kept his promise and taught him many of the bird ways ."
"To be easily pleased , for instance , and always to be really doing something , and to think that whatever he was doing was a thing of vast importance ."
"Peter became very clever at helping the birds to build their nests ; soon he could build better than a wood-pigeon , and nearly as well as a blackbird , though never did he satisfy the finches , and he made nice little water-troughs near the nests and dug up worms for the young ones with his fingers ."
"He also became very learned in bird-lore , and knew an east wind from a west wind by its smell , and he could see the grass growing and hear the insects walking about inside the tree-trunks ."
But the best thing Solomon had done was to teach him to have a glad heart .
"All birds have glad hearts unless you rob their nests , and so , as they were the only kind of heart Solomon knew about , it was easy to him to teach Peter how to have one ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times -RSB- Peter 's heart was so glad that he felt he must sing all day long , just as the birds sing for joy , but , being partly human , he needed an instrument , so he made a pipe of reeds , and he used to sit by the shore of the island of an evening , practising the sough of the wind and the ripple of the water , and catching handfuls of the shine of the moon , and he put them all in his pipe and played them so beautifully that even the birds were deceived , and they would say to each other , ` Was that a fish leaping in the water or was it Peter playing leaping fish on his pipe ? '"
"And sometimes he played the birth of birds , and then the mothers would turn round in their nests to see whether they had laid an egg ."
"If you are a child of the Gardens you must know the chestnut-tree near the bridge , which comes out in flower first of all the chestnuts , but perhaps you have not heard why this tree leads the way ."
"It is because Peter wearies for summer and plays that it has come , and the chestnut being so near , hears him and is cheated ."
"That is all we are , lookers-on ."
Nobody really wants us .
"So let us watch and say jaggy things , in the hope that some of them will hurt ."
The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and six the kennel is no longer there .
"When the children flew away , Mr. Darling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up , and that from first to last she had been wiser than he ."
"Of course , as we have seen , he was quite a simple man ; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off ; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion 's courage to do what seemed right to him ; and having thought the matter out with anxious care after the flight of the children , he went down on all fours and crawled into the kennel ."
"To all Mrs. Darling 's dear invitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly : `` No , my own one , this is the place for me . ''"
In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kennel until his children came back .
"Of course this was a pity ; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess , otherwise he soon gave up doing it ."
"And there never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling , as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and all their pretty ways ."
Very touching was his deference to Nana .
"He would not let her come into the kennel , but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly ."
"Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab , which conveyed him to his office , and he returned home in the same way at six ."
Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours : this man whose every movement now attracted surprised attention .
"Inwardly he must have suffered torture ; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised his little home , and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who looked inside ."
"It may have been Quixotic , but it was magnificent ."
"Soon the inward meaning of it leaked out , and the great heart of the public was touched ."
"Crowds followed the cab , cheering it lustily ; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph ; interviews appeared in the better class of papers , and society invited him to dinner and added , `` Do come in the kennel . ''"
"On that eventful Thursday week , Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaiting George 's return home ; a very sad-eyed woman ."
"Now that we look at her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days , all gone now just because she has lost her babes , I find I wo n't be able to say nasty things about her after all ."
"If she was too fond of her rubbishy children , she could n't help it ."
"Look at her in her chair , where she has fallen asleep ."
"The corner of her mouth , where one looks first , is almost withered up ."
Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there .
"Some like Peter best , and some like Wendy best , but I like her best ."
"Suppose , to make her happy , we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back ."
"They are really within two miles of the window now , and flying strong , but all we need whisper is that they are on the way ."
Let 's .
"It is a pity we did it , for she has started up , calling their names ; and there is no one in the room but Nana ."
"`` O Nana , I dreamt my dear ones had come back . ''"
"Nana had filmy eyes , but all she could do was put her paw gently on her mistress 's lap ; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was brought back ."
"As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife , we see that his face is more worn than of yore , but has a softer expression ."
"A glance showed that it was not the composition nor a note , but the beginning of a letter from Mrs. Minot to her sister , and Jill was about to lay it down when her own name caught her eye , and she could not resist reading it ."
"Hard words to write of one so young , doubly hard to read , and impossible to forget ."
"`` Dear Lizzie , -- Jack continues to do very well , and will soon be up again ."
But we begin to fear that the little girl is permanently injured in the back .
"She is here , and we do our best for her ; but I never look at her without thinking of Lucinda Snow , who , you remember , was bedridden for twenty years , owing to a fall at fifteen ."
"Poor little Janey does not know yet , and I hope '' -- There it ended , and `` poor little Janey 's '' punishment for disobedience began that instant ."
"She thought she was getting well because she did not suffer all the time , and every one spoke cheerfully about `` by and by . ''"
"Now she knew the truth , and shut her eyes with a shiver as she said , low , to herself , -- `` Twenty years !"
"I could n't bear it ; oh , I could n't bear it ! ''"
"A very miserable Jill lay on the floor , and for a while did not care who came and found her ; then the last words of the letter -- `` I hope '' -- seemed to shine across the blackness of the dreadful `` twenty years '' and cheer her up a bit , for despair never lives long in young hearts , and Jill was a brave child ."
"`` That is why Mammy sighs so when she dresses me , and every one is so good to me ."
"Perhaps Mrs. Minot does n't really know , after all ."
"She was dreadfully scared about Jack , and he is getting well ."
"I 'd like to ask Doctor , but he might find out about the letter ."
"Oh , dear , why did n't I keep still and let the horrid thing alone ! ''"
"As she thought that , Jill pushed the paper away , pulled herself up , and with much painful effort managed to get back to her sofa , where she laid herself down with a groan , feeling as if the twenty years had already passed over her since she tumbled off ."
"`` I 've told a lie , for I said I would n't stir ."
"I 've hurt my back , I 've done a mean thing , and I 've got paid for it ."
"A nice missionary I am ; I 'd better begin at home , as Mammy told me to ; '' and Jill groaned again , remembering her mother 's words ."
"`` Now I 've got another secret to keep all alone , for I 'd be ashamed to tell the girls ."
I guess I 'll turn round and study my spelling ; then no one will see my face . ''
"Jill looked the picture of a good , industrious child as she lay with her back to the large table , her book held so that nothing was to be seen but one cheek and a pair of lips moving busily ."
"Fortunately , it is difficult for little sinners to act a part , and , even if the face is hidden , something in the body seems to betray the internal remorse and shame ."
"Usually , Jill lay flat and still ; now her back was bent in a peculiar way as she leaned over her book , and one foot wagged nervously , while on the visible cheek was a Spanish stamp with a woman 's face looking through the black bars , very suggestively , if she had known it ."
"How long the minutes seemed till some one came , and what a queer little jump her heart gave when Mrs. Minot 's voice said , cheerfully , `` Jack is all right , and , I declare , so is Jill ."
"I really believe there is a telegraph still working somewhere between you two , and each knows what the other is about without words . ''"
"`` I did n't have any other book handy , so I thought I 'd study awhile , '' answered Jill , feeling that she deserved no praise for her seeming industry ."
"She cast a sidelong glance as she spoke , and seeing that Mrs. Minot was looking for the letter , hid her face and lay so still she could hear the rustle of the paper as it was taken from the floor ."
"It was well she did not also see the quick look the lady gave her as she turned the letter and found a red stamp sticking to the under side , for this unlucky little witness told the story ."
"Mrs. Minot remembered having seen the stamp lying close to the sofa when she left the room , for she had had half a mind to take it to Jack , but did not , thinking Frank 's plan had some advantages ."
"She also recollected that a paper flew off the table , but being in haste she had not stopped to see what it was ."
"Now , the stamp and the letter could hardly have come together without hands , for they lay a yard apart , and here , also , on the unwritten portion of the page , was the mark of a small green thumb ."
`` Tarry we no more . ''
"In the chancel they found Dick waiting , attended by a few young men ; and there were he and Joan united ."
"When they came forth again , happy and yet serious , into the frosty air and sunlight , the long files of the army were already winding forward up the road ; already the Duke of Gloucester 's banner was unfolded and began to move from before the abbey in a clump of spears ; and behind it , girt by steel-clad knights , the bold , black-hearted , and ambitious hunchback moved on towards his brief kingdom and his lasting infamy ."
"But the wedding party turned upon the other side , and sat down , with sober merriment , to breakfast ."
"The father cellarer attended on their wants , and sat with them at table ."
"Hamley , all jealousy forgotten , began to ply the nowise loth Alicia with courtship ."
"And there , amid the sounding of tuckets and the clash of armoured soldiery and horses continually moving forth , Dick and Joan sat side by side , tenderly held hands , and looked , with ever growing affection , in each other 's eyes ."
Thenceforth the dust and blood of that unruly epoch passed them by .
They dwelt apart from alarms in the green forest where their love began .
"Two old men in the meanwhile enjoyed pensions in great prosperity and peace , and with perhaps a superfluity of ale and wine , in Tunstall hamlet ."
"One had been all his life a shipman , and continued to the last to lament his man Tom ."
"The other , who had been a bit of everything , turned in the end towards piety , and made a most religious death under the name of Brother Honestus in the neighbouring abbey ."
"So Lawless had his will , and died a friar ."
"Footnotes : -LCB- 1 -RCB- At the date of this story , Richard Crookback could not have been created Duke of Gloucester ; but for clearness , with the reader 's leave , he shall so be called ."

_BOOK_TITLE_ : Robert_Louis_Stevenson___Treasure_Island.txt.out
"PART ONE -- The Old Buccaneer 1 The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow SQUIRE TRELAWNEY , Dr. Livesey , and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island , from the beginning to the end , keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island , and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted , I take up my pen in the year of grace 17 __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof ."
"I remember him as if it were yesterday , as he came plodding to the inn door , his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow -- a tall , strong , heavy , nut-brown man , his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat , his hands ragged and scarred , with black , broken nails , and the sabre cut across one cheek , a dirty , livid white ."
"I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so , and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards : `` Fifteen men on the dead man 's chest -- Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! ''"
"in the high , old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars ."
"Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried , and when my father appeared , called roughly for a glass of rum ."
"This , when it was brought to him , he drank slowly , like a connoisseur , lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard ."
"`` This is a handy cove , '' says he at length ; `` and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop ."
"Much company , mate ? ''"
"My father told him no , very little company , the more was the pity ."
"`` Well , then , '' said he , `` this is the berth for me ."
"Here you , matey , '' he cried to the man who trundled the barrow ; `` bring up alongside and help up my chest ."
"I 'll stay here a bit , '' he continued ."
"`` I 'm a plain man ; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want , and that head up there for to watch ships off ."
What you mought call me ?
You mought call me captain .
"Oh , I see what you 're at -- there '' ; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold ."
"` Oh , heaven , help me ! '"
cried he .
` Cross !
cross ! '
answered a voice .
"The boy leapt for joy as he recognised the note of the owl of which the swallow had spoken , and he said softly in the bird 's language : ` Oh , wise owl , I pray you to protect and guide me , for I have come in search of the Bird of Truth ."
And first I must fill this far with the many-coloured water in the courtyard of the castle . '
"` Do not do that , ' answered the owl , ` but fill the jar from the spring which bubbles close by the fountain with the many-coloured water ."
"Afterwards , go into the aviary opposite the great door , but be careful not to touch any of the bright-plumaged birds contained in it , which will cry to you , each one , that he is the Bird of Truth ."
"Choose only a small white bird that is hidden in a corner , which the others try incessantly to kill , not knowing that it can not die ."
"And , be quick !"
"-- for at this very moment the giant has fallen asleep , and you have only a quarter of an hour to do everything . '"
"The boy ran as fast as he could and entered the courtyard , where he saw the two spring close together ."
"He passed by the many-coloured water without casting a glance at it , and filled the jar from the fountain whose water was clear and pure ."
"He next hastened to the aviary , and was almost deafened by the clamour that rose as he shut the door behind him ."
"Voices of peacocks , voices of ravens , voices of magpies , each claiming to be the Bird of Truth ."
"With steadfast face the boy walked by them all , to the corner , where , hemmed in by a hand of fierce crows , was the small white bird he sought ."
"Putting her safely in his breast , he passed out , followed by the screams of the birds of Bad Faith which he left behind him ."
"Once outside , he ran without stopping to the witch 's tower , and handed to the old woman the jar she had given him ."
` Become a parrot ! '
"cried she , flinging the water over him ."
"But instead of losing his shape , as so many had done before , he only grew ten times handsomer ; for the water was enchanted for good and not ill ."
"Then the creeping multitude around the witch hastened to roll themselves in the water , and stood up , human beings again ."
"When the witch saw what was happening , she took a broomstick and flew away ."
"Who can guess the delight of the sister at the sight of her brother , bearing the Bird of Truth ?"
"But although the boy had accomplished much , something very difficult yet remained , and that was how to carry the Bird of Truth to the king without her being seized by the wicked courtiers , who would be ruined by the discovery of their plot ."
"Soon -- no one knew how -- the news spread abroad that the Bird of Truth was hovering round the palace , and the courtiers made all sorts of preparations to hinder her reaching the king ."
"They got ready weapons that were sharpened , and weapons that were poisoned ; they sent for eagles and falcons to hunt her down , and constructed cages and boxes in which to shut her up if they were not able to kill her ."
They declared that her white plumage was really put on to hide her black feathers -- in fact there was nothing they did not do in order to prevent the king from seeing the bird or from paying attention to her words if he did .
"As often happens in these cases , the courtiers brought about that which they feared ."
"They talked so much about the Bird of Truth that at last the king heard of it , and expressed a wish to see her ."
"The more difficulties that were put in his way the stronger grew his desire , and in the end the king published a proclamation that whoever found the Bird of Truth should bring her to him without delay ."
"The one thing she was sure of was that she must never cease to run , and she thought she was still running long after she had dropped in the Figs and gone to sleep ."
She thought the snowflakes falling on her face were her mother kissing her good-night .
"She thought her coverlet of snow was a warm blanket , and tried to pull it over her head ."
And when she heard talking through her dreams she thought it was mother bringing father to the nursery door to look at her as she slept .
But it was the fairies .
I am very glad to be able to say that they no longer desired to mischief her .
When she rushed away they had rent the air with such cries as ` Slay her ! '
` Turn her into something extremely unpleasant ! '
"and so on , but the pursuit was delayed while they discussed who should march in front , and this gave Duchess Brownie time to cast herself before the Queen and demand a boon ."
"Every bride has a right to a boon , and what she asked for was Maimie 's life ."
"` Anything except that , ' replied Queen Mab sternly , and all the fairies echoed , ` Anything except that . '"
"But when they learned how Maimie had befriended Brownie and so enabled her to attend the ball to their great glory and renown , they gave three huzzas for the little human , and set off , like an army , to thank her , the court advancing in front and the canopy keeping step with it ."
They traced Maimie easily by her footprints in the snow .
"But though they found her deep in snow in the Figs , it seemed impossible to thank Maimie , for they could not waken her ."
"They went through the form of thanking her -- that is to say , the new King stood on her body and read her a long address of welcome , but she heard not a word of it ."
"They also cleared the snow off her , but soon she was covered again , and they saw she was in danger of perishing of cold ."
"` Turn her into something that does not mind the cold , ' seemed a good suggestion of the doctor 's , but the only thing they could think of that does not mind cold was a snowflake ."
"` And it might melt , ' the Queen pointed out , so that idea had to be given up ."
"A magnificent attempt was made to carry her to a sheltered spot , but though there were so many of them she was too heavy ."
"By this time all the ladies were crying in their handkerchiefs , but presently the Cupids had a lovely idea ."
"` Build a house round her , ' they cried , and at once everybody perceived that this was the thing to do ; in a moment a hundred fairy sawyers were among the branches , architects were running round Maimie , measuring her ; a bricklayer 's yard sprang up at her feet , seventy-five masons rushed up with the foundation-stone , and the Queen laid it , overseers were appointed to keep the boys off , scaffoldings were run up , the whole place rang with hammers and chisels and turning-lathes , and by this time the roof was on and the glaziers were putting in the windows ."
"-LSB- Illustration : Queen Mab , who rules in the Gardens -RSB- The house was exactly the size of Maimie , and perfectly lovely ."
"One of her arms was extended , and this had bothered them for a second , but they built a verandah round it leading to the front door ."
"The windows were the size of a coloured picture-book and the door rather smaller , but it would be easy for her to get out by taking off the roof ."
"The fairies , as is their custom , clapped their hands with delight over their cleverness , and they were so madly in love with the little house that they could not bear to think they had finished it ."
"So they gave it ever so many little extra touches , and even then they added more extra touches ."
"For instance , two of them ran up a ladder and put on a chimney ."
"` Now we fear it is quite finished , ' they sighed ."
"But no , for another two ran up the ladder , and tied some smoke to the chimney ."
"` That certainly finishes it , ' they said reluctantly ."
"` Not at all , ' cried a glow-worm ; ` if she were to wake without seeing a night-light she might be frightened , so I shall be her night-light . '"
"` Wait one moment , ' said a china merchant , ` and I shall make you a saucer . '"
"Merry hated clearing up , but dutifully did every distasteful task , and kept her eye on careless Roxy till all was in order ; then she gladly went to perch on her father 's knee , seeing in all the faces about her the silent welcome they always wore for the `` little one . ''"
"`` Yes , I do want something , but I know you will say it is silly , '' she began , as her father pinched her blooming cheek , with the wish that his peaches would ever look half as well ."
"`` Should n't wonder if it was a doll now ; '' and Mr. Grant stroked her head with an indulgent smile , as if she was about six instead of fifteen ."
"`` Why , father , you know I do n't !"
I have n't played with dollies for years and years .
"No ; I want to fix up my room pretty , like Jill 's ."
"I 'll do it all myself , and only want a few things , for I do n't expect it to look as nice as hers . ''"
"Indignation gave Merry courage to state her wishes boldly , though she knew the boys would laugh ."
"They did , and her mother said in a tone of surprise , -- `` Why , child , what more can you want ?"
"I 'm sure your room is always as neat as a new pin , thanks to your bringing up , and I told you to have a fire there whenever you wanted to . ''"
"`` Let me have some old things out of the garret , and I 'll show you what I want ."
"It is neat , but so bare and ugly I hate to be there ."
I do so love something pretty to look at ! ''
and Merry gave a little shiver of disgust as she turned her eyes away from the large greasy boot Dick was holding up to be sure it was well lubricated all round .
"`` So do I , and that 's a fact ."
"I could n't get on without my pretty girl here , any way ."
"Why , she touches up the old place better than a dozen flower-pots in full blow , '' said the farmer , as his eye went from the scarlet geranium to the bright young face so near his own ."
`` I wish I had a dozen in the sitting-room window .
"Mother says they are not tidy , but I 'd keep them neat , and I know you 'd like it , '' broke in Merry , glad of the chance to get one of the long-desired wishes of her heart fulfilled ."
`` I 'll fetch you some next time I go over to Ballad 's .
"Tell me what you want , and we 'll have a posy bed somewhere round , see if we do n't , '' said her father , dimly understanding what she wanted ."
"`` Now , if mother says I may fix my room , I shall be satisfied , and I 'll do my chores without a bit of fuss , to show how grateful I am , '' said the girl , thanking her father with a kiss , and smiling at her mother so wistfully that the good woman could not refuse ."
`` You may have anything you like out of the blue chest .
"There 's a lot of things there that the moths got at after Grandma died , and I could n't bear to throw or give 'em away ."
"Trim up your room as you like , and mind you do n't forget your part of the bargain , '' answered Mrs. Grant , seeing profit in the plan ."
"`` I wo n't ; I 'll work all the morning to-morrow , and in the afternoon I 'll get ready to show you what I call a nice , pretty room , '' answered Merry , looking so pleased it seemed as if another flower had blossomed in the large bare kitchen ."
"She kept her word , and the very stormy afternoon when Jill got into trouble , Merry was working busily at her little bower ."
"In the blue chest she found a variety of treasures , and ignoring the moth holes , used them to the best advantage , trying to imitate the simple comfort with a touch of elegance which prevailed in Mrs. Minot 's back bedroom ."
"Three faded red-moreen curtains went up at the windows over the chilly paper shades , giving a pleasant glow to the bare walls ."
"A red quilt with white stars , rather the worse for many washings , covered the bed , and a gay cloth the table , where a judicious arrangement of books and baskets concealed the spots ."
"The little air-tight stove was banished , and a pair of ancient andirons shone in the fire-light ."
"Grandma 's last and largest braided rug lay on the hearth , and her brass candlesticks adorned the bureau , over the mirror of which was festooned a white muslin skirt , tied up with Merry 's red sash ."
But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements .
"If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade , he argued , they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold ."
Nor had we much time left to us for thought .
"Suddenly , with a loud huzza , a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade ."
"At the same moment , the fire was once more opened from the woods , and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor 's musket into bits ."
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys .
"Squire and Gray fired again and yet again ; three men fell , one forwards into the enclosure , two back on the outside ."
"But of these , one was evidently more frightened than hurt , for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees ."
"Two had bit the dust , one had fled , four had made good their footing inside our defences , while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men , each evidently supplied with several muskets , kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house ."
"The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building , shouting as they ran , and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them ."
"Several shots were fired , but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect ."
"In a moment , the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us ."
"The head of Job Anderson , the boatswain , appeared at the middle loophole ."
"`` At 'em , all hands -- all hands ! ''"
he roared in a voice of thunder .
"At the same moment , another pirate grasped Hunter 's musket by the muzzle , wrenched it from his hands , plucked it through the loophole , and with one stunning blow , laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor ."
"Meanwhile a third , running unharmed all around the house , appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor ."
Our position was utterly reversed .
"A moment since we were firing , under cover , at an exposed enemy ; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow ."
"The log-house was full of smoke , to which we owed our comparative safety ."
"Cries and confusion , the flashes and reports of pistol-shots , and one loud groan rang in my ears ."
"`` Out , lads , out , and fight 'em in the open !"
Cutlasses ! ''
cried the captain .
"I snatched a cutlass from the pile , and someone , at the same time snatching another , gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt ."
I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight .
"Someone was close behind , I knew not whom ."
"Right in front , the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill , and just as my eyes fell upon him , beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face ."
"`` Round the house , lads !"
Round the house ! ''
"cried the captain ; and even in the hurly-burly , I perceived a change in his voice ."
"Mechanically , I obeyed , turned eastwards , and with my cutlass raised , ran round the corner of the house ."
"She slept peacefully till midnight , when there was such a noise in the house that she awoke ."
"Everything trembled and shook ; the animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall ; the beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations , it seemed as if the stairs were tumbling down , and then the roof fell in with a crash ."
"Then all became still , and as no harm came to the maiden she lay down again and fell asleep ."
"But when she awoke again in broad daylight , what a sight met her eyes !"
"She was lying in a splendid room furnished with royal splendour ; the walls were covered with golden flowers on a green ground ; the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet , and on a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls ."
"The maiden thought she must be dreaming , but in came three servants richly dressed , who asked what were her commands ."
"` Go , ' said the maiden , ' I will get up at once and cook the old man 's supper for him , and then I will feed the pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow . '"
"But the door opened and in came a handsome young man , who said , ' I am a king 's son , and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man in this wood with no company but that of my three servants , who were transformed into a cock , a hen , and a brindled cow ."
The spell could only be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind not only to men but to beasts .
"You are that maiden , and last night at midnight we were freed , and this poor house was again transformed into my royal palace ."
As they stood there the king 's son told his three servants to go and fetch the maiden 's parents to be present at the wedding feast .
` But where are my two sisters ? '
asked the maid . '
"I shut them up in the cellar , but in the morning they shall be led forth into the forest and shall serve a charcoal burner until they have improved , and will never again suffer poor animals to go hungry . '"
"Uraschimataro and the Turtle From the Japanische Marchen und Sagen , von David Brauns -LRB- Leipzig : Wilhelm Friedrich -RRB- ."
"There was once a worthy old couple who lived on the coast , and supported themselves by fishing ."
"They had only one child , a son , who was their pride and joy , and for his sake they were ready to work hard all day long , and never felt tired or discontented with their lot ."
"This son 's name was Uraschimataro , which means in Japanese , ` Son of the island , ' and he was a fine well-grown youth and a good fisherman , minding neither wind nor weather ."
"Not the bravest sailor in the whole village dared venture so far out to sea as Uraschimataro , and many a time the neighbours used to shake their heads and say to his parents , ` If your son goes on being so rash , one day he will try his luck once too often , and the waves will end by swallowing him up . '"
"But Uraschimataro paid no heed to these remarks , and as he was really very clever in managing a boat , the old people were very seldom anxious about him ."
"One beautiful bright morning , as he was hauling his well-filled nets into the boat , he saw lying among the fishes a tiny little turtle ."
"He was delighted with his prize , and threw it into a wooden vessel to keep till he got home , when suddenly the turtle found its voice , and tremblingly begged for its life ."
"` After all , ' it said , ` what good can I do you ?"
"I am so young and small , and I would so gladly live a little longer ."
"Be merciful and set me free , and I shall know how to prove my gratitude . '"
"Now Uraschimataro was very good-natured , and besides , he could never bear to say no , so he picked up the turtle , and put it back into the sea ."
"Years flew by , and every morning Uraschimataro sailed his boat into the deep sea ."
"But one day as he was making for a little bay between some rocks , there arose a fierce whirlwind , which shattered his boat to pieces , and she was sucked under by the waves ."
Uraschimataro himself very nearly shared the same fate .
"But he was a powerful swimmer , and struggled hard to reach the shore ."
"Then he saw a large turtle coming towards him , and above the howling of the storm he heard what it said : ' I am the turtle whose life you once saved ."
I will now pay my debt and show my gratitude .
`` But this would seem to involve my meeting the man Thomson ? ''
"says he , when I had done ."
"`` I think so , indeed , sir , '' said I. `` Dear doctor ! ''"
"cries he , rubbing his brow ."
`` Dear doctor !
"No , Mr. David , I am afraid your scheme is inadmissible ."
"I say nothing against your friend , Mr. Thomson : I know nothing against him ; and if I did -- mark this , Mr. David !"
-- it would be my duty to lay hands on him .
Now I put it to you : is it wise to meet ?
He may have matters to his charge .
He may not have told you all .
His name may not be even Thomson ! ''
"cries the lawyer , twinkling ; `` for some of these fellows will pick up names by the roadside as another would gather haws . ''"
"`` You must be the judge , sir , '' said I ."
"But it was clear my plan had taken hold upon his fancy , for he kept musing to himself till we were called to dinner and the company of Mrs. Rankeillor ; and that lady had scarce left us again to ourselves and a bottle of wine , ere he was back harping on my proposal ."
"When and where was I to meet my friend Mr. Thomson ; was I sure of Mr. T. 's discretion ; supposing we could catch the old fox tripping , would I consent to such and such a term of an agreement -- these and the like questions he kept asking at long intervals , while he thoughtfully rolled his wine upon his tongue ."
"When I had answered all of them , seemingly to his contentment , he fell into a still deeper muse , even the claret being now forgotten ."
"Then he got a sheet of paper and a pencil , and set to work writing and weighing every word ; and at last touched a bell and had his clerk into the chamber ."
"`` Torrance , '' said he , `` I must have this written out fair against to-night ; and when it is done , you will be so kind as put on your hat and be ready to come along with this gentleman and me , for you will probably be wanted as a witness . ''"
"`` What , sir , '' cried I , as soon as the clerk was gone , `` are you to venture it ? ''"
"`` Why , so it would appear , '' says he , filling his glass ."
`` But let us speak no more of business .
"The very sight of Torrance brings in my head a little droll matter of some years ago , when I had made a tryst with the poor oaf at the cross of Edinburgh ."
"Each had gone his proper errand ; and when it came four o'clock , Torrance had been taking a glass and did not know his master , and I , who had forgot my spectacles , was so blind without them , that I give you my word I did not know my own clerk . ''"
And thereupon he laughed heartily .
"I said it was an odd chance , and smiled out of politeness ; but what held me all the afternoon in wonder , he kept returning and dwelling on this story , and telling it again with fresh details and laughter ; so that I began at last to be quite put out of countenance and feel ashamed for my friend 's folly ."
"Towards the time I had appointed with Alan , we set out from the house , Mr. Rankeillor and I arm in arm , and Torrance following behind with the deed in his pocket and a covered basket in his hand ."
"All through the town , the lawyer was bowing right and left , and continually being button-holed by gentlemen on matters of burgh or private business ; and I could see he was one greatly looked up to in the county ."
"At last we were clear of the houses , and began to go along the side of the haven and towards the Hawes Inn and the Ferry pier , the scene of my misfortune ."
"I could not look upon the place without emotion , recalling how many that had been there with me that day were now no more : Ransome taken , I could hope , from the evil to come ; Shuan passed where I dared not follow him ; and the poor souls that had gone down with the brig in her last plunge ."
"All these , and the brig herself , I had outlived ; and come through these hardships and fearful perils without scath ."
My only thought should have been of gratitude ; and yet I could not behold the place without sorrow for others and a chill of recollected fear .
"Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet , to vex her still more ; for she had always tucked them inside it , because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night ."
Then he nearly cried ; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead ; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it .
"Sometimes , though not often , he had dreams , and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys ."
"For hours he could not be separated from these dreams , though he wailed piteously in them ."
"They had to do , I think , with the riddle of his existence ."
"At such times it had been Wendy 's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap , soothing him in dear ways of her own invention , and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up , so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him ."
But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep .
"One arm dropped over the edge of the bed , one leg was arched , and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth , which was open , showing the little pearls ."
Thus defenceless Hook found him .
He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy .
Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast ?
"The man was not wholly evil ; he loved flowers -LRB- I have been told -RRB- and sweet music -LRB- he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord -RRB- ; and , let it be frankly admitted , the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly ."
"Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree , but for one thing ."
What stayed him was Peter 's impertinent appearance as he slept .
"The open mouth , the drooping arm , the arched knee : they were such a personification of cockiness as , taken together , will never again , one may hope , be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness ."
They steeled Hook 's heart .
"If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident , and leapt at the sleeper ."
"Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed , Hook stood in darkness himself , and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle , the door of Slightly 's tree ."
"It did not entirely fill the aperture , and he had been looking over it ."
"Feeling for the catch , he found to his fury that it was low down , beyond his reach ."
"To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter 's face and figure visibly increased , and he rattled the door and flung himself against it ."
Was his enemy to escape him after all ?
But what was that ?
The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter 's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach .
"He fathomed what it was straightaway , and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power ."
"Lest he should be taken alive , Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug , blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his possession ."
"These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science , which was probably the most virulent poison in existence ."
Five drops of this he now added to Peter 's cup .
"His hand shook , but it was in exultation rather than in shame ."
"As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper , but not lest pity should unnerve him ; merely to avoid spilling ."
"Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim , and turning , wormed his way with difficulty up the tree ."
As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole .
His sons were so frightened at the sight that they all ran away .
And in this manner Patto avenged his dead children .
"But though Stalo was dead , his three sons were still living , and not very far off either ."
"They had gone to their mother , who was tending some reindeer on the pastures , and told her that by some magic , they knew not what , their father 's head had rolled from his body , and they had been so afraid that something dreadful would happen to them that they had come to take refuge with her ."
The ogress said nothing .
"Long ago she had found out how stupid her sons were , so she just sent them out to milk the reindeer , while she returned to the other house to bury her husband 's body ."
"Now , three days ' journey from the hut on the pastures two brothers Sodno dwelt in a small cottage with their sister Lyma , who tended a large herd of reindeer while they were out hunting ."
"Of late it had been whispered from one to another that the three young Stalos were to be seen on the pastures , but the Sodno brothers did not disturb themselves , the danger seemed too far away ."
"Unluckily , however , one day , when Lyma was left by herself in the hut , the three Stalos came down and carried her and the reindeer off to their own cottage ."
"The country was very lonely , and perhaps no one would have known in which direction she had gone had not the girl managed to tie a ball of thread to the handle of a door at the back of the cottage and let it trail behind her ."
"Of course the ball was not long enough to go all the way , but it lay on the edge of a snowy track which led straight to the Stalos ' house ."
When the brothers returned from their hunting they found both the hut and the sheds empty .
Loudly they cried : ` Lyma !
Lyma ! '
"But no voice answered them ; and they fell to searching all about , lest perchance their sister might have dropped some clue to guide them ."
"At length their eyes dropped on the thread which lay on the snow , and they set out to follow it ."
"On and on they went , and when at length the thread stopped the brothers knew that another day 's journey would bring them to the Stalos ' dwelling ."
"Of course they did not dare to approach it openly , for the Stalos had the strength of giants , and besides , there were three of them ; so the two Sodnos climbed into a big bushy tree which overhung a well ."
"` Perhaps our sister may be sent to draw water here , ' they said to each other ."
"But it was not till the moon had risen that the sister came , and as she let down her bucket into the well , the leaves seemed to whisper ` Lyma !"
Lyma ! '
"The girl started and looked up , but could see nothing , and in a moment the voice came again ."
"` Be careful -- take no notice , fill your buckets , but listen carefully all the while , and we will tell you what to do so that you may escape yourself and set free the reindeer also . '"
"So Lyman bent over the well lower than before , and seemed busier than ever ."
"` You know , ' said her brother , ` that when a Stalo finds that anything has been dropped into his food he will not eat a morsel , but throws it to his dogs ."
"Now , after the pot has been hanging some time over the fire , and the broth is nearly cooked , just rake up the log of wood so that some of the ashes fly into the pot ."
"The Stalo will soon notice this , and will call you to give all the food to the dogs ; but , instead , you must bring it straight to us , as it is three days since we have eaten or drunk ."
That is all you need do for the present . '
"Then Lyma took up her buckets and carried them into the house , and did as her brothers had told her ."
"They were so hungry that they ate the food up greedily without speaking , but when there was nothing left in the pot , the eldest one said : ` Listen carefully to what I have to tell you ."
"After the eldest Stalo has cooked and eaten a fresh supper , he will go to bed and sleep so soundly that not even a witch could wake him ."
"You can hear him snoring a mile off , and then you must go into his room and pull off the iron mantle that covers him , and put it on the fire till it is almost red hot ."
"With a cry John seized the branch of a tree , whipped the crutch out of his armpit , and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air ."
"It struck poor Tom , point foremost , and with stunning violence , right between the shoulders in the middle of his back ."
"His hands flew up , he gave a sort of gasp , and fell ."
"Whether he were injured much or little , none could ever tell ."
"Like enough , to judge from the sound , his back was broken on the spot ."
But he had no time given him to recover .
"Silver , agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch , was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body ."
"From my place of ambush , I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows ."
"I do not know what it rightly is to faint , but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist ; Silver and the birds , and the tall Spy-glass hilltop , going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes , and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear ."
"When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together , his crutch under his arm , his hat upon his head ."
"Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward ; but the murderer minded him not a whit , cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass ."
"Everything else was unchanged , the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain , and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes ."
"But now John put his hand into his pocket , brought out a whistle , and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air ."
"I could not tell , of course , the meaning of the signal , but it instantly awoke my fears ."
More men would be coming .
I might be discovered .
"They had already slain two of the honest people ; after Tom and Alan , might not I come next ?"
"Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again , with what speed and silence I could manage , to the more open portion of the wood ."
"As I did so , I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades , and this sound of danger lent me wings ."
"As soon as I was clear of the thicket , I ran as I never ran before , scarce minding the direction of my flight , so long as it led me from the murderers ; and as I ran , fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy ."
"Indeed , could anyone be more entirely lost than I ?"
"When the gun fired , how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends , still smoking from their crime ?"
Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipe 's ?
"Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm , and therefore of my fatal knowledge ?"
"It was all over , I thought ."
"Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA ; good-bye to the squire , the doctor , and the captain !"
There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers .
"All this while , as I say , I was still running , and without taking any notice , I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions ."
"Mingled with these were a few scattered pines , some fifty , some nearer seventy , feet high ."
The air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh .
And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart .
"15 The Man of the Island FROM the side of the hill , which was here steep and stony , a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees ."
"-LSB- Illustration : A hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail -RSB- But as Peter sat by the shore tootling divinely on his pipe he sometimes fell into sad thoughts , and then the music became sad also , and the reason of all this sadness was that he could not reach the Gardens , though he could see them through the arch of the bridge ."
"He knew he could never be a real human again , and scarcely wanted to be one , but oh !"
"how he longed to play as other children play , and of course there is no such lovely place to play in as the Gardens ."
"The birds brought him news of how boys and girls play , and wistful tears started in Peter 's eyes ."
Perhaps you wonder why he did not swim across .
The reason was that he could not swim .
"He wanted to know how to swim , but no one on the island knew the way except the ducks , and they are so stupid ."
"They were quite willing to teach him , but all they could say about it was , ` You sit down on the top of the water in this way , and then you kick out like that . '"
"Peter tried it often , but always before he could kick out he sank ."
"What he really needed to know was how you sit on the water without sinking , and they said it was quite impossible to explain such an easy thing as that ."
"Occasionally swans touched on the island , and he would give them all his day 's food and then ask them how they sat on the water , but as soon as he had no more to give them the hateful things hissed at him and sailed away ."
Once he really thought he had discovered a way of reaching the Gardens .
"A wonderful white thing , like a runaway newspaper , floated high over the island and then tumbled , rolling over and over after the manner of a bird that has broken its wing ."
"Peter was so frightened that he hid , but the birds told him it was only a kite , and what a kite is , and that it must have tugged its string out of a boy 's hand , and soared away ."
"After that they laughed at Peter for being so fond of the kite ; he loved it so much that he even slept with one hand on it , and I think this was pathetic and pretty , for the reason he loved it was because it had belonged to a real boy ."
"-LSB- Illustration : After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise -RSB- To the birds this was a very poor reason , but the older ones felt grateful to him at this time because he had nursed a number of fledglings through the German measles , and they offered to show him how birds fly a kite ."
So six of them took the end of the string in their beaks and flew away with it ; and to his amazement it flew after them and went even higher than they .
"Peter screamed out , ` Do it again ! '"
"and with great good-nature they did it several times , and always instead of thanking them he cried , ` Do it again ! '"
which shows that even now he had not quite forgotten what it was to be a boy .
"At last , with a grand design burning within his brave heart , he begged them to do it once more with him clinging to the tail , and now a hundred flew off with the string , and Peter clung to the tail , meaning to drop off when he was over the Gardens ."
"But the kite broke to pieces in the air , and he would have been drowned in the Serpentine had he not caught hold of two indignant swans and made them carry him to the island ."
After this the birds said that they would help him no more in his mad enterprise .
"Nevertheless , Peter did reach the Gardens at last by the help of Shelley 's boat , as I am now to tell you ."
-LSB- Illustration : Tailpiece to ` Peter Pan ' -RSB- -LSB- Illustration : Headpiece to ` The Thrush 's Nest ' -RSB- III THE THRUSH 'S NEST Shelley was a young gentleman and as grown-up as he need ever expect to be .
He was a poet ; and they are never exactly grown-up .
"They are people who despise money except what you need for to-day , and he had all that and five pounds over ."
"So , when he was walking in the Kensington Gardens , he made a paper boat of his bank-note , and sent it sailing on the Serpentine ."
"It reached the island at night ; and the look-out brought it to Solomon Caw , who thought at first that it was the usual thing , a message from a lady , saying she would be obliged if he could let her have a good one ."
"They always ask for the best one he has , and if he likes the letter he sends one from Class A , but if it ruffles him he sends very funny ones indeed ."
"Sometimes he sends none at all , and at another time he sends a nestful ; it all depends on the mood you catch him in ."
"He likes you to leave it all to him , and if you mention particularly that you hope he will see his way to making it a boy this time , he is almost sure to send another girl ."
"A dense forest lay all round the cottage , and there was hardly a path or a tree in the whole wood that was not familiar to the peasant from his boyhood ."
"In one of his wanderings he had made friends with a hare , and many an hour the two passed together , when the man was resting by the roadside , eating his dinner ."
"Now this strange friendship was observed by the Tanuki , a wicked , quarrelsome beast , who hated the peasant , and was never tired of doing him an ill turn ."
"Again and again he had crept to the hut , and finding some choice morsel put away for the little hare , had either eaten it if he thought it nice , or trampled it to pieces so that no one else should get it , and at last the peasant lost patience , and made up his mind he would have the Tanuki 's blood ."
"So for many days the man lay hidden , waiting for the Tanuki to come by , and when one morning he marched up the road thinking of nothing but the dinner he was going to steal , the peasant threw himself upon him and bound his four legs tightly , so that he could not move ."
"Then he dragged his enemy joyfully to the house , feeling that at length he had got the better of the mischievous beast which had done him so many ill turns ."
"` He shall pay for them with his skin , ' he said to his wife ."
"` We will first kill him , and then cook him . '"
"So saying , he hanged the Tanuki , head downwards , to a beam , and went out to gather wood for a fire ."
Meanwhile the old woman was standing at the mortar pounding the rise that was to serve them for the week with a pestle that made her arms ache with its weight .
"Suddenly she heard something whining and weeping in the corner , and , stopping her work , she looked round to see what it was ."
"That was all that the rascal wanted , and he put on directly his most humble air , and begged the woman in his softest voice to loosen his bonds , which her hurting him sorely ."
"She was filled with pity for him , but did not dare to set him free , as she knew that her husband would be very angry ."
"The Tanuki , however , did not despair , and seeing that her heart was softened , began his prayers anew ."
"` He only asked to have his bonds taken from him , ' he said ."
"` He would give his word not to attempt to escape , and if he was once set free he could soon pound her rice for her . '"
"` Then you can have a little rest , ' he went on , ` for rice pounding is very tiring work , and not at all fit for weak women . '"
"These last words melted the good woman completely , and she unfastened the bonds that held him ."
Poor foolish creature !
"In one moment the Tanuki had seized her , stripped off all her clothes , and popped her in the mortar ."
"In a few minutes more she was pounded as fine as the rice ; and not content with that , the Tanuki placed a pot on the hearth and made ready to cook the peasant a dinner from the flesh of his own wife !"
"When everything was complete he looked out of the door , and saw the old man coming from the forest carrying a large bundle of wood ."
"Quick as lightning the Tanuki not only put on the woman 's clothes , but , as he was a magician , assumed her form as well ."
"Then he took the wood , kindled the fire , and very soon set a large dinner before the old man , who was very hungry , and had forgotten for the moment all about his enemy ."
"But when the Tanuki saw that he had eaten his fill and would be thinking about his prisoner , he hastily shook off the clothes behind a door and took his own shape ."
"Then he said to the peasant , ` You are a nice sort of person to seize animals and to talk of killing them !"
You are caught in your own net .
"It is your own wife that you have eaten , and if you want to find her bones you have only to look under the floor . '"
With these words he turned and made for the forest .
"The old peasant grew cold with horror as he listened , and seemed frozen to the place where he stood ."
"When he had recovered himself a little , he collected the bones of his dead wife , buried them in the garden , and swore over the grave to be avenged on the Tanuki ."
"After everything was done he sat himself down in his lonely cottage and wept bitterly , and the bitterest thought of all was that he would never be able to forget that he had eaten his own wife ."
"Of course the king was quite ignorant of these arrangements , and boldly entered the palace of the Lion Fairy , who was waiting for him , with her tail lashing furiously , for she still kept her lion 's shape ."
"With a roar that shook the walls she flung herself upon him ; but he was on the watch , and a blow from his sword cut off the paw she had put forth to strike him dead ."
"She fell back , and with his helmet still on and his shield up , he set his foot on her throat ."
"` Give me back the wife and the child you have stolen from me , ' he said , ` or you shall not live another second ! '"
But the fairy answered : ` Look through the window at that lake and see if it is in my power to give them to you . '
"And the king looked , and through the crystal walls he beheld his wife and daughter floating on the quicksilver ."
At that sight the Lion Fairy and all her wickedness was forgotten .
"Flinging off his helmet , he shouted to them with all his might ."
"The queen knew his voice , and she and Muffette ran to the window and held out their hands ."
"Then the king swore a solemn oath that he would never leave the spot without taking them if it should cost him his life ; and he meant it , though at the moment he did not know what he was undertaking ."
"Three years passed by , and the king was no nearer to obtaining his heart 's desire ."
"He had suffered every hardship that could be imagined -- nettles had been his bed , wild fruits more bitter than gall his food , while his days had been spent in fighting the hideous monsters which kept him from the palace ."
"He had not advanced one single step , nor gained one solitary advantage ."
"Now he was almost in despair , and ready to defy everything and throw himself into the lake ."
"It was at this moment of his blackest misery that , one night , a dragon who had long watched him from the roof crept to his side ."
"` You thought that love would conquer all obstacles , ' said he ; ` well , you have found it has n't !"
"But if you will swear to me by your crown and sceptre that you will give me a dinner of the food that I never grow tired of , whenever I choose to ask for it , I will enable you to reach your wife and daughter . '"
"Ah , how glad the king was to hear that !"
What oath would he not have taken so as to clasp his wife and child in is arms ?
"Joyfully he swore whatever the dragon asked of him ; then he jumped on his back , and in another instant would have been carried by the strong wings into the castle if the nearest monsters had not happened to awake and hear the noise of talking and swum to the shore to give battle ."
"The fight was long and hard , and when the king at last beat back his foes another struggle awaited him ."
"At the entrance gigantic bats , owls , and crows set upon him from all sides ; but the dragon had teeth and claws , while the queen broke off sharp bits of glass and stabbed and cut in her anxiety to help her husband ."
"At length the horrible creatures flew away ; a sound like thunder was heard , the palace and the monsters vanished , while , at the same moment -- no one knew how -- the king found himself standing with his wife and daughter in the hall of his own home ."
"The dragon had disappeared with all the rest , and for some years no more was heard or thought of him ."
"Muffette grew every day more beautiful , and when she was fourteen the kings and emperors of the neighbouring countries sent to ask her in marriage for themselves or their sons ."
"For a long time the girl turned a deaf ear to all their prayers ; but at length a young prince of rare gifts touched her heart , and though the king had left her free to choose what husband she would , he had secretly hoped that out of all the wooers this one might be his son-in-law ."
"So they were betrothed that some day with great pomp , and then with many tears , the prince set out for his father 's court , bearing with him a portrait of Muffette ."
"The days passed slowly to Muffette , in spite of her brave efforts to occupy herself and not to sadden other people by her complaints ."
One morning she was playing on her harp in the queen 's chamber when the king burst into the room and clasped his daughter in his arms with an energy that almost frightened her .
"` Oh , my child !"
my dear child !
why were you ever born ? '
"To add to our concern , we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore , and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether , if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen , they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm ."
"Hunter was steady , that we knew ; Joyce was a doubtful case -- a pleasant , polite man for a valet and to brush one 's clothes , but not entirely fitted for a man of war ."
"With all this in our minds , we waded ashore as fast as we could , leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions ."
"18 Narrative Continued by the Doctor : End of the First Day 's Fighting WE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade , and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer ."
Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket .
I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming .
"`` Captain , '' said I , `` Trelawney is the dead shot ."
Give him your gun ; his own is useless . ''
"They exchanged guns , and Trelawney , silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle , hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service ."
"At the same time , observing Gray to be unarmed , I handed him my cutlass ."
"It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand , knit his brows , and make the blade sing through the air ."
It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt .
Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us .
"We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side , and almost at the same time , seven mutineers -- Job Anderson , the boatswain , at their head -- appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner ."
"They paused as if taken aback , and before they recovered , not only the squire and I , but Hunter and Joyce from the block house , had time to fire ."
"The four shots came in rather a scattering volley , but they did the business : one of the enemy actually fell , and the rest , without hesitation , turned and plunged into the trees ."
"After reloading , we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy ."
He was stone dead -- shot through the heart .
"We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush , a ball whistled close past my ear , and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground ."
"Both the squire and I returned the shot , but as we had nothing to aim at , it is probable we only wasted powder ."
Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom .
"The captain and Gray were already examining him , and I saw with half an eye that all was over ."
"I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more , for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried , groaning and bleeding , into the log-house ."
"Poor old fellow , he had not uttered one word of surprise , complaint , fear , or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now , when we had laid him down in the log-house to die ."
"He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery ; he had followed every order silently , doggedly , and well ; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years ; and now , sullen , old , serviceable servant , it was he that was to die ."
"The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand , crying like a child ."
"`` Be I going , doctor ? ''"
he asked .
"`` Tom , my man , '' said I , `` you 're going home . ''"
"`` I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first , '' he replied ."
"`` Tom , '' said the squire , `` say you forgive me , wo n't you ? ''"
"`` Would that be respectful like , from me to you , squire ? ''"
"He , for his part , took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity ."
"`` For thirty years , '' he said , `` I 've sailed the seas and seen good and bad , better and worse , fair weather and foul , provisions running out , knives going , and what not ."
"Well , now I tell you , I never seen good come o ' goodness yet ."
"Him as strikes first is my fancy ; dead men do n't bite ; them 's my views -- amen , so be it ."
"And now , you look here , '' he added , suddenly changing his tone , `` we 've had about enough of this foolery ."
The tide 's made good enough by now .
"You just take my orders , Cap'n Hawkins , and we 'll sail slap in and be done with it . ''"
"All told , we had scarce two miles to run ; but the navigation was delicate , the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal , but lay east and west , so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in ."
"I think I was a good , prompt subaltern , and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot , for we went about and about and dodged in , shaving the banks , with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold ."
Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us .
"The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage , but the space was longer and narrower and more like , what in truth it was , the estuary of a river ."
"Right before us , at the southern end , we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation ."
"It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed , and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers ."
"It was a sad sight , but it showed us that the anchorage was calm ."
"`` Now , '' said Hands , `` look there ; there 's a pet bit for to beach a ship in ."
"Fine flat sand , never a cat 's paw , trees all around of it , and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship . ''"
"`` And once beached , '' I inquired , `` how shall we get her off again ? ''"
"`` Why , so , '' he replied : `` you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water , take a turn about one of them big pines ; bring it back , take a turn around the capstan , and lie to for the tide ."
"Come high water , all hands take a pull upon the line , and off she comes as sweet as natur ' ."
"And now , boy , you stand by ."
"We 're near the bit now , and she 's too much way on her ."
Starboard a little -- so -- steady -- starboard -- larboard a little -- steady -- steady ! ''
"So he issued his commands , which I breathlessly obeyed , till , all of a sudden , he cried , `` Now , my hearty , luff ! ''"
"And I put the helm hard up , and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low , wooded shore ."
"The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto , sharply enough , upon the coxswain ."
"Even then I was still so much interested , waiting for the ship to touch , that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows ."
I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head .
"Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye ; perhaps it was an instinct like a cat 's ; but , sure enough , when I looked round , there was Hands , already half-way towards me , with the dirk in his right hand ."
"We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met , but while mine was the shrill cry of terror , his was a roar of fury like a charging bully 's ."
"At the same instant , he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows ."
"As I did so , I let go of the tiller , which sprang sharp to leeward , and I think this saved my life , for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him , for the moment , dead ."
"Before he could recover , I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped , with all the deck to dodge about ."
said Alan .
`` Still in his own country and kept by his own clan .
King George can do no more . ''
"I think I would have asked farther , but Alan gave me the put-off ."
"`` I am rather wearied , '' he said , `` and I would like fine to get a sleep . ''"
"And without more words , he rolled on his face in a deep heather bush , and seemed to sleep at once ."
There was no such thing possible for me .
You have heard grasshoppers whirring in the grass in the summer time ?
"Well , I had no sooner closed my eyes , than my body , and above all my head , belly , and wrists , seemed to be filled with whirring grasshoppers ; and I must open my eyes again at once , and tumble and toss , and sit up and lie down ; and look at the sky which dazzled me , or at Cluny 's wild and dirty sentries , peering out over the top of the brae and chattering to each other in the Gaelic ."
"That was all the rest I had , until the messenger returned ; when , as it appeared that Cluny would be glad to receive us , we must get once more upon our feet and set forward ."
"Alan was in excellent good spirits , much refreshed by his sleep , very hungry , and looking pleasantly forward to a dram and a dish of hot collops , of which , it seems , the messenger had brought him word ."
"For my part , it made me sick to hear of eating ."
"I had been dead-heavy before , and now I felt a kind of dreadful lightness , which would not suffer me to walk ."
"I drifted like a gossamer ; the ground seemed to me a cloud , the hills a feather-weight , the air to have a current , like a running burn , which carried me to and fro ."
"With all that , a sort of horror of despair sat on my mind , so that I could have wept at my own helplessness ."
"I saw Alan knitting his brows at me , and supposed it was in anger ; and that gave me a pang of light-headed fear , like what a child may have ."
"I remember , too , that I was smiling , and could not stop smiling , hard as I tried ; for I thought it was out of place at such a time ."
"But my good companion had nothing in his mind but kindness ; and the next moment , two of the gillies had me by the arms , and I began to be carried forward with great swiftness -LRB- or so it appeared to me , although I dare say it was slowly enough in truth -RRB- , through a labyrinth of dreary glens and hollows and into the heart of that dismal mountain of Ben Alder ."
"CHAPTER XXIII CLUNY 'S CAGE We came at last to the foot of an exceeding steep wood , which scrambled up a craggy hillside , and was crowned by a naked precipice ."
"`` It 's here , '' said one of the guides , and we struck up hill ."
"The trees clung upon the slope , like sailors on the shrouds of a ship , and their trunks were like the rounds of a ladder , by which we mounted ."
"Quite at the top , and just before the rocky face of the cliff sprang above the foliage , we found that strange house which was known in the country as `` Cluny 's Cage . ''"
"The trunks of several trees had been wattled across , the intervals strengthened with stakes , and the ground behind this barricade levelled up with earth to make the floor ."
"A tree , which grew out from the hillside , was the living centre-beam of the roof ."
The walls were of wattle and covered with moss .
"The whole house had something of an egg shape ; and it half hung , half stood in that steep , hillside thicket , like a wasp 's nest in a green hawthorn ."
"Within , it was large enough to shelter five or six persons with some comfort ."
"A projection of the cliff had been cunningly employed to be the fireplace ; and the smoke rising against the face of the rock , and being not dissimilar in colour , readily escaped notice from below ."
"This was but one of Cluny 's hiding-places ; he had caves , besides , and underground chambers in several parts of his country ; and following the reports of his scouts , he moved from one to another as the soldiers drew near or moved away ."
"By this manner of living , and thanks to the affection of his clan , he had not only stayed all this time in safety , while so many others had fled or been taken and slain : but stayed four or five years longer , and only went to France at last by the express command of his master ."
There he soon died ; and it is strange to reflect that he may have regretted his Cage upon Ben Alder .
"When we came to the door he was seated by his rock chimney , watching a gillie about some cookery ."
"But Nurse said: ""Don't count your chickens, my dear. You haven't seen the last of that Dragon yet."""
"Now, the next day was Saturday. And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness, and carried off the Soccer Players, umpires, goal-posts, ball, and all."
"Then the people were very angry indeed, and they said: ""We might as well be a Republic. After saving up all these years to get his crown, and everything!"""
"And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National Love of Sport. And, indeed, soccer was not at all popular for some time afterward."
"Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week, and the people were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book."
"""After all,"" they said, ""soccer is a dangerous game, and perhaps it is wise to discourage it."""
"Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players, being tough and hard, had disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place where they only play cats' cradle and games that do not make you hard and tough."
"All the same, Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon, a convenient time, for most of the Members would be free to attend, to consider the Dragon. But unfortunately the Dragon, who had only been asleep, woke up because it was Saturday, and he considered the Parliament, and afterwards there were not any Members left, so they tried to make a new Parliament, but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as unpopular as soccer playing, and no one would consent to be elected, so they had to do without a Parliament. When the next Saturday came around everyone was a little nervous, but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that day and only ate an Orphanage."
"Lionel was very, very unhappy. He felt that it was his disobedience that had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the Soccer Players, and he felt that it was his duty to try and do something. The question was, what?"
"The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in the Palace rose garden, and the Butterfly was very tame, and would perch on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies: so Lionel saw that all the creatures in The Book of Beasts could not be wicked, like the Dragon, and he thought: ""Suppose I could get another beast out who would fight the Dragon?"""
"So he took The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden and opened the page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see what the name was. He could only see ""cora,"" but he felt the middle of the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come out, and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it suddenly, very hard, that he managed to get it shut. Then he fastened the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the Chancellor, who had been ill since Saturday, and so had not been eaten with the rest of the Parliament, and he said: ""What animal ends in 'cora'?"""
"The Chancellor answered: ""The Manticora, of course."""
"""What is he like?"" asked the King."
"""He is the sworn foe of Dragons,"" said the Chancellor. ""He drinks their blood. He is yellow, with the body of a lion and the face of a man. I wish we had a few Manticoras here now. But the last died hundreds of years ago worse luck!"""
"Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had ""cora"" on it, and there was the picture Manticora, all yellow, with a lion's body and a man's face, just as the Chancellor had said. And under the picture was written, ""Manticora."""
"In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book, rubbing its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously. It seemed very stupid, and when Lionel gave it a push and said, ""Go along and fight the Dragon, do,"" it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away. It went and hid behind the Town Hall, and at night when the people were asleep it went around and ate all the pussy-cats in the town. And then it mewed more than ever. And on the Saturday morning, when people were a little timid about going out, because the Dragon had no regular hour for calling, the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the milk that was left in the cans at the doors for people's teas, and it ate the cans as well."
"And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth, which was short measure, because the milkman's nerves were quite upset, the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora. It edged off when it saw him coming, for it was not at all the Dragon-fighting kind; and, seeing no other door open, the poor, hunted creature took refuge in the General Post Office, and there the Dragon found it, trying to conceal itself among the ten o'clock mail. The Dragon fell on the Manticora at once, and the mail was no defense. The mewings were heard all over the town. All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully. Then there was a sad silence, and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting fire and smoke, together with tufts of Manticora fur, and the fragments of the registered letters. Things were growing very serious. However popular the King might become during the week, the Dragon was sure to do something on Saturday to upset the people's loyalty."
"The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday, except during the hour of noon, and then he had to rest under a tree or he would have caught fire from the heat of the sun. You see, he was very hot to begin with."
"At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal nursery and carried off the King's own pet Rocking Horse. Then the King cried for six days, and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to stop. He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the Butterfly fluttering among the lilies, and he said: ""Nurse, wipe my face, please. I am not going to cry any more."""
"Nurse washed his face, and told him not to be a silly little King."
"""Crying,"" said she, ""never did anyone any good yet."""
"""I don't know,"" said the little King, ""I seem to see better, and to hear better now that I've cried for a week. Now, Nurse, dear, I know I'm right, so kiss me in case I never come back. I must try to see if I can't save the people."""
"""Well, if you must, you must,"" said Nurse, ""but don't tear your clothes or get your feet wet."""
So off he went.
"The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever, and the Butterfly shone more brightly, as Lionel once more carried The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden, and opened it very quickly, so that he might not be afraid and change his mind. The book fell open wide, almost in the middle, and there was written at the bottom of the page, ""Hippogriff,"" and before Lionel had time to see what the picture was, there was a fluttering of great wings and a stamping of hoofs, and a sweet, soft, friendly neighing; and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a long, long, white mane and a long, long, white tail, and he had great wings like swan's wings, and the softest, kindest eyes in the world, and he stood there among the roses."
"The Hippogriff rubbed its silky-soft, milky white nose against the little King's shoulder, and the little King thought: ""But for the wings you are very like my poor, dear lost Rocking Horse."" And the Blue Bird's song was very loud and sweet."
"Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling, sprawling, wicked shape of the Red Dragon. And he knew at once what he must do. He caught up The Book of Beasts and jumped on the back of the gentle, beautiful Hippogriff, and leaning down he whispered in the sharp, white ear: ""Fly, dear Hippogriff, fly your very fastest to the Pebbly Waste."""
"And when the Dragon saw them start, he turned and flew after them, with his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset, and the Hippogriff's wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise."
"When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff and the King they all came out of their houses to look, and when they saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst, and began to think what they would wear for Court mourning."
"But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff. The red wings were bigger than the white ones, but they were not so strong, and so the white-winged horse flew away and away and away, with the Dragon pursuing, till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste."
"Now, the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there is no sand all round, loose, shifting stones, and there is no grass there and no tree within a hundred miles of it."
"Lionel jumped off the white horse's back in the very middle of the Pebbly Waste, and he hurriedly unclasped The Book of Beasts and laid it open on the pebbles. Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste to get back on to his white horse, and had just jumped on when up came the Dragon. He was flying very feebly, and looking around everywhere for a tree, for it was just on the stroke of twelve, the sun was shining like a gold guinea in the blue sky, and there was not a tree for a hundred miles."
"The white-winged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed on the dry pebbles. He was getting very hot: indeed, parts of him even had begun to smoke. He knew that he must certainly catch fire in another minute unless he could get under a tree. He made a snatch with his red claws at the King and Hippogriff, but he was too feeble to reach them, and besides, he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he should get any hotter."
"It was then that he saw The Book of Beasts lying on the pebbles, open at the page with ""Dragon"" written at the bottom. He looked and he hesitated, and he looked again, and then, with one last squirm of rage, the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the palm tree, and the page was a little singed as he went in."
"As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there, he jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang."
"""Oh, hurrah!"" he cried. ""Now we really have done it."""
And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps.
"""Oh, my precious Hippogriff,"" he cried. ""You are the bravest, dearest, most beautiful """
"""Hush,"" whispered the Hippogriff modestly. ""Don't you see that we are not alone?"""
"And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste: the Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse, and indeed everyone who had been eaten by the Dragon. You see, it was impossible for the Dragon to take them into the book with him it was a tight fit even for one Dragon so, of course, he had to leave them outside."
"They all got home somehow, and all lived happy ever after."
"When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged to be allowed to go back into the book. ""I do not care for public life,"""
he said.
"Of course he knew his way onto his own page, so there was no danger of his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or anything. So he got back into his picture and has never come out since:"
"That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live, except in a picture-book. And of course he left the kitties outside, because there was no room for them in the book and the milk cans too."
"Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the Hippogriff's page of the book. ""I should like,"" he said, ""to live somewhere where Dragons can't get at me."""
"So the beautiful, white-winged Hippogriff showed him the way in, and there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his great-great-great-great-grandchildren to play with."
"As for the Hippogriff, he accepted the position of the King's Own Rocking Horse a situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden one. And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day."
"II. Uncle James, or The Purple Stranger"
The Princess and the gardener's boy were playing in the backyard.
"""What will you do when you grow up, Princess?"" asked the gardener's boy."
"""I should like to marry you, Tom,"" said the Princess. ""Would you mind?"""
"""No,"" said the gardener's boy. ""I shouldn't mind much. I'll marry you if you like if I have time."""
"For the gardener's boy meant, as soon as he was grown up, to be a general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil engineer. Meanwhile, he was top of all his classes at school, and tip-top of the geography class."
"As for the Princess Mary Ann, she was a very good little girl, and everyone loved her. She was always kind and polite, even to her Uncle James and to other people whom she did not like very much; and though she was not very clever, for a Princess, she always tried to do her lessons. Even if you know perfectly well that you can't do your lessons, you may as well try, and sometimes you find that by some fortunate accident they really are done. Then the Princess had a truly good heart: She was always kind to her pets. She never slapped her hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols, and she never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the backyard. Her elephant was devoted to her, and sometimes Mary Ann made her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across her throat, and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear."
"When the Princess had been good all through the week for, like all real, live, nice children, she was sometimes naughty, but never bad Nurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on Wednesday morning early and spend the day, because Wednesday is the end of the week in that country. Then, in the afternoon, when all the little dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it, Nurse would say: ""Now, my dears, what would you like to do this afternoon?"" just as if she didn't know. And the answer would be always the same:"
"""Oh, do let's go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep."""
"So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological Gardens, where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig, and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some grown-up person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose."
"There always was some such person, because in Rotundia everybody was kind except one."
"Now that you have read as far as this you know, of course, that the Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place; and if you are a thoughtful child as of course you are you will not need me to tell you what was the most remarkable thing about it. But in case you are not a thoughtful child and it is just possible of course that you are not I will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was. All the animals were the wrong sizes! And this was how it happened."
"In old, old, olden times, when all our world was just loose earth and air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding, and spinning around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their proper places, a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away by itself across the water, which was just beginning to try to get spread out smooth into a real sea. And as the great round piece of earth flew away, going around and around as hard as it could, it met a long piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy mixture, and the rock was so hard, and was going so fast, that it ran its point through the round piece of earth and stuck out on the other side of it, so that the two together were like a very-very-much-too-big spinning top."
"I am afraid all this is very dull, but you know geography is never quite lively, and after all, I must give you a little information even in a fairy tale like the powder in jam."
"Well, when the pointed rock smashed into the round bit of earth the shock was so great that it set them spinning together through the air which was just getting into its proper place, like all the rest of the things only, as luck would have it, they forgot which way around they had been going, and began to spin around the wrong way. Presently Center of Gravity a great giant who was managing the whole business woke up in the middle of the earth and began to grumble."
"""Oh, I'm so fond of you, I couldn't help doing it when I knew that your heart lay there,"" said the Princess."
"""How can you be so silly as to believe any such thing?"" said the Giant."
"""Oh yes; how can I help believing it, when you say it?"" said the Princess."
"""You're a goose,"" said the Giant; ""where my heart is, you will never come."""
"""Well,"" said the Princess; ""but for all that, 'twould be such a pleasure to know where it really lies."""
"Then the poor Giant could hold out no longer, but was forced to say:"
"""Far, far away in a lake lies an island; on that island stands a church; in that church is a well; in that well swims a duck; in that duck there is an egg, and in that egg there lies my heart, you darling!"""
"In the morning early, while it was still grey dawn, the Giant strode off to the wood."
"""Yes! now I must set off too,"" said Boots; ""if I only knew how to find the way."" He took a long, long farewell of the Princess, and when he got out of the Giant's door, there stood the Wolf waiting for him. So Boots told him all that had happened inside the house, and said now he wished to ride to the well in the church, if he only knew the way. So the Wolf bade him jump on his back, he'd soon find the way; and away they went, till the wind whistled after them, over hedge and field, over hill and dale. After they had travelled many, many days, they came at last to the lake. Then the Prince did not know how to get over it, but the Wolf bade him only not be afraid, but stick on, and so he jumped into the lake with the Prince on his back, and swam over to the island. So they came to the church; but the church keys hung high, high up on the top of the tower, and at first the Prince did not know how to get them down."
"""You must call on the raven,"" said the Wolf."
"So the Prince called on the raven, and in a trice the raven came, and flew up and fetched the keys, and so the Prince got into the church. But when he came to the well, there lay the duck, and swam about backwards and forwards, just as the Giant had said. So the Prince stood and coaxed it, till it came to him, and he grasped it in his hand; but just as he lifted it up from the water the duck dropped the egg into the well, and then Boots was beside himself to know how to get it out again."
"""Well, now you must call on the salmon to be sure,"" said the Wolf; and the king's son called on the salmon, and the salmon came and fetched up the egg from the bottom of the well."
"Then the Wolf told him to squeeze the egg, and as soon as ever he squeezed it the Giant screamed out."
"""Squeeze it again,"" said the Wolf; and when the Prince did so, the Giant screamed still more piteously, and begged and prayed so prettily to be spared, saying he would do all that the Prince wished if he would only not squeeze his heart in two."
"""Tell him, if he will restore to life again your six brothers and their brides, whom he has turned to stone, you will spare his life,"""
"said the Wolf. Yes, the Giant was ready to do that, and he turned the six brothers into king's sons again, and their brides into king's daughters."
"""Now, squeeze the egg in two,"" said the Wolf. So Boots squeezed the egg to pieces, and the Giant burst at once."
"Now, when he had made an end of the Giant, Boots rode back again on the Wolf to the Giant's house, and there stood all his six brothers alive and merry, with their brides. Then Boots went into the hill-side after his bride, and so they all set off home again to their father's house. And you may fancy how glad the old king was when he saw all his seven sons come back, each with his bride ""But the loveliest bride of all is the bride of Boots, after all,"" said the king, ""and he shall sit uppermost at the table, with her by his side."""
"So he sent out, and called a great wedding-feast, and the mirth was both loud and long, and if they have not done feasting, why, they are still at it."
THE PRINCESS ON THE GLASS HILL
"Once on a time there was a man who had a meadow, which lay high up on the hill-side, and in the meadow was a barn, which he had built to keep his hay in. Now, I must tell you, there hadn't been much in the barn for the last year or two, for every St. John's night, when the grass stood greenest and deepest, the meadow was eaten down to the very ground the next morning, just as if a whole drove of sheep had been there feeding on it over night. This happened once, and it happened twice; so at last the man grew weary of losing his crop of hay, and said to his sons for he had three of them, and the youngest was nicknamed Boots, of course that now one of them must go and sleep in the barn in the outlying field when St. John's night came, for it was too good a joke that his grass should be eaten, root and blade, this year, as it had been the last two years. So whichever of them went must keep a sharp look-out; that was what their father said."
"Well, the eldest son was ready to go and watch the meadow; trust him for looking after the grass! It shouldn't be his fault if man or beast, or the fiend himself, got a blade of grass. So, when evening came, he set off to the barn, and lay down to sleep; but a little on in the night came such a clatter, and such an earthquake, that walls and roof shook, and groaned, and creaked; then up jumped the lad, and took to his heels as fast as ever he could; nor dared he once look round till he reached home; and as for the hay, why it was eaten up this year just as it had been twice before."
"The next St. John's night, the man said again, it would never do to lose all the grass in the outlying field year after year in this way, so one of his sons must just trudge off to watch it, and watch it well too. Well, the next oldest son was ready to try his luck, so he set off, and lay down to sleep in the barn as his brother had done before him; but as the night wore on, there came on a rumbling and quaking of the earth, worse even than on the last St. John's night, and when the lad heard it, he got frightened, and took to his heels as though he were running a race."
"Next year the turn came to Boots; but when he made ready to go, the other two began to laugh and to make game of him, saying:"
"""You're just the man to watch the hay, that you are; you, who have done nothing all your life but sit in the ashes and toast yourself by the fire."""
"But Boots did not care a pin for their chattering, and stumped away as evening grew on, up the hill-side to the outlying field. There he went inside the barn and lay down; but in about an hour's time the barn began to groan and creak, so that it was dreadful to hear."
"""Well,"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I can stand it well enough."""
"A little while after came another creak and an earthquake, so that the litter in the barn flew about the lad's ears. ""Oh!"" said Boots to himself, ""if it isn't worse than this, I daresay I can stand it out."""
"But just then came a third rumbling, and a third earthquake, so that the lad thought walls and roof were coming down on his head; but it passed off, and all was still as death about him."
"Boston ladies gave up tea and used the dried leaves of the raspberry, and the girls of 1777 graduated in homespun. Could the iron heel of despotism crunch such a spirit of liberty as that? Scarcely. In one family at Newport four hundred and eighty-seven yards of cloth and thirty-six pairs of stockings were spun and made in eighteen months."
"When the war broke out it is estimated that each Colonial soldier had twenty-seven pairs of blue woollen socks with white double heels and toes. Does the intelligent reader believe that ""Tommy Atkins,"" with two pairs of socks ""and hit a-rainin',"" could whip men with twenty-seven pairs each? Not without restoratives."
"Troops were now sent to restore order. They were clothed by the British government, but boarded around with the Colonists. This was irritating to the people, because they had never met or called on the British troops. Again, they did not know the troops were coming, and had made no provision for them."
"Boston was considered the hot-bed of the rebellion, and General Gage was ordered to send two regiments of troops there. He did so, and a fight ensued, in which three citizens were killed."
"In looking over this incident, we must not forget that in those days three citizens went a good deal farther than they do now."
"The fight, however, was brief. General Gage, getting into a side street, separated from his command, and, coming out on the Common abruptly, he tried eight or nine more streets, but he came out each time on the Common, until, torn with conflicting emotions, he hired a Herdic, which took him around the corner to his quarters."
"On December 16, 1773, occurred the tea-party at Boston, which must have been a good deal livelier than those of to-day. The historian regrets that he was not there; he would have tried to be the life of the party."
"England had finally so arranged the price of tea that, including the tax, it was cheaper in America than in the old country. This exasperated the patriots, who claimed that they were confronted by a theory and not a condition. At Charleston this tea was stored in damp cellars, where it spoiled. New York and Philadelphia returned their ships, but the British would not allow any shenanegin', as George III. so tersely termed it, in Boston."
"Therefore a large party met in Faneuil Hall and decided that the tea should not be landed. A party made up as Indians, and, going on board, threw the tea overboard. Boston Harbor, as far out as the Bug Light, even to-day, is said to be carpeted with tea-grounds."
"George III. now closed Boston harbor and made General Gage Governor of Massachusetts. The Virginia Assembly murmured at this, and was dissolved and sent home without its mileage."
"Those opposed to royalty were termed Whigs, those in favor were called Tories. Now they are called Chappies or Authors."
"On the 5th of September, 1774, the first Continental Congress assembled at Philadelphia and was entertained by the Clover Club. Congress acted slowly even then, and after considerable delay resolved that the conduct of Great Britain was, under the circumstances, uncalled for. It also voted to hold no intercourse with Great Britain, and decided not to visit Shakespeare's grave unless the mother-country should apologize."
"In 1775, on the 19th of April, General Gage sent out troops to see about some military stores at Concord, but at Lexington he met with a company of minute-men gathering on the village green. Major Pitcairn, who was in command of the Tommies, rode up to the minute-men, and, drawing his bright new Sheffield sword, exclaimed, ""Disperse, you rebels! throw down your arms and disperse!"" or some such remark as that."
"The Americans hated to do that, so they did not. In the skirmish that ensued, seven of their number were killed."
"Thus opened the Revolutionary War, a contest which but for the earnestness and irritability of the Americans would have been extremely brief. It showed the relative difference between the fighting qualities of soldiers who fight for two pounds ten shillings per month and those who fight because they have lost their temper."
"The regulars destroyed the stores, but on the way home they found every rock-pile hid an old-fashioned gun and minute-man. This shows that there must have been an enormous number of minute-men then. All the English who got back to Boston were those who went out to reinforce the original command."
"The news went over the country like wildfire. These are the words of the historian. Really, that is a poor comparison, for wildfire doesn't jump rivers and bays, or get up and eat breakfast by candle-light in order to be on the road and spread the news."
"General Putnam left a pair of tired steers standing in the furrow, and rode one hundred miles without feed or water to Boston."
"Twenty thousand men were soon at work building intrenchments around Boston, so that the English troops could not get out to the suburbs where many of them resided."
I will now speak of the battle of Bunker Hill.
"This battle occurred June 17. The Americans heard that their enemy intended to fortify Bunker Hill, and so they determined to do it themselves, in order to have it done in a way that would be a credit to the town."
"A body of men under Colonel Prescott, after prayer by the President of Harvard University, marched to Charlestown Neck. They decided to fortify Breed's Hill, as it was more commanding, and all night long they kept on fortifying. The surprise of the English at daylight was well worth going from Lowell to witness."
"Howe sent three thousand men across and formed them on the landing. He marched them up the hill to within ten rods of the earth-works, when it occurred to Prescott that it would now be the appropriate thing to fire."
"He made a statement of that kind to his troops, and those of the enemy who were alive went back to Charlestown. But that was no place for them, as they had previously set it afire, so they came back up the hill, where they were once more well received and tendered the freedom of a future state."
"Three times the English did this, when the ammunition in the fortifications gave out, and they charged with fixed bayonets and reinforcements."
"The Americans were driven from the field, but it was a victory after all. It united the Colonies and made them so vexed at the English that it took some time to bring on an era of good feeling."
"Lord Howe, referring afterwards to this battle, said that the Americans did not stand up and fight like the regulars, suggesting that thereafter the Colonial army should arrange itself in the following manner before a battle!"
"Suddenly there was a flapping of wings, and the white grouse perched on the dragon's head and said: ""Can I be of any assistance?"""
"Now, by this time the children were so cold, so cold, so very, very cold, that they had forgotten everything but that, and they could say nothing else. So the white grouse said: ""One moment. I am only too grateful for this opportunity of showing my sense of your manly conduct about the firework!"""
"And the next moment there was a soft whispering rustle of wings overhead, and then, fluttering slowly, softly down, came hundreds and thousands of little white fluffy feathers. They fell on George and Jane like snowflakes, and, like flakes of fallen snow lying one above another, they grew into a thicker and thicker covering, so that presently the children were buried under a heap of white feathers, and only their faces peeped out."
"""Oh, you dear, good, kind white grouse,"" said Jane, ""but you'll be cold yourself, won't you, now you have given us all your pretty dear feathers?"""
"The white grouse laughed, and his laugh was echoed by thousands of kind, soft bird voices."
"""Did you think all those feathers came out of one breast? There are hundreds and hundreds of us here, and every one of us can spare a little tuft of soft breast feathers to help to keep two kind little hearts warm!"""
"Thus spoke the grouse, who certainly had very pretty manners."
"So now the children snuggled under the feathers and were warm, and when the sealskin dwarfs tried to take the feathers away, the grouse and his friends flew in their faces with flappings and screams, and drove the dwarfs back. They are a cowardly folk."
"The dragon had not moved yet but then he might at any moment get warm enough to move, and though George and Jane were now warm they were not comfortable nor easy in their minds. They tried to explain to the grouse; but though he is polite, he is not clever, and he only said:"
"""You've got a warm nest, and we'll see that no one takes it from you."
"What more can you possibly want?"""
"Just then came a new, strange, jerky fluttering of wings far softer than the grouse's, and George and Jane cried out together: ""Oh, do mind your wings in the fires!"""
For they saw at once that it was the great white Arctic moth.
"""What's the matter?"" he asked, settling on the dragon's tail."
So they told him.
"""Sealskin, are they?"" said the moth. ""Just you wait a minute!"""
"He flew off very crookedly, dodging the flames, and presently he came back, and there were so many moths with him that it was as if a live sheet of white wingedness were suddenly drawn between the children and the stars."
And then the doom of the bad sealskin dwarfs fell suddenly on them.
"For the great sheet of winged whiteness broke up and fell as snow falls, and it fell upon the sealskin dwarfs; and every snowflake of it was a live, fluttering, hungry moth that buried its greedy nose deep in the sealskin fur."
"Grown-up people will tell you that it is not moths but moths' children who eat fur but this is only when they are trying to deceive you. When they are not thinking about you they say, ""I fear the moths have got at my ermine tippet,"" or, ""Your poor Aunt Emma had a lovely sable cloak, but it was eaten by moths."" And now there were more moths than have ever been together in this world before, all settling on the sealskin dwarfs."
"The dwarfs did not see their danger till it was too late. Then they called for camphor and bitter apple and oil of lavender and yellow soap and borax; and some of the dwarfs even started to get these things, but long before any of them could get to the chemist's, all was over. The moths ate and ate and ate till the sealskin dwarfs, being sealskin throughout, even to the empty hearts of them, were eaten down to the very life and they fell one by one on the snow and so came to their end. And all around the North Pole the snow was brown with their flat bare pelts."
"""Oh, thank you thank you, darling Arctic moth,"" cried Jane. ""You are good I do hope you haven't eaten enough to disagree with you afterward!"""
"Millions of moth voices answered, with laughter as soft as moth wings, ""We should be a poor set of fellows if we couldn't over eat ourselves once in a while to oblige a friend."""
"And off they all fluttered, and the white grouse flew off, and the sealskin dwarfs were all dead, and the fires went out, and George and Jane were left alone in the dark with the dragon!"
"""Oh, dear,"" said Jane, ""this is the worst of all!"""
"""We've no friends left to help us,"" said George. He never thought that the dragon himself might help them but then that was an idea that would never have occurred to any boy."
"It grew colder and colder and colder, and even under the grouse feathers the children shivered."
"Then, when it was so cold that it could not manage to be any colder without breaking the thermometer, it stopped. And then the dragon uncurled himself from around the North Pole, and stretched his long, icy length over the snow, and said: ""This is something like! How faint those fires did make me feel!"""
"The fact was, the sealskin dwarfs had gone the wrong way to work: The dragon had been frozen so long that now he was nothing but solid ice all through, and the fires only made him feel as if he were going to die."
"But when the fires were out he felt quite well, and very hungry. He looked around for something to eat. But he never noticed George and Jane, because they were frozen to his back."
"He moved slowly off, and the snow-wreaths that bound the children to the Pole gave way with a snap, and there was the dragon, crawling south with Jane and George on his great, scaly, icy shining back. Of course the dragon had to go south if he went anywhere, because when you get to the North Pole there is no other way to go. The dragon rattled and tinkled as he went, exactly like the cut-glass chandelier when you touch it, as you are strictly forbidden to do. Of course there are a million ways of going south from the North Pole so you will own that it was lucky for George and Jane when the dragon took the right way and suddenly got his heavy feet on the great slide. Off he went, full speed, between the starry lamps, toward Forest Hill and the Crystal Palace."
"""Beware,"" continued the prince, ""lest you do that which afterwards you would give your life not to have done."""
"By the time the prince had concluded this story it was nearly morning, and he went away, after rewarding the man."
The prince then visited the country belonging to his brother-in-law.
"He disguised himself as a jogi, and sitting down by a tree near the palace, pretended to be absorbed in worship. News of the man and of his wonderful piety reached the ears of the king. He felt interested in him, as his wife was very ill; and he had sought for hakims to cure her, but in vain. He thought that, perhaps, this holy man could do something for her. So he sent to him. But the jogi refused to tread the halls of a king, saying that his dwelling was the open air, and that if his Majesty wished to see him he must come himself and bring his wife to the place. Then the king took his wife and brought her to the jogi. The holy man bade her prostrate herself before him, and when she had remained in this position for about three hours, he told her to rise and go, for she was cured."
"In the evening there was great consternation in the palace, because the queen had lost her pearl rosary, and nobody knew anything about it. At length some one went to the jogi, and found it on the ground by the place where the queen had prostrated herself. When the king heard this he was very angry, and ordered the jogi to be executed. This stern order, however, was not carried out, as the prince bribed the men and escaped from the country. But he knew that the second bit of advice was true."
"Clad in his own clothes, the prince was walking along one day when he saw a potter crying and laughing alternately with his wife and children. ""O fool,"" said he, ""what is the matter? If you laugh, why do you weep? If you weep, why do you laugh?"""
"""Do not bother me,"" said the potter. ""What does it matter to you?"""
"""Pardon me,"" said the prince, ""but I should like to know the reason."""
"""The reason is this, then,"" said the potter. ""The king of this country has a daughter whom he is obliged to marry every day, because all her husbands die the first night of their stay with her. Nearly all the young men of the place have thus perished, and our son will be called on soon. We laugh at the absurdity of the thing a potter's son marrying a princess, and we cry at the terrible consequence of the marriage. What can we do?"""
"""Truly a matter for laughing and weeping. But weep no more,"" said the prince. ""I will exchange places with your son, and will be married to the princess instead of him. Only give me suitable garments, and prepare me for the occasion."""
"So the potter gave him beautiful raiment and ornaments, and the prince went to the palace. At night he was conducted to the apartment of the princess. ""Dread hour!"" thought he; ""am I to die like the scores of young men before me?"" He clenched his sword with firm grip, and lay down on his bed, intending to keep awake all the night and see what would happen. In the middle of the night he saw two Shahmars come out from the nostrils of the princess. They stole over towards him, intending to kill him, like the others who had been before him: but he was ready for them. He laid hold of his sword, and when the snakes reached his bed he struck at them and killed them. In the morning the king came as usual to inquire, and was surprised to hear his daughter and the prince talking gaily together. ""Surely,"" said he, ""this man must be her husband, as he only can live with her."""
"""Where do you come from? Who are you?"" asked the king, entering the room."
"""O king!"" replied the prince, ""I am the son of a king who rules over such-and-such a country."""
"When he heard this the king was very glad, and bade the prince to abide in his palace, and appointed him his successor to the throne."
"The prince remained at the palace for more than a year, and then asked permission to visit his own country, which was granted. The king gave him elephants, horses, jewels, and abundance of money for the expenses of the way and as presents for his father, and the prince started."
"On the way he had to pass through the country belonging to his brother-in-law, whom we have already mentioned. Report of his arrival reached the ears of the king, who came with rope-tied hands and haltered neck to do him homage. He most humbly begged him to stay at his palace, and to accept what little hospitality could be provided."
"Some of the sufferings of the Pilgrims at the time are depicted on the preceding pages by the artist, also a few they escaped."
"Looking over the lives of our forefathers who came from England, I am not surprised that, with all the English people who have recently come to this country, I have never seen a forefather."

CHAPTER V.
DRAWBACKS OF BEING A COLONIST.
"It was at this period in the history of our country that the colonists found themselves not only banished from all civilization, but compelled to fight an armed foe whose trade was war and whose music was the dying wail of a tortured enemy. Unhampered by the exhausting efforts of industry, the Indian, trained by centuries of war upon adjoining tribes, felt himself foot-loose and free to shoot the unprotected forefather from behind the very stump fence his victim had worked so hard to erect."
"King Philip, a demonetized sovereign, organized his red troops, and, carrying no haversacks, knapsacks, or artillery, fell upon the colonists and killed them, only to reappear at some remote point while the dead and wounded who fell at the first point were being buried or cared for by rude physicians."
"What an era in the history of a country! Gentlewomen whose homes had been in the peaceful hamlets of England lived and died in the face of a cruel foe, yet prepared the cloth and clothing for their families, fed them, and taught them to look to God in all times of trouble, to be prayerful in their daily lives, yet vigilant and ready to deal death to the general enemy. They were the mothers whose sons and grandsons laid the huge foundations of a great nation and cemented them with their blood."
At this time there was a line of battle three hundred miles in length.
"On one side the white man went armed to the field or the prayer-meeting, shooting an Indian on sight as he would a panther; on the other, a foe whose wife did the chores and hoed the scattering crops while he made war and extermination his joy by night and his prayer and life-long purpose by day."
"Finally, however, the victory came sluggishly to the brave and deserving. One thousand Indians were killed at one pop, and their wigwams were burned. All their furniture and curios were burned in their wigwams, and some of their valuable dogs were holocausted. King Philip was shot by a follower as he was looking under the throne for something, and peace was for the time declared."
"About 1684 the Colony of Massachusetts, which had dared to open up a trade with the West Indies, using its own vessels for that purpose, was hauled over the coals by the mother-country for violation of the Navigation Act, and an officer sent over to enforce the latter. The colonists defied him, and when he was speaking to them publicly in a tone of reprimand, he got an ovation in the way of eggs and codfish, both of which had been set aside for that purpose when the country was new, and therefore had an air of antiquity which cannot be successfully imitated."
"As a result, the Colony was made a royal appendage, and Sir Edmund Andros, a political hack under James II., was made Governor of New England. He reigned under great difficulties for three years, and then suddenly found himself in jail. The jail was so arranged that he could not get out, and so the Puritans now quietly resumed their old form of government."
"This continued also for three years, when Sir William Phipps became Governor under the crown, with one hundred and twenty pounds per annum and house-rent."
"One eye, sleepest thou?”"
"until One-eye shut her one eye, and fell asleep, and as soon as Two-eyes saw that One-eye was fast asleep, and could discover nothing, she said,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and seated herself at her table, and ate and drank until she was satisfied, and then she again cried,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and in an instant all was gone. Two-eyes now awakened One-eye, and said, “One-eye, you want to take care of the goat, and go to sleep while you are doing it, and in the meantime the goat might run all over the world. Come, let us go home again.” So they went home, and again Two-eyes let her little dish stand untouched, and One-eye could not tell her mother why she would not eat it, and to excuse herself said, “I fell asleep when I was out.”"
"Next day the mother said to Three-eyes, “This time thou shalt go and observe if Two-eyes eats anything when she is out, and if any one fetches her food and drink, for she must eat and drink in secret.” So Three-eyes went to Two-eyes, and said, “I will go with you and see if the goat is taken proper care of, and driven where there is food.” But Two-eyes knew what was in Three-eyes’ mind, and drove the goat into high grass and said, “We will sit down, and I will sing something to you, Three-eyes.” Three-eyes sat down and was tired with the walk and with the heat of the sun, and Two-eyes began the same song as before, and sang,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?”"
"but then, instead of singing,"
"“Three eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"as she ought to have done, she thoughtlessly sang,"
"“Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"and sang all the time,"
"“Three eyes, are you waking?"
"Two eyes, are you sleeping?”"
"Then two of the eyes which Three-eyes had, shut and fell asleep, but the third, as it had not been named in the song, did not sleep. It is true that Three-eyes shut it, but only in her cunning, to pretend it was asleep too, but it blinked, and could see everything very well. And when Two-eyes thought that Three-eyes was fast asleep, she used her little charm,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and ate and drank as much as her heart desired, and then ordered the table to go away again,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and Three-eyes had seen everything. Then Two-eyes came to her, waked her and said, “Have you been asleep, Three-eyes? You are a good care-taker! Come, we will go home.” And when they got home, Two-eyes again did not eat, and Three-eyes said to the mother, “Now, I know why that high-minded thing there does not eat. When she is out, she says to the goat,"
"“Bleat, my little goat, bleat, Cover the table with something to eat,”"
"and then a little table appears before her covered with the best of food, much better than any we have here, and when she has eaten all she wants, she says,"
"“Bleat, bleat, my little goat, I pray, And take the table quite away,”"
"and all disappears. I watched everything closely. She put two of my eyes to sleep by using a certain form of words, but luckily the one in my forehead kept awake.” Then the envious mother cried, “Dost thou want to fare better than we do? The desire shall pass away,” and she fetched a butcher’s knife, and thrust it into the heart of the goat, which fell down dead."
"When Two-eyes saw that, she went out full of trouble, seated herself on the ridge of grass at the edge of the field, and wept bitter tears."
"Suddenly the wise woman once more stood by her side, and said, “Two-eyes, why art thou weeping?” “Have I not reason to weep?” she answered. “The goat which covered the table for me every day when I spoke your charm, has been killed by my mother, and now I shall again have to bear hunger and want.” The wise woman said, “Two-eyes, I will give thee a piece of good advice; ask thy sisters to give thee the entrails of the slaughtered goat, and bury them in the ground in front of the house, and thy fortune will be made.” Then she vanished, and Two-eyes went home and said to her sisters, “Dear sisters, do give me some part of my goat; I don’t wish for what is good, but give me the entrails.” Then they laughed and said, “If that’s all you want, you can have it.” So Two-eyes took the entrails and buried them quietly in the evening, in front of the house-door, as the wise woman had counselled her to do."
"Next morning, when they all awoke, and went to the house-door, there stood a strangely magnificent tree with leaves of silver, and fruit of gold hanging among them, so that in all the wide world there was nothing more beautiful or precious. They did not know how the tree could have come there during the night, but Two-eyes saw that it had grown up out of the entrails of the goat, for it was standing on the exact spot where she had buried them. Then the mother said to One-eye, “Climb up, my child, and gather some of the fruit of the tree for us.”"
"One-eye climbed up, but when she was about to get hold of one of the golden apples, the branch escaped from her hands, and that happened each time, so that she could not pluck a single apple, let her do what she might. Then said the mother, “Three-eyes, do you climb up; you with your three eyes can look about you better than One-eye.” One-eye slipped down, and Three-eyes climbed up. Three-eyes was not more skilful, and might search as she liked, but the golden apples always escaped her. At length the mother grew impatient, and climbed up herself, but could get hold of the fruit no better than One-eye and Three-eyes, for she always clutched empty air. Then said Two-eyes, “I will just go up, perhaps I may succeed better.” The sisters cried, “You indeed, with your two eyes, what can you do?” But Two-eyes climbed up, and the golden apples did get out of her way, but came into her hand of their own accord, so that she could pluck them one after the other, and brought a whole apronful down with her. The mother took them away from her, and instead of treating poor Two-eyes any better for this, she and One-eye and Three-eyes were only envious, because Two-eyes alone had been able to get the fruit, and they treated her still more cruelly."
"It so befell that once when they were all standing together by the tree, a young knight came up. “Quick, Two-eyes,” cried the two sisters, “creep under this, and don’t disgrace us!” and with all speed they turned an empty barrel which was standing close by the tree over poor Two-eyes, and they pushed the golden apples which she had been gathering, under it too. When the knight came nearer he was a handsome lord, who stopped and admired the magnificent gold and silver tree, and said to the two sisters, “To whom does this fine tree belong? Any one who would bestow one branch of it on me might in return for it ask whatsoever he desired.” Then One-eye and Three-eyes replied that the tree belonged to them, and that they would give him a branch. They both took great trouble, but they were not able to do it, for the branches and fruit both moved away from them every time. Then said the knight, “It is very strange that the tree should belong to you, and that you should still not be able to break a piece off.” They again asserted that the tree was their property. Whilst they were saying so, Two-eyes rolled out a couple of golden apples from under the barrel to the feet of the knight, for she was vexed with One-eye and Three-eyes, for not speaking the truth. When the knight saw the apples he was astonished, and asked where they came from. One-eye and Three-eyes answered that they had another sister, who was not allowed to show herself, for she had only two eyes like any common person. The knight, however, desired to see her, and cried, “Two-eyes, come forth.” Then Two-eyes, quite comforted, came from beneath the barrel, and the knight was surprised at her great beauty, and said, “Thou, Two-eyes, canst certainly break off a branch from the tree for me.” “Yes,” replied Two-eyes, “that I certainly shall be able to do, for the tree belongs to me.” And she climbed up, and with the greatest ease broke off a branch with beautiful silver leaves and golden fruit, and gave it to the knight."
"Then said the knight, “Two-eyes, what shall I give thee for it?”"
"“Alas!” answered Two-eyes, “I suffer from hunger and thirst, grief and want, from early morning till late night; if you would take me with you, and deliver me from these things, I should be happy.” So the knight lifted Two-eyes on to his horse, and took her home with him to his father’s castle, and there he gave her beautiful clothes, and meat and drink to her heart’s content, and as he loved her so much he married her, and the wedding was solemnized with great rejoicing. When Two-eyes was thus carried away by the handsome knight, her two sisters grudged her good fortune in downright earnest. “The wonderful tree, however, still remains with us,” thought they, “and even if we can gather no fruit from it, still every one will stand still and look at it, and come to us and admire it. Who knows what good things may be in store for us?” But next morning, the tree had vanished, and all their hopes were at an end. And when Two-eyes looked out of the window of her own little room, to her great delight it was standing in front of it, and so it had followed her."
"Two-eyes lived a long time in happiness. Once two poor women came to her in her castle, and begged for alms. She looked in their faces, and recognized her sisters, One-eye, and Three-eyes, who had fallen into such poverty that they had to wander about and beg their bread from door to door. Two-eyes, however, made them welcome, and was kind to them, and took care of them, so that they both with all their hearts repented the evil that they had done their sister in their youth."
157 The Sparrow And His Four Children
"A sparrow had four young ones in a swallow’s nest. When they were fledged, some naughty boys pulled out the nest, but fortunately all the birds got safely away in the high wind. Then the old bird was grieved that as his sons had all gone out into the world, he had not first warned them of every kind of danger, and given them good instruction how to deal with each. In the autumn a great many sparrows assembled together in a wheatfield, and there the old bird met his four children again, and full of joy took them home with him. “Ah, my dear sons, what pain I have been in about you all through the summer, because you got away in the wind without my teaching; listen to my words, obey your father, and be well on your guard. Little birds have to encounter great dangers!” And then he asked the eldest where he had spent the summer, and how he had supported himself? “I stayed in the gardens, and looked for caterpillars and small worms, until the cherries got ripe.” “Ah, my son,” said the father, “tit-bits are not bad, but there is great risk about them; on that account take great care of thyself henceforth, and particularly when people are going about the gardens who carry long green poles which are hollow inside and have a little hole at the top.”"
"“Yes, father, but what if a little green leaf is stuck over the hole with wax?” said the son. “Where hast thou seen that?” “In a merchant’s garden,” said the youngster. “Oh, my son, merchant folks are quick folks,” said the father. “If thou hast been among the children of the world, thou hast learned worldly shiftiness enough, only see that thou usest it well, and do not be too confident.” After this he asked the next, “Where hast thou passed thy time?” “At court,” said the son."
"“Sparrows and silly little birds are of no use in that place—there one finds much gold, velvet, silk, armour, harnesses, sparrow-hawks, screech-owls and hen-harriers; keep to the horses’ stable where they winnow oats, or thresh, and then fortune may give thee thy daily grain of corn in peace.” “Yes, father,” said the son, “but when the stable-boys make traps and fix their gins and snares in the straw, many a one is caught fast.” “Where hast thou seen that?” said the old bird."
"“At court, among the stable-boys.” “Oh, my son, court boys are bad boys! If thou hast been to court and among the lords, and hast left no feathers there, thou hast learnt a fair amount, and wilt know very well how to go about the world, but look around thee and above thee, for the wolves devour the wisest dogs.” The father examined the third also:"
"“Where didst thou seek thy safety?” “I have broken up tubs and ropes on the cart-roads and highways, and sometimes met with a grain of corn or barley.” “That is indeed dainty fare,” said the father, “but take care what thou art about and look carefully around, especially when thou seest any one stooping and about to pick up a stone, there is not much time to stay then.” “That is true,” said the son, “but what if any one should carry a bit of rock, or ore, ready beforehand in his breast or pocket?” “Where hast thou seen that?” “Among the mountaineers, dear father; when they go out, they generally take little bits of ore with them.” “Mountain folks are working folks, and clever folks. If thou hast been among mountain lads, thou hast seen and learnt something, but when thou goest thither beware, for many a sparrow has been brought to a bad end by a mountain boy.” At length the father came to the youngest son: “Thou, my dear chirping nestling, wert always the silliest and weakest; stay with me, the world has many rough, wicked birds which have crooked beaks and long claws, and lie in wait for poor little birds and swallow them. Keep with those of thine own kind, and pick up little spiders and caterpillars from the trees, or the house, and then thou wilt live long in peace.” “My dear father, he who feeds himself without injury to other people fares well, and no sparrow-hawk, eagle, or kite will hurt him if he specially commits himself and his lawful food, evening and morning, faithfully to God, who is the Creator and Preserver of all forest and village birds, who likewise heareth the cry and prayer of the young ravens, for no sparrow or wren ever falls to the ground except by his will.” “Where hast thou learnt this?” The son answered, “When the great blast of wind tore me away from thee I came to a church, and there during the summer I have picked up the flies and spiders from the windows, and heard this discourse preached. The Father of all sparrows fed me all the summer through, and kept me from all mischance and from ferocious birds.”"
"“In sooth, my dear son, if thou takest refuge in the churches and helpest to clear away spiders and buzzing flies, and criest unto God like the young ravens, and commendest thyself to the eternal Creator, all will be well with thee, and that even if the whole world were full of wild malicious birds.”"
"“He who to God commits his ways, In silence suffers, waits, and prays, Preserves his faith and conscience pure, He is of God’s protection sure.”"
158 The Story of Schlauraffen Land
"In the time of Schlauraffen I went there, and saw Rome and the Lateran hanging by a small silken thread, and a man without feet who outran a swift horse, and a keen sharp sword that cut through a bridge. There I saw a young ass with a silver nose which pursued two fleet hares, and a lime-tree that was very large, on which hot cakes were growing. There I saw a lean old goat which carried about a hundred cart-loads of fat on his body, and sixty loads of salt. Have I not told enough lies? There I saw a plough ploughing without horse or cow, and a child of one year threw four millstones from Ratisbon to Treves, and from Treves to Strasburg, and a hawk swam over the Rhine, which he had a perfect right to do. There I heard some fishes begin to make such a disturbance with each other, that it resounded as far as heaven, and sweet honey flowed like water from a deep valley at the top of a high mountain, and these were strange things. There were two crows which were mowing a meadow, and I saw two gnats building a bridge, and two doves tore a wolf to pieces; two children brought forth two kids, and two frogs threshed corn together. There I saw two mice consecrating a bishop, and two cats scratching out a bear’s tongue. Then a snail came running up and killed two furious lions. There stood a barber and shaved a woman’s beard off; and two sucking-children bade their mother hold her tongue. There I saw two greyhounds which brought a mill out of the water; and a sorry old horse was beside it, and said it was right. And four horses were standing in the yard threshing corn with all their might, and two goats were heating the stove, and a red cow shot the bread into the oven."
"Then a cock crowed, Cock-a-doodle-doo! The story is all told,—Cock-a-doodle-doo!"
159 The Ditmarsch Tale of Wonders
"I will tell you something. I saw two roasted fowls flying; they flew quickly and had their breasts turned to heaven and their backs to hell, and an anvil and a mill-stone swam across the Rhine prettily, slowly, and gently, and a frog sat on the ice at Whitsuntide and ate a ploughshare. Three fellows who wanted to catch a hare, went on crutches and stilts; one of them was deaf, the second blind, the third dumb, and the fourth could not stir a step. Do you want to know how it was done?"
"First, the blind man saw the hare running across the field, the dumb one called to the lame one, and the lame one seized it by the neck."
"There were certain men who wished to sail on dry land, and they set their sails in the wind, and sailed away over great fields. Then they sailed over a high mountain, and there they were miserably drowned. A crab was chasing a hare which was running away at full speed, and high up on the roof lay a cow which had climbed up there. In that country the flies are as big as the goats are here. Open the window, that the lies may fly out."
160 A Riddling Tale
"Three women were changed into flowers which grew in the field, but one of them was allowed to be in her own home at night. Then once when day was drawing near, and she was forced to go back to her companions in the field and become a flower again, she said to her husband, “If thou wilt come this afternoon and gather me, I shall be set free and henceforth stay with thee.” And he did so. Now the question is, how did her husband know her, for the flowers were exactly alike, and without any difference? Answer: as she was at her home during the night and not in the field, no dew fell on her as it did on the others, and by this her husband knew her."
161 Snow-White and Rose-Red
"There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red. They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home with her mother, and helped her with her house-work, or read to her when there was nothing to do."
"The two children were so fond of each another that they always held each other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said, “We will not leave each other,” Rose-red answered, “Never so long as we live,” and their mother would add, “What one has she must share with the other.”"
"They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon the boughs, and sang whatever they knew."
"No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss, and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and had no distress on their account."
"Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing and went away into the forest. And when they looked round they found that they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who watches over good children."
"Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the wrekin."
"The kettle was of copper and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said, “Go, Snow-white, and bolt the door,” and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls listened as they sat and span. And close by them lay a lamb upon the floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head hidden beneath its wings."
"One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, some one knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said, “Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking shelter.” Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black head within the door."
"Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered, and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began to speak and said, “Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm!"
"I am half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.”"
"“Poor bear,” said the mother, “lie down by the fire, only take care that you do not burn your coat.” Then she cried, “Snow-white, Rose-red, come out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.” So they both came out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid of him. The bear said, “Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a little;” so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean; and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands, put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called out, “Leave me alive, children,"
"“Snowy-white, Rosy-red, Will you beat your lover dead?”"
"When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the bear, “You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from the cold and the bad weather.” As soon as day dawned the two children let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest."
"Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were never fastened until their black friend had arrived."
"And she sat down again in the field and began to comb out her hair, and Conrad ran and tried to clutch it, so she said in haste,"
"“Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say, Blow Conrad’s little hat away, And make him chase it here and there, Until I have braided all my hair, And bound it up again.”"
"Then the wind blew, and blew his little hat off his head and far away, and Conrad was forced to run after it, and when he came back, her hair had been put up a long time, and he could get none of it, and so they looked after their geese till evening came."
"But in the evening after they had got home, Conrad went to the old King, and said, “I won’t tend the geese with that girl any longer!”"
"“Why not?” inquired the aged King. “Oh, because she vexes me the whole day long.” Then the aged King commanded him to relate what it was that she did to him. And Conrad said, “In the morning when we pass beneath the dark gateway with the flock, there is a sorry horse’s head on the wall, and she says to it,"
"“Alas, Falada, hanging there!”"
"And the head replies,"
"“Alas, young Queen how ill you fare!"
"If this your tender mother knew, Her heart would surely break in two.”"
"And Conrad went on to relate what happened on the goose pasture, and how when there he had to chase his hat."
"The aged King commanded him to drive his flock out again next day, and as soon as morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gateway, and heard how the maiden spoke to the head of Falada, and then he too went into the country, and hid himself in the thicket in the meadow. There he soon saw with his own eyes the goose-girl and the goose-boy bringing their flock, and how after a while she sat down and unplaited her hair, which shone with radiance. And soon she said,"
"“Blow, blow, thou gentle wind, I say, Blow Conrad’s little hat away, And make him chase it here and there, Until I have braided all my hair, And bound it up again.”"
"Then came a blast of wind and carried off Conrad’s hat, so that he had to run far away, while the maiden quietly went on combing and plaiting her hair, all of which the King observed. Then, quite unseen, he went away, and when the goose-girl came home in the evening, he called her aside, and asked why she did all these things. “I may not tell you that, and I dare not lament my sorrows to any human being, for I have sworn not to do so by the heaven which is above me; if I had not done that, I should have lost my life.” He urged her and left her no peace, but he could draw nothing from her. Then said he, “If thou wilt not tell me anything, tell thy sorrows to the iron-stove there,” and he went away. Then she crept into the iron-stove, and began to weep and lament, and emptied her whole heart, and said, “Here am I deserted by the whole world, and yet I am a King’s daughter, and a false waiting-maid has by force brought me to such a pass that I have been compelled to put off my royal apparel, and she has taken my place with my bridegroom, and I have to perform menial service as a goose-girl. If my mother did but know that, her heart would break.”"
"The aged King, however, was standing outside by the pipe of the stove, and was listening to what she said, and heard it. Then he came back again, and bade her come out of the stove. And royal garments were placed on her, and it was marvellous how beautiful she was! The aged King summoned his son, and revealed to him that he had got the false bride who was only a waiting-maid, but that the true one was standing there, as the sometime goose-girl. The young King rejoiced with all his heart when he saw her beauty and youth, and a great feast was made ready to which all the people and all good friends were invited. At the head of the table sat the bridegroom with the King’s daughter at one side of him, and the waiting-maid on the other, but the waiting-maid was blinded, and did not recognize the princess in her dazzling array."
"When they had eaten and drunk, and were merry, the aged King asked the waiting-maid as a riddle, what a person deserved who had behaved in such and such a way to her master, and at the same time related the whole story, and asked what sentence such an one merited? Then the false bride said, “She deserves no better fate than to be stripped entirely naked, and put in a barrel which is studded inside with pointed nails, and two white horses should be harnessed to it, which will drag her along through one street after another, till she is dead.” “It is thou,” said the aged King, “and thou hast pronounced thine own sentence, and thus shall it be done unto thee.” And when the sentence had been carried out, the young King married his true bride, and both of them reigned over their kingdom in peace and happiness."
90 The Young Giant
"Once on a time a countryman had a son who was as big as a thumb, and did not become any bigger, and during several years did not grow one hair’s breadth. Once when the father was going out to plough, the little one said, “Father, I will go out with you.” “Thou wouldst go out with me?” said the father. “Stay here, thou wilt be of no use out there, besides thou mightest get lost!” Then Thumbling began to cry, and for the sake of peace his father put him in his pocket, and took him with him. When he was outside in the field, he took him out again, and set him in a freshly-cut furrow. Whilst he was there, a great giant came over the hill. “Do thou see that great bogie?” said the father, for he wanted to frighten the little fellow to make him good; “he is coming to fetch thee.” The giant, however, had scarcely taken two steps with his long legs before he was in the furrow. He took up little Thumbling carefully with two fingers, examined him, and without saying one word went away with him. His father stood by, but could not utter a sound for terror, and he thought nothing else but that his child was lost, and that as long as he lived he should never set eyes on him again."
"The giant, however, carried him home, suckled him, and Thumbling grew and became tall and strong after the manner of giants. When two years had passed, the old giant took him into the forest, wanted to try him, and said, “Pull up a stick for thyself.” Then the boy was already so strong that he tore up a young tree out of the earth by the roots. But the giant thought, “We must do better than that,” took him back again, and suckled him two years longer. When he tried him, his strength had increased so much that he could tear an old tree out of the ground."
"That was still not enough for the giant; he again suckled him for two years, and when he then went with him into the forest and said, “Now just tear up a proper stick for me,” the boy tore up the strongest oak-tree from the earth, so that it split, and that was a mere trifle to him. “Now that will do,” said the giant, “thou art perfect,” and took him back to the field from whence he had brought him. His father was there following the plough. The young giant went up to him, and said, “Does my father see what a fine man his son has grown into?”"
"The farmer was alarmed, and said, “No, thou art not my son; I don’t want thee leave me!” “Truly I am your son; allow me to do your work, I can plough as well as you, nay better.” “No, no, thou art not my son; and thou canst not plough go away!” However, as he was afraid of this great man, he left go of the plough, stepped back and stood at one side of the piece of land. Then the youth took the plough, and just pressed it with one hand, but his grasp was so strong that the plough went deep into the earth. The farmer could not bear to see that, and called to him, “If thou art determined to plough, thou must not press so hard on it, that makes bad work.” The youth, however, unharnessed the horses, and drew the plough himself, saying, “Just go home, father, and bid my mother make ready a large dish of food, and in the meantime I will go over the field.” Then the farmer went home, and ordered his wife to prepare the food; but the youth ploughed the field which was two acres large, quite alone, and then he harnessed himself to the harrow, and harrowed the whole of the land, using two harrows at once. When he had done it, he went into the forest, and pulled up two oak-trees, laid them across his shoulders, and hung on them one harrow behind and one before, and also one horse behind and one before, and carried all as if it had been a bundle of straw, to his parents’ house. When he entered the yard, his mother did not recognize him, and asked, “Who is that horrible tall man?” The farmer said, “That is our son.” She said, “No that cannot be our son, we never had such a tall one, ours was a little thing.” She called to him, “Go away, we do not want thee!” The youth was silent, but led his horses to the stable, gave them some oats and hay, and all that they wanted. When he had done this, he went into the parlour, sat down on the bench and said, “Mother, now I should like something to eat, will it soon be ready?” Then she said, “Yes,” and brought in two immense dishes full of food, which would have been enough to satisfy herself and her husband for a week. The youth, however, ate the whole of it himself, and asked if she had nothing more to set before him. “No,” she replied, “that is all we have.” “But that was only a taste, I must have more.” She did not dare to oppose him, and went and put a huge caldron full of food on the fire, and when it was ready, carried it in. “At length come a few crumbs,” said he, and ate all there was, but it was still not sufficient to appease his hunger. Then said he, “Father, I see well that with you I shall never have food enough; if you will get me an iron staff which is strong, and which I cannot break against my knees, I will go out into the world.”"
"The farmer was glad, put his two horses in his cart, and fetched from the smith a staff so large and thick, that the two horses could only just bring it away. The youth laid it across his knees, and snap! he broke it in two in the middle like a bean-stalk, and threw it away. The father then harnessed four horses, and brought a bar which was so long and thick, that the four horses could only just drag it. The son snapped this also in twain against his knees, threw it away, and said, “Father, this can be of no use to me, you must harness more horses, and bring a stronger staff.” So the father harnessed eight horses, and brought one which was so long and thick, that the eight horses could only just carry it. When the son took it in his hand, he broke off a bit from the top of it also, and said, “Father, I see that you will not be able to procure me any such staff as I want, I will remain no longer with you.”"
"So he went away, and gave out that he was a smith’s apprentice. He arrived at a village, wherein lived a smith who was a greedy fellow, who never did a kindness to any one, but wanted everything for himself."
The youth went into the smithy and asked if he needed a journeyman.
"“Yes,” said the smith, and looked at him, and thought, “That is a strong fellow who will strike out well, and earn his bread.” So he asked, “How much wages dost thou want?” “I don’t want any at all,” he replied, “only every fortnight, when the other journeymen are paid, I will give thee two blows, and thou must bear them.” The miser was heartily satisfied, and thought he would thus save much money. Next morning, the strange journeyman was to begin to work, but when the master brought the glowing bar, and the youth struck his first blow, the iron flew asunder, and the anvil sank so deep into the earth, that there was no bringing it out again. Then the miser grew angry, and said, “Oh, but I can’t make any use of you, you strike far too powerfully; what will you have for the one blow?”"
"Then said he, “I will only give you quite a small blow, that’s all.”"
"And he raised his foot, and gave him such a kick that he flew away over four loads of hay. Then he sought out the thickest iron bar in the smithy for himself, took it as a stick in his hand and went onwards."
"When he had walked for some time, he came to a small farm, and asked the bailiff if he did not require a head-servant. “Yes,” said the bailiff, “I can make use of one; you look a strong fellow who can do something, how much a year do you want as wages?” He again replied that he wanted no wages at all, but that every year he would give him three blows, which he must bear. Then the bailiff was satisfied, for he, too, was a covetous fellow. Next morning all the servants were to go into the wood, and the others were already up, but the head-servant was still in bed. Then one of them called to him, “Get up, it is time; we are going into the wood, and thou must go with us.” “Ah,” said he quite roughly and surlily, “you may just go, then; I shall be back again before any of you.” Then the others went to the bailiff, and told him that the head-man was still lying in bed, and would not go into the wood with them. The bailiff said they were to awaken him again, and tell him to harness the horses. The head-man, however, said as before, “Just go there, I shall be back again before any of you.” And then he stayed in bed two hours longer. At length he arose from the feathers, but first he got himself two bushels of peas from the loft, made himself some broth with them, ate it at his leisure, and when that was done, went and harnessed the horses, and drove into the wood. Not far from the wood was a ravine through which he had to pass, so he first drove the horses on, and then stopped them, and went behind the cart, took trees and brushwood, and made a great barricade, so that no horse could get through. When he was entering the wood, the others were just driving out of it with their loaded carts to go home; then said he to them, “Drive on, I will still get home before you do.” He did not drive far into the wood, but at once tore two of the very largest trees of all out of the earth, threw them on his cart, and turned round. When he came to the barricade, the others were still standing there, not able to get through. “Don’t you see,” said he, “that if you had stayed with me, you would have got home just as quickly, and would have had another hour’s sleep?” He now wanted to drive on, but his horses could not work their way through, so he unharnessed them, laid them on the top of the cart, took the shafts in his own hands, and pulled it all through, and he did this just as easily as if it had been laden with feathers. When he was over, he said to the others, “There, you see, I have got over quicker than you,” and drove on, and the others had to stay where they were. In the yard, however, he took a tree in his hand, showed it to the bailiff, and said, “Isn’t that a fine bundle of wood?” Then said the bailiff to his wife, “The servant is a good one, if he does sleep long, he is still home before the others.” So he served the bailiff for a year, and when that was over, and the other servants were getting their wages, he said it was time for him to take his too. The bailiff, however, was afraid of the blows which he was to receive, and earnestly entreated him to excuse him from having them; for rather than that, he himself would be head-servant, and the youth should be bailiff. “No,”"
"said he, “I will not be a bailiff, I am head-servant, and will remain so, but I will administer that which we agreed on.” The bailiff was willing to give him whatsoever he demanded, but it was of no use, the head-servant said no to everything. Then the bailiff did not know what to do, and begged for a fortnight’s delay, for he wanted to find some way of escape. The head-servant consented to this delay. The bailiff summoned all his clerks together, and they were to think the matter over, and give him advice. The clerks pondered for a long time, but at last they said that no one was sure of his life with the head-servant, for he could kill a man as easily as a midge, and that the bailiff ought to make him get into the well and clean it, and when he was down below, they would roll up one of the mill-stones which was lying there, and throw it on his head; and then he would never return to daylight."
"The advice pleased the bailiff, and the head-servant was quite willing to go down the well. When he was standing down below at the bottom, they rolled down the largest mill-stone and thought they had broken his skull, but he cried, “Chase away those hens from the well, they are scratching in the sand up there, and throwing the grains into my eyes, so that I can’t see.” So the bailiff cried, “Sh-sh,” and pretended to frighten the hens away. When the head-servant had finished his work, he climbed up and said, “Just look what a beautiful neck-tie I have on,”"
and behold it was the mill-stone which he was wearing round his neck.
"The head-servant now wanted to take his reward, but the bailiff again begged for a fortnight’s delay. The clerks met together and advised him to send the head-servant to the haunted mill to grind corn by night, for from thence as yet no man had ever returned in the morning alive."
"The proposal pleased the bailiff, he called the head-servant that very evening, and ordered him to take eight bushels of corn to the mill, and grind it that night, for it was wanted. So the head-servant went to the loft, and put two bushels in his right pocket, and two in his left, and took four in a wallet, half on his back, and half on his breast, and thus laden went to the haunted mill. The miller told him that he could grind there very well by day, but not by night, for the mill was haunted, and that up to the present time whosoever had gone into it at night had been found in the morning lying dead inside. He said, “I will manage it, just you go away to bed.” Then he went into the mill, and poured out the corn. About eleven o’clock he went into the miller’s room, and sat down on the bench. When he had sat there a while, a door suddenly opened, and a large table came in, and on the table, wine and roasted meats placed themselves, and much good food besides, but everything came of itself, for no one was there to carry it. After this the chairs pushed themselves up, but no people came, until all at once he beheld fingers, which handled knives and forks, and laid food on the plates, but with this exception he saw nothing. As he was hungry, and saw the food, he, too, place himself at the table, ate with those who were eating and enjoyed it. When he had had enough, and the others also had quite emptied their dishes, he distinctly heard all the candles being suddenly snuffed out, and as it was now pitch dark, he felt something like a box on the ear. Then he said, “If anything of that kind comes again, I shall strike out in return.” And when he had received a second box on the ear, he, too struck out. And so it continued the whole night. He took nothing without returning it, but repaid everything with interest, and did not lay about him in vain. At daybreak, however, everything ceased. When the miller had got up, he wanted to look after him, and wondered if he were still alive. Then the youth said, “I have eaten my fill, have received some boxes on the ears, but I have given some in return.” The miller rejoiced, and said that the mill was now released from the spell, and wanted to give him much money as a reward. But he said, “Money, I will not have, I have enough of it.” So he took his meal on his back, went home, and told the bailiff that he had done what he had been told to do, and would now have the reward agreed on. When the bailiff heard that, he was seriously alarmed and quite beside himself; he walked backwards and forwards in the room, and drops of perspiration ran down from his forehead. Then he opened the window to get some fresh air, but before he was aware, the head-servant had given him such a kick that he flew through the window out into the air, and so far away that no one ever saw him again. Then said the head-servant to the bailiff’s wife, “If he does not come back, you must take the other blow.” She cried, “No, no I cannot bear it,” and opened the other window, because drops of perspiration were running down her forehead. Then he gave her such a kick that she, too, flew out, and as she was lighter she went much higher than her husband. Her husband cried, “Do come to me,” but she replied, “Come thou to me, I cannot come to thee.” And they hovered about there in the air, and could not get to each other, and whether they are still hovering about, or not, I do not know, but the young giant took up his iron bar, and went on his way."

SHADES OF ORSON WELLS' MARTIAN
SCARE STALKS CAPITOL CORRIDORS.
Crane tossed the paper aside listlessly and picked up the second one:
SENATORS VOICE CONCERN FOR SANITY
OF COLLEAGUE
CRANE IN STUNNING TIRADE
WARNS OF SCIENCE-FICTION
DISASTER.
"The third paper featured an internationally syndicated columnist, famous"
for his biting wit:
*       *       *       *       *
Senator Crane today launched a one-man campaign to make America
space-conscious. If there was any Madison Avenue thinking behind the
launching it was certainly lower Madison Avenue.
In order to make his point--exactly what this was confused a vast
roomful of newspapermen--the Senator invented a race of creatures called
"androids. These androids, it seems, look exactly like Tom Smith down the"
block except that they'd just as soon cut your throat as not.
We fear the Senator must have been watching the wrong television
"shows--knives yet, ugh!--possibly _Jim Bowie_, because there wasn't a"
ray gun nor a disintegrator in his whole bag of exhibits.
"All in all, it would appear that the project was pointed toward making"
the people Senator Crane-conscious rather than aiming their attention at
"Askew’s little gloved hands trembled, and he turned white with"
anger--as pale as Montagu Askew allowed himself to turn:
"“It has belonged to my forefathers for seven generations,” he"
said--“and every man of them backed his acts with his sword.”
Noll laughed; shrugged his shoulders:
"“If your acts are hereditary, it is an excuse for you,” he said."
"The following morning, Rupert Greppel and a French cousin called upon"
Noll; and Rupert stiffly asked if he could refer him to two friends.
"“No,” said Noll--Doome was with him--“no--I do not associate with men"
who associate with Lord Montagu Askew.”
"Rupert Greppel paused, dumbfounded:"
"“I do not think you understand,” he said. “Lord Montagu Askew"
challenges you to fight him.”
"“Tell Lord Montagu Askew from me,” said Noll, “that I only brawl with"
men. Good-morning.”
The whisperings at the clubs are said to have hit Lord Montagu Askew
"harder than a pistol-bullet; but Lord Montagu, from lack of experience,"
is not an authority on being hit with pistol-bullets. He never takes
"part in ungentlemanly encounters where people are hit. Indeed, he"
"maintains a wondrous silence, except that he challenged Noll; and the"
jade-handled cane has joined the ancestors.
"If there is no such Marshal, then the Ship shall be in like Manner"
delivered up to the Principal Officer of Customs at the Port.
"The Ship shall remain in the Custody of the Marshal, or of such Officer,"
subject to the Orders of the Court.
[Sidenote: Bringing in of Ship Papers.]
"17. The Captors shall, with all practicable Speed after the Ship is"
"brought into Port, bring the Ship Papers into the Registry of the Court."
"The Officer in Command, or One of the Chief Officers of the Capturing"
"Ship, or some other Person who was present at the Capture, and saw the"
"Ship Papers delivered up or found on board, shall make Oath that they"
"are brought in as they were taken, without Fraud, Addition, Subduction,"
"or Alteration, or else shall account on Oath to the Satisfaction of the"
Court for the Absence or altered Condition of the Ship Papers or any of
them.
Where no Ship Papers are delivered up or found on board the captured
"Ship, the Officer in Command, or One of the Chief Officers of the"
"capturing Ship, or some other Person who was present at the Capture,"
shall make Oath to that Effect.

"shall issue, returnable within Twenty Days from the Service thereof,"
citing all Persons in general to show Cause why the captured Ship should

than it is in any of Croce's writings. We are probably touching here
"on one of the possible, and probable, lines of development of Croce's"
"philosophy; which, however, will not become actual until the historical"
"problems of the living nature shall not urge Croce himself, or one of"
"his successors, as powerfully as the problems of human history have"
"moved him. At present, with very rare exceptions, the students of"
the history of nature are occupied in transforming their historical
experience into classes and types and laws; but a time may come when
from the naturalistic constructions we shall be able more frequently
"to recreate the life of which these are but the dead spoils, the"
"accumulated vestiges, by the same process by which history re-kindles"
"the old chronicles into new, contemporary life. That such a development"
"is implied in Croce's own theory of history can hardly be questioned,"
"though, when realized, it will undoubtedly react on more than one point"
of Croce's logic.

Enter the name of a firm under the family name rather than the
"forename, and do not fill out the forenames: e.g., _Friedlander"
"und Sohn, Raphael_, not under _Raphael_; _Stokes, F. A. Co._, not"
"_Stokes, Frederick A. Co._"
The consulter is much more likely to remember the family than the
Christian name. Whether the Christian name is written at the end
"or thus, _Town (John)_ and _Bowers (Henry)_, all firms should be"
"arranged after all the other entries of the first family name, i.e.,"
_Friedlander und Sohn_ after all the _Friedlanders_.
"This rule might be extended to include corporations, colleges,"
"libraries, etc., whose legal names include forenames. Entry under a"
"forename, as _Silas Bronson Library_, and especially under initials, as"
"_T. B. Scott Public Library_, is awkward. But the public habit is not"
yet sufficiently settled to justify an exception.

interest.
CHAPTER XXIX.
"RELICS IN GENERAL, AND THE IRON CROWN OF LOMBARDY IN PARTICULAR."
"ROME, _December 23, 1902_."
I had heard of relics before. Years ago I had read Mark Twain's account
of the large piece of the true cross which he had seen in a church in
the Azores; and of another piece which he had seen in the Cathedral
"of Notre Dame in Paris, besides some nails of the true cross and a"
part of the crown of thorns; and of the marble chest in the Cathedral
"of San Lorenzo at Genoa, which he was told contained the ashes of St."
"John, and was wound about with the chain that had confined St. John"
when he was in prison; and of the interesting collection shown him in
"the Cathedral of Milan, including two of St. Paul's fingers and one"
"The English author had met a colleague, with whom he stayed behind"
"talking, and Marchmont remained in the “hall,” as if it did not seem to"
him proper for him to go to his wife’s rooms.
"Susanna’s rooms were very high, had balconies on the Via Veneto, and"
were almost opposite Queen Margherita’s palace. One overlooked the
"garden and could see the Queen Mother taking her walks, which is not"
without its importance for persons who live in a republic.
Susanna was most amiable to Laura; repeated to all of them her
invitation to come and see her again; and after they had all promised
"to see one another frequently, Cæsar and Laura went down to their"
"carriage, and took a turn on the Corso by twilight."
XIII. ESTHETICS AND DEMAGOGY
_SUSANNA AND THE YOUNGSTERS_
"From this meeting on, Cæsar noticed that Marchmont paid court to Laura"
"with much persistence. A light-hearted, coquettish woman, it pleased"
"Laura to be pursued by a person like this Englishman, young,"
"distinguished, and rich; but she was not prepared to yield. Her"
"bringing-up, her class-feelings impelled her to consider adultery a"
"heinous thing. Nor was divorce a solution for her, since accepting it"
would oblige her to cease being a Catholic and to quarrel irrevocably
with the Cardinal. Marchmont showed no discretion in the way he paid
"court to Laura; he cared nothing about his wife, and talked of her with"
profound contempt....
'Therefore I refuse to regard as hopeless the idea of an
"American-Anglo-Japanese alliance, guaranteeing the peaceful development"
of the vast resources of the Far East. Such an alliance exists
"essentially now--an alliance springing from cognate ideas, wishes,"
purposes and principles. This is the best possible foundation for that
formal compact which the evolution of industry and commerce seems to me
unmistakably to foreshadow.'

NOTE TO DIALOGUE V.
"Since the bulk of the present work went to press, I came across the"
following communication printed in the _Outlook_. I take the liberty of
"subjoining it herewith, without any vain intention of flaunting the"
virtues of my countrymen.--K.S.
JAPANESE CHARACTER
_To the Editor of the_ OUTLOOK
"SIR,--I have received during the last few weeks letters bearing such"
eloquent testimony to the nobility of Japanese character that I am
sending you some extracts in the hope of your publishing them. The
"letters are from a friend of mine, who with her husband has lived in"
"Yokohama for many years, and can therefore speak with considerable"
authority. The first extract is about the soldiers themselves--
"Mine you know is a busy life, and I found work among the military"
"A month later I received a letter from George, written in cipher, which I"
here give translated:--
"""DEAR FRIEND:"
"""I reached Paris three weeks ago and was received by Monsieur Le G."
"most graciously. Although I cannot give definite news, I hope for great"
"improvement in my fortune soon, and perhaps may write you more fully"
thereof before the week is spent.
"""Good fortune has but one meaning for me, of which you already know. I"
beg you to say to one that a letter from her hand would give me greater
"joy than she can know, and that I would now send one to her if I felt"
"safe in so doing. Please send all letters in cipher, addressed: 'Monsieur"
"le Blanc, in care of 'Sieur de Catanet, at the sign of the Double Arrow"
"on the Rue St. Antoine, counting nine doors from the street corner"
nearest the Bastile.'
"""Your friend,"
"""LE BLANC."""
"When George wrote that he hoped for good fortune, I knew he had"
"sound reason to expect it, for he was one who never permitted a mere"
"possibility to take the form of hope, nor hope, however assuring, to"
"take the aspect of certainty. Knowing this to be true, I found great"
"joy in the letter, and when I told Frances, she did not pause even to"
"give me one smile of thanks, but broke into a flood of tears and seemed"
to take great happiness in her tribulation.
"I told Frances that we should answer the letter at once, and suggested"
"that she have hers ready in my hands the following day, if she wished to"
"laid hold on fame while as yet deeming himself unfamous. It's curious,"
"but true, nevertheless, that very often the writers who thought least"
of themselves during their lifetime have become the most universally
"renowned after their deaths. Shakespeare, I dare say, had no very"
"exaggerated idea of the beauty of his own plays,--he seems to have"
"written just the best that was in him, without caring what anybody"
thought of it. And I believe that is the only way to succeed in the
"end."""
"""In the end!"" repeated Alwyn dreamily--""In the end, no worldly success"
"is worth attaining,--a few thousand years and the greatest are"
"forgotten!"""
"""Not the GREATEST,""--said Villiers warmly--""The greatest must always be"
"remembered."""
"""No, my friend!--Not even the greatest! Do you not think there must"
"have been great and wise and gifted men in Tyre, in Sidon, in Carthage,"
"in Babylon?--There are five men mentioned in Scripture, as being 'ready"
"to write swiftly'--Sarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Ariel--where is"
the no doubt admirable work done by these? Perhaps ... who knows? ...
"one of them was as great as Homer in genius,--we cannot tell!"""
"""True,--we cannot tell!"" responded Villiers meditatively--""But, Alwyn,"
if you persist in viewing things through such tremendous vistas of
"time, and in measuring the Future by the Past, then one may ask what is"
"the use of anything?"""
"""There IS no use in anything, except in the making of a strong,"
"persistent, steady effort after good,"" said Alwyn earnestly ... ""We men"
"are cast, as it were, between two swift currents, Wrong and"
"Right,--Self and God,--and it seems more easy to shut our eyes and"
"Jogues, Isaac, referred to, 73."
"Orange, Fort, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Rochelle, Bressani sent to, 73."
"Torture, Indian, Bressani by the Iroquois, 73."
ESCAPE OF BRESSANI                           73
"march of several days,--during which Bressani, in wading a rocky"
"stream, fell from exhaustion and was nearly drowned,--they reached"
an Iroquois town. It is needless to follow the revolting details
of the new torments that succeeded. They hung him by the feet
"with chains; placed food for their dogs on his naked body, that"
they might lacerate him as they ate; and at last had reduced his
emaciated frame to such a condition that even they themselves stood
"in horror of him. ""I could not have believed,"" he writes to his"
"Superior, ""that a man was so hard to kill."" He found among them"
"those who, from compassion or from a refinement of cruelty, fed"
"him, for he could not feed himself. They told him jestingly that"
they wished to fatten him before putting him to death.
The council that was to decide his fate met on the nineteenth of
"June, when to the prisoner's amazement, and, as it seemed, to their"
"own surprise, they resolved to spare his life. He was given, with"
"due ceremony, to an old woman, to take the place of a deceased"
"relative; but since he was as repulsive, in his mangled condition"
"as, by the Indian standard, he was useless, she sent her son"
"with him to Fort Orange, to sell him to the Dutch. With the same"
"humanity which they had shown in the case of Jogues, they gave a"

"who, shortly before his death, declared her to be “the only"
"woman in contemporary literature who knew how to write a novel,”"
and that her future work would be her best. Another eminent
"English critic, Dr. Robertson Nicholl, spoke for some of the"
best students of modern literature in saying:—
“Gertrude Atherton is the ablest woman writer of fiction
now living.”
"In her most notable novel, “The Conqueror,” Gertrude Atherton"
has chosen in “the true and romantic story of Alexander
Hamilton” a subject which would have attracted few woman
"writers, and has handled those parts of it with which many men"
have busied their brains in such a way that _The New York Times
Saturday Review_ remarked that it
“Holds more romance than nine-tenths of the imaginative
fiction of the day and more veracity than ninety-nine
hundredths of the history. She is master of her
material.”
“Certainly this country has produced no writer who approaches
"Mrs. Atherton,” says one critic, while another adds that to have"
so “re-created a great man as Mrs. Atherton has done in this
novel is to have written one’s own title to greatness.” All
alike regard it as “a thing apart” (_The Critic_); “a remarkable
"production, full of force, vigour, brains, and insight” (_Boston"
Herald_); “an entrancing book . . . brilliantly written”
(_Glasgow Herald_). “It is hardly too much to say that she has
invented a new kind of historical novel” is the comment of the
"_Athenæum_ (London), with the addition that “the experiment is a"
remarkable success.”
The patient arrived at the Base on the sixth day; he said he
expectorated some blood at the end of about ten minutes after
"being shot, and experienced a 'half-choking sensation.' A small"
quantity of phlegm and occasional clots had been expectorated
since. He had walked about a good deal; movement occasioned
"cough, and he became 'blown' very rapidly."
On admission there were signs of fluid in the lower third of
"the pleural cavity, but no general symptoms beyond an evening"
rise of temperature to an average of 99°. About the twentieth
"day the temperature commenced to rise, and on the twenty-third"
and four following evenings reached 102°. The fever was
"accompanied by some distress, and a well-marked increase in the"
physical signs of the presence of fluid in the chest. The pulse
"rose to 96, and the respirations considerably above the average"
"of 24, which was at first noted. A strictly expectant attitude"
"was maintained, and the temperature steadily fell in a curve"
"corresponding to the rise, gradually reaching the normal at the"
end of a week. The physical signs at the base steadily cleared
"up, and at the end of six weeks the patient returned to England"
convalescent.
CHAPTER XI
INJURIES TO THE ABDOMEN
Perhaps no chapter of military surgery was looked forward to with more
eager interest than that dealing with wounds of the abdomen. In none was
very few cases where M. Léonce de Brotonne's still more recent edition
"is cited under his name. By ""F.O.,"" France, No.----, and ""F.O.,"""
"Prussia, No.----, are meant the volumes of _our_ Foreign Office"
despatches relating to France and Prussia. For the sake of brevity I
"have called Napoleon's Marshals and high officials by their names, not"
by their titles: but a list of these is given at the close of vol.
ii.]
PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION
The demand for this work so far exceeded my expectations that I was
"unable to make any considerable changes in the second edition, issued"
"in March, 1902; and circumstances again make it impossible for me to"
"give the work that thorough recension which I should desire. I have,"
"however, carefully considered the suggestions offered by critics, and"
have adopted them in some cases. Professor Fournier of Vienna has most
kindly furnished me with details which seem to relegate to the domain
of legend the famous ice catastrophe at Austerlitz; and I have added a
"note to this effect on p. 50 of vol. ii. On the other hand, I may"
justly claim that the publication of Count Balmain's reports relating
"to St. Helena has served to corroborate, in all important details, my"
account of Napoleon's captivity.
It only remains to add that I much regret the omission of Mr. Oman's
"name from II. 12-13 of page viii of the Preface, an omission rendered"
all the more conspicuous by the appearance of the first volume of his
"""History of the Peninsular War"" in the spring of this year."
asked.
"""Nay,"" said Sergeant Cardono; ""but when I am required to guide a party"
"secretly to San Ildefonso, where the court of the Queen-Regent is"
"sojourning, it does not require great penetration to see the general"
"nature of the service upon which I am engaged!"""
Rollo recovered himself.
"""You have not yet told me what you have discovered,"" he said,"
expectantly.
"""No,"" replied the Sergeant with great composure--""that can wait."""
For little Concha was approaching; and though he had limitless
expectations of the good influence of that young lady upon the military
"career of his officer, he did not judge it prudent to communicate"
"intelligence of moment in her presence. Wherein for once he was wrong,"
"since that pretty head of the Andalucian beauty, for all its clustering"
"curls, was full of the wisest and most far-seeing counsel--indeed, more"
to be trusted in a pinch than the _juntas_ of half-a-dozen provinces.
"But the Sergeant considered that when a girl was pretty and aware of it,"
she had fulfilled her destiny--save as it might be in the making of
military geniuses. Therefore he remained silent as the grave so long as
"Concha stayed. Observing this, the girl asked a simple question and then"
"moved off a little scornfully, only remarking to herself: ""As if I could"
"not make him tell me whenever I get him by himself!"""
"She referred (it is needless to state) not to Sergeant Cardono, but to"
"his commanding officer, Señor Don Rollo Blair of Blair Castle in the"
self-sufficient shire of Fife.
mantelpiece as if with purpose of personal assault. At such seasons the
stout old Abigail instantly remitted her attentions and stood perfectly
"well trained and motionless, with the brush and comb in her hand, till"
it pleased her lady to sit down again.
"All the while the gentleman said no word, but watched the development of"
"the scene with the utmost composure, passing his beautiful white fingers"
through his whiskers and moustache after the fashion of a comb. The
"lady's anger waxed higher and higher, and with it her voice also rose in"
an equal ratio. What the end would have been it is difficult to
"prophesy, for the Sergeant, realising that time was passing quickly,"
produced an instrument with a broad flat blade bent at an acute angle to
"the handle, and inserting it sharply into the crack of the French"
"window, opened it with a click which must have been distinctly audible"
"within, even in the height of the lady's argument."
CHAPTER XXXI
THE QUEEN'S ANTE-CHAMBER
Out of the darkness Rollo and the Sergeant stepped quickly into the
"room. Whereupon, small wonder that the lady should scream and fall back"
"into her chair, the waiting-maid drop upon the floor as if she had been"
"struck by a Carlist bullet, or the gentleman with the long and glossy"
whiskers suspend his caresses and gaze upon the pair with dropped jaw
and open mouth!
At his entrance Rollo had taken off his hat with a low bow. The Sergeant
"Edward Island, and losing his commission, he went to live near Halifax,"
"and became a lieutenant in the Nova Scotia Fencibles, while his wife"
"remained on the island to look after his estates, which brought him in"
"£300 a year. Meeting with a Scotchman called Morrison, together they"
"bought a ""pretty little New York battleship,"" mounting ten guns. Manning"
"this dangerous toy with a crew of ninety desperate characters, the"
"partners went ""on the account,"" and began well by taking a brig belonging"
"to Mr. Hill, of Rotherhithe, which they took to New York, and there sold"
both ship and cargo.
"They next cruised in the West Indies, taking several English and Dutch"
"ships, the crews of which they treated with the greatest brutality."
"Landing on St. Kitts Island, they burnt and plundered two Dutch"
"plantations, murdering the owners and slaves. Sailing north to"
"Newfoundland they took ten more vessels, which they sold in New York."
After further successful voyages in the West Indies and off the coast of
"Brazil, Nelson felt the call of home ties becoming so strong that he"
"ventured to return to Prince Edward Island to visit his wife and family,"
where no one dared to molest him.
"By this time Nelson had been a pirate for three years and had, by his"
"industry, won for himself a fortune worth £150,000, but his Scotch"
"partner, Morrison, being a frugal soul, had in the meantime saved an even"
larger sum. Eventually their ship was wrecked in a fog on a small barren
"island near Prince Edward Island, and Morrison and most of the crew were"
"drowned, but Nelson and a few others were saved. At last he reached New"
"York, where he lived the rest of his life in peaceful happiness with his"
wife and family.
"NICHOLLS, THOMAS, _alias_ NICHOLAS."
"the unstable progressive stage of popular well-being, though probably"
suffering less from it than either Germany or England.
"Here, then, is a group of kindred peoples apparently at least as capable"
"of reaching a solution of the social problem as any other, and visibly"
prospering materially and morally in proportion as they bring reason to
"bear on the vital lines of conduct, though still in the stage of curing"
over-population by emigration. Given continued peaceful political
"evolution in the direction first of democratic federation, and further"
"of socialisation of wealth, they may reach and keep the front rank in"
"civilisation, while the more unmanageably large communities face risks"
of dire vicissitude.
FOOTNOTES:
"[Footnote 638: As in Carlyle's _Early Kings of Norway_, the _caput"
mortuum_ of his historical method. Much more instructive works on
Scandinavian history are available to the English reader. The two
volumes on _Scandinavia_ by Crichton and Wheaton (1837) are not yet

"Middle Ages_ (4 vols.), and the _Germanic Empire_ (3 vols.), compiled"

"quality. But Geijer's _History of Sweden_, one of the standard modern"
"national histories of Europe, is translated into English as far as the"
period of Gustavus Vasa (3 vols. of orig. in one of trans. 1845); and
the competent _History of Denmark_ by C.-F. Allen is available in a
"French translation (Copenhagen, 2 tom. 1878). Otté's _Scandinavian"
"History_, 1874, is an unpretending and unliterary but well-informed"
"work, which may be used to check Crichton and Wheaton. The more recent"
"work of Mr. R. Nisbet Bain, _Scandinavia: a Political History of"
"grown to piracy, the northern League gave its main strength to trade by"
sea.
Its special interest for us to-day lies in the fact that it was
"ultra-racial, beginning in 1241 in a pact between the free cities of"
"Lübeck and Hamburg,[715] and finally including Wendish, German, Dutch,"
"French, and even Spanish cities, in fluctuating numbers. The motive to"
"union, as it had need be, was one of mercantile gain. Beginning,"
"apparently, by having each its separate authorised _hansa_ or"
"trading-group in foreign cities, the earlier trading-towns of the group,"
perhaps from the measure of co-operation and fraternity thus forced on
"them abroad,[716] saw their advantage in a special league for the common"
good as a monopoly maintained against outsiders; and this being
"extended, the whole League came to bear the generic name."
See Kohlrausch for the theory that contact in foreign cities is the
"probable cause of the policy of union (_History of Germany_, Eng."
"tr., p. 260; cp. Ashley, _Introd. to Economic History_, i, 104,"
"110). As to the origin of the word, see Stubbs, i, 447, _note_. The"
_hans_ or _hansa_ first appears historically in England as a name
"apparently identical with _gild_; and, starting with a _hansa_ or"
"hanse-house of their own, English cities in some cases are found"
"trading through subordinate _hansas_ in other cities, not only of"
Normandy but of England itself. Thus arose the Flemish Hansa or
"""Hansa of London,"" ignored in so many notices of the better-known"
Hanseatic League. Early in the thirteenth century it included a
number of the towns of Flanders engaged in the English wool-trade;
"and later it numbered at one time seventeen towns, including"
"Chalons, Rheims, St. Quentin, Cambray, and Amiens (Ashley, _Introd."

widely deposited over the continent of North America.
PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. The Cambrian system of North America comprises
"three distinct series, the LOWER CAMBRIAN, the MIDDLE CAMBRIAN,"
"and the UPPER CAMBRIAN, each of which is characterized by its own"
peculiar fauna. In sketching the outlines of the continent as it
"was at the beginning of the Paleozoic, it must be remembered that"
wherever the Lower Cambrian formations now are found was certainly
"then sea bottom, and wherever the Lower Cambrian are wanting, and"
"the next formations rest directly on pre-Cambrian rocks, was"
probably then land.
EARLY CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. In this way we know that at the opening
"of the Cambrian two long, narrow mediterranean seas stretched from"
north to south across the continent. The eastern sea extended from
the Gulf of St. Lawrence down the Champlain-Hudson valley and
thence along the western base of the Blue Ridge south at least to
Alabama. The western sea stretched from the Canadian Rockies over
the Great Basin and at least as far south as the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado in Arizona.
Between these mediterraneans lay a great central land which
included the pre-Cambrian U-shaped area of the Laurentian
"peneplain, and probably extended southward to the latitude of New"
Orleans. To the east lay a land which we may designate as
"APPALACHIA, whose western shore line was drawn along the site of"
"the present Blue Ridge, but whose other limits are quite unknown."
"The land of Appalachia must have been large, for it furnished a"
"great amount of waste during the entire Paleozoic era, and its"

present continental shelf. On the western side of the continent a
narrow land occupied the site of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
fail to appreciate the courtesy and consideration which he consistently
"showed her now. His patience with Captain Dove, a trying companion at"
"the best of times and doubly troublesome idle, more than once made her"
wonder whether he could be the same Jasper Slyne she had known on the
_Olive Branch_. Prosperity seemed to have improved him almost beyond
recognition.
He had a cabin at her disposal on the Calais-Dover steamer but she
"stayed on deck throughout the brief passage, glad to breathe the salt"
"sea-air again, while he entertained her with descriptions of London and"
she watched the twinkling lights that were guiding her home.
"And then came London itself, at last, somewhat grey, and cold, and"
disconsolate-looking on a wet winter morning.
"But after breakfast in a cosy suite at the Savoy, a blink of sunshine"
along the Embankment helped to better that first hasty impression. And
then Slyne took Captain Dove and her in a taxicab along the thronged and
bustling Strand to Mr. Jobling's office in Chancery Lane.
They got out in front of a dingy building not very far from Cursitor
"Street. It was raining again, and Sallie, looking up and down the"
"narrow, turbid thoroughfare, felt glad that she did not need to live"
there.
"Indoors, the atmosphere was scarcely less depressing. A dismal passage"
"led toward a dark stairway, up which they had to climb flight after"
"flight to reach at last a dusty, ill-smelling, gas-lighted room,"
"inhabited only by a shabby, shock-headed hobbledehoy of uncertain age"
"and unprepossessing appearance, perched on a preposterously high stool"

It will be realised from the scanty number of examples offered in
"this section that it is only a side issue, a mere suggestion of an"
"occasional alternative for the Story-hour, as likely to develop the"
imagination.
I think it is well to have a good number of stories illustrating the
importance of common sense and resourcefulness. For this reason I
consider that stories treating of the ultimate success of the youngest
"son are very admirable for the purpose, because the youngest child,"
"who begins by being considered inferior to the elder ones, triumphs in"
"the end, either from resourcefulness, or from common sense, or from"
"some high quality, such as kindness to animals, courage in overcoming"
"difficulties, etc.[27]"
Thus we have the story of Cinderella. The cynic might imagine that it
was the diminutive size of her foot that ensured her success: the child
"does not realise any advantage in this, but, though the matter need not"
"be pressed, the story leaves us with the impression that Cinderella had"
"been patient and industrious, forbearing with her sisters. We know that"
"she was strictly obedient to her godmother, and in order to be this"
she makes her dramatic exit from the ball which is the beginning of
her triumph. There are many who might say that these qualities do not
ten of them.
"At last they met with a French vessel, a Martinico ship, of twelve guns,"
"and hunger drove them to attack even so big a ship as this, but the sight"
of the Black flag so terrified the French crew that they surrendered
"without firing a shot. After this, they took several vessels, and matters"
began to look much brighter. Phillips quickly developed into a most
"accomplished and bloody pirate, butchering his prisoners on very little or"
on no provocation whatever. But even this desperate pirate had an
"occasional ""qualm of conscience come athwart his stomach,"" for when he"
"captured a Newfoundland vessel and was about to scuttle her, he found out"
"that she was the property of a Mr. Minors of that island, from whom they"
"stole the original vessel in which they went a-pirating, so Phillips,"
"telling his companions ""We have done him enough injury already,"" ordered"
"the vessel to be repaired and returned to the owner. On another occasion,"
"they took a ship, the master of which was a ""Saint"" of New England, by"
"name Dependance Ellery, who gave them a pretty chase before being"
"overhauled, and so, as a punishment, the ""Saint"" was compelled to dance"
the deck until he fell down exhausted.
"This pirate's career ended with a mutiny of his unruly crew, Phillips"
being tripped up and then thrown overboard to drown off Newfoundland in
"April, 1724."
"During the nine months of Phillips's command as a pirate captain, he"
accounted for more than thirty ships.

"which these occasioned"" (Robertson, _Charles V_, bk. v, ed. cited"
"of _Works_, vol. iv, p. 387). ""It was only tanners, dyers, and"
apostate priests who were Protestants at that day in the
"Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 124). The same conditions would have had"
"similar results in Spain, where many Catholics thought Philip much"
"too religious for his age and station (Motley, p. 76)."
It seems necessary to insist on the elementary fact that it was
Netherlanders who put Protestants to death in the Netherlands; and
that it was Spaniards who were burnt in Spain. In the Middle Ages
"""nowhere was the persecution of heretics more relentless than in"
"the Netherlands"" (Motley, p. 36; cp. p. 132). Grenvelle, most"
"zealous of heresy-hunters, was a Burgundian; Viglius, an even"
"bitterer persecutor, was a Frisian. The statement of Prescott"
"(_Philip II_, Kirk's ed. 1894, p. 149) that the Netherlanders"
"""claimed freedom of thought as their birthright"" is a gratuitous"
"absurdity. As regards, further, the old hallucination of ""race"
"types,"" it has to be noted that Charles, a devout Catholic and"
"persecutor, was emphatically _Teutonic_, according to the"
established canons. His stock was Burgundo-Austrian on the father's
side; his Spanish mother was of Teutonic descent; he had the fair
"hair, blue eyes, and hanging jaw and lip of the Teutonic Hapsburgs"
"(see Menzel, _Geschichte der Deutschen_, cap. 341), and so had his"
"descendants after him. On the other hand, William the Silent was"
"markedly ""Spanish"" in his physiognomy (Motley, p. 56), and his"
reticence would in all ages pass for a Spanish rather than a
"""Teutonic"" characteristic. Motley is reduced to such shifts of"
"rhetoric concerning Philip II as the proposition (p. 75) that ""the"
Burgundian and Austrian elements of his blood seemed to have
"evaporated."" But his descendant, Philip IV, as seen in the great"
"portraits of Velasquez, is, like him, a ""typical"" Teuton; and the"
"stock preserved the Teutonic physiological tendency to gluttony, a"
insisted on signing the pirate articles and boasted that he was the first
"surgeon that had ever done so, and he hoped, he said, to prove as great a"
rogue as any of them.
"When the African Company's Guinea ship, the _King Solomon_, was taken,"
Scudamore came aboard and helped himself to their surgeon's instruments
"and medicines. He also took a fancy for a backgammon board, but only kept"
it after a violent quarrel with another pirate. It came out at his trial
"that on a voyage from the Island of St. Thomas, in a prize, the _Fortune_,"
"in which was a cargo of slaves, Scudamore had tried to bring about a"
"mutiny of the blacks to kill the prize crew which was on board, and he was"
"detected in the night going about amongst the negroes, talking to them in"
the Angolan language. He said that he knew enough about navigation to sail
"the ship himself, and he was heard to say that ""this were better than to"
"be taken to Cape Corso to be hanged and sun dried."""
The same witness told how he had approached the prisoner when he was
"trying to persuade a wounded pirate, one James Harris, to join him in his"
"scheme, but fearing to be overheard, Scudamore turned the conversation to"
horse-racing.
"Scudamore was condemned to death, but allowed three days' grace before"
"being hanged, which he spent in incessant prayers and reading of the"
"Scriptures. On the gallows he sang, solo, the Thirty-first Psalm. Died at"
the age of 35.

"In 1664 he brought in two Spanish prizes to Port Royal, but as orders had"
only lately come from England to the Governor to do all in his power to
"promote friendly relations with the Spanish islands, these prizes were"
"Summer tourists were still there; the Casino was full of people, the"
shops were doing an active trade; the restaurants were crowded with
"English, Americans, Belgians taking tea, chocolate, or liqueurs at"
little tables and creating a babel of talk. Newspapers were being
sold everywhere by ragamuffin boys who shouted their head-lines in
"French, Flemish, and quite understandable English. A fort or two at"
"Liége had fallen, but it was of no consequence. General Léman could"
"hold out indefinitely, and the mere fact that German soldiers had"
entered the town of Liége counted for nothing. Belgium had virtually
won the war by holding up the immense German army. France was
"overrunning Alsace, Russia was invading East Prussia and also"
"sending uncountable thousands of soldiers, via Archangel, to"
"England, whence they were being despatched to Calais for the relief"
of Belgium.

Then she returned to the train which in her absence had been so
crowded with soldiers and civilian passengers that she had great
difficulty in finding her place and seating herself. The young man
whom she had seen pacing the deck of the steamer approached her and
"said: ""There is more room in my compartment; in fact I have"
"selfishly got one all to myself. Won't you share it?"""
She thanked him and moved in there with her suit case and rugs.
When the train had started and she had parried one or two polite
"enquiries as to place and ventilation, she said: ""I think I ought to"
"tell you who I am, in case you would not like to be seen speaking to"
"distinguished for a particular line of study, should be given the"
preference. I think the prospects of the Indian Educational Service are
sufficiently high to attract the very best material. In colonial
Universities they manage to get very distinguished men without any
extravagantly high pay. Possibly the present departmental method of
election does not admit of sufficiently wide publicity of notice to
attract the best candidates.

non-Europeans._--Passing on to the question of limitations that exist in
"the employment of Indians in the higher service, I should like to give"
expression to an injustice which is very keenly felt. It is unfortunate
that Indian graduates of European Universities who have distinguished
themselves in a remarkable manner do not for one reason or other find
facilities for entering the higher Educational Service.

But we were soon to learn that the Roman Catholics did not think of the
infant Christ as lacking in power of a certain sort; on the contrary
they ascribe miraculous agency even to an image of the divine babe. On
"the afternoon of December 29th, as two of our party were returning to"
"our hotel, they passed at the foot of the Capitoline Hill a carriage,"
"out of the window of which hung a ribbon or sash of cloth of gold, and"
"they were not a little astonished to observe that, as this carriage"
"rolled along, people knelt reverently before it on the street. Inside"
they saw two bareheaded men holding a child on a pillow with a wealth
of lace about it. They thought perhaps it was the royal carriage with
"the baby princess, but they could not imagine why _men_ should be"
"nursing the baby, as that is usually the employment of women, nor why"
"the people should kneel so reverently before the young princess, a"
"thing which they never did even for the king himself. The fact is that,"
as they learned on the following afternoon when visiting the Church of
"Ara Coeli, on the Capitoline Hill, the carriage in question belonged to"
"a far more important personage in Rome than any princess, though that"
"personage was not even a living baby, but only a doll. It was the coach"
of the famous Bambino--_Il Santissimo Bambino_--which with its dress
"of gold and silver tissue and its magnificent diamonds, emeralds and"
"rubies, is the chief attraction of this church."

DIE CUTTING
"Dies,[41] generally required for stamping the covers of books in gilt"
"letters and designs, are cut in brass by hand or by finely adjusted"
"routing-machines, the design being drawn upon the metal by an artist,"
or transferred to it by photography. In the case of very elaborate
"designs, the dies are first etched by nitric acid or iron perchloride,"
"and the more open or less intricate spaces then deepened by hand, or by"
the routing-machines.
THE PAPER
"In selecting the paper for the book, the publisher must consider the"
"surface required by his plates, the weight necessary to give a proper"
"bulk in proportion to the size of his volume, and the quality as"
"regulated by the price. The average book, with no text illustrations,"
"is printed on wove[42] paper of antique finish, which is a fairly rough"
"surface, giving a maximum bulk. A 12mo[42] book should bulk 1 to 1⅛"
"inches, a 10mo[42] book, 1⅛ to 1¼ inches. If the book runs more than an"
"average length, a medium-or a plate-finish paper may be used, and the"
weight per ream is regulated by the number of pages in each volume and
the bulk required.
"Lineplates print satisfactorily on medium-finish paper, and even"
on antique-finish if the lines are not too fine. Halftones require
"English-finish,[42] super-calendered[42] or coated[42] paper."
"Netherlands, drawing thither the unearned revenues of the Americas, and"
"still contrived to keep Spain subject to his rule, the latter country"
"would have been thrown back on her great natural resources, her"
"industry, and her commerce, which, as it was, developed markedly during"
"his reign,[765] despite the heavy burdens of his wars. And in that case"
Spain might conceivably have become the Protestant and rebellious
"territory, and the Netherlands on the contrary have remained Catholic"
"and grown commercially decrepit, having in reality the weaker potential"
economic basis.
"The theorem that the two races were vitally opposed in ""religious"
"sentiment,"" and that ""it was as certain that the Netherlanders"
would be fierce reformers as that the Spaniards would be
"uncompromising persecutors"" (Motley, p. 31), is part of the common"
"pre-scientific conception of national development, and proceeds"
upon flat disregard of the historical evidence. It is well
established that there was as much heresy of the more rational
"Protestant and Unitarian sort in Spain, to begin with, as in"
Holland. Under Ferdinand and Isabella the Inquisition seems to
"have struck mainly at Judaic and Moorish monotheistic heresy, which"
"was not uncommon among the upper classes, while the lower were for"
"the most part orthodox (Armstrong, _Introd._ to Major Hume's"
"_Spain_, pp. 14, 18). Thus there is good ground for the surmise"
that Ferdinand's object was primarily the confiscation of the
"wealth of Jews and other rich heretics. (See U.R. Burke, _History"
"of Spain_, 1895, ii, 101; Hume's ed. 1900, ii, 74.) In Aragon,"
"Valencia, and Catalonia there was general resistance to the"
Inquisition; in Cordova there was a riot against it; in Saragossa
"the Inquisitor was murdered before the altar (Armstrong, p. 18;"
"Llorente, _Hist. crit. de l'Inquisition d'Espagne_, éd. 1818, i,"
"185-213; M'Crie, _Reformation in Spain_, ed. 1856, pp. 52-53. Cp."

"Figure 207, a strong unconformity parts the schists and the"
Algonkian. The floor on which the Algonkian rests is remarkably
"even, and here again is proved an interval of incalculable length,"
during which an ancient land mass of Archean rocks was baseleveled
before it received the cover of the sediments of the later age.
THE LAKE SUPERIOR REGION. In eastern Canada an area of pre-
"Cambrian rocks, Archean and Algonkian, estimated at two million"
"square miles, stretches from the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence"
"River northward to the confines of the continent, inclosing Hudson"
"Bay in the arms of a gigantic U. This immense area, which we have"
"already studied as the Laurentian peneplain, extends southward"
"across the Canadian border into northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and"
Michigan. The rocks of this area are known to be pre-Cambrian; for
"the Cambrian strata, wherever found, lie unconformably upon them."
The general relations of the formations of that portion of the
area which lies about Lake Superior are shown in Figure 262. Great
"unconformities, UU' separate the Algonkian both from the Archean"
"and from the Cambrian, and divide it into three distinct systems,"
"--the LOWER HURONIAN, the UPPER HURONIAN, and the KEWEENAWAN. The"
Lower and the Upper Huronian consist in the main of old sea muds
"and sands and limy oozes now changed to gneisses, schists,"
"marbles, quartzites, slates, and other metamorphic rocks. The"
"Keweenawan is composed of immense piles of lava, such as those of"
"Iceland, overlain by bedded sandstones. What remains of these rock"
systems after the denudation of all later geologic ages is
"enormous. The Lower Huronian is more than a mile thick, the Upper"
"Huronian more than two miles thick, while the Keweenawan exceeds"
nine miles in thickness. The vast length of Algonkian time is
shown by the thickness of its marine deposits and by the cycles of
erosion which it includes. In Figure 262 the student may read an
await this hour; there might one find the treasures of the Forty
"Thieves. And so I quarried on slowly, with bated breath, savouring"
"the interest. Believe me, I had little palate left for the jelly; and"
"though I preferred the taste when I took cream with it, I used often to"
go without because the cream dimmed the transparent fractures.”
"In his work on Imagination, Ribot says: “The free initiative of"
children is always superior to the imitations we pretend to make for
them.”
The passage from Robert Stevenson becomes more clear from a scientific
point of view when taken in connection with one from Karl Groos' book
on the “Psychology of Animal Play”:
"“The Child is wholly absorbed in his play, and yet under the ebb and"
"flow of thought and feeling like still water under wind-swept waves, he"
has the knowledge that it is pretence after all. Behind the sham ‘I’
"that takes part in the game, stands the unchanged ‘I’ which regards the"
sham ‘I’ with quiet superiority.”
Queyrat speaks of play as one of the distinct phases of a child's
"imagination; it is “essentially a metamorphosis of reality, a"
transformation of places and things.”
"Now to return to the point which Mrs. Ewing makes, namely, that we"
should develop in normal children the power of distinguishing between
Truth and Falsehood.
I should suggest including two or three stories which would test that
"power in children, and if they fail to realise the difference between"
romancing and telling lies then it is evident that they need special
attention and help along this line. I give the titles of two stories of
"lock the Pope into his chamber, and take the key with her!"" She finally"
"""deserted him on his death-bed, making off with the accumulated spoils"
"of his ten years' papacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to build"
"the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, in the Corso, and the beautiful Villa Doria"
"Pamfili,"" west of the Janiculan Hill. This villa, with its casino,"
"garden, lake, fountain, pine-shaded lawns and woods, and its fine view"
"of St. Peter's standing out against the green Campagna beyond, and"
"the blue Sabine mountains in the distance, is to this day one of the"
"loveliest villas in Italy, and the favorite resort of the latter-day"
Romans and visitors to their city on the two afternoons of the week on
which it is open to pedestrians and two-horse carriages.
"The notorious Simony practiced by the popes, in which, as we have just"
"seen, Olympia became such an adept, gave rise to the biting Latin"
couplet--
"""An Petrus Romæ fuerit, sub judice lis est;"
"Simonem Romæ nemo fuisse negat."""
Some of the modern methods of making use of the Pope for purposes
of gain are less objectionable than those of Olympia. Dr. Alexander
"Robertson, in his _Roman Catholic Church in Italy_, just published,"
"says: ""One of the very latest novelties of the 'Pope's Shop' is a"
penny-in-the-slot blessing machine. Specimens of this were lately to be
"seen in the Corso, Rome, about half way between the Piazza Colonna and"
"the Piazza del Popolo. A penny is dropped into it. The cinematograph,"
"or wheel of life, goes round, when, lo! there appears a long procession"
"of richly clothed cardinals and monsignori, and then the Pope in a"
"sedan chair, accompanied by his Swiss Guards. As he is carried past"
"the spectator, he turns towards the window of his chair, a smile"
"overspreads his face, he raises his hands, and gives his blessing. On"
these machines there is an inscription to the effect that the blessing
"fell down dead upon the stage, and so was carried thence away by"
"his lords and gentlemen, and then the music ceased. Hereby was"
"signified, that as glass by nature holdeth no poison, but is clear"
"and may easily be seen through, ne boweth by any art; so a faithful"
"counsellor holdeth no treason, but is plain and open, ne yieldeth"
"to any indiscreet affection, but giveth wholesome counsel, which"
the ill advised prince refuseth. The delightful gold filled with
"poison betokeneth flattery, which under fair seeming of pleasant"
"words beareth deadly poison, which destroyeth the prince that"
"receiveth it. As befel in the two brethren, Ferrex and Porrex, who,"
"refusing the wholesome advice of grave counsellors, credited these"
"young parasites, and brought to themselves death and destruction"
thereby.
But it is time to set forth the plot in more detail. The importance of
_Gorboduc_ as an example of English 'classical' tragedy prompts us to
"follow it through, scene by scene."
"_Act I, Scene 1._--Queen Videna discovers to her favourite and elder"
"son, Ferrex, the king's intention, grievous in her eyes, of dividing his"
kingdom equally between his two sons. _Scene 2._--King Gorboduc submits
"his plan to the consideration of his three counsellors, whose wise and"
lengthy reasonings he listens to but elects to disregard.
"_Act II, Scene 1._--The division having been carried out, Ferrex, in his"
"part of the kingdom, is prompted by evil counsel to suspect aggressive"
"rivalry from his brother, and decides to collect forces for his own"
defence. _Scene 2._--Ferrex's misguided precautions having been
"maliciously represented to Porrex as directed against his power, that"
prince resolves upon an immediate invasion of his brother's realm.
_Act III._--The news of these counter-moves and of the imminent
"he was, notwithstanding, a rather notable figure as he stood looking"
gravely and thoughtfully downwards; there was something very graceful in
"his attitude, and in the carriage of his head, and his features were so"
remarkably handsome that Lady Romaine turned her eyes upon him many
"times, and exerted all her artifices to draw him back to her immediate"
"neighbourhood.  But he was perfectly unconscious of this, not hearing"
"the chatter which went on about him, lost in some reverie of his own,"
which brought a peculiar dreamy softness into his eyes.
"Lord Sandford, following the direction of Geraldine’s glance, looked at"
"this motionless figure, then back at the girl, and laughed."
"""Lady Geraldine, pray permit me to present to you my newly-made friend"
"and comrade, Sir Grey Dumaresq, who, I doubt not, is dying to make his"
"bow to so fair a lady."""
"She flashed him a glance half merry, half reproachful, and he suddenly"
"laid his hand upon his lips, a laugh rolling from them hearty and full."
"""I’ faith I had forgot!  How shall I teach my rebel tongue a new"
"language?  But Sir Grey will atone for all my defects.—Here is a lady,"
"if you will believe it, O friend, who loves not the sugared and honeyed"
"phrase of adulation, but seeks in all things truth, virtue, and I know"
not what else beside.  It is whispered to me that she is a mistress of
"all the _belles lettres_, and perchance a poetess herself."""
"""Nay, my lord,"" answered Geraldine, with a blush and a smile—""only one"
"who loves the poesy of those who have lived before, and left their"
"treasures for us who come after, and would fain drink in all the beauty"
"of their thoughts and of their lives."""
"Lord Sandford good-naturedly yielded his seat to Grey, whose sensitive"
Somehow I suspected her of a deliberate intention to mislead me in this
"matter.  She was a shrewd woman, who only disclosed her secrets when it"
was to her own interests or the interests of her friends at the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs to do so.  In Paris there is a vast network of French
"intrigue, and it behoves the diplomatist always to be wary lest he"
should fall into the pitfalls so cunningly prepared for him.  The
dividing line between truth and untruth is always so very difficult to
define in modern diplomacy.  It is when the European situation seems
most secure that the match is sufficiently near to fire the mine.
"Fortunate it is that the public, quick to accept anything that appears"
"in the daily journals, can be placed in a sense of false security by"
articles inspired by one or other of the embassies interested.  If it
"were not so, European panics would certainly be of frequent occurrence."
"My Chief sauntered by, chatting with his close personal friend, Prince"
"Olsoufieff, the Russian Ambassador, who looked a truly striking figure"
"in his white uniform, with the Cross of St. Andrew glittering at his"
"throat.  The latter, as he passed, exclaimed confidentially in Russian"
"to my Chief, who understood that language, having been first Secretary"
of Embassy in Petersburg earlier in his career:
"""Da, ya po-ni-mai-u.  Ya sam napishu.""  (""Yes, I understand.  I will"
"write for you myself."")"
"Keen antagonists in diplomacy though they very often were, yet in"
private life a firm friendship existed between the pair--a friendship
dating from the days when the one had been British Attache in Petersburg
and the other had occupied a position in the Russian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs--that large grey building facing the Winter Palace.
"""The lion and the bear strolling together,"" laughed the toothless old"
"Baronne, after they had passed.  ""Olsoufieff is a charming man, but he"
always prefer rules to principles of conduct. But in vain do we
clamour against intellectual complications which are the inevitable
"endowment of these days. Life is necessarily intricate, subtle and"
"anxious, and Democracy has made of each man a ruler and governor in"
his degree. Is it possible to point to a single principle which shall
"be a motive and a standard of duty, which shall establish a synthetic"
method after the ruthless analysis of the later Victorian days?
How searching that analysis has been! Fifty years ago the man in the
"street might rarely read the Bible, but he had a tolerably assured"
"conviction that the Bible was infallible, however resolutely he might"
refuse its interpretation by an infallible church.
Then
“...the Essays and Reviews debate Begins to tell on the
"public mind, and Colenso’s views have weight.”"
Plain people were taught to look on the Old Testament as a library of
"Hebrew literature containing not only poetry and history, but romance."
"When Colenso’s book first appeared, Matthew Arnold deprecated its"
publication since it brought criticisms familiar to men of culture
"before the notice of the public, without considering how the beliefs"
of “the vulgar” might be upset.
"The supercilious apostle of “sweetness and light,” himself contributed"
"largely in later years to the general confusion in men’s minds, and"
the New Testament criticism has been introduced to the general public
by Mr. Arnold’s accomplished niece.
"Our friend, the man in the street, was all unprepared!"
One loses track of time while sailing in south Florida waters. There is
a lassitude that laughs at clocks; the lotus floats over the waves even
"as over the land, and a poetic languor steals into the soul breeding an"
"indifference to hours and days--wretched things, at best, that were only"
"meant for slaves! Neither of us realized our passing into Barnes Sound,"
"and saw only that the _Whim_, sails gracefully drawing, cut the water as"
cleanly as a knife.
"Another day passed during which we shot at sharks, or trawled, or lay on"
deck smoking and occasionally gazing over the side at displays of fish
and flora twenty feet beneath us. But upon the third morning I asked:
"""Where are we bound, Gates?"""

[Sidenote: What the Italians now Think about it.]
"""But,"" some one may say, ""the pasquinades were written long ago, and,"
"while they are doubtless true descriptions of the papacy of the past,"
"surely no one would take the same view now."" For answer I may quote"
"the statement of Dr. Raffaelle Mariano, Professor of Philosophy in the"
"University of Naples, who is not a Protestant, but, as he tells us, was"
"""born in the Roman Catholic Church,"" and was ""a fervent Catholic from"
"infancy."" Speaking of the vast difference which he found between the"
teachings of the church and those of the New Testament as to what is
"necessary to salvation, he says, ""Therefore, Roman Catholicism is not"
"only not Christianity, but it is the very antithesis of Christianity,"""
a statement every whit as strong as Pasquino's. Some American
"Protestants, especially those who have personal friends in the Roman"
Catholic Church whom they honor and love--and there are many people in
"that church who are richly worthy of honor and love, and who do not"
approve of the evils we have been describing any more than we do--are
sometimes disposed to think that Protestant writers are too severe in
"their condemnation of the Romish Church as a system. A visit to Italy,"
"the centre of Romanism, would quickly disabuse these overcharitable"
Protestants of that impression. We have all read of such things as
"are described above in connection with the relics and legends, but"
"they seem far away and unreal, and almost impossible, until we come"
to the home of Romanism and find them all around us. Then it ceases
to surprise us that so large a proportion of the most intelligent men
bleeding spot.
_Empyema._--I may here add the little that I have to say on this
subject. During the whole campaign the single case of primary empyema
"that I saw was the one recorded below, which deserves special mention as"
illustrating the disadvantage of extracting bullets on the field. Under
the conditions which necessarily accompanied this operation the
"ensurance of asepsis was impossible, and the additional wound no doubt"
proved the source of infection.
"(152) _Entry_, at the posterior margin of the sterno-mastoid"
"muscle, 2 inches above the clavicle; the bullet came to the"
"surface beneath the skin over the fifth rib, in the nipple line"
"of the right side. There was never any hæmoptysis, but the"
patient suffered with some dyspnoea throughout. After a three
"days' stay in the Field hospital, where the subcutaneous bullet"
"was removed, the patient was transported by wagon and train to"
"the Base, a journey of about 600 miles."
"On the fifth day pus escaped from the extraction wound, and"
"when the case was examined at the Base, the temperature was"
"101°, the pulse over 100, the respirations 30, and the whole"
"side of the chest was dull, with the exception of a patch of"
boxy resonance over the apex anteriorly. On the following day
"the chest was drained, and a considerable amount of pus"
"evacuated, which was mixed with breaking-down blood-clot. A"
fortnight later a second operation had to be performed to
"improve the drainage, and the patient made a tedious recovery."
The following case well illustrates the symptoms in a severe case of
"hæmothorax, and empyema following aspiration:--"
"formations classified as the Cretaceous system, and which occur"
neither above these formations nor below them. On the basis of
these few fossils we may be confident that the strata in which
they were found in the antarctic region were laid in the same
period of geologic time as were the Cretaceous rocks of the United
States and Canada.
THE RECORD AS A TIME SCALE. By means of the law of included
organisms and the law of superposition the formations of different
countries and continents are correlated and arranged in their
natural order. When the geological record is thus obtained it may
be used as a universal time scale for geological history.
Geological time is separated into divisions corresponding to the
times during which the successive formations were laid. The
"largest assemblages of formations are known as groups, while the"
corresponding divisions of time are known as eras. Groups are
"subdivided into systems, and systems into series. Series are"
"divided into stages and substages,--subdivisions which do not"
concern us in this brief treatise. The corresponding divisions of
time are given in the following table.
STRATA     TIME
Group      Era
System     Period
Series     Epoch
The geologist is now prepared to read the physical history--the
geographical development--of any country or of any continent by
"means of its formations, when he has given each formation its true"
place in the geological record as a time scale.
"The following chart exhibits the main divisions of the record, the"
"home needs, and the industry is as yet largely prosecuted in an"
unsystematic and haphazard manner. It is claimed that sample shipments
"of coffee brought high prices in New York, but as yet not enough is"
"grown to permit exportation. Cacao, which thrives, is grown chiefly by"
"English and German planters, but as yet in a small way only. Cotton,"
tobacco and fiber plants also grow readily in this region but are little
cultivated.

"A curious industry of the Chiriqui country, now nearly abandoned, was"
the collection of gold ornaments which the Guaymi Indians formerly
"buried with their dead. These images sometimes in human form, more often"
"in that of a fish, sometimes like frogs and alligators, jointed and"
"flexible, were at one time found in great quantities and formed a"
conspicuous feature of the Panama curiosity shops. In seeking these the
hunters walked back and forth over the grounds known to be Indian burial
"places, tapping the ground with rods. When the earth gave forth a hollow"
"sound the spade was resorted to, and usually a grave was uncovered. Jars"
"which had contained wine and food were usually found in the graves,"
which were in fact subterranean tombs carefully built with flat stones.
The diggers tell of finding skulls perfectly preserved apparently but
which crumbled to pieces at a touch. Evidently the burial places which
"can be identified through local tradition have been nearly exhausted,"
for the ancient trinkets cannot longer be readily found in the Panama
shops.

"It was in March, 1710, that Rogers brought his little fleet into the"
"harbour of Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. Although at war with Spain,"
the captain soon became on his usual friendly terms with the Governor of
"this Spanish colony, and gave an entertainment on board his ship to him"
"and four other Spanish gentlemen, making them ""as welcome as time and"
"place would afford, with musick and our sailors dancing."" The Governor"
"gave a return party on shore, to which Rogers and all his brother officers"
"were invited, partaking of ""sixty dishes of various sorts."" After this"
"feast Rogers gave his host a present, consisting of ""two negro boys"
"dress'd in liveries."" One other instance of Woodes Rogers adaptability"
must suffice. In the year 1717 he was appointed Governor to the Bahama
"Islands, at New Providence, now called Nassau. His chief duty was to stamp"
out the West India pirates who had made this island their headquarters for
"many years, and were in complete power there, and numbered more than 2,000"
"desperadoes, including such famous men as Vane and Teach. Rogers's only"
"weapon, besides the man-of-war he arrived in, was a royal proclamation"
from King George offering free pardon to all pirates or buccaneers who
would surrender at once to the new Governor. At first the pirates were
"inclined to resist his landing, but in the end the tactful Rogers got his"
"own way, and not only landed, but was received by an armed guard of"
"honour, and passed between two lines of pirates who fired salutes with"
their muskets.
"Most of the pirates surrendered and received their pardons, but some, who"
reverted shortly afterwards to piracy and were captured and brought back
"to New Providence, were tried and actually hanged by Rogers's late"
buccaneer subjects.
Woodes Rogers eventually died in Nassau in the year 1729.
"4th February 1916. ""Many striking addresses were delivered on the"
occasion. Professor J.C. Bose in his masterly address went to the root
of the matter and pointed in an inspiring manner what should be done to
make the Hindu University worthy of its name. He deprecated a repetition
"of the Universities of the West."" He said:--"
In tracing the characteristic phenomenon of life from simple beginnings
"in that vast region which may be called unvoiced, as exemplified in the"
"world of plants, to its highest expression in the animal kingdom, one is"
repeatedly struck by the one dominant fact that in order to maintain an
organism at the height of its efficiency something more than a
mechanical perfection of its structure is necessary. Every living
"organism, in order to maintain its life and growth, must be in free"
communion with all the forces of the Universe about it.
STIMULUS WITHIN AND WITHOUT
"Further, it must not only constantly receive stimulus from without, but"
"must also give out something from within, and the healthy life of the"
organism will depend on these two fold activities of inflow and
"outflow. When there is any interference with these activities, then"
"morbid symptoms appear, which ultimately must end in disaster and death."
This is equally true of the intellectual life of a Nation. When through
narrow conceit a Nation regards itself self-sufficient and cuts itself
"from the stimulus of the outside world, then intellectual decay must"
inevitably follow.
SPECIAL FUNCTION OF A NATION
So far as regards the receptive function. Then there is another function
favour of the more difficult path. Dr. Bose chose the more difficult
"path, and entered into a phase of activity which was to test all his"
strength.
CASTE IN SCIENCE
Dr. Bose's discovery of Universal sensitiveness of matter was
"communicated to the Royal Society on May 7th, 1901, when he himself gave"
"a successful experimental demonstration. His communication was, however,"
"strongly assailed by Sir John Burden-Sanderson, the leading"
"physiologist, and one or two of his followers. They had nothing to urge"
against his experiments but objected to a physicist straying into the
preserve that had been specially reserved for the physiologist. He had
unwittingly strayed into the domain of a new and unfamiliar caste system
"and offended its etiquette. In consequence of this opposition his paper,"
"which was already in print, was not published. This is not by any means"
"to be regarded as an injustice done to a stranger. Even Lord Rayleigh,"
"who occupies an unique position in the world of science, was subjected"
"to fierce attacks from the chemists, because he, a physicist, had"
ventured to predict that the air would be found to contain new elements
not hitherto discovered.
"It is natural that there should be prejudice against all innovations,"
and the attitude of Sir John Burden-Sanderson is easily explained.
Unfortunately there was another incident about which similar explanation
could not be urged. Dr. Bose's Paper had been placed in the archives of
"the Royal Society, so that technically there was no publication. And it"
"came about that eight months after the reading of his Paper, another"
communication found publication in the Journal of a different society
which was practically the same as Dr. Bose's but without any
acknowledgment. The author of this communication was a gentleman who had
"beget children for the State and for Christ, says the lover, children"
"endowed by their upright parents with a good disposition, children who"
see the good example at home which is to guide them. Again and again he
reverts to the mother's duty to suckle the child herself. He indicates
"how the house should be arranged, in a simple and cleanly manner; he"
occupies himself with the problem of useful children's dress. Who stood
"up at that time, as he did, for the fallen girl, and for the prostitute"
compelled by necessity? Who saw so clearly the social danger of
"marriages of persons infected with the new scourge of Europe, so"
violently abhorred by Erasmus? He would wish that such a marriage should
at once be declared null and void by the Pope. Erasmus does not hold
"with the easy social theory, still quite current in the literature of"
"his time, which casts upon women all the blame of adultery and lewdness."
"With the savages who live in a state of nature, he says, the adultery of"
"men is punished, but that of women is forgiven."
"Here it appears, at the same time, that Erasmus knew, be it half in"
"jest, the conception of natural virtue and happiness of naked islanders"
in a savage state. It soon crops up again in Montaigne and the following
centuries develop it into a literary dogma.
CHAPTER XIII
ERASMUS'S MIND-CONTINUED
Erasmus's mind: Intellectual tendencies--The world encumbered by
beliefs and forms--Truth must be simple--Back to the pure
sources--Holy Scripture in the original languages--Biblical
humanism--Critical work on the texts of Scripture--Practice
certainly having no prevision she would not recross the Channel for
"four years and four months, and not see Dover again for five or six"
years.
British war vessels were off the port and inside it. But there was
not much excitement or crowding on the Ostende steamer or any of
"those sensational precautions against being torpedoed or mined,"
which soon afterwards oppressed the spirits of cross-Channel
passengers. Vessels arriving from Belgium were full of passengers of
"the superior refugee class, American and British tourists, or"
wealthy people who though they preferred living abroad had begun to
think that the Continent just now was not very healthy and England
the securest refuge for those who wished to be comfortable.
"Vivie being a good sailor and economical by nature, never thought of"
securing a cabin for the four or five hours' sea-journey. She sat on
the upper deck with her scanty luggage round her. A nice-looking
"young man who had a cabin the door of which he locked, was walking"
up and down on the level deck and scrutinizing her discreetly. And
when at last they worked their way backwards into Ostende--the
"harbour was full of vessels, chiefly mine-dredgers and torpedo"
boats--she noticed the obsequiousness of the steamer people and how
he left the ship before any one else.
"She followed soon afterwards, having little encumbrances in the way"
of luggage; but she observed that he just showed a glimpse of some
paper and was allowed to walk straight through the Douane with
"unexamined luggage, and so, on to the Brussels train."
But she herself had little difficulty. She put her hand luggage--she
"had no other--into a first-class compartment, and having an hour and"
a half to wait walked out to look at Ostende.
"and, according to instructions, looked the accountant officer"
"squarely in the face and gave his name and rating. Then, receiving"
"his money in the crown of his cap, the recipient saluted and moved"
away to make room for the next man.
All was proceeding smoothly and with the regularity of clockwork when
suddenly a diversion occurred.
The ship's company had a mascot in the shape of a young African
"monkey, that had been presented to the ""Sunderland"" by a French"
cruiser during a visit to an Algerian port. Although usually
"good-tempered ""Mephisto"" could and did exhibit fits of sulkiness and"
outbursts of insubordination that would have earned a lower deck man
"ninety days' ""confined to detention quarters."" But the monkey being a"
"sort of chartered libertine, was idolized by the ship's company and"
mildly tolerated by the officers.
Mephisto was lazily sunning himself under the lee of the quarter-deck
6-in gun shield when his eye caught sight of the chief writer's
"silver watch, which that petty officer had occasion to consult."
Probably the monkey imagined that it was one of the tins of condensed
milk for which he had great partiality.
"Getting on his four feet Mephisto ambled across the quarter-deck,"
past the line of men drawn up at attention. Before he could cross the
"chalk line, a symbol for which he had no respect, the chief writer"
had replaced his timepiece.
Foiled in that direction the monkey made a grab at a pile of brand
"new copper coins, and before any of the officers and men could"
"prevent, had made a rush for the weather-shrouds."
"The natives of Sinaketa, as we have seen in the last chapter, acquire"
"a certain amount of the Koya produce by means of trade. There are,"
"however, certain articles, useful yet unobtainable in the Trobriands,"
"and freely accessible in the Koya, and to these the Trobrianders"
"help themselves. The glassy forms of lava, known as obsidian, can be"
found in great quantities over the slopes of the hills in Sanaroa
"and Dobu. This article, in olden days, served the Trobrianders"
"as material for razors, scrapers, and sharp, delicate, cutting"
instruments. Pumice-stone abounding in this district is collected
"and carried to the Trobriands, where it is used for polishing. Red"
"ochre is also procured there by the visitors, and so are the hard,"
basaltic stones (binabina) used for hammering and pounding and for
"magical purposes. Finally, very fine silica sand, called maya, is"
"collected on some of the beaches, and imported into the Trobriands,"
"where it is used for polishing stone blades, of the kind which serve"
as tokens of value and which are manufactured up to the present day.
II
But by far the most important of the articles which the Trobrianders
"collect for themselves are the spondylus shells. These are freely,"
"though by no means easily, accessible in the coral outcrops of Sanaroa"
Lagoon. It is from this shell that the small circular perforated
"discs (kaloma) are made, out of which the necklaces of the Kula"
"are composed, and which also serve for ornamenting almost all the"
articles of value or of artistic finish which are used within the
"Kula district. But, only in two localities within the district are"
"these discs manufactured, in Sinaketa and in Vakuta, both villages in"
"Southern Boyowa. The shell can be found also in the Trobriand Lagoon,"
"If it is a double foetus with five feet, serious hostility in the"
"country, the house of the man will perish, his stall[45] will be"
destroyed.
"If it is a double foetus with six feet, the population will be"
"diminished, confusion in the land."
"If it is a foetus within a foetus, the king will weaken his enemy,"
his possessions will be brought into the palace[46].
*       *       *       *       *
"If a foetus gives birth to a second foetus[47], the king will assert"
himself against his opponent.
It will be observed that in quite a number of cases two alternative
"interpretations are given, one of an official character referring to the"
"public welfare, or to occurrences in the royal household[48], the other of"
an unofficial character bearing on the welfare of the individual to whom
the mother lamb that had produced the monstrosity belonged. One foetus
"issuing from the other, or one within the other, appears to have been a"
"favorable or an unfavorable sign, according to the position of the second."
"If the one lay above the other, the association of ideas pointed to a"
"control of the ruler over his enemy. In some cases, the association of"
ideas leading to the interpretation is not clear; and we must perhaps
assume in such instances an entry of an event that =actually= occurred
after the birth of the monstrosity in question. A certain measure of
arbitrariness in the interpretations also constitutes a factor to be taken
into consideration; and the last thing that we need to expect in any
system of divination is a =consistent= application of any principle
whatsoever.
[Illustration: A PERFECT BUNCH OF BANANAS]
The towns of Bocas del Toro and Almirante are maintained almost entirely
by the banana trade. Other companies than the United Fruit raise and buy
"bananas here, but it was the initiative of the leading company which by"
systematic work put the prosperity of this section on a firm basis.
Lands that a few years ago were miasmatic swamps are now improved and
"planted with bananas. Over 4,000,000 bunches were exported from this"
"plantation in 1911, and 35,000 acres are under cultivation there. A"
narrow gauge railway carries bananas exclusively. The great white
steamships sail almost daily carrying away little except bananas. The
money spent over the counters of the stores in Bocas del Toro comes from
natives who have no way of getting money except by raising bananas and
"selling them, mostly to the United Fruit Company. It has its"
"competitors, but it invented the business and has brought it to its"
"highest development. At this Panama town, and for that matter in the"
"other territories it controls, the company has established and enforces"
the sanitary reforms which Col. Gorgas applied so effectively in Colon
and Panama. Its officials proudly claim that they were the pioneers in
inventing and applying the methods which have conquered tropical
diseases. At Bocas del Toro the company maintains a hospital which lacks
"nothing of the equipment of the Ancon Hospital, though of course not so"
large. It has successfully adopted the commissary system established on
the Canal Zone. Labor has always been the troublesome factor in
industrial enterprises in Central America. The Fruit Company has joined
with the Isthmian Commission in the systematic endeavor to keep labor
contented and therefore efficient.
[Illustration: THE ASTOR YACHT AT CRISTOBAL]
Probably it will be the policy which any corporation attempting to do
with a view to checking internal hæmorrhage was used with good effect.
The wounds needed simple dressing only.
"The treatment of hæmothorax at a later date, however, was of much"
interest and difficulty. I think the following lines may be laid down
for guidance in such cases:--
"(i) Hæmothorax, even of considerable severity, will undergo spontaneous"
cure. An early rise of temperature may be disregarded.
(ii) Tapping the chest is indicated when pressure signs on the lung are
"sufficiently severe to cause serious symptoms, and the removal of the"
"blood undoubtedly shortens the period of recovery, as well as relieves"
symptoms.
In such cases the collection of blood has usually been rapid and
continuous; hence a fresh hæmorrhage is always probable when the local
pressure has been removed. Tapping therefore should not necessarily mean
"complete evacuation, and should be followed by careful firm binding up"
"of the chest, the administration of opium, and the most stringent"
precautions for rest.
"(iii) Tapping may be needed as a diagnostic aid, and in such"
circumstances as much fluid as can be removed should be evacuated with
the same precautions as mentioned in the last paragraph.
(iv) Tapping may be indicated for the evacuation of serum expressed from
"the blood-clot, or due to pleural effusion, on the same lines as in any"
other collection of fluid in the pleural cavity.
"(v) Early free incision is, as a rule, to be steadfastly avoided. Some"
cases already quoted fully illustrate its disadvantages.
"George crossed London Bridge, attired in his Quaker disguise, and made"
"his way to Deptford, where he preached in the streets. From Deptford"
"he followed the river by easy stages to Sheerness, where he lodged nearly"
"a week, awaiting a boat that would answer his purpose. Had he attempted"
"to board a vessel, he would have been seized and examined; therefore his"
"plan was to grow violent in his preaching, and, if possible, provoke the"
authorities to place him on board one of the outgoing crafts; that being
a favorite method of the king's men in getting rid of the too blatant
fanatics in Sheerness.
"The Dutch sea captains were fanatics almost to a man, and the exiled"
exhorters found them always willing to help their persecuted brethren of
the faith.
And so it happened with George in Sheerness. He was on the dock exhorting
"vehemently against the evils of the time, laying great stress on the"
wickedness of the king and denouncing the vileness of the court. Two of
"the king's officers tried to silence him, but failing, ordered him to"
leave England by a certain Dutch boat then waiting in the harbor with its
"pennant up. He protested and struggled, but at last was forced aboard,"
"raving against those godless Balaamites, the clergy of the Established"
"Church, who, with the devil, he declared, were behind his persecution."
So well did George play his part that a collection was taken up among the
passengers of the Dutch boat to help the good man so vilely put upon.
"There was a sweet bit of irony in the fact, learned afterwards, that the"
officers who forced George aboard the Dutch ship were at Sheerness for
the purpose of winning the two hundred pounds reward offered for his
capture.
The goodness of God occasionally takes a whimsical form.
Franciscan monks were awakened by the most furious ringing of bells
"and by thundering knocks at the west door of the church, and hastening"
"thither, could see nothing but a wee naked pink foot peeping in from"
"under the door; but when they opened the door, without stood the little"
"naked figure of the true Bambino of Ara Coeli, shivering in the wind"
"and rain--so the false baby was sent back in disgrace, and the real"
"baby restored to its home, never to be trusted away alone any more."""
[Sidenote: The Communion Table Used by Christ.]
But if I dwell on all these interesting relics and images as I have
"done on the Holy Cradle and the miraculous Bambino, I shall never"
finish even the brief list of them which I had in mind when I began. I
"must hasten on, contenting myself with a bare mention of a few of the"
more notable relics at the other churches.
On the 8th of January we paid our first visit to the great Church of
"St. John Lateran,[9] and here also the relics interested us more than"
anything else. Under the canopy in the centre the skulls of St. Peter
and St. Paul are preserved. Beneath the altar we saw the wooden table
"on which the Apostle Peter is said to have ""celebrated mass"" in the"
"house of Pudens. The interest of this relic, however, is completely"
eclipsed by that of another relic over an altar at a little distance
"in the same church, viz: the cedar table used by our Lord and his"
disciples in the Last Supper. This table is concealed behind a bronze
relief representing that solemn scene in the Upper Room at Jerusalem.
[Sidenote: Other Relics at St. John Lateran.]
"""The Basilica claims to possess many valuable relics. Amongst these are"
"some portions of the manger in which Christ was cradled, the shirt and"
seamless coat made for him by the Virgin; some of the barley loaves
"That, however, despite the largely fanciful character of the entries in"
"the omen texts, these collections not only rested on a firm basis of"
"actual observation, but served a practical purpose is shown by the"
examples that we have of official reports made by the =bârû=-priests of
"human and animal anomalies, with the interpretations attached that"
represent quotations from the collections[21]. A report of this kind in
reference to an animal monstrosity reads in part as follows[22]:
"'If it is a double foetus, but with one head, a double spine, two"
"tails and one body, the land that is now ruled by two will be ruled"
by one person.
"If it is a double foetus with one head, the land will be safe.'"
We have here two quotations from a text furnishing all kinds of
peculiarities connected with a double foetus and we are fortunate in
having the text from which the quotations are made[23]. Evidently an ewe
"has given birth to a monstrosity such as is here described, the case has"
"been reported to the diviners who furnish the king[24] with this report,"
"indicating that since the monstrosity has only one head, what might have"
been an unfavorable omen is converted into a favorable one.
Another report[25] regarding a monstrosity born of a sow reads:
"'If a foetus has eight feet and two tails, the ruler will acquire"
"universal sway. A butcher, Uddanu by name, reported as follows: A sow"
gave birth (to a young) having eight feet and two tails. I have
preserved it in salt and kept it in the house. From
Nergal-eṭir[26].'
Here we have the name of the =bârû=-priest who made the report expressly
“This would be lessening the joy of the world and taking from
"generations yet unborn the capacity for wonder, the power to take a"
"large unselfish interest in the spectacle of things, and putting them"
forever at the mercy of small private cares.
"A Nursery Rhyme is the most sane, the most unselfish thing in the"
"world. It calls up some delightful image,--a little nut-tree with a"
silver walnut and a golden pear; some romantic adventure only for the
child's delight and liberation from the bondage of unseeing dulness: it
brings before the mind the quintessence of some good thing:
'The little dog laughed to see such sport'--there is the soul of
"good humour, of sanity, of health in the laughter of that innocently"
wicked little dog. It is the laughter of pure frolic without
unkindness. To have laughed with the little dog as a child is the best
preservative against mirthless laughter in later years--the horse
"laughter of brutality, the ugly laughter of spite, the acrid laughter"
"of fanaticism. The world of Nursery Rhymes, the old world of Mrs."
"Slipper-Slopper, is the world of natural things, of quick, healthy"
"motion, of the joy of living."
In Nursery Rhymes the child is entertained with all the pageant of
"the world. It walks in Fairy Gardens, and for it the singing birds"
pass. All the King's horses and all the King's men pass before it in
"their glorious array. Craftsmen of all sorts, bakers, confectioners,"
"silversmiths, blacksmiths are busy for it with all their arts and"
"mysteries, as at the court of an Eastern King.”"
"In insisting on the value of this escape from the commonplace, I cannot"
prove the importance of it more clearly than by showing what may happen
to a child who is deprived of his birthright by having none of the
"Although these words were written nearly half a century ago, they are"
so specially applicable to-day that they seem quite “up-to-date”:
"indeed, I think they will hold equally good fifty years hence."
In spite of a strong taste on the part of children for what is ugly
"and brutal, I am sure that we ought to eliminate this element as far"
as possible from the school stories--especially among poor children.
Not because I think children should be protected from all knowledge
"of evil, but because so much of this knowledge comes into their life"
outside school that we can well afford to ignore it during school
"hours. At the same time, however, as I shall show by example when I"
"come to the positive side, it would be well to show children by story"
illustration the difference between brute ugliness without anything
"to redeem it and surface ugliness, which may be only a veil over the"
"beauty that lies underneath. It might be possible, for instance, to"
show children the difference between the real ugliness of a brutal
"story of crime and an illustration of it in the sensational papers,"
"and the apparent ugliness in the priest's face of the “Laocoon” group,"
because of the motive of courage and endurance behind the suffering.
Many stories in everyday life could be found to illustrate this.
VIII.--_Stories of infant piety and death-bed scenes._ The stories
"for children forty years ago contained much of this element, and the"
following examples will illustrate this point:
"Notes from poems written by a child between six and eight years of age,"
"by name Philip Freeman, afterwards Archdeacon of Exeter:"
"Poor Robin, thou canst fly no more,"
Thy joys and sorrows all are o'er.
"Through Life's tempestuous storms thou'st trod,"
in _Shadowings_) also gives a vivid account of his own childish
night-terrors.]
"[Footnote 89: It has not, I believe, been pointed out that such dreams"
might be invoked in support of the James-Lange or physiological theory of
"emotion, according to which the element of bodily change in emotion is the"
cause and not the result of the emotion.]
[Footnote 90: This physiological symbolism was clearly apprehended long
ago by Hobbes: 'As anger causeth heat in some parts of the body when we
are awake; so when we sleep the overheating of the same parts causeth
"anger, and raiseth up in the brain the imagination of an enemy. In the"
"same manner as natural kindness, when we are awake, causeth desire and"
"desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so also, too much"
"heat in those parts, while we sleep, raiseth in the brain an imagination"
"of some kindness shown. In sum, our dreams are the reverse of our waking"
"imaginations; the motion, when we are awake, beginning at one end, and"
"when we dream at another' (_Leviathan_, Part 1. ch. 2).]"
"[Footnote 91: 'The pains of disappointment, of anxiety, of unsuccess, of"
"all displeasing emotions,' remarks Mercier (art. 'Consciousness,' Tuke's"
"_Dictionary of Psychological Medicine_), 'are attended by a definite"
feeling of misery which is referred in every case to the epigastrium.' He
"adds that the pleasures of success and good repute, aesthetic enjoyment,"
"etc., are also attended by a definite feeling in the same region. This"
fact indicates the extreme vagueness of organic sensation. There is in
"fact much uncertainty and great difference of opinion as to the nature,"
"and even the existence, of organic sensation; see _e.g._ a careful summary"
"of the chief views by Dr. Elsie Murray, 'Organic Sensation,' _American"
"Journal of Psychology_, July 1909.]"

Panama officials are quite as determined to keep the wheels of their
criminal law moving. The proprietors of machines like to see them
run--which is one of the reasons why too many battleships are not good
for a nation.

"To return, however, to the statistics of the Zone. Its population is"
"shifting, of course, and varies somewhat in its size according to the"
extent to which labor is in demand. The completion of a part of the work
"occasionally reduces the force. In January, 1912, the total population"
"of the Zone, according to the official census, was 62,810; at the same"
"time, by the same authority, there were employed by the Canal Commission"
"and the Panama Railroad 36,600 men. These figures emphasize the fact"
"that the working force on the Zone is made up mainly of unmarried men,"
"for a working population of 36,600 would, under the conditions existing"
"in the ordinary American community, give a population of well over"
"100,000. Though statistics are not on hand, and would probably be"
"impossible to compile among the foreign laborers, it is probable that"
not more than one man in four on the Zone is married. From this
situation it results that the average maiden who visits the Zone for a
brief holiday goes rushing home to get her trousseau ready before some
young engineer’s next annual vacation shall give him time to go like a
"young Lochinvar in search of his bride. Indeed, the life of the Zone for"
"many reasons has been singularly conducive to matrimony, and as a game"
"preserve for the exciting sport of husband-hunting, it has been"
unexcelled.

seems to have the power of dissolving the cornea; a solution containing
ten grains of alum to the ounce of water may be used in canker of the

Such farewell speeches often served as a preface to the continuation of
"their acquaintance, which again began with drinking and went so far"
that the client would spend his last farthing.  Then the Captain would
"stand him treat, and they would drink all they had."
A repetition of similar doings did not affect in the least the good
relations of the parties.
The teacher mentioned by the Captain was another of those customers who
were thus reformed only in order that they should sin again.  Thanks to
"his intellect, he was the nearest in rank to the Captain, and this was"
"probably the cause of his falling so low as dosshouse life, and of his"
inability to rise again.  It was only with him that Aristid Kuvalda
could philosophise with the certainty of being understood.  He valued
"this, and when the reformed teacher prepared to leave the dosshouse in"
"order to get a corner in town for himself, then Aristid Kuvalda"
"accompanied him so sorrowfully and sadly that it ended, as a rule, in"
their both getting drunk and spending all their money.  Probably
Kuvalda arranged the matter intentionally so that the teacher could not
"leave the dosshouse, though he desired to do so with all his heart."
"Was it possible for Aristid Kuvalda, a nobleman (as was evident from"
"his speeches), one who was accustomed to think, though the turn of fate"
"may have changed his position, was it possible for him not to desire to"
have close to him a man like himself?  We can pity our own faults in
others.
"Carlist partisanship and military rank. Moreover, he had acquired, in"
"some unexplained way, a leathern Montera cap, a short many-buttoned"
"jacket, a flapped waistcoat of red plush, and leathern small-clothes of"
the same sort as those worn by La Giralda. Yet withal there remained
"something very remarkable about him. His great height, his angular"
"build, the grim humour of his mouth, the beady blackness of eyes which"
"twinkled with a fleck of fire in each, as a star might be reflected in a"
deep well on a moonless night--these all gave him a certain distinction
in a country of brick-dusty men of solemn exterior and rare speech.
"Also there was something indescribably daring about the man, his air and"
carriage. There was the swagger as of a famous _matador_ about the way
he carried himself. He gave a cock to his plain countryman's cap which
betokened one of a race at once quicker and more gay--more passionate
and more dangerous than the grave and dignified inhabitants of Old
Castile through whose country they were presently journeying.
"As Cardono and La Giralda departed out of the camp, the Sergeant driving"
before him a donkey which he had picked up the night before wandering by
"the wayside, El Sarria looked after them with a sardonic smile which"
"slowly melted from his face, leaving only the giant's usual placid good"
nature apparent on the surface. The mere knowledge that Dolóres was
alive and true to him seemed to have changed the hunted and desperate
outlaw almost beyond recognition.
"""Why do you smile, El Sarria?"" said Concha, who stood near by, as the"
"outlaw slowly rolled and lighted a _cigarrillo_. ""You do not love this"
"Sergeant. You do not think he is a man to be trusted?"""
"El Sarria shrugged his shoulders, and slowly exhaled the first long"
breathing of smoke through his nostrils.
atheistic rhetoric has been placarded at the cost of the State in
every commune throughout France.
"We may consider, then, if there be any method by which the man who"
"does not read theological or scientific or philosophical books, the"
"man who has left off going to church, or gets no help from the"
"average sermon, the man who has no reverence for mere authority, may"
be induced to consider the Christian Revelation as offering him a key
to those riddles of life which his civic responsibilities are
perpetually propounding.
Remember that his present condition may be roughly described as
consisting of religious haziness and moral laziness. The moral
laziness is being subjected to a series of rough shocks. He _must_
make up his mind about some questions of morality. The relation of the
"sexes, the duties of property, the treatment of the subject savage,"
"the survival of the unfit, the ethics of commerce, the control of the"
"sale of alcohol, the education of children, these things he has to"
"decide and he will ultimately decide. But he is at present perplexed,"
and his religious haziness is the reason of his perplexity. He perhaps
"has not reached the conclusion of his contemporary in France, but he"
is on the way to it. Those heavenly lights which M. Viviani declares
that his Government has extinguished still shine faintly for men in
"England, though the mists obscure them."
"Can we get men to look upwards for light, and instead of cursing the"
"ancient creed in a confused commination, to take Arthur Clough’s"
advice--
“Ah! yet consider it again.”
"I believe that there is a method, and as I mention it I am prepared"
"""Come with us,"" they cried; ""we are here for the greatest plunder ever"
"taken or dreamed of among the Romany----"""
"""Hush, I command you,"" cried the elder man. ""José Maria of Ronda this"
"man may be, but we are _Gitanos_ of the North, and need not a man from"
"Andalucia to lead us, even if he carry a scarlet cravat about his neck"
"for a credential!"""
The Sergeant nodded approval of this sentiment and addressed the old
"gipsy in deep Romany, to which he listened with respect, and answered in"
"a milder tone, shaking his head meanwhile."
"""I have indeed heard such sayings from my mother,"" he said, ""and I"
gather your meaning; but we _Gitanos_ of the North have mingled too much
with the outlander and the foreigner to have preserved the ancient
purity of speech. But in craft and deed I wot well we are to the full as
"good Roms as ever."""
By this time it was clear to the Sergeant that the old man was jealous
of his leadership; and as he himself was by no means desirous of taking
"part in a midnight raid against a plague-stricken town, he proceeded to"
"make it clear that, being on his way to his own country of Andalucia and"
had been led aside by the gipsy cryptograms he had observed by the
wayside and the casual greeting of the crook-backed imp of the village.
"Upon this the old man sat down beside Sergeant Cardono, or, as his new"
"friends knew him to be, José Maria the brigand. He did not talk about"
the intended attack as the Sergeant hoped he would. Being impressed by
"the greatness of his guest, he entered into a minute catalogue of the"
"captures he had made, the men he had slain as recorded on the butt of"
"his gun or the haft of his knife, and the cargoes he had successfully"
"severe. Master Bailey's assistance is next requisitioned, and him friend"
"Diccon cannot overreach. The whole truth coming out, Diccon is required"
to kneel and apologize. In doing so he gives Hodge a slap which elicits
"from that worthy a yell of pain. But it is a wholesome pang, for it"
finds the needle no further away than in the seat of Hodge's breeches.
If we compare this play with _Ralph Roister Doister_ three ideas will
"occur: first, that we have made no advance; second, that, in giving the"
"preference to rough country folk, the author has deliberately abandoned"
the higher standard of refinement in language and action set in Udall's
"major scenes; third, that whereas the earlier work bases its comedy on"
"character, educing the amusing scenes from the clash of vanity,"
"constancy and mischief, the later play relies for its comic effects on"
situations brought about by mischief alone. These are three rather heavy
counts against the younger rival. But in the other scale may be placed a
very fair claim to greater naturalness. Taking the scenes and characters
"in turn, mischief-maker, churchman and all, there is none so open to the"
"charge of being impossible, and therefore farcical, as the battle"
"between the forces of Ralph and Dame Custance, or the incredibly"
self-deceived Ralph himself. In accompanying Ralph through his
adventures we seem to be moving through a fantastic world in which Sir
"Andrew Aguecheek and Malvolio might feel at home; but with Dame Chat,"
Gammer Gurton and Hodge we feel the solid earth beneath our feet and
around us the strong air which nourished the peasantry and yeomen of
Tudor England.
The first extract is a verse from this comedy's one and famous song; the
"second is taken from Act I, Scene 4."

"Indeed, it is our misfortune in England that Bishops are almost"
necessarily bad leaders. We are told when an election to the Papacy is
imminent that this or that Cardinal is in the list of “Papabili”--a
possible Pope--so in like manner we may almost select amongst the
undergraduates of Oxford and Cambridge our future diocesans. These are
"men clever, shrewd, and hard-working, of estimable private character,"
and not without some modest patrimony. Early entered in the race for
"preferment, ambitious, and yet, _mirabile dictu_, devout, they are"
"endowed first of all with the true qualification for episcopacy, a"
capacity for compromise and a pliant political mind. _Sic itur ad
"astra_ the excellent curate or tutor, the courteous and accomplished"
"chaplain to the Bishop, the eloquent canon and ecclesiastical courtier"
is consecrated and enthroned. Henceforward for the rest of his days he
"must hurry from his study table, crowded with correspondence, to his"
"confirmations, his diocesan society meetings, and his weary,"
humiliating attendance at the House of Lords. What wonder if Bishops
"discourage new ventures of faith, who have no time for thinking, no"
"time for reading, and perhaps, sometimes, too little opportunity for"
prayer!
And so we find them not unwilling to accommodate the Catholic Faith to
"the popular prejudice of the moment, acquiescing in an undogmatic,"
"undenominational, more or less Christian creed. Popularity becomes the"
"very breath of their nostrils, and they proceed to hide in an"
"appendix to the Prayer-book, the hymn _Quicunque vult_."
Yet the discerning can see that now is no time for keeping in the
background the great truths of religion. Already men are being
prepared in many ways to receive them.
"gütes leute"" and that all would go smoothly in time."
Nevertheless the next morning when she could take stock she found
nearly all the poultry except the pigeons had disappeared; and most
"of the apples, ripe and unripe, had vanished from the orchard trees."
"The female servants of the farm, however, came back; and finding no"
"violence was offered took up their work again. Two days afterwards,"
"von Giesselin sent Vivie into Brussels in his motor, with his"
"orderly to escort her, so that she might deposit her valuables at a"
"bank. She found Brussels, suburbs and city alike, swarming with"
"grey-uniformed soldiers, most of whom looked tired and despondent."
"Those who were on the march, thinking Vivie must be the wife of some"
"German officer of high rank, struck up a dismal chant from dry"
"throats with a refrain of ""Gloria, Viktoria, Hoch! Deutschland,"
"Hoch!"" At the bank the Belgian officials received her with"
deference. Apart from being the daughter of the well-to-do Mrs.
"Warren, she was English, and seemed to impose respect even on the"
"Germans. They took over her valuables, made out a receipt, and"
cashed a fairly large cheque in ready money. Vivie then ventured to
ask the bank clerk who had seen to her business if he had any news.
"Looking cautiously round, he said the rumours going through the town"
"were that the Queen of Holland, enraged that her Prince Consort"
"should have facilitated the crossing of Limburg by German armies,"
"had shot him dead with a revolver; that the Crown Prince of Germany,"
"despairing of a successful end of the War, had committed suicide at"
his father's feet; that the American Consul General in Brussels--to
"whom, by the bye, Vivie ought to report herself and her mother, in"
order to come under his protection--had notified General Sixt von
"Arnim, commanding the army in Brussels, that, _unless he vacated the"
"Belgian capital immediately_, England would bombard Hamburg and the"
United States would declare war on the Kaiser. Alluring stories like
these flitted through despairing Brussels during the first two
"au moyen âge_, Bruxelles, 1874, p. 146 _sq._). There is some"
obscurity as to when the foreign Hansards were first permitted to
have warehouses and residences of their own in London. Cp.
"Cunningham, _Growth of English Industry and Commerce_, vol. i, §"
"68; and Ashley, i, 105, following Schanz, who dates this privilege"
"in the reign of Henry III, though the merchants of Cologne (_id._"
p. 110) had a _hansa_ or gildhall in London in the reign of Richard
"I. Under whatever conditions, it is clear that London was one of"
the first foreign cities in which the German Hansard traders came
in friendly contact.
A reciprocal and normal egoism furthered as well as thwarted the Hansard
enterprise. Trade in the feudal period being a ground of privilege like
"any other, the monopolied merchants of every city strove to force"
"foreign traders to deal with them only. On the other hand, the English"
nobility sought to deal rather with the foreigner directly than with the
"English middlemen; and thus in each feudal country, but notably in"
"England,[717] the interest of the landed class tended to throw foreign"
"trade substantially in foreign hands, which did their best to hold it."
In the reigns of the Edwards privileges of free trade with natives were
gradually conferred on the foreign traders[718] in the interests of the
"landed class--the only ""general consumers"" who could then make their"
claims felt--in despite of the angry resistance of the native merchant
"class. For the rest, in a period when some maritime English cities, like"
"those of France and Germany, could still carry on private wars with each"
"other as well as with foreign cities,[719] a trader of one English town"
"was in any other English town on all fours with a foreigner.[720] When,"
"therefore, the foreigners combined, their advantage over the native"
trade was twofold.
Naturally the cities least liable to regal interference carried on a
"cosmopolitan co-operation to the best advantage. The Hansa of London,"
"""I promise you, Colonel, the maid will be worth her billet,"" said the"
"Sergeant, ""or else she is no true Andaluse. To such an one in old days I"
"have often trusted----"""
Thus far Cardono had proceeded when suddenly he broke off his
"reminiscence, and with a paternal gesture patted Concha's arm as she was"
bending over to transfer a second helping of the _puchero_ to his dish.
"The party was now in excellent marching order, well-provisioned,"
"well-fed, rested, and provided with the best and most recent"
information. Even John Mortimer's slow English blood developed some
"latent Puritanic fire, and he said, ""Hang me if I do not fight for the"
"little girl who was willing to pay for the _whole_ of the goat-milk!"""
"To fight for a Queen, who at the early age of five was prepared to give"
"a wholesale order like that, appeared to John Mortimer a worthy and"
laudable deed of arms. He was free indeed to assist in taking her
"captive, if by so doing he could further the shipping of the Priorato he"
himself had paid for. But to make over to a set of thieves and murderers
a girl who had about her the makings of a good customer and a woman of
"business habits, stirred every chivalric feeling within him."
The night was so dark that it was resolved that the party should leave
their horses behind them in the stables of the deserted farm. They could
then proceed on foot more softly and with more safety to themselves. To
"this La Giralda, knowing that they must return that way, readily"
assented. For the thought of the dead woman she had left in the
"first-floor room haunted her, and even in the darkness of the night she"
could see the stark outlines of the sheet she had spread over the body.
"So it came to pass that once more horseshoe iron clattered, and there"
was a flashing of lights and a noise of voices about the lonely and
Competent proofreaders in the best offices frequently call the
"attention of the author to errors in dates, figures, or proper names,"
but this should always be regarded by the author as a courtesy
rather than as something which the printer is expected to do. The
"proofreader, on the other hand, is supposed to have corrected every"
"typographical error, and for the author to mark corrections which have"
been overlooked is a courtesy on the part of the author. The fact that
the author or editor has passed over typographical errors in no way
relieves the proofreader of his responsibility.
The proofreader is expected to correct any obvious error without
"hesitation, but to make no other changes. If he thinks a change should"
"be made, it will take the form of a query in the margin to the author."
"The author should carefully note all such queries, and answer them"
"or strike them out, bearing in mind that if he accepts the query the"
"change necessitated in the type becomes an author's correction, the"
expense of which falls upon the publisher.
Any marks on the proofs for correction should be made distinct by
"drawing a short line through the letter to be changed, etc., placing in"
"the margin the recognized sign indicating the change, _exactly opposite"
"the line in which the change is to be made, and in the order in which"
the necessary alterations occur_. In doing this be sure to write
"legibly, and do not cover the proof with lines and counter-lines."
The author should familiarize himself with the standard proofreading
"marks, and employ these in marking all corrections upon the proofs"
which are sent him. These marks are as follows:

irresponsible indolent reviewers.”
I believe that Fiction will find those that can be reached by no other
means. Fiction sometimes sets a man seeking for Fact.
Very diffidently and very reverently I may remind my contemporaries
"that one, who has, at any rate, profoundly influenced the course of"
"history, whatever view we may take of His person, did not disdain this"
"method, “He taught them by parables.”"
“Let me tell you a story.” Is there any age of mankind which does not
respond to the invitation and give audience? A story stilled the
"tumult of the nursery in our earliest days, when heavy storms shook"
"the windows and the tedium of a long, wet afternoon had turned play"
into fretfulness. A story beguiled us into interest when our History
"lesson had seemed an arid futility in Fourth Form days, and our"
magisterial enemies began to show themselves human after all when they
bade us read _The Last of the Barons_ as we were painfully plodding in
"the Plantagenet period, and found the War of the Roses a very thorny"
waste.
It is strange to turn over the pages of eminent evangelical sermons
of the early Victorian days and to notice how “Novel reading” is
denounced. Probably the worthy divines who fulminated against fiction
"were thinking of their own boyhood, and the mischief which came to"
them from Fielding and Richardson and Smollett surreptitiously
perused. Sir Anthony Absolute’s detestation of the circulating library
survived in some provincial circles even when Sir Walter Scott had
come to his own. The last forty years have altered things
"considerably, and though some men may pretend to despise novels,"
now-a-days they must take them into account. Wise and learned persons
"formations of the stratified rocks of the earth's crust, giving to"
"each formation its maximum thickness wherever found, amounts to"
not less than forty miles. Knowing how slowly sediments accumulate
"upon the sea floor, we must believe that the successive cycles"
which the earth has seen stretch back into a past almost
"inconceivably remote, and measure tens of millions and perhaps"
even hundreds of millions of years.
HOW THE FORMATIONS ARE CORRELATED AND THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD MADE
"UP. Arranged in the order of their succession, the formations of"
the earth's crust would constitute a connected record in which the
"geological history of the planet may be read, and therefore known"
as the GEOLOGICAL RECORD. But to arrange the formations in their
natural order is not an easy task. A complete set of the volumes
of the record is to be found in no single region. Their leaves and
chapters are scattered over the land surface of the globe. In one
"area certain chapters may be found, though perhaps with many"
"missing leaves, and with intervening chapters wanting, and these"
absent parts perhaps can be supplied only after long search
through many other regions.
Adjacent strata in any region are arranged according to the LAW OF
"SUPERPOSITION, i.e. any stratum is younger than that on which it"
"was deposited, just as in a pile of paper, any sheet was laid"
later than that on which it rests. Where rocks have been
"disturbed, their original attitude must be determined before the"
law can be applied. Nor can the law of superposition be used in
identifying and comparing the strata of different regions where
the formations cannot be traced continuously from one region to
the other.
The formations of different regions are arranged in their true
to be the case.
Grey had a faint misgiving at the first that no manager might be
forthcoming to admit the dialogue to his boards; but there the old actor
knew his ground.  He succeeded in inviting two of the most successful
"managers to listen to a performance in the attic, without the"
accessories which would add much to the effect upon the stage; and even
"so the scene proved so telling, the acting of the Old Lion was so superb"
"in its quiet dignity, and Grey (who had learned and studied patiently"
"and diligently) went through his part with such spirit, such power, such"
"dramatic energy, that even his instructor was surprised at his success,"
and the managers exchanged glances of astonishment and pleasure.
It was just the sort of piece to catch the public favour at this
"juncture.  Marlborough was still the idol of the nation, and might be"
expected home some time before the winter closed—perhaps before
"Christmas itself.  The nation was discussing how to do him honour, and"
would flock to see a piece wherein his praises were so ably sung.
"""With a wig such as the Duke wears, and with military dress, Mr. Grey"
"could be made to look the very image of the great General,"" cried one."
"""He has something the same class of face—handsome, regular features,"
grace of action and bearing. He does but want to be transformed from
"fair to dark, and his acting of the Duke will bring down veritable"
"thunders of applause from all."""
"And then began a gratifying rivalry as to terms, in which the Old Lion"
sustained his part with dignity and firmness.  Both managers desired to
"secure this interlude for their respective theatres, and at the last it"
was settled that the performance was to be given two nights a week at
"Drury Lane, and two at Sadler’s Wells, the astute old actor retaining"
"from an atomizer, about one ounce, usually being enough for the painless"
"opening of abscesses or fistulae, but cocaine is better in our patients."
"_As an anesthetic_ it should be used in preference to chloroform, for"
"the smaller and young animals, especially dogs, which are easily killed"
by chloroform. Ether is less prompt in action but much safer than
"chloroform, as it never paralyzes a healthy heart; it should be inhaled"
"in as concentrated a form as possible, very little air being allowed, so"
"it will exert its effects quickly, in the dog; a light or fire of any"
"kind should not be allowed near, as ether is very inflammable and its"
vapor explosive. Always have a bottle of aqua ammonia fort. at hand as a
restorer.
ALCOHOL
"Alcohol is derived directly from fruit sugar, and indirectly from"
"starch. The grains, as wheat, rye, corn; and potatoes, supply starch"
most economically. The starch in these substances is converted into
"glucose by heating with very dilute sulphuric acid, or by fermentation"
with malt. Glucose is further acted upon by yeast containing the Torula
"cerevisiae, which converts 15 per cent of glucose into alcohol and"
carbonic dioxide. The weak alcohol resulting is subjected to repeated
distillation until sufficiently pure and concentrated. In the natural
"fermentation of fruit sugar in grape juice, during the formation of"
"wine, the amount of alcohol is self-limited to 15, rarely 20 per cent,"
since the ferment is killed by a larger amount of alcohol than this.
"DERIVATION.--The official alcohol is derived from rectified spirits, by"
"maceration, first with anhydrous potassium carbonate, then freshly fused"
"acres or even more. All fruit is delivered along the railway lines, and"
"the larger growers have tramways, the cars drawn by oxen or mules, to"
carry their fruit to the stipulated point. Notice is given the growers
"of the date on which the fruit will be called for, and within twelve to"
eighteen hours after it has been cut it is in the hold of the vessel. It
"is subjected to a rigid inspection at the docks, and the flaws for which"
whole bunches are rejected would often be quite undiscernible to the
ordinary observer.

"The banana is one of the few fruits which are free from insect pests,"
"being protected by its thick, bitter skin. If allowed to ripen in the"
"open, however, it speedily falls a prey to a multitude of egg-laying"
"insects. The tree itself is not so immune. Lately a small rodent,"
"something like the gopher of our American states, has discovered that"
banana roots are good to eat. From time immemorial he lived in the
"jungle, burrowing and nibbling the roots of the plants there, but in an"
unlucky moment for the fruit companies he discovered that tunneling in
soil that had been worked was easier and the roots of the cultivated
banana more succulent than his normal diet. Therefore a large
importation of scientists from Europe and the United States to find some
way of eradicating the industrious pest that has attacked the chief
"industry of the tropics at the root, so to speak."
[Illustration: COFFEE PLANT AT BOUQUETTE]
Baron Humboldt is said to have first called the attention of civilized
"people to the food value of the banana, but it was one of the founders"
"of the United Fruit Company, a New England sea captain trading to Colon,"
who first introduced it to the general market in the United States. For
a time he carried home a few bunches in the cabin of his schooner for
It must have been somewhat painful for Erasmus that his friend had so
"far surpassed him in power and position, and was now called to bring by"
diplomatic means the solution which he himself would have liked to see
"achieved by ideal harmony, good will and toleration. He had never"
"trusted Aleander, and was more than ever on his guard against him. As a"
"humanist, in spite of brilliant gifts, Aleander was by far Erasmus's"
"inferior, and had never, like him, risen from literature to serious"
theological studies; he had simply prospered in the service of Church
magnates (whom Erasmus had given up early). This man was now invested
with the highest mediating powers.
To what degree of exasperation Erasmus's most violent antagonists at
Louvain had now been reduced is seen from the witty and slightly
malicious account he gives Thomas More of his meeting with Egmondanus
"before the Rector of the university, who wanted to reconcile them. Still"
"things did not look so black as Ulrich von Hutten thought, when he wrote"
"to Erasmus: 'Do you think that you are still safe, now that Luther's"
"books are burned? Fly, and save yourself for us!'"
Ever more emphatic do Erasmus's protestations become that he has nothing
to do with Luther. Long ago he had already requested him not to mention
"his name, and Luther promised it: 'Very well, then, I shall not again"
"refer to you, neither will other good friends, since it troubles you'."
"Ever louder, too, are Erasmus's complaints about the raving of the monks"
"at him, and his demands that the mendicant orders be deprived of the"
right to preach.
In April 1521 comes the moment in the world's history to which
"Christendom has been looking forward: Luther at the Diet of Worms,"
"holding fast to his opinions, confronted by the highest authority in the"
Empire. So great is the rejoicing in Germany that for a moment it may
was regarded by the Germans.
It was in 1837 that Ferrier married the young lady with whom he had so
long corresponded. The marriage was in all respects a happy one. Mrs.
"Ferrier's gifts and graces, inherited from her father, will not soon be"
"forgotten, either in St. Andrews where she lived so long, or in"
"Edinburgh, the later home of her widowhood. One whose spirits were less"
gay might have found a husband whose interests were so completely in
his work--and that a work in which she could not share--difficult to
"deal with; but she possessed understanding to appreciate that work, as"
"well as humour, and could accommodate herself to the circumstances in"
"which she found herself; while he, on his part, entered into the gaiety"
on occasion with the best. A friend and student of the St. Andrews'
"days writes of Ferrier: 'He married his cousin Margaret, Professor's"
"Wilson's daughter, and I don't doubt that a shorthand report of their"
courtship would have been better worth reading than nine hundred and
"ninety-nine out of every thousand courtships, for she had wit as well"
"as beauty, and he was capable of appreciating both. No more charming"
"woman have I ever seen or heard making game of mankind in general, and"
in particular of pedants and hypocrites. She would even laugh at her
"husband on occasion, but it was dangerous for any volunteer to try to"
help her in that sport. A finer-looking couple I have never seen.[5]
"[5] Another sister married William Edmondstoune Aytoun, the"
poet. It was regarding Professor Aytoun's proposal for Miss
Wilson's hand that the following story is told. When the
"engagement was being formed, Aytoun somewhat demurred to"
"interviewing the father of the lady, and she herself"
undertook the mission. Presently she returned with a card
"pinned upon her breast bearing the satisfactory inscription,"
"'With the author's compliments'! Aytoun, as is well known,"
"was extremely plain, and it was of his bust in the"
"the blood-stained House. Certain of the nobles, gathered together,"
resolve upon an alliance for the purpose of restoring a strong
"government. The Duke of Albany, however, thinks to snatch power to"
himself from this opportunity. _Scene 2._--Report is made of the
"suppression of the rebellion, but this news is immediately followed by a"
report of Albany's attempted usurpation of the throne. Coalition for his
"defeat is agreed upon, and the play ends with the mournful soliloquy of"
that aged counsellor who first opposed the division of the throne and
"now sees, as the consequence of that fatal act, his country, torn to"
"pieces by civil strife, left an easy prize for an ambitious conqueror."
Hereto it comes when kings will not consent
"To grave advice, but follow wilful will."
"This is the end, when in fond princes' hearts"
"Flattery prevails, and sage rede[51] hath no place:"
"These are the plagues, when murder is the mean"
To make new heirs unto the royal crown....
"And this doth grow, when lo, unto the prince,"
"Whom death or sudden hap of life bereaves,"
"No certain heir remains, such certain heir,"
"As not all only is the rightful heir,"
But to the realm is so made known to be;
"And troth thereby vested in subjects' hearts,"
To owe faith there where right is known to rest.
"This last quotation, interesting in itself as containing a"
"recommendation to Queen Elizabeth to marry, or at least name her"
"successor, will also serve as a specimen of the new verse, Blank Verse,"
"which here, for the first time, finds its way into English drama."
Meeting with small favour from writers skilful in the stringing together
"of rhymes, it suffered comparative neglect for some years until Marlowe"
taught its capacities to his own and future ages. With Sackville's stiff
"intrusions of molten rock, and have been broken, crumpled, and"
"crushed, and left in interlocking masses so confused that their"
true arrangement can usually be made out only with the greatest
difficulty if at all. The condition of this body of crystalline
rocks is due to the fact that they have suffered not only from the
"faultings, foldings, and igneous intrusions of their time, but"
"necessarily, also, from those of all later geological ages."
At present three leading theories are held as to the origin of
these basal crystalline rocks.
1. They are considered by perhaps the majority of the geologists
who have studied them most carefully to be igneous rocks intruded
in a molten state among the sedimentary rocks involved with them.
In many localities this relation is proved by the phenomena of
contact; but for the most part the deformations which the rocks
have since suffered again and again have been sufficient to
destroy such evidence if it ever existed.
2. An older view regards them as profoundly altered sedimentary
"strata, the most ancient of the earth."
3. According to a third theory they represent portions of the
"earth's original crust; not, indeed, its original surface, but"
deeper portions uncovered by erosion and afterwards mantled with
sedimentary deposits. All these theories agree that the present
foliated condition of these rocks is due to the intense
metamorphism which they have suffered.
It is to this body of crystalline rocks and the stratified rocks
"involved with it, which form a very small proportion of its mass,"
"that the term ARCHEAN (Greek, ARCHE, beginning) is applied by many"
"mongrel château. His force was scattered out of sight, though for the"
"most part not out of hearing of each other. It was indeed true that,"
"owing to his excellent dispositions, and the fortunate situation of the"
"balconies, he was able to command every part of the castle enclosure,"
and especially the doors by which it was most likely that the chief
attempt would be made.
"So occupied had Rollo been with his affairs, both private and of a"
"military character, that he had actually wholly forgotten the presence"
"of the Queen-Regent, her daughter and husband, within the palace of La"
Granja. And this though he had come all that way across two of the
wildest provinces of Spain for the sole purpose of securing their
persons and transporting mother and daughter to the camp of Don Carlos.
"Nevertheless so instant was the danger which now overhung every one,"
that their intended captor had ceased to think of anything but how to
preserve these royal lives and to keep them from the hands of the
ruthless gipsies of the hills.
But circumstances quickly recalled the young man to his primary
"purpose, and taught him that he must not trust too much to those whose"
interests were opposed to his own.
"Rollo, as we have said, had reserved no station for himself, but"
"constantly circulated round all the posts of his little army, ready at"
any time to add himself to the effective forces of the garrison at any
threatened point. It was while he was thus passing from balcony to
balcony on the second or defending storey that his quick ear caught the
sound of a door opening and shutting on the floor beneath.
"""Ah,"" thought Rollo to himself, suspiciously, ""the Queen and her people"
are safe in their chambers on this floor. No person connected with the
defence ought to be down there. This is either treachery or the enemy
"of the laxity of morals in the time of Julius II. (1503-'13), that her"
friends did not hesitate to bury the famous Aspasia of that age in
"this church (St. Gregorio), and to inscribe upon her tomb: 'Imperia,"
"cortisana Romana, quæ digna tanto nomine, raræ inter homines formæ"
"specimen dedit.'... But this monument has now been removed.""[18]"
"Most of the facts above cited, especially those concerning the legends"
"and the Popes, except where specific acknowledgment is made to other"
"writers, have been drawn from Hare's invaluable _Walks in Rome_. Let us"
conclude the list with the testimonies of a few eminent men of
unimpeachable competence and veracity as to the character and influence
of the Roman Catholic Church as a system.
"[Sidenote: Macaulay, Dickens and Gladstone on the Influence of"
Romanism.]
"In the first chapter of his _History of England_, Lord Macaulay says:"
"""From the time when the barbarians overran the Western Empire to the"
"time of the revival of letters, the influence of the Church of Rome"
"had been generally favorable to science, to civilization, to good"
"government. But during the last three centuries, to stunt the growth"
"of the human mind has been her chief object. Throughout Christendom,"
"whatever advance has been made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth,"
"and in the arts of life, has been made in spite of her, and has"
everywhere been in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest and
"most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule, been sunk in"
"poverty, in political servitude, and in intellectual torpor, while"
"Protestant countries, once proverbial for sterility and barbarism,"
"have been turned by skill and industry into gardens, and can boast of"
"a long list of heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever,"
"knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are, and what, four hundred"
"years ago, they actually were, shall now compare the country round Rome"
As teachers and workers it is an incontestable fact that Indian officers
"have distinguished themselves very highly, and anything which"
discriminates between Europeans and Indians in the way of pay and
prospects is most undesirable. A sense of injustice is ill-calculated to
bring about that harmony which is so necessary among all the members of
"an educational institution, professors and students alike."
"83, 632 (VIII) _Relations of the service with the Indian Civil Service"
and with other services._--As regards the relations with the Indian
"Civil Service, I am under the impression that they are somewhat"
"strained, but of this I have no personal experience."
"83, 633 (IX) _Other points._--I have endeavoured to give my opinion on"
the definite questions which have been asked. There is another aspect of
"educational work in India which I think of the highest importance,"
though I am not exactly sure whether it falls within the terms of
reference to the Royal Commission. I think that all the machinery to
improve the higher education in India would be altogether ineffectual
unless India enters the world movement for the advancement of knowledge.
And for this it is absolutely necessary to touch the imagination of the
people so as to rouse them to give their best energies to the work of
"research and discovery, in which all the nations of the world are now"
engaged. To aim at anything less will only end in a lifeless and
mechanical system from which the soul of reality has passed away. On
"this subject I could have said much, but I will confine myself to one"
point which I think at the present juncture to be of importance. The
Government of Bengal has been foremost in a tentative way in encouraging
research. What is necessary is the extension and continuity of this
enlightened policy.
"83, 634. _Supplementary Note._--I would like to add a few remarks to"
"make the meaning of paragraphs 83, 627 and 83, 631 in my note more"
Till a few weeks ago it seemed that I shall have to look to the future
for securing the necessary expansion of scope and for permanence of the
Institute. But response is being awakened in answer to the need. The
Government have most generously intimated their desire to sanction
grants towards placing the Institute on a permanent basis the extent of
which will be proportionate to the public interest in this national
undertaking. Out of many who would feel an interest in securing adequate
"Endowment, the very first donations have come from two of the merchant"
"princes of Bombay, to whom I had been personally unknown."
A note that touched me deeply came from some girl students of the
"Western Province, enclosing their little contribution ""for the service"
"of our common motherland."" It is only the instinctive mother-heart that"
can truly realise the bond that draws together the nurselings of the
common homeland. There can be no real misgiving for the future when at
the country's call man offers the strength of his life and woman her
"active devotion, she most of all, who has the greater insight and larger"
faith because of the life of austerity and self-abnegation. Even a
solitary wayfarer in the Himalayas has remembered to send me message of
cheer and good hope. What is it that has bridged over the distance and
blotted out all differences? That I will come gradually to know; till
then it will remain enshrined as a feeling. And I go forward to my
"appointed task, undismayed by difficulties, companioned by the kind"
"thoughts of my well-wishers, both far and near."
INDIA'S SPECIAL APTITUDES IN CONTRIBUTION TO SCIENCE
The excessive specialisation of modern science in the West has led to
the danger of losing sight of the fundamental fact that there can be but
"one truth, one science which includes all the branches of knowledge. How"
"blood excited them, and they besprinkled the statue of the goddess and her"
"votaries with it, or even drank it. Finally a prophetic delirium would"
"overcome them, and they foretold the future."
"This ferocious worship aroused curiosity at first, but it never gained"
great consideration. It appears that the Cappadocian Bellona joined the
"number of divinities that were subordinated to the _Magna Mater_ and, as"
"the texts put it, became her follower (_pedisequa_).[12] The brief"
"popularity enjoyed by this exotic _Mâ_ at the beginning of our era shows,"
"nevertheless, the growing {55} influence of the Orient, and of the"
religions of Asia Minor in particular.
After the establishment of the empire the apprehensive distrust in which
the worship of Cybele and Attis had been held gave way to marked favor and
the original restrictions were withdrawn. Thereafter Roman citizens were
"chosen for _archigalli_, and the holidays of the Phrygian deities were"
solemnly and officially celebrated in Italy with even more pomp than had
been displayed at Pessinus.
"According to Johannes Lydus, the Emperor Claudius was the author of this"
change. Doubts have been expressed as to the correctness of the statement
"made by this second-rate compiler, and it has been claimed that the"
transformation in question took place under the Antonines. This is
erroneous. The testimony of inscriptions corroborates that of the Byzantine
"writer.[13] In spite of his love of archaism, it was Claudius who permitted"
"this innovation to be made, and we believe that we can divine the motives"
of his action.
"Under his predecessor, Caligula, the worship of Isis had been authorized"
after a long resistance. Its stirring festivities and imposing processions
gained considerable popularity. This competition must have been disastrous
"to the priests of the _Magna Mater_, who were secluded in their temple on"
meet with reward in life and that they end in establishing a habit of
"drudgery, but, after all, we must have poetic justice in a Fairy Story,"
"occasionally, at any rate."
"Another such story is “Jesper and the Hares.” Here, however, it is"
"not at first resourcefulness that helps the hero, but sheer kindness"
"of heart, which prompts him first to help the ants, and then to"
"show civility to the old woman, without for a moment expecting any"
"material benefit from such actions. At the end, he does win by his own"
"ingenuity and resourcefulness, and if we regret that his _trickery_"
"has such wonderful results, we must remember that the aim was to win"
"the princess for herself, and that there was little choice left him. I"
consider the end of this story to be one of the most remarkable I have
found in my long years of browsing among Fairy Tales. I should suggest
"stopping at the words: “The Tub is full,” as any addition seems to"
destroy the subtlety of the story.[28]
"Another story of this kind, admirable for children from six years and"
"upwards, is “What the Old Man does is always Right.” Here, perhaps,"
the entire lack of common sense on the part of the hero would serve
"rather as a warning than a stimulating example, but the conduct of"
the wife in excusing the errors of her foolish husband is a model of
resourcefulness.
In the story of “Hereafter--this”[29] we have just the converse: a
perfectly foolish wife shielded by a most patient and forbearing
"husband, whose tolerance and common sense save the situation."
One of the most important elements to seek in our choice of stories is
"that which tends to develop, eventually, a fine sense of humour in a"
"child. I purposely use the word “eventually,” because I realise first"
"that humour has various stages, and that seldom, if ever, can you"
"relation between Literature and the Parliament House, if less close"
"than it had been, was more apparent than it is to-day, and"
distinguished Scottish judges and advocates mingled in the afternoon in
"the drawing-room, where she sat in a great arm-chair, with such men as"
Sellar and Stevenson and Grant and Shairp and Tulloch. But her
personality was the supreme bond.
"Those days are over, and with them has passed away much of what"
stimulated one to read in the _Institutes_ or the _Philosophical
Remains_. But for the historian of British philosophy Ferrier
"continues as a prominent figure. He it was who first did, what Stirling"
and Green did again at a stage later on--make a serious appeal to
thoughtful people to follow no longer the shallow rivulets down which
"the teaching of the great German thinkers had trickled to them, but to"
seek the sources. If as a guide to those sources we do not look on him
"to-day as adequate, we are not the less under a deep obligation to him"
for having been the pioneer of later guides. What Ferrier wrote about
"forty years ago has now become readily accessible, and what has been"
got by going there is in process of rapid and complete assimilation.
The opinions which were in 1856 regarded by the authorities of the Free
and United Presbyterian Churches as disqualifying Ferrier for the
"opportunity of influencing the mind of the youth of Edinburgh, from the"
"Chair of Logic and Metaphysics in succession to Sir William Hamilton,"
are regarded by the present generation of Presbyterians as the main
reliable bulwark against the attacks of unbelievers. If one may judge
"by the essays in the recent volume called _Lux Mundi_, the same"
phenomenon displays itself among the young High Church party in
England. The Time-Spirit is fond of revenges.
But even for others than the historians of the movement of Thought the
books of Ferrier remain attractive. There is about them a certain
atmosphere in which everything seems alive and fresh. Their author was
Chief among the objections is the clause which would give the United
States authority to seize the vessels in time of war. It is quite
evident that this power might be employed to the complete destruction of
the Fruit Company’s trade; in fact to its practical extinction as a
business concern. A like power existing in England or Germany would not
"be of equal menace to any single company flying the flag of that nation,"
for there the government’s needs could be fully supplied by a proper
apportionment of requisitions for ships among the many companies. But
with the exceedingly restricted merchant marine of the United States the
danger of the enforcement of this right would be an ever-present menace.
It is for this reason that the Fruit Company steamers fly the British
"flag, and the American in Colon may see, as I did one day, nine great"
ocean ships in the port with only one flying the stars and stripes. The
opening of the canal will not wholly remedy this.

THE END OF THE CROCODILE]
"In all respects save the registry of its ships, however, the Fruit"
Company is a thoroughly American concern and to its operations in the
Caribbean is due much of the good feeling toward the United States which
"is observable there. In 1912 it carried 1,113,741 tons of freight, of"
"which 359,686 was general freight, carried for the public in addition"
"to company freight. This is a notable public service, profitable no"
doubt but vital to the interests of the American tropics. It owns or
"holds under leases 852,650 acres, and in 1912 carried to the United"
"States about 25,000,000 bunches of bananas, and 16,000,000 bunches to"
Great Britain and the Continent. Viewed from the standpoint of the
consumer its work certainly has operated to cheapen bananas and to place
them on sale at points where they were never before seen. The banana has
not participated in the high cost of living nor has one company
The man in the street looks out for a newspaper which may strengthen
his own party proclivities. He expects to find political questions
"discussed, but so far as religion is concerned he accepts without"
"knowing it the current convention of the pressman, and imbibes a"
semi-sceptical atmosphere without misgiving or suspicion.
"And yet, as Sir Leslie Stephen saw, every theory of duty depends upon"
Belief or Disbelief in the Divinity of Christ. We may talk of duty to
"Society, duty to the Race, duty to Posterity, duty to Civilization;"
but the plain man will recall the question of Sir Boyle Roche: “I do
"not understand, Mr. Speaker, all this talk about our duty to"
Posterity! What has Posterity ever done for us?”
You cannot control conduct by asserting that a man owes a debt to an
"abstraction which you vivify by printing it with a capital letter,"
and there remains always the question of the dying Lucretius--
“Thy duty? What is duty? Fare thee well.”
"The problem, then, which we have to solve is--how to arrest the"
"attention of the average man to those Christian principles, of which"
the acceptance or definite refusal will determine the course of
civilization during the next twenty years.
"The mere assertion of authority will not suffice, and men are not"
impressed in favour of Catholic doctrine simply by dignified ceremony
and Ritual. We have only to look across the English Channel to be
assured of this. Frenchmen have not been encouraged to study the
evidences of Christianity. Bishops and priests have only advertised
sceptical books by forbidding their perusal to the faithful; and as
"the devout have been instructed to live by faith, but not how to give"
"a reason for the faith which is in them, in the result M. Viviani’s"
vertebrae. In most modern fishes and in all higher vertebrates the
notochord is gradually removed as the bodies of the vertebrae are
formed about it; but in the Devonian fishes it persists through
maturity and the vertebrae remain incomplete.
THE SKELETON IS CARTILAGINOUS. This also is an embryological
"characteristic. In the Devonian fishes the vertebrae, as well as"
"the other parts of the skeleton, have not ossified, or changed to"
"bone, but remain in their primitive cartilaginous condition."
THE TAIL FIN IS VERTEBRATED. The backbone runs through the fin and
is fringed above and below with its vertical rays. In some fishes
"with vertebrated tail fins the fin is symmetric, and this seems to"
be the primitive type. In others the tail fin is unsymmetric: the
"backbone runs into the upper lobe, leaving the two lobes of"
unequal size. In most modern fishes (the teleosts) the tail fin is
"not vertebrated: the spinal column ends in a broad plate, to which"
the diverging fin rays are attached.
"But along with these embryonic characters, which were common to"
"all Devonian fishes, there were other structures in certain groups"
which foreshadowed the higher structures of the land vertebrates
"which were yet to come: air sacs which were to develop into lungs,"
and cartilaginous axes in the side fins which were a prophecy of
limbs. The vertebrates had already advanced far enough to prove
the superiority of their type of structure to all others. Their
internal skeleton afforded the best attachment for muscles and
enabled them to become the largest and most powerful creatures of
"the time. The central nervous system, with the predominance given"
"to the ganglia at the fore end of the nerve cord,--the brain,--"
already endowed them with greater energy than the invertebrates;
"and, still more important, these structures contained the"
"philosophy on the one hand, or to propound theories startling in their"
unorthodoxy on the other. And still we may claim for him a place--and
"an honourable place--amongst the other Famous Scots, for the simple"
reason that after a long century of wearisome reiteration of tiresome
platitudes--platitudes which had lost their original meaning even to
"the utterers of them, and which had become misleading to those who"
heard and thought they understood--Ferrier had the courage to strike
"out new lines for himself, to look abroad for new inspiration, and to"
hand on these inspirations to those who could work them into a truly
national philosophy.
"In Scotland, where, in spite of politics, traditions are honoured to a"
"degree unknown to most other countries, family and family associations"
count for much; and in these James Ferrier was rich. His father was a
"Writer to the Signet, John Ferrier by name, whose sister was the famous"
"Scottish novelist, Susan Ferrier, authoress of _The Inheritance_,"
"_Destiny_, and _Marriage_. Susan Ferrier did for high life in Scotland"
"what Gait achieved for the humbler ranks of society, and attained to"
considerable eminence in the line of fiction which she adopted. Her
"works are still largely read, have recently been republished, and in"
their day were greatly admired by no less an authority than Sir Walter
"Scott, himself a personal friend of the authoress.[1] Ferrier's"
"grandfather, James Ferrier, also a Writer to the Signet, was a man of"
great energy of character. He acted in a business capacity for many
years both to the Duke of Argyle of the time and to various branches of
"the Clan Campbell: it was, indeed, through the influence of the Duke"
that he obtained the appointment which he held of Principal Clerk of
"Session. James Ferrier, like his daughter, was on terms of intimate"
"friendship with Sir Walter Scott, with whom he likewise was a colleague"
"in office. Scott alludes to him in his Journal as 'Uncle Adam,' the"
"name of a character in Miss Ferrier's _Inheritance_, drawn, as she"
"herself acknowledges, from her father. He died in 1829, at which time"
"also to undergo the ascendancy of her religion. As a matter of fact, her"
"fervent believers maintained her sanctuaries, despite the law, on the very"
"Capitol. Under Cæsar, Alexandrian astronomers had reformed the calendar of"
"the pontiffs, and Alexandrian priests soon marked the dates of Isis"
holidays upon it.
The decisive step was taken soon after the death of Tiberius. Caligula
erected the great temple of Isis Campensis on the Campus Martius probably
"in the year 38.[29] In order to spare the sacerdotal susceptibilities, he"
founded it outside of the sacred enclosure of the city of Servius. Later
Domitian made one of Rome's most splendid monuments of that temple. From
"that time Isis and Serapis enjoyed the favor of every imperial dynasty, the"
Flavians as well as the Antonines and the Severi. About the year 215
"Caracalla built an Isis temple, even more magnificent than that of"
"Domitian, on the Quirinal, in the heart of the city, and perhaps another"
"one on the Coelian. As the apologist Minucius Felix states, the Egyptian"
gods had become entirely Roman.[30]
The climax of their power seems to have been reached at the beginning of
the third century; later on the popular vogue and official support went to
"other divinities, like the Syrian Baals and the Persian {85} Mithras. The"
"progress of Christianity also deprived them of their power, which was,"
"however, still considerable until the end of the ancient world. The Isis"
processions that marched the streets of Rome were described by an eye
"witness as late as the year 394,[31] but in 391 the patriarch Theophilus"
"had consigned the Serapeum of Alexandria to the flames, having himself"
struck the first blow with an ax against the colossal statue of the god
that had so long been the object of a superstitious veneration. Thus the
"prelate destroyed the ""very head of idolatry,"" as Rufinus put it.[32]"
"As a matter of fact, idolatry received its death blow. The worship of the"
gods of the Ptolemies died out completely between the reigns of Theodosius

"V, however, brings Goodluck himself and explanations. That worthy man"
"finds his lady true, friendship is established all round, and Ralph and"
Merrygreek join the happy couple in a closing feast.
This bald outline perhaps makes sufficiently clear the great advance in
"plot structure. Within the play, however, are many other good things."
"The character of Ralph Roister Doister, 'a vain-glorious, cowardly"
"blockhead', as the list of dramatis personae has it, is thoroughly well"
"done: his heavy love-sighs, his confident elation, his distrust, his"
"gullibility, his ups and downs and contradictions, are all in the best"
"comic vein. Only second in fullness of portraiture, and truer to Nature,"
"is Dame Custance, who--if we exclude Melibaea as not native to English"
shores--may be said to bring into English secular drama honourable
"womanhood. Her amused indifference at first, her sharp reproof of her"
"maids who have allowed themselves to act as Ralph's messengers, her"
"gathering vexation at Ralph's tiresome wooing, her genuine alarm when"
she sees that his boastful words are accepted by the sea-captain as
truth--these are sentiments and emotions copied from a healthy and
"worthy model. Matthew Merrygreek, an unmistakable 'Vice' ever at Ralph's"
"elbow, is of all Vices the shrewdest striker of laughter out of a block"
of stupidity: it is from his ingenious brain that almost every absurd
"scene is evolved for the ridiculing of Ralph. Thoroughly human, and"
"quite assertive, are the lower characters, the maid-servants and"
"men-servants, Madge Mumblecrust, Tibet Talkapace, Truepenny, Dobinet"
Doughty and the rest. Need it be added that the battle in Act IV is pure
fooling? or that jolly songs enliven the scenes with their rousing
choruses (e.g. 'I mun be married a Sunday')? _Ralph Roister Doister_ is
an English comedy with English notions of the best way of amusing
English folk of the sixteenth century. With all its improvements it has
"no suggestion of the alien about it, as has the classically-flavoured"
"The procession of drunkards on Palm Sunday, the saving of the"
"shipwrecked crew, the old men waiting for the travelling cart while the"
"drivers are still drinking, all these are Dutch genre pieces of the best"
sort.
We like to speak of the realism of the Renaissance. Erasmus is certainly
a realist in the sense of having an insatiable hunger for knowledge of
the tangible world. He wants to know things and their names: the
"particulars of each thing, be it never so remote, such as those terms of"
games and rules of games of the Romans. Read carefully the description
of the decorative painting on the garden-house of the _Convivium
"religiosum_: it is nothing but an object lesson, a graphic"
representation of the forms of reality.
"In its joy over the material universe and the supple, pliant word, the"
Renaissance revels in a profusion of imagery and expressions. The
"resounding enumerations of names and things, which Rabelais always"
"gives, are not unknown to Erasmus, but he uses them for intellectual and"
useful purposes. In _De copia verborum ac rerum_ one feat of varied
power of expression succeeds another--he gives fifty ways of saying:
"'Your letter has given me much pleasure,' or, 'I think that it is going"
to rain'. The aesthetic impulse is here that of a theme and variations:
to display all the wealth and mutations of the logic of language.
"Elsewhere, too, Erasmus indulges this proclivity for accumulating the"
treasures of his genius; he and his contemporaries can never restrain
themselves from giving all the instances instead of one: in _Ratio verae
"theologiae_, in _De pronuntiatione_, in _Lingua_, in _Ecclesiastes_. The"
"collections of _Adagia_, _Parabolae_, and _Apophthegmata_ are altogether"
"based on this eagerness of the Renaissance (which, by the way, was an"
inheritance of the Middle Ages themselves) to luxuriate in the wealth of
"the tangible world, to revel in words and things."
"metamorphic rocks, is composed of mica and quartz in alternating"
"wavy folia. All gradations between it and phyllite may be traced,"
and in many cases we may prove it due to the metamorphism of
slates and shales. It is widespread in New England and along the
eastern side of the Appalachians. TALC SCHIST consists of quartz
"and TALC, a light-colored magnesian mineral of greasy feel, and so"
soft that it can be scratched with the thumb nail.
"HORNBLENDE SCHIST, resulting in many cases from the foliation of"
"basic igneous rocks, is made of folia of hornblende alternating"
with bands of quartz and feldspar. Hornblende schist is common
over large areas in the Lake Superior region.
QUARTZ SCHIST is produced from quartzite by the development of
fine folia of mica along planes of shear. All gradations may be
found between it and unfoliated quartzite on the one hand and mica
schist on the other.
Under the resistless pressure of crustal movements almost any
"rocks, sandstones, shales, lavas of all kinds, granites, diorites,"
and gabbros may be metamorphosed into schists by crushing and
"shearing. Limestones, however, are metamorphosed by pressure into"
"marble, the grains of carbonate of lime recrystallizing freely to"
interlocking crystals of calcite.
These few examples must suffice of the great class of metamorphic
"rocks. As we have seen, they owe their origin to the alteration of"
both of the other classes of rocks--the sedimentary and the
"igneous--by heat and pressure, assisted usually by the presence of"
water. The fact of change is seen in their hardness arid
"cementation, their more or less complete recrystallization, and"
their foliation; but the change is often so complete that no trace
"outside, where an elaborate etiquette had made the rules even for the"
trees to grow in seemliness with a most gentlemanly existence. For him
were no disturbing peerings into human destiny--he raised no rough
"alarms by strenuous aims and vigorous thinking. Pretty, dandified,"
"he--always. Sinning easily enough, but always like a gentleman. Never"
"a crudity. As a perfumed fan fluttered by jewelled slender fingers,"
blowing cool fragrant airs that kiss the painted cheek of some
"frail beauty, he uttered his lines--obscene often, but by the most"
gentlemanly of innuendoes. The unmannerly thing was the only sin. The
display of a profound emotion was the depth of ill-breeding. So sang
"he, tunefully always, guiltless of all rough accent of originality;"
"sang of peacocks and green carnations and blue roses, of butterflies"
"and pools and dragonflies and souls, of ivory and silver, and of"
"dawn and dusk and dew, and white shoulders sweet, beauties who moved"
languidly with rustle of silk--so wafted he to you nothing more vibrant
than whisper of women and scent of perfumed chambers and flowers and
"bowers and rose and amarynth and asphodel and daffodil, of moonlight"
and music and kiss and gavotte and little tiny things--and always in
the most gentlemanly manner. He milked the unicorn. Always a would-be
"suggestion of mysterious deep-hid symbolism that ended where it began,"
and at most only the dark hint of well-bred tragedy.
"He moved impatiently now, as impatiently as he might, complaining that"
the shop-window into which he deigned to cast his reflection was tinted
with amethyst.
"“Come, Greppel,” said he--“let us gaze at ourselves in another"
window--this is an ageing colour.”
Then came the terrible tragedy of a fire at a charity bazaar; a most
patrician function with much upper clergy in it was smitten with sudden
highly organized fauna-flora of to-day may be compared to the
"growth of some noble oak as it rises from the acorn, spreading"
loftier and more widely extended branches as it grows.
7. While higher and still higher types have continually been
"evolved, until man, the highest of all, appeared, THE LOWER AND"
EARLIER TYPES HAVE GENERALLY PERSISTED. Some which reached their
culmination early in the history of the earth have since changed
only in slight adjustments to a changing environment. Thus the
"brachiopods, a type of shellfish, have made no progress since the"
"Paleozoic, and some of their earliest known genera are represented"
by living forms hardly to be distinguished from their ancient
ancestors. The lowest and earliest branches of the tree of life
have risen to no higher levels since they reached their climax of
development long ago.
8. A strange parallel has been found to exist between the
evolution of organisms and the development of the individual. In
the embryonic stages of its growth the individual passes swiftly
through the successive stages through which its ancestors evolved
during the millions of years of geologic time. THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE INDIVIDUAL RECAPITULATES THE EVOLUTION OF THE RACE.
The frog is a typical amphibian. As a tadpole it passes through a
stage identical in several well-known features with the maturity
"of fishes; as, for example, its aquatic life, the tail by which it"
"swims, and the gills through which it breathes. It is a fair"
inference that the tadpole stage in the life history of the frog
"represents a stage in the evolution of its kind,--that the"
Amphibia are derived from fishlike ancestral forms. This inference
is amply confirmed in the geological record; fishes appeared
before Amphibia and were connected with them by transitional
there was at least a chance that they might bring to a successful
conclusion the complex and difficult task which was before them.

"They now drew near to the palace, which, as one descends the mountains,"
"is approached first. The town of San Ildefonso lay further to the right,"
an indistinguishable mass of heaped roofs and turrets without a light or
the vestige of a street apparent in the gloom. It seemed to Rollo a
strange thing to think of this stricken town lying there with its dead
"and dying, its empty tawdry lodgings from which the rich and gay of the"
"Court had fled so hastily, leaving all save their most precious"
"belongings behind, the municipal notices on the door, white crosses"
"chalked on a black ground, while nearer and always nearer approached the"
fell gipsy rabble intent on plunder and rapine.
"Even more strange, however, seemed the case of the royal palace of La"
Granja. Erected at infinite cost after the pattern of Versailles and
"Marly, the smallness of its scale and the magnificence of its natural"
surroundings caused it infinitely to surpass either of its models in
"general effect. It had, however, never been intended for defence, nor"
had the least preparation been made in case of attack. It was doubtless
"presumed that whenever the Court sojourned there, the royal personages"
"would arrive with such a guard and retinue as, in that lonely place,"
would make danger a thing to be laughed at.
But no such series of circumstances as this had ever been thought of;
the plague which had fallen so heavily and as it seemed mysteriously and
instantaneously upon the town; the precincts of the palace about to be
invaded by a foe more fell than Frank or Moor; the guards disappeared
"like snow in the sun, and the only protection of the lives of the"
"Queen-Regent and her daughter, a band of Carlists sent to capture their"
"England the priest solemnly instructs the god-parents of the child,"
"“Ye shall call upon him to hear sermons,” but for the most part the"
"admonition is in vain. As a matter of fact, he picks up his religious"
notions from the newspaper press. And the newspaper press is not now
controlled by men who have a distinct and definite belief in
"Christianity. It depends upon Finance, and financiers have other"
"interests. The assertion of the Psalter, “Notus in Judæa” has been"
"changed now-a-days into an interrogation, and we ask, “In Jewry _is_"
God known?” Let any man who has an intimate acquaintance with the
newspaper world run over in his mind the names of the great newspaper
"proprietors, the editors of our journalistic press, the writers of"
"leading articles, the rising young journalists; and when he has"
"excepted a few Irishmen, who may happen to remain faithful to the"
"Roman Catholic Church, to which they owe their education, how many men"
"will he find who honestly believe the Nicene Creed, and are habitually"
present on the first day of the week at the Breaking of the Bread?
The tone of the daily paper is tolerant. There is no rude hostility
"displayed towards definite Christian doctrines, but the toleration is"
"politely contemptuous. “All wise men are of the same religion, and"
what that religion is wise men do not say.”
It is true that in political matters the press has less power than it
used to have. A magnate of finance cannot now seriously affect public
"opinion, though he may buy newspaper after newspaper, and sweep out"
the editorial staff to supply their places with men of his own choice.
One wealthy wirepuller has other plutocrats to reckon with in
"questions of party politics, and a newspaper man who is dismissed by"

done for those who left school for ever when they were twelve years
old.
"A generation ago Lord Sherbrooke, on the extension of the franchise,"
told his contemporaries that it was time to begin “to educate our
masters”--but we have not gone very far in our instruction of
"Christian Sociology, though as yet we have not adopted the Utilitarian"
"basis of morals accepted by the French Republic, and endeavoured to"
establish principles of duty towards man without any reference
whatever to a duty towards God.
Can any one be surprised if the plain man be perplexed when he is
called upon to decide questions of economy and morality without any
guiding principle? As a matter of fact he makes no such effort.
"“Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision, for the day of the"
"Lord is near in the valley of decisions,” but the sun and the moon are"
"darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining. The puzzled popular"
"vote is but as the swing of the pendulum, first to this side, then to"
"the other. “These fellows have been no good, let us give the others a"
show.”
Yet assuredly there is a principle which is guidance and strength if
only men could discern it. There are Teachers who can tell men of its
"beneficent power, but they are as yet few in number, and their voices"
"are not sufficiently strong. When once these can get a hearing, men"
welcome their evangel and find in it a guide of life.
"I am persuaded that just as Bishop Butler, when he perused the preface"
"of his _Analogy_, had no prescience of the young fellow of Lincoln,"
who was in a few years to give the Christian faith a fresh hold in the
"hearts of the common people, who gladly heard him, so in our time many"
of our Bishops seem unable to perceive the dawn of another “day of the
"could be at peace, and the monk answered for the governor that all his"
"land was at their disposal. 'Let the Nats choose,' he said; 'all the"
"country is before them.' So the Nats chose, and said that they would"
"have Popa Mountain, and the monk agreed."
"The Nats then left the tree and went away, far away inland, to the great"
"Popa Mountain, and took up their abode there, and all the people there"
"feared and reverenced them, and even made to their honour two statues"
with golden heads and set them up on the mountain.
"This is the story of the Popa Nats, the greatest Nats of all the"
"country of Burma, the guardian spirits of the mysterious mountain. The"
"golden heads of the statues are now in one of our treasuries, put there"
"for safe custody during the troubles, though it is doubtful if even then"
"anyone would have dared to steal them, so greatly are the Nats feared."
And the hunters and the travellers there must offer to the Nats little
"offerings, if they would be safe in these forests, and even the young"
man must obtain permission from the Nats before he marry.
"I think these stories that I have told, stories selected from very many"
"that I have heard, will show what sort of spirits these are that the"
Burmese have peopled their trees and rivers with; will show what sort of
"religion it is that underlies, without influencing, the creed of the"
"Buddha that they follow. It is of the very poetry of superstition, free"
"from brutality, from baseness, from anything repulsive, springing, as I"
"have said, from their innate sympathy with Nature and recognition of the"
life that works in all things. It always seems to me that beliefs such
"as these are a great key to the nature of a people, are, apart from all"
"interest in their beauty, and in their akinness to other beliefs, of"
great value in trying to understand the character of a nation.

and evening to gaze at the carved and lofty front of his house--by St.
Sebald's or behind the new Cathedral--and wondered how long the fire
would spare it. The magistrates who had staked all--their own and the
"city's--on this cast, went about with stern, grave faces and feared"
"almost to meet the public eye. With a doubled population, with a huge"
"army to feed, with order to keep, with houses and wives and daughters"
"of their own to protect, with sack and storm looming luridly in the"

"One man only, and him I saw as we went home from the Burg. It was near"

"At that time Count Tilly's crooked, dwarfish figure and pale horse's"
"face, and the great hat and boots which seemed to swallow him up, were"
fresh in my mind; and sometimes I had wondered whether this other
"great commander were like him. Well, I was to know; for through the"
"crowd at the junction of these four roads, while we stood waiting to"
"pass, there came a man on a white horse, followed by half a score of"
others on horseback; and in a moment I knew from the shouting and the
way women thrust papers into his hands that we saw the King of Sweden.
He wore a plain buff coat and a grey flapped hat with a feather; a
"tall man and rather bulky, his face massive and fleshy, with a close"
moustache trimmed to a point and a small tuft on his chin. His aspect
"was grave; he looked about him with a calm eye, and the shouting did"
"not seem to move him. They told me that it was Ba[=n]er, the Swedish"
"General, who rode with him, and our Bernard of Weimar who followed."
"But my eye fell more quickly on Count Leuchtenstein, who rode after,"
"with the great Chancellor Oxenstierna; in him, in his steady gaze and"
"serene brow and wholesome strength, I traced the nearest likeness to"
the king.
tender. Bowels confined. The column had to move at 5 A.M. the
"next morning, when the temperature was still near freezing, and"
during the day continuous fighting prevented any chance of

"_Post-mortem condition._--Belly not distended, dull anteriorly"
"in patches, and right flank dull throughout. When the belly was"
"opened, extensive adhesion of omentum and intestine enclosing"
"numerous collections of pus were disclosed, and on disturbing"
the adhesions a large collection of turbid blood-stained fluid
was set free from the right loin. The great omentum was much
"thickened and matted, with deposition of thick patches of"
lymph; very firm recent adhesions also united numerous coils of
"small intestine. The pus was foetid, but no appreciable"
quantity of intestinal contents was detected in it. The lower
"half or more of the small intestine was injected, reddened, and"
thickened. The wounds which were situated in the lower part of
"the jejunum and ileum were multiple, and seven perforations"
were detected; besides these the intestine was marked by
"bruises, and some gutter slits affecting the serous and"
muscular coats only. Considerable ecchymosis surrounded these
"latter. The clean perforations were circular, less than 1/4"
"inch in diameter, and for the most part closed by eversion of"
"the mucous membrane. Intestinal contents were not apparent, but"
escaped freely on manipulation of the bowel.

Vomiting commenced almost immediately after reception of the
"injury, and the bowels acted frequently. This condition"
public and attributed to Kodama containing some military indications on
the plan of an invasion of Indo-China is a perfect forgery. I have
exposed elsewhere several technical errors therein which would never
appear in an authentic official document. But whether it is authentic or
"not, I do not attach any importance to the matter, from a political"
point of view at least. It is the duty of all the military and naval
"authorities to keep themselves ready for any emergency. For example,"
France ought to keep herself always prepared for any possible
"difficulties which may arise on her frontiers in the east, and in the"
"south, and on the western coasts; the same with Germany, with Austria,"
"with Italy, even with the United States."
"It appears to me that, if the general staff-office of France or of"
"Germany, or the military or naval authorities of any country whatever,"
were to remain without the least knowledge as to what measure should be
"taken in case of a danger, they would be neglecting their duty to their"
"country. I can then say that all the Japanese officers, both in the army"
and in the navy ought to study constantly the measures which Japan
should take in any emergency. I believe it is the same in every country
"in Europe. This, however, does not belong to the sphere of practical"
politics. It is the duty of statesmen and politicians to maintain a
"friendly relationship with all other countries as far as possible; and,"
"consequently, to keep absolute control over their armies and navies. The"
"army and navy ought to serve as instruments and machines in their hands,"
"and not they, the civilians, become the instruments of the army and"
navy. You may be quite assured that in Japan the army and navy are the
"machines of the statesmen, and that the statesmen are not their"
machines.
Can the fabrication of the so-called Kodama report be demonstrated
by a precise fact?
"spacious days of Great Elizabeth, than in a tale of modern life such"
as _Two Years Ago_. His Broad Church Catholic teaching does not always
"find its way to the man in the street, and Henry Kingsley, whose life"
"was so different from that of his illustrious clerical brother, has"
more of human interest in his stories.
"The novel with a purpose, and especially with a religious purpose,"
"fails only, when it does fail, because the author’s knowledge of the"
"average man in his sins and his temptations to sin, is altogether"
incommensurate with his familiarity with the great religious and
social problems of which his story would suggest a solution.
It is often supposed that the men do not care to find the subject of
"religion introduced in fiction, that they resent religion in a novel,"
as children resent the administration of a medicinal powder in a
spoonful of jam; but the expert witness of publishers demolishes this
"opinion. After all, the religious claim is insistent, and life is"
untruly depicted when men and women are described in a story as
uninfluenced by it. There is something unreal in a book which has no
Sundays in it. Critical opinion as expressed in the notices of books
"in the daily papers, and in more weighty reviews, is very misleading,"
simply because the reviewers are generally very young men or women
who know more or less of literature but very little of life. The wrath
of the young man fresh from the University at the success of those
books which do not ignore the spiritual needs of men and women amuses
the experienced author.
“Faugh!” cries Mr. Jones of Balliol; “another batch of sin and
sentiment!” “The Christian creed and the conjugal copula! Religion and
Patchouli!” Yet the critic forgets that those who would reach the

"character which men have to solve, each one for himself."
"her ears all the way. The sergeant and Rollo came next, with Mortimer"
"and Etienne behind, a naked blade in the hand of each, for Rollo had"

"to mean his faithful Manchegan knife, to which he trusted more than to"
any sword of Toledo that ever was forged.
At any other time they could not have advanced a score of yards without
"being brought to a stand-still by the challenge of a sentry, the whistle"
"of a rifle bullet, or the simultaneous turning out of the guard. But now"
no such danger was to be apprehended. All was still as a graveyard
before cock-crow.
"It is hard, in better and wiser days, when things are beginning to be"
"traced to their causes, to give any idea of the effect of the first"
appearance of Black Cholera among a population at once so simple and so
superstitious as that of rural Spain. The inhabitants of the great
"towns, the Cristino armies in the field, the country-folk of all"
opinions were universally persuaded that the dread disease was caused by
the monks in revenge for the despites offered to them; especially by the
"hated Jesuits, who were supposed to have thrown black cats alive into"
rivers and wells in order to produce disease by means of witchcraft and
diabolical agency.
So universal was this belief that so soon as the plague broke out in any
"city or town the neighbouring monasteries were immediately plundered,"
and the priors and brethren either put to death or compelled to flee for
their lives.
Some such panic as this had stampeded the troops stationed in and about
"the little town of San Ildefonso, when the first cases of cholera proved"
fatal little more than a week before. A part of these had rushed away to
"plunder the rich monastery of El Parral a few miles off, lying in the"
linen paper were held so high that the expense of an extra leaf was
considered an unnecessary luxury. In these books that which took the
"place of the title was at the end, the colophon being in evidence,"
"indicating the name of the illuminator, if not always that of the"
"printer. As was the case with the manuscript book, the volume began"
"with the phrase, ""Here beginneth...."" Later came piratical reprints,"
which resulted in making the critical reader insist upon having each
"volume stamped with the printer's name or mark, as a guarantee of"
reliable workmanship.
The first definite step in the direction of the title-page is marked
"by bibliographers in a little volume printed by Arnold Ther Hoernen,"
"of Cologne, in 1470. It consisted of an introduction at the head of"
"a page, the major part of which was left blank. Whether the printer"
"forgot to place the usual introduction at the head of the first page,"
"and took this way to remedy his error, is not known."
"In general, different faces of type should never be combined upon the"
"title-page, the variations being secured by using smaller sizes of the"
"same face, or harmonizing fonts. Capitals and lower-case letters can be"
successfully combined on the title-page only as a result of care and
"thought, the best title-pages usually being all in lower-case or all in"
caps and small caps. A two-color title-page is rarely a success unless
"it was originally composed with two colors in mind, instead of being"
set up in black and arbitrarily split up for colors.
"The decoration should never overbalance the type, and this applies"
as well to the question of borders on decorated books. No matter how
"beautiful, if the decoration overbalances the type, the volume or the"
title-page ceases to be an example of typography and becomes something
answerable only to itself.
of the governor and appeals to the National Assembly of France for
some guarantee of civil liberty. His name is at the head of this
"petition, a sufficiently daring step for a junior lieutenant on"
furlough. But his patriotism and audacity carry him still further. He
"journeys to Bastia, the official capital of his island, and is"
concerned in an affray between the populace and the royal troops
"(November 5th, 1789). The French authorities, fortunately for him, are"
nearly powerless: he is merely requested to return to Ajaccio; and
"there he organizes anew the civic force, and sets the dissident"
islanders an example of good discipline by mounting guard outside the
house of a personal opponent.
Other events now transpired which began to assuage his opposition to
"France. Thanks to the eloquent efforts of Mirabeau, the Corsican"
patriots who had remained in exile since 1768 were allowed to return
and enjoy the full rights of citizenship. Little could the friends of
"liberty at Paris, or even the statesman himself, have foreseen all the"
consequences of this action: it softened the feelings of many
"Corsicans towards their conquerors; above all, it caused the heart of"
Napoleon Buonaparte for the first time to throb in accord with that of
the French nation. His feelings towards Paoli also began to cool. The
conduct of this illustrious exile exposed him to the charge of
ingratitude towards France. The decree of the French National
"Assembly, which restored him to Corsican citizenship, was graced by"
acts of courtesy such as the generous French nature can so winningly
"dispense. Louis XVI. and the National Assembly warmly greeted him, and"
"recognized him as head of the National Guard of the island. Yet,"
"amidst all the congratulations, Paoli saw the approach of anarchy, and"
"behaved with some reserve. Outwardly, however, concord seemed to be"
"assured, when on July 14th, 1790, he landed in Corsica; but the hatred"
long nursed by the mountaineers and fisherfolk against France was not
"to be exorcised by a few demonstrations. In truth, the island was"
infer from the vast thicknesses of its rocks and the
unconformities which part them. We know that during its long
"periods land masses again and again rose from the sea, were worn"
"low, and were submerged and covered with the waste of other lands."
But the formations of separated regions cannot be correlated
"because of the absence of fossils, and nothing more can be made"
"out than the detached chapters of local histories, such as the"
outline given of the district about Lake Superior.
The pre-Cambrian rocks show no evidence of any forces then at work
upon the earth except the forces which are at work upon it now.
The most ancient sediments known are so like the sediments now
being laid that we may infer that they were formed under
conditions essentially similar to those of the present time. There
is no proof that the sands of the pre-Cambrian sandstones were
swept by any more powerful waves and currents than are offshore
"sands to-day, or that the muds of the pre-Cambrian shales settled"
to the sea floor in less quiet water than such muds settle in at
"present. The pre-Cambrian lands were, no doubt, worn by wind and"
"weather, beaten by rain, and furrowed by streams as now, and, as"
"now, they fronted the ocean with beaches on which waves dashed and"
along which tidal currents ran.
Perhaps the chief difference between the pre-Cambrian and the
present was the absence of life upon the land. So far as we have
"any knowledge, no forests covered the mountain sides, no verdure"
"carpeted the plains, and no animals lived on the ground or in the"
air. It is permitted to think of the most ancient lands as deserts
of barren rock and rock waste swept by rains and trenched by
powerful streams. We may therefore suppose that the processes of
their destruction went on more rapidly than at present.
"had time to assert itself, I took advantage of a momentary reaction and"
"said: “Now, children, don't you think we can pay England the tribute"
of going back to England's greatest poet?” In a few minutes we were
"back in the heart of the Forest, and I can still hear the delightful"
intonation of those subdued voices repeating:
Golden lads and girls all must
Like chimney-sweepers come to dust.
It is interesting to note that the same problem that is exercising
us to-day was a source of difficulty to people in remote times. The
"following is taken from an old Chinese document, and has particular"
interest for us to-day.
“The Philosopher Mentius (born 371 B.C.) was left fatherless at a very
tender age and brought up by his mother Changsi. The care of this
prudent and attentive mother has been cited as a model for all virtuous
parents. The house she occupied was near that of a butcher: she
"observed at the first cry of the animals that were being slaughtered,"
"the little Mentius ran to be present at the sight, and that, on his"
"return, he sought to imitate what he had seen. Fearful lest his heart"
"might become hardened, and accustomed to the sights of blood, she"
removed to another house which was in the neighbourhood of a cemetery.
The relations of those who were buried there came often to weep upon
"their graves, and make their customary libations. The lad soon took"
pleasure in their ceremonies and amused himself by imitating them.
This was a new subject of uneasiness to his mother: she feared her
son might come to consider as a jest what is of all things the most
"serious, and that he might acquire a habit of performing with levity,"
"and as a matter of routine merely, ceremonies which demand the most"
exact attention and respect. Again therefore she anxiously changed the
"dwelling, and went to live in the city, opposite to a school, where her"
rise of temperature.
_Symptoms of hæmothorax._--In the more severe cases of primary bleeding
"the symptoms did not, as a rule, reach their full height until the third"
or fourth day after the injury. The patients then often suffered
"severely. The pulse and temperature rose, and to general symptoms of"
loss of blood were added: occasional lividity of countenance; severe
"dyspnoea, accompanied by inability to lie on the sound side or to"
assume the supine position; absence of respiratory movement on the
"injured side; pain, restlessness, cough, and sometimes continuance of"
"hæmoptysis, small clots usually being expectorated."
Accompanying these symptoms were the usual physical signs of fluid in
the pleura in differing degrees and combination. Dulness of varying
"extent up to complete absence of resonance on one side, often"
accompanied in the incomplete cases by well-marked skodaic resonance
"anteriorly. Loss of vocal resonance, and fremitus; oegophony, tubular"
respiration over the root of the lung or at the upper limit of the
"dulness, and more or less extensive displacement of the heart. Obvious"
"increase in girth, fulness of the intercostal spaces, or gravitation"
ecchymosis was rare. The latter was most common in instances in which
multiple fracture of the ribs existed (see fig. 83). I think the rarity
of the last sign must have been due to the early coagulation of the
"blood, and its retention by the pleura, as I saw well-marked gravitation"
ecchymosis in one or two cases of mediastinal hæmorrhage.
"The above complex of symptoms was common to all the cases, but in the"
"slighter ones they gave rise to little trouble, and cleared up with"
great rapidity.
"[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Gravitation Ecchymosis in a case of Hæmothorax,"
accompanying fracture of three ribs from within. The influence of the
carbonate of lime of the Algonkian limestones and marbles was
"extracted from sea water by organisms, as is done at present by"
"corals, mollusks, and other humble animals and plants, the life of"
"those ancient seas must have been abundant. Graphite, a soft black"
mineral composed of carbon and used in the manufacture of lead
"pencils and as a lubricant, occurs widely in the metamorphic pre-"
Cambrian rocks. It is known to be produced in some cases by the
"metamorphism of coal, which itself is formed of decomposed vegetal"
tissues. Seams of graphite may therefore represent accumulations
"of vegetal matter such as seaweed. But limestone, iron ores, and"
"graphite can be produced by chemical processes, and their presence"
"in the pre-Cambrian makes it only probable, and not certain, that"
life existed at that time.
PRE-CAMBRIAN FOSSILS. Very rarely has any clear trace of an
organism been found in the most ancient chapters of the geological
"record, so many of their leaves have been destroyed and so far"
have their pages been defaced. Omitting structures whose organic
"nature has been questioned, there are left to mention a tiny"
"seashell of one of the most lowly types,--a DISCINA from the pre-"
"Cambrian rocks of the Colorado Canyon,--and from the pre-Cambrian"
rocks of Montana trails of annelid worms and casts of their
"burrows in ancient beaches, and fragments of the tests of"
crustaceans. These diverse forms indicate that before the
"Algonkian had closed, life was abundant and had widely"
differentiated. We may expect that other forms will be discovered
as the rocks are closely searched.
PRE-CAMBRIAN GEOGRAPHY. Our knowledge is far too meager to warrant
an attempt to draw the varying outlines of sea and land during the
Archean and Algonkian eras. Pre-Cambrian time probably was longer
"than all later geological time down to the present, as we may"
"eclipses them."" The Revolution was evidently gaining completer hold"
"over his mind and was somewhat blurring his insular sentiments, when a"
rebuff from Paoli further weakened his ties to Corsica. Buonaparte had
"dedicated to him his work on Corsica, and had sent him the manuscript"
"for his approval. After keeping it an unconscionable time, the old man"
now coldly replied that he did not desire the honour of Buonaparte's
"panegyric, though he thanked him heartily for it; that the"
consciousness of having done his duty sufficed for him in his old age;
"and, for the rest, history should not be written in youth. A further"
request from Joseph Buonaparte for the return of the slighted
"manuscript brought the answer that he, Paoli, had no time to search"
"his papers. After this, how could hero-worship subsist?"
"The four months spent by Buonaparte at Auxonne were, indeed, a time of"
disappointment and hardship. Out of his slender funds he paid for the
"education of his younger brother, Louis, who shared his otherwise"
"desolate lodging. A room almost bare but for a curtainless bed, a"
"table heaped with books and papers, and two chairs--such were the"
surroundings of the lieutenant in the spring of 1791. He lived on
"bread that he might rear his brother for the army, and that he might"
"buy books, overjoyed when his savings mounted to the price of some"
coveted volume.
Perhaps the depressing conditions of his life at Auxonne may account
for the acrid tone of an essay which he there wrote in competition for
"a prize offered by the Academy of Lyons on the subject--""What truths"
"and sentiments ought to be inculcated to men for their happiness."" It"
was unsuccessful; and modern readers will agree with the verdict of
one of the judges that it was incongruous in arrangement and of a bad
"and ragged style. The thoughts are set forth in jerky, vehement"
"clauses; and, in place of the _sensibilité_ of some of his earlier"
"effusions, we feel here the icy breath of materialism. He regards an"
PREFACE:
BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.
AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as
"“unwholesome,” because, he said, they had “a faint smell of Patchouli"
"about them.” I am a little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a"
particularly favourite scent with me. If he had only chosen Peau
"d’Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or Lily of the Valley, with"
"which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve. Let me ask, then,"
"in republishing, with additions, a collection of little pieces, many of"
"which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being somewhat"
"deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern"
"itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my"
"critic means by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and"
"thus, to the truly devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively"
"noxious, at all events as needless. That is a point of view which I"
"quite understand, and its conclusion I hold to be absolutely logical. I"
"have the utmost respect for the people who refuse to read a novel, to"
"go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to have convictions and"
to live up to them. I understand also the point of view from which a
work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on behalf
of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those
"delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between"
"this form of art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and"
"timorous advances, and shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once"
"emancipated, and yet afraid of liberty. However you may try to convince"
"yourself to the contrary, a work of art can be judged only from two"
standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is measured entirely by
"its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is measured"
entirely by its art.
"moderate severity, and which recovered spontaneously."
The whole crux in diagnosis lay in the attempt to separate the two
"latter classes, and, personally, I must own to having been no nearer a"
"position of being able to form an opinion on this point, in the late"
than in the early stage of my stay in South Africa. The advent of
peritoneal septicæmia was in many instances the only determining moment.
"On this matter I can only add that, in civil practice, an exploratory"
abdominal section is often the only means of determination of a rupture
of the bowel wall.
With regard to the cases of suspected injury to the bowel which
"recovered spontaneously, the symptoms were somewhat special in their"
"comparative slightness, and in the limited nature of the local signs."
"Thus the pulse seldom rose to as much as 100 in rate, 80 was a common"
"average. Respiration was never greatly quickened, 24 was a common rate."
"The temperature rarely exceeded 100°. Vomiting was occasionally severe,"
"but usually not persistent, ceasing on the second day. A good quantity"
"of urine was passed. As to the local signs, these again were of a"
"limited nature; distension did not occur, or was slight; movement of the"
"abdominal wall was only restricted in the neighbourhood of the wound,"
"the affected area amounted to a quarter, or at most half, the abdominal"
"wall, and rigidity was localised to a similar segment. Local tenderness"
"usually existed; but, as a rule, there was little or no dulness to point"
to the occurrence either of fluid effusion or a considerable deposition
of lymph.
Again many of the patients suffered with very slight symptoms of
"constitutional shock, although there was considerable variation in this"
particular.
"(165*) Wounded at Graspan, sustaining a compound fracture of"
There was a very definite purpose in this somewhat rustically cunning
"and half ironical letter. Luther wanted, if possible, to make Erasmus"
"show his colours, to win him, the powerful authority, touchstone of"
"science and culture, for the cause which he advocated. In his heart"
Luther had long been aware of the deep gulf separating him from Erasmus.
"As early as March 1517, six months before his public appearance, he"
wrote about Erasmus to John Lang: 'human matters weigh heavier with him
"than divine,' an opinion that so many have pronounced about"
"Erasmus--obvious, and yet unfair."
"The attempt, on the part of Luther, to effect a _rapprochement_ was a"
reason for Erasmus to retire at once. Now began that extremely ambiguous
policy of Erasmus to preserve peace by his authority as a light of the
world and to steer a middle course without committing himself. In that
attitude the great and the petty side of his personality are
inextricably intertwined. The error because of which most historians
have seen Erasmus's attitude towards the Reformation either in far too
unfavourable a light or--as for instance the German historian
"Kalkoff--much too heroic and far-seeing, is that they erroneously regard"
him as psychologically homogeneous. Just that he is not. His
double-sidedness roots in the depths of his being. Many of his
utterances during the struggle proceed directly from his fear and lack
"of character, also from his inveterate dislike of siding with a person"
or a cause; but behind that is always his deep and fervent conviction
that neither of the conflicting opinions can completely express the
"truth, that human hatred and purblindness infatuate men's minds. And"
with that conviction is allied the noble illusion that it might yet be
"possible to preserve the peace by moderation, insight, and kindliness."
In April 1519 Erasmus addressed himself by letter to the elector
"Frederick of Saxony, Luther's patron. He begins by alluding to his"
cephalopods take a new departure. So far in all their various
"forms, whether straight, as the Orthoceras, or curved, or close-"
"coiled as in the nautilus, the septum, or partition dividing the"
"chambers, met the inner shell along a simple line, like that of"
the rim of a saucer. There now begins a growth of the septum by
"which its edges become sharply corrugated, and the suture, or line"
"of juncture of the septum and the shell, is thus angled. The group"
in which this growth of the septum takes place is called the
"GONIATITE (Greek GONIA, angle)."
VERTEBRATES. It is with the greatest interest that we turn now to
study the backboned animals of the Devonian; for they are believed
to be the ancestors of the hosts of vertebrates which have since
dominated the earth. Their rudimentary structures foreshadowed
"what their descendants were to be, and give some clue to the"
earliest vertebrates from which they sprang. Like those whose
"remains are found in the lower Paleozoic systems, all of these"
Devonian vertebrates were aquatic and go under the general
designation of fishes.
"The lowest in grade and nearest, perhaps, to the ancestral type of"
"vertebrates, was the problematic creature, an inch or so long, of"
"Figure 297. Note the circular mouth not supplied with jaws, the"
"lack of paired fins, and the symmetric tail fin, with the column"
"of cartilaginous, ringlike vertebrae running through it to the"
end. The animal is probably to be placed with the jawless lampreys
"and hags,--a group too low to be included among true fishes."
"OSTRACODERMS. This archaic group, long since extinct, is also too"
"lowly to rank among the true fishes, for its members have neither"
"jaws nor paired fins. These small, fishlike forms were cased in"
front with bony plates developed in the skin and covered in the
chaotic appear the happenings in Nature? Is nature a Cosmos! in which
"the human mind is some day to realise the uniform march of sequence,"
order and law? India through her habit of mind is peculiarly fitted to
"realise the idea of unity, and to see in the phenomenal world an orderly"
universe. This trend of thought led me unconsciously to the dividing
frontiers of different sciences and shaped the course of my work in its
"constant alternations between the theoretical and the practical, from"
the investigation of the inorganic world to that of organised life and
"its multifarious activities of growth, of movement, and even of"
sensation. On looking over a hundred and fifty different lines of
"investigations carried on during the last twenty-three years, I now"
discover in them a natural sequence. The study of Electric Waves led to
the devising of methods for the production of the shortest electric
waves known and these bridged over the gulf between visible and
invisible light; from this followed accurate investigation on the
"optical properties of invisible waves, the determination of the"
"Erasmus, and professor of divinity at Louvain, had, in 1514, in the name"
"of his faculty, rebuked Erasmus in a letter for the audacity of the"
"_Praise of Folly_, his derision of divines and also his temerity in"
correcting the text of the New Testament. Erasmus had defended himself
elaborately. At present war was being waged in a much wider field: for
"or against Reuchlin, the great Hebrew scholar, for whom the authors of"
the _Epistolae obscurorum virorum_ had so sensationally taken up the
cudgels. At Louvain Erasmus was regarded with the same suspicion with
which he distrusted Dorp and the other Louvain divines. He stayed during
"the remainder of 1516 and the first half of 1517 at Antwerp, Brussels"
"and Ghent, often in the house of Peter Gilles. In February 1517, there"
"came tempting offers from France. Budaeus, Cop, Étienne Poncher, Bishop"
"of Paris, wrote to him that the king, the youthful Francis I, would"
"present him with a generous prebend if he would come to Paris. Erasmus,"
"always shy of being tied down, only wrote polite, evasive answers, and"
did not go.
"once that nothing was to be expected of Eugenio, whose ancient and"
tottering limbs could hardly support the weight of his body. But there
was more hope of the two others. They proved to be stout young fellows
"from the neighbourhood, and professed the utmost eagerness for a bout"
with the gipsies. From their youth they had been accustomed to the use
of firearms--it is to be feared without due licence--in the royal
hunting preserves of Peñalara and the Guadarrama.
"But this made no difference to Rollo, who instantly set about equipping"
"them with the necessary arms, and inquiring minutely about the"
fastenings of the lower doors and windows. These it appeared were
"strong. The doors themselves were covered without with sheet-iron, while"
all the windows were protected not only by shutters but by solid
stanchions of iron sunk in the wall.
"On the whole Rollo was satisfied, and next questioned the servants"
concerning the state of the town and whether any assistance was to be
"hoped for from that quarter. In this, however, he was disappointed. It"
appeared that the whole municipality of San Ildefonso was so utterly
"plague-stricken that scarce an able-bodied man remained, or so much as a"
halfling boy capable of shouldering a musket. Only the women stood still
"in the breach, true nursing mothers, not like her of Ramah, refusing to"
"be comforted, but continuing rather to tend the sick and dying till they"
"themselves also died--aye, even shrouding the dead and laying out the"
corpses. A faithful brother or two of the Hermitage abode to carry the
last Sacraments of the Church through the deserted and grass-grown
"streets, though there were few or none now to fall on their knees at the"
"passage of _Su Majestad_, or to uncover the head at the melancholy"
tolling of the funeral bell.
With characteristic swiftness of decision Rollo made up his mind that
the best plan for the defence of the palace would be to place his scanty
"At one point, indeed, they passed near enough to distinguish in the far"
"north the snow-flecked buttresses of the Sierra de Moncayo. But these,"
"they knew, were the haunts of their Carlist allies. The towns and"
"villages of the plain, however, were invariably held by Nationals, and"
"it had often gone hard with them, had not Sergeant Cardono detached"
"himself from the cavalcade, and, venturing alone into the midst of the"
"enemy, by methods of his own produced the materials for many an"
"excellent meal. At last, one day the Sergeant came back to the party"
"with an added gloom on his long, lean, leathern-textured face. He had"
"brought with him an Estramaduran ham, a loaf of wheaten bread, and a"
double string of sausages. But upon his descending into the temporary
"camp which sheltered the party in the bottom of a _barranco_, or deep"
crack in the parched plateau overgrown with scented thyme and dwarf
"oak, it became obvious that he had news of the most serious import to"
communicate.
"He called Rollo aside, and told him how he had made his way into a"
"village, as was his custom, and found all quiet--the shops open, but"
"none to attend to them, the customs superintendent in his den by the"
"gate, seated on his easy chair, but dead--the presbytery empty of the"
"priest, the river bank dotted with its array of worn scrubbing boards,"
"but not a washerwoman to be seen. Only a lame lad, furtively plundering,"
had leaped backward upon his crutch with a swift drawing of his knife
and a wolfish gleam of teeth. He had first of all warned the Sergeant to
"keep off at his peril, but had afterwards changed his tone and confessed"
"to him that the plague was abroad in the valley of the Duero, and that"
he was the only being left alive in the village save the vulture and the
prowling dog.
"""The plague!"" Sergeant Cardono had gasped, like every Spaniard stricken"
sick at the very sound of the word.
the only true consummation of such love was wedlock.
This conception necessarily implied the equality of men with their gods
in the future life; and that future equality was sometimes represented
as no more than a return to that which was in the beginning. ‘One is
the race of men with the race of gods; for one is the mother that gave
"to both our breath; yet are they sundered by powers wholly diverse, in"
"that mankind is as naught, but heaven is builded of brass that abideth"
ever unshaken[1523].’ So sang Pindar of the past and of the present;
but the Orphic tablet which has been already quoted carries on the
thought into the future:
"‘Out of the pure I come, Pure Queen of Them Below,"
Eukles and Eubouleus and the other Gods immortal.
"For I also avow me that I am of your blessed race,"
But Fate laid me low....’
So far with Pindar. But the dead man’s claims do not end there: ‘I was
"admitted to the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the Underworld’; already"
had he received a foretaste of that divine wedlock which implied
"equality with the gods; and so there comes the answer, ‘Happy and"
"Blessed One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
This idea commended itself even to thinkers who did not believe in
"bodily survival after death. Plato, in the _Phaedo_, where above all"
things is taught the perishable nature of the body and the immortality
"of the soul alone, yet avails himself of the belief that the pure among"
mankind shall attain even to godhead hereafter. To him the pure are
"not the initiated indeed, but the earnest strivers after wisdom. In"
his theory of retributive metempsychosis he surmises that those who
have followed the lusts of the flesh shall hereafter enter the ranks of
asses and other lustful beasts; that those who have wrought violence
and the habit of meditation without allowing the mind to dissipate
"itself. Inspired by his visits to the ancient Universities, at Taxila,"
"at Nalanda and at Conjevaram, Dr. Bose had the strongest confidence that"
India would soon see a revival of those glorious traditions. There will
soon rise a Temple of Learning where the teacher cut off from worldly
"distractions would go on with his ceaseless pursuit after truth, and"
"dying, hand on his work to his disciples. Nothing would seem laborious"
"in his inquiry; never is he to lose sight of his quest, never is he to"
let it go obscured by any terrestrial temptation. For he is the Sanyasin
"spirit, and India is the only country where so far from there being a"
conflict between science and religion. Knowledge is regarded as religion
itself. Such a misuse of science as is now unfortunately in evidence in
the West would be impossible here. Had the conquest of air been achieved
"in India, her very first impulse would be to offer worship at every"
temple for such a manifestation of the divinity in man.
ECONOMIC DANGER OF INDIA
One of the most interesting events in his tour round the world was his
"stay in Japan, where he had ample opportunity of becoming acquainted"
with the efforts of the people and their aspirations towards a great
future. No one can help being filled with admiration for what they have
"achieved. In materialistic efficiency, which in a mechanical era is"
"regarded as an index of civilisation, they have even surpassed their"
German teachers. A few decades ago they had no foreign shipping and no
manufacture. But within an incredibly short time their magnificent lines
of steamers have proved so formidable a competitor that the great
American line in the Pacific will soon be compelled to stop their
"sailings. Their industries again, through the wise help of the State and"
other adventitious aids are capturing foreign markets. But far more
admirable is their foresight to save their country from any embroilment
towards one of its intermediate halting places. It also brought
"home to me vividly the inter-tribal character of this institution,"
which unites in one common and strongly emotional interest so many
"scattered communities. That night, as we learnt afterwards, a good"
number of canoes had anchored on the outlying deserted islands of the
"Amphletts, waiting for the rest of the fleet to arrive. When we came"
"that evening to Nabwageta, the news had already been received of the"
"important event, and the whole village was astir."
"Next day, the weather was particularly fine and clear, with the distant"
"mountains wreathed only in light cumuli, their alluring outlines"
"designed in transparent blue. Early in the afternoon, with a blast of"
"conch shell, a Dobuan waga, in full paint and decoration, and with the"
"rich pandanus mat of the sail glowing like gold against the blue sea,"
"came sailing round the promontory. One after the other, at intervals"
"of a few minutes each, other canoes came along, all sailing up to"
"some hundred yards from the beach, and then, after furling the sail,"
paddling towards the shore (see Plate XL). This was not a ceremonial
"approach, as the aim of the expedition this time did not embrace the"
"Amphletts, but was directed towards the Trobriands only, Vakuta,"
and Sinaketa; these canoes had put in only for an intermediate
"halt. Nevertheless, it was a great event, especially as the canoes"
of Nabwageta were going to join with the fleet later on. Out of the
"sixty or so Dobuan canoes, only about twenty-five with some 250 men in"
"them had come to Nabwageta, the others having gone to the big village"
"of Gumasila. In any case, there were about five times as many men"
gathered in the village as one usually sees. There was no Kula done
"at all, no conch-shells were blown on the shore, nor do I think were"
any presents given or received by either party. The men sat in groups
"round their friends' houses, the most distinguished visitors collected"
"about the dwelling of Tobwa'ina, the main headman of Nabwageta."
"expect an appreciation of fine humour from a normal child, that is,"
from an elemental mind. It seems as if the rough-and-tumble element
were almost a necessary stage through which children must pass--a
"stage, moreover, which is normal and healthy; but up to now we have"
"quite unnecessarily extended the period of elephantine fun, and though"
we cannot control the manner in which children are catered for along
"this line in their homes, we can restrict the folly of appealing too"
strongly or too long to this elemental faculty in our schools. Of
"course, the temptation is strong, because the appeal is so easy. But"
there is a tacit recognition that horse-play and practical jokes are
no longer considered an essential part of a child's education. We note
"this in the changed attitude in the schools, taken by more advanced"
"educationists, towards bullying, fagging, hazing, etc. As a reaction,"
"then, from more obvious fun, there should be a certain number of"
"stories which make appeal to a more subtle element, and in the chapter"
"on the questions put to me by teachers on various occasions, I speak"
more in detail about the educational value of a finer humour in our
stories.
At some period there ought to be presented in our stories the
"superstitions connected with the primitive history of the race, dealing"
"with the Fairy (proper), giants, dwarfs, gnomes, nixies, brownies"
and other elemental beings. Andrew Lang says: “Without our savage
ancestors we should have had no poetry. Conceive the human race born
"into the world in its present advanced condition, weighing, analysing,"
examining everything. Such a race would have been destitute of poetry
and flattened by common sense. Barbarians did the _dreaming_ of the
world.”
But it is a question of much debate among educationists what should
be the period of the child's life in which these stories are to be
presented. I myself was formerly of opinion that they belonged to
"everyone of them was murdered, including the negro hangman, with the"
"exception of one man, who was sent with a written message to the Governor"
to tell him that in future L'Ollonais would kill every Spaniard he met
with.
"Joining with a famous filibuster, Michael de Basco, L'Ollonais soon"
"organized a more important expedition, consisting of a fleet of eight"
"vessels and 400 men. Sailing to the Gulf of Venezuela in 1667, they"
"entered the lake, destroying the fort that stood to guard the entrance."
Thence sailing to the city of Maracaibo they found all the inhabitants had
fled in terror. The filibusters caught many of the inhabitants hiding in
"the neighbouring woods, and killed numbers of them in their attempts to"
force from the rest the hiding-places of their treasure. They next marched
"upon and attacked the town of Gibraltar, which was valiantly defended by"
"the Spaniards, until the evening, when, having lost 500 men killed, they"
"surrendered. For four weeks this town was pillaged, the inhabitants"
"murdered, while torture and rape were daily occurrences. At last, to the"
"relief of the wretched inhabitants, the buccaneers, with a huge booty,"
"sailed away to Corso Island, a place of rendezvous of the French"
"buccaneers. Here they divided their spoil, which totalled the great sum of"
"260,000 pieces of eight, which, when divided amongst them, gave each man"
"above one hundred pieces of eight, as well as his share of plate, silk,"
and jewels.
"Also, a share was allotted for the next-of-kin of each man killed, and"
extra rewards for those pirates who had lost a limb or an eye. L'Ollonais
"had now become most famous amongst the ""Brethren of the Coast,"" and began"
to make arrangements for an even more daring expedition to attack and
"plunder the coast of Nicaragua. Here he burnt and pillaged ruthlessly,"
committing the most revolting cruelties on the Spanish inhabitants. One
example of this monster's inhuman deeds will more than suffice to tell of.
It happened that during an attack on the town of San Pedros the buccaneers
"1783-4. According to his schoolfellow, Bourrienne, these mimic"
"fortifications were planned by Buonaparte, who also directed the"
"methods of attack and defence: or, as others say, he reconstructed"
"the walls according to the needs of modern war. In either case, the"
incident bespeaks for him great power of organization and control. But
there were in general few outlets for his originality and vigour. He
"seems to have disliked all his comrades, except Bourrienne, as much as"
they detested him for his moody humours and fierce outbreaks of
temper. He is even reported to have vowed that he would do as much
harm as possible to the French people; but the remark smacks of the
story-book. Equally doubtful are the two letters in which he prays to
be removed from the indignities to which he was subjected at
"Brienne[7]. In other letters which are undoubtedly genuine, he refers"
"to his future career with ardour, and writes not a word as to the"
bullying to which his Corsican zeal subjected him. Particularly
noteworthy is the letter to his uncle begging him to intervene so as
"to prevent Joseph Buonaparte from taking up a military career. Joseph,"
"writes the younger brother, would make a good garrison officer, as he"
"was well formed and clever at frivolous compliments--""good therefore"
"for society, but for a fight--?"""
Napoleon's determination had been noticed by his teachers. They had
"failed to bend his will, at least on important points. In lesser"
details his Italian adroitness seems to have been of service; for the
"officer who inspected the school reported of him: ""Constitution,"
"health excellent: character submissive, sweet, honest, grateful:"
conduct very regular: has always distinguished himself by his
application to mathematics: knows history and geography passably: very
weak in accomplishments. He will be an excellent seaman: is worthy to
"enter the School at Paris."" To the military school at Paris he was"
"accordingly sent in due course, entering there in October, 1784. The"
change from the semi-monastic life at Brienne to the splendid edifice
thus given and received is equivalent to that given by the Pope in
"person in St. Peter's. Truly a novel way of turning an honest penny!"""
"We hear that a rash churchman, not liking the facts just stated,"
"undertook to deny them in the public prints, when up spoke some English"
"gentlemen, who had been in Rome recently, and bowled the churchman over"

on the Corso.
One never touches this subject of the vast wealth of the papacy without
"calling to mind the well-known rejoinder of the great theologian,"
"Thomas Aquinas, when the Pope was showing him all his money and riches,"
"and said, ""You see, Thomas, the church cannot now say what it said in"
"early times, 'Silver and gold have I none.'"" ""No,"" answered Aquinas,"
"""nor can it say, 'Rise up and walk'"" (Acts iii. 6). This loss of"
"spiritual power, this loss of ability to minister salvation to others,"
is one of the most melancholy results of the corruption of the papacy.

"Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his recent book on _The Roman Catholic"
"Church in Italy_, which has received the hearty approval of the King"
"of Italy and his Prime Minister, says: ""There are few, I daresay,"
"who have looked into the history of the popes, no matter what their"
"religious faith may be, who will not agree with me when I say that it"
does not afford pleasant reading. One's intellect rebels against their
"preposterous claims and pretensions, and one's moral sense against"
"their character and lives. Amongst them there were some good men, some"
"learned men, and some really able men; but, taking them all in all,"
"they were, beyond doubt, amongst the lowest class of men to be found"
on the pages of history. To wade through their lives is to cross a
"pestiferous moral swamp of worldliness, simony, nepotism, concubinage,"
"personal animosities, sanguinary feuds, forged decretals, plunderings,"
"Of these towns David is the capital of the Chiriqui province, the"
portion of the republic in which cattle growing and agriculture have
"been most developed. Bocas del Toro is a banana port, dependent upon"
"that nutritious fruit for its very existence, and the center of the"
business of the United Fruit Company in Panama. At present the former
town is reached by a 300 mile water trip from Panama City; the latter by
boat from Colon. The government has under way plans for a railroad from
Panama to David which give every indication of being consummated.

"The soil of the Republic differs widely in its varying sections, from"
"the rich vegetable loam of the lowlands along the Atlantic Coast, the"
outcome of years of falling leaves and twigs from the trees to the swamp
"below, to the high dry lands of the savannas and the hillsides of the"
"Chiriqui province. All are undeniably fertile, that is demonstrated by"
the rapid and rank growth of the jungle. But opinions differ as to the
extent to which they are available for useful agriculture. Some hold
that the jungle soil is so rich that the plants run to wood and leaves
to the exclusion of fruits. Others declare that on the hillsides the
heavy rains of the rainy seasons wash away the surface soil leaving only
the harsh and arid substratum. This theory seems to be overthrown by the
fact that it is rare to see a hillside in all Panama not covered with
dense vegetation. A fact that is well worth bearing in mind is that
there has never been a systematic and scientific effort to utilize any
part of the soil of Panama for productive purposes that has not been a
success. The United Fruit Company in its plantations about Bocas del
Toro has developed a fruitful province and created a prosperous town. In
"the province of Cocle a German company has set out about 75,000 cacao"
"trees, 50,000 coffee bushes and 25,000 rubber trees, all of which have"
made good progress.
"It was a customary little ceremony, but in Risca's eyes it never lost"
"its grace and charm. To-night it seemed to have a deeper significance,"
"bringing Stella with her elfin charm into the midst of them, and thus"
exorcising the spirits of evil that held him in their torturing grip.
"He spoke but little at the meal, content to listen to the talk about"
"Stella, and curiously impatient when the conversation drifted into other"
"channels. Of his own tragedy no one spoke. On his arrival, Lady Blount,"
"with unwonted demonstration of affection, had thrown her arms round his"
"neck, and Sir Oliver had wrung his hand and mumbled the stiff Briton's"
incoherences of sympathy. He had not yet told them of his decision to go
to Australia.
"He broke the news later, in the drawing-room, abruptly and apropos of"
"nothing, as was his manner, firing his bombshell with the defiant air of"
"one who says, “There, what do you think of it?”"
"“I'm going to Australia next week, never to come back again,” said he."
There was a discussion. Sir Oliver commended him. The great dependencies
"of the empire were the finest field in the world for a young man,"
provided he kept himself outside the radius of the venomous blight of
the Colonial Office. To that atrophied branch of the imperial service
"the white administrator was merely a pigeon-holed automaton; the native,"
"black or bronze or yellow, a lion-hearted human creature. All the"
"murder, riot, rapine, arson, and other heterogeneous devilry that"
the latter cared to indulge in proceeded naturally from the noble
indignation of his generous nature. If the sensible man who was
appointed by the Government to rule over this scum of the planet called

3. _Wounds of the large intestine._--Injuries to every part of the large
"bowel were observed, and spontaneous recoveries were seen in all parts"
"except the transverse colon, which, as already remarked, is near akin"
to the small intestine with regard to its position and anatomical
arrangement.
"The only case of perforation of the vermiform appendix that I heard of,"
"one under the care of Mr. Stonham, died of peritoneal septicæmia."
Several cases of recovery from wounds of the cæcum and ascending colon
are recounted below. The only points of importance in the nature of the
"signs of these injuries were their primary insignificance, and the"
comparative frequency with which _local_ peritoneal suppuration followed
them. The absence of a similar sequence in some of the cases in which
"wounds of the small intestine were assumed, was, in my opinion, one of"
the strongest reasons for doubting the correctness of the diagnosis. It
is also a significant fact that injuries of the ascending colon--that is
"to say, of the portion of the large bowel which perhaps lies most free"
from the area occupied by the small intestine--were those which most
frequently recovered.
The following cases afford examples of the course followed in a number
"of injuries to the large intestine, and illustrate both the"
uncomplicated and the complicated modes of spontaneous recovery.
"No. 180 affords a good example of an extra-peritoneal injury, and of the"
especially fatal character of such lesions. This case was also one of my
surgical disappointments.
"Nos. 182, 183 are of great interest in several particulars. First, the"
"aperture of exit was large and allowed the escape of fæces, not a very"
"common feature in wounds not proving immediately fatal. Secondly, in"
"neither were any peritoneal signs observed. Thirdly, in each the exit"
"well as several other small independents, from disposing of a single"
plank.
The lumberjacks were not slow in putting two and two together. They
remembered rumors current in the big woods for many months of the fight
which had started between the trust and this man who was their boss. It
"was a fight to the finish, people said, in which one side or the other"
"must go under, From all appearances it looked to these earnest,"
simple-minded woodsmen as if Bainbridge would be vanquished unless he
could get that drive safely into the mill booms; and to that end they
"strained every nerve. They toiled from dawn to dark, staggering into"
camp each night so utterly weary that they sometimes fell asleep with
their supper half eaten before them; only to be up before daybreak to do
it all over again.
"It was a period of stress and strain, but it ended at last when the"
"drive was ushered into the Penobscot, to be seized by the strong current"
"and urged on toward the mills at Lancaster, that goal which had seemed a"
"little while ago so unattainable, yet which was now so near."
That very afternoon was perpetrated the crowning outrage. Bainbridge was
shot at from the bushes--shot at deliberately with an intent to kill
which was defeated only by the miracle of chance which made him bend
over to tighten a shoe lace at the precise moment of firing.
"Wild with fury, the men who were present dashed in pursuit of the"
"would-be assassins, but to no purpose. They were in the land of"
"civilization now, where there were motor cars. By the time the crowd of"
"rivermen had surged up the bank and plunged through the undergrowth, the"
"rascally tools of the trust were well away, leaving their pursuers to"
rage impotently that there was not a gun in the party with which the
tires could be punctured and the car stopped.
but more or less successfully suppressed action.']
"[Footnote 80: This seems to me to be the answer to the question, asked"
"by Freud, (_Die Traumdeutung_, p. 227), why we do not always dream of"
"inhibited movement. Freud considers that the idea of inhibited movement,"
"when it occurs in dreams, has no relation to the actual condition of the"
"dreamer's nervous system, but is simply an ideatory symbol of an erotic"
wish that is no longer capable of fulfilment. But it is certain that
sleep is not always at the same depth and that the various nervous groups
are not always equally asleep. A dream arising on the basis of partial
and imperfect sleep can scarcely fail to lead to the attempt at actual
"movement and the more or less complete inhibition of that movement,"
"presenting a struggle which is often visible to the onlooker, and is not"
purely ideatory.]
"[Footnote 81: This explanation, based on the depth and kind of the sleep,"
is entirely distinct from the theory of Aliotta (_Il Pensiero e la
"Personalità nei Sogni_, 1905), who believes that dreamers differ according"
"to their nervous type, the person of visual type assisting passively at"
"the spectacle of his dreams, while the person of motor type takes actual"
"part in them. I have no evidence of this, though I believe that dreams"
differ in accordance with the dreamer's personal type.]
[Footnote 82: Dugald Stewart argued that there is loss of control over
"the muscular system during sleep, and the body, therefore, is not subject"
to our command; volition is present but it cannot influence the limbs.
"Hammond argued, on the contrary, that Stewart was quite wrong; the reason"
"why voluntary movements are not performed during sleep is, he said, that"
volition is suspended. 'We do not will our actions when we are asleep. We
"imagine that we do, and that is all' (_Treatise on Insanity_, p. 205)."
"Dugald Stewart and Hammond, though their phraseology may have been too"
"metaphysical, were, from the standpoint I have adopted, both maintaining"
"definitely noble descent, and came of families which combined the"
intellectual gifts of Tuscany with the vigour of their later island
"home[3]. From her mother's race, the Pietra Santa family, Letizia"
"imbibed the habits of the most backward and savage part of Corsica,"
where vendettas were rife and education was almost unknown. Left in
"ignorance in her early days, she yet was accustomed to hardships, and"
often showed the fertility of resource which such a life always
"develops. Hence, at the time of her marriage, she possessed a firmness"
of will far beyond her years; and her strength and fortitude enabled
"her to survive the terrible adversities of her early days, as also to"
meet with quiet matronly dignity the extraordinary honours showered on
her as the mother of the French Emperor. She was inured to habits of
"frugality, which reappeared in the personal tastes of her son. In"
"fact, she so far retained her old parsimonious habits, even amidst the"
"splendours of the French Imperial Court, as to expose herself to the"
charge of avarice. But there is a touching side to all this. She seems
ever to have felt that after the splendour there would come again the
"old days of adversity, and her instincts were in one sense correct."
"She lived on to the advanced age of eighty-six, and died twenty-one"
years after the break-up of her son's empire--a striking proof of the
vitality and tenacity of her powers.
A kindly Providence veiled the future from the young couple. Troubles
fell swiftly upon them both in private and in public life. Their first
"two children died in infancy. The third, Joseph, was born in 1768,"
when the Corsican patriots were making their last successful efforts
"against their new French oppressors: the fourth, the famous Napoleon,"
"saw the light on August 15th, 1769, when the liberties of Corsica were"
being finally extinguished. Nine other children were born before the
"outbreak of the French Revolution reawakened civil strifes, amidst"
which the then fatherless family was tossed to and fro and finally
whirled away to France.
deputy for the twelve nobles of the island to the National Assembly of
"France. In a letter written on January 23rd, 1791, Buonaparte"
overwhelms this man with a torrent of invective.--He it was who had
betrayed his country to France in 1768. Self-interest and that alone
"prompted his action then, and always. French rule was a cloak for his"
"design of subjecting Corsica to ""the absurd feudal _régime_"" of the"
barons. In his selfish royalism he had protested against the new
"French constitution as being unsuited to Corsica, ""though it was"
exactly the same as that which brought us so much good and was wrested
"from us only amidst streams of blood.""--The letter is remarkable for"
"the southern intensity of its passion, and for a certain hardening of"
tone towards Paoli. Buonaparte writes of Paoli as having been ever
"""surrounded by enthusiasts, and as failing to understand in a man any"
"other passion than fanaticism for liberty and independence,"" and as"
duped by Buttafuoco in 1768.[14] The phrase has an obvious reference
"to the Paoli of 1791, surrounded by men who had shared his long exile"
"and regarded the English constitution as their model. Buonaparte, on"
"the contrary, is the accredited champion of French democracy, his"
furious epistle being printed by the Jacobin Club of Ajaccio.
After firing off this tirade Buonaparte returned to his regiment at
"Auxonne (February, 1791). It was high time; for his furlough, though"
"prolonged on the plea of ill-health, had expired in the preceding"
"October, and he was therefore liable to six months' imprisonment. But"
the young officer rightly gauged the weakness of the moribund
monarchy; and the officers of his almost mutinous regiment were glad
to get him back on any terms. Everywhere in his journey through
"Provence and Dauphiné, Buonaparte saw the triumph of revolutionary"
principles. He notes that the peasants are to a man for the
Revolution; so are the rank and file of the regiment. The officers
"are aristocrats, along with three-fourths of those who belong to ""good"
"society"": so are all the women, for ""Liberty is fairer than they, and"
only dormant; and they were certainly transmitted in their intensity
to the greatest scion of the race.
"In the year 1529 Francis Buonaparte, whether pressed by poverty or"
"distracted by despair at the misfortunes which then overwhelmed Italy,"
migrated to Corsica. There the family was grafted upon a tougher
branch of the Italian race. To the vulpine characteristics developed
under the shadow of the Medici there were now added qualities of a
more virile stamp. Though dominated in turn by the masters of the
"Mediterranean, by Carthaginians, Romans, Vandals, by the men of Pisa,"
"and finally by the Genoese Republic, the islanders retained a striking"
individuality. The rock-bound coast and mountainous interior helped to
preserve the essential features of primitive life. Foreign Powers
"might affect the towns on the sea-board, but they left the clans of"
the interior comparatively untouched. Their life centred around the
family. The Government counted for little or nothing; for was it not
the symbol of the detested foreign rule? Its laws were therefore as
naught when they conflicted with the unwritten but omnipotent code of
family honour. A slight inflicted on a neighbour would call forth the
"warning words--""Guard thyself: I am on my guard."" Forthwith there"
"began a blood feud, a vendetta, which frequently dragged on its dreary"
"course through generations of conspiracy and murder, until, the"
"principals having vanished, the collateral branches of the families"
were involved. No Corsican was so loathed as the laggard who shrank
"from avenging the family honour, even on a distant relative of the"
first offender. The murder of the Duc d'Enghien by Napoleon in 1804
sent a thrill of horror through the Continent. To the Corsicans it
seemed little more than an autocratic version of the _vendetta
traversale_.[1]
The vendetta was the chief law of Corsican society up to comparatively
recent times; and its effects are still visible in the life of the
home during the whole of my stay in Cleveland. In writing to invite
"me, she mentioned the pleasure it would afford her little ten-year-old"
"daughter to make my acquaintance, and added this somewhat enigmatic"
sentence: “Mignon has asked permission to dedicate her _last_ work to
"you.” I was alarmed at the word _last_, given the age of the author,"
"and felt sorry that the literary faculty had developed quite so early,"
lest the unfettered and irresponsible years of childhood should have
"been sacrificed. I was still more troubled when, upon my arrival,"
I learned that the title of the book which was to be dedicated to
"me was “The Two Army Girls,” and contained the elaborate history of"
"a double courtship. But, as the story was read to me, I was soon"
disarmed. A more innocent recital I never heard--and it was all the
quainter because of certain little grown-up sentences gathered from the
"conversation of elders in unguarded moments, which evidently conveyed"
but slight meaning to the youthful authoress. The final scene between
two of the lovers is so characteristic that I cannot refrain from
"quoting the actual words. Said John: “I love you, and I wish you to be"
"my wife.” “That I will,” said Mary, without any hesitation. “That's all"
"right,” said John. “And now let us _get back to the Golf Links_.”"
"Oh, that modern writers of fiction would “get back to the Golf Links”"
"sooner than they do, realising with this little unconscious philosopher"
that there are some reactions from love-making which show a healthy and
balanced constitution.
Experience with children ought to teach us to avoid stories which
contain too much _allusion_ to matters of which the hearers are
"entirely ignorant; but, judging from the written stories of to-day,"
"supposed to be for children, it is still a matter of difficulty to"
"realise that this form of allusion to “foreign” matters, or making a"
joke the appreciation of which depends solely on a special and “inside”
"knowledge, is always bewildering and fatal to sustained dramatic"
"doctrine, often unconsciously, has survived the introduction of"
"political democracy, and has radically vitiated all national systems of"
education.
The country which has succeeded best in giving information without
"intelligence is the latest addition to modern civilization, Japan."
Elementary education in Japan is said to be admirable from the point of
"view of instruction. But, in addition to instruction, it has another"
"purpose, which is to teach worship of the Mikado—a far stronger creed"
now than before Japan became modernized.[3] Thus the schools have been
used simultaneously to confer knowledge and to promote superstition.
"Since we are not tempted to Mikado-worship, we see clearly what is"
absurd in Japanese teaching. Our own national superstitions strike us as
"natural and sensible, so that we do not take such a true view of them as"
we do of the superstitions of Nippon. But if a travelled Japanese were
to maintain the thesis that our schools teach superstitions just as
"inimical to intelligence as belief in the divinity of the Mikado, I"
suspect that he would be able to make out a very good case.
"For the present I am not in search of remedies, but am only concerned"
with diagnosis. We are faced with the paradoxical fact that education
has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of
thought. This is due primarily to the fact that the State claims a
monopoly; but that is by no means the sole cause.
(2) _Propaganda._—Our system of education turns young people out of the
"schools able to read, but for the most part unable to weigh evidence or"
"to form an independent opinion. They are then assailed, throughout the"
"rest of their lives, by statements designed to make them believe all"
"sorts of absurd propositions, such as that Blank’s pills cure all ills,"
"that Spitzbergen is warm and fertile, and that Germans eat corpses. The"
"art of propaganda, as practised by modern politicians and governments,"
"purged away, leaving to the author complete liberty alike in character"
"and action. When that came, Tragedy returned to the stage, a stranger"
with strange stories to tell. Persia and Ancient Rome sent their tyrants
and their heroines to contest for public favour with home-born knaves
and fools. Nor were the newcomers above borrowing the services of those
"same knaves and fools. The Vice was given a place, low clownish fellows"
"were admitted to relieve the harrowed feelings, and our old"
"acquaintance, Herod, was summoned from the Miracles to lend his aid."
Yet even so--and probably because it was so--Tragedy was ill at ease.
"She had called in low comedy and rant to please the foolish, only to"
"find herself infected and degraded by their company. Moreover, the"
"bustle of incident, the abrupt changes from grave to gay and to grave"
"again, jangled her sad majestic harmonies with shrill interrupting"
discords. It had not been so in Greece. It had not been so even in
"Italy, where Roman Seneca, fearing the least decline to a lower plane of"
"dignity and impressiveness, had disciplined tragedy by an imposition of"
artificial but not unskilful restraints. In place of the strong
"unbroken sweep of a resistless current, which characterized the"
"evolution of an Aeschylean drama, he had insisted on an orderly division"
"of a plot into acts and scenes, as though one should break up the sheer"
plunge of a single waterfall into a well-balanced group of cascades. Yet
"he was wise in his generation, securing by this means a carefully"
"proportioned development which, in the absence of that genius which"
"inspired the Greek dramatists, might otherwise have been lost. Once"
"strong and free in the plays of Aeschylus and his compeers, hampered and"
constantly under guidance but still dignified and noble in the Senecan
"drama, Tragedy now found herself debased and almost caricatured in the"
English Interlude stage. Fortunately the danger was seen in time.
"English writers, face to face with self-conscious tragedy, realized that"
here at least was more than unaided native art could compass. Despairing
"of success if they persisted in the old methods, they fell back"

"fig. 87, laid open to show the ecchymosis on the inner aspect of the"
"Bowel. The two indicating lines lead to the openings, which appear"
"slit-like, and are sunk at the bottom of folds. (St. Thomas's Hospital"

"It may be well to add that, although the figures inserted are all taken"
"from small-intestine wounds, the nature of the wounds of the"
peritoneum-clad part of the large intestine in no way differed from
"them, except in so far as fixity of the bowel exposed it to a more"
extensive wound when the bullet took a parallel course to its long axis.
A more important point in the injuries to the large intestine was the
possibility of an extra-peritoneal wound. I saw several such lesions of
"the colon, every one of which ended fatally. I became still more fully"
convinced of the greater seriousness of extra- to intra-peritoneal
rupture of this portion of the gut than I was when I expressed a similar
opinion in a former paper.[20] It will be seen later that the results of
intra- and extra-peritoneal wounds of the bladder fully confirm this
"view, as all extra-peritoneal injuries died, while many intra-peritoneal"
perforations recovered spontaneously.
_Wounds of the mesentery._--I had little experience of this injury; in
"fact, case 169, on which I operated, was my sole observation. It stands"
"to reason, however, that injuries to the mesentery would be much more"
frequent proportionately to wounds of the gut than is the case in the
"ruptures seen in civil practice, since the whole area of the mesentery"
is equally open to injury. Viewing the extreme danger of hæmorrhage into
"the peritoneal cavity in these injuries, I should be inclined to expect"
that a considerable proportion of those deaths from abdominal wounds
which took place on the field of battle were due to this source.
"touches of emotion or passion, many small yet significant details which"
"nothing but actual observation can reveal, and which throw much light"
"upon the real, inner relation of the native to his institution. So I"
was busy going over my old entries and checking them and putting my
material into shape in a detailed and concrete manner.
"On the third day, as I was sitting and taking notes in the afternoon,"
word ran all round the villages that the Dobuan canoes had been
"sighted. And indeed, as I hastened towards the shore, there could be"
"seen, far away, like small petals floating on the horizon, the sails"
"of the advancing fleet. I jumped at once into a canoe, and was punted"
"along towards the promontory of Kaykuyawa, about a mile to the South of"
"Sinaketa. There, one after the other, the Dobuan canoes were arriving,"
"dropping their sails and undoing the mast as they moored, until the"
"whole fleet, numbering now over eighty canoes, were assembled before"
"me (see Plate XLVIII). From each a few men waded ashore, returning"
with big bunches of leaves. I saw them wash and smear themselves and
"perform the successive stages of native, festive adornment (see Plate"
XLIX). Each article was medicated by some man or another in the canoe
before it was used or put on. The most carefully handled articles
"of ornamentation were the ineffective looking, dried up herbs, taken"
"out of their little receptacles, where they had remained since they"
"had been becharmed in Dobu, and now stuck into the armlets. The whole"
"thing went on quickly, almost feverishly, making more the impression"
"of a piece of technical business being expeditiously performed, than"
of a solemn and elaborate ceremony taking place. But the ceremonial
element was soon to show itself.
"After the preparations were finished, the whole fleet formed itself"
"into a compact body, not quite regular, but with a certain order, about"
"four or five canoes being in a row, and one row behind the other. In"
"this formation they punted along over the Lagoon, too shallow for"
fine-grained limestones even the imprints of jellyfish have been
retained.
The different kinds of molds and casts may be illustrated by means
"of a clam shell and some moist clay, the latter representing the"
sediments in which the remains of animals and plants are entombed.
"Imbedding the shell in the clay and allowing the clay to harden,"
"we have a MOLD OF THE EXTERIOR of the shell, as is seen on cutting"
the clay matrix in two and removing the shell from it. Filling
"this mold with clay of different color, we obtain a CAST OF THE"
"EXTERIOR, which represents accurately the original form and"
"surface markings of the shell. In nature, shells and other relics"
of animals or plants are often removed by being dissolved by
"percolating waters, and the molds are either filled with sediments"
or with minerals deposited from solution.
"Where the fossil is hollow, a CAST OF THE INTERIOR is made in the"
same way. Interior casts of shells reproduce any markings on the
"inside of the valves, and casts of the interior of the skulls of"
ancient vertebrates show the form and size of their brains.
IMPERFECTION OF THE LIFE RECORD. At the present time only the
smallest fraction of the life on earth ever gets entombed in rocks
"now forming. In the forest great fallen tree trunks, as well as"
"dead leaves, decay, and only add a little to the layer of dark"
vegetable mold from which they grew. The bones of land animals
"are, for the most part, left unburied on the surface and are soon"
"destroyed by chemical agencies. Even where, as in the swamps of"
"river, flood plains and in other bogs, there are preserved the"
"remains of plants, and sometimes insects, together with the bones"
"of some animal drowned or mired, in most cases these swamp and bog"
deposits are sooner or later destroyed by the shifting channels of
While native architecture is not stately it is artistic in that it
harmonizes with its natural surroundings and is eminently adapted to the
needs of the people who inhabit the huts.]
"It is beyond doubt to the ease with which life can be sustained, and the"
torpidity of the native imagination which depicts no joys to spur one on
to effort that the unwillingness of the native to do systematic work is
due. And from this difficulty in getting labor follows the fact that
not one quarter of the natural resources of Panama are developed.
Whether the labor problem will be solved by the distribution throughout
the republic of the Caribbean blacks who have worked so well on the Zone
is yet to be seen. It may be possible that because of this the fertile
"lands of Panama, or the savannas so admirably fitted for grazing, can"
only be utilized by great corporations who will do things on so great a
scale as to justify the importation of labor. Today the man who should
take up a large tract of land in the Chiriqui country with a view to
tilling it would be risking disaster because of the uncertainty of the
labor supply.
[Illustration: CONSTRUCTION OF ROOF OF A NATIVE HOUSE
The photograph is taken looking directly upward from the ground floor]
Another obstacle in the way of foreign settlement of Panama has been the
uncertainty of land titles. Early surveyors seem to have been in the
habit of noting as the identification marks of their lines such volatile
"objects as a blackbird in a tree, or such perishable ones as an ant hill"
or a decaying stump. Facilities for recording titles also have been ill
arranged. One of the first tasks of the new Republic was to take up this
matter and it has been reduced to fairly systematic form. The Republic
is offering for sale great quantities of public lands long held as
performed by Sts. Cosmo and Damian upon a man who was praying in the
"church dedicated to them, and who had a diseased leg amputated without"
"pain by the good saints while he slept; and not only so, but had a"
"sound leg, which they had taken from the body of a man just buried,"
substituted for the diseased one. Nor can I dwell on the miraculous
blindness with which the guard sent to seize Pope St. Martin I. was
stricken the moment he caught sight of the pontiff in St. Maria
"Maggiore, or the miraculous tears shed by an image of the Virgin"
attached to a neighboring wall when she saw a cruel murder committed in
"the street below, or the madonnas and crucifixes that spoke to saints"
"on various occasions. One of these, however, is too significant to be"
omitted altogether. There is in the Church of St. Agostino a sculptured
"image of the Madonna and child. ""It is not long since the report was"
spread that one day a poor woman called upon this image of the Madonna
"for help; it began to speak, and replied, 'If I had only something,"
"then I could help thee, but I myself am so poor!' This story was"
"circulated, and very soon throngs of credulous people hastened hither"
"to kiss the foot of the Madonna, _and to present her with all kinds of"
"gifts_."" (Italics mine.)"
"[Sidenote: How the Papal Treasury was Filled, and how it was Emptied.]"
The evil methods employed at various times to replenish the papal
"treasury are known to all readers of history. The best known, perhaps,"
"is the shameless traffic in indulgences by Tetzel, which helped to"
precipitate the Reformation. Hare closes his account of the execution
of Beatrice Cenci for complicity in the murder of her father with the
"statement that ""sympathy will always follow one who sinned under the"
"most terrible of provocations, and whose cruel death was due to the"
avarice of Clement VIII. for the riches which the church acquired by
"the confiscation of the Cenci property,"" and cites the petition of"
"Gaspare Guizza (1601), in which he claims a reward from the Pope for"
"paddling, towards the beach of Sinaketa. When they were within about"
"ten minutes of the shore, all the conch shells began to be sounded,"
and the murmur of recited magic rose from the canoes. I could not come
"sufficiently near the canoes, for reason of etiquette, to be able to"
"see the exact arrangement of the reciters, but I was told that it was"
the same as that observed by the Trobrianders on their approach to
"Dobu, described in Chapter XIII. The general effect was powerful, when"
this wonderfully painted and fully decorated fleet was gliding swiftly
"good citizens, as well as the undesirable class, would either attend the"
hearings or familiarize themselves with the quarterly reports. Thus a
general steal would be impossible. A single Commissioner cannot make all
"of his business public, and much that he does never reaches the light of"
"publicity. In fact, I believe that because the Commissioner cannot take"
"the public into his confidence, abuses are bound to occur. Often it"
"remains for the Indian Rights Association, or other organizations, to"
appeal to the public and do that which the Indian Office should
establish without outside influence. There would be far less incentive
"to dishonesty, were covetous white men compelled to deal with a"
Commission instead of an individual. The publication of the Board’s
hearings and findings would have a deterrent effect on certain men who
otherwise appeal to Senators or Congressmen.
I have often contrasted the work of Dr. W. T. Grenfell in Labrador with
that of organizations laboring among our Indians. We are not responsible
"for the condition of the fishermen in Labrador, and they are numerically"
but a fraction as compared with our total Indian population. Yet Dr.
"Grenfell, through his lectures and publications has aroused such an"
interest in this country that he can collect for his Labrador work a sum
far greater than that expended in support of six Indian missions. People
are interested in him and his work because of the appeal he makes. The
"Labrador fishermen suffer no wrongs compared with our Indians, and their"
condition is far better than that of the average aborigine. Similar
"advantages whereof others are incapable.""[812] And Sir Josiah Child, of"
"the same generation, declared similarly against transcendentalism in"
"such matters. ""If any,"" he roundly declares, ""shall tell me it is the"
"nature of those people to be thrifty, I answer, _all men by nature are"
"alike_; it is only laws, custom, and education that differ men; their"
"nature and disposition, and the disposition of all people in the world,"
"proceed from their laws.""[813] For ""laws"" read ""circumstances and"
"institutions,"" adding reservations as to climate and temperament and"
"variation of _individual_ capacity and bias, and the proposition is the"
essence of all sociology. Economic lessons which Petty and Child could
not master have since been learned; but their higher wisdom has hardly
yet been assimilated.
The sufficient proof that Holland had no abnormal enlightenment even in
"commerce was that, like her rivals, she continued to maintain the system"
"of monopoly companies. Her ""empire"" in the East, to which was falsely"
"ascribed so much of her wealth, in reality stood for very little sound"
"commerce. The East India Company being conducted on high monopoly lines,"
the profits were made rather through the smallness than the greatness of
"the trade done. Thus, while the Company paid enormous dividends,[814]"
"the imports of spice were kept at a minimum, in order to maintain the"
"price, large quantities being actually destroyed for the purpose. For a"
time they contrived to raise pepper to double the old Portuguese
price.[815] Such methods brought it about that when the republic had in
"all 10,000 sail, the East India trade employed only ten or twelve"
ships.[816] All the while the small class of capitalists who owned the
shares were able to satisfy the people that the merely monetary and
factitious riches thus secured to the Company's shareholders was a form
of public wealth.[817]
"It is a complete error to say, as did Professor Seeley (_Expansion"
"of England_, p. 112), that Holland ""made her fortune in the world"""
"philosophic system which acted as her handmaid, and was only tolerated"
"as such, was naturally affected in like manner by the change; and to"
"her credit be it said, that instead of with averted eyes looking"
"elsewhere, as might easily have been done, she determined to face the"
"worst, and wisely asked the question whether in her department too she"
had not something she could learn from a sister country across the sea.
Hence a great change was brought about in the mental attitude of
Scotland; but we anticipate.
"Ferrier, after leaving Heidelberg, paid a short visit to Leipzig, and"
then for a few weeks took up his abode at Berlin. From Leipzig he
writes to Miss Wilson again: 'How do you like an _epistola_ dated from
"this great emporium of taste and letters, this culminating point of"
"Germanism, where waggons jostle philosophy, and tobacco-impregnated air"
"is articulated into divinest music? It is fair-time, and I did not"
"arrive, as one usually does, a day _behind_ it, but on the very day it"
"commenced. It will last, I believe, some weeks, and during that time"
"all business is done on the open streets, which are lined on each side"
"with large wooden booths, and are swarming with men and merchandise of"
every description and from every quarter of the world. It very much
"resembles a _Ladies' Sale_ in the Assembly Rooms (what I never saw),"
"only the ladies here are frequently Jews with fierce beards, and have"
always a pipe in their mouths when not eating or drinking. As you walk
along you will find the order of the day to be somewhat as follows. You
"first come to pipes, then shawls, then nails, then pipes, pipes again,"
"pipes, gingerbread, dolls, then pipes, bridles, spurs, pipes, books,"
"warming-pans, pipes, china, writing-desks, pipes again, pipes, pipes,"
"pipes, nothing but pipes--the very pen will write nothing but pipes."
"Pipes, you see, decidedly carry it. I wonder they don't erect public"

away--a city at a time. Private families might take it in as we do
gas!'
especially abundant in the Keweenawan lavas. After the Keweenawan
"was uplifted to form land, percolating waters leached out much of"
the copper diffused in the lava sheets and deposited it within
"steam blebs as amygdules of native copper, in cracks and fissures,"
"and especially as a cement, or matrix, in the interbedded gravels"
which formed the chief aquifers of the region. The famous Calumet
and Hecla mine follows down the dip of the strata to the depth of
nearly a mile and works such an ancient conglomerate whose matrix
is pure copper.
THE APPEARANCE OF LIFE. Sometime during the dim ages preceding the
"Cambrian, whether in the Archean or in the Algonkian we know not,"
occurred one of the most important events in the history of the
earth. Life appeared for the first time upon the planet. Geology
has no evidence whatever to offer as to whence or how life came.
All analogies lead us to believe that its appearance must have
"been sudden. Its earliest forms are unknown, but analogy suggests"
"that as every living creature has developed from a single cell, so"
the earliest organisms upon the globe--the germs from which all
"later life is supposed to have been evolved--were tiny,"
"unicellular masses of protoplasm, resembling the amoeba of to-day"
in the simplicity of their structure.
Such lowly forms were destitute of any hard parts and could leave
no evidence of their existence in the record of the rocks. And of
their supposed descendants we find so few traces in the pre-
Cambrian strata that the first steps in organic evolution must be
supplied from such analogies in embryology as the following. The
"fertilized ovum, the cell with which each animal begins its life,"
"grows and multiplies by cell division, and develops into a hollow"
globe of cells called the BLASTOSPHERE. This stage is succeeded by
"the stage of the GASTRULA,--an ovoid or cup-shaped body with a"
"During his meteoric career as a pirate, the name of Blackbeard was one"
that created terror up and down the coast of America from Newfoundland to
"Trinidad. This was not only due to the number of ships Teach took, but in"
"no small measure to his alarming appearance. Teach was a tall, powerful"
"man, with a fierce expression, which was increased by a long, black beard"
which grew from below his eyes and hung down to a great length. This he
"plaited into many tails, each one tied with a coloured ribbon and turned"
"back over his ears. When going into action, Teach wore a sling on his"
"shoulders with three pairs of pistols, and struck lighted matches under"
the brim of his hat. These so added to his fearful appearance as to strike
"terror into all beholders. Teach had a peculiar sense of humour, and one"
that could at times cause much uneasiness amongst his friends. Thus we are
"told that one day on the deck of his ship, being at the time a little"
"flushed with wine, Blackbeard addressed his crew, saying: ""Come let us"
"make a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it,"" whereupon Teach,"
"with several others, descended to the hold, shut themselves in, and then"
"set fire to several pots of brimstone. For a while they stood it, choking"
"and gasping, but at length had to escape to save themselves from being"
"asphyxiated, but the last to give up was the captain, who was wont to"
boast afterwards that he had outlasted all the rest.
"Then there was that little affair in the cabin, when Teach blew out the"
"candle and in the dark fired his pistols under the table, severely"
"wounding one of his guests in the knee, for no other reason, as he"
"explained to them afterwards, than ""if he did not shoot one or two of them"
"now and then they'd forget who he was."""
"Teach kept a log or journal, which unfortunately is lost, but the entries"
"for two days have been preserved, and are worth giving, and seem to smack"
"of Robert Louis Stevenson in ""Treasure Island."" The entries, written in"
"Teach's handwriting, run as follows:"
Indefinite belief in the existence of “something not ourselves which
"makes for righteousness” has no motive force, and though men may rub"
"on in some fashion or other by following ancient custom, and the law"
"of use and wont, this can only be done in quiet times. And ours are"
"not quiet times; indeed, the air is thick with principles which are"
forcing themselves into expression. The principles of Nationality or
"Cosmopolitanism, the comity of nations and the limits of destruction,"
"international trades unionism, and the laws of marriage are recurring"
items upon the programme of every social science congress. All these
"dark questions are forced upon the attentions of men, and never was"
there greater need of some synthetic philosophy which may help us in
their exploration. Are we going to put Christianity aside and rule out
theology from our calculations?
I may quote the testimony of the late Sir Leslie Stephen here. Every
one knows that he held no brief to defend orthodoxy--
"“To proclaim unsectarian Christianity is, in circuitous"
"language, to proclaim that Christianity is dead. The love of"
"Christ, as representing the ideal perfection of human nature,"
"may indeed be still a powerful motive, and powerful whatever"
the view which we take of Christ’s character. The advocates of
the doctrine in its more intellectual form represent this
passion as the true essence of Christianity. They assert with
obvious sincerity of conviction that it is the leverage by
"which alone the world can be moved. But, as they would"
"themselves admit, this conception would be preposterous if,"
"with Strauss, we regarded Christ as a mere human being. Our"
"regard for Him might differ in degree, but would not differ in"
"kind, from our regard for Socrates or for Pascal. It would be"
impossible to consider it as an overmastering and all-powerful
influence. The old dilemma would be inevitable; he that loves
"experienced, except such as have been already dealt with. The only class"
of case which frequently gave rise to difficulty was hæmothorax. Here
two points especially needed consideration. (1) _The source of the
"hæmorrhage as parietal or visceral._ As has been already foreshadowed,"
this was mainly to be decided by the amount and persistence of the
"hæmoptysis, but naturally free hæmoptysis did not negative concurrent"
parietal bleeding. Then the actual source of the bleeding other than
from the lung had to be considered; in the great majority of cases the
"intercostal vessels were responsible, and attention to the course of the"
tracks often allowed this to be definitely decided upon.
"A case included in the chapter on Injuries to the Blood Vessels (No. 5,"
p. 127) is of great interest in this particular; in that instance
"feebleness of the radial pulse, together with the position of the wound,"
"was a valuable indication of injury to the subclavian artery, but"
"weakened somewhat by the fact of retention of the bullet, and hence"
"uncertainty as to the exact course that it had taken, and as to whether"
the bullet itself was not responsible for pressure on the vessel. Such
"indications, however, should make one very chary of interference with a"
"hæmothorax, even with extremely urgent symptoms, in the light of our"
present knowledge of the nature of the lesions to the great vessels
"produced by small-calibre bullets, and their tendency to be incomplete."
(2) _The imminence of suppuration or its actual occurrence._--In most
"cases it sufficed to preserve an expectant attitude, and in the"
"persistence or increase of symptoms, to have recourse to an exploratory"
puncture as the best means of solution of the difficulty.
_Prognosis._--The prognosis both as to life and as to subsequent
ill-effects was remarkably good; in many cases of uncomplicated injury
to the lung the patients rejoined their regiments at the end of a month
or six weeks. In the more serious cases complicated by the collection of
"turbid fluid was effused, was found. In others a rapid suppurative"
"process, accompanied by the effusion of large quantities of plastic"
"lymph, was met with. My experience suggested that the latter condition"
"was the result of free infection from multiple wounds of the gut, the"
former the accompaniment of single wounds. Hence I should ascribe the
difference mainly to the extent of the primary infection.
This is perhaps a suitable place to further discuss the explanation of
the escape of a considerable number of the patients who received wounds
"of the abdomen, possibly implicating the bowel. Although this was not, I"
"think, so common an occurrence as has been sometimes assumed, yet many"
examples were met with. Several reasons have been advanced.
(1) Great importance has been given to the fact that many of the men
"were wounded while in a state of hunger, no food having been taken for"
twelve or more hours before the reception of the injury. In view of the
"well-proved fact in these, as in other intestinal injuries, that free"
"intestinal escape does not occur, and that it is usually a mere question"
"of infection, this explanation, in my opinion, is of small importance."
It might with far more justice be pointed out that many of these wounded
men were for them in the happy position of not having friends freely
"dosing them with brandy and water after the reception of the injury, and"
this was possibly an element of some importance.
"Some of the men did, however, drink freely, and in one case which"
terminated fatally a comrade gave a man wounded through the belly an
immediate dose of Beecham's pills.
(2) Mr. Treves has suggested that the effect of the severe trauma on the
muscular coat of the bowel is to cause a cessation of peristaltic
"movement. This, as in the case of 'local shock' elsewhere, may no doubt"
"be of importance, and to it should be added the simultaneous cessation"
not reject them offhand and altogether: what revolts him is that they
are so often performed without understanding and right feeling. But to
"his mind, highly susceptible to the foolish and ridiculous things, and"
"with a delicate need of high decorum and inward dignity, all that sphere"
"of ceremony and tradition displays itself as a useless, nay, a hurtful"
"scene of human stupidity and selfishness. And, intellectualist as he is,"
"with his contempt for ignorance, he seems unaware that those religious"
"observances, after all, may contain valuable sentiments of unexpressed"
and unformulated piety.
"Through his treatises, his letters, his _Colloquies_ especially, there"
always passes--as if one was looking at a gallery of Brueghel's
pictures--a procession of ignorant and covetous monks who by their
sanctimony and humbug impose upon the trustful multitude and fare
sumptuously themselves. As a fixed motif (such motifs are numerous with
Erasmus) there always recurs his gibe about the superstition that a
person was saved by dying in the gown of a Franciscan or a Dominican.
"Fasting, prescribed prayers, the observance of holy days, should not be"
"altogether neglected, but they become displeasing to God when we repose"
"our trust in them and forget charity. The same holds good of confession,"
"indulgence, all sorts of blessings. Pilgrimages are worthless. The"
veneration of the Saints and of their relics is full of superstition and
foolishness. The people think they will be preserved from disasters
during the day if only they have looked at the painted image of Saint
Christopher in the morning. 'We kiss the shoes of the saints and their
"dirty handkerchiefs and we leave their books, their most holy and"
"efficacious relics, neglected.'"
"Erasmus's dislike of what seemed antiquated and worn out in his days,"
went farther still. It comprised the whole intellectual scheme of
medieval theology and philosophy. In the syllogistic system he found
"marriage-journey, Eros is not merely the guide of the steeds, but aids"
"the bridegroom in carrying off Kore, so that in this case the struggle"
with death takes purely the form of a struggle with love. At the same
"time the mother is driving along with her chariot, thereby signifying"
"the renewal of life, which is yet more clearly betokened in the"
ploughman and the sower at her side.
‘In a yet gentler spirit we see the same journey conceived in a
vase-painting from lower Italy. Here there is a look of gentleness
"on Hades’ face; the bride accompanies him gladly, and even takes an"
"affectionate farewell of her mother, who appears to acquiesce in her"
"departure. In this case too Eros is flying above the horses, and is"
"turned towards the lovers, while in front of him there flies a dove,"
the bird sacred to the goddess of love. Hecate with torches guides the
steeds; near at hand waits Hermes to escort the procession; and above
"the whole scene the stars are shining, as if to indicate the new life"
in the region of death.
"‘In another form, exalted to a yet higher holiness, the same marriage"
is repeated in the sphere of Dionysus-worship. Thus on a cameo in the
"Vatican, Dionysus is represented driving with his bride, Ariadne, in"
a brightly-decked triumphal car. Holy rapture is manifested on the
"features of both, and on top of the chariot stands a Cupid directing"
"it. Dionysus is arrayed in the doe-skin, and holds in his left hand"
"a _thyrsus_, in his right a goblet; Ariadne is carrying ears of corn"
"and poppy-heads, and has her hair wreathed with vine-leaves. The car"
"is drawn by Centaurs of both sexes, with torches, drinking-horns,"
and musical instruments. The idea which underlies this scene is the
reproduction of Life out of Death; Hades has issued forth again for
"a new marriage-bond with Kore in the realm of light, appearing now"
"rejuvenated in the form of Dionysus, just as his bride assumes the form"
"of Ariadne, and because the power of death is broken behind him, his"
fear of alarming the child. This is quite indefensible. In doing this
we are tampering with folk-lore and confusing stages of development.
"Now, I know that there are individual children that, at a tender"
"age, might be alarmed at such a story, for instance, as Little Red"
"Riding-Hood; in which case, it is better to sacrifice the “wonder"
stage” and present the story later on.
I live in dread of finding one day a bowdlerized form of “Bluebeard”
"(prepared for a junior standard), in which, to produce a satisfactory"
"finale, all the wives come to life again, and “live happily for ever"
after” with Bluebeard and each other!
And from this point it seems an easy transition to the subject of
legends of different kinds. Some of the old country legends in
"connection with flowers are very charming for children, and as long as"
"we do not tread on the sacred ground of the Nature Students, we may"
"indulge in a moderate use of such stories, of which a few will be found"
in the Story Lists.
With regard to the introduction of legends connected with saints into
"the school curriculum, my chief plea is the element of the unusual"
"which they contain, and an appeal to a sense of mysticism and wonder"
which is a wise antidote to the prosaic and commercial tendencies of
to-day. Though many of the actions of the saints may be the result of
"a morbid strain of self-sacrifice, at least none of them were engaged"
in the sole occupation of becoming rich: their ideals were often lofty
"and unselfish; their courage high, and their deeds noble. We must be"
"careful, in the choice of our legends, to show up the virile qualities"
"rather than to dwell on the elements of horror in details of martyrdom,"
"or on the too-constantly recurring miracles, lest we should defeat our"
own ends. For the children might think lightly of the dangers to which
restored and public meetings to oppose the Government were rigorously
"suppressed, trade and manufactures were arising: Scotland was not"
"really dead, as she appeared. A new life was dawning: reform was in the"
"air, and in due time made its presence felt. But the memory of these"
"times of political oppression, when the franchise was the privilege of"
"the few, and of the few who were entirely out of sympathy with the most"
"part of their countrymen or their country's wants, remained with the"
people just as did the 'Killing-time' of Covenanting days two centuries
"before. Time heals the wounds of a country as of an individual, but the"
"operation is slow, and it is doubtful whether either period of history"
"will ever be forgotten. At anyrate, if they are so as this century"
"closes, they were not in the Scotland known to Ferrier; they were still"
a very present memory and one whose influence was keenly felt.
And along with this political struggle yet another struggle was taking
"place, no less real though not so evident. The religion of the country"
had been as dead as was the politics in the century that was gone--dead
"in the sleep of Moderatism and indifferentism. But it, too, had"
"awakened; the evangelical school arose, liberty of church government"
"was claimed, a liberty which, when denied it, rent the Established"
Church in twain.
In our country it has been characteristic that great movements have
"usually begun with those most in touch with its inmost life, the"
so-called lower orders of its citizens. The nobles and the kings have
rather followed than taken the lead. In the awakening of the present
"century this at anyrate was the case. 'Society,' so called, remained"
conservative in its view for long after the people had determined to
"advance. Scott, it must be remembered, was a retrogressive influence."
The romanticism of his novels lent a charm to days gone by which might
or might not be deserved; but they also encouraged their readers to
"imagine a revival of those days of chivalry as a possibility even now,"
"value--all the greater because a child is familiar with the subject,"
and the stories gain fresh significance from the spoken or winged word
as compared with the mere reading. Whether we should keep to the actual
"text is a matter of individual experience. Professor R. G. Moulton,"
whose interpretations of the Bible Stories are so well known both in
"England and the States, does not always confine himself to the actual"
"text, but draws the dramatic elements together, rejecting what seems to"
"him to break the narrative, but introducing the actual language where"
it is the most effective. Those who have heard him will realise the
success of his method.
"There is one Bible story which can be told with scarcely any deviation,"
"and that is the story of Nebuchadnezzar and the Golden Image. Thus, I"
"think it wise, if the children are to succeed in partially visualizing"
"the story, that they should have some idea of the dimensions of the"
Golden Image as it would stand out in a vast plain. It might be well
to compare those dimensions with some building with which the child is
"familiar. In London the matter is easy, as the height will compare,"
"roughly speaking, with that of Westminster Abbey. The only change in"
the text I should adopt is to avoid the constant enumeration of the
"list of rulers and the musical instruments. In doing this, I am aware"
"that I am sacrificing something of beauty in the rhythm,--on the other"
"hand, for narrative purpose, the interest is not broken. The first time"
"the announcement is made, that is, by the Herald, it should be in a"
"perfectly loud, clear and toneless voice, such as you would naturally"
use when shouting through a trumpet to a vast concourse of people
scattered over a wide plain; reserving all the dramatic tone of voice
for the passage where Nebuchadnezzar is making the announcement to the
three men by themselves. I can remember Professor Moulton saying that
all the dramatic interest of the story is summed up in the words “But
"if Not....” This suggestion is a very helpful one, for it enables us to"
"work up gradually to this point, and then, as it were, _unwind_, until"
tablet links up the popular conception of death as a wedding with the
Platonic conception of the deification of the soul. ‘I was admitted to
"the embrace of Despoina, Queen of the underworld’: ‘Happy and Blessed"
"One, thou shalt be God instead of mortal.’"
"But if Plato, even in his conception of a purely spiritual life"
"hereafter, owed something to the popular religion, he drew upon it"
far more freely in his conception of Love. In the _Symposium_ one
speech after another culminates in the assertion of that belief which
"found its highest expression in the mysteries. ‘So then I say,’ says"
"Phaedrus, ‘that Love is the most venerable of the gods, the most"
"worthy of honour, the most powerful to grant virtue and blessedness"
unto mankind both in life and after death[1528].’ And in the same tone
too Eryximachus: ‘He it is that wields the mightiest power and is
the source for us of all blessedness and of our power to have loving
fellowship both with one another and with the gods that are stronger
"than we[1529].’ And finally Aristophanes: It is Love, ‘who in this"
"present life gives us most joys by drawing like unto like, and for our"
"hereafter displays hopes most high, if we for our part display piety"
"towards the gods, that he will restore us to our erstwhile nature and"
will heal us and will make us happy and blessed[1530].’
This is not Platonic philosophy but popular religion. Phrase after
phrase reveals the origin of this conception of Love. The hopes most
high were the hopes held forth by the mysteries; the blessedness and
the loving fellowship with gods were the fulfilment of those hopes.
In such language did men ever hint at the joys to which their mystic
sacraments gave access. And Plato here ventures yet further. The author
"of those high hopes, the founder of that blessedness, he proclaims, is"
none other than Love--Love that appealed not to the soul only of the
"initiated, but to the whole man, both soul and body--Love that meant"
not only the yearning after wisdom and holiness and spiritual equality
of the capital which had seldom or never been equalled in the history of
the Colony. He had caused them to be called together in order to raise
"their enthusiasm, and to elicit from them a visible, unmistakable pledge"
"of support. But, when he stood before them, bareheaded, in vain"
"beckoning for silence, their cries and cheers told him that his task was"
"rather to moderate than to stir up, and the first part of his speech was"
a somewhat laboured proof of the consistency of gatherings of that
nature with the proper independence of representative assemblies. The
"people heard him through this argument in respectful silence, clapping"
"their hands when, at the end of it, he paused before he passed to the"
"second part of his speech. At the first sign of attack, at the first"
quietly drawn contrast between what the seceders had promised and what
"they were doing, his audience was a changed one. Fierce murmurs of"
"assent and groans became audible now, and when Medland, caught by the"
"contagion that spread to him from his listeners, gave rein to his"
"feelings, and launched into a passionate declaration that, to his mind,"
the liberty claimed for members did not mean liberty to betray those
"who had trusted them, the murmurs and groans rose into one tumult of"
"savage applause, and men raised both hands over their heads and shook"
"them, as though they would have clenched every word that fell from him"
with a blow of the fist.
"Daisy Medland sat just behind her father, exulting in his triumph, and,"
"at every happy stroke, glancing at Norburn, and by sharing her joy with"
"him doubling his. When the Premier had finished, and the last resolution"
"had been carried, she ran to him, crying, ""Splendid! I never heard you"
"so good. Wasn't he splendid?"" and looking so completely joyful that"
Medland was sure she must quite have forgotten Dick Derosne. She took
"his arm, and they made their way together to a carriage which was in"
"waiting. An escort of police surrounded it, to save the Premier from his"
"friends, and he, with Daisy, Norburn, and Mr. Floyd, the Treasurer, got"
in without disturbance. The coachman drove off rapidly down the main
CHAPTER V
"THUS it came to pass that, for the sake of Stellamaris, Risca remained"
in London and fought with beasts in Fenton Square. Sometimes he got the
"better of the beasts, and sometimes the beasts got the better of him. On"
the former occasions he celebrated the victory by doing an extra turn of
work; on the latter he sat idly growling at defeat.
"At this period of his career he was assistant-editor of a weekly review,"
"in charge of the book-column of an evening newspaper, the contributor of"
"a signed weekly article on general subjects to the “Daily Herald,” and"
of a weekly London letter to an American syndicate. From this it will
be seen that for a man not yet thirty he had achieved a position in
journalism envied by many who had grown gray-headed in the game. But as
Risca had written three or four novels which had all been rejected by
"all the publishers in London, he chose to regard himself as a man foiled"
in his ambitions. He saw himself doomed to failure. For him was the
eternal toil of ploughing the sand; the Garden of Delight cultivated by
"the happy Blest--such as Fawcus of the club, who boasted of making over"
"a thousand pounds for every novel he wrote, and of being able to take"
as much holiday as he chose--had its gilded gates closed against him
forever. That the man of nine-and-twenty should grow embittered because
he was not accepted by the world as a brilliant novelist is a matter for
the derision of the middle-aged and for the pitying smile of the hoary;
"but it is a matter of woeful concern to twenty-nine, especially if"
twenty-nine be a young man of a saturnine temperament whom fate has
driven to take himself seriously. In Risca's life there were misfortunes
the reality of the pain of which was independent of age; others which
"were relative, as inseparable from youth as the tears for a bumped head"
are inseparable from childhood. Yet to the man they were all equally
"absolute. It is only in after-years, when one looks back down the vista,"
"Easter lamb, and while it is still a-cooking experience the inevitable"
"effects of plentiful wine on an empty stomach. Again, just as the rites"
"of Eleusis were nocturnal, so the chief services of Holy Week are those"
of the Friday night and the Saturday night; and it may be that the
torch-light processions which close the services on those two nights
are related to the δᾳδουχία of Eleusis. But these are minor details;
it is in the actual services of Good Friday and Easter that the most
"striking resemblance to the Eleusinian mysteries is found, and the"
spirit in which the worshippers approach may still be the same now as
then. Let me briefly describe the festival as I saw it in the island
"of Santorini, or, to give it the old name which has revived in modern"
"times, Thera."
The Lenten fast was drawing to a close when I arrived. For the first
"week it is strictly observed, meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, and"
"even olive-oil being prohibited, so that the ordinary diet is reduced"
"to bread and water, to which is sometimes added a nauseous soup made"
from dried cuttle-fish or octopus; for these along with shellfish
"are not reckoned to be animal food, as being bloodless. During the"
next four weeks some relaxation is allowed; but no one with any
"pretensions to piety would even then partake of fish, meat, or eggs;"
"the last-mentioned are stored up until Easter and then, being dyed"
"red, are either eaten or--more wisely--offered to visitors. Then comes"
"‘the Great Week’ (ἡ μεγάλη ἑβδομάδα), and with it the same strict"
regulations come into force as during the first week of Lent. It was
not hard to perceive that for most of the villagers the fast had been
a real and painful abstinence. Work had almost ceased; for there was
little energy left. Leisure was not enjoyed; for there was little
"spirit even for chatting. Everywhere white, sharp-featured faces told"
of real hunger; and the silence was most often broken by an outburst
of irritability. In a few days time I could understand it; for I too
perforce fasted; and I must own that a daily diet of dry bread for
internal sensation it is perhaps because he has another person inside
him. The case has even been recorded of a man who attributed any feeling
"he experienced, even the most normal sensations of hunger and thirst, to"
the people around him. It is exactly the same process as goes on in our
"dreams. The sane man, the normal waking man, may experience all these"
"strange sensations, but he recognises that they are the spontaneous"
outcome of his own organisation.
"We may, however, advance a step beyond this position. This"
"self-objectivation, this dramatisation of our experiences, is not"
confined to sleep and to pathological conditions which resemble sleep.
It is natural and primitive in a far wider sense. The infant will gaze
"inquisitively at its own feet, watch their movements, play with them,"
'punish' them; consciousness has not absorbed them as part of the
self.[174] The infant really acts and feels towards the remote parts of
his own body as the adult acts and feels in dreaming. We are reminded of
the generalisation of Giessler that dream consciousness corresponds to
"the normal psychic state in childhood, while sleeping subconsciousness"
corresponds to the embryonic psychic state; so that the dream state
represents the renascence of the ego disentangling itself from the
impersonal sensations and indistinct images of the embryonic stage of
life. That sleeping consciousness is the primitive embryonic consciousness
"is, indeed, indicated, it has often seemed to me, by the fact that in"
many animals the embryonic position is the position of rest and sleep.
Ducklings and chicks in the shell have their heads beneath their wing. The
"dog lies with his feet together, head flexed, and hind-quarters drawn up."
"Man, alike in the womb and asleep, tends to be curled up, with the flexors"
predominating over the extensors.
The savage has gone beyond the infant in ability to assimilate the
"impressions of his own limbs, but on the psychic side he still"
"constantly tends to objectify his own feelings and ideas, re-creating"
"regard it as a new, strange teaching, and know that we are but seeing"
"again with clearer eyes what a half-knowledge blinded us to, then the"
world will be bright and beautiful to us as it was long ago.
"But now all is dark. There are no dryads in our trees, nor nymphs among"
the reeds that fringe the river; even our peaks hold for us no guardian
"spirit, that may take the reckless trespasser and bind him in a rock for"
"ever. And because we have lost our belief in fairies, because we do not"
"now think that there are goblins in our caves, because there is no"
"spirit in the winds nor voice in the thunder, we have come to think that"
"the trees and the rocks, the flowers and the storm, are all dead things."
"They are made up, we say, of materials that we know, they are governed"
"by laws that we have discovered, and there is no life anywhere in"
Nature.
And yet this cannot be true. Far truer is it to believe in fairies and
in spirits than in nothing at all; for surely there is life all about
"us. Who that has lived out alone in the forest, that has lain upon the"
hillside and seen the mountains clothe themselves in lustrous shadows
"shot with crimson when the day dies, who that has heard the sigh come up"
"out of the ravines where the little breezes move, that has watched the"
"trees sway their leaves to and fro, beckoning to each other with wayward"
"amorous gestures, but has known that these are not dead things?"
Watch the stream coming down the hill with a flash and a laugh in the
"sunlight, look into the dark brown pools in the deep shadows beneath"
"the rocks, or voyage a whole night upon the breast of the great river,"
"drifting past ghostly monasteries and silent villages, and then say if"
"there be no life in the waters, if they, too, are dead things. There is"
"no consolation like the consolation of Nature, no sympathy like the"
sympathy of the hills and streams; and sympathy comes from life. There
is no sympathy with the dead.
precaution such as the dose of hemlock was taken in the interests of
morality.
But the mere fact that a scene of rape should form any part of a
"religious rite, was to the Christians a stumbling-block. This was their"
"insurmountable objection to the mysteries, and they were only too prone"
"to exaggerate a ceremony, which with reverent and delicate treatment"
"need have been in no way morally deleterious, into a sensual and"
"noxious orgy. The story, how Demeter’s beautiful and innocent daughter"
was suddenly carried off from the meadow where she was gathering
"flowers into the depths of the dark under-world, spoke to them only"
of the violence and lust of her ravisher Aïdoneus. But the legend
"might bear another complexion. Kore, as representative of mankind or"
"at least of the initiated among mankind, suffers what seems the most"
"cruel lot, a sudden departure from this life in the midst of youth and"
"beauty and spring-time; and Demeter searches for her awhile in vain,"
and mourns for her as men mourn their dead. Yet afterward it is found
"that there is no cruelty in Kore’s lot, for she is the honoured bride"
of the king of that world to which she was borne away; and Demeter is
"comforted, for her child is not dead nor lost to her, but is allowed"
to return in living form to visit her. What then must have been the
‘happier hopes’ held out to those who had looked on the great drama
of Eleusis? What was meant by that prospect of being ‘god-beloved
and sharing the life of gods’? How came it that the assembly of the
initiated believed their salvation to lie in the union of Hades and
"Persephone, represented in the persons of hierophant and priestess, in"
the subterranean nuptial-chamber? What was the bearing of the legend
dramatically enacted upon these hopes and prospects and beliefs? Surely
"it taught that not only was there physical life beyond death, but a"
life of wedded happiness with the gods.
And the same doctrine seems to be the _motif_ of many other popular
the Scriptures?” “Did Jesus Christ go up into heaven in the sight of
the apostles till a cloud received Him?” “Did Mary’s Son come to her
as other babies come?” “Was Joseph Jesus Christ’s real father?” Our
"members of Parliament who have no leisure to know their own children,"
who keep them in the nursery till it is time for them to go to the
"Preparatory School, who leave their training to the governess and the"
"head-master, may talk about “the cruelty of the religious differences"
which hinder the establishment of an efficient system of education for
the children of the State.” But the men and the mothers who live with
"their children and talk to them about their lessons, know that a child"
will insist upon an answer to its questions. A father of a family in
"the artisan and labouring classes, if he be at all intelligent, loses"
all respect for ministers of the Gospel who pretend that there is no
"difficulty about the simple Gospel story, and losing his self-respect"
"for the men who have appointed themselves his teachers, he is tempted"
to throw all theology aside. And if he ventures on this despairing
expedient he finds himself in mental confusion again over ethics
"instead of theology, and there arises a prospect of anarchy and"
"disorder. Capital is timid, so enterprise is checked. Poverty"
"increases and riot follows, and it all ends, not now-a-days in the"
"Napoleonic “whiff of grape-shot,” but in the rattle of the maxim in"
the streets and the desolation of a thousand homes.
The experience of all civilization is that you cannot separate
morality from religion. When the Romans lost their faith in the old
"gods and became “undenominational,” civic virtue decayed. When the"
genius of the Empire was set up for a universal Deity and men were
bidden as good citizens to burn their few grains of incense before the
statue of the reigning Emperor--the representative of an ordered and
moral state--we know what happened. You cannot make an abstraction
"alive and deify Government. Laws, which have the sanction only of"
"expediency, do but furnish mankind with exercise in evasion."
is derived from the art of advertisement. The science of psychology owes
a great deal to advertisers. In former days most psychologists would
probably have thought that a man could not convince many people of the
excellence of his own wares by merely stating emphatically that they
"were excellent. Experience shows, however, that they were mistaken in"
this. If I were to stand up once in a public place and state that I am
"the most modest man alive, I should be laughed at; but if I could raise"
enough money to make the same statement on all the busses and on
"hoardings along all the principal railway lines, people would presently"
become convinced that I had an abnormal shrinking from publicity. If I
were to go to a small shopkeeper and say: “Look at your competitor over
"the way, he is getting your business; don’t you think it would be a good"
plan to leave your business and stand up in the middle of the road and
"try to shoot him before he shoots you?”—if I were to say this, any"
small shopkeeper would think me mad. But when the Government says it
"with emphasis and a brass band, the small shopkeepers become"
"enthusiastic, and are quite surprised when they find afterwards that"
"business has suffered. Propaganda, conducted by the means which"
"advertisers have found successful, is now one of the recognized methods"
"of government in all advanced countries, and is especially the method by"
which democratic opinion is created.
There are two quite different evils about propaganda as now practised.
"On the one hand, its appeal is generally to irrational causes of belief"
"rather than to serious argument; on the other hand, it gives an unfair"
"advantage to those who can obtain most publicity, whether through wealth"
"or through power. For my part, I am inclined to think that too much fuss"
is sometimes made about the fact that propaganda appeals to emotion
rather than reason. The line between emotion and reason is not so sharp
"as some people think. Moreover, a clever man could frame a sufficiently"
rational argument in favour of any position which has any chance of
being adopted. There are always good arguments on both sides of any real
It must also be said that even when we admit that a strong emotion may
symbolically construct an elaborate dream edifice which needs analysis to
"be interpreted, we narrow the process unduly if we assert that the emotion"
is necessarily a wish. Desire is certainly very fundamental in life and
very primitive. But there is another equally fundamental and primitive
"emotion--fear.[158] We may very well expect to find this emotion, as well"
"as desire, subjacent to dream phenomena.[159]"
"The infantile form of the wish-dream, alike in adults and children, is"
"thus, there can be little doubt, extremely common, and, even in its"
"symbolic forms, it is a real and not rare phenomenon. But it is impossible"
to follow Freud when he declares that all dreams fall into the group of
"wish-dreams. The world of psychic life during sleep is, like the waking"
"world, rich and varied; it cannot be covered by a single formula. Freud's"
subtle and searching analytic genius has greatly contributed to enlarge
our knowledge of this world of sleep. We may recognise the value of his
contribution to the psychology of dreams while refusing to accept a
premature and narrow generalisation.
The wish-dream of the kind elaborately investigated by Freud may be
"accepted as one type of dreaming, and a very interesting type, but it"
seems evident that it is only one type. There are even other types which
"seem closely related to it, and yet are quite distinct. This is, for"
"instance, the case with the contrast-dream. The contrast-dream of Näcke's"
type represents the emergence of characteristics which are distinctly
"opposed to the dreamer's character and habits. Thus, in the course of four"
"consecutive nights, I have dreamed in much detail that (1) I was the mayor"
of a large northern city about to take the chair at a local meeting of the
Bible Society; (2) that I was a soldier in the heat of battle; and (3)
that I was meditating the step of going on the stage as a comedian--the
only rôle of the three which seemed to cause me any nervousness or
"punishable by law, at least under the empire.[8] The authorities hesitated"
between the respect due to the powerful goddess that had delivered Rome
from the Carthaginians and the reverence for the _mos maiorum_. They solved
the difficulty by completely isolating the new religion in order to prevent
its contagion. All citizens were forbidden to join the priesthood of the
foreign goddess or to participate in her sacred orgies. The barbarous rites
according to which the Great Mother was to be worshiped were performed by
Phrygian priests and priestesses. The holidays celebrated in her honor by
"the entire nation, the _Megalensia_, contained no Oriental feature and were"
organized in conformity with Roman traditions.
A characteristic anecdote told by Diodorus[9] shows what the public feeling
was towards this Asiatic worship at the end of the republic. In Pompey's
"time a high priest from Pessinus came to Rome, presented himself at the"
"forum in his sacerdotal garb, a golden diadem and a long embroidered"
robe--and pretending that the statue of his goddess had been profaned
demanded public expiation. But a tribune forbade him to wear the royal
"crown, and the populace rose against him in a mob and compelled him to seek"
"refuge in his house. Although apologies were made later, this story shows"
how little the people of that period felt {53} the veneration that attached
to Cybele and her clergy after a century had passed.
"Kept closely under control, the Phrygian worship led an obscure existence"
until the establishment of the empire. That closed the first period of its
"history at Rome. It attracted attention only on certain holidays, when its"
"priests marched the streets in procession, dressed in motley costumes,"
"loaded with heavy jewelry, and beating tambourines. On those days the"
senate granted them the right to go from house to house to collect funds
for their temples. The remainder of the year they confined themselves to
"the sacred enclosure of the Palatine, celebrating foreign ceremonies in a"
foreign language. They aroused so little notice during this period that
almost nothing is known of their practices or of their creed. It has even
"with a man, a friend, she revealed to him a secret of a woman friend's."
"Then, realising her betrayal of confidence, she decided that the best"
"thing she could do would be to kill the man. On reflection, however,"
"she thought that it would, after all, be unkind to do so since he was a"
"friend, and so told him that if he ever repeated the secret she would have"
him torn to pieces. It will be seen that the betrayal of a secret was
"felt as a far more serious offence than murder. The facility with which,"
"in such dreams as this, the suggestion of murder presents itself, even to"
"dreamers who, when awake, cherish no bloodthirsty or revengeful ideas, is"
certainly remarkable.
It is often said that in dreams erotic suggestions present themselves with
"extreme facility, and are eagerly accepted by the dreamer. To some extent"
"there is truth in this statement, but it is by no means always true. This"
"may be illustrated by the following dream, the sources of which could"
be easily traced; two days before I had seen the gambols of East Enders
"at Hampstead Heath on a Bank Holiday, and the day before I had visited"
"a picture gallery, the two sets of impressions becoming ingeniously"
"combined, according to the usual rule of dream confusion. I thought that"
when walking along a country lane a sudden turn brought me to a broader
"part of the road covered with grass, into the midst of a crowd of women,"
"large and well-proportioned persons, mostly in a state of complete"
"nudity, and engaged in romping together, more especially in tugs-of-war;"
"some of them were on horseback. My appearance slightly disturbed them, I"
"heard one cry out my name, and to some extent they drew back, and partly"
"desisted from their games, but only to a very slight degree, and with"
"no overpowering embarrassment. I was myself rather embarrassed, and,"
"glancing at them again, turned back. Afterwards my walk again brought"
"me in view of them, and it occurred to me that women are somewhat"
"changing their customs, a very wholesome change, it seemed to me. But I"
remonstrated with one or two of them that they ought to keep in constant
"movement to avoid catching cold. No erotic suggestions were present,"
"case of injury to the small intestine, No. 166, on which I operated,"
there was absolutely no gross escape until the bowel was removed from
"the abdominal cavity, when the contents spurted out freely. In one case"
of very oblique injury to the colon there was a considerable quantity of
"fæcal matter in a localised space, but as a rule the ordinary condition"
best described as 'peritoneal infection' from the wound was found. The
bad effect of anything like free escape was well shown in multiple
perforations; in these suppurative peritonitis rapidly developed and the
patients died at the end of thirty-six hours or less. A typical case is
quoted in No. 168.
"2. _Peritoneal infection, and general septicæmia._--As is evident from"
"the results quoted among the cases, the degree which this reached varied"
greatly. It may of course be assumed that in some measure it occurred in
"every case in which the bowel was perforated, but it was sometimes so"
slight as to be scarcely noticeable. This may be said to have been most
"common in injuries to the large intestine. Wounds of the cæcum,"
"ascending and descending colon, the sigmoid flexure, or the rectum, were"
"sometimes followed by no serious symptoms, either local or general."
"Again in these portions of the bowel the development of local signs, and"
"the later formation of an abscess, were by no means uncommon."
"In the case of the small intestine I never observed this sequence, and"
"the same may be said of the transverse colon, which in its anatomical"
arrangement and position so nearly approximates to the small bowel. In
suspected wounds of these portions of the bowel either the symptoms were
"so slight as to render it doubtful whether a perforation had occurred,"
"or marked signs of general peritoneal septicæmia developed, and death"
resulted.
The condition of the peritoneum in fatal cases varied much. In some a
"dry peritonitis, or one in which a considerable quantity of slightly"
"well as the wicked in one punishment. Often, also, the divine anger was"
thought to be as ridiculous in its manifestations as in its cause. The
rural superstitions of the country districts of Latium continued to live in
the pontifical code of the Roman people. If a lamb with two heads or a colt
"with five legs was born, solemn supplications were prescribed to avert the"
misfortunes foreboded by those terrifying prodigies.[19]
All these puerile and monstrous beliefs that burdened {37} the religion of
the Latins had thrown it into disrepute. Its morality no longer responded
to the new conception of justice beginning to prevail. As a rule Rome
remedied the poverty of her theology and ritual by taking what she needed
"from the Greeks. But here this resource failed her because the poetic,"
artistic and even intellectual religion of the Greeks was hardly moral. And
"the fables of a mythology jeered at by the philosophers, parodied on the"
stage and put to verse by libertine poets were anything but edifying.
Moreover--this was its second weakness--whatever morality it demanded of a
pious man went unrewarded. People no longer believed that the gods
continually intervened in the affairs of men to reveal hidden crimes and to
"punish triumphant vice, or that Jupiter would hurl his thunderbolt to crush"
the perjurer. At the time of the proscriptions and the civil wars under
Nero or Commodus it was more than plain that power and possessions were for
"the strongest, the ablest or even the luckiest, and not for the wisest or"
the most pious. The idea of reward or punishment beyond the grave found
"little credit. The notions of future life were hazy, uncertain, doubtful"
"and contradictory. Everybody knows Juvenal's famous lines: ""That there are"
"manes, a subterranean kingdom, a ferryman with a long pole, and black frogs"
in the whirlpools of the Styx; that so many thousand men could cross the
"waves in a single boat, to-day even children refuse to believe.""[20]"
"After the fall of the republic indifference spread, the temples were"
"abandoned and threatened to tumble into ruins, the clergy found it"
delight in doubt or surrender to it; the masses wanted certainties. There
was nothing to revive confidence in the power of a decrepit and threadbare
science. No great discovery transformed the conception of the universe.
"Nature no longer betrayed her secrets, the earth remained unexplored and"
the past inscrutable. Every branch of knowledge was forgotten. The world
"cursed with sterility, could but repeat itself; it had the poignant"
"appreciation of its own decay and impotence. Tired of fruitless researches,"
the mind surrendered to the necessity of believing. Since the intellect was
"unable to formulate a consistent rule of life faith alone could supply it,"
"and the multitudes gravitated toward the temples, where the truths taught"
to man in earlier days by the Oriental gods were revealed. The stanch
adherence of past generations to beliefs and rites of unlimited antiquity
seemed to guarantee their truth and efficacy. This current was so strong
that philosophy itself was swept toward mysticism and the neo-Platonist
school became a theurgy.
"The Oriental mysteries, then, could stir the soul by arousing admiration"
"and terror, pity and enthusiasm in turn. They gave the intellect the"
illusion of learned depth and absolute certainty and finally--our third
{35} point--they satisfied conscience as well as passion and reason. Among
"the complex causes that guaranteed their domination, this was without doubt"
the most effective.
"In every period of their history the Romans, unlike the Greeks in this"
"respect, judged theories and institutions especially by their practical"
results. They always had a soldier's and business man's contempt for
metaphysicians. It is a matter of frequent observation that the philosophy
of the Latin world neglected metaphysical speculations and concentrated its
"attention on morals, just as later the Roman church left to the subtle"
Hellenes the interminable controversies over the essence of the divine
logos and the double nature of Christ. Questions that could rouse and
"divide her were those having a direct application to life, like the"
"when they gained the foreshore, to see a large sloop hard and fast"
"on the reef, although the night was beautifully clear and the light"
was burning brilliantly. With much effort the keepers got out their
"dory, put off to the wreck, and endeavoured to get the sloop out of"
"her uncomfortable position, but, finding her too well fixed, took off"
the passengers. The survivors were housed in the keepers’ quarters
"until next morning, when they were succoured. The head-keeper asked the"
"captain how he managed to get into such a position, and to his surprise"
"learned that, as the passengers were anxious to obtain a clear close"
"view of the light, the master had stood inshore, not knowing that the"
reef over which vigil was mounted ran out far into the water. That
navigator paid dearly for his attempt to satisfy curiosity. His sloop
"broke up, since she was impaled too firmly to be salvaged."
It is not often that the utter loneliness and monotony of the daily
"round unhinges a keeper’s mind, but this awful fate overtook the warden"
of a somewhat isolated American light. The man had served with Admiral
"Dewey off Manila, and upon his return home the Government placed him in"
"charge of a station as an occupation for the evening of his life, and"
as a recompense for faithful service. He settled down with his wife and
"family, but the isolation soon began to affect his brain. For days he"
"would absent himself from the light, which would soon have failed had"
it not been for the unswerving devotion of his wife and the assistance
of one of two friends living in the locality. They spared no effort
"to keep the beacon burning, lest the authorities might hear about"
"the keeper’s strange behaviour, and deprive him of his charge, and,"
"incidentally, of his livelihood. In due course the incident did reach"
"the authorities, and, not knowing what was the matter with the man,"
they took action accordingly. As the keeper entered the station after
"one of his inexplicable expeditions of a fortnight’s duration, he was"
"arrested for desertion. He was examined promptly by two doctors, who"
"found him hopelessly insane, and was incarcerated in an asylum, where"
"[Footnote 136: See, especially the attractive book of André Pirro,"
"_L'Esthétique de J. S. Bach_ (1907), and also Albert Schweitzer, _J. S."
"Bach_ (1908), especially chapters xix.-xxiii. 'Concrete things,' says"
"Ernest Newman, summarising some of these results (_Nation_, December 25,"
"1909), 'incessantly suggested abstract ideas or inward moods to Bach, and"
_vice versâ_. He would time after time use the same musical formula for
"the same word or idea. He first suggests the external concepts of ""high"""
"and ""low,"" as other composers have done, by high or low notes, and motion"
up or down by ascending or descending themes. But Bach correlates with
"the outward, objective thing a whole series of things that are purely"
subjective. Thus moods of elation or of depression are to him the mental
equivalents of the physical acts of going up or down. So he gives us a
"whole series of ascending themes to words that express ""mounting"" states"
"of mind, as it were--such as pride, courage, strength, resolution--and"
"descending themes to words that express ""declining"" states of mind--such"
"as prostration, adoration, depression, discouragement, grief at sin,"
"humility, poverty, fatigue, and illness. For the two sets of concepts,"
"internal and external, he will use the same musical symbols. To represent"
"the physical concept of ""surrounding,"" again, he adopts the device of"
a circling or undulating theme. A crown or a garland suggests the same
"idea to him, so for this, too, he uses the same kind of theme. But"
the correspondence goes still further; for when he comes to the word
"""considering,"" he uses the same curving musical symbol once more--his"
"notion of ""considering"" being that of looking round on all sides. Again, a"
word of purely external signification that suggests something twisted will
have an appropriately twisted theme. Then come the subjective applications
of the theme--the same disordered melodic outline is used to express a
"frame of mind like anxiety or confusion, or to depict the wiles of Satan."
"Careful study of the vocal works of Bach, and especially of the cantatas,"
"has revealed a host of these curious symbols.' The whole subject, it may"
"be added, has been briefly and suggestively discussed by Goblot, 'La"
"their natural order, and begin by telling you I sailed from Leith on"
"the morning of the second of this month, with no wind at all. We"
"drifted on, I know not how, and toward evening were within gunshot of"
"Inchkeith; on the following morning we were in sight of the Bass, and"
in sight of the same we continued during the whole day. For the next
"two or three days we went beating up against a head-wind, which forced"
"us to tack so much that whenever we made one mile we travelled ten, a"
"pleasant mode of progressing, is it not? However, I had the whole ship"
"to myself, and plenty of female society in the person of the captain's"
"lady, who, being fond of pleasure, had chosen to diversify her"
monotonous existence at Leith by taking a delightful summer trip to
"Rotterdam, which confined her to her crib during almost the whole of"
our passage under the pressure of racking headaches and roaring
"sickness. She had a weary time of it, poor woman, and nothing could do"
"her any good--neither spelding, cheese, nor finnan haddies, nor bacon,"
"nor broth, nor salt beef, nor ale, nor gin, nor brandy and water, nor"
"Epsom salts, though of one or other of these she was _aye takin'_ a wee"
"bit, or a little drop. We were nearly a week in clearing our own Firth,"
and did no good till we got as far as Scarborough. At this place I had
"serious intentions of getting ashore if possible, and making out the"
rest of my journey by means that were more to be depended on. Just in
"the nick of time, however, a fair wind sprang up, and from Scarborough"
"we had a capital run, with little or no interruption, to the end of our"
voyage.' An account of a ten days' voyage which makes us thankful to be
"in great measure independent of the winds at sea! Holland, our"
"traveller thinks an intolerable country to live in, and the first"

"himself is a fine fellow, certainly, but the country through which he"
"flows is stale, flat, though I believe, not unprofitable. The banks on"
either side are covered either with reeds or with a matting of rank
"shrubbery formed apparently out of dirty green worsted, and the"
continuance of it so palls upon the senses that the mind at last
doctrine of grace.
The old religion of the Romans had to respond to this demand of their
genius. Its poverty was honest.[17] Its mythology did not possess the
"poetic charm of that of Greece, nor did its gods have the imperishable"
"beauty of the Olympians, but they were more moral, or at least pretended to"
"be. A large number were simply personified qualities, like chastity and"
piety. With the aid of the censors they imposed the practice of the
"national virtues, that is to say of the qualities useful to society,"
"temperance, courage, chastity, obedience to parents and magistrates,"
"reverence for the oath and the law, in fact, the practice of every form of"
"patriotism. During the last century of the republic the pontiff Scaevola,"
"one of the foremost men of his time, rejected as futile the divinities of"
"fable and poetry, as superfluous or obnoxious those of the philosophers and"
"the exegetists, {36} and reserved all his favors for those of the"
"statesmen, as the only ones fit for the people.[18] These were the ones"
"protecting the old customs, traditions and frequently even the old"
privileges. But in the perpetual flux of things conservatism ever carries
with it a germ of death. Just as the law failed to maintain the integrity
"of ancient principles, like the absolute power of the father of the family,"
"principles that were no longer in keeping with the social realities, so"
religion witnessed the foundering of a system of ethics contrary to the
moral code that had slowly been established. The idea of collective
responsibility contained in a number of beliefs is one instance. If a
vestal violated her vow of chastity the divinity sent a pest that ceased
only on the day the culprit was punished. Sometimes the angry heavens
granted victory to the army only on condition that a general or soldier
"dedicate himself to the infernal gods as an expiatory victim. However,"
through the influence of the philosophers and the jurists the conviction
"slowly gained ground that each one was responsible for his own misdeeds,"
and that it was not equitable to make a whole city suffer for the crime of
an individual. People ceased to admit that the gods crushed the good as

I guess he must've been the black sheep.
And it's possible that...
"Kabir didn't help him out, so he must be very upset."
What are you looking for?
Any idea how this red paper and these chemicals are connected?
"No, why?"
Mustard has the same effect on me.
Mustard?
Let's go to Mumbai then.
To see Iqbal Chand Malhotra.
I was going to say the same thing.
See you in 15 minutes.
The ward is upstairs.
Mr. Malhotra is asleep now but you can still see him.
How long has he been here?
Five years.
Stomach cancer.
Last stage.
Has he ever left this place in the past five years?
"This is a sanatorium, Ms. Agnihotri."
Not a jail.
Patients are free to move in and out.
"But, as far as I know, Mr. Malhotra never left this place."
Look at that.
Another p--pregnant female.
There.
Which cake?
One of those or one of those?
-
"- No, thank you."
I don't think so.
-
- A bit of cream's all over it.
"Really, I only came in looking for French cigarettes."
I don't suppose you have any French cigarettes.
"No, but we have English ones you can s--smoke with a foreign accent!"
-
- I only smoke the French.
-
- Best thing that could happen to them!
I remember a shop like this when I was a child.
"Yes, so do I. This is it!"
-
- It's long since been condemned.
-
"- As a matter of fact, we are on the verge of the same thing ourselves."
-
- Really?
-
- On account of the frats.
-
- The frats?
-
- Yes.
They're everywhere.
Let's slaughter a cow!
"Baso, grab it!"
Grab its legs!

Come!
"Have a drink with us, sir"
No
- No
"- Come on, have a drink"
No way
I don't drink the wine with your nasty saliva in it
"- Come on, have a drink"
- I told you that I don't want to
Your hand is all dirty with blood
- I invited you with good will
- You son-of-a-bitch!
You've soiled me with blood!
I offered you a drink and you hit me?
I'll beat you into senses!
- Stop!
- I don't need to reason with a savage
What is it?
Let's go look!
Hurry up!
I know what you said just now with a boar's head in your hand
Out of my way!
"And eww, why're you so dramatic?"
My hit points are going down
Sent!
What'd you send?
A picture of Lin getting excited about this gross room
"It's gross, isn't it?"
Yeah
But... awesome!
Thank you
"Kidding, I'm about to puke"
Big Sis...
Obviously I'm kidding.
Otherwise it'd just be offensive
"Anyways, love what you've done with the place"
Now it's not sad!
"The bathtub is pretty cool, too"
Really?
Can I take a look?
Of course.
This way
"Lin, come too"
Ok.
Can I take pics?
Sure
Holy crap!
Gross!
I didn't do anything with my life
That hunting today got me thinking
"When I was younger, I just watched anime or went to brothels and forgot about it"
"Ignoring the root of the problem, I was satisfied with immediate pleasure"
Youth is a crime
"No, I am full of potential"
"As long as you'r e all on the other side of it, yes."
What'd he say?
He said not to worry about it.
Feel like doing some tape work?
"Yeah, in a minute, but I'm gonna go see Rebecca first."

- Elevator woman?
-
- It's the menschy thing to do.
It is.
"I could blow her off, but -- -"
- But you'r e not that guy.
-
- I'm not that guy.
-
- This would be a good time to talk to him.
-
- Leave me alone.
'Cause you can see he's by himself in his office.
What makes you think Casey's inter ested in advising me on how I can get Gordon not to br eak up with me?
-
"- He's not, but he'll do it anyway."
-
- Why?
'Cause he's secr etly in love with you.
-
- He's not.
-
- He's only pr etending he's not.
"We've been through this, you and I."
"He's pr etending he's pr etending he's not so I think he is, but he's not, but he thinks he is, which doesn't matter, anyway, because I'm in love with Gordon."

I'm sorry.
I can't accept this.
- Eh?
Because this is totally serious chocolate.
Eh?
Ah.
Did you think I'm a really serious guy?
"A guy making chocolate is really weird, right?"
"But, you know, my family is a cake shop, so making this sort of thing is no big deal."
"So, see, there's no deep meaning to this or anything."
There's someone I'm going out with.
Huh?
"- After Christmas,"
I got back together with my ex-boyfriend.
"Since he likes to travel around, I'd been neglected,"
I thought it would be fine when Souta-kun confessed.

Michael Rodriguez is our son.
"No, yeah, I meant Michael Rodriguez."
He's got a knack for poetry.
"He writes beautifully, you know."
"It must be difficult for you, though."
How so?
"Well, I mean with the issues Michael's having."
"You know, the..."
"His refusal to use the boy's bathroom,"
"The eyeliner in class, et cetera."
"You know, all the things you and I spoke of"
A month ago Mrs. Rodriguez...
You made me look like a fool in there.
"It isn't like that, Kike."
Listen.
"No, I have been listening."
You been keeping a lot of shit from me.
I'm supposed to find out from his teacher?
"How the hell you think that makes me look, huh?"
"He's walking around out here,"
Going to the fucking girl's bathroom?
What the fuck's that say about me?
"I'm sorry, I thought this was about Michael."
"Don't fucking start, Angie!"
You don't need that shit anyway.

My Master is so unfortunate
While he was asleep...
Someone covered with blood suddenly came in
Blood?
"Y es, he was stabbed here"
He knew martial arts
Have you heard of anyone who was stabbed here and didn't die?
Who is that man?
"My friend, why're you so rude?"
Release me first
"Oh, my waist!"
T ell me quick!
"Y es, yes!"
That man was covered by blood
But he could still survive!
My Master asked him what happened
And he tried to chop him up
I sensed something was wrong so I kicked him
"Go on, speak"
"Okay, it so happened that I kicked him"
Right on where the knife was stabbed
The knife plunged in two more inches
He gave out a loud cry!
You know that?
Completely hopeless.

"We don't want any violence in here, do we?"
"Go ahead, kill me."

That direction... that would be the factory owned by Mac Bain!

There's lots of them.
"Raya, did Sorokin show up?"
"You jerk, when dad comes home"
See if you can still live!
"No, I won't dare next time!"
Maybe I'll let you touch me and we can get even!
You deserve it
He teases you!
"Huh, does that amuse you?"
"Blockhead, I guess you need a good beating"
How dare you tease your brother?
Brother!
Big Brother
That blockhead didn't respect me
Don't you think he deserves a good beat?
Forget it and continue practicing
Otherwise Master will blame us when he returns
What are you looking at?
Want a good beat?
Gao Jian!
He pretends not to hear you!
Gao Jian!
What's the matter?
Bring me two stone weights!
You can get it yourself
"I'm your elder, you should do atleast obey"
"That's right, get it quick!"
What a chicken!
And he wants to learn martial arts
He is good in bed.
Hurry up!
Hurry up!
Quick!
"Gao Jian, kneel down!"
Help!
- Gunther.
Where's Margaret?
"- Don't worry, ma'am."
I'll take care of you.
- You're home now.
- Roderick.
- So I looked into...
- The Aconite Society.
- Yeah.
- And?
- There are whispers of a secret order made up of society's wealthiest and most influential men.
- And?
- And whispers are about all anybody would say about it.
"- Thomas... if it's money you want, I'm in no short supply."
- I don't want your money.
- I'll make it worth your while.
"- Listen, I have some advice for you."
Leave this alone.
"Even if half of these stories are true, they run everything:"
"the courts, the papers, the banks."
- All Rosewood?
- I don't know.
- Is Dr. Cairn one of them?
- I don't know a Dr. Cairn.
- What about the girl Lucy that I saw?
Is Mr. Baxter involved with these people?
- Listen to me.
I don't want anything to do with this.
- There's gotta be something more you can give me.
Please.
- That's all I can tell you.
"Oh, um, okay."
"Uh, well, you'll do."
- Flattered.
- Sorry.
"Listen, Leena, you know that 800-year-old sword"
That we were swapping out?
"Uh, well, it turns out, a piece of it has come up missing."
"So if--if--if you were standing next to Artie, right,"
"And he was looking for this thing,"
Wh--what--what would he be doing?
Artie did say that the sword was from the Edo period.
So instead of trying to track it forward
"From the past, just find it in the present."
Identify any collectors that deal in that period
And then try and find as much information as you can
On any sales or transactions of those pieces.
- Right.
Right.
Right.
"Uh, since-- since you're right there,"
"Do--do you think that, uh, maybe you could, uh..."
"Give me a minute, Pete."
"One point, Lattimer."
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello!
Hello!
"Oh, you should've kept your promises, Erik."
"The tsuba, did you find it?"
- Well--
"- Well, it wasn't easy."
"You know, it--it took some digging."
The concert was today?
You could make a little planter out of it.
I'm sorry!
I've gotta go!
"Thank you, Scuttle!"
"Any time, sweetie!"
Any time.
"Yes, hurry home, Princess."
"We wouldn't want to miss old Daddy's celebration, now, would we?"
Ha!
"Celebration, indeed."
"Oh, bah!"
"In my day, we had fantastical feasts,"
- when I lived in the palace.
- [Whimpers]
[Gulps]
And now look at me.
Wasted away to practically nothing.
"Banished and exiled and practically starving, while he and his flimsy fish folk celebrate."
"Well, I'll give 'em something to celebrate soon enough."
Flotsam!
Jetsam!
I want you to keep an extra close watch on this pretty little daughter of his.
She may be the key to Triton's undoing.
"I just don't know what we're going to do with you, young lady."
"Daddy, I'm sorry."
I just forgot.
As a result of your careless behavior...
Careless and reckless behavior!
"...the entire celebration was, uh..."
"Well, it was ruined!"
That's all!
"Heather, there is a doctor here to see you guys."
I cannot believe you're calling in outside help when I'm right here.

Oh.

my three boyfriends before that.
None of them had steady jobs.
And all of them were these dreamers addicted to romance.
"- Yeah, you really do only date your father."
- Yeah.
You guys only got me for another 18 minutes.
You want me to dance or anything?
- Um...
- Can you unload the dishwasher?
(sighs)
"Anyway, I've done some soul-searching, and I think I've finally figured it out."
- I haven't told anybody this...
- HEATHER:
I think that sounds like a natural stopping point right there.
So great to catch up with you.
And may you find all well when you come back.
"- Say thy prayers, go to bed before dusk, and no harm will come to thee."
"Ah, my poor Faith."
What a wretch am I to leave her.
- You are Goodman Brown.
Forget your past and become him entirely with every inch of your being.
Go.
Go.
"- Dearest heart, pray thee put off your journey till sunrise and sleep in your own bed tonight."
"- My love and Faith, of all nights in the year, this one night must I tarry away from thee."
Bravo.
You're ready.
"Only three weeks in, and you're already a better Brown than Lucy ever was."
This will be greatest performance they've ever seen.
- Performance?
I don't understand.
"- Forgive me, Goodman."
"A momentary flight of fancy, nothing more."
Come.
You've been working all day in the field.
You deserve some rest.
"- Oh, God."
"""Mr. and Mrs. Baxter,"
"""you're invited..."

"Come, my dear."
Are you ready to see?

What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino...
... sohecouldgiveup what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John 's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag...
... butalsoto fillitwith  things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.
Take a right at this gas station...
... becausewearealmostthere.
Thank you.
Vinnie sure likes strange places.
It looks like Monday night in Key Largo.
He's impersonating Mafia.
Vinnie Zapatti's a joke to his uncle...
... buta dangerousjoke.
Pishsalver.
Let me think.
"A pinch of worm fat, urine of the horsefly,"
buttered fingers.
My sister preferred to study Dominion Over Living Things.
(SIZZLING)
"Tell me, how does she seem to you?"
Perfectly horrid.
-And her head?
-Bulbous.
"I think she may have some kind of growth in there, something pressing on her brain."
"Three coins from a dead man's pocket, two teaspoons of wishful thinking."
You can't imagine the things that go on in that place.
"Oh, yes, I can."
"But when a champion steps forth to slay the Jabberwocky, the people will rise against her."
(SPITTING)
That should do it.
Blow.
-Feel better?
"-Much, thank you."
There's someone here who would like to speak with you.
-Absolem?
-Who are you?
(COUGHING)
I thought we'd settled this.
"I'm Alice, but not that one."
-How do you know?
-You said so yourself.
"I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now."
"In fact, you're almost Alice."
"Even so,"
I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.
"Well, I could."
I don't know where Enid resides.
You are reckoning without the Brierley Nymphs
And Shepherds Association clipboard.
"As a matter of fact, the firm she works for happens to be in this building."
Does it?
Is it?
"We'll have to hack it back, Frank."
Seepage.
Lovely.
"Aye, you can smell the damp."
"Mr Kirkby, could you get everyone in lines, please?"
"You, there."
"You, on the end."
Stand up straight.
"Good evening, everybody and welcome back."
"Good evening, Miss Riall."
"Now, we have some new children with us."
"Could they put up their hands, please?"
Hands down.
"Now, the other children have heard this before, but being in the Manchester School Children's Choir is a great privilege and with privilege comes what, Hewitt?"
What?
With privilege comes what?
Comes what?
"""Comes what, Miss Riall?""!"
"Comes what, Miss Riall?"
"What does privilege come with, you nitwit?"
"I give up, sir."
It comes with this.
Chump.
"Well, it comes with responsibility, doesn't it?"
"Now, we have got a lovely new song to learn by Purcell."
To help you and Victor
He isn't safe here I know what happened to him.
"He's not the only one I don't know what you mean lf you stay, you're putting Victor at risk"

Not a chance
Pack your things
The power could be down for a while
Do you want to go out?
No
Shall we play a game?
OK
Truth or dare?
OK
Truth
How old was I when Dad killed himself?
You weren't born
So he never saw me?
No
Did he want to die because of me?
No
Was it because of you?
It's complicated
You're too young to understand I'll ask Thomas.
At least he will tell me the truth
It's natural that you want to know
"But the truth is, I have no idea"
You don't know why he did it?
No
Was he unhappy?
"Sometimes, he was"
"Other times, he wasn't"
Why was he unhappy?
With a pistol... as was the custom of this kind of execution...
"He fired the ""coup de grace""."
Do you believe in God?
"No, but I enjoy the tranquility here."
Want to check the gun?
I trust you.
Another quiet tear
Streaks down my face
Another night ofdesolation
And solitude
Just accept me
For what I am
Don't make promises
That you won't keep

When we have each other
Who needs tomorrow
When we have today
- I can't see.
- Your corneas are badly damaged.
- Will I recover?
- Your sight will never be perfect.
- My sight is so blurred!
- We can do an operation transplant.
Will I be blind?
"Jenny, I'm Sergeant Chang."
Do you remember the murderer's face?
"Please, leave me alone."
I'm frightened.
Calm down.
SIX MONTHS LATER
Thank you so much!
- Mom really did that?
"- Oh, she did!"
Wow!
I did not see that coming.
What about you?
- Are you OK?
"- Oh, I couldn't be better!"
Even with the town not getting behind the mosque
- Like we thought they would?
- I'll bring them around.
"And you getting arrested for that whole non-bomb thing, plus Fred Tupper trashing you on the radio?"
- I couldn't believe that!
"- Look, remember when I came"
- To Mercy five years ago?
- Uh-huh.
"Those exact same things happened to me, and look how that turned out."
- It turned out pretty well.
- I think we're right on course.

[ knock!
knock!
] What's going on?
Charles called.
My cell battery died.
I'm waiting for him to call back.
Have you been waiting here all weekend?
- Yes!
"- Oh, Ann!"
Why does he have to live in Ottawa?
Why does he have to be engaged to somebody else?
Why is he such a stupid jerk?
Stop trying your Yiddish out on me.
You sound like a Shakespearean actor from a Savannah pogrom.
- But do you know him?
- Sure.
But the trial was 2 years ago.
I was long gone from the department.
"Hello, Larry."
Good to see you.
This is Deputy Mayor Calhoun.
The first deputy mayor to set foot on this floor.
"We had a commissioner once, but it was the wrong floor."
- May I have a seat?
"- Please, sit."
"Abe, you're already at home here."
I think I know why you're here.
I've logged 12 calls already.
Tino Zapatti.
- You want to know why I handled it.
- Exactly.
Because sometimes we get overloaded.
And you take on the extras?
The extra-specials.
Such as Zapatti family members?
Something like that.
- Mr. Deputy Mayor...
"- ""Kevin""'s good enough."
Any case that comes here that looks like it's connected I take a special interest in.
- Why's that?
- To avoid making mistakes.
You sure made one on this.
"I blew one, okay?"
I don't mind admitting it.
- about Carlos Mejia?
- Anything I told you.
"- No, I have not."
- You sure?
Yes.
"- Bryan, I'd never..."
"- Well, they found out somehow."
- Who found out?
Found out what?
- Mexican Government.
"- Okay, wait."
Slow down...
- Probably the cartel too.
And you think that's because I said something to someone?
- Not even accidentally?
- Like at the hair salon or something?
That's not what I meant.
I thought we understood each other.
Respected...
No.
"Actually, I thought it was quite a bit more than just that."
I am the one person who understands what you've gone through at the hands of this monster Mejia.
And now you're accusing me of betraying you?
- Not betraying me.
"- So what, then?"
"I had to ask, Asha, and I know you know why,"
- so don't act like you don't...
- I'm not confused.
I'm upset.
You immediately suspect me.
People at your job knew too.
They keep secrets for a living.
Tomorrow's another day.
Time to go to the bar.
-Karaoke?
"Sure, karaoke."
He comes and goes His roads nobody knows
A traveling man he is
Nice to see you normal like us.
Without the superman stuff.
"Thank you for the dark motions, Jakki."
"Next, the indisputable local tango queen:"
Marjukka!
You came like a flame that day
"Charming, intoxicating"
"You came to me, took my heart I was yours, all yours..."
Look who's here!
The mad loser.
You're sitting in my chair.
Your place is in the back.
Never knew the perils Of the burning flame
Never knew it could bum The happiness to ashes
I looked into the flame Brilliant and burning
You were my only one My universe
Always on my mind
Operation Ostrich is off the ground.
Did you take the scooter?
"-Yeah, I told him I'm moving."
Are you sure he didn't notice anything?
-He never does.
How's the virginity barometer?
No change.
Right.
You know what?
"For the public opinion, and in agreement with his family, he was called Juve."
Why did you hide me the truth?
I had given Monsieur Havard my word that no one would know the truth.
And I kept to my word.
Why passing up for dead?
To better track Fantomas?
Exactly.
I learned that Lady Beltham had fled to England.
I knew Fantômas would join her.
So what?
I crossed the Channel: unfortunately he had just left for Canada.
And you have changed your face.
Yes.
To start again at the same level.
"Not without difficulties,"
I got introduced to this band of hoodlums that you know.
People who may work for Fantômas?
That's right:
"Cut-Nose, Gas-light, Mother Toulouche."
Because... they began thieving again.
"Fandor, Fantomas is back."
"Why not arrest Nibet, Nose-cut"
- and the others?
- No.
"No, they are small fry."
Small-time criminals.
No.
"I let them act freely and thanks to them,"
I'm sure that I will find Fantômas.
But for now...
"""Tail-hair"" I am, and ""Tail-hair"" I will remain."
It's the name they gave you?

Where's O'Malley?
- Pukin'.
- Pukin'?
"Yeah, it was pretty bad."
"One of them was still alive when we got here, even though the rats had eaten off half his face."
"Another psycho killer, just what we needed around here."
Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch.
What do you mean?
Somebody offed some of the ghetto ghouls?
Is that what this bullshit's about?
You check it out.
I'll see ya down at the station house.
See ya later.

Why don't you finish your breakfast out by the pool?
"We stand in the shadows,"

Hidden from light.
"So is it always,"
So shall it be.
Who comes before the gural nataz?
Stand and be recognized.
"Can we do without this, rennes?"
I've had a very bad day.
We're all anxious

To show his humiliation in private.

"You can't protect him forever, rennes."
Silence!
I bring bad news.
My courier has died from the wounds
He received fighting with the two thieves.
Then where are they now?
They're being tracked according
To standard protocol.
Where is the case?
Why haven't you sent a team
To cancel fox and bailey?
"I'm seeing to it, personally."
"Very good, fabrice."
But this council will not
Tolerate another failure.

"So it is spoken,"
So shall it be.

Miss Dashwood.
Miss Marianne.

Do sit down.
Where is Miss Margaret?
I'm beginning to doubt of her existence.
"Forgive us, Mr. Ferrars."
My youngest is shy of strangers at present.
"I am shy of strangers myself, and I have nothing like her excuse."
"How do you like your view, Mr. Ferrars?"
Very much.

I am happily installed in the guest quarters.

Airport?
What kind of a name is Airport?
"Brother, people laugh out helplessness as ajoke.."
..and sometimes thatjoke becomes your name.
I am production manager in the film industry.
And I pick up and drop artists to the airport.
Artist?
You mean even the heroes and the heroines?
"Yes, everyone."
From Amitabh Bachchan to Asrani.
And from Sridevi to Aruna Irani..
..I have picked up and dropped all of..
..them to the airport more than a thousand times.
But I swear I still didnt get a chance to sit in the plane.
"Buddy, please make me meet Amitbah Bachchan once."
"Brother, now you have come to me.."
..then I will get this thing done for you.
"Okay, you stay here all alone."
Dont you have any relatives?
I do.
Who says I dont?
There is a distant uncle and so called sister-in-Iaw.
Distant uncle keeps a distance from me.
And so called sister-in-Iaw never calls me.

He used to be a truck driver before the war.
"To get him to move, I had to honk a horn."
This is a beauty right here.
Goof-off Gunther was his name.
He was a busboy before the war.
Used to open K ration boxes looking for tips...
"This is a real beauty, a hillbilly--"
"Zeke ""Ozark"" Rutlege-- the only man in the Army wore suspenders."
"Oh, they were beautiful."
"How did those meatballs ever get along in civilian life without you to watch over 'em, Sarge?"
"Oh, I shudder to think about it."
"Ah, those poor jerks-- probably going in hock to get to that reunion in New York."
"Hey, Ernie, the reunion's tomorrow night."
You'd better start packing.

"- Okay, see you later."
- Good news.
I finally have a handle on my idea for three-person chess.
That is good news.
Bye.
"Uh, do you know how I solved the balanced center combat-area problem?"
Five words:
transitional quadrilateral to triangular tessellation.
That... that's brilliant.
It's what I do.
"But wait, there's more."
I also invented two new chess pieces.
The serpent...
and the old woman.
"Okay, now I have to ask."
What do they do?
"When the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece, that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves."
All right.
"Unless... it gets to the old woman in time, in which case she sucks out the poison, turning her into the Grand Empress:"
"a piece combining the power of the knight, queen and serpent."
Elegant.
That's because it's simple.
"Okay, well, I look forward to playing with you."
And...
And what?
And a third person.
It's three-person chess.
"Oh, my god."
"Sean.Sean, you all right?"
"Holy shit, mike, he's pissing blood."
"All right, call an ambulance."
Sean?
"- Hey, franc."
- Hey.
Lot of iron on that bar.
"What is that, 200, 240?"
"Oh, I don't know, maybe 280 on a good day."
"Animale, this kid, huh?"
Yeah.
"Got a proposition for you, franco."
Yeah?
"Well, I'm very flattered, lou, but I don't believe in gay marriage."
- Hilarious.
- This kid cracks me up.
"No.Now look, we saw you beating the heavy bag into submission the other day."
"We were wondering, maybe you ever thought about stepping into the ring."
- Boxing?
"- No, bullfighting."
What are you doing?
"Look, I cornered a couple of fighters back in the day, and i think you got potential."
- You got a thunderous left.
"- Thanks, lou."
"You, uh, you used to be a boxing trainer?"
"Yeah, indeed I was."
I took joltin' joel johansson to the department title back in '86.
He had a brief but minorly successful golden gloves run.
No shit.
You guys talking about slow joel johansson?
"Want to mind your business, tommy?"
- What about supper?
- Don't worry about me.
I'II have a fiddle in the shed.
We'II get a takeaway later.
"He's weII-buiIt, your Jeremy."
Bet things can get quite rough when you two play hunt the hairy hot dog.
"Joyce, at last."
camilla Diamond.
LiIIian Gordon-Moore.
"I Iike your sweater, Joyce."
- Oh.
- I'm fond of cats myself.
"The Wicker Barn, lillian."
Pronto.
The old town was built in 1647 and I think some of the residents can remember back that far.
"- Oh, the cricket green looks lovely."
"- Ah, yes."
My husband Stuart plays.
He's a very aggressive bowler but very frisky afterwards.
You can get everything you need from this one parade of shops.
shirley Thompson flowers.
Bit low rent.
Uses her own excrement to fertilise the pot plants but I can get you a discount on everything except shrubs.
And what have we here?
"Ah, yes."
The Wicker Barn.
Mm.
"Used to sell gorgeous, hessian pIacemats."
- till it tragically burnt down.
- It looks fine to me.
"hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
Looks like they're closing early tonight.
How could you do such a thing?
"No, I don't want that one!"
I want Mario!
He's too ugly.
- Shut up!
"- No, Mario!"
"Don't worry, Sir, I'll handle it."
- I want Mario!
"Mario, it was me!"
I found him!
It was your Quirino!
"If it were up to the lawyers, you'd never get out!"
I did it!
"- Mama, are you OK?"
The Tribunal.
Mama.
"- Oh, God, here we go."
"Oh God, what now!"
"In the name of the Italian people, by article 479 of the Criminal Code, this tribunal acquits.."
"- Valeria, did you hear?"
Acquitted!
".. of the Code for not having committed the deed, and orders the immediate release if not detained for another reason."
- Mario!
"In this moment, I must inform Mario De Santis, who is present of having incriminated himself.."
"- What, Sir!"
- Nothing.
.. the crime of autocalumny!
"Autocalumny, what's that?"
"- Don't worry, it's a misdemeanor of 1-3 years."
"Because having confessed before this Court, he blamed himself for the crime of bigamy, which he knew had never happened."
This is the warrant.
- The warrant?
But you don't seem to care.
Who cares about a bunch of nurses powdering their noses?
"When are we gonna get those new movies you promised, huh?"
- [ All Clamoring ]
"- Patience, everybody."
Patience.
"At this very moment, an emissary is tracking down one of Hollywood's finest."
"- Oh, yeah."
Sure.
- Here comes Mr. Show Business now.
"Any luck, ""Shobe""?"
"So far, the only nibble is a movie called Terror in the Tiny Town."
It's a Western with an all-midget cast.
"- Oh, great."
"What do we do, show it on a pillowcase?"
- With selected tall subjects.
I'm serious.
It's a real movie.
You guys stink.
Who wants to see a shrimp cowboy?
[ All Clamoring ]
You want a morale problem?
What about mine?
"- The food in this place is disgusting, right?"
- [ All ] Right!
"- Well, I don't cook it, right?"
- Right!
But who has to stand over this slop every day... and listen to everybody's gripes and dumb jokes about it?
- Who?
- Me!
"Well, I've had it!"
"If you don't like the swill here, talk to the cook!"
"Here, here, here."
"Sweetheart, is he annoying you?"
"Well, no."
No one beneath me could hurt me and no one above me would hurt me.
What a beautiful sentiment.
"Now, you let her finish."
Music.
Cooing.
"* Cooing, billing birds of spring *"
* Come back each year and sing and sing *
"Cooing and billing birds of spring, come back and..."
"Pardon me, something is bothering you?"
- I forgot the words.
- That's fine.
* Oh that is what he taught me to.. *
* Spreading sunshine and gladness *
* And teaching lessons of love
"* Fluttering, chirping birds of spring * [yodeling]"
[yodeling continues]
What a lovely pizzicato.
"To you, that's a pizzicato."
"To me, that's a pizzinati."
"I know, music."
[yodeling]
"All my life, I've looked forward to America."
"I suffered fire, floods, pestilence, and starvation to get here."
"And when I arrive, what does America give me?"
- A hillbilly.
- Oh.
"Now, you see what you've done?"
I warn you.
"Any more insults, and I take my money and Miss Chummy out of this production."
And did I mention that Kain Frazier and I scrimmaged together at the rink?
He's good.
It's date night.
Riley and Shayne sitting on the couch...
Just drop it guys.
"Look, I'm staying home, all right?"
"You totally have to go, man."
"Baker's goofy, but she's hot."
"I don't know, man."
"Like, if Tweaker gets in that candy, man, he's like a werewolf at full moon."
"Okay, give some credit to A-train and Big Daddy Precious."
We could take care of this house.
No worries.
- Just one thing in return.
- Details.
K-l-S-S-l-N-G
"- Hey, entrez vous."
- Here.
I hand-picked them from Precious' flower garden.
Thanks.
"- So, I made pizza."
- Boogers and butt cheese?
"Greasy, grimy gopher guts."
Mutilated monkey meat.

"No, it's tofu, pepperoni, organic goat cheese and cream spinach sauce."
Yummy.
- ...just because...
"- You're in a cafeteria, Mr. McCullers with kids trying to have lunch."
"I don't think that's the audience you want, is it?"
"Hello, Mrs. Marin."
I'm James Leland.
"Have a seat, Mr. Leland."
I'm sorry.
My regular assistant didn't make your appointment.
All I know is...
- ...you need to speak to an officer.
- Ah.
I'm Esther Potter's nephew.
She died recently.
I'm sorry.
She was a loyal customer.
"I'd like to talk to you about her accounts, her safety deposit box."
Um...
"Actually, we were under the impression Mrs. Potter had no living relatives."
She certainly was the last of the Potters.
"Her sister married my grandfather up in Syracuse, where I'm from."
I think technically that makes me a great-nephew.
Yes.
"Well, uh, the State Revenue Agency will need to see your ID before I can release any information or give access to the safe deposit box."
- I thought so.
- Yeah.
I brought copies.
"Oh, good."
Leland  Daley?
"Yes, we're architects."
I will get these to the Revenue Agency.
It's a little late in the day to expect a response.
I have business in the area.
"Fine, I'll give it to you straight."
His daughter's letter?
"She's dead, Neil."
- When?
- January 2006.
Then what's this?
If his daughter died in January... how could she have written this letter in June?
This means Natasha Malhotra is the killer?
"But, where is she?"
- You?
- Good evening.
How did you get in?
Through the door.
I'm sorry... is there something wrong?
Yeah.
"I prefer the next piece, it's a... a lot more dramatic."
I don't understand.
Five years ago...
Samara Shroff joined Kabir Malhotra's empire as his executive assistant.
He didn't know her.
But...
Samara knew him very well.
"Because she was, his brother, Iqbal Chand Malhotra's daughter."
"Isn't that right, Natasha?"
Natasha?
"Mr. Menon, is this a joke?"
Mr. Kabir Malhotra was dying of cancer.
And your father was his legal heir.
Making sure that it stayed that way was crucial.
And for the past five years... you were doing just that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mr. Malhotra wasn't aware that when he was telling us the truth... it affected someone else... a lot more.
"We didn't really play, I just listened to Big Sis and Miyu discuss BL"
Must have been awesome
"But a little while ago, 6 months to be exact..."
"No, 8 months ago?"
Miyu started dating someone
Why does having a boyfriend make her a sex slave?
Lin named her that.
He's darker than you think.
Beware
That's pretty scary...
Maybe with me too?
"No, don't worry."
I have absolutely no interest in you
"Oh, umm..."
I was just kidding.
Sorry
It was a joke?
Yes
The sex slave thing is a joke too
She did sexual things before us and became braggy
So we started competing who could be meaner to her
The way we would compete was...
These things happen because she fell for the wrath of pleasure
I don't really get it
And since when can't you get ahold of her?
About a month...
"No, 4 weeks"
"No, 29 days"
You can't get ahold of her at all?
Yep
That's worrisome isn't it?
Yep
And deaf. I couldn't hear anything
"Then gradually, I was able to make out figures around me"
The other children?
Yes
But I couldn't see them very well l just felt their presence like spirits
I remember Audrey was one of them
She called to me
Victor?
Come here
Why did you come to see me?
is it because I'm like you?
It's because of the fairy
The fairy?
What fairy?
She's supposed to protect me until Mum comes back
Mum said I would recognise her
Who is this fairy?
You think it's me?
"No, I'm not a fairy"
"Fairies have nice hair, pretty dresses..."
They are always smiling
They have magic wands I don't have any of that
Can I?
You remember Victor I'm not here for him
"What is it, then?"
It's the power failure
"We don't know how long it will last, so we're checking everyone is OK"
People are worried.
The shops have shut
Do you have all you need?
"Yes, I'm fine."
Thank you
Excuse me.
you piece of shit.
Know this kid?
Yeah.
Know where he lives?
Yeah.
You deliver mail to his house?
Yeah.

Another letter from school goes to that kid's house head first.
That was it.
No more letters from truant officers.
No letters from school.
no more letters from anybody.

That's our love-story
That's our life-story
Landed the job!
My project is through
I'm elated
You'll see Jai here.
Look into the camera when you speak
Hi Om
Jai... how are you?
"I'm fine, how are you?"
"- Okay, I'm okay"
What about your results?

Hi sister-in-law
How have you been?
Fine.

Ow!
"Sorry, sir."
I think we just lost our Helots.
- What?
- They went out with a bang.
- You mean the patrol's been ambushed?
"- It reads that way, sir."
That Hunda and his rabble are becoming more than just a nuisance.
"Well, the teleport audio system seems to be working all right."
"Orac, how do the sensors check?"
The sensors are clear.
- So what went wrong?
- Hard to say.
What did you do?
What any skilled technician does with solid-state circuitry.
He kicked the living quartz out of it.
It's probably one of the relay triggers.
I'm...
Don't tell me you're claustrophobic.

"--Happens, our thoughts go to terrorism."
I've had enough of this.
Walker told us to stay where we are.
"Madam Secretary, gentlemen I'm gonna ask you to accompany us to the Blue Room."
- Who is this man?
- He is...
- He's a concerned citizen.
"- Good morning, Mr. Secretary."
- You killed the secretary of defence.
"- Well, he wasn't doing a very good job."
"Okay, so, would the remaining secretaries please join us in the Blue Room?"
"- Sir, I'm on with Agent Reid."
- How they doing?

"And there's gonna be a run on the banks, so close them now."
- You guys good?
"- Yes, sir."
You're my ex-husband's girlfriend's father.
I mean...
isn't that a little weird?
Give it one more chance.
One date.
"And if it's still weird, we'll just give it one more chance."
"Oh, you're her father."
"But when I'm with you, I'm not thinking about Old Christine."
What-- who?
"Oh, sorry, it's just that I've known my daughter longer, so"
"I refer to you as New Christine, which makes her Old Christine."
"Well, one more date wouldn't kill me."
"So... second date wasn't so bad, was it?"
No.
"In fact, I think it was better than our first date."
Wonder what's going to happen on our third date?
"Well, I'll give you a little hint:"
If it's anything like my previous third dates... you might want to work on your home run trot.
So you're still feeling okay about everything?
"Yeah, you know, so what if it's a little weird."
"Yeah, some of my best relationships have been a little weird."
"And when it's just us, not weird at all."
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

Dying over a silly dispute
Must have been a shame
At least...
If he had died in a manner more worthy of a warrior...

That's right It's just a play
A play?
This'll be your first
"Thank you, Sergeant."
- Was salute satisfactory?
"- That's the idea... only you want these fingers to fan the eyebrows, more like this."
The breeze from them fingers ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.
Now try it again.
"Very good, indeed."
"That one almost blew your turban off, didn't it?"
"Very regimental, Din."
"Keep them at it, Subedar sahib."
They may need it.
Tell the Subedar to drill the men till sundown.
"- Where did you get the bugle, Din?"
"- Please, sahib, I find when nobody looking."
Don't you know that's very naughty?
"Please, sahib, don't take away."
Bugle only pleasure for poor bhisti.
"Thank you, sahib."
- Sahib care to hear new call?
- Not now.
"Very regimental, Din."
"Company, attention!"
"Company, dismissed!"
"Let me see your tongue, Annie."
"I'd like to try it, Sergeant sahib."
Very old Indian remedy.
"All right, go ahead."
But be careful.
"If anything happens to her, I'll..."
Understand?
Cry my eyes out.
"No, sahib!"
Very little bit goes very long way.
And he dumped me in boarding school.
He tried to tell me that what happened
In the jungle had changed him.
He was going to re- dedicate his life
"To the conservation of relics,"
Make up for the time we never had.
I laughed in his face.

"Well, now taken literally,"
What's written on there
"Doesn't make any sense,"
The words are all jumbled up
And in no particular order.

None like I've ever seen.
Look at this.
"Marks on the blade,"
Like grooves over the words.
As if something's been repeatedly
"Moved back and forth,"
Like a scabbard.
Might help you solve your word puzzle.
How?
"This scabbard, if it does exist,"
Might act as an ancient
Druid message decoder.

No.
What's the name of the company making it?
Wentworth Drug.
This is gonna hurt somewhat.
I've got to remove the bullet.
"Hello, is this Nielson and Co."

"Give me a customer's man, please."
"Hello, my name is Clementi Sabourin."
I'm at the Savoy Drake.
I want to open a new account.
What are the margin requirements?
Fifty percent?
Then buy me twenty thousand shares of Wentworth Drug at the market price.
What is the stock selling at?
Two dollars?
I'll be down at your office with the money before the market opens.
What is your name?
Mr. O'Hara.
Thank you very much.
Can you tell me where I can find Mr. O'Hara?
"That desk over there, sir."
Thank you.
Mr. O'Hara?
Yes.
My name is Clementi Sabourin.
I spoke to you on the telephone.
"Oh, yes, you're the gentleman who wants to open a margin account."
"Now, would you mind signing this, please, just a formality... and I'll fill out the rest."
Can you tell me the name of your bank?
I can do better than that.
I brought you a cashier's check for twenty thousand dollars.
- It's the tour.
You can't do it.
You can't go.
Listen to me.
Cancel it.
Cancel the tour.
Cancel it.
Make them shut down the plant now.
The plant's gonna blow up while you're there.
Where are the cops?
What are they doing?
- This is McCallum's chief aide.
- They don't know yet.
Have you received a bomb threat?
I didn't say anything about a bomb.
There's a source.
- I know this sounds...
"- You're messing up here, John."
Get me Cyrus Bills at the Post.
Our top story takes us tonight to Point Pleasant...
- where Virginia Governor McCallum...
- Turn it up!
toured the Edgewater Petrochemical plant.
In what he's called a successful review...
Governor McCallum has given high marks to this petrochemical plant.
He is expected to call for similar renovations... at several Virginia plants.
WOWK-TV 13... has an exclusive look inside at what the governor saw.
Son of a bitch.
I congratulate my friends at Edgewater Petrochemical... on a job well done.
- Success here at Point Pleasant...
"- Excuse me, Mr. Klein."
You have a message.
charles!
- (gunshot) - (gasps)
Grab it!
Grab it!
darling!
charles!
charles!
I've had the most extraordinary letter!
Madame George Sand is quite brazenly inviting herself to the fortnight!
You know the one.
She wears men's clothes and leads a most depraved life!
I'm dying to meet her.
charles?
"She writes that marriage is barbaric, darling."
They say no marriage is safe around her.
"Just think, she might take a fancy to your turkey wattIes."
Didier!
Don't touch that!
Come here!
I'm in a quandary because I've invited alfred de Musset.
Everybody knows he and Madame Sand practically tore each other to pieces.
I'm petrified that if they so much as clap eyes on each other... (howIs with rage)
Has anyone ever met this duchess?
No.
Must be one of those titled tarts stuck in the provinces with an uncouth husband.
She's probably famished for culture and determined to import it at any cost.
charles!
- Where are you going?
- Hunting.
- Goodbye.
I'II be back in a few days.
- But you can't!
- The colony collapsed.
Mites might've caused it.
"In fact, they did."
Took over every hive.
Not long after Woolsey took over Betty's Bees.
Might almost be poetic if it didn't suck so much.
Kentucky didn 't sabotage Betty's Bees with a lot of might.
- She sabotaged Betty's Bees with:
- A lot of mites.
- Take a lot of mites to cause a collapse.
- Sure does.
I grew up with generations of those bees.
The first hive was an infestation in the corner of my bedroom.
I was 5.
- I tried to kill it.
- Oh.
I was stopped.
"Mother was a Methodist and Daddy was a pragmatist, so:"
"""God put those bees there for a reason."""
- They were right.
- You lived with bees?
That sounds magical.
We called it the Honey House.
The Honey House is empty now.
"We left together, me and the bees."
Those bees built Betty's Bees.
What happened to those bees?
Could it be sabotage?
A conspiracy?
How dramatic.
You think someone intentionally murdered my bees?
- Just a thought.
I have to tell him something.
I'm expecting John any minute.
There's been another murder.
In Indiana.
Indiana?
Is there something you want to tell me?
"No, nothing."
The smell on the killer's hands... it's surgical soap.
He must take it with him.
He washes his hands with surgical soap... to get rid of the blood.
I don't like this.
Nina Getz was my patient for many years.
The man has killed 3 people.
A donor's identity is strictly confidential.
Here it is.
Leslie Davison.
"OK, follow me here."
Frank's victim...
Margaret Tattersall... had a kidney transplant 2 months ago.
So?
Our victim...
Nina Getz... had skin grafts from an organ donor... about 2 months ago.
Valerie Wheaton never had a transplant.
"No, but the woman who lived below her did."
"Emma Brody... she had a corneal transplant... and, it turns out... her apartment number is listed incorrectly... on her medical records."
This guy meant to kill Emma Brody.
Holy fuck!
OK.
"So you got the letters... and the organs, right?"
What's the connection?
I'm not done yet.
Nina Getz's donor's name... was Leslie Davison.
- You won't get bored with a life of fresh air and bird-watching and jam-making?
"Not with you by my side, Joyce HazIedine."
Ah.

"Oh, sorry."

It's like a tardis in here.
"- Ah, one of the natives at last."
- Pam Draper.
pleased to meet you.
"There's some olive tapenade, walnut bread, few organic eggs."
- I'm really touched.
- You'd never get this in the metropolis.
"And I imagine you'II find policing a place like little Stempington a Iot easier, too, once you get started."
"Ah, very observant."
Excuse me.
hello.
That's a strong grip.
You must be Joyce's personal trainer.
"You ladies of little Stempington are a friendly lot, aren't you?"
"hello, Joyce."
hilary Davenport.
welcome to little Stempington.
"- We've done that bit, hilary."
"- Oh, Pam."
What a nice surprise.
"As I was saying, you were lucky to get one on the south-facing side of the close."
[ Shaky Voice ] I am glad he's gone.
- As am I.
- B'oh!
It's probably my imagination... but something about them didn't seem quite right.
Really?
Excuse me for just a moment.
"People, that was all wrong!"
"Homer Simpson doesn't say ""B'oh."" He says--"
"""D'oh."""
"[ British Accent ] Sorry, M.B., but I'm having trouble with this character."
Is he supposed to have some kind of neurological impairment... like Rain Man or Awakenings?
"I mean, what the hell am I doing here?"
And this dialogue has none of the wit and sparkle of Murphy Brown.
"[ Low Voice ] Hey, you know we're getting into golden time?"
"Yes, well,just get it right... or you'll all be back doing Come Blow Your Horn at the Westport Dinner Theater."
All right then.
Let's see what the old Simpson family is up to now.
Duh-oh!
"[ Groans ] That's them, all right."
I can't believe it.
I guess you're the only one I can trust.
- Hmm?
Hmm?
- Dad?
- [ Bone Snaps ]
- Oh!
That rib always breaks.
[ Groaning ]
"Lisa, what are you doing?"
"Just trying to fill the void of random, meaningless destruction... that Bart's absence has left in our hearts."
- [ Yelps ]
"- That's sweet, honey."
This is worrying!
Do we really have to wait for His Majesty's decision?
"Sometimes it cannot be helped, Your Highness."
Those blasted rascals
"Everytime the Hans come around, we have to swallow our dignity."
How long is this going to last?
Hey Mu-Song.
What?
Do you want to know why someone like me can make it this far without wife and children?
That's because
I dedicated my entire life to this Iron Workshop.
"This Workshop is my wife, my children."
Now they want me to put it out of service.
Isn't that like asking me to kill my wife and children?
My condolences.
The only one who take all these sorrow away is Prince Ju-Mong.
"Prince Ju-Mong, please you must become Crown Prince and extinguish this misery for Mo Pal-Mo."
Hey watch what you're saying!
What if someone hears you?
and drink less of that wine!
Bug off!

"No matter what,"
The only person fit to be Crown Prince is Prince Ju-Mong!
I said shut it!
You rascals!
What did you say?
What about Ju-Mong?
Are you itching for death?
"Your Highness, IronSmith Leader... he's drunk"
He only said that out of brashness
Please forgive us!
You should say no
The first time you saw him was last night in the garden
You were scared and you called me
OK?
Why do I have to lie?
Because if you tell the truth they won't believe you
They don't believe in ghosts lt's our secret
OK?
Go to your room
is he dead?
He was already dead
That wasn't him
"Whoever it was, it wasn't him"
Then what was it?
"I couldn't let him torture you like that, Adèle"
What makes you think he's really dead?
What if he comes back again?
"If he does, I'll be here I'll always be here"
Do you believe me?
Come in. I've finished
- See you later
- See you
Hello
How are you feeling?
"Better, thanks I feel like I know you I was there when they took you away"
Give me your hand
Were you here while I was asleep?
I was keeping an eye on you
Just in case your attacker came back
"Thanks, Alcide"
You know my name?
"Yes, you told me when you came in"
"Now, listen."
"That left of yours is coming along nice, mate."
Alright?
"That left of yours is coming along nice, mate."
Alright?
"Cheers, mate."
Just wish I could fucking hit something with it.
"Cheers, mate."
Just wish I could fucking hit something with it.

But I did attack.
I was in a simulation controlled by Jeanine and the rest of the Dauntless that she recruited.
Tris found me.
"She managed to break me free from the simulation, and then together we..."
Together we fought our way out.
So you're saying that Jeanine orchestrated this attack?
Yes.
One last thing.
"If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless, why didn't you just leave?"
Why did you stay?
(BREATHING HEAVILY) I wanted 110 leave.
But I fell in love with Tris Prior.
And I couldn't leave her.
Thank you for your candor.
ALL:
Thank you for your candor.
JACK:
"Tobias Eaton, this trial is concluded."
And you are absolved of guilt in the attack on Abnegation.
"Miss Prior, if you would."
May the truth set you free.
"Tris Prior,"
Mr. Eaton said you managed to free him from the sim.
TRIS:
Yes.
JACK:
So you were never under the simulation yourself?
No.
How is that possible?
Because I'm Divergent.

A date.
You and me.
"Dining, dancing, perhaps you'd like to take in a prizefight."

"God, are you trying to make Amy jealous?"
"Yes, it's the Queen."

The man is positively aglow.
"We must be better at ""morale-ing"" than we thought, Hawk."

"Hey, Beej, I got a great way to end the war."

You missed some good food and a great time.
"Thank you, gentlemen, but you need not concern yourselves."

One of our officers was forced to shoot Batman.
And the Boy Wonder has become one of Gotham City's ten most wanted men.
Boys.
Is he there hiding out?
"No, I'm afraid not, sir."
But-
- But isn't it possible that a mistake has been made?
No mistake was made.
Why?
"Well, it's a long and rather involved story, sir."
"You see, earlier today, Batman activated the Batcomputer via his remote control Batcomputer oscillator."
Remote control?
"I took the liberty of getting some information from the, uh, Batcomputer myself."
"Batman activated the computer from, uh, ""411 Larva Drive."""
-411 Larva Drive.
-Larva Drive.
Sounds like a good place for Black Widow's hideout.
Thank you.
We'll get on it right away.
"Get some men and some squad cars, and let's go."
"I'm back, boys."
"Well, now, after a brief encounter with the law and a quick change in the lady's lounge-- Oh, Grandpa's back too on the porch."
Guess what I have in this tiny little bag.
- More stolen money?
-What else?
"Oh, Batman, you were out of this world."
"And, of course, I was adorable as baby Boy Wonder."
Robin's pretty good as a Boy Wonder too.
"You bet I am, Batman."
Let's get them.
"Now, what did I do with that silly short circuiting device?"
"In looks I mean, and the way she talks."
I wouldn't love anyone with a character like mine.
"Charles, we're going to have a heavenly time alone."
"When, next morning, I saw Julia drive from the forecourt and disappear..."
"I felt a sense of liberation and peace such as I was to know... years later, when after a night of unrest the sirens sounded the ""All Clear'""."

Chris Edwards is a husband.
He's a father.
He's a general contractor.
[Morgan] Check any subcontractors who've worked with him.
"Okay, that is a humungous list."
What do you want me to do with it?
Anything that requires flames...
"plumbers, electricians, welders."
Did he fire a welder recently?
Okay.
"Uh, he's been using Vinnie's Welding and Fence, but he hasn't hired them back in months."
List of employees coming up.
- It's still a lofty handful.
- [Prentiss] Okay.
We think he's been following the investigation.
Look at volunteers with Detroit's Finest.
"Okay, I'm crossing employees with volunteers."
- Nothing.
"- Come on, baby girl, keep checking."
- There's gotta be a connection here.
"- Okay, I'm gonna long-shot it, and I'm gonna cross the Michigan business directory with the payroll company and see if I still got what it takes to find stuff."
And I do.
His name's Kaman Scott.
- [Morgan] You got an address?
- I'm working on that.

"Kaman, come on, man."

want to tell you the truth may be you'll feel good.
really?
shall we start?
from bankok ..o.p ramsai guilty..
and vikram kapoor.?
I've linked him with police.
"Infact, i wasn't with him when he commited suicide."
So how come you know he's dead.
the police department knows this.
you might have phone.
are you a police officer?
So what do I call you?
nil or arjun?
there's no need to mess up this case more
so you do think too that the kabir got killed.
Human has some strange habits as .
when the drink wine while smoking..
So their glass would must be in their left hand.
Like a kabir malhotra..
I'm also left handed.
If he's left handed...
so why he driggered gun from right hand.
but who?
there's a tale in a latin language
who's benificiry?
How many ships did you lose?
Hmm.
About half the group.
Flying out of England?
Yes.
Waddington.

"Hey, lieutenant, how'd you blow up that train with 50 guards around?"
"Well, I, heh..."
"Just lucky, I guess."
Don't let him kid you.
Cagney couldn't have pulled a sweeter job.
Here's what happened.
We're waiting at the depot at Frankfurt.
Understand?
When an ammunition train comes through the longest ammunition train you ever saw.
Understand?
"Oh, he's just giving it a big buildup."
"Actually, it was simple enough."
"I just drifted into the men's room, fixed myself up a little time bomb, broke open the window and when the train started pulling out, I just tossed the thing into an open car."
I guess there must have been some straw in there.
Yeah.
And about three minutes later you can hear it.
Boom!
Understand?
Broke every window in Frankfurt.
Understand?
It was gorgeous.
Wait a second.
I'm not through.
Understand?
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
Like someone not pickin' up after walking' their dog?
"Well, I guess so."
Like someone not eatin' everything on their plate?
"Well, I guess so."

"When he wakes up, he just keeps destroying... tons until he gets sleepy again."
I get it.
Then he's a bad guy.
That's not so.
Beerus-sama is a god.
"For there to be balance in this plane of existence, if there are gods that create, there must also be gods that destroy."
"Then he's strong, right?"
"He's on a level far beyond ""strong""."
He's capable of destroying absolutely everything there is.
Nobody stands a chance against him.
I can't wait to meet him.
Goku.
"I'm begging you, please try your hardest not to do anything stupid."
Okay?
You understand?
Got it.
"As long as he doesn't do anythin' bad, I'll keep away."
Oww...
What was that for?
.
Honestly...
What is it?
Beerus-sama...
"So that's this ""God of Destruction""..."

"Oh, your intimate needs are being catered for?"
Mmm?

Did you miss me?
You left your jacket in the cabin.
It smelt of you for the longest time.
"And then one day, I went in there and all I could smell was Uncle Frank's pipe."
"Sir, you are watching, arent you?"
I know that you might be very happy.
But you might be thinking why..

Maybe over coffee.

Why don't you wait in my office?
"No, I don't think so."
I'll expect to hear from you in the morning.
"No, no, that's wrong."
It won't go away unless you do something about it.
This is a crisis that could derail us.

Good afternoon.
Where you been?
My Brooklyn meeting.
How'd it go?
I think I just pissed up Frank Anselmo's leg.
And?
Felt good.
"Okay, Leslie."
"Tomorrow's Times, Post and News are all keeping the shooting on the front page."
"I'm sorry, John."
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I feel like I've ruined everything.
I'm so sorry.
I need to know what happened to you.
Please.
Come in.
I was a physics professor at Cornell.
Tenured.
You can look me up.
One day...
I started hearing voices.
The voices became messages.
"Before long, I was fully convinced that I was receiving... predictions of disaster from outside intelligences."
"But you were, weren't you?"
"John, I had tapes of their voices."
"I knew a building was going to blow up, and I tried to prevent it... but no one listened."
What happened?
People died.
Many people died.
"I was investigated, almost arrested."
My wife divorced me.
My kids... stopped speaking to me.
Do you know what four years in.
a psychiatric hospital can do to you?
You lose everything.
Everything...
"Oh, you'll never understand their messages."
You'll misinterpret them.
I did.
It almost destroyed me.
"In the end, it all came down to just... one simple question."
I hid it in the basement before the war.
A 60-gallon barrel.
He'll confiscate your amazing barrel without you.
Sit here quietly.
"Vanya, I'll get you acquiainted with some folks."
-Which folks?
- From the Vlasov units.
What for?
The Germans made them set all the minefields here.
They know all the passages and easily get to my house.
They either stay awayforweeks or visit us every other day.
So introduce them to Shulgin.
It is his business.
Shulgin will execute them.
And you are a scout.
-Aren't you afraid to offer such things to me?
"- No, I'm not."
-Why?
"-You a real man, Vanya."
"They are traitors, do you understand that?"
Traitors.
I'm a traitor as well.
-Have you ever shot at ourtroops?
- Never.
-Can I have yourword of honor on that?
"-Yes, you can."
Do not tell anyone about that.
Think about saving your own life.
is there anyone to feel pity for us when these boys kill us?
"Maryska, my niece."
Her parents were executed when yourtroops came in 1939.
She has the pneumonia.
"Tea, Henry."
Edie.
Thank you.
Right.
"You were absolutely right about the WI being able to cope without me, so I was just wondering if... the invitation still stands?"
"Yes, yes, of course!"
Wonderful!
May I offer you a celebratory cuppa?
"Yes, all right."
A year ago we had Henry's hanging work and you were giving us weddings and funerals at St Mary's.
Now we have nothing.
"I was just sharing out the work, Edie."
You're not the only florist in the area.
I think we both know what you're doing has got nothing to do with fairness.
"Look, if you promise to give us some more business,"
I won't enter the flower show.
I think I can win the competition without your charity.
"Thank you, though."
"Please, Mrs McCarthy, we're on our knees here."
Henry?
Henry!
Henry?
Henry!
Father.
Hemlock?
"That's what the doctor thinks, going by Henry's symptoms and the smell."
How extraordinary.
Poor Henry didn't notice the odd taste and drank the whole cup.
Probably because of his excesses last night.
How long does the doctor think he has?
Hours.
A day at most.
"It's not so shocking, and at same time it's true."
Ha!
Where is my report?
Here.
Yansky!
We'll deal with this together.
What do you look like?
You are dismissed.
The representant of the ecological committee of the UN.
"Ah, so that's him."
Could you please tell us what your first impressions were of your visit to us?
There he is!
"Really, you're right."
Sometimes even in your case it's possible to talk about intelligence.
Doctor.
-I didn't suspect that you know it.
-We scientists are one family.
Doctor Yansky is my best co-worker.
The pillar of our institution.
-Have you seen Mr. Cimrman here?
-He's at yours.
Master Miller!
I have read in Scientist your essay about the curvature of space.
Your hypothesis is absolutely crazy.
But these days crazy hypotheses have the right to be applied.
Congratulations.
Professor Horowitz.
I'm telling you here on this grain of space dust they tap excellent beer.
Come.
"I suppose, space is curved like this."
-I agree.
But...
A baloney sandwitch and water.
"God damn, your family's poor, dude."
"Hey you, fellas, wanna go see High School Musical three tonight?"
Bunch of kids from school are gonna go see it again.
What's High School Musical three?
"You know, a sequel to High School Musical one and two."
What's High School Musical one and two?
This-
- This is not even condom its only's baloney sandwitch.
What's High School Musical one-
- DUDE!
Its only V most popular thing with kids in our age group.
Yeah!
Where the hell are you guys-- b-been?
Peru.
And then I saw High School Musical three again on friday and guess who was there.
Briden Gueermo.
"Briden Gueermo, oh, he's such a dream."
I'd give anything to be with Briden Gueermo.
But he'd never go for me.
I'm nobody.
"That's not true, Red."
Everyone has something that makes him unique.
Everyone is special in their own way.
Move to the be and let your spirit out.
As long as we got each other we'll never have any trouble that's what be in francis about
"Oh, Yeah Everyone is special in their own way and we'll always be together"
What the hell are they doing?
I've no idea.
--together.
Together we stay and every kid in school is special in their own way
"Dude, girls are such fags."
How long do you think magic knockout powder lasts?
I have no clue.
That's my rush.
"Too right, lass."
Come.
Everything we need is right in front of us.

"They killed all the giant housekeepers, too?"
How are we gonna find a compass in this mess?
By looking.
Start searching.
I wonder how much treasure we could carry down the beanstalk.
"In addition to the compass, of course."
What the hell?
HOOK:
That would be Jack.
"- As in, Jack..."
- The giant killer.
With that toothpick?
It packs quite a wallop.
You'd be surprised...
"Whoa, whoa, whoa."
It's about bloody time. (SIGHS)
Um... (GRUNTS)
It's a tripwire.
Quite a security system.
"Well, that's a plausible excuse for grabbing me, but next time, don't stand on ceremony."
Let's find the compass and go home.
"All right, give me that."
"What's the matter, Bal?"
You've been woolgathering ever since we crawled out of the river.
"- You know, my time is up on May 14."
- What of that?
"You can sign on for another nine years, can't you?"
Make a man out of him.
I'm leaving the service.
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.
"I'm getting married, and I'm going in the tea business."
- Married!
- Tea business!
"Why, you're mad if..."
"March to attention, everybody!"
"Let's march in in good style, men."
- Fall in up there.
"- Left, right, left."
Tell the Sergeant to report at the office immediately.
"Yes, sir."
"Party, right wheel!"
Halt!
Left face!
Sergeants to the front!
"The wiring party's returned from Tantrapur, sir."
"Eight killed, three wounded."
Otherwise all correct.
"Very well, Sergeant."
Dismiss your men... and report at the office immediately.
"Very good, sir."
"Party, dismissed!"
"- Identical, Mitchell."
He just wanted to know when they were coming to Hawaii.
Why?
"Okay, Sofia, Dawkins has this guy Craig right now and he's gonna kill him."
The only way we can prevent that is if you tell us exactly what Dawkins said to you on the phone this morning.
He said something about a big payday.
Then asked me for my car.
Dawkins is driving a 2010 silver Chevy Malibu.
Car's got a vehicle recovery system.
- Can you track it?
No problem.
Ready.
"VIN number's two, niner, whiskey, niner, alpha, alpha, seven, niner, two, eight, one."
Give me 10 minutes.
"Hey, I pulled Dawkins jacket."
You guys gotta see this.
This guy's rasp sheet reads like a grocery list he's checking off.
"In Boston, he's jacking cars."
"In New York, he's robbing ATMs."
Then he graduates to full-on bank robberies in Cleveland.
"Cops there suspected him of murdering his partner, name of Paul Stark."
"Five million dollars they stole together, never found."
- Look familiar?
- That's Craig.
So no wonder he doesn't take Dana.
He doesn't care about her money.
He wants the 5 million he stole with Paul.
Craig.
- Kono?
I got him.
They just parked outside Pacific Rim Bank.
I watched you die.
Heh.
Shut up!
I got this one!
- Roldy?
- Please don't!
"I am in a great amount of pain, sir!"
Everybody relax.
Just calm down.
Everything is under control.
Tell 'em to turn the plane around.
These two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.
Secretary Fox.
Glad you could make it.
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack of this magnitude?
Not a fuckin' chance.
Who are these people?
Representatives of the different intelligence agencies.
I assume Secretary Whitmore's coming?
Negative.
He's on an ice fishing trip in Glacier Bay.
I'm in charge while he's gone.
"Well, shouldn't he be alerted?"
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?
Who are you again?
"Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA."
"Yeah, well, listen, Dr..."
Dipshit.
You've obviously never been ice fishing before.
"- No, I haven't."
"- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating."
The last thing anyone would want while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.
Now back off... and let me do my job.
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?
Sire.
The palace has canceled Our King.
"Ludovic, we are the Palace."
Anything he has filmed will be censored.
"I'm sorry, Mr. Lloyd."
But think a little.
His story and my film will never see the light.
"Once again, my footage was being thrown away forever."
But I could not blame him.
"After all, a king has no fate in his hand."
"At least, so I thought."
"Yes, that's fine, but we have to agree with Turkish security."
"Yes, our versions must coincide."
Nobody knows.
"Well, no one knew about the king's identity."
All right.
Goodbye.
"Sire, I have the official version proposed by the Palace."
"We left Istanbul yesterday, accompanied by Turkish security."
And our escape in the Balkans has never happened.
Mr. Duncan Lloyd?
"I, King Nicolas III, King of Belgium..."
I authorize her to do what she wants
With all the pictures and sounds
Which he recorded from the day we were at Mini Europe.
"Any pictures, sire?"
Yup.
Are you sure?
Agree.
His Majesty.
Do you think this trip is due to chance or destiny?
It must be fate.
My intuition?
Perhaps it's time you showed everyone what you are really like.
"Your feelings, your sense of humour and maybe even your flaws."
My flaws were already exposed by the media.
Nicolas the Humble?
Humbleness is an honourable trait.
Whatever they say.
Sire.
Did you manage to contact the Queen?
I couldn't get through to the palace.
- Prime Minister?
- He is not responding.
On purpose?
- We are ready.
"- Carlos, what is he doing here?"
- We are not going anywhere.
- Why is that?
The Security Service won't let us.
What again?
You have to find a solution.
We must get back home.
I'll try and reason with the Security Service.
Excuse me.
Maybe the Ambassador will be able to help us.
I'll go fetch the luggage.
"Sire, I will go and check if there is signal upstairs."
Where is the Ambassador?
- Sire.
- I can't concentrate.
The concourse...
Conc...
The concourse of cosmic and political circumstances...
- It'll look great on you!
It's a real guy-puller.
Do you know how many times I've been fucked in this dress?
Every time I go out:
"Whoa, someone's there."
- Champagne?
"- I just need to get organised, OK?"
Whatever.
I'm going out.
What about the washing up?
This is not a hotel.
Careful you don't start sounding like my mother.
I could have tried harder to find Johan.
"But hey, he was the one who knew where I lived."
(light classical music)
"Obviously, this was just another adventure of his,   and I wasn't crying over him again."
If it could be a bit more...
"Good, hard, honest work can take your mind off anything."
I'd designed the costumes for a small play that was a huge success.
"One night, this French guy was visiting the theatre."
...at the end of Act II I fell down the stairs.
Everyone was laughing.
- This is Pierre Gaultier.
- The top name at the Palais Royale.
"This is Miss Olsen, who plays the captain's first wife."
- How lovely.
- It's an honour to meet you.
- And who is this lovely creature?
"- This is Anna, our costume designer."
- Enchanté.
"- Nice to meet you, too."
Mr. Gaultier is artistic director at the Palais Royale.
"The photos are reflections of one another, right?"
"Reflections in lakes, reflections in people's eyes."
Pictures of people taking pictures.
"There were, uh--"
He was taking pictures of people taking pictures?
Yeah.
"I never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I actually owe you one, Jack."
Thank you.
"So you'll be getting me those files, then?"
"Oh, I'll get back to you on that one."
[dialing phone]
"Dozer, I think I know why the Chameleon killed Walker."
"So I'm standing in line, which is already annoying enough, and this chick--"
Are you listening to me?
"No, no, baby, I'm sorry."
I just...
I got stuff on my mind.
"So this chick, she takes a step back, and she steps on my foot, right?"
And...
Yeah?
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check my messages.
"So, was I right?"
Give me a second.
Yep.
Chameleon was carrying a camera.
Shoot it to me.
So she was taking pictures of a building?
She was staking out the place.
These pictures could've been taken months ago.
"Well, maybe not."
Marla said that Walker was adding last-minute photos to the exhibit.
- Isn't there something you'd like to say?
- There sure is.
"Kids, you tried your best, and you failed miserably."
"The lesson is, never try."
[ Laughing ] Right in the butt.
- That was great.
- [ Angry Grumbling ]
It's no use.
I guess I'll have to leave all my money to the Egg Advisory Council.
"Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
"Eggs have gotten quite a bad rap lately, you know, Smithers."
"Oh, look."
A bird has become petrified and lost its sense of direction.
"- I think it's a rock, sir."
- We'll see what the lab has to say about that.
[ Glass Shattering ]
"Why, that rapscallion is breaking all my windows."
[ Sinister Chuckling ]
- [ Excited Shouting ] - [ Doorbell Ringing ]
"[ Chuckling ] Look, Smithers."
A creature of pure malevolence.
He's the perfect one to suckle at my proverbial teat.
"You there, boy!"
What day is this?
"[ British Accent ] Today, sir?"
"Why, it's Christmas Day."
- I was talking to him.
"You, what day is this?"
- Huh?
I'll tell you what day it is.
Today is the day you become my heir.
- [ Bart Grunts ] - [ Groans ]
No more shakes.
Fine!
Force me to live with this obscene obesity.
"You know, Aunt Zelda is so unfair."
"I know it seems unfair now, but someday when you're older and wiser, you'll be able to look back on all this and get revenge."
Hey... one more shake wouldn't hurt and it would be wrong to waste perfectly good guar gum.
"Hilda, here's an interesting news item."
"""Everything Emporium president missing."""
"Oh, look, Larry King likes the new Ludlum novel."
Did you have anything to do with this?
No.
Robert Ludlum has his own publicist.
"Oh, you mean the Everything Emporium president?"
Yes.
"He was bugging me, so I turned him into one."
Ginger beer?
A bug?
"Hilda, you've got to change him back."
He is in a perfectly humane situation now that I gave him air holes.
SABRINA:
I wonder if that last milk shake made any difference.
I certainly feel lighter.
"Salem, help!"
I've disappeared!
(gasps):
I'm so sorry.
"Hey, twirl me around so it looks like I'm flying."
SABRINA:
What's happened?
!
Where am I?
!
Ishmael...
What happened brother?
You never came with me for help.
Ready for this?
"I do not know, Ish."
"Come on, Commander!"
Your team is waiting for you
All members of the UCF crew have arrived...
Ash-393 is considered to be the most sophisticated noid ever created by men.
A class one surface humanoid 300 Series.
It has full AI access.
He was the leader of Noid's rebellion.
He was.
Is dead.
"By rumors has many crimes In the Federation of Arizona,"
He recently arrived in the northeast corridor.
The reactor 12 has been turned off.
He killed 28.
"Hidden by intelligence, it is in the death zone 714."
Hidden in the death zone?
Does not sound very clever
The fusion of the nucleus has probably smoothed the brain of the Noids.
"Or, Commander?"
Not as soft as your dick.
Revenge is a bitch...
Like you!
"What, Kix?"
Stop him!
Five years ago I got a team sent to kill Ash.
We lost contact here.
There temperatures must be subarctic.
Your Iso-Gel will last 48 hours.
Bakk me up against the press now.
Please.
We need to lay off 200 in the first place.
"I'm sorry, but there is a Chinese on the phone."
"Take a message, Marianne."
He said you would rather discuss funding with him than bankruptcy with the board.
I've been thinking that maybe we should take some time off.
I can give my clients to someone else.
We can go on a trip together.
-What are you going?
-I'll going to Norway.
-Norge?
-There are work.
Cann't you send someone else?
-It is in Lifjord.
You're going back to your hometown.
I thought you hated being there.
It's an interesting business possibility.
A solar cell factory.
-It seems promising.
-Is this a strange coincidence?
-Can you stop interrogating me?
-No.
-Oh my God.
-How many times have I asked you about your past?
You will never say anything.
You give me one sentence about an unhappy childhood.
That's because there is not much more to tell.
Every year we send Christmas cards a mother I've never met.
"And now, suddenly, you are going there on business."
"These people, they are ..."
I mean...
How's Jai?
I hope he gets his degree and settles down
Come in with the chequebook
We've been childhood friends.
Don't hesitate about money... if it concerns Jai's education.
He's my brother too
Please sign there
Here's a million.
ForJai.
Repayable when able
You have taken God's place for me on earth
How's Jagadish?
- Jagadish?
"Oh, he's fine"
"I'm sure he's going to make it bigger than Jai, despite his education here"
He's so fast!
Not even I can catch up with him.
He wants to outpace time
You'll know more once the principal has noted your attendance record
Do you know how many classes you attended this semester?
What a brilliant record!
You will see the principal at nine am tomorrow
Stop going around with that bunch.
"- I'll try to, sir"
Jags!
I'm dead!
Dad will kill me!
Why...?
Only you can do something!
We'll see tomorrow
Where are you going?
To class
College is gonna be so much fun!
Totes.
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.
"When you're burned, you've got nothing -- no cash, no credit, no job history."
You're stuck in whatever city they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?
- Miami.
You do whatever work comes your way.
You rely on anyone who's still talking to you.
A trigger-happy girlfriend...
Should we shoot them?
...an old friend who used to inform on you to the FBI...
You know spies -- a bunch of bitchy little girls.
"...family, too..."
"Hey, is that your mom again?"
...if you're desperate....
"Someone needs your help, Michael."
...and a down-and-out spy you met along the way.
"That's how we do it, people."
"Bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere."
Put the weapon down.
Hands on your head!
"Listen to me, Michael."
Gray shot your brother.
He murdered Nate.
"Michael, what happened?"
"Card's dead, Fi."
Now we need a way out of here.
So she's Alice.
"David,itis alwayssomething."
whynotme  like to leave with you.
Childrenfall.
Alice?
Why did not you wait presented to you?
Than?
They teach all days in the kids room not to talk to strangers.
Four years old.
How I am supposed to know who you are?
Do you have any idea how much It has taken me time to negotiate just see it unsupervised in a public space?
"- But David, fell off!"
"- Expected more from you, Alice."
I'm sorry...
Alice?
You lied about your name.
The Most swingers do.
"You have an STD, right?"
Do not.
"Worse, you're a journalist."
If you do not understand do you want to talk to me.
"Actually, it's time tell my story."
I have cancer.
Sinus and glands.
"If it removed, not would be nothing left of me."
I tried to get me this blow away.
Did you ever have children?
Good...
"You have to understand that it was the principle of the life of a woman, family planning ..."
Many of us did things that in retrospect ...
Abortion.
Adoption.
"Send a chopper, take a closer look."
Oh...
"Unfortunately, I don't have the resources."
What?
This operation was not officially sanctioned.
Excuse me?
London vetoed the mission.
They still think Crawford is in custody in Kenya...
"Which is where he would be, if everything had gone to plan."
(CHUCKLING) Oh...
I took a calculated risk.
- Fuck that.
Fuck you.
- We need the information on Latif.
"Yeah, yeah."
"In Latex, I know."
Should we save the recriminations till later?
Let's get you to safety.
Wait.
"In Dieter's file, it said that he was a chopper pilot."
"It's a long shot, but they might have had a bird out here..."
To extract Clare and Crawford after the exchange.
"How unfortunate that you killed him, then."
"(LAUGHING) Is it worth a hand job, if I didn't?"
GRANT:
"Hello, Dieter."
"I'm Colonel Grant, British Military Intelligence."
(GRUNTING) GRANT:
"Don't move, please, don't move."
"If I push this, an air bubble will go into your heart and kill you..."
GRANT:
It's a very nasty way to go.
- In the messenger center.
- Somebody was trying to send it...
- I've been looking all over for these.
"- I know, that's why..."
"- This is very serious, Jocelyn!"
I don't understand.
"Why you have these layouts... and why you're ""messengering"" them to someone."
"I wasn't the messenger, I was asked to return it."
- Someone left it there.
- Someone?
Maybe that someone is you.
And maybe you were planning... on sneaking them back into my drawer before you were discovered.
"- Sebastian, I'm not the Yuri."
- Interesting!
You're very defensive.
- I can't believe this!
- But I'll believe it... until you come up with another Yuri.
I'll keep my eye on you.
Watch your back... jag.
Over here...
- Over here.
- Where?
Over here.
I told you to never contact me again.
It's an emergency.
You helped me with Manolo's and I really need your help now...
This is different.
This goes deeper.
- How deep?
"- Fucking motherfucker... cock-sucker, fuck..."
sorry.
- It's my Tourett syndrome again.
My name is Jean.
Jean Jacquemonde.
Where is Mayzel?
!
You want to pick on an old man?
I'm here.
I've got you.
My body became like this because of you.
Ominae!
Jean?
Don't move!
brainwashing him with all the troubles of life your abilities are still only this much.
I'm going to stop the source of your breathing now...
Ominae!
...with this machine body of mine!
You've finally shown your true colors!
That is ENOUGH!
He's already dead.
Both Little Boy and Fatman failed to obtain Mayzel.
They were just big talk.
It was predictable.
that was all they could do.
what if they continue to hold Noah?
Don't worry about that.
When our satellite probe was destroyed the investigation into the magnetic field occurrence was quite significant.
along with the other message plate prove that we are the ones who are holding the key to Noah.
What great confidence.
I will kill all who interfere with me.
quietly.
You seem to be tired.
Who was he?
My former boss.
"For Claytor, everyday is part of a grand-if solitary-adventure."
He's been away form home for nearly three years and it could be three more before he returns.
"From Africa, he will head east to the four remaining continents between him a home."
Claytor has grown accustomed to being a stranger everywhere he goes
but he is also changed by every place he visits and every person he meets.
"I think there's a part of me that's become a little bit African, because the Africans have a saying which is when you ask them when they'll come back or what time something will be ready they'll smile and look at you"
and say anytime from now.
So when people ask me when I' going to get home sometimes I just can only say anytime from now.
"Look, right there."
A chamber.
Okay.
I see it.
Go on.
Get off my foot.
"Oh, will you--?"
Go on.
Do you see anything?
Spiders.
"Now get moving, MacGyver."
"Get moving, don't dawdle."
All right.
Look.
Huh?
There.
A sigma.
Ah.
"Do you recall your Greek, MacGyver?"
Sigma is the letter...
S. Yes.
As in Solon.
It says
Which together with your brothers missile trade with cocaine?
Coca push to make the road and the money washed them to become construction materials for guinea pigs.
"And that hog André the Secretary,"
"Simon and Venini in there, where?"
Simon is untouchable!
It is not the flow from dirty sewer rats!
Of sewer rats?
This I brings to mind a bath.
There is a pool here?
The joint construction passing through the Bank of Polo Red ...
Spring bank and give me the banker!
What does the banker well as the banker to do?
Go to the Bois with the German dachshund?
Medium rare?
Al dente?
At the point right?
Overcooked?
The theater has been put baldracca with an actress.
You could tell us what is your name?
"Aglaé, gia, gia!"
This information you saved my skin.
"Unfortunately for you, Marie gave you goodnight."
- Can I do anything for you?
- Noo ...
Why do you show this?
Because you are my friend!
You know what I want?
You know what I feel?
Just now I was about to tell you I have a conviction.
Servant to someone?
A nothing.
Sprofondo.
I believe it is.
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(LAUGHING)
"Because you don't have the facts, sir."
(CHUCKLING)
Wait a minute.
You're gonna love it.
Let's see what we got here.
All right.
I don't know why you started laughing.
Here.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
"Good afternoon, Lieutenant Lucerne."
I suppose you came here for a confession.
"Well, you're not going to get it, sir."
(WARD LAUGHING)
"I'm just silly, sir, but that machine, that is really fantastic."
"How much, roughly, would a thing like that cost?"
"Oh, about $3,000."
"Not counting the camera, of course."
Three thousand?
Dollars?
"Why, I can get a new car for that."
Not that I need one.
"Lieutenant, you have something to say to me, don't you?"
"Yes, sir."
"I'm really sorry to bother you like this, sir."
But just a couple of questions before my report on Sid Daley.
"It doesn't look like he could have done it, sir."
He was with a girl and she confirmed it.
But the reason I was chosen to do that operation is that I can read.
"One might even say that I'm the pick of the ""litterate."""
"Evening, laddies."
Say howdy to Sergeant Vickers.
He's our friendly neighborhood retention officer.
Too bad he didn't come to a friendly neighborhood.
No offense.
We just don't like war-to-war salesmen.
Hey!
You're a great bunch of kidders.
I like a good joke myself.
"In that case, may I present Major Winchester?"
Major Winchester.
You must be a career man.
L... [Chortles]
[Chortling Continues]
Let me ask you something.
Doesn't it bother you to sweet-talk young kids... into risking their lives all over again?
"- Hey, I'm just offering a little free advice."
- Like how to avoid old age.
Ah.
Nothing I like better than the free exchange of ideas.
That's Sergeant Hutchinson over there.
He's on that short-timers list of yours.
"Oh, yes."
Excuse me.
Enjoyed shooting' the breeze.
- Oh.
Wait a minute.
"- Let the man be, Pierce."
We all got our little tasks in life.
"- Incidentally, there's a meeting in my office tomorrow at 0900."
We have got hundreds...
"As you can see, the military's moving into position but won't advance because of safety concerns for the hostages."
"--Obvious to everyone, this is the work of al Qaeda or some like-minded Arab terrorist group."
- The National Guard...
- The building's buttoned up.
Rooftop's secure.
- They attempted contact yet?
- Not yet.
"- Apparently, we're all Arabs."
- Good.
- Cake?
"- No, I don't want cake."
I'm diabetic.
Hallelujah.
This is my Graceland!
Sweet Shiva.
Sugary pops of delight.
"Come on, let's go!"
Move!
"Let's go, sheeple."
"Now, welcome to my house."
"Now, sit down and shut up!"
"Oh, baby, I've missed you."
Let's get you plugged in.
You fit in nicely right there.
"Ladies and gentlemen, Skip Tyler has arrived."
"By the time you're watching this, I will have pulled off the greatest hack the world has ever seen."
"This is difficult for some, it is but for me, it's as easy as one, two, three four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
Yes.
Showtime!
"Oh, some latecomers."
Secretary of Homeland Security is in the house!
Your Picassos and Bacons and those fellas who paint your ceilings.
I know those guys.
Doughnut economics!
50/50!
"The cake for you, the hole for everybody else!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, hello!"
The Middle East!
Flat-packed atomic bombs!
Nerve gas!
"School-kid soldiers minced in the swamps, between Iran and the other one!"
Our export figures look so good in the National Assembly reports!
And I being a zero!
"- No, the other one."
- Sorry.
- So what now?
Go straight to the hilt?
Right.
I'm doing this by the numbers!
"The price of the Queen, like in Shake-a-spear."
"You must have ran into a book, now that you're no longer working the streets."
Nobody surrenders a Queen.
"You have to take her, you buy her, you have to deserve her."
"Come on, all together!"
"""O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree,"
"""How are thy leaves so verdant!"""
Were you talking about me?
My love.
But I'm worthless!
My Queen!
"Excuse my lateness, I was drowning in Ministry paperwork!"
And what the fuck are you doing here?
"And what about you, you, you!"
Won't you send me off with a kiss?
- Here?
!
No.
Here.
Bye.
Deepa.
Say hello to my father-in-law!
Severe head injury.
But now he is alright.
Since he is under heavy medications
It may take a few days for him to gain consciousness.
Let him stay in the hospital till then.
He will recover soon.
"Thanks, doctor."
At what age did your son lose his eyesight?
When he was 15.
All of a sudden he had a high fever.
It continued for 2 weeks.
He started losing his vision slowly.
Doctors diagnosed him with...
"Retinitis pigmentosa, a degenerative eye disease."
But none of those treatments helped.
We checked his eyes now
His retina is responding to light.
The ophthalmologist will be visiting tomorrow.
Let's see what he has to say.
Varun has light perception.
Surgery may help him get his vision back.
So...
"- There's nothing to think about, doctor."
If Varun can get his sight back...
"Well, we must play to our strengths, must not overreach ourselves."
- Right.
- Er...
How does 12 boiled eggs sound?
"Er, usually like this..."
"Nice gag, Eddie, and totally unexpected."
"Perhaps a little sophisticated for BBC2, though."
I can just see it now.
"""How's the golf going, Tarbs?"""
"""Oh, really?"""
"""Do you wanna hear a stupid joke about an Irishman being stupid?"""
- Can't wait.
"- What do you suggest, then?"
"You're supposed to be my friend, you freeloading parasite."
Smelly Eddie to the rescue.
"When I was watching TV-am in the lav this morning,"
I saw this fantast ad for a new mag called Poncy Cooking.
"And when you buy part one, you get part two completely free."
That sounds like a marvellous offer and one not to be missed.
"Actually, it's a clumsy setup for a gag later on."
"- Oh, what a shame."
- Yes.
- Let's go to the newsagent's.
"- Okey-dokey, diddly squat."
Over we go.
Don't ever say I'm not there when I'm not needed.
You're not there when you're not needed.
Thank you.
"- Ready, Eddie?"
- Ready-weddy.
- Let's go.
"- Right, then."
"You two,"
"How graceful, it is the first time that you attend an operation?"
"Yes, Doctor."
Well.
In first row.
"And that nobody dares to faint itself when begins to sprinkle the blood, or some other organic liquid."
Far from it that it is happened to you to vomit.
-The others can remain back.
"-Thanks, Doctor."
Wash the hands.
I do not want to impure people in the operating room.
What?
"Good morning, Professor."
Everything is to point for the operation.
Well.
These must be the novices.
"You have explained to them that if they must faint, they do that backwards?"
"Because when I operate, short what it is put to me ahead."
They have been warned already.
"Italia, the towel."
Firm.
Moroni.?
Again here?
How he is that?
"Professor, to attend to an operation hers it is like attending a concert of Rubinstein."
Slight ball.
"Cicchirini, you have found to which it surpasses to you."
"Well, we are going to operate."
We go.
You.
"Here, here and here."
"Quickly, we go."
It's all in there.
I don't know what to say.
"That it, then?"
Yeah.
WALDRON:
So many years I wondered what I'd do if I ever saw him again.
And then I did.
"In a photo, in a briefing room."
And I was being sent to meet him with a gun.
ARNOTT.
I don't think we should close the investigation into Danny Waldron's background.
I'd like to keep digging.
(Mumbles)
What's he saying?
"This is a young Ronan Murphy, shot by Danny Waldron during Operation Damson."
What'?
They knew each other?
Did you fabricate the improper relations
- between you and DS Arnott'?
- No.
Did you fabricate the planting of evidence against you'?
- What is your verdict?
- Not guilty.
It is with deep regret that I inform you all of the death of PC Rod Kennedy.
Hari initiated the struggle with that gun and it's only his word for it that it was self-defence.
I owe you an apology for the other night.
Your...dinner invitation.
You're a married man.
This is it.
Danny Waldron purposefully created a trail of evidence.
And now we're on the trail of the other abusers.
"Can I help you?"""
"That means, ""Please don't rob me."""
And the guy will be the nicest dude ever.
"He's like, ""Well, actually, my name's Jamal."""
"""I just graduated from Harvard,"
"""and I can't wait to start the IT program, 'cause I really feel I can be a valuable asset to the team."""
"""Okay, Jamal."
"""Well, I'm gonna go call up Karen and see if she knows anything about this."""
There's always a Karen.
"Oh, I'm sorry, I was in the middle of a bit."
Hold up.
"""Hey!"""
How you gonna control a child named Blue Ivy?
"She's sitting there pitching a fit, and Jay-Z looking all helpless."
He just...
"""Oh, oh."
"""Yo."
"""Hey, yo, Blue, you really need to calm down, you know?"
"""'Cause I'm really starting to get irritated, you know?"
"Jeah."""
¶ All I'm saying is I'm your daddy ¶
¶ You my little baby goi-rl.
"""Jeah."""
¶ But you don't want me to go and get that belt ¶
¶ 'Cause if I do both of your ass cheeks will melt ¶
"""Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."""
"Shoot, Blue Ivy gonna look her dad dead in the face and be just like this here."
"""Do you hear what you named me?"
"Fuck you, Shawn."""
"""And since you wanna name me weird stuff,"
"""I'm gonna go sleep with Chris Brown and R. Kelly."
"How you like that?"""
- 0h.
- (Laughing)
- You know the purse I bought in Paris?
- Yeah.
Bill Edward's tonsils.
(Hank) Mommy!
Daddy!
"Daddy, come with us!"
We're gonna see the medicine man.
"- Maybe you can learn something, Daddy."
- l wouldn't be surprised.
Anytime he starts wearing you out - l haven't enjoyed the market so much.
- l never thought of it that way before.
- What?
I'm wearing Johnny Matthews' appendix.
What about the boat trip?
"It took two boys, one girl, and two sets of twins, didn't it?"
And Mrs Morgan's hives.
(Laughing)
- How are the acrobats today?
- Wonderful.
Watch that kid that goes clear to the top there.
- l'll see you later.
- Yes.
All the way home we'll be riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.
And Allida Markle's asthma.
Now if we could just get four cases of seven-year-itch we could retire.
"0r if Mrs Yarrow's really gonna have triplets, we could completely redecorate the house."
What would they say if they heard us?
0ne of the reasons I came to a place like Marakesh is so we could say things like that without everybody hearing us.
I'd like to say something where nobody could hear us.
This is the safest place.
Don't believe her.
Your mom is a little crazy.
But we all love her.
Right?
- Shiv.
- Okay?
"Yes, baby!"
Don't believe her.
Let's go.
"""No, no, no, no."""
"""No, no, no, no."""
"""Separating the world from myself..."""
"""I'll hug you and keep you with me forever."""

"""I wanna say to you, that I want to live with you, oh beautiful."""

"Inaho insists that she is an imposter, but there's no telling just how much he can see."
Have you eaten?
In a bit.
Let me find a good place to leave off.
You've been this way since we were little.
"When you're into something, everything else fades away."
Here.
"Thanks, Yuki."
"You've heard, right?"
"About Asseylum's, uh..."
Yeah.
That proclamation seemed to prove everything you've been saying.
"It all seems a little too convenient, and if that really were the genuine Princess Asseylum, would she think of a founding a kingdom in Earthspace?"
Slaine Troyard.
That douchebag who shot my dear little brother?
Thanks.
"But watch your language, Yuki."
It doesn't matter if she's real or not anymore.
I don't think anyone would bother to listen to her.
Even if she tried to broker a peace between Earth and Mars again.
"About the attack on Earth, Milord, if there are no problems, I will get preparations underway."
Milord Slaine?
I'm listening.
Proceed as planned.
"Yes, Milord."
Her Highness has yet to-.
She will wake up soon.
I know it.
"I eagerly await that day, Milord."
But... tragedies do happen.
Milord?
It's nothing.
"Thank you, friend."
"- Thank you, my boy."
-(chuckles)
- A toast.
-Thank you.
"It just goes to prove, what I've always said, every dog has his day."
Thank you very much.
"Morning, Mr. Marshall."
"Hello, Kramden."
What can I do for you?
"Mr. Marshall, I have a million dollars in here."
Then you must have had a mighty good day on the bus.
Oh-ho!
"Ha, ha, ha!"
Very good!
(chuckles) Very good!
"Well, it's like the men say, Mr. Marshall, you're a good guy."
All the fellas say the same thing:
"they say you're a guy that likes new ideas and a fella that you can come to and get advice, sometimes even financial assistance. (chuckles)"
"Mr. Marshall, I have here a fortune."
"My wife made a whole bowl of this last night, and I scooped some up to bring it over as a sample."
And there it is.
What is it?
An appetizer.
The most delicious you've ever tasted in your life!
- Appetizer?
"-Sure, an appetizer."
People go nuts over appetizers.
"Walk into any supermarket-- all along the shelves, they got jars of appetizers."
But the difference is that this is something new and different.
"That's what the people go for, something new and different."
This is delicious.
They've all had incredible training.
"It was intimidating at first, but I know I'm in good company."
I'm learning about composers I never knew-
"Amanda's heart was beating rapidly, and she was speaking really fast."
"She seemed happy, but I could sense that she was troubled."
I'm already a better technical player.
Amanda... is everything all right?
I can never hide anything from you.
But I need to let my mom know I'm home.
Can we get together later?
Of course.
Good.
I guess we need to talk.
She said what?
"""We need to talk. """
What is it?
Nothing.
"No, I missed something."
"Well, when someone says, ""We need to talk,"""
sometimes it's a lead in to a discussion about feelings that have changed.
Feelings?
"Prepare yourself, dude."
She's dumping you.
At least she has the decency to do it in person.
Don't read into it.
Just wait and hear what she has to say.
No.
Not my lucky shirt.
"Josh, you've outgrown it."
I couldn't help but wonder...
Had Amanda already outgrown me?
"Okay, grab hold of the wire and make these babies blink."
"He's had a poor first impression of me, I fear."
"Before I meet him again, I want him to be convinced of my complete sincerity."
well?
What do you think?
"Look, you know him."
How will he respond?
I can't imagine any man resisting this prose.
It would melt the alps.
"But tell me, why do you pounce on our poor Chopin?"
"My dear, he's got one foot in the grave."
"No, no."
We shall all be in our graves soon enough.
But Chopin is eternal.
The only permanent thing about him is his cough.
(Duke) Ah.
- AII right.
"- Thank you, my friend."
"Madame Sand, will you delight us with your company on a hunt?"
"I must decline, Your excellency."
My maid is fitting me for a dress this afternoon.
A dress?
(piano transcription of Beethoven's Sixth continues)
(laughter and absorbed chatter)
- Quick!
- (fiinaI chord)
Perfect!
marvellous.
"darling, George proposes a game of croquet."
excellent idea.
Chopin will join us.
"Oh, no."
please excuse me.
"Well, let's call him in for the notification."
You haven't cut yet?
"You ever defrost a chicken, Agent Kelton?"
It takes time.
Your decident Amanda McNeil has minimal freezer burn.
Best guess:
She was kept in an airtight industrial refrigerator.
Any idea of cause of death?
I can't say for sure until I cut.
"Given the petechial hemorrhages, she probably died of asphyxiation."
"No ligature marks-- so, maybe drowning."
What about time of death?
Gray at the roots.
A little over an inch.
Average growth is half an-inch a month.
So she was alive about two months after her last visit to the hairdresser.
That was the day before she disappeared.
Two months.
That's plenty of time to party.
"Hey, Joe."
Take it easy there.
"- Sorry, Cap."
- Bucket up.
Hey!
You're eating my sandwich.
"Well, finders keepers, right?"
I was hungry.
"You're not from around here, are you?"
Nope.
"Well, enjoy."
I'm looking for a job.
"At Monty's bar, they're looking for a waitress."
"Love comes, love goes"
NO BEGGING OR MUSIC PLAYING ALLOWED
It wafts in on the breeze and then it's gone
No one makes a big fuss over love these days
You get along or you slug it out
A day is like a year...
"Miss, take some change out of my pocket."
I can't reach my piggy bank.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can forbid it
Put the rest back now.
A brunette tomorrow
Who wants to commit his heart
"See, I didn't steal any."
Then reach in again.
Your fiancé isn't as old as he looks either.
What's going on here?
Good thing that sign says you're blind or no one would know.
Mind your own business.
I'm just doing my job.
Better guide your music director back to his chair.
Meet me at 5:00 at the fountain in Friedrichshain Park.
"Love comes, love goes"
No government can do anything about it
So here we are.
"Yes, here we are."
So you think we should be organ grinders?
Were you in the war?
And how!
- What's your name?
- Me?
"Biberkopf, Franz."
But...
What?
Seems like he doesn't like you
Who is your Master?
Shi Zhengzong.
Have you heard about him?
He was nicknamed Thunderstorm
He has good technique and holds high acclaim
Thunderstorm?
Think I lied to you?
If he has good technique n' all that... how did I break his bones three years ago?
You've beaten him up?
I despise these hypocrites who call themselves
The decent school of martial arts
All they know is vanity!
"Don't worry, I won't beat you up"
Because we are good brothers!
Of course!
"Brother Jin, are you okay?"
T omorrow get me some medicine Tianqi and Baiyao
1 0 grams of Tianqi and 50 grams of Baiyao
Please get it from somewhere else!
Why?
I've got money?
Get it quick!
"Tianqi, Baiyao"
Do you need them for cuts?
"Hey, don't you want to do business?"
What are you doing?
"T ell me quick, do you need them for cuts?"
It's not your concern
I'll cut your head off if you don't tell me!
Cardoza photographed it...
But it never showed up in the evidence locker.
Why not?
Paper says it went missing.
"Initials ""a.T."""
Jury tv had gavel-to-gavel coverage of the whole trial.
Uh...
Yeah.
This is from the day enright's lawyer grilled jesse.
"Attorney Ah, detective cardoza..."
"Now, you took the photograph"
"Of this bloody cuff link at the murder scene, correct?"
"Yes, I did."
Ah.
"And would you please read out for the court,"
"Uh, the initials that are engraved on that cuff link?"
"""a.T."""
"Well, those don't appear to be"
"The initials of my client, tony enright, now, do they?"
Was that a yes or a no?
No.
No.
Thank you.
"Um, there-there appears to be"
Blood on this cuff link.
"Now, will you tell us, please, is that the victim's blood"
Or the perpetrator?
I don't know.
"I'm so sorry, I'm..."
Going a little deaf in this ear.
"Could you, uh, repeat that a bit louder?"
I don't know.
Wow!
"I couldn't help wondering why, with all the money that Ward Fowler makes, he could owe Claire Daley that much."
And then it hit me.
"What hit you, sir?"
Coffee?
Thank you.
Did you happen to see a show last August that had to do with a man who was being blackmailed by a woman?
"Oh, yes, sir, I did see that show."
Yes.
He shot her.
Exactly.
Why would Claire Daley blackmail Ward Fowler?
And then how?
"That's where I'm gonna need your help, Lieutenant."
"Have you, by any chance, checked with the Toronto police by now?"
"Yes, yes, as a matter of fact, I have."
I thought maybe you had.
And they told you...
They told me that Charles Kipling was an alias.
And that's when you decided to have
Ward Fowler's fingerprints checked with the FBI?
"That is absolutely right, sir."
You're amazing.
"Yes, it turns out that Ward Fowler's real name is not Charles Kipling."
It's John Snelling and you're a...
He's not a Canadian.
He's an American.
And he went to Canada after he deserted during the Korean War.
There you are.
There's your motive.
How would it look if America's favorite detective were known to be a Korean War deserter?
Or hadrt that occurred to you?
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.
"You like rooftops overwindows... you like angles with the target on your right-hand side, 'causeyou're left-handed."
That's right.
I knew I liked you.
Put it on.
"[ Scoffs ] Michael... is this whatyou reallywant, huh?"
Helping out civilians with their little problems... trying to get your governmentjob back?
It's pathetic.
- You're better than that.
- [ Clicks ]
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.
I gotta turn you in.
There'll be questions.
It'll be past lunch before we're done.
[ Chuckles ] Turn me in?
"A lot of secrets, a lot of enemies."
"Think it'd be a short stay, don'tyou?"
"Now, don'tyou think we could come to some arrangement?"
- I don't think so.
- Now be honest with me.
If circumstances were different... do you think that we could--
Not in this lifetime.
Perhaps the next one.
- [ Crash ] - [ Woman Screams ]
[ People Screaming]
- Indictments came down yesterday.
- That was quick.
They found the leak in the U.S. Attorney's office... and Evelyn-- wow.
They're gonna be workin' up her file foryears.
"She was a very, very bad girl."
I managed to keep you out of it so far.
-Quit!
Well?
want to indicate you to me where is the vesicle?
Ah... here.
"Either, or."
What cuts you would do?
From here up to here.
Thus?
And how I am going to be able to rummage about with the hand?
"What happens, idiot?"
You have something to say?
Want to operate you?
"No, no, Professor, was enjoying... with its words."
It is not hour to enjoy.
You do sexual activity that I want to begin to operate.
"Hurry up, to put to sleep"
If they do not extinguish the light there is no form to sleep to me.
It pardons?
Dr. Ciotti are you?
-Why?
It is not evident?
"-Yes, it is, only that I am afraid that I have been mistaken of operating room."
What means?
"In fact, I have come by the hemorroides."
Hemorroides?
Hemorroides.
"Cicchirini, between the vesicle and the hemorroides, there is much route."
We suspend during half an hour.
"Prepare, therefore I will do a new back tuna to him."
A tuna new ass?
"Why, the old man is broken?"
"They are misfortunes that happen, why to your sister."
There's a toilet.
The pillow actually looks pretty comfortable.
OK.
"You don't speak to me, ever."
- Ever.
- OK.
- No!
Shut up!
- OK.
So what are you guys in here for?
For giving the United States a taste of their own medicine.
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.
Others call us heroes.
Screw that.
You think you guys are heroes for killing innocent people?
It's 'cause of assholes like you that we're even in this fucking place... you fucking cowards!
"Well, maybe if the people in your country stopped eating donuts... and started realizing what your government is doing to the world... assholes like us wouldn't exist."
- Fuck you!
Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.
You like donuts?
"Well, wait till you see what they make you eat in here."
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?
l--
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?
What's a cockmeat sandwich?
You're about to find out.
Right about now.
Suckers.
"All right, cockmeat sandwich time."
"Inspector Li, the suspect Eddie Hung held a hostage... in a crowded trolley car..."
Could you see him clearly?
- Could you?
- Yes.
- Why did you shoot?
- Instinct.
Did you consider the safety of the passengers?
Did you sound any warning before you shot?
Insufficient time.
The hostage had a coronary thrombosis.
She died of a heart attack.
Her family has registered an official complaint.
- You're responsible for her death.
- That's crazy
How could I know she had a heart condition?
I've been on Eddie Hung's case for seven months.
The guy was a maniac.
He'd shoot anybody for any reason.
Should I have waited until he killed her?
You forget I'd just seen him kill a cop.
Who's responsible for that cop's death?
Fine!
Do whateveryou want.
I'm used to all sorts ofcomplaints.
One more makes no difference.
Catch!
- How's the action hand?
- Pretty useless.
Better use it more.
It won't help.
A one-handed killer's out ofthe action.
I've had my day.
"There's bigger things happening in the world... than your stupid actor clients, and the Nielsen ratings on the TV."
You're now officially embarrassing everybody here.
Ok?
"Don't you... dare ""F""ing tell me that I'm embarrassing you, ok?"
Because...
my friends think you're a douchebag.
A... nasty ass... sleazebag agent.
"Drew, we don't think you're a douchebag."
"Jill, come on."
That's ok.
Thanks.
"Oh, where you gonna go?"
Are you gonna go home and masturbate?
To one of your anime porns?
Cartoons.
He made me watch animated porn.
Yeah.
I'm gonna go home and masturbate!
Disgusting.
Because it's better than anything you're giving me at home.
"No, 'cause you love to masturbate."
"'Cause for you, it's like having sex with something that you love!"
Yourself!
Did she just make that up?
Annie Hall. '77.
I'm going home!
Are you gonna go screw one of your actresses?
"One of your stupid, slutty..."
sleep your way to the top actresses.
I think I need to go to the bathroom.
Somebody can take her home.
'Cause now she's drunk and you're pissed off.
Help!
Fredo!
"-I can't control her, Mikey."
"-You're my brother, don't apologize."
Clemenza promised the Rosato brothers three territories after he died.
You took over and didn't give it to them.
I welched.
Clemenza promised them lu cazzo.
He promised them nothing.
-He hated them more than I do.
"-Frankie, they feel cheated."
You're sitting up in the Sierra Mountains and you're drinking...
-What's he drinking?
-Champagne.
"Champagne cocktails, and passing judgment on how I run my family."
Your family's still called Corleone.
And you'll run it like a Corleone.
"My family doesn't eat here, doesn't eat in Las Vegas and doesn't eat in Miami with Hyman Roth!"
You're a good old man and I like you.
You were loyal to my father for years.
The Rosato brothers are taking hostages.
"They spit right in my face, all because they're backed up by that Jew in Miami."
I know.
That's why I don't want them touched.
-Not touched?
"-No, I want you to be fair with them."
You want me to be fair with them?
How can you be fair to animals?
"Tom, listen."
"They recruit spics, they recruit niggers."
They do violence in their grandmothers' neighborhoods!
And everything with them is whores!
"-Good evening, Mrs. Bourne."
"Horace, you're looking very handsome tonight."
And so are you.
"-My, that's a beautiful gown."
-Brandon chose it.
"They're always much gayer when Brandon chooses them, Jessie."
"Nora Kernan, Horace and I don't come here every Thursday night just to talk women talk."
Suppose we discuss dinner for awhile?
"Oh, Brandon, before I forget, Frank Belney called a few minutes ago."
He wants you to meet him at your club at 10:00.
"-Oh, no."
"-I'm sorry, Jess."
Frank's meeting his stockholders tomorrow.
He must be getting nervous.
Could you answer one simple question just to cheer me up?
Yes.
We are having corned beef and cabbage.
-Dinner is served.
-On the dot.
Check.
"Dear, I don't know if it's possible, but I feel that you're cheating."
"When you can prove it, I'll be glad to discuss it with you."
Jessie looks wonderful tonight.
"She has you to thank for her looks, darling."
And you.
"When a woman gets more beautiful after she's married, it means her man is either making her very happy, or very unhappy."
-Oscar Wilde?
"-No, Belasco."
"Horace, you're really very good with that one step of yours."
You do so much with it.
"Well, I've been polishing it for 40 years."
"Nora, remember when you taught me to dance, backstage at the New Amsterdam?"
Step by step.
There's still lots of work.
I don't understand why our artistic director is walking like a peacock after everything they wrote in the paper.
What did they write?
"Sherlock, my friend, where are we going and what happened?"
She can stand in for me anytime.
What article?
It's been a month since I read the paper.

What did it say?
They're doing an investigative report about financial irregularities.
We have to get rid of our artistic director.
It's not that simple.
"Submit your candidacy, they'll back you."
You submit your candidacy.
"Do me a favor, get serious."

"The more the merrier, my friend, it's quite elementary"
Sergio Leone died yesterday.
Is that so?
What a shame.
He was young.
"Who is it, Liyova?"
A friend of yours?
"No, Mama, he's a great director."
"An incredible director, eh, Yitzhak?"
A Fistful of Rings.
- A Fistful of Dollars.
"Dollars, yes."

"Well done, Papa."
He's also a man and that...

But the important thing for you to understand...
... isthatIamnottryingto replace your mother.
"In fact, no one can replace your mother."
I bet you could kill a guy with a piece of bacon.
"All right, then."
I'm glad we had this talk.
I'm gonna go post my plan on the Internet.
"You know, there's moments around here..."
... thatmakeme wish I had a son of my own.
That wasn't one of them.
"Yeah, well."
"Anyway, I really appreciate you watching him tonight."
No problem.
-How you getting to the restaurant?
-Sherri's picking me up.
-Very convenient.
-Why?
Because she's been here before?
Been here with you?
Because you've had sex with her in every room in the house?
"No, because you can't drive."
But it's interesting to see how your mind works.
"Alan, let me give you some advice."
Alcohol impairs your ability to make good decisions.
We don't want you to lose that ability.
We want her to.
Of course.
Very good.
"That day, we went around the town of Nagasaki...  because we wanted to know a lot more about the atomic bomb."
"Even though the atomic bomb was dropped, this survived?"
"No, it was rebuilt."
But there are some things left just as they were at that time.
The angels all look as if they are crying.
The atomic bomb blasted right above here.
Portugal.
These are monuments... sent from different countries of the world.
Czechoslovakia.
Italy.
Poland.
Bulgaria.
The Soviet Union.
China.
Brazil.
Cuba.
Holland.
I can't find the one from America.
What do you expect?
America is the one that dropped the atomic bomb.
"""I was so very thirsty."
"""Water, water. "" All died uttering that word."
"But nowadays, for most of the people... the atomic bomb is something that happened once upon a time."
People are apt to forget... even a dreadful event like that... as the years pass by.
Can we leave it like that?
I really pity Grandpa and Grandma.
Want some ice cream?
Grandma.
Grandma.
You're late!
What have you been doing?
"It's all right, now, all right."
"Listen, Dalton, what do ya have on this?"
"I just got here, Judy."
I don't know...
Give me a break.
"Come on, Dalton..."
You're here.
"It's gotta mean one thing, the exterminator."
"The first one was johnathon minor, age 37, male Caucasian."
"Forty-two arrests for promoting prostitution, assault, rape, white slavery, corrupting the morals of minors."
Lately he specialized in young boys.
He was convicted twice and served a total of 18 months.
"Jesus, it looks like he got hit by napalm."
Most of that's from the burning mattress.
The fireman says it's like that every time someone falls asleep smoking.
Step this way...
I'll show you our next attraction.
Jesus.
Who was he?
He was a state senator from new Jersey.
"Hey, Dalton?"
"Yes, Steve?"
I have the autopsy on the third ghetto ghoul and the print out that you ordered.
I also have a telephone message from the CIA.
- The c.I.A?
- Yeah.
An agent shore called.
"He wants a briefing on the ""the exterminator"" case."
He says he cleared it with the commissioner.
"Here, he left his number."
"- Thanks, Steve."
- All right.

Let's talk later
Why don't you use this car?
"I will, of course I will"
When?
All in good time
"Namaste, sir. (Greeting) How are you Ramprasad?"
To that usual everyday question I usually lie everyday
You lie?
About being fine
You aren't fine
How could I?
I want to become a singer
I took up the liftman's job here in hope that you'd notice me someday
I sing extremely well.
Would you like to hear...?
Not now.
Only in-between floors
"That was folk, but I can change it to rap"
Let's talk later
I told you.
Try to understand.
I'll try to put in a word
"Mr Om, why did you lodge a police complaint?"
He's a poor guy
Because you are a traitor who pirates my music
So what's wrong?
It's only business.
If I make a few cents pirating...
I can spare a bit for you too.
"Fast-forward your life, Mr Om"
Don't you ever step into this office.
"Peace Mr Om, peace"
He put you right in front of me.
It's true that Chief Jung tricked me.
Because he told me that this was all to protect you.
"Then, it's all over now."
Since we know... that we all tricked each other.
Then does that mean it's really over?
Nothing comes after that?
- Hello.
- Hello!
Min Ki!
Sit down for a second.
"Hey, we're sorry..."
about beating you up that time.
Your grandma must have been very shocked...
"Hey, we're good guys."
"The shadow told us not to look for you, so we never did."
- Why are you here?
- Min Ki.
"You're a good source of information in this neighborhood, right?"
- You're close with the police too.
- Who said that?
Earlier today...
Was someone stabbed with a knife?
Why... do you ask?
There is this crazy kid...
who is going around bragging about it.
"He said he really used his skills, or something like that..."
- At Chung Gye Plan?
- Yes?
A man was killed.
They said it looked like a spiteful relationship...
Because he was stabbed so many times.
"people come about 1 o'cIock, they're busy before that."
And before 4 pm nobody moves.
Robberies?
Everyone knows everyone here.
"With all these stairs, how could they everrob us?"
"It would take Tom Cruise from ""Mission:"
"impossible""."
You deny this area has a high crime rate?
You have no perception of reality!
We'II get a specialist to evaluate.
He was sent here orhe came by hisself?
"And anotherthing: when you speak, I don't understand you."
Speak to me in italian.
Were you sent here or did you come by yourself?
They sent me here to make you work.
Let's try to optimize the work.
I'm constipated.
You're pushing it.
Maria!
You could have come a little later!
"I can drive like a pro, too, taking curves with an ear on the ground."
finally Mr. VoIpe is here too.
Had to wash Mommy's dishes?
AII those courses...
Aren't you feeling well?
Why are you laughing?
Know what this man did?
"I invited him to my house, he locked himself in and hid his wallet, scared I'd steal it."
Don't force me to report you for discipline.
I'm shakin'.
You asked forit.
Didn't they teach you manners?

"Our mate Michael, the best-dressed Bolshevik in Newcastle."

I was sent to make contact with you.
"Oh, well, you certainly did that."
"In fact,"
"You made a lot more contact than i'm happy with,"
But there's no reason to go into it.

"All right, you got me."

Especially important is the warning to avoid conversations with the demon.
"We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous."
He's a liar.

He will lie to confuse us.
But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us.
"The attack is psychological, Damien."
And powerful.
So don't listen.
Remember that.

Looks like he's been dead a lot longer.

Anaphylactic shock?
From insect bites?
Anything could have triggered the allergic reaction.
"My cousin, if she even looks at a peanut?"
Blowfish.
"Well, these are insect bites, and that gets Lexia off the hook."
"Still, I mean that is one hell of a bee sting."
We need to go to the Underground and find out what Gene Hansen was doing before he died.

- Hello.
- Hey.
I got a case that's taking a tour through weirdsville.
- You care to join?
- I'm a little tied up at the moment.
I got a dead...

"Oh, all right, you don't have to explain yourself to me."
- I've got a life.
- I thought you were dead.
I'm busy.
- You're wearing that?
- You're wearing that?
"Okay, this is strictly a fact-finding mission,"

"Two hours, Madame."
"You do not have two hours, you have one!"

Go and find out at what time the King is expected to make his entry.
"Yes, Madame."
I had forgotten.
What?
How exquisite you are.

Did you hear the latest news about the Count De Valletta?
No.
A very sad affair.
"Despite several reminders from his creditors, he refused to pay his debt."
"The King was informed, sentenced him to 10 years in prison."

Margaret dropped from Connecticut.
She went to church every sunday.
This is when she was sixteen.
What are you doing?
"This is my hair, you could at least consult me about it."
"I think, Jane, the hairdresser..."

Hair stylist is right.
We don't need this accessory.
The image should be simple.
Your photographs that Adrian was just showing me indicate a fairly traditional upbringing.
And you slipped to a weird off with some obscure fantasy look.
spirit of paradise everyday in Las Vegas and better.
It's tacky.
You're tacky.
What do you mean by wearing all this weird make up and strange clothes?
Nothing.
You don't admit to dressing strange?
You're strange.
What do you mean by that?
I'm not wearing rags.
You're wearing what they want from you...baby.
America!
What do you mean America?
"I'm American, she's American."
He's American.
Where're you from?
-Detroit.
-Las Vegas.
-I'm coming from Montana.
You can stay as long as you like.
Based on true stories
"The police are searching for Robert Zeuthen's nine-year-old daughter, Emilie who disappeared earlier this evening from her home."
What are you doing to find her?
- Sarah Lund
- Who is this?
- The girl's all fight.
I'm collecting on a debt.
I have a suggestion - a life for a life.
"I'll get Zeuthen, you'll get the girl."
Emilie!
No!
The perpetrator listened to you.
You made him think twice.
- I saw him shoot her.
- Did you?
"Sarah Lund, Juncker and Borch have gone to Jutland."
The perpetrator may have spared Emilie.
He won't finish until he knows what happened back then.
- We don't know what happened.
- He shot her and threw her in the water.
- I can't feel it.
- And the investigation in Jutland?
We haven't found anything to show that your daughter is alive.
You could say that mourning is love without a home.
Don't!
"Let me out, damn it!"
I've decided to resign as Prime Minister.
The assistant public prosecutor had another meeting that day.
- I won't argue over Emilie's grave.
- They say she may still be alive.

It can't... be Zoravar.
It's someone else.

"Jeffrey, thankyou for sparing me."
We're in the same boat now.
There's no way out for us.
Don't let me see you again.
Inspector Li!
Five dead witnesses.
- It was him.
- Are you sure?
Show his picture.
Ask the neighbors if he was here.
Okay.
No regrets
No remorse
Let bygones be bygones
No signs of melancholy
No tears ofself-pity
I don't care about what's right or wrong
I'm not sentimental about the past
Just set me free from this reverie
For the pain lingers on
It dwells deep in my heart and soul
Only time will tell
Ifwe are meant for each other
My tears and laughter are my own indulgence
"Inspector, you hit the nail on the head."
The neighbors say he lives here.
Are you nuts?
Jenny!
"Jeffrey, is that you?"
Why don't you come back?
I'll be back this morning.

See if anyone who got that e-mail hails from Flushing.
Got ya.
Kyle Sheridan?
"Three count, buddy."
You lose.
High school wrestling team?
Four oer brothers.
Come on.
"Whoa, Coach Nelson."
What happened to his neck?
It was separated from his body.
And the rest of him was stuffed in garbage cans all over the city.
"Whoa, wait, you think I had something to do with this?"
We found sawdust on his torso.
"Sawdust from a tree indigenous to Flushing, Queens."
So?
"You're the only kid on the wrtling team who is from Flushing, Queens."
We found that same sawdust on Coach Nelson's roof.
"You were up there, weren't you with Todd Fleming?"
No.
"You leeched off his Wi-Fi signal, sent out the incriminating photos of the young boy."
"Right, when the coach found out about it, he came to you, and what'd you do?"
- What is it?
Sit down.
"Emily, I've been cheating."
Cheating?
Eating cheating?
"You know today, when you called the office, and Carol said I couldn't talk?"
- Yeah?
"- Well, I couldn't talk... because my mouth was full of chocolate-covered peanut brittle."
"Oh, Bob!"
"Emily, Let me finish."
The peanut brittle was just the dessert.
The appetizer was a liverwurst and Swiss cheese sandwich.
"- Oh, Bob."
How could you?
"- Emily, I'm still not finished."
Then I went down to the snack bar... and I snacked on almost every bar they had.
"Do you mean while I was stuffing radishes, you were stuffing your face?"
"Well, Emily."
I don't know what came over me.
"I just-The minute I walked in there, I wanted to attack anything edible."
I felt like...
Bela Lugosi in a room full of necks.
"Emily, hunger is a terrible thing, and I gave in to it."
And You know what's worse than all of that put together?
- What?
- I'm still hungry.
"Well, Bob, what do you want me to say?"
"I mean, eat whatever you want, stuff yourself like a pig?"
Start your diet next week or tomorrow or never?
"Well, It is my birthday."
Fine.
Why don't you eat your gifts?
You always seem to get what you want in the end.
The only thing I want in the world is you.
That's why-- why I texted Denise:
"because I want to be a part of your life,"
- all parts of your life.
- Uh-huh.
"Well, your methodology is disqualifying."
I'm so-
- I'm s--
I'm sorry--
You traumatized my daughter.
You traumatized me in the process.
We have no future together.
"If you never believe anything I say again, believe that."
Hey.
"If you care anything about what's left of your little family unit, you might want to tell your ex-husband to cry uncle because when I get done with him..."
It's just difficult to destroy dads without daughters becoming collateral damage.
"Sometimes ex-wives, too."
Fuck you.
Finally.
You get stuck in the stairwell?
Move.
Let's look at the arrest report.
[chatter]
Man:
Yeah.
I'm on it.
You did all this?
It's impressive.
I hope my daughters grow up to be this capable.
"You're a great lawyer, Lucy, with a great future."
But not everybody is cut out for trial work.
"You""re the one who will have to change."
"I don""t like it, but I work within the system."
"- Maybe you""re right."
"- Of course I""m right."
You need to spend less time with the kids and more time in the sack.
You smell good enough to eat.
"All that hot, warm syrup."
Cherries.
How could Mike not appreciate this body?
"L""d never get tired of this foot, knee... or this little spot right here."
I love you.
"I don""t know what I""m supposed to tell her."
Her own father left me.
"And the next two-faced liar I met, Bo... slept with my best friend when I was in the hospital."
"In the hospital, Lucas, having surgery on my right ovary."
Cassie knows this.
"She knows I found that slut""s library card sitting next to my birth control pills."
"Like Karen""s ever read a book in her life."
Cassie remembers how her mama struggled.
Remembers all four of us crammed in that stinky one-bedroom apartment.
- The one with the all them red ants.
- And that creepy neighbor.
He was a pervert.
Registered and everything.
I looked him up.
"L""m just trying to protect her."
"She""s my baby girl."
"Can I get some help over here, y""all?"
Hello?
"Miss Bacha, you""re gonna have to hold on."
"L""ve got a situation here."
"Why are you arguing with me, anyway?"
Been a long time.
Remember what we rehearsed.
"Make sure your ""Open, please come in"" signs are out."
You all know what to do.
"All right, nobody panics."
Here we go!
"Van, I just don't see any on-ramp anywhere."
"- Minny, I know exactly where we are."
"- Yeah, we're in the middle of nowhere."
"- Honey, please."
- Hello.
"Welcome to Radiator Springs, gateway to Ornament Valley."
Legendary for its service and hospitality.
How can we help you?
"- We don't need anything, thank you."
- Ask for directions to the Interstate.
There's no need to ask for directions.
I know where we're going.
He did the same thing on our trip to Shakopee.
"We were headed over there for the Crazy Days, and we..."
- OK.
Really.
"We're just peachy, OK?"
"- What you really need is the sweet taste of my homemade, organic fuel."
"No, it doesn't agree with my tank."
- Just trying to find the Interstate.
"- Good to see you, soldier!"
Come on by Sarge's Surplus Hut for your government surplus needs.
"- Honey, surplus!"
- We have too much surplus.
I do have a map over at the Cozy Cone Motel.
"And if you stay, we offer a free Lincoln Continental breakfast."
Very well done.
- No.
No.
Isabel!
- Roderick?
"- Please, no!"
- Roderick.
"Roderick, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
- After all the girls I brought through this place you owe me.
I want the Porter girl.
- One would wonder if you had her admitted to have your way with her.
- I've always loved that girl.
- Let's say we revisit the topic of Isabel Porter's future after tomorrow night's event.
- Hmm.
Fine.
How's the exposure?
Should be fine.
- I want her to hear it from you.
I fear she has too strong of a connection to my voice.
- I'm a surgeon.
- It's not a request.
- Fine.
You are Mary Bradbury.
You are awaiting trial for witchcraft and immorality of the highest order.
"Mary Bradbury, you are accused of crimes most heinous."
Admit that you are wrong and repent or you will be condemned to murder by hanging.
"But of course what interests me, my dear, is how an evolution in identity can manifest itself in the amygdala."
"But then again, a tree is still a tree, is it not?"
"- Mm, Gunther."
"- You need to eat, Mary."
- Please... help me.
But any more griping from ya and I'll put you out of your misery.
Understood?
"Oh, fresh water."
We should be heading farther inland.
"And if I wanted your opinion, captain taylor, I'd have asked for it."
"I'll have you hanged for this, moore."
Not if I put a hole through your skull first you won'T.
"Jacob, he's a valuable hostage."
Do you seriously propose to throw away an asset like the captain?
Take him back to the beach!
You're asking me?
If you're so pleased.
This way.
Mutineers.
"Friday, that's an english ship."
That means escape.
But it commandeered by mutineers.
What if the captain and his crew were reinstated?
"That is a very big ""if"" under these circumstances."
The crew is circled.
The captain is wounded and the mutineers are at least 25 strong.
What are those?
Where?
There.
Womenfolk.
Must be the captain's wife and daughter.
Your womenfolk are shaped like bells.
No wonder you went to sea.
Then we have to know that the captain would be on our side before we try anything.
Come on!
No stopping!
Push it!
could you describe your relationship?
"well, we,re very close."
"THEY,RE CLOSE."
"We,re different, but complementary."
Describe CIaudine.
"She,s sweet."
"She,s strong-wiIIed, knows her own mind, meticulous."
- How do you show that?
- For exampIe -
Hands up.
"At first, Jean-MicheI expected me to serve him."
It was always me who brought up breakfast.
"He,d never think to bring me breakfast."
- You lived in a house?
- A house?
"You said ,brought up breakfast.,"
"It,s just an expression."
We live in an apartment.
- I see.
- Very good.
What about politics?
What role does it play in your life?
politics?
"We,re neither left- nor right-wing."
NEITHER LEFT
- NOR RIGHT-WING
"We,re not activists, but we keep up with the news."
"Jean-MicheI and CIaudine, you know why you,re here."
"We,re designing an experimental Urban Center, and we want its inhabitants to feel comfortable."
"You,ve been chosen as typical users of the year 2000."
"We want to Iearn about your desires, your fears."
We want to measure your basic level of social integration.
-No need for gunplay here.
-l wouldn't be so sure.
YATES:
"This ain't your fight, mister."
-Who the hell are you?
-Name's Yates.
I'm a U.S. federal marshal.
Vin Tanner...
... you'reunderarrestfor murder in the sovereign state of Texas.
We've come to take you back.
Let's go.
"Marshal Yates, all I'm saying is that a man's actions should speak for him."
Couldn't agree more.
But I got papers say...
... thisfellowTanner'sactionsin Tascosa were that of a murderer.
Just because some papers say it doesn't make it true.
A lot of people will attest that Vin Tanner...
... hasriskedhislifemany times to protect this town.
"Mrs. Travis, I'm not the judge and I'm not the jury."
I'm not ever after that bounty on Tanner's head.
I'm just a lawman sworn to bring him to trial for the killing of Jess Kincaid.
"Good afternoon, ma'am."
"Marshal, you ever heard of a man by the name of Eli Joe?"
Should I?
He's wanted in Texas for the slaughter of two families.
"Well, what's that got to do with me?"
Tanner claims this Eli Joe set him up.
You know that for a fact?
Then what you have to say don't count for much.
MARY:
I'll wire the judge.
"You can do that, ma'am, but a territory judge..."
These stories don't have a long shelf life.
"If we don't give him more ammunition, this Silk will move on to somebody else."
- Then...
- Then what?
Daylight again?
- Definitely.
- Good.
And I could totally take that guy.
"You just worry too much, Nora."
You always have.
I know Sarah and Joe are going through a rough time.
Are you sure that's all?
I really think Tommy's decision to buy this winery with Holly is bothering her more than she's letting on.
Tommy and Sarah have a very strong bond.
William never would've brought Sarah to Ojai Foods if he thought she and Tommy couldn't survive sibling rivalry.
You're right.
You're right.
"I mean, look at us."
- What do you mean?
"- Our family wasn't exactly a picnic, yet here we are, after all these years, still speaking to one another."
- You want a green bean?
- Thank you.
"- It's a small miracle, isn't it?"
"- Yes, it is."
I don't know.
I think maybe I was wrong about her.
- About who?
- Holly.
- What do you mean?
- You're seeing her.
Tommy is starting a company with her.
"As much as I hate to admit it, maybe William was a good judge of character."
"Once he's got him, she's got all of little Stempington."
- Does the whole town know about this?
- No.
But those who do are too frightened to talk.
I haven't told you about The Wicker Barn.
"God's sake, get down, Joyce."
Ah!
"Oh, God, I'm sorry."
I'm pissing blood all over Margaret's new rug.
- It's Scotchgard protected.
"- Better answer that, Joyce."
"You might want to move the Panda, Joyce."
We've decided to issue a little warning.
"You could help us take her down, Joyce."
- How?
- We've never had anyone on the inside.
Think about it.
That's all I ask.
- You should go now.
(Pam) Welcome to Little Stempington.
"(Hilary) Hello, Joyce."
- ..someone I'm dying for you to meet.
"Joyce, at last."
"Hold this and press that little red button, would you, Joyce?"
You're the only suspect in that nasty little business back at The Wicker Barn.
(Hilary) I wouldn't want to be separated from my husband if he had buns like that.
"(Camilla) You don't want Jeremy's first day in the job to involve sending you to the click-clink for the next ten years, do you...do you...do you?"
- They made me do it.
"- Too late for excuses, Joyce."
"darling, please."
I'm afraid...
I'm gonna have to take you straight upstairs for questioning.
Quick debrief to discuss the coincidence of four ice villains attacking on the same day.
We shouldn't be long.
COMPUTER:
"Recognized Batman, zero two."
"Aquaman, zero six."
"Flash, zero four."
"Green Arrow, zero eight."
"Martian Manhunter, zero seven."
"Red Tornado, one six."
SPEEDY:
That's it?
"You promised us a real look inside, not a glorified backstage pass."
It's a first step.
You've been granted access few others get.
"Oh, really ?"
Who cares which side of the glass we're on?
"Roy, you just need to be patient."
What I need is respect.
They're treating us like kids.
"Worse, like sidekicks."
We deserve better than this.
"You're kidding, right?"
You're playing their game?
Why?
Today was supposed to be the day.
Step one in becoming full -fledged members of the League.
"Well, sure."
But I thought step one was a tour of the H.Q.
Except the Hall isn't the League's real H. Q.
I bet they never told you.
It's a false front for tourists and a pit stop for catching Zeta Beam teleporter tubes to the real thing an orbiting satellite called the Watchtower.
"I know, I know."
Hopefully not too much to interpret.
Slept well?
For the first time since I've been here.
Good.
"Until yesterday,"
I was not permitted regular prayer.
We receive comfort from our prayers.
- We?
- Human beings.
I say something wrong?
You placed us on the same level.
- Aren't we?
"- Well, here..."
I am thought of as less than human.
"And in your Jihad, I am."
Gideon... what do you really want from me?
I already told you.
I want to understand you.
And if that is not possible?
Then that would be my loss.
It's almost time for your midday prayers.
May I return later?
- I look forward to it.
- Thank you.
Most of these tips are so new they haven't even been authenticated yet.
"Yeah, but there's nothing in the established information that's remotely helpful."
Wait a minute.
Anthrax.
- What?
- Genimmune.
A dutch biotech firm reported that they may have had a security breach
- involving anthrax last week.
Police have arrested a man and charged him with the murders of five women in London.
"Gerald Wiggins, a railway ticket inspector, was apprehended at his home yesterday"
Inspector Lawley of Scotland Yard said that Wiggins appears to be mentally frail
Police believe they have found evidence linking him to all five murdered women.
The petrol and fuel oil shortages at home maybe worsening...
"That's it, isn't it?"
He's gone.
"Lucy, I'm so sorry."
It's not your fault.
Did he take anyone from the train?
Not that we know of.
No -one's been reported missing.
- The police must have scared him off.
- That's something.
That's a lot.
- That's a life you saved.
"- I know, but he's still out there."
We still don't know who he is.
"I do know who he is, actually."
(Clears her throat) He's Malcolm Crowley.
- You got a name from Cavendish?
- Who's Cavendish?
He headed up a classified department during the war.
He trained Crowley.
Jean found him.
So we have a name and whatever else is in there.
Bloody hell.
- How's your friend?
- Recovering.
- What happened to her?
- Harry beat her.
It's not the first time.
-Indiana...
"Yes, the museum will buy them, as usual, no questions asked."
"Yes, they are nice."
They're worth at least the price of a ticket to Marrakech.
"But the people I brought are important, and they're waiting."
What people?
Army Intelligence.
They knew you were coming before I did.
Seem to know everything.
They wouldn't tell me what they want.
"Well, what do I want to see them for?"
"What am I, in trouble?"
"Yes, Dr. Jones, we've heard a great deal about you."
Have you?
"Uh, professor of archaeology, expert on the occult, and, uh, how does one say it?"
Obtainer of rare antiquities.
That's one way of saying it.
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.
"-Oh, thank you."
-Thank you.
"Yes, you're a man of many talents."
"Now, you studied under Professor Ravenwood at the University of Chicago."
"Yes, I did."
You have no idea of his present whereabouts?
"Uh... well, just rumors, really."
"Somewhere in Asia, I think."
I haven't really spoken to him for ten years.
"We were friends, but, uh... had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid."
Mmm.
"Dr. Jones, now, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential, eh?"
I understand.
"I mean, if it's too complicated for you, and your kids and your divorce and your..."
And not to mention your presidential bid.
We can honestly just pretend that last night never happened.
"I mean, no."
Not that it wasn't memorable...
"I mean, it was."
It was...
"You know, it was great."
But...
"But if you don't think this will definitely work, you're probably right."
"Well, there's just one problem."
I like you.
Oh!
Great!
You like me.
"So, what does that mean?"
We get to hold hands at Cindy Burke's Roller Rink party?
"No, I was thinking maybe dinner."
Maybe sushi.
"I don't rent out entire restaurants, unlike some people."
"Oh, no."
He...
"Actually, he owns it."
My point being...
"People are gonna see us, Kitty."
And I want you to know that I won't be caring.
Previously on Brothers and Sisters:
You're gonna buy my interest in Ojai Foods.
Holly and I are going to take the proceeds from the sale of the stock and buy Greendale Winery.
Sex will replace my drug addiction with...
After rehab you're sworn to celibacy?
"Xiamu, since we were young until now, have I not been with you?"
"When you graduated, when you entered the university, also... when you get married, I'll be with you giving my blessings!"
"You will do the same to me, won't you?"
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you for the attendance!
Thanks a lot!
Good!

"Qu Weiran, the love child is finally legitimated!"
Love child?
"People from Haide Industry said, his father had an older son with his wife."
"The older son likes to exploration, and got himself killed in a snow mountain two years ago."
So Qu Weiran was naturally promoted to be a project manager.
Qu is such a lucky guy!
"Yes, he is."
"However, the point is..."
"Qu Weiran with his Bentley, is less adorable than our Zhang Jingwu with his broken car!"
- My car is fine!
- Pervert!
It was just a kiss!
Why did you scold me?
Don't you take it personally too quickly?
- I was referring to Qu Weiran.
- Oh...
He is a pervert!
Did you know?
He messed with and occupied woman before.
"So the woman's boyfriend went to his house, beat him up and broke few ribs of him!"
- Good!
- Really!
Don't worry!
Ministry of War Transport.
Seems they've had wind of your proposed filmic scenario.
"Apparently, they're concerned that ""the Nancy Starling's engine failure may cast morale-sapping doubt on the quality of British engineering."""

"Uncle Frank goes in the water to free it, gets shot, and the girls have to finish the job under fire."
- Not the girls.
- Not the girls?
- No.
"Uh, Johnnie."
- Johnnie?
- Is there an echo in here?
- Why him?
- Because he's the hero.
- So?
"Well, how do we know he's the hero if he never does anything heroic?"
"Well, he's called Johnnie."
"Are you trying to pick a fight with me, Mrs. Cole?"
Johnnie can't go in the water.
"He's injured, badly injured."
"A manly slash on the bicep, for Christ's sake."
He's not gonna be leaking spleen through his trousers.
"This is Rose and Lily's story, and you won't let them do anything."
- They go to Dunkirk.
- And Johnnie pilots them home.
They're girls.
Girls don't want to be the hero.
They want to have the hero.
They want to be had by him.
Yes.
- Mayhew.
Is that Irish or English?
- Irish.
Faith and begorrah!

That's wonderful.
"There's still a few details to be ironed out, but now that the DEA is involved,"
I think he's looking at time served and probation.
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"Excuse me, the DEA?"
Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
"I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news, but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers."
I understand that.
But what does that have to do with the DEA?
"They're after some mystery man, some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg."
They want this guy like the ax wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up!"
This is good news.

Sousa:

How did it happen?
Professional hit.
Him and our only witness.
Must have been watching us at the scene.
I knew something was fishy about that anonymous tip.
Who does that?
A concerned citizen?
Concerned citizens call the cops.
This guy called us directly.
It's not like we're in the phonebook.
"Somebody targeted them, and I'm gonna find that bastard."
"Whatever happened last night, don't any of you forget..."
Krzeminski would still be with us today

Whether he pulled the trigger or not.
We're only neck-deep in this mess because of him.
Hmph!

Do you think I was too hard on her?
Definitely not.
"Why, if Ariel was my daughter, I'd show her who was boss."
None of this flitting to the surface and other such nonsense.
"No, sir."
I'd keep her under tight control.
"- You're right, Sebastian."
- Of course.
Ariel needs constant supervision.
"Someone to watch over her, to keep her out of trouble."
All the time.
And you are just the crab to do it.
[Sebastian] How do I get myself into these situations?
"I should be writing symphonies, not tagging along after some headstrong teenager."
Hmm?
What is that girl up to?
[Sebastian pants]
[Gasps]
Huh?
"Ariel, are you OK?"
[Ariel] If only I could make him understand.
I just don't see things the way he does.
I don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad.

Is this some kind of trick?
Test me.
Ask nostradamus to explain
How the future he sees for you and francis
Has altered since clarissa's death.
"Oh, yes."

Be very sure.

I'm not sure.
I'm not sure about anything.

I love them both.
"Begging your pardon, your majesties,"
But the king demands your presence.
A messenger has arrived with news
About the line of succession of England.
Their queen...
Is dead.
And she has named me her successor?
"After all her deliberations, they say she died"
Suddenly...
In the night.
"But England is yours by bloodline, by right."
"You must claim it immediately,"
Or your cousin elizabeth will seize it from your grasp.

You're going to want to just skip past the first seven pages.
Just me spit-balling our married names.
"""Clark and Emma Cho-Robertson."""
"""Ark and Clemma Chorobert-cho."""
Page eight is where the fun really starts.
"Yeah, he made a flowchart of every possible path he can take to end up with Emma."
It's inspiring.
CLARK:
"It has to be perfect, Jack."
"I don't want to have to sit our children down one day and say, ""Sorry I blew it with your mom"", and that's why you don't exist."""
There are endless opportunities all leading to the same outcome.
"Oh, a newscast with your neighbors standing in front of yellow tape saying,"
"""Oh, he was quiet and kept to himself."""
No.
Me and Emma in love.
See?
"Here's a section I like to call ""Sub Chart 0-41A."""
"Or ""Getting Emma and I to Hold Hands."""
Mmm.
That doesn't happen for four years?

"Clark, you are way overthinking this."
"In the wilderness, you act fast or you die."
"Or worse, you miss out on a threesome with Swedish hikers."
Jack's right...
Just ask Emma out.
And 20 bucks says one of those hikers was a dude.
"Eh, they're all beautiful over there."
"Wait, how did you know I like Emma?"
[laughing]:
"Without it, we'd keep doing"
The same useless things over and over and over again.
It's nature's way of saying

Pretty interesting tech equipment.
They've restored the power here.

"Every time you woke up,"
You'd just..
You'd start yelling at me
And try to leave.
"Pretty much like every relationship i've ever had,"
"Come along, dear."
I'll tuck you in again.
"He's wicked, isn't he?"
"Was there anything else, Julian?"
"One of these days, Auntie, somebody will cut that iron umbilicus... and maybe your throat in the bargain."
"Go to bed immediately, Merle."
And see that you stay there.
"Hello, Corbett."
Is Merle ready yet?
"Miss Gilbert, won't you come in?"
I'll tell her you're here.
Thank you.
"Well, good morning, Miss Gilbert."
How very nice to see you again.
"Hello, Mr. Langley."
Where are you two young ladies off to this time?
"Lunch, fashion show."
I'll be taking some pictures if sleepyhead doesn't make me late.
Merle had a restless night.
"You know, Mr. Langley, it's always been my one great ambition to be able to sleep in till 11:00 every morning."
"Well, you'll just have to marry a rich man."
"Unfortunately, they've all been spoken for-- especially the handsome, distinguished ones."
Gina--
"Well, it's about time, lazy bones."
"Hello, Mrs. Langley."
"Good morning, Gina."
You're looking very attractive today.
Thank you very much.
I wish I could have clothes like that.
This?
It's only 14.95.
But it's so sophisticated.
"The, um, autograph defense."
Exactly.
"So if the print won't do it, maybe what's inside"
The print will.
Now you lost me.
I'm gonna break down
The chemical compound in coop's fingerprint.
"Within that, I think there may be something he can't refute."
"Dimethicone silicone- based lubricant,"
And cells consistent with lambskin.
Lambskin?
That's a condom.
Exactly.
Coop was wearing a condom.
So was anna's rapist.
This spectra has a unique chemical signature.
Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna run it against the spectra from anna's sex kit.
¶ ¶
"So, um, what kind of condom do I use?"
What's my favorite?
My brand of choice?
I rarely use them.
"So it's kind of a, um,"
Personal question.
"Actually, it's evidence."
Really?
There were specific traces
In anna kitson that we also found
In the oil of your fingerprint.
That print is the same as the one on the murder weapon.
"So, just to get this straight, you raped anna,"
She won the money.
Maybe they have joint bank accounts.
"Yeah, or maybe he wants Craig for something else."
You know what?
Freeze their accounts.
"I want thorough backgrounds on Dawkins, Craig and Dana."
Run their names through NCIC.
"Chin, what about the phone you found?"
Dawkins got it from the car he stole.
But the call history was erased.
"He must have made some phone calls, reached out to the phone company and sure enough, two calls were made right after the escape."
The first one went to a local woman named Sofia Archuleta.
Archuleta.
"That's, uh, Dawkins girlfriend."
Warden said she's a regular visitor.
She's the first one he's going to for help.
What about the other call?
"That one was made to a local lightweight ex-con by the name of Makani Huku, they spoke for three minutes."
"Kono, follow up on the call with Makani, find out what they were talking about."
"Chin, pull Dawkins' jacket."
See if we find any links on Dana and Craig.
Easy.
- We need to get an address for Sofia.
I'll get it.
You should change your shirt.
You look like an animal.
"You should go apologize to your sister, she's been sitting there for five hours."
"Thanks, buddy."
I'll take it from here.
"Mary, I'm sorry."
You okay?
Yeah.
From my days in Monte Carlo.
"You been to Monte Carlo, Sam?"
No.
Have you ever been to Pahrump?
[Both Chuckle] Exactly how long have you been planning this?
"Ages, gumdrop."
"Now let's run along, shall we?"
"You know, I'd thought you had your work cut out since Mr. Wu's departure."
"It's so unfortunate, this haunting."
I had no idea when I had that newspaper delivered to him that it would upset him so much.
"[Chuckles] So, you had the newspaper delivered."
"- Oh, I'll get that."
- I'll have those then.
Hmm.
Knipex.
"If I held on to these, would you die a slow and painful death?"
"Well, if I did, you wouldn't be able to say you were Vegas's top host."
"Yes, but it suddenly doesn't seem so important, compared to your certain suffering and demise."
You'd rather kill me than compete against me?
"That's pathetic, really."
Honestly thought you were better than this.
I am better than this.
[Wind Howling]
[Siren Wailing In Distance]
[Phone Beeps]
Hello.
"Hey, Mike."
Yeah.
"Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not a ghost."
It's just a dislodged cable.
"Uh, must be the wind."
"- Yeah, right."
You're like the good-looking guy from high school who knows how cute he is and just won't take no for an answer.
"I've got your black Mercedes,"
I'm sending you the grid coordinates and imagery now.
"Thank you, thank you, thank you."
"Next leave, beers are on me, okay?"
"Oh, you are not getting off that easy."
You got her to use a military recon satellite and then you made a date?
I'm a multi-tasker.
Impressive.
"There, address that."
He just pulled in to Makani Kai Aviation.
It's a helicopter tour operator.
"- Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
- Fly.
"Please, I'm begging you."
We didn't do any...
- Will you shut up?
"- Hey, where do you wanna go?"
There's an airport on the north side of Molokai.
Get me there and I'll let them go.
- Danny.
Dawkins has hostages.
"No, no."
"According to Makani Kai Aviation, their bird took off with a pilot and a family of three coming back from a tour."
"- Chin, where's your friend?"
- On his way as we speak.
"Danny, contact Honolulu approach."
"Get me the direction that island bird is headed, okay?"
- You got it.
- Good.
"- Hey, it's all good, bro, mahalo."
- No problem.
"but I'm here now, dear."
Mother.
So I sent you here to wed a king
And find you engaged to a bastard.
"My darling, your engagement"
To francis was a careful negotiation set in place
When you were six.
And now you tell me
That you threw it all away because of a prophecy.
"One I believe, mother."
I did this and bash went along with it to save francis's life.
From a fate a magician predicted.
"Mother, it's all very..."
Complicated.
And we haven't been together in so long.
I came to the convent for your 11th birthday.
"Half the ship's crew died along the way,"
But I was there.
Gift in hand.
I only meant to say that...
I've missed you.
"And I wanted to talk to you about this, about francis,"
"About bash, a-about everything."
Please don't make light of nostradamus's warning
Or my choice.
I make light of nothing concerning you
Or our country's future.
Perhaps if you met bash.
He's-he's kind and-and selfless and brave.
Do you love him?
I'm beginning to.
It all happened so fast.
Yes.
For three points.
"No he's not, is it?"
Yes!
Who is he?
Benedict.
"He was the last one, Benedict."
Your answers?
Ratzinger and Benedict.
Show me your first letters.
Yeah...
And that one?
I guess so?
Let's see if you're right?
"Correct, for two points."
"Now there's something rather interesting about Pope Benedict and the current Pope, do you know what it is?"
He's the last one to resign for a long time.
For about 600 years.
"And so you have a situation where we have a Pope who's resigned, and you've also got a Pope, who's Pope Francis."
So Pope Benedict is now known as Pope Emeritus.
"So for the first time in about 600 years, we have two popes who are alive at the same time."
"Right, where are we at the end that round?"
"Lutrophiles, eight points, very well done."
"Araucarians, you're on four."
"It's round two, and you'll each face two hives containing three answers relating to a specific topic."
You've 45 seconds to complete each hive and score a maximum five points.
"So Team Lutrophiles, you're in the lead, you get to choose first from..."
"So, choose your topic first of all."
Physics or Geography?
Geography could be a lot of things.
Shall we go with physics?
OK.
Dear little Buttercup
Though I could never tell why
A little louder.
But still I'm called Buttercup
Pool little Buttercup
"Sweet little Buttercup, I"
Robin?
What's happening?
"Batman, I want you to come with me later today and rob a bank."
"Robin, don't even joke about such a thing."
Have you lost all your sense of judgment?
"Holy reverse polarity, I did it!"
I got you out of Black Widow's clutches!
"Of course, I knew what I was doing but with my cerebrum short circuited I couldn't stop myself."
"You sit down here, Robin."
I'll retie your hands and pretend that my brain is still short circuited.
"Sure and it's a dark hour in Gotham City, commissioner."
Yes.
But I was faced with the decision and I had to make it.
How will we be breaking the news to the people?
We'll tell them the truth.
Batman was shot and killed when he and Robin...
Robin?
No doubt he's gone into hiding.
Most likely in the Batcave.
Maybe I can talk to him.
Get him to surrender.
So no more of the Dynamic Duo's blood will be spilled on the streets of our fair city.
"I'm sorry, sir."
Batman is not here.
I know that.
- We've lost the Caped Crusader.
I'm out of gas and so is he.
If I don't get him into a bed his UTI's turning into urosepsis.
I got to make water!
"Yo, doc!"
- You are one sadistic bitch.
- Now give me your middle finger.
I would if I could.
Any emergency meetings get scheduled?
"Just one, about this spate of ER closures in the area."
I've advised the board that preliminary figures show an increase in our patient load by 34 percent.
- Who'd you take to La Scala's?
- Sorry?
Which board member's ass are you kissing?
- Now the ring finger.
"- Robert, I simply compiled a report."
- Nerve regeneration's a millimeter a week.
- I'm not kissing ass.
It's not my dominant hand.
"In fact, I only agreed to take on your responsibilities out of necessity."
I'll be in my office in two weeks...
- ... and back in the OR in two months.
- I hope you are.
Thought about upping your Vicodin?
Ibuprofen.
I want to stay clear-headed.
- That's enough for today.
"- No, keep going."
"Sorry, have another patient."
"Don't get comfortable, Kerry."
- Is there anything else?
- Just your continued support.
Lizzy.
What else?
Checking account shows one charge last night at Sposare's Pizza in Baltimore just before 3:00 a.m.
"Pizza and beer-- that's a hell of a last meal, right, bo...?"
Go.
"Boss, we may have a situation."
That was the ship's commander.
All 215 sailors reported back for duty this morning.
"All except Petty Officer Adams and this man... 21-year-old Petty Officer Brian Smith, from Virginia."
Maybe a second victim?
Or maybe involved.
No way to know that yet.
Figure it out.
Go on.
"Hey, I'm just grateful for this time of year."
"Liberty Week, the sales almost double my regular day."
But you do not remember ever seeing
Petty Officer Adams this morning?
No.
"It's a real shame about that kid, but no."
I-I never saw him.
"I mean, look around."
"Not exactly easy telling 'em apart, you know."
"I think it was Mae West who said,"
"""You've seen one sailor's anchor, you've seen 'em all."""
"No, I just kind of meant that it gets hectic in here."
"You know, all of 'em in here at once."
A bunch of 'em all yelling for service.
"Anyone get out of control, start a fight?"
"Oh, no, nothing like that."
"No, no, these are all good kids."
I-I never had any trouble.
Are you guys here about Caleb?
It's the first symptom of flett-giordano.
Would you just excuse me for just one moment?
Where's Elka?
She said this thing had no symptoms... and I'm out there... limping around like Dr. house.
Elka said she looked it up on Wikipedia.
Wikipedia?
Wikipedia says that I'm 37.
And I should know.
"I'm the one who ""corrected"" it."
"Okay, calm down."
I'll look it up online.
Oh.
I'm terribly sorry.
Uh...
"So in, in terms of publicity,"
"I was thinking-- miss Chase, when exactly were you diagnosed?"
"Uh, last week."
Why?
The most acute symptoms... occur within the first week of onset.
"By now, you should be having trouble with... facial drooping, involuntary body spasms, word slurring, hysteria."
"Boy, this thing is awful."
"Yes, it is."
That's why we applaud your courage in going public... with such a disfiguring disease.
Disfiguring?
Who said anything about disfiguring?
Well.
There's that hysteria.
"Miss Chase,"
"I understand why you're wearing this scarf, but may we just take a look?"
"Oh, um, listen."
Could you just excuse me for just one more second?
Wow.
What about the Egyptian press?
What about the rest of the world?
They are colonialists.
I don't care if they have an agreement.
"These things are for Egypt, not for the amusement of a British aristocrat."
"Yes, monsieur, I understand."
Very well.
As you wish.
They say we must wait.
Go back to the tomb and watch them.
"If they break the terms of the concession in any way whatsoever, call me immediately."
The slightest infringement and we shall take control of the tomb.
You understand?
HOWARD:
We've counted over 600 objects in this room alone.
Everything has to be wrapped and protected.
"So far, we've used over half a mile of cotton wadding and 16 bales of calico, and we're only halfway through."
"- Good morning, gentlemen."
- Good morning.
"- Good morning, Howard."
- This is Harry Burton.
"If you need any photographs, speak to him."
I won't allow any other photographers in here.
"Oh, my God."
It's extraordinary.
"Carter, look at this."
"Oh, my God!"
"Evelyn, come and see this."
"Oh, that's beautiful."
Aren't they lovely?
HOWARD:
This must be his wife.
"Yes, Inspector."
This way.
"We are too late, Inspector."
"Search the entire hotel, they must not be far."
Let's go!
Wait!
"Listen, Inspector, it's Adriana's beacon, we have a lead,come!"
"Based on the distance and heading, they are driving towards Guayaquil."
"To Guayaquil, are you sure?"
"That is what I believe, Inspector."
"Hold all flights, no one must leave."
"Advise the patrol boats, we will comb the entire Guayaquil."
"Is she ready, does she have petrol?"
"Yes sir, shall I accompany you?"
I would not recommend it.
"Quickly, push off the boat."
Call the pilots and advise them to be ready.
Yes.
Ms. Bristol.
"HQ to flies, HQ to flies, HQ to flies"
"Flies to HQ, go ahead."
"This is an emergency, have plane 336 ready to carry out plan two."
We will carry out plan two.
Have them send a plane to cover us if needed.
"Send a plane to protect us if necessary, on the river."
"Understood, we will be ready."
"Captain, radar registers a light craft that is closing in fast to our stern."
Its Dinamo.
Prepare arms!
Battlestations!
"Attention, light helicopters,patrol entire sector."
"Attention, Yacht club, attention, Yacht club."
You have to use some kind of protection or you are going to be--
"Mom, I am not having sex, all right?"
Really!
I am not even close to an embarrassing degree.
Okay.
"I am sorry, honey."
I want you to be prepared when the time comes.
- Whenever the time comes.
"- lt will never come, not with Jordan."
- ls that what is bothering you?
"- No, nothing is bothering me."
- Something is bothering you.
"- Mom, you couldn't possibly..."
"understand or help. I don't mean to hurt your feelings so just, please?"
I am here if you need me.
You know that.
- That is good to know about.
- Yeah.
My uncle choked on a chicken bone.
"That's when the change happened, J ust like that,"
"Somewhere ln those few seconds, I knew my life would never be the same,"
- Did he survive?
- Yeah.
"I knew then that the rumor was right, Not ln actuality, but ln my heart,"
"Because at that moment I would have done anything, I wanted him so much,"
"Look, I didn't say anything about, you know."
- l know.
- l just wanted you to know that.
Thank you.
Because I'm not like that.
I don't do that.
No.
I'd rather get a prostate exam from a leper who walks away with nine fingers.
"Oh, would you please stop feeling sorry for yourself?"
I have to feel sorry for myself.
I'm the only one who cares.
Just like I'm the only one who'll have sex with me.
Really?
In front of your sister?
We shared a room growing up.
This is not news to me.
Excuse me.
I'm going to go wander the streets alone.
"Invisible, unwanted and unloved;"
a pathetic shadow in a city with no heart.
I forgot my windbreaker.
It's chilly.
I don't understand.
Is this a way to break in new shoes?
No.
"Once these puppies touch the ground they're mine, and I'll have to wear them walking up and down Hollywood Boulevard in order to pay them off."
"Pretty, pretty, pretty."
Good news: the wildebeest is in the curry.
The what?
Bernadette is with Priya and Leonard.
Message received.
"Commence operation ""Priya Wouldn't Wanna Be-ya."""
Hey.
Seriously?
Didn't you get enough of this cliquey crap in high school?
I wish.
A clique requires friends.
- I didn't have any.
- None?
That's why it's Yiddish.
I didn't know you'd taken up the language.
Abe laid it on me.
Abe's a good man.
"You're a good man, Pappy."
Underneath that Louisiana cane syrup plain red dirt.
"Not that different from the pavements of Astoria, where I'm from."
You and me are sticking by Judge Walter Stern.
"Man, thou art dust and to dust thou shalt return."
If there's anything I can do please feel free to call.
- Thank you.
- It's the least we can do.
Good morning.
Where's the mayor?
He had to go Washington on convention business.
This rates an inspector's funeral and that includes the mayor.
The mayor's absence in no way diminishes his concern for Mrs. Santos and her children.
Where'd they get all that stuff from in the newspapers?
At school they tell my girl her daddy was a drug dealer.
We'll get our press people right on it.
What about Internal Affairs?
What are those clowns doing?
Where you going?
- City.
- I thought we were in the city.
Not if you're from Queens.
Let's start over.
Where you going?
Manhattan.
Hop in.
Go fuck yourself.
"Not to be disrespectful but the Transportation Department wasn't prepared for 1,000 people."
Why is that lady rubbing on someone else's body?
Yoon Jae!
Da Ran...
You came?
Hello.
I came to see Yoon Jae.
What are you thinking coming here by yourself without saying anything?
!
I had no idea that he was a doctor!
And I came to see my body!
Your body?
"What, you don't think I'd be curious to see if my body's doing okay?"
And there's a precious personal item that I have to find too!
Then...
Follow me this way.
Hurry up and put this on.
"But, Teacher Gil..."
"There's a girl doctor among his friends, right?"
She's a little strange.
There's something weird about her touch.
Kang Gyung Joon.
You made my Yoon Jae be called an idiot...
Now you're even trying to get him to be called sneaky?
Sneaky?
!
Boys your age...
"I understand that when a girl even lays a finger on you, you think it's a turn-on."
Since I'm a high school teacher.
"But if you look at Yoon Jae's friend in that way with Yoon Jae's eyes, what do you think she'll think of my Yoon Jae?"
There's your disillusion growing again!
"You know very well boys my age are more likely to act out the more you act like that, right teacher?"
"Idiotic, sneaky and now incapable..."
"There are also ballerinas because in the ballet when a soldier dies from his body emerges his soul, his ghost, and that's a ballerina."
"Long tutu, white like the ""willis"" in ""Giselle"", classical, but with blood stain, red."
That's lovely.
- Yes.
- Alicia's loving it.
"Lovely, because from death emerges life."
- From the male emerges the female.
- Of course.
From the earth emerges...
The...
The... tree?
No.
From the earth emerges...
The... flowers?
No.
The ethereal.
"The ethereal, the impalpable, the ghostly."
Of course.
And I've got the music.
By Penderecki.
"It's for the victims of Hiroshima, World War II, but no matter."
Of course not.
And anyway Alicia remembers it perfectly.
That's the music for the battle.
It's brutal.
"And for the music for the deaths, I've got a masterpiece that you're going to hear right now."
You're going to flip out.
Take care.
"You take care too, Katerina."
Though you look gorgeous.
"""Trenches"" must be made."
And I shall.

"I guess like all treasure hunters, I mean, a little bit on the secretive side, you know."
"Youknow, I don't know how Dan reallyseesFred'spassing."
"But, look, they both persevered intheface of all kinds of adversity."
"Theyrisked,theysweated, they worked, they labored towards the common goal."
You don't get any closer than that.
"So,tothatend ,Iguess, theywerecloser than they thought."
"You know, whenever Rick would talk about this place, it was always about, well,"
Blankenship's doing this and Nolan's doing that.
"But we always thought, or it was our hope,"
- that we could work together.
- Yeah.
- It was my belief that we could.
"- Well, we did."
We did work together.
"Sounds like, to me, that you see it, and I think we all do really, we see Oak Island as a big giant puzzle."
"I know that Fred told me once that that's how he saw it,"
-a big giant puzzle.
-That's why they call it
- the Oak Island mystery.
-Exactly.
"So, you know, we got to get busy and start putting pieces into the right places."
- Amen.
- Amen.
- All right.
"- Okay, Dan."
"Okay, off we go."
We'll get back to work.
Yeah.
"Hey, remember, you're not going anywhere."
Okay.
"See you, Daniel."
[ Cheers and applause ]
I don't know why you keep encouraging our man Rutledge.
"I mean, so, your solution for everybody who owns an electric car is to buy a gas-powered truck, a gas-powered generator, and have him lead you around everywhere you go."
It's genius.
[ Laughter ]
It's about as good an idea as you getting behind the wheel of a race truck.
Aw.
[ Audience groans ]
I'm just saying.
"All right, all right."
"I think the important thing to remember is, we've all learned something here today."
Thank you.
We've learned never to let you be in charge of this programme ever again.
That's all we have.
We see you next time.
May I invite you all to join me in a toast?
"Yes, you can."
One year down at uni and we're all still breathing.
- Chin-fucking-chin.
- Chin-fucking-chin!
"Yes, thank you."
"We'll be celebrating later right, Gemma?"
"Oh, Jesus Christ."
"Oh, it's going to be a bumpy ride to Heaven and back."
Get off me!
"Chris, I've seen you in the shower."
You won't be reaching Heaven.
"- Screw you, Eleanor."
- Without your beretta?
"- Just shut the fuck up, all right?"
- She's only winding you up.
"Well, he and Trimbole are a little too close with each other for mine."

And then?
A short sojourn to Albany...
... followedbyalongone at the White House.
"If I didn't know better, I'd be bursting with admiration."
I thought I'd come in and find you on your knees.
"Instead, you're turning adversity into triumph."
That's just a reflex.
An old habit of mine.
But it's still good to hear you say it.
The way you say it too.
"""""Adversity into triumph. """""
It's good to know you still believe in me.
Did I say that?
I don't know.
I thought you did.
Don't fathers listen to their sons?
How is your father these days?
I haven't heard you mention him for a while.
Where is he?
"In a nursing home in Crowley, Louisiana."
Plays dominoes with orderlies.
Fulminates over his Cream of Wheat.
Don't be too hard on him.
We can't dictate our finishes.
I don't like the sound of that.
Of course you don't.
Because underneath all that need to believe...
... underalltheconcrete you poured into my pedestal...
... somethingiscryingtogetout.
What?
You know I called Judge Walter Stern.
"You got 80% of the company in bed with the Navy, and..."
"And what, Ron?"
We need that military contract.
Not gonna happen.
Navy wants to go light.
"Steel is out, poly fiber is in."
"Dalton, did the contract expire, or did it expire?"
Expired.
And are we gonna get it back?
Don't see it happening.
"Legal doesn't see it happening, Ron."
Maybe we should stop yapping about a Navy contract we don't have anymore and figure out how (slams hand on table) to sell some damn steel!
I have to go.
Give our best to the Secretary of the Navy.
And good luck with the speech.
"As President and CEO of Wickes Steel  Shipbuilding,"
I'm proud of the work my family has put into building these great machines.
They're an unshakable foundation upon which the Navy can take her fleet to new heights.
How was that?
MAN:
"That was perfect, sir."
Thank you.
WICKES:
Was I loud enough?
JARVIS:
Always are.
(laughs)
"Mr. Secretary, I..."
I feel sorry for you having to follow that.
"Oh, I was going to have you take a look at my speech, maybe do a little punch up."
WICKES (chuckles):
"Like old times, huh?"
[indistinct shouting]
Tony!
He's in some kind of a room.
Like a hospital.
With machines and instruments and things.
"Oh, that's easy."
All we have to do is check all the hospitals.
While we going around looking for a fight.
Come on.
[victor] you will now function exclusively under control.
You will no longer think independently.
All thinking and reasoning will be done
By the voice that commands you.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
- What is your name?
- Tony.
- Where are you from?
Witch mountain.
Sounds like some hick town to me.
How did you suspend Mr. Sickle in mid-air?
By energizing matter.
Do you mean to say that you can control molecular flow?
"Yes, sir."
- How did you learn to do this?
- I was born with the ability.
I wish to see a demonstration of molecular flow.
You are strapped to the table.
Unbuckle yourself and sit up.
Power has come into our hands
Which is centuries before its time.
We must use it wisely.
!
What the hell?
!
Do not!
My truck!
Damn Noids.
Curse!
Look at this shit.
Ash scraped the engine and the whole system.
For the repair we need a GMM.
- A GMM?
"""A great damn hammer, you idiot!"""
The equipment and the ammunition are ashes!
We are 100 miles from the base.
A long way home without snow shoes.
Without Ash we're not going anywhere.
"The first time I agree with you, Bishop."
At the edge of the death zone is a probe with emergency equipment.
"If we get there, we have a chance."
Let's go hunting again.
You do not have to worry about hounding Ash.
... he will hunt us!
"The Humanoids were created, ready to serve."
They are stronger than we are and manage the weather.
"They are hairless, His blood is sour and black."
They are like mules and can not reproduce.
A security measure against genetic competition in the future.
Its Creator said:
His tranquility rests in Absence of reproduction.
But something is different now.
The rebellion is spreading.
"They fight until his death, something to protect."
Well...
We'll think about it.
"Well, how about this:"
Whoever gets out of their beanbag first gets what they want?
"Everyone, you are now free to date people in the office."
"Our not very long, extremely local nightmare is over."
"Hey, you got the ban lifted?"
Yeah... isn't that what you wanted?
Only when it was never going to happen!
I lied before.
"I am scurred, I am..."
I'm just a big ol' scurredy cat.
"I just, I really don't want to mess this up with Emma."
"Look, I know more about women than anyone except Gloria Steinem and John Mayer."
"I've picked up women in nine languages, and I only know five."
"As Jack Gordon, colon, Man of Action... copyright pending..."
I'm going to help you ask out Emma.
"Okay, I will gladly accept your help."
And I'm going to start a binder right now
- with some subsections and...
"- No, no, no, no, no."
You are not going to overthink this.
"My plan has one step, and that's called ""taking action""..."
Emma!
Clark has something he'd like to ask you.
No.
"Hey, Emma, I was just wondering... [laughing]:"
"Hey, it's Clark, from work."
What's up?
"Pretty good, pretty good."
[muttering]
I just wanted to know if maybe you want to hung out sometime?
- Report this:
the time travel is complete.
The visitors calling CWB.
We have 2 and a half minutes.
Send us some rope quickly.
The time travel is complete.
There is no need for any ropes.
Perhaps with a slight adjustment...
The signal is not clear.
"Give me the parameters, please."
CWB's question:
What kind of rope?
And what kind of adjustment?
It seems there was a mistake in the calculations.
Because we are at the top of a rocky hill right now.
60 meters above the country road between Bournak and Kamenice.
Poochie!
Third check.
No errors found.
"By CWB's estimate, the error must have occurred during mission execution."
The mission is dangerous.
You don't say.
Tell them that!
"What do you mean, I should tell them?"
That we cannot send another Expedition after them?
The World Council approves their return.
Based on CWB's data.
You know what?
The CWB can go and hang itself by the neck.
Explain!
The return would be risky.
It could deplete all the energy reserved for emergencies.
"Well, frankly, I'm worried."
"She's been wandering around in the bush this long, anything could've happened."
"Incidentally, how's Judy doing?"
"Dad, Judy's pulling a Rip Van Winkle act."
She keeps sleeping continually.
"Ah, she's probably just all worn out, honey."
Or she might have picked up a virus infection or something so the rest can do her good.
Have you heard from Jack and Mike?
Not a peep out of them.
I can't even reach 'em
- on the walkie-talkie.
- Neither can I.
"Well, maybe they got a lead on Sally."
I hope so.
"Well, I don't envy them trying to find one chimp in the bush."
"Well, let's just hope that she has that space helmet on."
(CHATTERING)
(GROWLS)
They're making too much noise.
We have to get rid of them.
We could tranquilize 'em with a couple of darts.
Most impractical.
I've got a better idea.
Oh?
- Gentlemen.
- Yeah.
We're now entering dangerous terrain.
This area is filled with giant pythons.
"Bone-crushing gorillas, rampaging elephants."
And there are poacher's pits and snares with poison spears all over the place.
Mean they're booby-trapped?
(ANIMAL GROWLS)
I would do anything for my daughter.
I would do anything for my daughter.
The best thing you can do for her is find a way to deal with your anger.
"I'm not here to be saved... not by you, Tim... or your God."
"I see that you're in pain, Mr. Jennings."
There is grace and forgiveness for you.
For everyone.
Do you believe that?
[Sighs]
I do.
[Beeping]
Wow!
Chocolate bon-bons from L'atelier de Bonheur.
"To be honest, I've never had one of these before."
You can't find Bonheur chocolates in Japan.
My friend who went to Paris for vacation brought these back.
These are for you.
How is it?
It's very smooth.
"It's not too sweet, it has just the right amount of bitterness."
"With its rich chocolate aroma and wonderful texture, the overall impression it gives is amazing."
Yeah.
"- It's a tender taste, right?"
It gently unravels your heart.
To be able to eat Bonheur chocolates in Treluyer's shop is such a luxury.
"But this means we've brought in food from outside, right?"
"Ah, I'm sorry."
"But I, love Bonheur's chocolates the most in the whole world."
"Geez, I'm totally jealous of French people who can eat this every day."
Mmmm!
I want to make chocolates like this one day.
"Learn how to drive, lady!"
I will get to the meeting when I get there.
I looked death in the face today.
Hel... hello.
"Yes, I would like to leave a message."
My husband ordered an eggshell dryer...
"Not talc, not parchment..."
Eggshell.
"Hey, you're home early."
What happened to you?
Doesn't matter.
"So, I called that appliance store, and I demanded that you get the dryer that you wanted."
"Oh, well, it must've worked because they're taking away the wrong one right now."
"Anything for you, princess."
Ooh!
Who's this guy?
"Get over here, sexy."
"If you want to see sexy, I just..."
- Ooh.
- Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
"Oh, d... what is all over you?"
"- Well, now you are."
- Ah-choo!
What do most of us want from life?
How about someone to love?
Somewhere to live?
Somewhere to work?
And something to hope for.
"Love, home, work, hope - ambitious maybe, but those four expectations define a good life and have done for generations."
"Now there is an election coming, and Panorama has been finding out if politics and politicians can really deliver what Britain wants."
"Sexually aware, but you just don't know it."
But when I read it...
You know what I mean?
"You're in denial of the fact that your parents had sex and everything and the second you pull that out, it was like,"
"""You bastard!"
"You know."""
"You know that he knows, because he swapped it for that."
"And you're lying there, in a foetal position."
My dick went backwards - I had a vagina.
"I'm lying on the bathroom floor, a new woman."
"I'd already undressed so I'm like, ""Oh, God, I've gone the whole hog!"""
"I went through the whole, like, opera of having a bath."
"You know, like..."
"# Just in the bath, la la la!"
#
"Singing too loud and kind of,"
# No wanking here Just enjoying the soap
# Nowhere near my testicles!
#
"And went downstairs and you know that thing of going, ""You know what?"
"""Maybe they played a trick."
"Maybe your brother..."""
I walked into the living room and I was just like...
"I felt so dirty but you're going,"
"""Just don't..."
"Play it cool, play it cool."""
Sat down.
And people think that...
This is genuine - Juliet Bravo was on.
I like Juliet Bravo.
I like Juliet Bravo.
Not in that way.
"Now, I liked Eddie and I want to help you, but you got to help me."
What's that mean?
"An airplane ticket and $ 10,000."
"$ 10,000!"
"For God's sake, I can't..."
"- That's a lot of money, what've you got?"
- Who are you?
"Marybeth Cogan, Detectives Endowment Association."
I represent the Santos family.
What have you got?
I made the meeting for Eddie with Tino so he could give up what he knew about the judge.
And what was that?
"10,000 and a plane ticket."
I'll give you the destination later.
Your information is worthless unless I can bring a witness.
Which Zapatti are we meeting?
Paulie had two brothers.
"Tino was John's boy, Vinnie is Jimmy's."
So Vinnie and Tino are cousins?
"That's right, cousins."
They have cousins in Louisiana?
"Down there, we're all cousins."
"If you got a cousin, you got a vote."
Then why not run for office instead of carrying the mayor's bag?
I consider it an honor not only to carry his bag but also to fill it with things I think the city needs.
"Oh, the kingmaker."
The man behind the throne.
I'm beginning to suspect you don't like politicians.
You're no politician.
They run for office.
You're a walker.
Take a right at this gas station because we are almost there.
"Captain, I see something."
Cover.
Kirk to Enterprise.
Lock on transporters.
Beam us up.
"Captain, we're coming under attack."
Unidentified ship quartering in.
We can't beam you up.
I've just rigged up defensive screens.
Keep those screens up.
Fire all phasers.
"Firing phasers, captain."
The alien has screens up too.
Take all action necessary to protect the ship.
We'll hold out here.
"Are you under attack, captain?"
- We could drop screens.
- Keep those screens up.
Worry about us when the ship is safe.
Kirk out.
"If they lower those screens to beam us up, they'll be open to phaser attack."
"We're hopelessly outnumbered here, captain."
Those disrupters versus our hand phasers...
"We're stuck with it, Mr. Spock."
We'll have to make do with what we've got.
"Kelowitz, Lang, flank out."
Lay down fire on coordinates Mr. Spock gave you.
Even if you don't see them.
Keep your heads down.
Helpless down here.
And the Enterprise...
"Sulu is an experienced combat officer, captain."
"So, off the line. 200bhp and a feather-light body on a dry track."
This should be fast!
"MUSIC: ""Son Of A Preacher Man"" by Dusty Springfield"
It's Dusty Stig-field!
This car was designed by Lotus.
"So was our track, so it should be brilliant here, as he goes through Chicago..."
Very tidy!
"Now, coming up to Hammer Head, this can catch out mid-engine cars but the VX has no problem at all!"
In the first sector this car was level-pegging with the BMW.
Can it beat the BM?
"Come on, Stig!"
He's crossed the line!
That is...
Quicker than an M3!
That is an amazingly good car.
"Now, we've got one minute left and James has to use that time to get that caravan past the speed record."
I've been looking at the Guinness Book Of Records.
"It doesn't say that I have to use a car to tow the caravan, so I've decided to rely on the most powerful engine in the universe - gravity."
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER
Do you know something - who'd like to see that again?
Yes!
Yeah.
Oh!
Ooh.
"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Look at that!
"I'm not sure that was faster than 125mph, but I don't care!"
"Absolutely don't care, and on that flimsy, fibreglass bomb it's time to end the show."
Bye!
This is Armed Forces radio reporting from London.
Never!
No?
Do you think I will put you out of your misery?
Wake up.
Haven't you learned your lesson?
Chosun Navy is the strongest navy there is.
"My comrades will chop off all of your heads, you wicked bastards!"
Long live Chosun!
Long live Chosun!
Hail Admiral Yi Soon-shin!
Hail Admiral Yi Soon-shin!
All of us are sinners.
"In the past seven years, we've buried countless comrades of war at sea."
"If we failed to put an end to this war, if we fail to deliver justice for the pain and suffering of our people, we will forever be bound by our sins!"
"Today, we 16.000 soldiers of Chosun, go to war with faces of sinners."
"But tomorrow, we will return triumphant with faces of champions!"
"Do not let one single enemy ship, one single enemy soldier escape alive!"
Long Live Chosun!
Long Live Chosun!
"Yim Chun-su an Kim Bok-nam, you are under arrest!"
What are you doing?
I haven't done anything wrong!
Let go of me!
I'm not a criminal!
Let go!
Wait!
This is a mistake!
These men are innocent!
Step side!
No!
These men are innocent!
"Well, I think you will find that particular rumor to be false because Kentucky was invested."
She was the new face of Betty's Bees.
We designed our entire brand relaunch around her.
But Betty is the face of Betty's Bees.
"Oh, no, no."
"See, Betty..."
Betty's the old face.
"""Old"" being the operative word."
- She's 37.
"- She's 38, which rounds up to 40 which rounds up to 50, which rounds up to old."
"And if you are in the business of trying to sell a product that promises youth, beauty and vitality you have to make a strong case for it."
- Mm-hm.
Correction:
We have to make a strong case for it.
"Kitty, I would be honored if you called Betty's Bees your new home."
Betty's Bees is my new home.
Ah.
Stupendous.
"WOOLSEY Well, well..."
- Chuck has a new home.
I blame you.
I blame me too.
That went well.
"Emerson Cod's inside man  a.k.a. Betty's Bees ' newest Bee-Girl, Kitty Pimms  buzzed through the offices of Betty's Bees  until she buzzed upon the office of one Kentucky Fitz."
Chuck/Kitty searched for any hint of a saboteur's agenda.
What she found  was the eponymous Betty Bee.
What are you doing in there?
- Cognitive therapy for claustrophobia.
- You're Betty Bee.
- That's right.
Why am I explaining myself to you?
You should be explaining yourself to me.
"I don't know, I'm sort of in a holding pattern."
My purity pledge group is playing biojeopardy tonight
There's free refreshment and girls.
There was a girl one time.
"I think it was a girl, I'm almost positive."
- I'm gonna keep looking.
- The circus is in town...
"Last time, I won the entire Rascal Flatt's catalog"
- on CD.
"- If you wanna hang out with your KT brothers, I completely understand."
Why don't you hang out with my Kappa Tau brothers forever?
- That sounds harmless.
"- No I'm serious, you can pledge KT."
"You're still technicly just a pledge at Omega Chi, why wait around for them?"
There's been a couple days and no notice.
We'd have so much fun together.
Let me think about it.
OK but what are we doing tonight?
"You know what, this guy in my dorm mentioned something about a '70s party"
Normaly I pull these things off but it could be fun.
The Carpenters are one the greatest most underated duos of all time.
Do you wanna join us?
It's like I'm living ever.
I bet the party money went towards the disco bar.
I think I'm gonna swing by Kappa Tau tomorrow.
"Episode 1x12 ""The great Cappie"""
Transcript:
"Kasius, Allysiah, HorcKs, AkaZab,"
Here you are.
I guess we should talk strategy.
"You, don't worry."
"This afternoon, I'm gonna pick up a ton of copies of TGG."
"- Of course, I knew her well."
Killed in the rearguard action at Gedden.
"I knew she was reported dead, sir."
I never heard any details.
There was a great deal of confusion when the High Council were restored to power.
Most of the old guard were killed in the fighting.
They remained loyal to Servalan right till the end.
"And a lot were executed later, weren't they?"
- All the leaders were purged.
- The penalty for choosing the wrong side.
I myself was under arrest for a short time.
"Well, I suppose it's better to die bravely in the field than to face execution later."
PA SYSTEM:
"Attention, citizens."
Attention.
This is a census call.
Assemble in the concourse now.
Use entrances 1 and 3 only.
"I repeat, entrances 1 and 3 only."
Let's try over there.
- Ah.
Any ideas?
- We'll have to go through him.
"That's what they're expecting, friends."
Follow me.
If you want to stay alive.
We'll lie low till the check is over.
- DAYNA:
What's the check for?
- Catching people like us.
The unadapted.
- Unadapted?
It's Eskimo or something.
BELL:
All clear!
No one's home.
It's freezing in here.
Is there a window open somewhere?
"Yeah, in the bedroom."
Otolik's an Inuit name.
The address he registered with the front desk is well north of the Arctic Circle.
So you can imagine he likes things a little chilly.
"His companion, on the other hand, might've preferred things a bit warmer."
His companion?
"Yeah, long brown hair."
Looks like Tendu spent the night in someone's warm embrace.
Before they went out the window.
Hand and shoe prints.
HOLMES:
Male and female.
So I find people rarely exit rooms via windows when they're not fleeing for their lives.
"Perhaps Owen Tuchman's killer paid them a visit, too."
That's one possibility.
The other is that they were worried that someone would catch them with this.
Looks like the murder weapon.
BELL:
"If that's a garden tool, it's not like one I've ever seen."
That is a hakapik.
(camera clicks)
It's a seal-killing club favored by the Inuits.
"Judging by this inscription, it is a going-away present, a little memento from home."
This hook matches O.G.'s head wounds.
I'm gonna put out a Finest Message.
Looks like we got a suspect.
He heard me.
"Given the circumstances, for insurance and safety reasons,"
I think it's better to handle his moves.
"Ludovic, let him drive."
I do not want interferences from the waiter.
- Ludovic.
The clutch does not work well.
"Do not stay in the first place, sire."
"I'm in the third, Ludovic."
- Excuse me.
Death for a turtle.
You can not die that way.
"His real reflections had saved the beast,"
But our vehicle had gone to a better life.
"We were there, in half at Bulgarian nothing."
"Listen to maps, hear phones, hear no one in sight."
Only the sky was looking at us.
My dear fellow citizens...
In these difficult times...
"In fact, foreign..."
And under this mysterious sky...
We must be humble.
I like it.
I have to find something destined for people.
"Yeah, maybe."
"Since when did you go to the king, Carlos?"
When does he ask for my opinion?
"My dear Carlos,"
I have three degrees and three positions as an ambassador
And nine years in service of the king.
Let the advice I give you.
"Mr Moreau,"
"Well, these head wounds aren't consistent with the butt of a gun."
They are not.
"They were inflicted with a pointed metal object, perhaps a hammer claw or garden trowel."
"Well, whatever it was, the killer took it with him when he left."
Who brings a gun and a garden tool to commit a murder?
"Hopefully, this might provide some insight."
I resisted the temptation to examine it before I could establish proper chain of custody.
You think it was the victim's?
There's one way to find out.
(phone beeps)
Retina lock can still be triggered hours after death.
Ain't technology grand?
"O.G.'s real name is Owen Tuchman, and he's involved in at least one dispute via text."
BELL:
"""Do not cross me."
"Stay the hell away from Tendu."""
Whatever that means.
"""Back off, or I'll destroy you."""
These are all from someone named Joey Ng.
He's in contacts.
Joey Ng of ProFine Peripherals.
Address in Williamsburg.
Who's up for a drive?
(school bell rings)
SHINWELL:
Chivonne.
I know you?
I'm your...
I'm Shinwell.
You said you want to talk?
"It's okay, guys."
Catch you later.
The druids supposedly hid
From encroaching romans in underground
Caves that were used for worship.
"Alright, why don't you head back to the hotel."
Stay out of sight.
We'll keep in touch.
"Okay, see you guys later."
(mace:) nothing.
Keep trying.
I'm certain he knows.
Da veiga just arrived.
Da veiga has arrived.
He's called the high council into session.
What the hell is he up to?
(da veiga:)so I come with
"The offer of a trade,"
Following the finest traditions of our order.
My son's life...
For that which you seek.
Fabrice da veiga.
Once the most esteemed brother
Of the gural nataz.
"Now, a man who's reputation"
And even loyalty is in question.
"For no good reason, I assure you."
But to show my trust in the
Chairman's wisdom and mercy...
I have brought the dagger and scabbard.
I have new information for the council.
He is working with sydney fox.
The agent who recovered the case
Saw it for himself.
"To dig the earth, Kolya!"
"Come on, help me."
"What's up, Nikolai?"
-ls it here?
-Where?
Next to the dig-out.
He used to be a scout.
"The place is dry here, it looks like a hillock."
-Whom did you bury?
- My dad.
"Well, come on."
"Are you surprised, mayor?"
It means that everything except for the comm point and a fewfiring slots is a mock-up made ofwood.
-A mock-up frontline.
- Exactly.
What about mortars?
Are they made ofwood too?
"No, the mortars, machine-gun slots and cannons are genuine."
"Ifwe considerthe terrain and the water spaces here and there, the firepower is enough... to extinguish a batallion,"
"But not enough to stop the entire offensive, do you mean that?"
What's wrong again?
What are you worried about this time?
There is no such thing as a mock-up frontline.
Ifwe see wood here...
-There must be some metal as well.
- lt is the same thing all over again!
"If ""ifs"" and ""whens"" were pots and pens..."
The offensive here has been confirmed bythe HQ ofthe front and we can not cancel it.
But we'll burythe whole regiment here!
-Do not teach me lessons here!
- l do not.
I've gone through all that before!
Why didn't you tell me you were coming here?
"When I heard you went to kill the leader,"
I got the fright of my life.
I'm really too embarassed to face you now.
"Because of my bad foresight,"
I got the whole fleet and you into trouble.
Don't blame it on yourself.
The reason I came here was to make a deal with the bandit leader.
"If it weren't for you,"
I wouldn't have thought of it.
"Commander, So Seo-No came to the hideout herself"
What?
What if the deal doesn't go through?
"You may be a merchant, but putting your life on collateral to make a deal, is really too reckless."
"Speaking of recklessness,"
You and I are no different.
I... have already placed my fate in exchange for your life.
"Even if it fails,"
"Even if I die,"
I will not regret this decision.
-Take her out!
-Yes.
"Miss,"
I will place mine in exchange for yours too.
Thanks to ALL of the D-Fansubs Team!

What happened?
Why you...
You jerks.
It is called Nymphs And Shepherds.
Who knows what a nymph is?
"Yes, Brierley?"
"Please, Miss, they're pink and they live in the sea."
You eat them in little pots.
Well...
"That's not nymphs that's shrimps, you fat head."
Hey!
Sh!
"Have you been in a Berni before, Enid?"
No.
"What I like, there's no surprises."
Can I show you to your table?
"Thank you, Barry."
Thank you.
"Thanking you, Barry."
"This is lovely, very kind of you to invite us."
"Yes, very much appreciated."
"We know you're an insurance man, Tubby, and you're basically a secretary, Enid, but we thought you'd like to know a little bit about us."

"And you know I love me some Bobby Cobb, but the guy who sees a half-eaten taco on the beach and says, ""Sand snack, score!"""
Is not exactly the ideal financial partner when you have a baby.
- Maybe you could say something to him.
- Relax.
Travis is nothing like Bobby.
"I mean, sure, he has the Cobb instincts, but he uses them in much smarter ways."

"There's no music class this week because Stan's daddy is, um..."
"Well, he's going through some things, so we don't have a music teacher."

Who?
"Oh, uh, I'm Grayson."
"Um, yeah, uh, Stan's mom's best friend's husband."
His eyes are so tiny.
[ Laughter ]
"So, the city council just stripped you of your mayorship out of the blue?"
They said I lost public support.
How could that have happened?
You did fall asleep a lot in those town-hall meetings.
My chair was too comfortable.
"And at that ribbon-cutting ceremony, you accidentally cut that guy's finger off with the giant scissors."
His doctor sewed it back on.
[ Sighs ]
"I've lost my Bobby, lost my job."
Now I've lost my mayorship.
I have nothing.
There was the scandal over your leaked Dick pic.
That was a picture of me with a guy named Dick!
That headline was misleading!
- Boom.
Just leave; okay?

So what do you get?

Please turn to chapter 3.
"And Mikey, could you come here for a minute?"
And bring your book.
Do you want to show me what's so interesting in that book of yours?
"Come on, Mikey, give."
It can't be that bad.
What have you done?
I...
I...
NEIL:
"Based on this, you think Mikey has an emotional problem?"
All we're suggesting is that maybe Mikey should see a child psychologist.
Christ!
I made a picture like this when I was kid!
I know.
But we feel that Mikey may be-- just may be-- suffering from an emotional disorder called unattached syndrome.
It's very common in adopted children.
Don't you know anything about his history?
I know Mikey.
"If anything, he's brighter than other kids."
"It's not a question of whether he's bright or not, Rachel."
Most kids don't mutilate their own arms with thumbtacks.
He did what?
And now I'm a cheating scoundrel?
"As long as you're a do-yooder, everything's hunky dory... as long as I deny myself, as long as I give away millions... without a word!"
"Am I to apologise because I'm rich, moneyed?"
Mr Om is saying nothing of the sort.
Why are you getting upset?
I'm upset because I considered him my friend
He's more than a brother to me
And he says I have deceived him?
"Well all right, I have deceived you"
Why don't you return my money?
Why not prove that love is stronger than money?
"The three of you, Om, Jai and Jagadish"
"Come on, get together!"
Pay me back
"Else, vacate your house in 48 hours."
I'm going to get a court order
And don't come to work from tomorrow onwards
They will vacate the house.
"You told me, they're men of word"
"Papa, Uncle Jai is leaving"
Brother...
Yes Jai...?
I want to talk to you.
You are returning?
"Yes, I'm leaving"
"If I don't leave, there will be a big problem"
Do you have your green card?
I have it
But I might lose my job.
You got my go-ahead
"Besides, what can you achieve living in this country?"
Go away
"In my statement, I told the police that the victim stepped into traffic and that I didn't have enough time to brake, but that was a lie."
The truth is...
I wasn't even looking at the road when it happened.
(crying):
"I was on my phone, reading a text."
"Because of my own carelessness, an innocent man died."
There hasn't been a day that's gone by that I haven't thought about it.
I'm so sorry.
Got him.
(sobbing):
I wanted to tell his family.
I even wrote the e-mail that I was gonna send.
"But you never did, did you?"
Sorry.
(crying continues)
And now the world will see you for what you really are:
a coward and a liar.
3236.
You're letting me go?
(soft chuckle) No.
"Even if I did, there would be nothing left to go back to, would there?"
But I will show you some mercy.
"(tires screeching, sirens wailing)"
This is Officer Kalakua requesting HPD and SWAT support.

Do that come hither thing.
They came that fast because it's their behavior pattern.
Joe's been feeding them.
Now look down.
You see a river of pigeon turd?
Uh... no.
There's barely any.
"It's not weird, it's cheap."
Joe's a guy whlooks for the easy way.
Probably been stealing cable from his neighbors.
Why not steal fertilizer from rats with wings?
You see a shovel or a dustpan?
"Mmm, found a scraper."
Looks used.
Sitting on a bucket.
Bucket full of pigeon crap.
Perfect home for cryptococcus neoformans.
Yep.
"Fungus enters the brain through the sphenoidal sinus, where it dances its triple threat of happiness, blindness, and intractable pain."
Let's hope this experience teaches our cop a lesson.
Don't cut corners when you're growing your pot.
See you back home.
I was there.
I should have found it.
"Yeah, you could have saved us a lot of time."
Get me a flush of ampho b and flucytosine.
I'll start us both.
I was waiting for lab confirmation.
Haven't heard from house yet.
Look at his eeg.
Theta band's been increasing steadily since... since we put him under.
"Guy's unconscious, but still in pain."
Further than that.
Do not believe.
Is love a fancy or a feeling?
- Or a Ferrars?
- Go to bed.
"""I do not deny that I think very highly of him."""
"""That I... greatly esteem him."""
"""That I like him."""
We are so happy that you invited Edward to Norland.
We're all very fond of him.
We have great hopes for him.
Mother expects much of him.
And in marriage.
She's determined both he and Robert will marry well.
But I hope she desires them to marry for love.
The heart doesn't always lead us in the most suitable direction.
Edward is a compassionate person.
Penniless women prey on that type.
Having entered into an understanding he would never go back on his word.
But it would lead to his ruin.
I'm worried.
Mother will withdraw all financial support from him -
- Should he plant affection in less exalted ground than he deserves.
I understand you perfectly.
Devonshire?
"My cousin, Sir John Middleton, has offered us a small house."
He must be a man of property.
He's a widower from Barton Park.
It is Barton Cottage he has offered.
A cottage?
Charming.
A cottage is always very snug.
And I got lucky.
"I had an apartment downtown, but home was City Hall."
That's where it all began.
"The day started out like other days, with a ceremonial function."
The mayor was giving the key to the city to the governor of Tokyo.
- He liked soup for breakfast.
Fish soup.
My dad offered to put it on the menu.
"But, ""No, no,"" Mr. Hayatama said who was a very gentle soul."
"""No, it would be too much trouble."""
"My dad replied, ""Too much trouble is no customers."""
"The mayor, and he was the best mayor the city ever had, was my boss."
I was his deputy mayor.
His right-hand man.
Or his boy  depending on who was talking about me.
But in Brooklyn  something else was going on that would change everything.
"It started with a cop  Eddie Santos, the toughest detective in Brooklyn North."
"He was on his way to a meeting with Tino Zapatti, a drug dealer  whose only distinction was being a nephew to Paul Zapatti, a mafia boss."
"James Bone, a child on his way to school."
Watch your step.
"Finally, Vinnie Zapatti, cousin to Tino  a rat Detective Eddie Santos had in his pocket."
- All set?
- Let's go.
It happened on the corner of Broadway and Marcy in North Brooklyn.
- You ain't going out in no playground.
- Please?
"- No, it's raining too hard."
"- Oh, man."
Here comes our boy.
Get out of the car.
You said you wouldn't take him in.
Just want to talk with him.
- No.
I would've gone down for murder.
It was close.
"Goodbye, Mrs. Price."
Good night.
"Hey, Nico."
"Even now, hours after the shooting took place, the entire area surrounding the station has been completely cordoned off."
We have word that the police are actively pursuing the alleged shooter.
"Until an arrest is made, neither his identity nor the identity..."
Did you get a look at the shooter?
Could you just hold me?
Please?
I'm sorry.
I've been crazy with this story.
But it's over now.
It's done.
Is it over for Nico Jackson?
I need you to trust me that nothing happened and that I'm done running around being certifiably insane.
If there's something you don't have... that you're searching for out there...
I want you to find it right here.
There's some music that you need to face.
As in the entire San Francisco Symphony with extra brass and a choir... 112 text messages.
- My God.
- They all want interviews.

Promise me you won't tell anyone where I'm hiding.
You can't hide.
But...
You can run?
"What do you say we... change our names, blow this town, start a new adventure?"
A good night's sleep and you'd power an aircraft carrier.
"Remarkable technology, is it not?"
Not you.
My b0315-
I made the first few for revenge but then
I started exploring new aspects of myself.
Can I have a sip?
Mmm.
"I have lived these past years, Henry."
"My lads, they get speeding tickets, they walk barefoot through the grass, and boy, do they get laid."
You'll never guess what we do here sometimes alone.
Hit play.
Over there.
Go on.

I've got you Under my skin
I've got you deep In the heart of me
So deep in my heart That you're really A part of me
I've got you Under my skin
I 'd tried so Not to give in
"I said to myself ""This affair never Will go so well"""
"But why should I try to resist when, baby, I know so well"
I've got you under my skin?
(WARNING ALARM BEEPS)
What is all this?
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
"Something's wrong with you, mate."
"Don't worry, it's not the clap or nothing."
"Just gonna sit you down in this ohair and take a look at you, yeah?"
The scan says you're in terrible danger.

Mamma...
Look.
This has just arrived.
"""I should be pleased to offer you a home at Barton Cottage, as soon..."""
- It's from Sir John Middleton.
- Even Elinor must approve the rent.
- Has she not yet seen this?
- No.
I will fetch her.
"Wait, let us delay."
I believe that Edward and Elinor have formed an attachment.
It would be cruel to take her away so soon.
Devonshire is so far.
- Do you disapprove her choice?
- By no means.
- Edward is very amiable.
- Amiable?
But...?
There is something wanting.
He is too sedate.
His reading...
Elinor has not your feelings.
Can he love her?
Can the soul be satisfied with polite affections?
To love is to be on fire.
Like Juliet.
- So are we all right?
"- Yeah, we´re fine."
All right.
Let´s do this.
I got the high res on monitor two.
Tony.
Didn´t know I was gonna see you today.
You know what we want.
We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus.
I already told Jack everything I know.
I want you to tell me.
"First Jack, now you."
What does that remind me of?
You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers?
"So, where do we look for Alvers?"
It´s a nice ring.
Who´s the lucky girl?
Hope you did a background check cos you don´t wanna make the same mistake twice.
You´re going back to prison.
There´s a good chance you´ll be executed as a traitor.
"You know if you cooperate you may be able to save your own life, but you´re stalling."
"Which means you know something and think there´s a play you can make, only now´s not the right time."
Very incisive.
I hope your wife appreciates that about you.
Why don´t you tell me about Alvers?
All I know is that he works only with Amador.
I don´t know him personally.
All we´ve been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases.
He had an mri on one of his knees.
There´s a prescription for antibiotics.
Treated for hiv.
(rapid bleeping)
Did you hear something...
Did he see something about the gun?
M r.
"Krakow, I'm going to tell you about a little legal term."
It's called accessory after the fact.
I don't like accessories after the fact.
I don't want them in my school.
You are going to come to my office today at 3 o'clock...
and you are going to tell me everything you know about...
Rickie Vasquez and anyone else who might be involved in this incident.
"And if you don't, no matter what your grade scores..."
you may not be going to this school much longer.
Do you get my clear intent?
- Yes sir.
- Good.
- What?
- l don't even want to talk to you.
"- Good, then don't."
- Did Rickie have the gun?
Give me a break.
"God, Angela."
"Look, because you don't know the whole situation."
- l just don't want to see him hurt.
- H im hurt?
What about me?
This is the police now.
I have to get kicked out of school for protecting someone I don't know?
Don't ask me?
And this has nothing to do with the truth.
Nobody is interested in the truth.
All they care about is...
- what they want to believe.
Come on.
THE END
Doomed.
"Doomed to a violent end, that Clara Nash was."
"I'm telling you, Sergeant."
Doomed to a violent end.
"I know, Mrs. Slocum, you told me."
"Three times, already."
"And I'm trying to find out, with your help, who murdered her."
The horror of it all.
[sighs]
And that wonderful Mr. Nash.
And that poor little boy.
Whatever is gonna become of him.
"Mom, please, mom."
Try to control yourself.
And to think that I was practically the last one to see her alive.
Me.
"Mrs. Slocum, if you could just give me a few minutes of your valuable time, l--"
My valuable time.
"Well, thank you very much, Sergeant."
"You hear that, Janie?"
The Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
Just goes to show how a person's whole life can be changed... just by somebody getting murdered.
"First, there was the flowers from the women's club... with a very kind note of sympathy."
Plus an invitation... to tell about my experiences on the fatal night.
And now the Sergeant wants a few minutes of my valuable time.
"Well, let's face it, Janie."
"How much was my valuable time worth, yesterday?"
"85 cents an hour, plus carfare."
"I was just a plain, simple baby-sitter."
Looking quite dazed.
And what happened to the skinny little boy?
When I looked around... he was gone.
I wonder how a skinny little boy could have carried Suzukichi all the way back here?
Because it was the water imp.
Water imp?
"Later on, the village people and my father talked about that."
But then they all came to the conclusion that it was the water imp.
"Those skinny, cucumber-like arms and legs."
"And his green face, like a leaf."
It couldn't possibly have been anything else but the water imp.
Grandma is pretty good at telling all those make-believe stories.
"Maybe it's our fault, listening to her so seriously."
"It's not make-believe, it's her dotage."
"After all, consider her age."
What happened?
The water imp was peeking in the window!
Stop talking nonsense!
Shinjiro!
"Why, you..."
Wait up!
"""Suzujiro confirmed the names of his brothers."
"""Please come to a definite decision to come to Hawaii."
"Tadao. """
"What'll you do, Grandma?"
I'll go.
But the anniversary of Grandpa's death is coming pretty soon.
I will go after I hold a memorial service for him.
All right?
What?
Grandma decided to go?
Yes.
[Ship's Horn Blows In Distance]

"[Woman] Mr. Devereaux, is this your first trip to New York?"
"Uh, yes."
It's my first trip.
Why did you choose to come by ship?
"The next several weeks will be very difficult for me... and, uh, the middle of the ocean is the only place... where the telephone isn't ringing all the time."
"Mr. Devereaux, do you agree with the recent survey finding... that showed that Mayor Lindsay was the sexiest man in the world?"

Here's the rest of the warrants.
The court order's in there for the wiretaps.
Judge gave you 60 days on it.
Tell Doyle that Mulderig and Klein will sit in for the feds.
They'll make all the buys.
Make sure you keep 'em informed of everything that goes down.
"You know Doyle there, don't you, Bill?"
"Yeah, I know Popeye."
- His brilliant hunches cost the life of a good cop.
"- Hey, look."
If this is the way you're comin' in on this... why don't you stay home and save us all a lot of grief?
- 'Cause that's my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.
Whatever.
"Bill, look."
Please...
Do me a favor.
Give them a chance.
He came in here with a little basic information.
I know you worked with him before.
There is no confirmation... but all 99 passengers and crew members are believed dead.
"Wow, man."
"Could I speak to Alexander Leek, please?"
- This is Leek.
"- Mr. Leek, this is John Klein."
I'm working on a pretty strange story.
I was hoping you might be able to help me out.
I'm particularly interested in your theories on precognition and prophecies.
Anything you want to know is in the book.
"Yeah, but the... chapter that you have."
on the entities you call...
Were you contacted... or are you pretending to have a professional interest?
Yeah...
No.
I'm a reporter for The Washington Post.
"Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Klein."
I don't work in those areas anymore.
I don't understand.
"To hear a voice is one thing... but this isn't just a message, it's a prediction."
It came true.
"These things Gordon's having, are they dreams or hallucinations?"
"The way he describes them, they sound like dreams."
I don't know.
He believes they're real.
I had a dream like that.
Yeah?
It was nighttime... and I was in the middle of the ocean.
"I was trying to swim, but I was too cold."
I kept looking...
I kept looking for something... to hang on to.
And there were presents... floating all around me.
They were wrapped up.
"I tried to stop my mother, but she insisted on giving an elopement party."
Which is a first for New Jersey.
I would be paranoid to assume the blue sedan was following Barbara and me.
There were plenty of other people on the bus.
But private investigators are paid to be paranoid.
So I made a mental note to check for the car when we came out.
I wonder if Barbara realized just how careful I was being on her behalf.
"- Yes, Mr. Masters?"
"- Hi, Higgins."
It's me.
"Magnum, why must you always call me on Robin Masters's private line... when there are four other perfectly good phone lines into the estate?"
"Well, it's the only number that I can remember."
"Um, Higgins, can I have the Ferrari?"
- You're asking?
- Of course I'm asking.
"This isn't like you, Magnum."
Not like you at all.
"Well, I..."
I need it delivered.
Delivered?
"Look, Higgins, I only have 24... 23 hours to solve this case that I'm on, and I can't do it riding around on a bus."
A bus?
You're on a case and you're riding on a bus?
"Don't laugh, Higgins."
Some of your best investigators use buses.
Buses can't be tailed.
You can always spot a tail when you're riding on a bus.
"Oh, Magnum!"
"This is too, too much."
"Just get me the Ferrari, Higgins."
I'm at...
Honolulu Lulu's.

"- Please, darling!"
Are they finally eclipsing Vogue in fashion for advance?
Skirt will only race clean when it shows the bat about one ways.
It's true!

That's because Roxanne Rochett is Coco.

So she has been is caught in our radar!
Her name is neither Deepa nor Ashwini.
It is Vasundhara.
Her native is Trichy.
She worked in a jewellery shop there.
She duplicated the jewels that don't sell...
And stole the original.
She was caught red-handed one day.
"From the May of 2013 to the November of 2013, she was imprisoned at Trichy Jail."
Her father is no more.
Her mother passed away when she was in prison.
Any relatives?
"One maternal uncle, Ravi."
Do you want to see who that is?
Look.
So it's a well-planned and executed ordeal.
But the mastermind behind all of this is
Vasundhara.
"I am not able to, Vikram."
You know that my parents are no more.
My brother is all I have.
Why does he have all these problems!
You could have told me in advance.
Never-ending problems...

Left and right and left and right!
A thousand pound and I'm still alright!

Or get stomach stance

"It's not that, jim."
It's what you're doing.
It isn't right.
You're only thinking of yourself.

I'm going to tell you something that might enrage you.
"Since mary's arrival, I've had visions of francis's death."
Violent images.
"They vary, but they were always tied to mary."
But they stopped completely when clarissa died.
"I have beckoned them, every way I know how,"
Because I had to be sure.
Sure of what?
That francis might live with mary.
How can that be possible?
"I warned you that francis, your firstborn,"
Would die because of mary...
You were very clear.
...Before either of us knew clarissa was your firstborn.
"The blood that has been spilled,"
"My blood yet,"
Was because of what you foresaw.
"It's not a science, it's a gift."
"Sometimes I hear voices, other times it's a feeling,"
A certainty as solid as stone.
And this new feeling?
It came to me today.
"I saw their life together, and it is happy."
"After dinner, and your usual game of catch with anne,"
- How is that saintly?
- ...she-asah il kol tzorki.
"My love, Jacob."
"If you ever loved me, stop."
- Stop.
- ...
She-asah il kol tzorki.
Stop.
Jacob?
Jacob?
Jacob?
"Jacob, you've had a complex partial seizure, which can cause psychosis, including religious psychosis."
Which means that this never was Jerusalem syndrome.
And I'm sure you're aware that were having these episodes.
Yes.
"What do you mean, you knew?"
How long has it been going on?
Since a few months before we went to the holy land.
That's when God first made himself known to me.
- No.
"- Oh, my God."
It isn't God.
It's epileptiform activity.
"Your brain has had spontaneous neural activity, and that's... that's what feels like God."
"We can't convince you of this right now, but what's more important is that we get you on the anti-seizure medication."
- And once the seizures stop...
- God will go away?
I don't want God to go away.
Repeat seizures can cause brain damage.
Listen to me.
"Yes, you are."
We need to section him.
There comes a time in every man's life when he wants to be left alone.
"Now, go away."
"All right, who wants the queen of the may?"
"How about you, handsome?"
You look like Cary Grant.
You want to dance with me?
"I'd love to, Queenie but, well, one of the other girls asked me first."
"Bye, darling."
Bye.
"Any cigars left, Cookie?"
"Come on, Cookie, get me a cigar."
What's the matter?
You on their team now?
You think I'm the guy?
I don't know what to think anymore.
I understand how you feel.
It's sort of rough one American squealing on other Americans.
"Then again, Cookie maybe that stoolie's not an American at all."
Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks.
They do that sometimes.
"Just put an agent in with us, a trained specialist."
Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp.
Not just whether somebody's trying to escape.
"What outfit we were with where we were stationed, how our radar operates."
"Could be, couldn't it?"
In this barracks?
Why not?
Just one of the boys.
"Sharing our bunks, eating our chow."
Right in amongst the ones that beat me up.
Except he beat hardest.
Who is it?
What lessons?
Violin lessons.
Is your violin tuned up well?
"Yes, but I first have to admit something to you, professor."
Tell me.
"What is it, Uluc?"
I am really bored with this violin.
Shall we just move on to another instrument?
Another instrument?
"Yes, professor."
I don't know.
Something more popular.
"For example, we have some entertainment nights in Urfa."
Entertainment nights?
Haven't you ever heard of it?
"For example, the Mici of Kahta... or may God rest his soul, the Boiler Bedih..."
"Yes, what do we do now?"
- What do you mean by what do we do?
"- Meaning, what's our new plan?"
"It's the fatal exam robbery, Chapter 2."
Are you doing this on purpose?
Speak in Turkish.
- That means we'll rob a bank.
- What bank?
The question bank.
The test exams for intensive courses.
Come on.
Why are we stealing them?
It's just a test exam as we call it.
"Because every week, their results are being mailed home."
"When our marks are low, our parents at home start nagging."
I can't take that anymore.
I had to give my undivided attention to the repairing of the wires.
Cutter and MacChesney should have watched out for the enemy... but they were off chasing butterflies or something like that.
"I finally got the detachment to the river, and we dived in and escaped."
"Tommy, you're so marvelous."
"That's all there is to it, I suppose."
On the last roof we almost lost MacChesney.
His great elephant hoof crashed through and stuck.
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.
"If you don't believe me, just look behind that shrub."
Save some for the elephant.
Destroy the evidence.
"- Stand guard, will you?"
- Yeah.
"Never mind that, Sergeant."
Stand easy.
"- Good evening, Colonel."
"- Evening, Stebbins."
"- Good evening, Major."
- How are you?
No formality.
We just dropped in to wish little Emmy the best of luck.
"That's very nice of you, sir."
I'll bring Emmy to you.
"- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant."
"- Yes, sir."
"Very jolly, sir."
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?
Is that punch?
"Some peoples calls it a punch, sir, but I calls it swill."
Nonsense.
Stebbins is famous for his punch.
But if you hurt Lucien... you know what could happen if his gang finds out what you did and why.
Eye for an eye.
They gonna come after me.
"Or worse, take it out on Chivonne."
That's why I asked you here.
"Talk me out of it, to help me find another way."
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
We were just having an illuminating conversation with Anezka here.
Thanks.
You can go.
We'll be in touch.
What's going on?
HOLMES:
"Were you aware that when Tendu disappeared, he was in the company of a woman named Libena Havel?"
No.
"No, I wasn't."
BELL:
"Apparently, she's his girlfriend."
"When we heard her name, it struck us that we'd already met one Czech woman, Anezka."
Having two different Czechs wrapped up in the same case seemed like more than a coincidence.
HOLMES:
We wondered if she and Anezka knew each other.
"If they did, Anezka could help us find Libena, which, in turn, could help us find Tendu."
"Anezka gave us this, from a gaming convention a few months back."
"She identified this girl as Libena, another of your trade show models."
"She said Libena and Tendu met at a party last week, here at this house."
Yeah.
HOLMES:
She also told us that she and Libena were more than just models.
They're prostitutes.
BELL:
"So what if after all this, you still fail Everclear?"

Johnny Ola bumped into me in Beverly Hills.
He said that he wanted to talk.
He said that you and Roth were in on a big deal together.
And that there was something in it for me if I could help him out.
"He said that you were being tough on the negotiations but if they could get a little help and close the deal fast,"
it would be good for the family.
And you believed that story?
You believed that?
"He said there was something in it for me, on my own!"

His true potential really isn't that much.
Ominae's cheap tricks won't have any effect on me.
I heard your unit was cruelly betrayed by him before.
Where is he now?
we lost him after the attack.
No matter.
I know he'll be coming here after all.
Arcam is just a private foundation...
I'll make this mountain his grave.

That's the mountain.
It's one of Arcam's.
Hey!
Damn!
Why are you so quick to start shooting?

"Even the one-way operator line, I didn't even think that was possible."
They cut into the operator line?
You did speak to someone on the phone.
You spoke to the operator.

Is on your brother's car.
"Under the hood, I guess."
Isn't that where there are?
"No, ma'am."
"In your brother's car, the battery's behind the seat."
"You see, they have these two 6-volt batteries wired"
Together to make a 12-volt.
I don't know about electricity and cars.
"Well, anyway, there's one more thing."

"Else there, that your brother might have been pushed."
"No, he was alone when he left here."

- The guy had a knife.
Of course we did.
What were we supposed to do?
"If I was there, I would have used my Frankie Fast Hands technique."
Technique don't mean shit out on the streets.
Guys have knives.
Yeah.
"In boxing, there are rules."
"On the streets, we ain't got no rules."
Ain't no rules out on the streets.

"There are no pictures, no duplicates of it anywhere."
I tell you only what I saw with my own eyes.
A headpiece like that one.
Except around the edges which were rougher.

Look here!
"Sit down, come!"
Sit down.
What is it?
This is a warning...
not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.
What about the height of the staff?
Did Belloq get it off of here?
"Yes, it is here..."
"This was the old way, this means six kadams high - 'about seventy-two inches'"
Wait!
And take back one kadam... to honor the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side.
Are you absolutely sure?
Belloq's staff is too long.
They're digging in the wrong place!

SABRINA:

"Ow, my foot!"
Sorry.
"Dreama, do me a favor."
"Go onstage and stall them until I can find the camera, would you?"
"Okay, but only because people are starting to think I'm talking to myself."
SABRINA:
Here I am in my moment of glory and no one can see me.
Too bad I'm not a bigger fan of irony.
She's really levelheaded and pretty down to earth.
Is that girl talking about me?
"Yeah, I voted for Sabrina, too."
"I mean, she's nice and she definitely doesn't follow the pack."
"Oh, great, I dieted until I became invisible and spent a load of money on a dress and they voted for me because I don't normally do that."
I'm back.
All I needed to restore myself was a little self-esteem.
And I definitely don't need to diet.
"In fact, if I don't eat something,"
I'm going to keel over.

"It may help pass the time while you remain here, and it would give me great pleasure."

"Yes, I would be delighted."
And perhaps we might discuss it when I visit you at Barton.
You are to visit us at Barton?
Oh...

Thank you.

"- Thank you, Mrs Wallis."
"- Thank you, miss."
I wish you a good journey.
"And you, Mrs Jennings."

I'm grateful for the pleasure of the company of such lovely people.

Manoj.
Based on what you said...
After cheating me as Deepa...
She didn't take much time to meet you as Ashwini.
She has met you even when I was still at the hospital.
"So, she might've chosen Manoj as the next target after you much earlier."
Yes.
So we must find out the way she finds these blind people.
Yes.
Apart from Manoj and I being blind...
What is common between us?
A blind man is cooking...
That made people to come to my restaurant.
That gave me publicity.
That helped my business as well.
Yes.
I have even written about him.
Manoj...
Has there been any newspaper article or TV news about you?
I'm not all that famous.
I'm just a simple man.
She will not come after a simple man.

"But, my dear, I did him a great favor."
We're chasing PPO contracts to compete against the HMOs.
- We won't sacrifice our commitment.
- That's what Pedes is all about.
We're a family here.
The kids you see today will be the parents of the kids you'll see in 20 years.
We believe in continuity and commitment.
So do I.
- So do you want to join our family?
"- Yes, I do."
"How's she doing, Peter?"
She's stable.
We're just going over her films now.
Nasty break.
Anybody want to take a crack at reading it?
Type three tibial and fibular fracture with complete displacement.
- Thirty percent chance of nonunion.
- Excellent.
- Were knee and ankle films ordered?
- I don't believe so.
Knee and ankle films are necessary to rule out injuries from transmitted forces.
"She's right as rain, Peter."
Order the films.
Come on.
I've got a couple interesting Colles fractures you may wanna look at.
Have you ever seen a middle ear bone fracture?
- Hey.
How did the interview go?
- Great.
- What did they say?
- They said I was great.
- Did you get the job?
- Ninety grand a year and nobody dies.
"I'm trapped at N.Y.U., and- and it's too late to transfer."
So what's wrong with cheering myself up with a little denial
"And a ""Gossip Girl"" blast or two?"
"Nothing, I guess, but you can always make it right"
With whoever you take down online.
And who knows if Chuck's even gonna have time
To do that with Lily or not?
"Morning, sunshine."
"I've got the Dom '95, your favorite."
"No, thank you."
And I much prefer Roederer nowadays.
"Oh, I apologize."
Nadine left behind some of her intimates.
She must have wanted an excuse to come back.
Or maybe she just left in a hurry.
"If you're here to mock me, I'm not in the mood..."
Unless you have some punishment in mind.
"We've broken up, Chuck,"
"And frankly, I don't care what you do."
But I can't sit by and just watch you avoid Lily.
I'm actually quite busy with work.
"Well, you had time for Nadine."
"Trust me, she was work."
"And I promise you, Lily is not sitting around,"
Wondering when she's going to hear from Chuck bass.
Justify not seeing Lily all you want.
You and I both know what this is.
"You've lost Bart,"
"Elizabeth betrayed you,"
And the thought of losing Lily terrifies you.
Please.
Spare me your N.Y.U. Freshman psych analysis.
"Look, I know you're upset about what happened... but I think you're taking this personally."
How long before the reactor is brought online?
"Assuming Hoshi can translate the interface, about 12 hours."
You have to delay it until we can verify the Captain's mental state.
"If he finds out what we're doing, we'll both end up in the Brig."
You're asking me to betray him.
You can't allow your personal feelings for the Captain to affect your decision.
We both know he's endangering this ship and our mission.
What is it?
A subspace vortex is opening off the port bow.
Tactical Alert.
"Captain Archer, report to the Bridge."
It's an Insectoid.
Three bio-signs aboard.
They're firing.
They're moving away at full impulse.
Pursuit course.
Arm phase-cannons.
Disable their engines.
[Grave instrumental music]
No effect.
Their main deflector's charging.
They could be trying to open a vortex.
Torpedoes.
Maximum yield.
Target their impulse manifolds.
CREWMAN:
Ready.
REED:
Fire.
ARCHER:
What the hell's going on?
Sort of.
"Because as your lawyer, I wouldn't..."
"You know what, it's your life."
You do what you want.
What?
It's the Veriscene case.
The judgment's in.
We find out tomorrow.
That's good.
I don't know.
I've got a bad feeling about this one.
How's everyone this morning?
"Well, Your Honor."
We seem to have a designated hitter here today.
"Yes, Your Honor."
"My partner, Will Gardner, couldn't be in court..."
"Oh, you don't have to cover for him."
I know Will's suspended.
- How's he doing?
"- Very well, thank you for asking."
Like a kid with five days until Christmas.
"Well, tell him he's missed."
Shall we get started?
"Plaintiff alleges that Veriscene, a drug administered for the cure of acne, caused Mr. Goode irreversible sterility."
"Accordingly, I am entering judgment for the plaintiff, in the amount of $25 million in compensatory."
"I acknowledge that this amount is in excess of the $18 million requested by the plaintiff, but I find the actions here particularly heinous."
- Your Honor...
"- Yes, Mr. Canning?"
You want to appeal?
"- Oh, I do."
Uh vehemently.
- As is your right.
"Now that they know our location and vitals,"
It will be perilous to continue with the expedition.
We should head back to BuYeo.
Sa-Yong is right.
"Miss,"
"Those people are with a vengeance, and they'll surely hunt us down."
Our best bet is to avoid them.
"We'd better go back, Miss."
I heard they still address their leader as 'Commander'.
"Ah, what's the use?"
They're nothing but bandits.
Hey don't look down on them.
They're even tougher than the average Heng-In soldier.
These men will gladly jump into fire at a word from their officers.
No wonder even the imperial guards are no match for them.
I... guess this is for real.
Brother.
Seems it's reckless to continue with this expedition.
We should go back to BuYeo.
"Yes, I agree."
"Brother, please convince So Seo-No."
"Truthfully,"
"No matter what adversities I may come across,"
I would still want to reach Go-San Nation.
But the fleet ultimately belongs to So Seo-No.
I guess we have to wait for her decision.
Follow me.
Where to?
To the bandit's hideout.
What?
!
Why?
"Yes, Miss Sheetal?"
What makes you remember me?
Did someone flirt with you again?
"No, nothing as such."
I read in the papers about your chase with the smugglers.
Did you read it?
They have glorified you.
I thought of congratulating you.
And I called you up.
Oh I see.
Now I get it.
I wondered why'd a pampered rich girl phone a pem police officer.
"But someone said it right, that today's girls are impressed by famous people."
You must've already boasted to eveyone that you know me vey well.
"You must be getting a lot of attention, don't you?"
What?
What do you think of me?
My mistake to call you up!
What do you think ofyourself?
A pem police officer.
What's the matter?
You seem to be short-tempered.
You think you've earned international fame with a piece ofyour exploits in the papers?
You think I called you because I am impressed by your fame?
Ifthis is not the reason...then there is only one reason leR.
And that reason you and I know vey well.
I'll definitely give it a thought.
Have seen yourself in the mirror?
I am afraid... yes.
While shaving today morning.
"Actually, my face is vey expressive."
Especially my eyes.
The Army has a new mode of transportation.
Did you hear about it?
Feet.
-Wise guy.
"-Oh, on the double."
"Hey, what's the-- here."
"Formation, on the double, hee-yah, line up."
"Ever-Everybody, look alive!"
"Excuse me, gentlemen, I'll only take a minute of your time."
I wish to discuss the motor pool and the work... (chuckling):
Work.
"Now, look, men, I don't ask you to kill yourself, but every once in a while, move a little."
"In case an officer walks by, he won't mistake it for a painting."
"And Zimmerman... didn't get those brake drums on the half-trucks yet, did you?"
"-Well, you know, Sarge..."
"-Oh, I know."
"You've been too busy washing officers' private cars at a buck a throw, right?"
"-Well, Sarge..."
"-Get into those fatigues, down to the motor pool, get those brake drums, and out of here!"
There's been a lot of goofing off going around here.
This has got to stop!
Day sheet in yet?
HENSHAW:
Yo.
"Paparelli, you draw guard duty tonight."
I know.
What's this?
"""Permission-- ten days leave granted to..."""
"Oh, when it comes to asking for a furlough, they're right on the ball."
Let's see which meathead this is.
"""Ten days leave granted to Sergeant Ernest Bilko."""
I got it!
There he arrived.
Happy wedding anniversary..
- Thank you PK
His name is PK.
He has recently come from the neighboring planet.
He settled here because of missing his vehicle.
"When all say astrology looking at the palm, my friend says it looking behind the palm."
LOL!
Do you think I am the joker card in a rummy game?
Today morning I saw a piracy CD of PK movie..
I'll tell the original story behind the PK movie..
"When Rajkumar Hirani met him in a bus, he narrated his story to him casually."
He seriously made it into a film.
- I will not believe..
I will make him believe.
Stretch your hands
OK..
"The place you live is Uganda, your wife is Linda and she completely ditched you."
"No, it is a lie."
[SpeakingGibberish]
Half proof has come and now I will show you the full proof.
"To send a few into coma by mixing cocaine in coke, he put cocaine packet in this pocket."
This is peaks PK sir.
Do you say what is in pockets just by catching the hands?
Oh my God!
All this looks like a setup.
I do not believe.
Will you believe if I say your hierarchy?
- Tell me.
Stretch your hands.
Your Name:
Maniratnam.
"Corporal Barbella, you're a dreamer."
"Now, look, you guys, you got to get on the ball."
You understand?
I want guys that want to soldier.
"You soldier for me,"
I'll interfere with the old man for you.
I-I...
What is that?
I cannot...
You making faces behind me?
What are you doing?
"Now, look, if you guy..."
"You know, Sergeant, some of the officers paid me for washing their car, and I figured if you're still running the snack-in-the-sack raffle, can I have a couple of shots at it?"
-(overlapping chatter)
"-Me, too."
"Yeah, me, too, Sarge."
Two tickets for the next dance.
-Put me down for the motor pool.
-Two tickets.
"All right, is this the suite?"
"Yes, sir, the adjoining room is right through there."
Is that all the flowers they got up here?
"-Oh, I'll get some more, sir."
"-Oh, never mind, we'll rough it."
"Hello, get me the main desk."
"All right, get that champagne spread out, get those cigars laid out..."
"Hello, main desk."
"Uh, look, there may be some poor souls wandering around the lobby looking for Squad ""B"" reunion-- ""B,"" ""B"" like in ""Bilko,"" yeah."
"-Send 'em up to suite, uh..."
-BELLHOP: 32C.
"32C on the double, look alive, hey... all right, good-bye!"
-You got the champagne out there?
- You need to have an injection?
- Yes.
The gentleman needs to have an injection.
"Ah, the gentleman needs to have an injection?"
The gentleman needs to have an injection.
"If I understand correctly, the gentleman needs to have an injection."
"- Yes, that's right."
- Very good!
"Come with us, we'll take care of it."
"Don't worry, you won't feel any pain."
"Alright, come in."
"- That's it, don't worry."
- Bend over.
Now stay right there... brace yourself.
A little to the side... that's it.
Get comfortable.
Uncover your rear.
- Your ass.
- Relax your muscles!
"Relax, you'll receive an unforgettable injection."
"That's it, don't move... remain still..."
"Good, his test results, they're not the best."
- Give me the X-ray.
"- Right away, Professor."
No wonder...
It's quite clear.
"Tomorrow we'll make a small intervention,   which will definitely fix it."
Happy?
"Cicchirini, take charge of the preparations."
"Leave it to me, Professor."
"- Oh, Professor!"
"- Will you let me by, Miss?"
"He'd enlisted October 11,1943."
Whatever jam he'd got in must have been just before that.
It might have made the papers.
"There it was, Father."
All over page one.
Only five weeks before Johnny enlisted under the name of Drake.
The rest was what you'd expect.
Nationwide search.
A murder indictment.
Search for Johnny goes limp.
Story dribbling off until it fell out of the paper.
The newspaper gave me answers but there were three things I had to find out.:
How could Johnny be a murderer?
Why come back here where he was hotter than the weather?
And why?
Why not another word from him since that first call?
"Listen, honey."
Haven't you got any radio news programs in this city?
All I get is commercials and a lot of that apple pan dowdy.
Not until 12:00?
"Well, thank you kindly, ma'am."
I thought I'd turned the juice off.
But I'd flipped it to the police call band.
Car 42 reporting in.
Car 42 reporting in.
Broken railing on Tarpon Springs Turnpike was due to auto smash.
A burned sedan.
"Body, charred beyond identification."
Been there two days.
Send morgue wagon.
- Car 42 reporting.
Got it?
except you who are a badass.
DICAPRIO:
"You hunt and fish here, right?"
AWA:
Yeah.
DICAPRIO:
"What do you, what do you fish and what do you hunt?"
AWA:
"In my territory I hunt fish, seal, narwhal, and polar bear."
DICAPRIO:
Is this polar bear?
AWA:
Yup.
DICAPRIO:
"Oh, well there you go!"
"And the ice here, since you've been around has it been decreasing?"
AWA:
"We used to have a solid ice, blue."
"Not light blue like this, blue."
"Hard, ice."
"Now we usually have a, kind of ice cream type of ice."
"It's ice but it's, when it starts to melt, it melts pretty fast."
Much faster than before.
"DR. SALA: 2040, you will be able to sail over the North Pole."
There's going to be no sea ice left in the Arctic Ocean in the summer.
We are burning so many fossil fuels that the ice is melting.
The Arctic is like the air conditioning for the Northern Hemisphere.
"If it goes away, that's going to change currents, that's going to change weather patterns, that's going to make floods and droughts more catastrophic."
It's the most dramatic transformation of a large environment ever.
Look at this.
DICAPRIO:
They're right here!
Sorry.
I had a little bit of a kitchen accident.
"I was trying to get an avocado pit out, and I did the stab method instead of the chop."
- Took off like half my--
- Ahem!
...but I'm good to go.
I know.
I'm here.
"I'm here, you're here."
"Let's do this, right?"
So I am Patty Solis-Papagian.
I represent Jason Larson.
"So two years ago,"
"Ryan Larson, father of Jason, employee of Borns Tech, blew up on a boat owned by the defendant."
What was he doing on the boat?
"Well, he was dumping explosives into the ocean."
Completely illegal.
"Now, what were these explosives that he was dumping?"
"Well, they were parts of an illegal weapon that was being made by Borns Tech."
Get this: we have video of the explosion.
"Not only do we have video, we have the blueprints and the model of the weapon."
We found them buried in his backyard.
Guy had them buried in his backyard.
"At the end of the day,"
Borns Tech is no good.
- [clicking]
"- They're just no good because they do dangerous things with hazardous materials, and they don't care who it affects."
They could care less.
And this is a trend that happens with big corporations all the time.
Your Honor?
"Ford with the Pinto,"
"Big Tobacco, NFL with the--"
The bank doesn't encourage people to keep cash in safe deposit boxes.
She spoke to you about keeping money here?
No.
We never talked about it.
Who else besides you would have access to this box?
Any officer.
"You'd have to have the customer's key or the master, like I used."
What are you thinking?
Just thinking.
"Where do you bank, James?"
In Syracuse?
Where do I bank?
"Your personal accounts, business accounts."
What's the name of your bank?
It doesn't matter.
"The rules on access are the same, industry-wide."
Ashur.
Dagan.
Take position.
Begin.
Good Tullius has taken his leave?
He has.
And what has he carried from our house this time?
"Ashur, fucking victor!"
"Rest, and tend wounds."
Tomorrow brings end of contest and appropriate reckoning.
I would have words.
As would I.
"Accompany me to town, and let us break them."
Melitta.
"Once they have departed, something I would ask of you."
I have felt your eyes lingering.
-Mrs.
Mackenzie...
She committed suicide over the kind of life Lucas brought them to.
We're not concerned here over Mrs. Cross' suicide.
But I don't see why not.
There was something terribly wrong in the Cross family life.
-Mrs.
"Mackenzie, if you please..."
"-Something wrong when a woman... had to raise her daughter up almost alone and trying to help her, and..."
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-...not being able to help.
-Mrs.
MacKenzie...
-Not being able to give...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, I'm aware of your deep concern over the suicide... but that's not the point at issue."
Did your daughter ever tell you she had seen Lucas beating Selena?
No.
Don't you think that if she had seen such a shocking incident... she would've mentioned it to you?
-I don't know.
"-Well, wouldn't she?"
Well...
"Mrs. MacKenzie, didn't your daughter ever bring home her problems?"
How many times do I have to answer your questions?
Until we find out the truth.
The truth is... my daughter did bring her troubles home... and I wouldn't understand.
"Well, if she did bring her problems home, did she ever... I wouldn't understand!"
The court will adjourn for a short recess.
Come in.
-What have I done to Selena?
-You had no choice.
But I did have a choice.
- On her husband
- last night at the cocktail party.
- Before he was killed ?
Yes.
I don't want to get her in trouble.
Do you have the application on you ?
"Term policy, a million upon death."
Jennie Hale.
She signed it.
Any idea where she is now ?
"No, I'd like a small service."
"Uh, nothing too pricy."
"No, no."
Cremation.
That's what my husband would have wanted.
So Jennie's got a million reasons to kill her husband.
Should we bring her in ?
I want forensic proof.
She'll wiggle out of it too easily.
Everyone bought one of those policies.
We may have forensic proof.
"There was trace on the murder weapon,"
- Bahamian aragonite.
- Sand ?
"Produced by coral reefs in the Bahamas, high pH, large granule size, unique to the region."
- So our killer was in the Bahamas.
- Not necessarily.
Remember that yearbook we looked at ?
"Oh, yeah. ""Senior class trip to the Bahamas was awesome."""
"I got a way to find out where that champagne bottle came from, but we're going to have to go back in time."
"Hey, Krystal, wait up a minute."
"Oh, officer."
And those propeller plans that you got for me... the plans you and Emmett worked to steal...
They were fake.
F-Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"[Sighs] Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
"And I wondered, do they even care how many people die?"
This administration...
"The stuff they get away with, it makes me sick."
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated.
Just think about all those... kids that died.
[Knocking]
[Elizabeth] Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted... and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
"Eric, we need an address on Julio Pena, and I need you to meet me there right now."
Thank you.
All clear.
All clear.
- H...
- Yeah.
You've got an X-ray machine.
This is a source of the radiation.
"Hazmat didn't register any, so where'd it go ?"
This cable's the pig tail.
Houses an iridium capsule at one end.
Iridium's the source of the radiation.
Capsule's been removed.
This is bigger than we thought Eric.
Why was Julio involved in this ?
Because someone was using him to finance the operation.
So Julio was caught in between the two worlds.
Whoever did this needed to get to him before we did.
Got a serial number.
We need to trace that number.
"Mr. Thomason, last year you purchased ten X-ray machines."
For welding seams.
I'm planning to start a construction company.
Then explain to me how one of them ended up in Julio Pena's workshop.
Don't know who that is.
Mr. Pena sells drugs in order to purchase the machines.
"Once in his possession, he dissembled them."
Dissembled them ?
- Why would anyone do that ?
- Excuse me.
Excuse me... !
This conversation is over.
Force of habit.
Fire marshals will be by to talk with her next.
Any impressions?
"If I had to guess, I'd say she was telling the truth."
Where's Joan?
She's at your computer.
"Said she has a theory as to how Tendu got his $100,000."
What do you got?
"Oh, hey."
"So, this is one of the last pictures that Tendu uploaded to social media."
"Now, the logo belongs to a company called AmpVX."
They make top-of-the-line headphones.
"According to this, the headphones he's wearing haven't even been released yet."
"A friend of mine who dated a Met once, she said the guy never wore brand name unless he was getting paid."
Tendu is a professional athlete now.
Significant percentage of the money athletes make is from sponsorship deals.
How do we get ahold of someone from AmpVX?
There won't be anyone in the New York office until tomorrow.
But?
In Beijing...
it's already tomorrow.
WATSON:
Hao.
Your call went well.
It did.
What is that?
That's roasted huitlacoche.
It's corn smut.
Do you want some?
Ugh.
No thanks.
"So, the VP at AmpVX's Beijing headquarters said they signed Tendu to a five-year, multi-million dollar sponsorship deal."
- And she is?
- Dr Goodyear's partner.
- Research partner?
"- Good Lord, no, she's not got the brains for that."
Her lesbian life partner.
It turns out Janet Cramer's got the bulk of the research squirreled away somewhere and won't give it back.
"Says it's hers, not ours."
"I really can't be dealing with these people, you know."
"What, lesbians?"
Librarians.
Oh.
"Awful, small-minded, orderly, finicketty little nobodies, stuck away in their dusty, desiccated bloody towers."
That research has to be returned to its rightful place.
It's for the good of the college.
Scientists have been waiting two decades for it to be published.
I've tried to reason with her but she won't listen to me.
Thinks I'm some antiquated ogre.
But she might listen to you.
I see...
"Tell me, when exactly does your nomination for Master come up?"
Peter!
SCOTT:
"Being a lawyer's easy, there's nothing to do."
You and I need to have a little chat.
Someone to see you.
- Good morning.
- It's my cats.
They need to be looked after when I'm gone.
- Right.
Come through.
(Phone rings)
"Don't worry, boss, I'll hold your calls."
It is true.
I forgot about the age being busy with the missions.
You should be very alert in this mission.
I am into form with my first success.
I will rage up now sir.
"No, just follow Karthik and that is enough."
"IG sir has asked me to follow you, keeping aside my seniority."
What should I do?
You should do acting.
There should be content in the character and I will sit in that putting a tent there.
"Your acting should be very simple, natural and convincing."
Stop it.
I gave performance as a jobless barber for 1 year.
I withstood the troubles as a waiter at the bar for 2 years.
I begged on the shore of the Musi River for 3 years.
I sold dry fish in hot summer without slippers.
Not even one could find me out as undercover.
What have you achieved doing all these?
It is dirty acting with expectations.
It is natural acting doing for happiness.
Take any creature in this nature and I will show you living as that.
Is it?
- Yes
Then the monkey.
Show us how it behaves in different situations.
Ask
Monkey in anger.
Monkey in fever
Cunning Monkey.
Alcohol drunken monkey..
Monkey feeling cold
"Wow, super!"
Of all the people!
Please don't say it like it was a terrible thought.
That superinjunction cost a lot of money.
DOORBELL
LAUGHTER
It's Rhys Darby!
Welcome.
Wow!
"Rhys Darby, ladies and gentlemen."
Have a seat.
Hi!
How are you?
Rhys Darby from Flight of the Conchords.
"Now then, everybody tonight has come dressed up because it's party time."
Are you a big partygoer?
"Oh, I'm king of the parties."
Really?
Not really.
LAUGHTER
Did you used to go...?
"Do you remember at the school disco at the end of the night, all having a great time, and then they'd play Happy Christmas (War Is Over)?"
# So this is Christmas... # And that was when all your mates would pair off with girls and I would be stood at the edge of the dance floor with my nose pressed against the window pane.
A metaphorical window pane.
Or were you one of the boys who managed to nab a girl for that important last dance/snog?
"Well, I'll admit"
I'm a keen dancer.
"And...and what I lacked in the initial, social, conversational period"
I would more than make up for once the song's come on.
I really clear my own space.
You can ask anyone and I am probably the hottest dancer that I know.
"Well, Rhys, I mean, we have a band."
We have a rug.
I didn't want to ruin our trip.
Seriously?
You know most chatter doesn't lead anywhere.
All it manages to do is scare people.
I also know that you would have never kept a secret if I was still at NSA.
"It's not a secret, Ellie, it's just a... you know, slightly calculated omission."
You know what that sounds like?
Like a reasonable justification.
"I think she was going for ""lie,"" but ""to-may-to, to-mah-to,"""
let's not argue semantics.
Let's talk national security.
"It's Thanksgiving, in an airport, and we have the usual menagerie."
Here comes Walking Boot Wendy.
"Clearly faking it, in hopes of a free upgrade."
"I see you, Wendy."
I see right through you.
"Ah, and the inevitable Pajama Man."
"Rolls out of bed, grabs his passport."
Sees the world as his futon.
"Brad Pitt wants his hat back, hipster."
"Seriously, what are people thinking?"
My parents actually used to dress up to fly.
Mine still does.
You'll meet him when he gets here.
Huh.
Like that guy over there.
Dapper Don.
That's what I'm talking about.
"Jetting off to exotic locales, like James Bond chasing after Pussy Galore."
No smelly tracksuit for that dude.
What's with my Car Salesman?
Thought you said you were wrong about him.
"It's my ship, Mr. Spock."
I should be there.
- We can't even get at them.
"- Nor can they at us, at the moment."
Not unless they move their original position.
That intervening high ground.
You remember the layout of this place?
The arsenal?
About 100 yards in that direction.
But after an attack as thorough as this one...
I'll risk it.
Kirk here.
Report.
"Captain, are you all right?"
Never mind about me.
What about the ship?
We returned fire with all phaser banks.
Negative against its deflector screen.
- Arm your photon torpedoes.
"- Aye, aye, sir."
Arm photon torpedoes.
Stand by.
Any identification on the attacking vessel?
"No, sir."
Doesn't correspond with any configuration we're familiar with.
We can't get visual contact.
She's too far away.
"Mr. Sulu, photon torpedoes locked on."
"Photon torpedoes locked on, captain."
Fire all banks.
"All banks fired, sir."
Sulu.
"Oh, no."
No way.
Things have gone too far already.
"Don't tell me, Samantha Josephine, you want to go to a lawyer, get the money and run, now."
That's exactly what I wanna do.
You have no sense of timing.
I have sense enough to know-
"You know nothing because if you did, you'd realise that that money cannot be transferred all at once."
It's gonna look overly suspicious.
How many times do I have to tell you?
The play must be performed one act at a time.
"How many times do I have to tell you that the longer we wait, the more chance we have of getting caught?"
"She's right, Joel."
"- I don't wanna hear from you, Rita."
- Why not?
Because any decisions to be made are mine to make.
Mine.
Is that clear enough?
Mommy.
Mommy.
"- Thank God, you're all right."
"- Oh, darling."
"Oh, yes, we're fine."
- You were extraordinary.
"- Oh, all in a day's work."
Welcome home.
"Well, I really must congratulate you, both of you."
"I guess the words ""brave"" and ""daring"" are appropriate."
"- Thank you, Blake, we appreciate that."
- Yes.
"Oh, Alexis, I'd like to talk to you for a moment, if I may."
- It's rather important.
"Now, Joseph, we heard your testimony this morning."
-Was it true?
-It was all true.
And you claim that your sister killed your stepfather... because he grabbed her.
He was a strong man.
We were both afraid.
If Lucas was as strong as you and everybody else has said... how could your sister possibly overpower him?
She was madder than he was and scareder.
"Lucas was 195 lbs... your sister, 11O lbs."
Did she sneak up behind him... and hit him with that piece of firewood when he wasn't looking?
"No, sir."
Were you watching every second?
"Well, I might 've looked away once or twice."
Did you see Selena hit him the first blow?
I don't know.
is there any doubt in your mind as to how that 1st blow was struck?
I...
I don't know.
It all happened so fast.
Joseph... you said that you told your sister to bury your stepfather.
-That's right.
She didn't want to.
-I see.
"And how old were you when you told her, when she did what you wanted?"
About 8.
In other words... a19 year-old girl didn't know what to do with the body... until an 8 year-old boy told her.
"-Yes, sir."
-I have no further questions.
No questions.
"You may step down, Joseph."
I wish to recall Selena Cross to the stand.
"Miss Cross, yesterday you told the jury that your stepfather... disappeared from home a year and a half before you killed him."
Stop it!
hey!
Get off her!
Get off her!
get up.
"How'd this guy die,doctor?"
"As I told you,when I know,you'll know."
Know faster.
Shaving off your moustache has brought back your usual impatience.
Good.
Means I'm doing my job.
I do have a potential cause of death.
But it's by no means airtight.
See this fracture?
"Well,yeah,you're inting right at it."
"The brain revealed an epidurm hematoma, verified by this cat scan."
Though it's far from massive.
"Statistically, it's only fatal in about 17% of cases."
- Blunt-force trauma?
- Most likely.
"We're looking at a baseball bat or a golf club, perhaps wielded by a disgruntled fianc?"
.
You ll me how;
I'll figure out who.
Intelligence has placed la grenouille in nairobi.
That might mean a shipment to somalia.
We'll continue to monitor these activities.
Just do ur best.
Ssion trouble?
It's need-to-kn.
Initiate the video conference special agent gibbs requested.
Have you figured out why somebody would unbury a body?
"You have to be careful what you say around a coma patient, Mrs. Farrell."
A lot of times they can still hear what's going on around them.
"Listen, kid, if he knew he was dying and we weren't taking action, he'd be pissed."
"Besides, I bought him a few squares in case he comes out 'cause he gave me my Johnny."
And nothing else.
"Your dad's hospital room is really nice, Johnny."
"Yeah, they're taking really good care of him."
How much does a room like that cost?
"I don't know, he's got good insurance through the fire department, so it's pretty much covered."
"Good, good."
"Ball park, what do you think it normally costs?"
"Like, a night?"
"Six, seven?"
600 or 700?
Wow.
"6,000 or 7,000, Brian."
Shut up.
Shut up!
That room was so tiny.
Whoever set those prices is a criminal and deserves to spend the rest of their life in that miserable little room.
"I mean, did you see the view?"
Of course you didn't.
Because there wasn't one.
"Chicago North, ambulance needed, Lincoln Park carousel."
Reported leg injury.
Ambulance 14 responding.
And did you taste the jell-o?
'Cause I did.
I was not impressed.
You took my dad's jell-o?
"Well, it looks like you got a broken fibula, but we won't know until we get some x-rays."
"Wow, that music just goes on and on, huh?"
"Well, don't use our own troops."
We've got some adapted Helots under training.
"Yes, I've seen them."
- What do you think of them?
- They seem like all Helots after adaptation.
"Suggestible, obedient and glad to follow orders."
They should make excellent troops.
I don't know.
"Something missing, I think."
"- Fire in the belly, Quute."
You can't fight without it.
"- No, of course not, sir."
- I'm meeting the President-elect later on.
"- Yes, I'd heard he'd arrived."
"- He's a Helot, they say."
- Practor?
"Oh, yes, born and bred."
It's a good idea getting one of their own to run the place.
"- Is he adapted, sir?"
"- It's not necessary,"
Practor's been on the Federation civil list for years.
He knows all the ropes.
So it shouldn't take too long to hand over.
Then we can get on to Wanta.
- Wanta?
- That's our next assignment.
"- Something to look forward to, eh?"
"- Yes, sir, I'm looking forward to that no end."
"Where exactly is Wanta, sir?"
- How long till we make planetfall?
- Just over two hours.
You'd better check out which gun kits you want.
And then I superimposed it...
With a page I photographed in a diary.
Of your diary?
But why did you...
Photograph the picture and didn't take the film negative?
In order to have a photograph...
That's even more photographic than the photograph itself.
"Further away from reality, than it already is."
To really show it's a photograph.
"And not reality, and even less than reality..."
And a lot further than reality.
"You don't like that one, do you?"
I find it strange.
Paris?
This is Paris.
In the 17th district.
And...
Is there a trick?
"There's no trick, it's only sort of faded."
"It's colored, it's colored..."
That's not part of the picture.
It's colored with yellow here.
"Yes, it's my watch."
The one I have around my neck right now.
But why taking a picture like this?
It's a still life.
Still life pictures are vanities.
Vanities in the baroque sense...
"Things that are futile, empty, abandoned..."
Perishable.
That will disappear.
And this one?
You hungry?
Want to go out?
Tired.
"Yeah, all right."
I need to tell you what I found out about Ronan Murphy.
"What, you looked into it?"
Murphy was a person of interest in the inquiry into the murder of Tommy Hunter.
In what way?
Ronan Murphy was one of Hunter's closest associates.
We never interviewed him.
Major Violent Crime did.
Ronan Murphy was interviewed about the conspiracy Lindsay Denton was convicted of?
Looks like it.
None of this was in the file.
It must been doctored.
You didn't get any of this from me.
"Well, well..."
Who'd have thought?
What are you after?
You ever heard the name Ronan Murphy?
Why d'you ask?
Just thought you might have heard the name.
Are you reopening my case?
"Forget it, all right?"
That's not why I'm asking.
"Look, I don't expect you to care, Steve, but I'm never, ever going to get back to being that person that I was before all this happened."
"You know, the only thing that kept me sane, the thing that got me up in the morning, was being a police officer."
"I want to find the people that framed me, Steve, and I believe..."
"Well, I HOPE that you do, too."
The audio file on this phone is as embarrassing to you as it is to me.
"Believe you me, I've got it backed up."
I don't enjoy threatening people.
You're not on the run.
Licence is in order.
Go ahead.
Go see Jess and the kids.
I'm not a control freak.
"This is where you really want me to live, is it?"
You wouldn't wanna live here.
Too many ghosts.
Door.
"This house belonged to Kevin Simmonds, a senior SOCO detective also head of Operation Merlin."
Him and his wife were murdered here a few weeks ago... while the kids were upstairs sleeping.
"Yeah, the kids found the bodies."
I saw something about that on the news.
"Yeah, I keep forgetting they let you lot watch TV in prison."
"Yeah, and we had toilet roll."
It's political correctness gone mad
"They dragged Alison Simmonds out of her bed, sat her down here, forced her to watch her husband's execution."
After that he wrapped this tape around her face.
Suffocated her.
Must have taken a while.
The man who organised it is called Jacob Gould.
A real high flyer.
But I think he had help from the inside.
From who?
Bent coppers.
They bring out the traditionalist in me.
I really don't like them.
"So you're part of this Operation Merlin thing as well, are you?"
No.
I'm the guy they come to when operations like Merlin go wrong.
"Who do you work for, then?"
"Oh, now, there's a question."
It was Henry's first tea of the day.
"Ground hemlock is brown, Henry's teacup was brown."
The powder could have been placed in his cup earlier that morning and George wouldn't have noticed.
"So in theory, anybody could have done it?"
I need to find Iris Lightman.
"Her anger when Henry refused to help her expose the ""Max"" character was palpable."
"What about Edie, with all her money worries?"
"She's hasn't exactly been all sweetness and light, has she?"
What did happen to all that cash that Edie's father had?
Vernon had money?
"Oh, yeah."
He made an absolute fortune on the black market during the war.
I had no idea.
"Sid, I've got a small job for you."
I want you to find out who Vernon's solicitor was.
"Sidney, your nails are filthy."
"You know me, Mrs M, always happy to get my hands dirty."
Ta-ta.
He's helping Edie out in her garden.
Sidney Carter in a garden!
She needs all the help she can get.
Which is why I've decided to enter best bouquet in the flower competition on her behalf.
You?
You're serious?
Perfectly.
A first prize could be very good publicity for her right now.
First prize?
I did flower arranging at finishing school.
I doubt you've ever read Constance Spry.
"No, I have not, and neither has the Father."
"Fortunately, he and I are of one mind when it comes to the floral aesthetic."
"Well, we will see about that."
What's going on here?
Tracing back our history... too.
I think Noah has another function besides controlling the atmosphere.
that no one would believe such a fact.
That just maybe the countless dinosaurs and other strange animals in stasis outside in the ark were probably used in experiments for creating the life forms that would carry on the next generation.
What are these things?
Noah's other function is that of a life-creating device.
Professor?
Isn't it incredible?
"The history of the human race was created within this ""Noah's ark!"
let us build a new world with our hands.
Worthless.
That is your wish.
Mankind has progressed in the wrong way.
Man is the only defective work that God created.
Are you trying to put Man on trial in place of God?
We must do it now.
I want the two of you to create new life forms for the next generation using Noah.
Professor.
Come let's do it.
No.
Damn!
Where the hell are the Doc and the others?
What did you just say?
I said no.
You're insane.
I see.
Then it can't be helped.
What are you going to do?
Get a fire extinguisher..!
Quickly!
Run!
"I mean, something to give it a little pizzazz instead of, like I said, look like a bomb shelter."
"This was Lou's only major building in Philadelphia, and I wanted to like it."
But I had to agree it was kind of disappointing.
"Around this time, an article appeared in the Philadelphia Inquirer about my search."
"It quoted me as saying that I wanted to hug my father's buildings, which was very embarrassing, but it stirred things up."
"I got several letters, including one from a relative of Lou's who was a rabbi."
He said that he'd officiated at Lou Kahn's funeral and Lou Kahn didn't have a son.
Hello?
- Is this Rabbi Kramer?
- Yes.
"Yeah, hi."
This is Nathaniel Kahn calling.
"God in heavens, the whole world opened up, my friend."
What are you talking about?
"I mean, gosh, I've been raising hell with the Inquirer."
"I said, ""Find that man."""
You're raising hell with the Inquirer?
- Why are you doing that?
"- To find you, sir."
"Oh, well, I'm glad you did find me."
"Look, don't forget Lou Kahn's my first cousin."
Lou Kahn is your first cousin?
And my parents was his godparents.
"Wow, I didn't know that."
"Well, I knew Lou very well."
"With all due respect, I hear Lou fooled around."
"Well, you know..."
"Anyway, I'm here, so that's a good thing."
What would you do with the film once you...
"Oh, it'll be on... it'll be on TV, you know."
- Wow.
"- Yeah, so..."
- Like what?
- Her bite mark on his hand.
You call that evidence?
(Travis laughing)
I warn all the spectators not to get too close to her cage.
That only proves the man can't listen to sound advice.
- When did the victim see her?
- How would I know?
Lots of people come through.
She's quite the attraction.
"Now, where you keeping her?"
She's in better hands than yours.
(Fen grunting and panting)
"You're safe here, Fen."
Safe.
No one will hurt you.
(Fen grunting)
(Fen panting)
Would you like to listen to some music?
(Fen grunting)
(piano and guitar music playing)
(Fen panting more slowly)
(Fen grunting)
What are you trying to say?
William.
You're just in time to see these gestures she's making.
- (Fen grunting)
- What do they mean?
I have no idea.
They require further observation.
"But her appearance, her choice in food, the scars; they all suggest she's been living in the wild for some time."
Fascinating.
"I use to told you that this Laxmi Narayan, will make her mother's dream come true."
I proud of you.
How many bullets you have shoot on throat.
None.
You much have cut him.
Kill by pushing the throat?
How cheap your mentality is Bhai... just like egg of lizard.
"Do not take life, give life to become Bhai(brother)"
You should learn some.
I am not cheep Bhai like you.
Who do business in diamonds and take others life.
I thought you have reputation.
But now i know that you have no reputation.
Did you kill her or not?
No.
Because i want to become Godfather.
"Godfather, even Chota Khujli can become father too."
But one can become God when he give life.
And today i saved her life here's your diamonds.
From today we have separate ways.
"Because i wont work for cheep Bhai like you, who sopil the name of underworld, for a underwear."
Check you diamonds and Chota Khujli marry your daughter with some Aslam Bhoda etc.
Now i don't have any interest in her.
What is this?
Diamond.
Is this diamond?
"Yeah see its written here too, pure diamond."
See this.
Where would i wear this diamond?
"Its you own choice, why you are asking me?"
"Check it carefully, Laxmi Narayan don't left any work undone."
What!
"So leave your number with Francesca, and we'll be in touch."
"- Excuse me, the DEA?"
- Yeah.
That's the Drug Enforcement Administration.
The feds.
I hope that I'm not the breaker of bad news but your nephew got mixed up with some pretty nasty customers.
I understand that.
What does that have to do with the DEA?
They're after some mystery man some heavy-hitter that goes by the name Heisenberg.
They want this guy like the axe wants the turkey.
Seems young Brandon may have information that could lead to his arrest.
"Jesus, cheer up."
This is good news.
"I mean, Brandon fell head-first into the doo-doo pile and came up smelling like Paco Rabanne."
"Wait, wait."
"Look, I just..."
I think...
I just think that we should review our options.
Options?
I'm gonna tell you what your options are.
You got a grand total of two.
Option A:
Brandon takes the deal.
Option B:
Brandon goes up to the penitentiary and gets his rectum resized about yay big.
"Look, look."
What about reprisals?
"I mean, if Badger..."
If Brandon informs on this Heisenberg...
"I mean, what if, God forbid that they decide to take revenge?"
What have you been telling him?
"The kid keeps spouting off about, ""If I talk, they'll kill me."""
"Who alibied out, by the way..."
The last two knives went missing.
"Well, Lanie discovered there are two different murderers operating on either coast using identical weapons."
All we have to do...
"Oh, whoa, whoa."
"No, no, no."
"T-there is no ""we."" You two are done."
"And if I catch either of you working this case,"
I'll have you both arrested for obstruction.
"No, no, no, no."
Mm.
"Hey, maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over?"
Go home.
Excuse me.
"T-this just came for you, Mr. Castle."
Oh.
Um... thanks.
Looks like Menendez isn't the only one unhappy about last night.
Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.
Good luck.
What's that?
This is payback.
Thanks for coming in.
Where is everyone else?
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night.
"It was messy, boarish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member."
- It was her fault.
- It was his fault.
"No, it was my fault, thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip's shoes."
"Mr. Wood, please."
Give me another chance.
"No, give me another chance."
With super-human courage that defies anything else he's done before he fights his way up out of the pit while the man-eating crocodiles gnash their teeth in rage at the escape of their victim.
"- Gee, crocodiles."
"Oh, boy."
- He'll get away from them like he did from those man-eating sharks.
Bet I could if I was Speed Foster.
- ready to strike.
Kadonka kill white devils.
Speed laughs at him in scorn and roars:
"Throw that spear at me and you die, Kadonka."
"Kadonka, he big warrior."
Hold poison...
"All right, lay one down there, boy."
I sure hope Frank gets to be foreman.
Hah.
"Boy, how we'll stall on him."
Or maybe you guys are too dumb to know how to stall.
"I guess everybody around here's pretty dumb, except you."
"That's telling him, Eddie, old boy."
That's telling him.
Ha-ha.
Frank will do all right on the job.
He's got lot of good practical experience in this shop.
"Every time I say anything, you always wanna start an argument."
- What is it?
- Don't be discouraged.
Keep trying.
Maybe someday you'll say something that makes sense.
"Hey, Joe, come here."
I need you.
"Sure, Tommy."
Anything wrong?
Nothing Dombrowski can't fix.
He has wit.
Do you know why you cross your arms?
Feels like you're talking to two people right now.
"Crossing your arms, whether it be consciously or subconsciously, is a sign of defense."
You're protecting your vital organs.
Do you feel threatened by me?
"Well, I don't, but the other guy might."
He is hilarious.
Enough psychology for now.
"What do you know about feminism, Wayne?"
I know it's unsafe territory to discuss with a feminist.
- Why?
- Someone will start shouting'.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Feminism is the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities.
"So, are you a feminist, Wayne?"
"Well, I trust my sister with just about any job under the sun over a man."
"- But 'cept this one, I guess."
- Excuse me?
"Not to be impolite but you're not exposed to talk about sex, politics or religion at the supper table."
"(SIGHING) What do you want, Wayne?"
"- I'd have a Gus'n Bru, likely."
- Not what I'm asking.
What's a Gus'n Bru?
Ooh!
I'll Google it and find out.
I'm kiddin'.
I know exactly what it is.
But we don't have any.
"So, what can I get you to drink?"
I'll have a Caesar and he'll have a...
- You're well informed.
- He's bound to sail here to safety.
"Here, he won't be trapped or cut from his bases and supplies by the enemy fleet."
- Admiral Jarvis is no fool.
- He'd be happy to hear you say so.
He would have done as I said.
Our responsibility is to carry out existing orders.
We're responsible for the ship.
"To risk it for orders, instead of using imagination..."
"When you get your own ship, you can sail by imagination."
My ship will follow orders from the Admiralty.
Whatever the consequences?
You may have power over life and death of everyone on this ship.
"- I warn you, if we come through this..."
- Yes?
Lf?
To have followed Admiralty orders may not be enough.
I will say this once.
"I'll not be bullied, and I intend to be obeyed."
Your friends mean nothing to me.
"While you serve this ship, they'll mean nothing to you."
You can go now.
- Steady as she goes!
"- Steady, sir."
"Mr. Ponsonby, set t'gallants."
"Smartly, Ponsonby."
"Aye, aye, sir."
Topmen aloft!
- Set t'gallants!
- I can.
Get them down.
This isn't a nursery.
Months ago.
"Look, I'm in love with Adrian."
All right?
"She doesn't want to think about getting married right now, but I want to marry her."
"She met my mother last Sunday, after church."
What?
"All right, then, we should disperse."
Get going.
(CLEARING THROAT)
I can't believe this.
Amy is married and
Adrian is semi-engaged or something and I'm not even allowed to date.
This is ridiculous.
Ridiculous times call for ridiculous measures.
Like?
Like staying home and studying and focusing on getting into college.
Getting an education prepares you for life.
Getting an education helps you think.
Thinking is a skill in itself.
"Look, say what you want about school, but life is all about does the boy get the girl?"
Does the girl get the boy?
Or does the boy get the boy?
Or does the girl get the girl?
"Or any of that, all of that!"
"I understand what you're saying, but let me put it another way."
Every relationship is a school.
Every person you meet is a teacher.
"If you don't like learning things in school, you're probably going to have a few problems learning from people."
"Now, that's ridiculous."

Congratulations.
Here's your graduation present.
-What for?
I got pinched.
"-Everybody gets pinched, but you did it right."
-You told them nothin' and they got nothin'.
-l thought you'd be mad.
"I'm not mad, I'm proud of you."
You took your first pinch like a man and learned the two greatest things in life.
What?
Look at me.
Never rat on your friends and always keep your mouth shut.
Here he is!
Oh ho...
You broke your cherry!
Congratulations!
"By the time I grew up, there was 30 billion a year in cargo moving through Idlewild Airport, and believe me, we tried to steal every bit of it."
"See, ya gotta understand, we grew up near the airport."
It belonged to Paulie.
We had friends and relatives who worked all over the place... and they would tip us off about what was coming in and what was moving out.
If any of the truckers or airlines gave us any trouble Paulie had his union people scare them with a strike.
It was beautiful.
It was an even bigger money maker than numbers and Jimmy was in charge of it all.
"Whenever we needed money, we'd rob the airport."
"To us, it was better than Citibank."
You got a phone?
Come on!
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you fucking believe that shit?
There was Jimmy and Tommy and me.
And there was Anthony Stabile.
Frankie Carbone.
"Fur, dumbass."
Fur!
"You ain't never turned to Animal Planet and seen a polar bear with a down jacket on, have you?"
"""Don't talk about the baby."""
"And it messes you up too, 'cause some people put their dogs in strollers."
"So you be expecting to see a little one-year-old, but you go up to the stroller and you see this shit right here."
"""What up, nigga?"""
What?
The hell you doing in here?
You got four legs.
"Walk, motherfucker!"
"""Don't talk about the baby."
"Not the baby."""
That reminds me of The Wolf of Wall Street.
Y'all seen that movie?
"Now, uh, first off, Margot Robbie, the main chick in that movie, uh, she can get the dick."
"That's my woman crush Wednesday every damn Wednesday, I'm telling--"
"She, ""Mommy doesn't feel like wearing any more panties."""
"And I said, ""I agree with you."
"Yeah, you shouldn't."""
"But the part that that reminded me of in the movie was the part where Mr. Jordan,"
"Leonardo DiCaprio, is in the car with his daughter, and he tries to run."
You know what I mean?
He tries to get out of there.
But he hits the tree.
"And that's not a funny situation, 'cause putting a little kid in that situation, that's not safe."
But what was funny was the caretaker that they had.
You know what I mean?
"That Black lady that they had working, the nanny, when she came out, she was like,"
"""Oh, Lord!"
Get the baby!
"""Oh, Lord!"
"I'd be worried about that, George."
"Dr. Ogden looked at it, she says it's healing nicely."
It does hurt like the Devil though.
- Maybe you caught something.
- Something?
!
- Rabies?
"- Henry, she's a girl, not a dog!"
What if she bit a dog before she bit you?
"George, you're not thinking clearly."
"- That's a symptom, you know?"
- Where is he?
!
Huh?
You've no right to keep her!
"She's my property, and I've a lineup of customers waiting."
"Well, then they'll just have to wait."
But thanks for popping in because we've got some questions we'd like to ask you.
- What were you doing in the woods last night?
- Looking for the girl.
Why else?
You were not looking for her; you were hiding her!
"Now, why would I do that, huh?"
Stop playing the innocent.
"You let her out, tied her up, no doubt waiting for the perfect opportunity to go back, get her, and leave town."
Meanwhile the Constabulary and half the neighbourhood are on a wild goose chase looking for her.
"Enough with the lies, Mr. Travis."
What is going on?
You're right.
I was leaving.
I wanted to get her as far away from this town before you bloodthirsty lot strung her up for something she had nothing to do with.
We have evidence that she attacked the victim.
"- I am innocent of what I am accused of tonight, but there is something else to which I must confess."
"From a young age, this man was not only my trusted physician, but the object of my lust."
He was a friend of my father's and forbidden to me.
"But in my innermost desires,"
I burned for him.
He is here tonight.
"In fact, he is the very man who brought me here to Rosewood."
Torrington... come.
Let us finally admit what has remained silent for so long.
Please... let us be married in sin together.
Come play our little game tonight.
You will be rewarded later.
- This is not the trial!
- Now it is time for you to play your part.
I can't wait to do this to you when we're alone tonight.
I've dreamed of this evening since you were a young girl.
- Isabel.
"- Tonight, the judges shall be judged."
"Dr. Cairn, this blade looks quite real."
"Calm yourself, Doctor."
It's all part of the performance.
"- Tonight, you will all be on trial."
"Aconites, you call yourselves."
"Playing with people's lives while you pretend to drink monkshood, wolf's bane."
"Well, tonight you drank the real thing."
- Dr. Cairn?
Doctor...
Dr. Cairn?
Get me out of here.
"Dr. Cairn, get me out of here."
- Run.
You run far away from this place.
"""I'm doing this because"
"I am your daughter"""
and there's this wonderful moment of recognition.
"No, I still can't read it."
It's because it's Gallifreyan and doesn't translate.
But this will.
"It's your daughter's name, in the language of the forest."
I know my daughter's name.
"Except, they don't have a word for ""Pond,"""
because the only water in the forest is the river.
"The Doctor will find your daughter and he will care for her, whatever it takes, and I know that."
It's me.
I'm Melody.
I'm your daughter.
That reveal was another Moffat moment that I got at the exact instant he wanted.
Holy crap.
"This whole time, really?"
The whole time.
"Once you see it, you're like ""of course!"
"Like Melody, Song;"
"Pond, River"""
and you feel like such an idiot.
"It was a good little surprise, there,"
Steven Moffat.
It makes perfect sense now.
Makes perfect sense.
"The Lady Cassandra is the last human, self-described."
"At this point, she doesn't look anything like a human."
"She's had so many plastic surgeries that she's literally just a sheet of skin, with eyes and a mouth and nose holes."
Because she had her chin removed because she said it made her look fat.
She's not unlike women I've met.
I lived in Hollywood for eight years.
Tell me...
"- Do you understand british divorce courts, Mr. Collins?"
- Sorry.
"UK law, elementary requirements."
Not at all.
My situation is such that discretion in this case with this single young woman is both financially and publically essential.
"So you, you do know about Zack Starr?"
I'm afraid so.
Yes.
"Only what Krista told me over the pillow, so to speak."
How did you two meet?
Social function.
"I was at a gallery opening, she walked in, and, I noticed."
It happened like that.
Did it?
So can you tell me where she is now?
No.
I haven't seen her in a few days.
"And to be quite honest, she finds me,"
"I don't have a number or an address,"
- just a willingness to see whenever she gets...
- ...bitch.
I tell you what.
"If you meet me at this park,"
"I've got a meeting downtown, I'll... have some of my people dig her up for you."
"I'm sorry, poor choice of words, but I'm sure once I get them onto it."
I'll be able to tell you exactly where she's been found.
"Now if there's nothing else, I think we're done here."
"There is one more thing, Mr. Van Sciver."
Do you know what this symbol is?
Should I?
That wasn't my question.
'Cause he can handle any situation.
"I think if he was accused of a sexual scandal, he wouldn't even care."
"Reporters come at him,"
"""Eddie, so you slept with some congresswomen, man."
"What you got to say?"""
He'll be...
"""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"
"""Let me tell your ass something right now."
"""I just want to be honest with you right now."
"""Let me tell you something right now."
"""Yes, I did."
"Yes, I did."
"""I did it."
I slept with her.
"""Let me tell you something."
"It was good,"""
"""it was sexy, and in the morning, we had waffles."""
"""Oh, yes."
"""And I would have slept with your ass too,"
"""'cause I love sex."
"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"""
Please don't tweet that.
I like my job.
"Don't tweet it, okay?"
"I know it 'cause there's always a group of women ready to tweet something and mess up somebody's career, even though, observationally, groups of women together are so funny, 'cause one of y'all always ends up"
getting too drunk...
"Oh, my God!"
Flirting with the wrong--
We've learned a lot about you tonight.
"Getting too drunk, flirting with the wrong guy, and then your girlfriend's gotta play Save-A-Ho and get you out the situation."
It's so funny.
"As soon as it happens, the girlfriend's like this, the one that's trying to cock-block, she's like,"
Barry:
I don't understand that.
Why me?
"You know, I'm so small compared to what these other people are doing."
"You know, it just doesn't make sense to me."
Morris:
"Caught between the machetes of law enforcement and the bank accounts of businessmen, the small-time growers are going to have to fight to survive."
I had such a dream of being able to grow legally my whole life.
"We're kind of hanging on by our fingertips, but we're gonna fight."
We're gonna fight for our place all the way to the end.
Morris:
Will you do it again?
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
"It's just, you know, why bother?"
Previously on X Company...
I have a proposition.
It's an informal prisoner exchange.
"It's your son Klaus, he's in a Russian POW camp."
I can have him transferred to a Canadian POW camp.
I need a man transferred out of the Gestapo HQ in Paris.
"Go, go, go!"
_
_
- Do you remember the deal we made?
- Short and sweet.
No strings.
"- Anyway, I don't mean to..."
- No.
It was nice.
"In three weeks, the Allies are mounting an operation on the coast of France."
"Ah, kid was breaking our hearts, telling us about his girlfriend dumping him."
"You know, saying how much he had to win in order to buy her an engagement ring."
"We kept saying that he should just forget about her, but, no, he just kept playing."
Until you stole all his money.
I thought about giving some of it back.
Yeah.
That's right.
"But then, that kid-- he just went nuts."
"Flipped the table over, and he just ran out."
- Where?
- How should I know?
"Hate to break Rule 22, boss, but his lawyer's here."
Then I'm done talking.
Oops.
Got the same story from the blackjack dealer.
"If what he says is even half true,"
Petty Officer Adams could have left that game and picked a fight with the first person that he saw.
Could be anyone.
Thoughts?
"Well, with no security cameras at the pizzeria,"
Ziva and McGee are checking neighboring stores.
"Ye, I know that."
"I asked you your thoughts, DiNozzo."
My thoughts?
"I thought you didn't like my process, my yabba yabba."
Doesn't mean I don't depend on it.
Oh.
"Well, in that case, the pizza guys are slimeballs."
Thin crust beats deep dish every time.
"And every suspect in this case has an answer for everything, but one of them's got to be lying."
- Yeah?
Which one?
'
I'm telling my advisor all this and I look in her trash can... and there's this half-eaten banana in there.
Nothing else.
"I pictured her sitting in this shoebox of an office, eating a banana by herself... and I almost felt sorry for her."
"Then she questioned my judgment about Berkeley, so I eviscerated her."
"She was welling up at the end, but she held it in until I was gone."
I have enough faculty recommendations to run for Student Council... so I don't need her anyway.
My locker's this way.
- Are they closed?
- They're closed.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
"Okay, one second, and open."
You made me a tassel-hat cake.
Filled with two pounds of crushed chocolate-covered espresso beans.
- You're evil.
- And you're graduating.
"- Yes, I am, aren't I?"
- Here.
I brought the pictures you wanted to see of my high school graduation.
"Hand them over, lady."
"- Okay, but don't laugh."
- I promise.
"I was younger then, not as refined."
- You're stoned.
- Totally.
- I thought you hated that.
- It was peer pressure.
"If Gilbert Garcia offered you a toke, you took it or took off."
Gilbert had a snappy slogan.
I was nauseous all day.
Your parents?
This is all very dramatic but what makes you so sure
- you'll find The Beast tonight?
- Stay tuned.
"Jo, on me."
You know what's great about science?
Eventually it can achieve pretty much anything.
Just put in the hours in the lab and you... can make all sorts of cool things happen.
This is bait.
A scent engineered at a cellular level to attract the predatory olfactory system.
"Which is smart speak for ""it rocks""."
And this is your basic Sunday roast.
Before all the cooking and the gravy.
Add the scent.
"It'll spread and if there's a supernatural carnivore out there, it's going to come running."
I'm switching to night vision.
OK.
Let's fall back to the truck first.
Steve!
Do you smell that?
- So...
- No.
Sorry?
"You were either going to ask me if you could help, or try to find out something personal about me."
Either way the answer's no.
- It's cold out.
- I'm pretty warm actually.
Wasn't talking about the weather.
I see movement.
Ten o'clock.
What are you doing?
!
It's a tranquilliser gun.
One technician.
- Or every agent on this train dies.
- Okay.
You need to relax.
- We still have 20 minutes.
- Not any more.
I want it out now.
Right now!
Now!
- I don't know about this.
- It'll look better when it's covered.
- With what?
- Blood.
"Reid, do not take this vest off."
"In hostage situations,"
SWAT sometimes won't even tell the negotiator when they're deciding to go in.
Do you know why that is?
Because the slightest change in tone of voice or choice of words
- can give the whole thing away.
- That's right.
Don't make eye contact with Elle.
You're a technician.
You've never seen her before.
- Got it.
"- And remember, play into the guy's fantasy."
Believe it yourself.
"Actually, did you know that dentists and surgeons have been recruited to secretly implant these during otherwise normal medical procedures?"
This has been happening on and off since the late 1930s.
- Told me to believe.
- Let's go.
All right.
One government-issued microchip.
My childhood was a nightmare!
I've spent the rest of my life trying to board up that haunted house.
"Francis, this is important."
"I really need to remember something, and I don't know what it is."
- But...
- Please.
You're the only one who can help me.
My earliest memories...
It's kind of vague.
I remember we had that apartment...
I remember it being really colorful.
"Come on, Francis, honey."
"Please, won't you eat anything?"
"We've tried the carrots, and the peaches, and the oatmeal, the apples, huh?"
Don't you like anything?
Lois!
Would you like to know what your son did to my director's cut of The Eyes of Laura Mars?
He also shaved a hole in the carpet with my new Norelco!
"I'm sorry, Hal."
"I asked him very nicely not to play with it, but he just wouldn't listen."
I can't get him to do anything.
"I've read Dr. Spock and Piaget and Eisenberg, and The Language of Hugs, all these books, nothing's helping."
What he needs is a little discipline.
I think he'd behave better if he just ate something.
Look at him.
He's just wasting away.
I'm going to give him another Hershey bar.
"Lois, no!"
You can't keep coddling him like this!
I am sick and tired of always having to be the bad cop because you're constantly giving in to him.
"Okay, Hal, I'll try."
"You keep saying that, and then you do it again!"
Nothing at all.
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- [sickle] what're you doing?
- [Letha] thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas With Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"[laughs] you do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us To penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
The therapist.
What about her?
She's written her name in Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.
Look.
Right here.
She did.
And this name...
Emile Sayles.
Same Handwriting.
"Looks like she signed him in, too."
Funny... she didn't mention that earlier.
"So, first, she treats the kid who committed suicide."
"Then a month later, she's at Kevin's funeral."
We got to find out what happened in those therapy sessions.
We got to go look at those files.
You want to get into the psychologist's confidential patient files off of a signature in a condolence book?
No.
"First, you look deeper into her and this Emile Sayles."
"Then we go to the judge, get a warrant, and then we go get her."
You understand?
Mm-hmm.
- Say you understand.
"- Don't... don't pull that ""say you understand"" thing with me."
That's... that's my thing.
"Well, don't you have a tank to get into or something?"
"""First you dig deeper, then you get a warrant."""
"Yeah, right."
The killer's sitting poolside in Acapulco drinking dollar beers and knockoff pain killers.
Liz Kenyon... a piano prodigy from the time she was 6 years old.
"What she was 12, this man..."
"Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does."
He pushed her until she broke.
Go.
"We could be spotted if we move together, so let's say our goodbyes here."
Be careful.
You must be out of the city before dawn.
Brothers...
Be careful.
This is it.
This is my last good turn as a friend.
I'm alone from now on.
I have no friends of any kind.
We will go our separate ways.
So don't resent me...
I will gladly accept any punishment if you withdraw your order to abolish the navy!
I will end my life here if you so desire!
You are continue your attempt to break me?
Must I take your life with my own hands before you submit?
Very well.
Consider your wish granted.
"No, Your Majesty!"
You cannot punish a subject by death for being forthright!
Do not interfere!
Please withdraw your sword!
Step aside!
Strike me instead!
This man has spent every waking moment of the day for a year protecting the southern front!
"If you forsake this faithful man, I, too, cannot observe your wishes!"
"Your Majesty, I beg you to strike me instead!"
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty!
Father nearly killed Yi Soon-shin and Minister Yu Sung-ryong?
"Yes, Your Highness."
"Barney, come with me."
Boys!
- Leave him alone.
"- You stay out of this, Michael Coyne!"
We're doing the job for you.
Maybe now the Yanks will leave our women alone.
Get away from him.
"Michael doesn't keep that gun loaded, Mrs. Coyne."
He told me often enough.
"Do you want to test that theory, Michael Hanlon?"
Rose.
Get away from him!
Cowards!
HE COUGHS
"Mr. Coyne, in light of what just happened, the Commanding Officer has placed your bar out of bounds for a period of two months."
Two months?
"He wanted to put it out of bounds, period."
- I had to argue very hard.
- Thank you.
Do you mind?
The Commanding Officer also wanted me to ask if Lieutenant Barnhill gave a good account of himself?
- He did.
- Good.
Good.
"We expect our fellows to give as good as they get, and apparently Lieutenant Barnhill is the current Kentucky golden gloves champion."
"That said, I want to say thank you for stepping in to save him."
"Now, Mrs. Coyne, I think it's more important than ever that we try to understand how to avoid things like last night."
I would very much appreciate the benefit of your local knowledge.
Rose is about as local as Winston Churchill.
But you're right.
She does seem to be able to make better sense of things in this parish than I do.
"I have to go, Captain."
Please come in.
Miss Dashwood.
"Miss Marianne, it is both an honour and the greatest of pleasures to see you."
- I shall leave you for a little while.
- I am sure the Colonel would have you stay.
"Excuse me, I have much to do downstairs."
"Do please sit down, Colonel."
Thank you.
"Dear Colonel Brandon, I must convey my sincere gratitude for all that you..."
"Oh, let us leave that as said."
Excuse me.
I interrupted rudely.
I am embarrassed at being thanked for what was a privilege.
I only caught a glimpse of you the other night.
You're looking so much better.
You must be looking forward to going home to Barton.
"Yes, it seems a lifetime ago that we left for London."
Take things very quietly when you get back.
- Promise me.
"- I am grateful for your concern, Colonel."
Be assured I intend to do little but sit in the garden and read.
"Ah, Gothic novels, with their ghosts and ruined castles."
- Why not?
- I play the schoolmaster.
You read Cowper and Scott.
"You have heard of them, have you?"
I have studied them a little.
I think them truly wonderful.
"Oh, indeed they are great poets."
But have you not read the majestic Milton or the demigod Shakespeare?
"""Fear no more the heat of the sun"
"""Nor the furious winter's rages"
I'll let you two get back to work.
What's that?
Just an old magazine.
You done in your room?
Yep.
And now I need permission to boycott an assignment.
Let me guess: math.
Nope.
Me.
My guidance counselor is making everyone write a two-page essay about who you really are.
I don't know the answer to that yet.
"I mean, how old were you when you figured that out?"
I'll let you know when I get there.
Figuring out who you are is a constantly evolving process.
"""Constantly evolving process. """
That's three words.
I need more.
"How about ""sarcastic,"" ""moody,"" and ""cynical""?"
I didn't ask you.
And I'm not a cynic.
"I am totally ""glass is half full. """
"I just acknowledge that the other half of the glass is a desolate void of disappointment, misery, and regret."
Preparing ahead makes me pragmatic.
"Uh, speaking of being prepared..."
Homework?
Done.
I know.
You should call Ripley's.
I need an opinion.
I can't decide which one.
"What do you guys think, plaid?"
Definitely.
The winters are brutal in Ithaca.
You'll be cold.
I'll buy a sweater.
You honestly believe that Jameses of this world can keep up with you?
Only in a classroom of overachievers like this can anyone possibly accuse him of being inadequate
Do you want me to skip college?
And stay in Jakarta?
Is that what you're asking me to do?
"There are some, outstanding universities in this city."
"Can you imagine, how good we'd be for each other?"
Yes.
But you do know that can't happen.
Of course I know.
"Do you know what ""apocalypse"" actually means?"
Tell me.
It's from the greek.
"""Apokalypsis"" meaning to uncover what you couldn't see before"
A way out of the dark.
You're sweet talk still needs work.
I'll get on that.
"You're a very good teacher, Eric."
I always forget stuff when I walk out the door.
If any of my ex-boyfriends had picked up on that perhaps things would have turned out differently... but probably not.
Zach was my first serious boyfriend and I was madly in love.
I thought he was the best.
You're the best!
You're the best!
Apparently so did my best friend Stephanie.
Baby!
I know this looks bad.
As well as Liz.
"Low doses of methaqualone-- downers, ludes, disco biscuits."
Very retro but making a comeback.
It was just enough to impair
Petty Officer Adams' motor skills.
"I mean, these babies can increase your sex drive, but it also can cause drowsiness and slurred speech, low heart rate, vomiting..."
"Ah, well, so much for the sex part."
So the question is: who slipped it to him and where?
"Well, test everyone who was on liberty that night."
Can I borrow McGee to help?
Absolutely.
"And I swear, your grandma got these crazy eyes and took off after your mom like a cat chasing a mouse."
"Ooh, I can still see them eyes."
"Would Grandma have chased us, Mom?"
"Yeah, she sure would have."
"Nah, she'd be spoiling you guys every chance she got."
"Right, Jack?"
"Yes, Michael, she would have."
"Hey, thanks for letting me stay."
"Well, the kids miss seeing you."
I miss them.
"Just gonna let the old man sleep through the party, huh?"
"Uncle Mike's got great stories, Dad."
"- You finish your paper, son?"
- Yep.
"Nine whole pages, single-spaced."
- Nice.
- Uncle Mike fixed the dishwasher.
"Oh, just a loose valve."
No big deal.
"Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Fix-It, but let's go."
It's my day to drop the kids off at school.
Can Uncle Mike come?
"Well, I don't recall the details but, when these things came up, they would have been looked into."
Did you ever deal with complaints of abuse at Sands View Boys' Home?
That doesn't ring a bell.
"There was a specific allegation made by the social worker that we're talking about,"
Oliver Stephens-Lloyd.
Sorry.
"Well, Stephens-Lloyd claimed he compiled a list of authority figures who, with the collusion of staff, conducted systematic abuse of boys resident at Sands View."
"See, I've never even heard of this Stands View place."
Oh!
Sorry.
"- I'll get that, love!"
- OK!
Here he is!
- Hope I'm not too late.
- Spot on.
"How you keeping, Ted?"
"Yeah, can't complain, can't complain."
I hope you don't mind me calling you.
"Not at all, sir."
A matter of professional courtesy.
As you were.
As you were.
"Oh, now, you'll stay after, won't you?"
Joyce'll kill me if I let you off the hook from her Victoria sponge!
"That's very kind of you, sir!"
Thank you.
Don't mind me.
"Now, where were we?"
Where's Hastings?
Briefing.
Inspectors and above only.
Kate.
Then he'd be out a career and a girlfriend.
He might have panicked.
"OFFICE OF MAESTRO REINHARDT OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20"
You must excuse me.
I'm very busy.
"I must finish my notes on Verdi's ""Forza del Destino""."
It's my new production for the spring.
"Actually, Mr. Reinhardt, we were hoping to finally speak to an adult."
"Yeah, no offense, but this crew and these musicians... getting high, having sex..."
it's like a frat house on viagra.
Finally.
People who understand what I have to go through every day.
How can I help?
Let's start with the night of the murder.
Did you see Laura during intermission?
"No, I did not."
Can we ask where you were?
We've asked everybody else.
I was right here.
Resting.
"- Okay, well, were you alone?"
"- Yes, I was."
If I'd known I'd be grilled by some Visigoth... / A what?
It's a barbarian tribe that invaded Rome.
I remember that from the one history class I didn't cut.
I'm sure you were a very charming street urchin.
Any other questions?
"Well, did Laura have any enemies in the house?"
"We heard she was very, very ambitious, and you were gonna make her first violin."
She told people that?
I suppose she felt entitled on account of... my friendship with her mother.
Or because she was a prodigy.
- Walking through the woods to meet my love this day in Marymount.
- Good.
"And what do you see, Lady Edith?"
Focus.
You must see through her eyes.
- I see...
I see fawns and nymphs.
They're transformed into brutes.
They dance around the maypole where we shall be married.
They are the devils in ruined souls that people the black wilderness.
- Good.
"Now, Lady Edith, what is your family's relation to evil?"
- We are well acquainted with evil.
"These darks and monsters are my brethren, maddened by their troubles into a gay despair like evil spirits in the presence of a dread magician."
- Good.
Now you will awaken... as Lucy.
"Now tell me, Lucy, is the night's ritual a dream... or a reality?"
- I...
I don't...
- Ugh!
- A dream?
- Are you trying to fail?
Are you doing this on purpose?
Are you trying to spite me?
- The men and women have seemed very pleased with my performance.
- They've been pleased.
They've been pleased with your performance?
This isn't a performance.
I don't want you to act.
I want you to become!
"And if you can't do that, you're worthless to me."
This session's over.
"What do you want,ron?"
I want to keep you up-To-Date on the case as a courtesy.
We're gonna argue self-Defense.
So?
We're thinking of calling you as a character witness.
To say what?
"In a self-Defense case, character for peacefulness,"
"For non-Violence, is admissible."
Did you know that?
Since you two are friends--
"Whoa,whoa,whoa."
We're not friends.
I took her to some basketball games.
We never even-- Fought?
Is that what you were gonna say?
You didn't get into any fights.
Good.
"It won't help us that much, but it's admissible"
To prove she had a peaceful character.
"Though i have to say,"
Testifying won't be so pleasant for you.
"The tabloids are all over this case,"
And the d.A. Will cross you pretty hard.
"As for how your wife handles it,i can't say."
"You do have a prenup, right?"
Or?
Sorry?
"You're the lawyer,ron."
Great lawyers always give you an alternative.
"Look,if you've got a business trip coming up"
"Or plans with your wife,"
I don't want a trial to mess that up.
- What?
About what?
That they're setting him up to laugh at him.
They're laughing with him now.
They think he's cool ever since he took up your cause.
- What cause?
"- ""Go, drugs!"""
He doesn't know what I do.
You keep clinging to that raft.
"Okay, this vote is on a motion by Walter Stringer to request a variance from zoning regulation 11.6, for a front yard setback."
- All in favor?
- Try 11.2.
- Excuse me?
"- It's zoning regulation 11.2, not 6."
And Walt is not adding a family room.
"He's adding a giant garage for his boat, which is gonna cut off all the light to his neighbor's dining room."
Read the plans.
A family room doesn't have concrete floors and a door that's operated by a remote.
That's complete bullshit.
"You're not in charge here anymore, Wilson."
Lucky for you or I'd throw your nautical ass right out of here.
Really.
"Buy a fucking slip in the marina, Captain Cheap-Ass."
Excuse me.
You're out of order.
"Now, all those in favor of granting the motion, raise your hand and say ""aye."""
Aye.
"All of those against, ""nay."""
- Nay.
- Motion is denied.
"- Fuck you, Wilson!"
- Go play with your dinghy!
Went to Armadillo's place to talk to him about Tio's murder.
- What'd he say?
- He wasn't there.
Signs of a struggle though.
"Bloodstains, seared flesh on the stove."
- Pretty ugly stuff.
- That sounds like Armadillo's M.O.
Checked Tio's phone records.
You were the last call he made last night on his cell before he died.
Yeah.
He sounded kind of agitated.
- We got cut off.
- Too bad.
What are you asking me?
"Look, I don't like these questions any more than you do."
I was with my guys all last night while Tio was being killed.
Feel free to ask 'em.
"Okay, then."
"Single blow, a heavy blade."
"- An ax, maybe a machete."
- How long ago?
"Based on core temp, I'd say recently."
- Three to four hours.
- So she's been dead since around 6:00.
Didn't say she was dead.
Skin lividity and clotting... indicate she was alive when this happened.
- Sadomasochistic torture ritual.
- Okay.
"If someone were trying to keep her alive, how long could she survive?"
"With a tourniquet and basic medical knowledge, indefinitely."
Until he tired of his domination and control Dr. Mengele experiments... and decided to squeeze the last breath out of her so he could watch.
"See, this is why you and me can't date."
"- Hi, I'm Dave."
"- Good to see you, man."
- How are you?
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm James.
- Nice to meet you.
- What do you play?
- Saxophone.
"- Oh, shit."

"When I think of New Orleans,"
"I don't think of recording studios, really."
I just think of hundreds of years of music.
Preservation Hall really took hold after the hurricane when people realized that there was something to lose.
Look at this guy.
Wow.
Yeah.
What a trip.
This is a trip.
It was a little tricky because Preservation Jazz Hall is not used to a blaring rock band.
"We moved the drums across the room from traditionally where they play, which opened up the sound a little bit."
Then we moved their amps...
Just baffled them enough so it wasn't completely collapsing the room with volume.
It's funny because you can hear people walking by on the street.
"You hear the horses clip-clop by and the carriages, and people peering in the windows and the street performers strolling by."
"Our microphones catch miscellaneous noises going on, and that's part of the charm."
Where's Ben Jaffe?
"Hey, Ben!"
Is it gonna be okay that we record here?
This is so cool!
This is like my childhood dream come true!
All right?
"What if our guy knew her at church, work, or something... and he's obsessed with her?"
But she dies.
She donates her organs... and he goes after the people that have them.
"Now, postmortem wrist wounds... blood loss speeds the decay of the organs."
"The result is, they can't be passed on again."
I'm betting that this girl Davison... is the donor for all of our victims...
"Getz, Tattersall, and Emma."
Emma is not dead.
I heard back from Ned in Indiana.
The latest victim was a heart transplant.
"If you'll excuse me, gentlemen..."
Emma.
"Please, it's Dr. Pierce."
I've been trying to reach you all day.
"Emma, listen."
The donor I talked to you about... her family is threatening to sue.
Her mother had religious objections... to harvesting her daughter's organs... even though her daughter was a voluntary donor.
"I don't think they have a case, but..."
Are you listening to me?
Her lawyer just called.
She needs to see you.
She needs to see how her daughter's cornea... has changed your life.
"Because it has, Emma."
"Whether you like it or not, it has."
Where does she live?
Is this Leslie's?
"You're Russian, you go to a Russian church?"
Yes.
"Um, Davisovich is our ancestral name."
Where did Leslie work?
Illinois Masonic... on Wellington.
He is.
Best enjoy this while we can.
Hitler's got enough on his plate without picking a fight with us.
His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.
Will you be there this evening?
If I can get away.
"- Oh, do try and make it, Miriam."
Turning out in force to oppose Joyce's proposition is the only way to get it thrown out.
"Will you be there, Alison?"
Of course.
Boxing gloves on.
Granite chin at the ready.
Excellent.
You may well need it.
I suspect it could get rather bloody.
How was the check-up?
Fine.
- Good.
"What can I get you, Alison?"
- Some tongue would be lovely.
"Oh, I was expecting you back half an hour ago, Claire."
"I'm sorry, Mrs Cameron."
Bit of a queue at Brindsley's.
"And then, in the grocer's, a few of us were talking about tonight's meeting."
"As my employee, you'll appreciate that I expect you to vote in favour of my proposition tonight."
Staff loyalty is a quality that I hold in very high regard.
It's essential for a harmonious household.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
There's a list of chores on the kitchen table.
I'd like them completed by the time I return.
I'll be out all afternoon.
"Yes, Mrs Cameron."
I'm part of the external review of Operation Merlin.
"We allow Gould to stay in business, then we go after him."
"Now, what's that about?"
"Well, us allowing Gould some leeway for strategic reasons is information you might want to lose on your hard drive."
You're joking.
Knowledge is power in this game.
"Yeah, well, it does seem your boss had something of an ego."
Putting Gould away became an obsession for him.
It did seem that way to me at the time.
"Must have thought his name was Kevin Costner, not Simmonds."
- Have you seen that film?
- What film?
The Untouchables.
"Great film, it's a great film."
You should watch it.
Sean Connery.
"""They put one of ours in the hospital, we put one of theirs in the morgue. """
- Right.
- lain?
A light's just come on in the car.
It's like a green explanation mark.
- Probably needs a service.
- It's brand-new.
Thanks for your time.
Nice house.
You want a hand buttoning up?
One of the few men I can trust not to grab my arse.
What's the deal with the Merlin undercover?
Risdale?
He unfortunately reminded me that knowledge is power.
Pack him off to Magaluf.
He can sell dodgy pills from his bar with the rest of the bent coppers.
Nami's not after money.
- She did it because she trusted me.
- So you say.
Your image is very appealing.
"And you have such a nice body, too."
Nowadays there is not much excitement in this industry.
It's so boring.
Did you give my number to anyone?
Why?
I've been getting a lot of perverted telephone calls lately.
Is there a pervert stalking you?
"Such a lonely world, isn't it?"
Everyone wants someone to talk to.
That sad looking guy outside as well.
He looks like a guy who's henpecked at home.
Are you sympathizing with a pervert!
?
"No, but I read these stories in the magazines so often nowadays, how some women have been assaulted or had their underwear stolen."
Do you have a persecution complex?
You might be the type.
I think I'll be going now.
"OK, I understand."
Why don't you take that magazine with you as a memento?
"Ladies and gentlemen, this train is leaving, please mind the doors,"
Nami Tsuchiya.
Please come out.
I just want to talk to you.
Who are you?
Say something.
I saw you in front of the cafe.
Why did you follow me?
"I sympathize with you, and I don't know why I'm doing this."
No.
They're not funny at all!
"Oh, hello Dick."
- Hello Ben.
I'm waiting for Mary.
I'm sleeping with Mary.
Oh.
Okay.
"So from what I've heard, you're quite the professor funnypants."
"Well, I.."
- It's seems that you have Mary wrapped around your little funny bone.
"But I can assure you, I am a far tougher... bone wrapperer"
I think I'll wait outside.
Make me laugh funny man.
"Well, I'm not a comedian."
"It's just that funny things, just seem to happen to me."
"Oh really, like what?"
"Well, like last week, I was at a bus stop, and it suddenly started raining, pouring."
"And I look over and I see this gorgeous grad student, and she's looking at me, like a kid with braces, looking at a candy apple."
"Mmm, no, not funny."
"Well, I'm about to say hello, when I suddenly realize, that my hair has flipped forward."
"Here I am standing in the rain, with my very own awning."
"Well, finally the bus arrived, and the door opened, the compressor kicked in, and this, this, European weave of mine got sucked right into the bus!"
"Well, there I was, in front of this beautiful girl, and chasing that bus, and chasing my hair.."
"up and down, chasing!"
And I couldn't..
I just.. oh!
Oh!
Oh!
This is not good.
"Yes, Yes, it is!"
The bus stole your hair!
-Shh!
- I can't hear anything.
-Quiet.
Logopolis has stopped.
And I was vain enough to think it was me he was after.
Logopolis is his target.
Turn that machine off.
You have no idea what you're doing.
"Merely emitting a sound-cancelling wave, Monitor."
Logopolis is now temporarily suspended.
The silence gives us an opportunity to discuss its future.
There will be no future.
"You are eroding structure, generating entropy."
An absurd assertion.
I know the power of this device down to the last decibel.
But you do not know Logopolis!
"But I shall, shan't I?"
When you tell me of the secret work you're doing here.
I cannot tell you.
Why have you created a copy of the Pharos Project?
"Hmm, the time has come for you to share your secret with me."
No!
No one must know.
That has been our firm decision.
"Very well, we'll wait until you change it."
Patience is a particular virtue of mine.
Father.
That's not your father.
"Tremas is dead, murdered by him, the Master."
Nyssa.
You killed my father?
But his body remains useful.
You want to go on pretending to be the brother he's never heard of?
We were getting somewhere.
Then get somewhere honestly.
As his father.
Honesty?
Is that what this is?
"You just want me to make good with my FBI agent son so he doesn't go tell them about it and they come close this little science project, and then bam!"
There goes your cure.
I know you didn't throw yourself off that bridge.
Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard would never walk off that bridge.
Damn straight he wouldn't.
But Sheriff Jimmy Pritchard ended up all by himself in a crappy apartment paying for hookers.
Watch it.
And getting visits from his son only when the neighbors complained about the noise and cigarette smoke.
He knows who you are.
Show him who you can be.
I've seen that person.
"I think Duval should see him, too."
You done?
Yes.
You ever think about coaching sports?
That was a humdinger of an underdog speech.
There's only one way back into Duval's life.
He asked me for help once.
Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.
"And when he asked for your help, what did you do?"
Gracie:
"Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here."
[Chuckles]
Does my dad know you're here?
"No, he doesn't."
"You know, I'm not a kid."
I found it.
You'd better look your intern ass I found it!
And I found something along with it too:
"Errors, major ones."
Errors that we cannot afford to make.
- Like what?
"- Honey... we are not at ""Harper's Bazaar""."
The big boss down the hall would not be thrilled.
She'd be very glad that I had a spare moment... to oversee this...
"this ""work""."
"I delegated this project to you because I thought you could... handle it, unfortunately, I've learned you can't."
"Re-typing my rolodeck was just that difficult task for you, huh?"
For example:
Lann Wayner's card.
"Why is there only one ""n""on lann?"
"Did you know he added an extra ""n"" years ago?"
"Andy Warhol's card, did you even think to verify this number?"
"- No, because he's dead."
- Excuses!
"You just don't get it, do you?"
"Dead or alive, I still... need their phone numbers."
"This is for your own benefit, not mine, okay?"
No bad blood?
It's curse!
Dolly!
You're back from the couture show!
How is Lacroix?
"That is Dolly Bellows, she's an institution."
- Give me a tissue.
- That man is a genius!
The word genius is really in overuse
Lacroix transcends the English language.
Keep it there.
This tells your temperature.
"When the red light goes on, that's your temperature."
I'll run it!
[Regan humming]
A disorder of the nerves.
At least we think it is.
We don't know yet exactly how it works.
It's often seen in early adolescence.
"She shows all the symptoms-- hyperactivity, quick temper, performance in math."
"Yeah, why the math?"
What is that?
It affects her concentration.
Uh-huh.
Now this is for ritalin.
10 milligrams a day.
Is it like a tranquilizer?
It's a stimulant.
A stimulant?
"My God, she's higher than a kite now."
The condition isn't quite what it seems.
Nobody knows the cause of hyperkinetic behavior in a child.
Ritalin seems to work to relieve the condition.
"As to how or why, we really don't know."
But the symptoms could be overreaction to depression.
That's out of my field.
My daughter isn't depressed.
"Well, you mentioned her father and the separation."
Do you think I should take her to a psychiatrist?
No.
I think we should wait and see what happens with the ritalin.
I think that's the answer.
How could I?
I didn't hold a grudge against you either.
I could never hold a grudge against you.
- How's life?
Are you happy?
- I am.
Happy that you became a famous artist.
What you always wanted... and what you truly deserved to be.
"Yet, I often wondered if this is worth of being alone in life."
"'Artists should never get married,' eh?"
Remember?
I always do.
"Everything was so beautiful then, the penthouse..."
the hole in the blanket!
The pot with our one and only sovereign!
I broke the pot and the sovereign was counterfeit.
Counterfeit?
The sovereign we swore on our love never to spend was... counterfeit!
"But our love was real, Pavlos."
And my portrait?
what became of my portrait?
"It's the only thing I have from you, Aliki."
I never sold this portrait.
"It's always been in the penthouse, over my bed."
When I feel lonely...
disheartened...
I talk to that portrait as if it was alive and listening.
"I tell her... my dreams, my worries, my bitter sorrows..."
Whatever I say... she'll always answer...
I love you!
"I love you, too!"
"We lost track of time, Pavlos."
Is there a listing for implosion grenades?
- Those were the days.
"- Artie, we've got WiFi."
"- No, no, no, I like paper."
"Actually, I hate paper."
"But, you know, it's a security issue."
"Okay, Artie, enough."
You have to fill us in.
"Okay, if the competition used an implosion grenade to steal the sword,"
Then what the hell does this sword do?
Yeah.
"I mean, it must be pretty major, right?"
You don't drop a nuclear bomb to steal a butter knife.
Exactly.
Okay.
You want to know about the sword?
I'll tell you about the sword.
"The Honjo Masamune is much, much more than a dull knife."
It kept the ruling Shogunate in power for hundreds of years
By making them invincible in battle.
And the beauty in the way these things were forged.
"I mean, ritually hammered and folded."
The blade millions of layers of steel
With a carbon content that's right off the charts.
And each layer only atoms--atoms--thick.
I mean this sword...
Is said to be perfectly aligned.
- So what does it do?
- Yeah.
"Um, ha, uh..."
"Okay, you know how geese fly in a ""v"" formation"
And the wind hits the first bird and then splits
England.
Not Birmingham.
The British bobby cannot be bought.
"- You, shut your face."
- Sorry.
- What are you offering?
- Nothing.
You must speak to my lawyer.
"What, old pervy Spurty?"
Ho-ho-ho!
Ha-ha-ha!
"Right now, everything seems to be in order here."
"I would stand by you, Richie, but lost causes depress me."
Toodly-woodly.
"Right, Spurty, do your stuff."
"Your Honour, I wandered into a garden, under the impression it was my garden."
"On seeing items of women's laundry hanged on the line,"
I naturally assumed that my wife had done some washing and I began to get it in for her.
"The fact that I live in a high-rise flat and am not married is circumstantial evidence and, hence, inadmissible."
Right.
"Well, we'd better escape."
Against Leon Brittan's law and order initiative?
Never!
No choice.
"The meat is in my trousers, Tarby is coming round to hear his golfing anecdote and you're banged up in the slammer."
Don't be disgusting.
I've never been banged up the slammer.
You're right.
We've gotta escape.
I have a plan.
What we have to do is set up a complicated system of stooges to find out exactly what the guards are up to.
"Then, we dig three tunnels and hide the dirt in our trousers."
Medication?
You want to put my daughter on medication because she interrupted your stupid story about a jungle gym on your head?
!
That's it!
I'm taking it off!
Aah!
Ladies!
"Please, stop!"
"Everyone else, there's spinach and artichoke dip in a bread bowl."
There's something about strong women that just gets me going.
"Again, that's my mother and my grandmother."
You're a lucky man.
"Oh, my God."
I cupped your boob.
- Attacked and fondled?
- Didn't fondle.
Aye!
The dip is delicious.
"Hey, Greg."
How are you?
How's your holiday going?
"Normally, I go upstairs and smooth things over, but this time, I can't."
Your mother would assume I was there to bed her.
"Well, I'm not going up there."
She was completely out of line with Anna-Kat.
"I agree the timing was way off, but it really wasn't that terrible."
It's not like Dr. Ellie hasn't suggested medication for Anna-Kat before.
I am not willing to go down that road until we've exhausted all the other roads.
"I totally agree with you, but it's there for us if we feel like she needs it."
"Because the singing in your head, from what we've seen today..."
not effective.
My mom just wants to drug Anna-Kat so she doesn't have to deal with her.
"-Denise, I owe you big."
There's government agents in your room right now.
Somehow they knew we were there.
Any idea how?
-Yes.
"- Alright, We're gonna have to ditch this car and hitch a ride into Albuquerque,"
- What's in Albuquerque?
- A friend.
"Whatever it is you're not telling me, Jaelen, I need to know."
We're running out of time.
-I was compelled by her.
I began experiencing feelings I never had before.
As if I were meant to find her.
I felt myself avoiding better judgment that this was wrong.
A forbidden code of conduct in my task here.
"I allowed it to happen, I wanted it to happen."
Andromedans enforce a very structured mating ritual.
A choice for companion is never our own and never random.
We're conditioned this way from birth.
Therefore there is never the opportunity for...
-Falling in love?
-Yes.
- But did she know the truth about you?
-I didn't have the time.
"But I couldn't stay in one place for to long, so the day approached when I had to tell her."
I haven't been entirely honest with you.
-What do you mean?
-There are people looking for me.
- Who's looking for you?
Do you need any help?
-I'm not from here.
"I'm not from Los Angeles, and I'm not from the United States."
House computer.
You require?
"You've allowed access to my private lift, to whom?"
A visitor.
Top priority.
What are you...
No sign of him?
"In the first days of the occupation, this was always our meeting point, but maybe he stopped coming."
Don't you have any other way of contacting him?
"I mean, you just turn up here at this time of day?"
It seems a bit haphazard.
We didn't have time to get organised.
"What, so you've no contact with other resistance units?"
None.
Maybe mine's the only column still fighting.
There's Leitz now.
These are friends.
"Dayna, Tarrant."
They're from Earth.
Enemies of the Federation.
- Have you any news of the other columns?
- Nothing good.
Two has been practically wiped out.
One and Three have suffered heavy casualties and pulled back into the White Mountains to regroup.
So mine is the only unit still functioning.
And you can expect to come under heavy attack in the next few days.
The General is getting impatient.
"Yes, well, we beat off their last attack."
Shot down two gunships.
I heard.
- How did you get into the city?
- I swam in under the reactors.
"- I didn't get a chance to contribute a whole lot to that report, I mean anything"
- Is this true?
Lindsay?
"Look, guys, good science requires teamwork."
Part of the assignment is working together.
- If we had different partners.
"- I'm keeping you together, and giving you an additional assignment, which you'll do together"
"Or fail, together."
"Oh, yeah, you're not stupid at all."
"Uh, a little help here."
I think I'm going to have a hernia.
I had a hernia when I was little once.
I had to have an operation.
"Seth, can you...?"
!
"Oh, oh, sorry, sorry."
Okay.
My leg just went numb.
"My legs went numb, but we're cool."
"That's okay, right?"
That's normal?
- You are so out of your element.
"- No, I'm not."
- What are you even doing here?
- I need tickets.
I'll do anything to get them.
"- What are you, like, a huge fan?"
"- Yeah, of a certain prickly brunette named after my least favorite season."
- You're doing this for a girl?
"- Well, to be clear, I'm actually getting the tickets for her and her boyfrien..."
Her boy... her friend that's a boy.
- I'm showing her that I'm capable of thinking of somebody other than myself.
"So, if I say to you:"
"- ""What are they doing here?"""
- Treasure hunting!
We might have problems.
"No, we won't."
The road and the film
One thing I often try to do in my films is to keep in mind my first impressions of a new region.
My first meetings with the people of the region.
I try to remember what happened on the day I arrived
in a new village.
How did people react?
How did I see them?
"Familiarity is not a good thing, when you get to know a region, you get used to it."
"I worked there for six months,"
"I knew it like my own back yard, but I had to recapture my first impressions."
The way I saw the people and the way they saw me.
I'll ask.
Ask that one.
Ask her.
"Good morning, Madam."
"Good morning, I am honoured."
How do we get to Siah Dareh?
"Turn left at the fork, it's 200 meters further on."
Thank you.
Goodbye.
The mourning rituals with the traditional self-mutilation of the face only exist in two regions of Iran.
In Lorestan and Kurdistan.
I went to Kurdistan first.
I found this remote village and I started to work.
"I would say, in a film, finding the location is one of the"
most important parts of the Director's job.
The location is as important as the characters in a film.
It's backfiring in the cockpit block!
Shut down bypass.
Removing cockpit block!
Hang on there!
This baby's never had a person on board.
It's just a little nervous.
Take your time and figure out why the pressure's rising.
"Yes, but..."
Take care of it.
Brother...
Is there anything you value more than yourself?
Something I value?
It's to save...
This world!
Result code is timed out!
It's overflowing!
Abort experiment!
Disconnect all circuits!
There's a crack in the chamber!
It's too late!
I didn't understand why he wanted to be on Dangaioh.
That's why I wanted to be on it.
So I could see for myself.
I can understand how your brother felt...
"He said, ""something more valuable than yourself,"" right?"
Uh-huh.
"That's why I'm here, too."
I'm glad you finally decided.
I'm very grateful.
"Because you agreed, our mighty States can now gain the power we need to exercise justice!"
The power to prepare us for the coming threat!
"The power you seek, namely, the power they are going to grant you, will not make you into a mighty soldier."
Why did Curtis McNeal believe that you know who killed his wife and who kidnapped yours?
I -- even met the man.
It was a dying utterance.
The courts give those weight for a reason.
The man killed himself.
"Obviously, he was unstable."
"All right, your son lied, your daughter ran, and now you're stonewalling me-- if I don't get complete cooperation from your family-- now--"
Sara's going to end up as dead as Amanda McNeil.
Or maybe that doesn't bother you.
"If I knew anything that would help find Sara,"
I'd tell you.
"Plausible deniability might work in Washington, but it's not going to help you in a criminal investigation."
Mom.
I told you not to come.
You want me to leave?
No.
Come here.
Why are you staying here under a different name?
You didn't tell anyone.
No.
I want to know what's going on.
Why is the FBI looking for you?
"Max, Max, sit down."
The FBI probably wants to talk to me because I said some nasty things about your father.
"Well, then just talk to them."
Get it over with.
It's a little more complicated than that.
Sara's missing and Dad's a wreck.
"If you know something, tell me."
"You know, the worst thing about the divorce wasn't losing your father."
It was losing Marcy and you.
Mom...
- What can you afford?
"100 a year to their mother is better than losing 1,500 at once."
Should she live longer than 15 years we'd be completely taken in.
People live forever when an annuity is to be paid them.
"20 now and then will amply discharge my promise, you're right."
I'm convinced that your father had no idea of giving them money.
- They will have 500 a year.
- What more could they want for?
"No housekeeping, carriage, horses, few servants, keeping no company..."
How comfortable!
They will be much more able to give you something.
Marianne.
can you play something else?
Mamma has been weeping since breakfast.
I meant something less mournful.
A visitor in my own home!
It is not to be borne.
Elinor.
"- Mamma, we have nowhere to go."
- John and Fanny will be here soon.
Do you expect me to be here to welcome them?
Vultures!
I will start making inquiries for a new house at once.
"Until then, we must try to bear their coming."
"Margaret, are you there?"
"Come down, John and Fanny will be here soon."
Why are they to live at Norland?
They have a house in London.
"Houses go from father to son, not father to daughter."
It is the law.
"- Come, we'll play with your atlas."
- It's not mine.
"Up till last night, they only hit empty houses."
"But when they stumbled across Colin's girlfriend, they beat her unconscious."
Now you're just trying to scare me.
Can you help me out?
Take another look at this sketch for me.
"You should ask my friend, Vicki."
She had some stuff taken a few months ago.
"I never reported it, but they took a bracelet, three rings and my GFGD shirt."
Thank you.
Is that a band?
Fashion.
It's one of a kind.
A gift from a designer.
Vagabond chic.
"Retail, how much is that worth?"
"2000, maybe."
So when exactly were the items stolen?
March 9th.
It was Chelsea's birthday.
We got kicked out of Mondrian.
"Then she threw a drink at her ex at Avalon, the ridiculous one with the reality show, K.K."
"When I got home, I was packing for London to go visit my parents when I realized the shirt was gone."
Why didn't you report it then?
"Well, I was going to London."
Do you realize there's probably a dozen more Vickis out there who don't even know they've been ripped off?
Burglary's still burglary and Miranda's not Vicki.
"So how do you fence a $2000, one-of-a-kind T-shirt?"
First you got to find somebody willing to wear it.
"But if you do, they're gonna want to wear it where they can be noticed."
I'm thinking this T-shirt needs its own Facebook page.
Yes.
Have you seen me?
One should go to the nearest temple of any kind in a moment of weakness.
Maybe I shouldn't hurry about Moloch?
"Wise Solomon, people believe in your fairness."
Don't let doubts poison your grand design.
"The law will protect you from your enemies, because what you believe in will always become law."
"King, here are the petitioners from the city!"
Great King!
You're building a temple for pagan filth.
"New sacrifices will bring not glory, but fear."
The treasury has already paid for the building of the altar to Moloch.
Temples are expensive nowadays.
I'm decorating this city to glorify it.
Great King!
"There are madmen, who being blind, will worship the new idol."
Get him out of here!
Don't build the altar to Moloch!
The pagan filth will destroy you and all of us!
Glory to wise Solomon!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
Hurray!
What was there will go on.
What has been done will be done again.
There is nothing new under the sun.
Hurray to our King!
Hurray to our King!
"Have you come to your senses, you son of a bitch?"
Where am I?
What are you babbling?
Wait.
Let him drink a bit.
We won't tell anyone about it.
"Come on, dude."
The line is moving.
It's been half an hour.
There are extra classes at school on Saturday and Sunday.
We have to come to school 5 days a week and stay behind for extra lessons 3 times.
"Besides this, you still have a lot to catch up with from past years."
I've made a list of books that you should buy.
Be sure to get them as soon as possible.
"Preparation for Student Selection Exam, The Exam Questions of the last... 10 years, Writing Guide, Turkish Texts 1, Applied Math 2..."
Dictionary of Idioms.
What's all this?
Perfect for a start.
We should get started in an easy mode.
Easy?
Yes.
I got the Lotto Papers.
What do we do now?
Fill it out right away.
We don't have much time left.
Hold on a second.
Let's catch our breath.
You have a maximum of one minute for each question.
Pay attention to the questions.
The choices are full of tricks.
Which of the options below is not meant in this paragraph?
Which of the following is not even there at all?
Be careful with negative and reverse questions.
They will do their best to make us fail.
Bastards!
I never knew there were so many tricks involved.
I'm exhausted.
Let's sit down somewhere for a few minutes.
I heard that.
Hey you're not supposed to be talking while you're driving!
Well I already lost Jesse to Hannah.
And now I can't go to college.
Because I was busy selling out stadiums.
And meeting the Queen of England.
Instead of holding a spit bucket for the girls wrestling team!
Ow!
Look I know.
I was really thinking about this.
You know what if you said you were Hannah Montana's assistant?
I mean that way you still did all the stuff but as her assistant.
You couldn't have thought of that 200 miles ago?
"[Singing to the tune of ""On the Road Again""]"
In the car again.
Miley Stewart's back in the car again.
Driving places she has already been.
Miley's arriving back to school again.
Yee-haw!
Today our topic is heartbreak and disappointment.
Who out there has lost a boyfriend recently or a good friend.
Or maybe didn't get into the college they wanted to get into?
I.
Nice try honey.
I'm a visual manifestation of your over-stressed subconscious.
And I'm with you for the next 200 miles.
So you're a mess.
Let's start from there.
Hannah Montana's assistant?
That sounds fascinating.
Why didn't you include that in your application?
Miss Montana likes me to keep it very low profile.
-Do you see him here in this courtroom?
-Yes.
Will you please point him out for the jury?
"Let the record show that Mr. Hill identified the defendant, James Conway."
Do you also know a man named Paul Cicero?
-Do you see him in the courtroom?
-Yes.
Can you point him out for the jury?
Let the record show Mr. Hill identified the defendant Paul Cicero.
I have a document....
The hardest thing was leaving the life.
I still loved the life.
We were treated like movie stars with muscle.
We had it all just for the asking.
"Our wives, mothers, kids, everybody rode along."
I had paper bags filled with jewelry stashed in the kitchen.
I had a sugar bowl full of coke next to the bed.
People call them rats because they will do anything to survive.
-Objection!
-Objection sustained.
-l know nothing about being a rat.
-You know everything about it!
Anything I wanted was a phone call away.
Free cars.
Keys to a dozen hideout flats all over the city.
I'd bet 20 grand over a weekend then blow the winnings in a week or go to sharks to pay back the bookies.
Didn't matter.
It didn't mean anything.
When I was broke I would go rob some more.
We ran everything.
We paid off cops.
We paid off lawyers.
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"- Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
- Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
- That's right.
"- It'll be very dirty, because he strictly forbade me to go in and clean it."
"I wasn't going to charge him a cent, but..."
"Don't worry, I'll take care of that."
- Shall I give you the key?
- Yes.
I'll see if I can find it.
Have you seen him?
Yes.
And how is he?
Fine.
The poor thing didn't even have any luck in jail.
He got very little publicity.
"Not one lousy television came here, nor one lousy paparazzi."
"With all the trashy shows there are, not one bothered to come and interview me."
"It's sad the state of the ""masses-media"" in this country."
"Yes, you're right."
- The keys...
"Always ask yourself, are there any hidden carbohydrates in the food you eat."
Watch fried foods.
"Now, whenever you do anything strenuous, check your pulse."
Do deep breathing exercises.
"Stay away from starches and sugars, and that's it."
"Now, if you will also supplement... with twice the adult minimum daily vitamin requirements... and do six and a half minutes of isometrics every day, it's easy, Bob."
Wouldn't it be easier if I just stopped eating?
"Yeah, that might work too."
"Hi, honey."
"- Hi, dear."
How'd it go with Dr. Klein?
"- Oh, fine."
Fine.
Good.
Any change since your last physical?
No.
Everything's fine.
"Oh, great."
"You want a drink before dinner, honey?"
No.
"Well, there's some fruit, if you wanna munch."
No munching.
"Bob, Is there something you're not telling me?"
"Well, I just have to go on a little diet."
I have to start counting the calories and... try to get rid of that.
"Oh, that?"
"Honey, that's just a little happy fat."
I think it's cute.
"Emily, fat isn't cute unless you're nine months old and you're playing with a Busy Box."
"Well, it shouldn't be hard to lose three or four pounds."
"- Uh, eight pounds."
- Eight?
Tony...
He's the owner of the delicatessen.
Saying that the voice was a mars.
"But, the below average height and the fact that the voice was disguised and it was muffled by the mask..."
All indicate at least the possibility of a doubt as to the gender.
"The lab is going to be running some more tests on that makeup, so I'll report tomorrow."
"You should be on salary, sir, with these hours."
I feel I am.
Good working with you.
Thank you.
(COLUMBO HUMMING)
(KNOCKING)
(CONTINUES HUMMING)
(CLEARS THROAT)
"I guess I just got carried away, sir."
I hope you don't mind.
"No, no."
It's all right.
"These shoes, sir, they're really terrific."
"Now I know why, Lieutenant Lucerne, he always look so tall."
"Yes, well, I would appreciate a certain amount of discretion in that matter, Lieutenant."
"Public image, you know."
"Oh, right, sir."
"Oh, well, you don't have to worry about a thing, sir."
"As far as I'm concerned, you're four inches taller than I am."
And that's the end of it.
"Thank you, Lieutenant Columbo."
"My pleasure, Lieutenant Lucerne."
"Sir, I got the second lab report on the mask, so I hurried right over."
Yes?
"It turns out that it probably isn't a woman, sir."
"You see, it was actor's makeup."
"You know, force them to hand it over."
- We're not even sure if...
- One more round of betting and
- I'm cashing us out.
- You're the boss.
I was just trying to keep her distracted.
We're clear.
I want him.
- Sorry?
- You follow the girl.
I'll stay here and I'll call you if he comes out.
- Are you sure?
- I can handle him if there's trouble.
All right.
- I'll call you if I catch anything.
- Do that.
"Artie, I know you're not as sure about this as you're pretending."
I'm not pretending.
You know when you hold a mirror up to a second mirror and you get that sort of reflected infinity thing?
What happens if that mirror is reflected and it's something like the Studio 54 disco ball?
Is it possible to get some kind of artifact interaction?
Something completely unexpected?
I don't know.
What if the disco ball goes off and someone is standing in front of the Alice's mirror?
I think we know what happens.
Do we really?
- Could reflections switch places?
- Could people?
She pulls to the right.
Pardon?
I noticed it a couple months ago.
"When Myka's mad at me, she pulls to the right."
"Ganz, I've got your man."
Shrubbery and ground's all in good shape.
- What rent is it bringing in?
- Just enough to pay the taxes.
But it's a valuable property.
"Surely, you could loan me 15,000 on it."
"You know, Douglas it was father's wish that you keep the place."
"Yes, I know."
"I hate to take a chance on losing it, it's all I have left."
But I've got to have the money.
But the theater business is an outright gamble.
Anything is a gamble to a fellow who doesn't know his oats.
But I think I know something about the theater.
There's a wide difference between college plays and Broadway productions.
"But one has to start somewhere, and there doesn't seem to be any room for me at the bottom."
So I'll start at the top.
"Alright, take your positions, girls."
Music.
[piano music]
Come ahead.
"Wait a minute, where's Gambarelli?"
She's supposed to enter with her father.
(male #1) 'She's coming.'
"Well, tell her to hurry up, Mr. Ganz is waiting."
I'm afraid you won't get much idea of the number this way.
We expect it to be one of the highlights of the show.
"Chowsky, explain how you're putting it on."
"With pleasure, Mr. Ganz."
"The setting is a magnificent art saloon with terrific big pictures all around, very lovely."
Gambarelli is coming with her father to sell his paintings.
I see.
"Visualize it, Tyler."
I was trying to piece together what happened that night she disappeared.
- He helped me fill in the blanks.
- What blanks?
He reminded me that I'd stopped by his dressing room during the intermission.
Reminded you?
You don't remember?
"Well, it was the first night back from the tour."
"Everything was so hectic, I..."
Did he remind you what you talked about?
Why are you taking this sarcastic tone with me?
Because it sounds like he was planting a false memory in your mind in order to come up with an alibi for himself.
An alibi?
Why would...
You think Philip killed her.
You are insane!
I can't listen to this.
I can't!
Planted memory.
Maybe we can turn it into probable cause.
"I'm warning you, doctor, if you faint, I'm not responsible."
I'll try to control myself.
"By the way, your production of Aida five years ago, one of the best nights of my life."
Lennie Briscoe took me.
Do you know how many singers I've led in that role?
"Tebaldi, Price, Milanov, Caballe."
What's this underneath the makeup?
A boil or something.
Looks like a bite mark.
- Human bite.
- That's not possible.
Don't move.
I need to take a photo.
But if you deal with something else steadily meanwhile...
This is totally vainness.
Waste of time.
"I learned it on the front at my own crew, what the fact that somebody finds the time to think means."
"The one like this becomes the plaything of their own thought and they are due so then, than Tót lord."
The red one is spotted with a butterfly.
"I get true one in everything the respected for major lord, but I believe it so, it is not possible to prevent it if something wants to occur to the man."
But could be.
Why not could be.
It is necessary to modify the circumstances only.
And this our start goes by.
What there is an obstacle to this?
You understand it the thought procession?
I believe it yes.
Well...
I do not take something here and there yet.
"Me, too only here and there."
"Oh, be thinking now, Tót."
"Well, Tót?"
Did something occur to you already?
Yes.
Now.. something...
But no.
"You like thinking though, Tót."
It is an occasion here now.
"Here you go, Tót."
There is time now.
"You think onto our Gyula and strain the your sluggish brain, my good Lajos."
Do not whisper Ágika!
"I do not whisper, major lord."
"Unbutton your jacket, if some more comfortable."
- Maybe then now.
Fantastic.
A truly great sleep.
"On the scale of one to five - 5,429,562."
Sleeping face down in the toilet is conducive to restful slumber?
And why shouldn't I sleep in the lavatory?
You wet the bed.
Once.
I had a nightmare that I was ordinary and untalented and there was a momentary aberration.
It's a sign of an extra-vivid subconscious.
It's a sign of an extra-drippy tiddler.
"Eddie, I was having a nightmare that I was a pleb."
It was a horrifying experience.
I remember the night so well.
I awoke to hear Richie screaming into the middle of the night.
"""Ah. "" His heart-rending sobs echoing round the house."
"Why, you wept like a soul in torment."
"I rushed in to find poor, frightened Richie shivering, terrified, white, sitting in a puddle."
"- Yes, and what did you do?"
- I don't remember.
You switched on my electric blanket.
Only to take your mind off the nightmare.
You completely electrocuted my love truncheon.
Love truncheon?
"Love pencil, more like."
"Well, love pin, actually."
"Eddie, what's this?"
- I don't know.
- It's one of my scary looks.
Is it really?
My intimidating frown.
So you just watch out.
Has the hair grown back yet?
You guys are harassing me because of Facebook?
That T-shirt has 3400 friends and six people posted pictures of you wearing it tonight.
Apparently it's one of a kind.
From like a three-year-old collection.
"I got it from this Asian girl, Kai, I'd seen around the clubs."
She was at that place on Sunset Plaza next to Chin Chin.
She had these shopping bags full of clothes.
I just really wanted it.
Chelsea-Colin photos have hit the Web.
"""Robbery Love Triangle."""
I ran DMV for Asian girls named Kai in the right age and weight range.
Our girl in the stolen T-shirt picked this one.
Kai Ng.
Hmm.
Say our crew flagged Colin and Chelsea at The Edison.
"Stands to reason if Kai was one of the burglars, she'd be at The Edison too."
Sounds like we should talk to the guy that took that photo.
I shoot HD video.
It's revolutionary.
"I sell stills, video, I get it all, I miss nothing."
There.
There's your girl.
Nice-looking blonde.
Part of the gang?
Show him the sketch.
What about this guy?
You ever see him?
Sure.
I know ten boys look just like him.
"Come with me to Mother Lode, I'll find you 20."
"What about this, what if we gave you a list of the other victims, could you see if you have footage of any of them on the nights their homes were robbed?"
You would give me a first dibs call on future break-ins?
It's so strange.
We've been to every hospital and he's in none of them.
It's like his mind's a blank.
He probably conked out somewhere.
- Don't listen to him.
- We'll find Tony for sure.
"Yeah, we'll turn the town upside down."
Yeah.
- What're you doing?
- Thinking.
"Thinking about us in a different place, such as..."
Las Vegas with Tony.
"Seven or eleven every time, right?"
A day at the races.
All the long shots come in.
"You do have an imagination, after all."
The possibilities with Tony are unlimited.
"For example, he stacked the wine casks by just looking at them."
"If he can stack them, he can unstack them."
The gold is on display at the museum.
Protected by an impenetrable security system.
Just sitting there waiting for us to penetrate it.
Wait a minute.
Us?
You mean Gannon said it's ok to use the control on Tony?
Professor Gannon is extremely busy being a genius.
"I own half the invention,"
"Half of Tony, that means I own half of the profits."
"So far, the return on my investment has been half of zero."
What about security.
We'd need an army to pull it off.
We'll have an army with us!
"Oh, God."
So inappropriate.
Can you quit staring at me like I'm a hot fudge sundae?
"- Got a boyfriend, little sis?"
- You got a girlfriend?
"I did, but we broke up."
Tell me about it.
"Well, maybe I can help you get back with her."
"Boss, I'm at Makani's address."
"When I badged him, he tried to rabbit."
"Okay, come over here."
Didn't get real far.
What did he tell you about Dawkins?
Makani runs a fake ID mill out of the back of his shop.
Dawkins was in here about an hour ago.
He picked up a driver's license and a passport under the name of Carl Isner.
Update H.P.D. on the new alias.
Make sure Homeland Security adds it to their no-fly list.
Do you always have to walk so fast?
That's Dawkins' girlfriend.
"Uh, you know, um, your sister, she, uh, wasn't what I expected."
"I mean, aside from her hereditary aversion to neckwear, she seemed to be cool."
Are you saying I'm not cool?
"Well, in certain situations, like when you got a gun pointing in your face, or trying to decide whether to cut the blue wire or the red wire, you're good."
"But human interaction, mammal to mammal, room for improvement."
- That's all I'm saying.
"- Thank you, Dr. Phil."
- Can I get you guys something?
"- Yeah, Walton Dawkins."
Excuse me?
"Well, yeah."
"First, Walton Dawkins, but then I would love some blueberry pancakes."
"Every single hair gone, one by one, from worrying-- worrying about getting you passes, worrying about protecting your rights."
"And now, for the first time in ten years, when he's got a chance to prove to his old buddies that he's a success, a master sergeant, he can't go to that reunion."
Why?
Because his own platoon is too cheap to raise a few meas...
"Corporal Henshaw, do not beg them."
Let them search their own soul.
"Just remember him with this head of hair, gone from worrying."
'Cause he's the kind of a sergeant that worries about his men day and night.
All we're asking is a measly few bucks.
"-Now, look, come on now."
-Come on...
-You got a couple of bucks.
-I tell you no!
I can't spare another truck!
But I need another truck.
This is an emergency.
Call the Automobile Club.
Very funny.
The garbage is piling up behind my kitchens.
What am I going to do?
Learn to cook;
you won't have so much garbage.
Why don't you turn blue?
"Oh, knock it off."
Hey...
"Well, this is a gay little sorority meeting."
Mother Bilko's little chickens got nothing to do?
"Hey, Sowici, hold it."
You may have some extra guys for KP any minute now.
"Now, listen, you meatheads..."
"Ernie, Ernie, I was just giving 'em tomorrow's work detail."
Work detail?
And my adventures in this life won't mean anything... because you will have seduced my soul... and drawn me into your world.
"Goodbye, Tom."
Has his weight been varying much here in jail?
I don't believe so.
It's stayed about the same.
- Do you know how tall he is?
- I ain't sure.
"All right, Tom."
Step out.
Up on the scales.
What's this for?
"I'm designing your gallows, Mr. Horn."
I've got to get the weights exactly right.
"If this thing works the way I designed it... you should fall absolutely straight, stop, and make a half-turn to the right."
- Will I be alive or dead?
- When?
When I make that half-turn to the right.
You should be dead.
Nobody wants to spring the trap on you.
Mr. Julian here is designing something special for us.
The trap is water operated.
"Christ, you ain't going to drown me, are you?"
No.
You just step onto the platform... and your weight will activate a water valve... that finally springs the trap.
"All right, step back inside."
Do I spring that trap myself?
Exactly.
Makes me feel like I'm committing suicide.
"You suppose that's what I've been doing all these years, Sam?"
"Don't ask me that, Tom."
Bring the scales.
"Come on, Mr. Julian."
Oh.
"Ah, we're almost done, aren't we, cock?"
"See you, mate."
Yeah.
You know what my first act will be when I run this country?
Make threesomes compulsory?
OK.
But my second act will be to abolish five-day weather forecasts and publicly execute those who give them.
Some might say extreme.
"No, Sunday night, some guy who believes he has a personality 'cause he wears a bow tie says,"
"'It's galoshes day Monday, folks!"
'
Then this lunatic pretends to tell me the weather for the next five days.
Folks might find this useful in the planning of a week.
"Well, folks would be deceived, because by Tuesday night, bow tie has changed his forecast for two of the five nights but won't admit it."
"Your point being if it's a five-day weather forecast, how come he changes his mind every night?"
"Clearly, he can't, you know."
Kill him.
"Compassionately, but yes."
I'm sorry but um...
"What have you come as, eh?"
What's the emergency?
Where's hero-sorry-tax boy?
I just abandoned him at Parliament House.
It was unbearable.
They want him to run.
"Oh, God, strike at my vitals."
What am I doing?
This is mad.
I should go.
"Come on, I just hauled my arse halfway across town."
I'm sorry.
"People tryin' to make an honest buck, weary travelers just lookin' for a bucket of wings, maybe an ice-cold beer."
You read the brochure.
I'm glad somebody did.
What's your point?
"My point, jefe, is that I doubt this place turns into a feeding' frenzy at midnight, am I right?"
This is a place of business.
Every syndicate from Chicago to Tampico's gotta be skimmin' a little cream off the top for you and your boys.
[ice rattles in drink]
"[Alice] Your Old Fashioned, Mr. Malvado."
"Anything else for you, handsome?"
"Nah, I think I'm good, Alice."
So where is Richard?
How the hell should I know?
Because hermanos know.
I just came back from seeing my own brother for the first time in eons.
Pobre pendejo thought he could hide from me.
"Was still the same filthy son of a bitch he always was, but I'd forgotten how strong that bond could be."
Like we shared something crudo in the blood.
Except I didn't come here to talk about Richard.
"Why did you come, Mr. Gecko?"
I came to make a deal.
[theme music plays] [engine revving]
"You know, we have a word for what you're doing."
We call it berrinche.
That's what little babies do when they want their mother's milk.
You had one job.
Make it through a dinner and don't piss him off.
He was saying stupid things.
So you go and corner his girlfriend?
- She's hiding something.
"- Oh, God."
She doesn't fuckin' matter!
"And this is my property, so police or no police, you're trespassing."
- Now what do you want?
- A man was killed last night not half a mile from here.
- Where were you?
"- ""Where were you?"""
Don't you be flimflamming with your penny-ante questions.
"You're not interested in where ""I"" was."
Very well.
Where was she?
She was locked up all night and nowhere near your dead man.
(Murdoch):
And why do you keep her caged?
To keep her safe.
It's in her own best interest.
"And charging admission to view her in a cage, is that also in her best interest?"
She's... paying her keep.
"- Mr. Travis, is it?"
- Aye.
You're coming with us to the Station House.
- I have no reason to.
- Do I have to arrest you?
- Come on!
- Don't lay your hands on me.
- (girl grunting)
- I'm doing nothing the law says I can't!
Unlawful confinement of a person or persons.
You're coming with us.
I finished my anatomy report on the unclaimed bank robber.
- Mrs. Braxton?
- Yes.
"I appreciated the opportunity, Dr. Ogden."
"Well, if you put what you learn to good use, her unfortunate death will not be for nothing."
They can pilot the bloody boat.
"They can lead the damn fleet, for all I care."
But Johnnie frees the propeller.
Hmm.
You're late.
I took the liberty of ordering.
Sorry.
"We have guests staying, friends from Poland."
Things are very bad in Europe.
"It's not exactly a picnic here, if you hadn't noticed."
You can't find a decent waiter in SoHo since Italy joined the war.
"They were all rounded up as so-called enemies of the state, apart from Geppetto over there, who almost certainly is a spy."
Cerberus!
- Ugh!
"Christ, a dead sheep?"
- Ugh.
"- Not strictly ration book, but Cerberus can't live on crusts and scraps."
Ugh...
Sophie's going to boil it up and make him some broth.
Lucky fellow.
"Well, perhaps your sister would like to start feeding me, too, unless, of course, you've actually found me some work."
"So, Baker's outline for the Dunkirk film, you read it?"
It rattles along rather better than one might have expected.
Johnnie's escape from the steel thrust of the German war machine.
The rescue of the dog was very good.
"Here, boy."
Here.
"No, no."
"No, not you, Cerberus."
"Of course, it all depends on who they're planning to cast as Rose."
Uncle Frank?
"""A shipwreck of a man""?"
The Baroness was his mistress once.
"It was said, yes."
"I am sure of it, but it is precisely to deprive me of this suspicion that Norbert maintained the evening."
"You must get out of the bath, Princess, or you will be late."
"No, little Nadine, wearing an opal bracelet is old fashioned."
I'll take this.
And this.
"This way, you look like the Holy Virgin."
I am neither one nor the other.
This syncopated melody which contrasts with the constant rythm of the drums is really exciting.
"To dance, perhaps, but it's not worth Mozart."
"Dear friend, one can love Mozart and jazz."
The only thing interesting you is religious music.
"Dear Mr Fandor, I devour your articles."
This Dollon case is very exciting.
So you like that much crime stories?
"Yes, when I do not live them."
"It's true, you have been visited by"
Fantômas in your bathtub a few years ago.
"Do not talk about it, especially tonight."
I hope that he will be hanged very soon.
"Dear princess, I think you should not provoke him."
Even in word.
To hell with him.
Do you believe in the devil?
His supreme skill is to convince people he doesn't exist.
- Sorry.
- You're hurt?
"Madam, I am confused."
Excuse me.
It is nothing at all.
I'll freshen up.
"Keep an eye on Dinamo, I do not want him complicating things."
"He knows something, inform me of all his movements, understood?"
Yes sir.
Go ahead.
"Well, very well."
"I see you have learned quickly, Adriana."
"Thank you, Madame."
"Remember no to think of what has happened, it was horrible, but it has passed."
"We cannot do anything for her now, let this be a lesson."
"Surely,it was one of those, crimes of passion."
"Go change, we must see the next designs."
"Good morning, Madame Rapee."
"Look, I admit no one to interrupt my work."
"So, if you are here to see your friend, it is best for you to leave, and dont come here again."
Allez!
"I am sorry, I do not know what friend you are talking about?"
She is talking about me.
"Ah, I see you got a job, I am glad."
"Yes, but not for long, If you do not leave immediatedly!"
"Ok, Madame, In reality, the only thing I wanted, was to interview the models."
"Are you une, police?"
Not exactly...
"They have undergone all kinds of questioning,"
"And I do not want the girls to be nervous with what happened, so leave!"
"In that case, please forgive me, I will bother you no more, Excuse me."
"Ok girls, lets go."
Diana?
who is it?
Dinamo.
I want to ask you some questions.
"Come in, the door is open."
"grab a drink, relax, I will be out soon."
"Hey,got another dna sample to test it's a rush job."
"So,should I put it in front of my other rush jobs?"
Yes.
"Okay,I'll make a rush-rush job, and I'll get right on it, unless I get a rush-rush-rush job."
"Thanks,abs."
"Hey,um,could you tell gibbs that I got the results back from rebecca's dna?"
It does not match the genetic material in finn'shorts.
That means we're... looking for third woman.
"Since you revisited the crime sce,"
I decided I want to revisit the body.
Something's troubling me.
"Me,too."
"Uh-huh.What's that,tony?"
"Well,finn had two entrees and still had room for dessert."
"Makes me wonder if there was anything, you know,special about him."
Like what?
Oh...
like that.
did he have extra women because he had sething extra for the women?
"Well,take a look for yourself."
"sadly,the first thing the maggots eat is the soft tissue."
"Still,you've given me an idea."
To vomit?
"No,to reexamine the soft tissu thanks,tony."
I do what I can.
"ducky,is there any way to... psychologically un-see something?"
"Finn's bag contained 120 ounces of gold worth about $78,400 at today's conversion rate."
Nt numbers?
Tracing 'em now-- the coins were purchased over the internet in three batches.
I should have the dates here in a moment.
"Figured $60,000 came from the fiancees, and finn must have tossed in the rest."
officer david.
Forgive me of holding you up.
What has happened to you?
I was collecting the mail.
"Dear Mr. Brass, I am Rosella and I saw some of the films,... not in the cinema, but in the tapes, which Gianni my husband,... brings home and which we watch together."
"I am 33 years old and think of myself as as a normal woman,... far faway from damsels and their works."
"However, something incredible happened to me, which seems... impossible of having occured."
Perhaps that's why...
I write.
"I was angry with my husband, because he would stay... at work at the clinic at night and not... take me out for dinner as agreed."
I had my outing organised.
I took the children to... mama and did not prepare dinner.
You could have told me before.
"Sorry, it is not my fault."
"We are going out to dinner another day,... besides, I am tired."
-It's always the same!
First the rest and finally your wife.
"-Not so, I apologised."
-You are a specialist at that.
Thus you never bring it on.
You only care for yourself.
Everything must turn around you and get done your way.
The others do not count.
"For you I am just a housewife,... and your maid."
"Enough, Rosella."
I visited the sick all day long.
I am tired.
And you create problems over nothing.
Stop being so hysterical.
Bye!
I cannot say any more in here.
Talk to me at home.
When you have calmed down.
Until hit means you're alive!
We know the hiding place of Mickey.
It is an hour that we feel the stench.
"Understand, understand."
"Excuse me now, first and after."
I did not know how to reach you.
"Before the fuse burning, you were gone."
I remember.
I tried.
"LeBaron has found hanging in your window and thanks to a photo of your cousin on ""him"", take him to the apartment in the face that I had to empty."
"- It's the most, have not understood anything!"
- And Mickey?
You have done?
I destroy everything I love.
"We repeat, chin."
"Watch the Venini, it's not destroyed at all."
"Indeed, you know that was a lover of my mother?"
He discovered that the love had no money for this animal.
He was a thug that proved that he did not have the means to offer what he thought it could throw away.
"And now, no longer, does not want more, do not know."
"Thank you, I do."
Here is the soup my first Venini mistreated.
Mickey has shaken the tree
Matalon and the bad the gate waiting to ...
"If you are a man, don't continue lying there."
He is the man under discussion now.
"A dirty affair between men, of honor, of power."
Complaints?
Complaining about my mother?
I listen to my tears ...
Want to taste my love?
Love makes miracles.
It happens fairly often.
"Well, the good news is, we didn't have to go to the emergency room."
"Yeah, I suppose you're right."
Although part of me was looking forward to all of the excitement.
"And now my personal favorite, Mr. Bunny Rabbit."
(crowd groans)
"Hey, where have you been?"
"Awash in social pressure, but I'm back, and I've got something I'm going to say."
"Well, don't tell the story about the two priests on the golf course, 'cause Dreama already did that."
It got a laugh.
I just want to say that I've learned an important lesson tonight.
I realized that what a person looks like on the outside doesn't matter half as much as what she's like on the inside.
I think this belongs to Sabrina.
Or Allan Carr.
Don't get me wrong.
"I'm all for hygiene and grooming, but thanks to you,"
I'll be keeping it all in perspective.
QUICK:
This is a moment she'll never want to forget.
Say cheese.
"Mrs. Quick, no!"
So there we were receiving our crowns when suddenly Sabrina ballooned out.
She was huge.
"At this time, we think a rogue bee may have been the culprit."
Wow.
I hope she wasn't planning to wear it to the prom.
"Well, I'm sure Sabrina will be fine."
Thanks for bringing her home.
(crickets chirping)
SABRINA:
Is the coast clear?
"Oh, I've learned my lesson."
People are so used to them it would be difficult to scare them.
I bet silence would scare them more.
It'd leave them with their own noises.
Exactly.
Like what happened to me.
What about the play?
Good.
After this long time there's nothing much to do but asking questions.
And Clara?
Did you have any children?
One daughter.
We're separated.
But you were the perfect couple!
"Well, at least to me!"
You're exaggerating.
- It was a crazy love!
I'm telling you!
"Even once, the cops stopped you in the middle of the street!"
Because we were making out.
At that time kissing in the street at daylight...
You tell me.
It was only because we were young.
You still are.
Not long ago I read your article in a magazine.
I can't remember which one.
"You basically said the real protest emerges spontaneously, apart from the political parties."
It wasn't exactly like that.
Something like that.
"As you know, I don't care about politics at all."
I can't do nothing about it.
It must be because of my pessimism.
"But every time I think about those issues, I get useless conclusions."
"Yeah, I mean, it's a top-flight policy."
So Preston is playing the savior.
And it looks like that monthly donation that Pamela makes to Preston's campaign is her disability check.
My guess is Trevor authorized that because he feels beholden to Preston.
He probably idolizes him.
So Prestons manipulating the Mills family to further his own agenda.
He's behind everything.
He took advantage of Trevor when he was weak and vulnerable.
"He gains his trust, then he brainwashes him."
Turn him into a killer.
"Uh, guys there's something else."
FBI!
Pamela Mills?
House is empty.
"He's not here, but I found this in his bedroom."
It's addressed to her.
"""The price of peace is sacrifice."
"""And I'm prepared to pay that price, no matter how high."
"I hope you'll still love me."""
This is a good-bye letter.
Or a suicide note.
He doesn't profile as suicidal.
"No, but he knows this could be his final mission."
He may want to go out in a blaze of glory.
It's all about the election.
He's only got one move left.
We need to secure Mayor Wennington.
Have the rest of the team find Hilary Ross.
Mmm.
Hello.
You have reached Hilary Ross.
Please leave a detailed message.
"If New Christine and I get married, and you and Jeff get married, you'll be my mother-in-law."
"No, I won't."
The fourth grade class will now sing a song to those important people in our lives we call grandparents.
"Hey, Christine, what do you have when mother-in-law's up to her neck in concrete?"
Not enough concrete.
Funny.
"It was funny 20 minutes ago, and it's funny now."
"# You're a grand old man, # # you're a generous man #"
# And we love how you # # give to our school #
# With your silver hair #
"# You were there last year, # # when we needed an Olympic pool #"
# Should auld # # acquaintance you forget #
# Just remember # # we need your check!
#
"Did you enjoy the singing, Mother Campbell?"
You still got it.
I got another one:
What do you have when your mother-in-law is up to her neck in quicksand?
I hate you?
Close.
Sand that's not quick enough.
"Oh, hey, I got one."
What did the mother-in-law do to thejackass?
What?
Ow!
"Don't pay attention to him, Christine."
What the hell is wrong with you now?
I'm just so happy.
"I love my dad so much, and I've always respected you."
"And now that you're together, it's just so great."
"You know, I never had a very close relationship with my mother."
We hardly ever talked.
But you inherited me.
You didn't... see something in me.
"Fred, the Americans are getting more ruthless by the day."
"And those propeller plans that you got for me, the plans you and Emmett worked to steal."
They were fake.
Fake?
160 Soviet seamen died.
"Oh, God."
They planted fake plans all over the country and then just waited for us to take one.
I keep thinking about all the planning it took.
And I wondered -- did they even care how many people die?
This administration -- the stuff they get away with makes me sick.
Yeah.
Think about what they did when you go into that room tomorrow.
"Or whenever you feel the least bit intimidated, just think about all those...kids that died."
Paige.
Go away.
Turn it off!
Get up.
Why?
Because I said so.
Clean the refrigerator.
What?
You woke me up to clean the refrigerator?
Yes.
"And after that, mop the floors and fold the towels in the basement."
I have school tomorrow.
Why are you doing this?
You want to be a grown-up?
You want to spend money the way you want?
Being a grown-up means doing things you don't want to do -- all the time.
It means working when you are exhausted and almost never getting what you want when you want it.
"Mrs. Nelson, when was the last time you saw your husband?"
Yesterday at breakfast.
He was taking a business class at NYU on Thursday nights.
He wanted to open his own wrestling school.
So he never came home last night after class?
I fell asleep.
I called the police in the morning when he wasn't home.
But they said I had to wait 48 hours before he'd be officially missing.
Looks like yr husband was quite a successful coach.
"Mrs. Nelson, can you think of anyone who might have wanted to hurt your husband?"
No.
Vince was a great guy.
Everyone admired him.
Did he owe anybody money?
Or have a drug problem or a gambling habit?
"I'm sorry... but if you knew him, you'd know how ridiculous your questions are."
Okay.
Thank you so much.
"Please, give us a call us if you remember anything else."
There was one thing.
"I don't see how it could be related, but yesterday when I came home from work, someone was lurking on our roof."
I saw their shadows through the skylights there.
Looked like two people.
I heard them talking.
Creeping around.
It was kind of scary.
What time was this?
Around 4:00.
I knocked ony neighbor's door.
He said he would go up and check.
And?
"He said he saw something that looked like blood, but no people."
How long's my lunch hour?
An hour.
"Meanwhile, Jay really had arranged some great work experience for Simon, freezing his arse off at a disgusting plant-hire yard."
This is shit.
I don't wanna do this for a living.
"Nah, it's all right!"
"We'll be able to drive the diggers soon, I reckon."
Jay?
Why have you stopped?
"This is work experience, not standing-around-being-a-useless-twat experience."
You don't need any experience at that - you're the expert!
"Sorry, Dad, we only stopped for a moment."
This is well knackering.
"You'd better get used to it, cos with your brains you'll be fucking lucky to get a job throwing shit into a skip!"
This isn't exactly how you described it.
"Get many Valentine's cards, Simon?"
- Just the one.
- One more than Jay's ever got.
- I got plenty.
"- Don't worry, there's a girl out there for you."
You just need to find a desperate bird that likes the smell of BO and blokes with tiny cocks!
"Now get back to work,"
I ain't paying you to sit on your scrawny arse.
Nice.
- All right?
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you should be at work?
- They let me go home at lunch.
You jammy bastard.
"Si, what's all this I hear about you having a fight with Danny Moore?"
What?
!
You disappeared for a few days again and didn't even call.
What was I to do?
Who am I to you?
An empty place?
I'm sitting here in depression and you're waiting for me to serve to you!
Great King!
People who love you caught criminals!
"The people are waiting for you judgement, Solomon!"
Who are these people?
"They are your enemies, great King."
They have destroyed the new sacrifial altar that you built.
In darkness the earth trembles.
I said to them:
"""Gods, sons of the Lord!"
"You're gods but you live like humans and will fall like all the kings."""
The King has ruled to execute the criminals.
Execute them!
"You are the one who should be judged, Solomon!"
Let this execution be a lesson to everyone who dares go against the works of the great King Solomon!
Let justice be done!
It is easy to kill with other people's hands.
"Remember your fear, Solomon."
It will become your sentence.
Solomon!
Our blood is your vanity.
Today you will see us and tomorrow we will see you.
I think they deserve your mercy.
They are enemies of the state.
They believe in you.
And you make them believe in a sin.
I may forgive my enemies but not the enemies of the state.
Turn to the bureaucrats we know.
"Who is this ""someone"" to whom a citizen can ""go"""
that isn't so far up the cop's ass you need a digging crew to find them?
"There's only one person,"
And he's got the best investigators in the state.
The footage disappeared while you were looking at it?
Who has the access to do that?
Only the police.
And the shooting?
"Besides me, only the police knew where DeBray was headed."
"You're leveling quite an accusation, Laura."
That's not the worst part.
The jewelry from DeBray's apartment never made it to lockup.
It's gone.
"Well, DeBray is dead."
What does somebody gain from stealing that evidence?
I don't know.
"But whatever these people are trying to hide, the man who shot Haskell DeBray is out there."
"Tom, if you nail the dirty cop and get him to talk, you can catch the killer before he kills someone else."
"Then I'm gonna have to nail him, aren't I?"
"It goes without saying this stays in this room, right?"
- Yeah.
- Of course.
Good.
Good.
"Okay, Janet?"
"Serena, how about we take you home, little lady, and we have taco night at the ranch?"
- I make the guacamole.
- Deal.
"Captain Nico, you come, too."
"Sorry, Serena."
Captain Nico's got to catch a couple more bad guys before I can have a taco.
"Janet, can you have them bring up my car?"
If the key was already in the keyhole... then how did your fingerprints... get on the middle barrel of the key?
"I mean, if you had only turned the key, like you just said... then your fingerprints wouldn't be there, right?"
The fact of the matter is... when you broke the pane and put your hand in... the key was already in your hand.
I...
I didn't do...
"Natasha Malhotra, you are hereby arrested on the charges of murder of..."
Don't even think about it.
Kabir?
No.
Lqbal Chand Malhotra.
The mastermind of this game.
That's right.
Place your pistol on the table.
Out.
"You too, Mr. Menon."
"If I had a pistol, you wouldn't have been alive right now."
"In that case, thank you for not carrying a gun."
Natasha.
Her gun.
"May I ask you something, Mr. Menon?"
When did you piece the puzzle together?
At the hospital.
If I hadn't seen the photograph...
I wouldn't have known that you and Kabir were identical twins.
"And they say, twins... don't give birth to twins."
"It's over, Malhotra."
Game over.
It's your game that is over.
Coming here alone was a huge mistake.
Natasha... go and wait for me on the boat.
Some things aren't meant to be done in the presence of children.
It could corrupt their minds.
Aka more aliases than they would care to mention.
They are small-time thieves who have inexplicably hit the big-time.
- I smell artifact.
- I smell a loser.
Come on.
"Let's let Artie get through this so we can just not be here any longer than necessary, all right?"
- Thank you very much.
Much appreciated.
- You're welcome.
- So what is this... this artifact?
- It's unconfirmed.
"But if there's one, it's given these two an unbelievable amount of luck."
That defies all the laws of probability.
"They've had winning streaks in Miami, Detroit and Atlantic City..."
Not one single gaming commission alarm bell has been tripped.
"Well, how?"
"Well, they go into a gaming room as high rollers."
Anybody?
"Okay, fine."
And they're really good.
"And they win just enough money to stay under the radar, right?"
And then they get...
Fine.
They move on and don't get caught.
So they're taking a little back from the house.
"OMG, what's the BFD?"
What?
Iniquitous hands with the means to exploit fate.
"- ""Iniquitous"" means ""bad."""
"- Thanks, Roget."
So where are they now?
"3 hours ago, they checked into room 1510 at the Maximus hotel in Las Vegas."
- No.
I misunderstood your behaviour.
But I would like this not to occur many times.
"This never happens more, respectable major lord."
Well this not something turned out nicely.
Not trouble.
It is not the important one.
The beauty arrives then.
It is necessary to wait its time out only.
It is the important one that we are here.
We are together.
Our hand moves.
The time goes by.
How do you feel?
"Very much, very much good."
"Really, very well."
Tót family did not get used to the night out however.
After 2-3 clocks the signs of the tiredness on they start appearing.
And this the tiredness showed on disciplined Tót mostly.
What it is possible to understand of course.
Since he slept in his bed already at this time another time
"Well you know, simply fascinating this work."
"Do not know to say, how much I enjoy it."
"I know that now, this work brings me into order then totally."
If only would be so.
"We would be glad the best, major lord."
Are you not tired?
"I hope so, you speak if you want to sleep."
To sleep.
Yet what no.
Very good one like that to do this with the major lord.
I am me so with him somehow.
The medical officer and Alicia's father say I'm a psychopath.
"Yeah, a psychopath."
"They say it's good for the trial, but I don't give a shit about that."
I need to see Alicia and find out how it all ended.
"If this goes on, I'm capable of doing anything."
They say I'm a psychopath?
"Well, I'll behave like one."
"Don't say that, please!"
And get me another lawyer.
The one I've got practically throws up on me when he looks at me.
OK.
I'll tell the concierge to give you my keys.
Rent it out and that'll pay the lawyer.
"I'll rent it, because mine has been rented out too."
Great.
I like that you're my tenant.
"I've been thinking a lot about you, especially at night."
Why at night?
Because I read at night.
I've read all your travel guides.
"It was like traveling for months with you at my side, telling me things no one tells you on journeys."
My favorite is the one on Havana.
I really identified with those people who've got nothing and invent everything.
"When you describe that Cuban woman leaning out a window by the ""Malecon"""
"waiting uselessly, seeing how time passes and nothing happens..."
I thought that woman was me.
"Good morning, ma'am."
I'm Benigno's friend.
"Are you Marco, the Argentinean?"
Yes.
I'm the concierge.
Benigno rang to tell me you'd be renting the apartment.
You know what she said?
"She said, ""Vijay are you cross with me?"
"I said, come on, why would I be angy with you?"
"Why do you think like this, Meena?"
"She said, ""Vijay, why do you always remain far from me?"
"""You never even give me a look"""
"And then when I gave her a look, do you know what I saw, Sheetal?"
I saw mo large drops oftears in her large eyes.
That moment I realised that this girl loves me from within her heart.
She considers me to be her god.
I said...
"Meena don't, I can't bear to see tears in your eyes."
For my sake wipe it.
Please!
Excuse me.
This isn't your Meena's arm.
"You won't be doing the Lindy overnight... but with proper care, that leg will be 1 00%."
Why is there a bandage on my hand?
What's wrong with it?
"When you consider that boys come through here every day... and lose their sight, limbs, even their lives--"
What happened to my hand?
"Well, you have some nerve and tendon damage."
"Fortunately, there will be only slightly diminished use of three fingers."
- They'll look perfectly normal.
"- What do you mean, ""slightly diminished""?"
There will be a certain loss of dexterity.
- For how long?
- Afraid it'll be permanent.
"- Oh, my God."
- But your leg will be fine--
I don't care about my leg.
- Damn it.
"- Tom, cab."
- Oh!
"And if that ginger viper so much as gets her nose through the office door while we're out, you're sacked."
And don't think I won't know.
I can smell her shaving cream on the wind.
Anything else?
"Since you're so keen to flex your femininity, you can tidy up!"
I heard furniture.
"""Angels of the Sea."
Across the Waves.
Two to Dunkirk.
Three to Dunkirk.
Dunkirk or Bust.
"Busts to Dunkirk."""
Somewhere in the world there is a bullet with that man's name on.
Why hasn't he been called up?
"I mean, Parfitt's too old, but Buckley--"
Baker persuaded someone that Buckley was more use to the war effort with a typewriter.
It won't last.
"He'll end up in uniform, like every other mother's son."
"That is, if he ever had a mother."
"More likely, Parfitt found him in a pub, spawning spontaneously in the sawdust."
"You know, a lot of men are scared we won't go back into our boxes when this is all over."
It makes them belligerent.
Something's changed.
I tidied.
What happened at the meeting?
I outlined our proposed changes.
They accepted them.
- What's this?
- Lunch.
"The girls can pilot the boat home, all right?"
I still haven't finished what I was saying.
President Choi's daughter has caused her father some trouble.
Her character is different from others.
"Yesterday, two female guards handed in their letter of resignation."
"The reason I came here is to protect the President, not the President's daughter."
"Hey, newcomer!"
Are you in charge here?
Do you think you can do whatever you want?
It's not that.
It's just that my dream is...
Stop talking about dreams!
Protecting the President's family is as important as protecting the President himself.
The training has been postponed to next year and it will be absolved by new employees.
"It's six months of training, and I will be the trainer."
Repeat after me.
One.
"You are entitled to watch and listen, but not to talk."
One.
"I'm entitled to watch and listen, but not to talk."
Second.
My function is to be a protective shield.
Second.
My function is to be a... protective shield.
Lee Yun Seong.
Lee Yun Seong.
Lee Yun Seong!
"I texted you several times, to ask for your bank account, but you didn't even reply once."
I said you don't need to.
That amount is just like the price of chewing gum for me.
"That's all you want to say, right?"
Wait...
"I don't know if I can chew that much gum, but please let me try to repay you, okay?"
- So what are we gonna do here?
- Should we drop the balloons?
"- No, no balloons."
- Maybe just drop half of them?
- No!
- Why do we even have balloons?
"Ma'am, I seriously overstepped the mark going out onstage."
That was a fuck-up.
"Yeah, I'll say."
You might want to watch that if you become president.
"If that does happen, want to be my veep?"
Why don't you go help them with the balloons?
Copy that.
[Woman] And now begins the ancient word.
"The sun sleeps below the sky, and the world turns upside down."
"In the night, we make our feast."
"For centuries, I danced for them, the blood-gatherer, the bringer of souls."
"I've brought them the lost ones, the troubled ones, the desperate ones."
"Now, I am free, and the world turns upside down again."
"They are thirsty for revenge, and nothing will stop them."
"No boundaries, no borders."
"They will come for me, but I am coming for them."
"Their empire of blood will fall, and will not rest until it all burns."

"- How you doin', hot stuff?"
- Livin' the dream.
- How about yourself?
Who?
Who paid you?
Stop!
You're hurting me.
Who paid you?
Marzio.
Marzio!
Marzio Catalano?
The castle guard?
He's the one who cut the balcony palings.
I saw him leaving Don Francesco's room with a saw in his hand.
"I didn't understand what he was doing at the time... but when the lord died, he gave me some money..."
A lot.
So I wouldn't talk.
"Then, at the trial, he gave me some more."
"I didn't want to hurt Beatrice, or you... but I was afraid."
There was nothing else I could do;
he threatened me.
But who gave him the money?
Marzio doesn't have a penny.
That I do not know.
Ask him yourself.
"Having examined all the evidence... the court of Rome finds Beatrice Cenci guilty of the murder... of her father, Don."
"Francesco Cenci, Roman patrician, and decrees that she must pay for this unnatural crime with the death penalty."
"In light of her age, and as a sign of clemency... punishment by quartering, which is expected for patricide... has been commuted to a less painful death by decapitation."
There were two of them.
They shot me.
Then it was Giacomo.
He ordered you to cut the balcony palings.
He gave you the money to bribe Martina.
- He's a rogue.
"I've always been a faithful servant, and I would never betray him."
But too tempting to pass up.
Argh!
I'll bet that smarts.
"But you know what they say - no pain, no gain."
"Bravo, Goliath."
You've earned a breather.
"Trouble is, nothing's what it seems at the Hotel Cabal."
"The strength I was expecting, but not the boundless fortitude, the indomitable spirit."
This is a true warrior.
Breaking him may take a bit longer than usual.
"Uh, speaking of which, suppose I'd gone down the wrong chute?"
With no key?
"Bad news, my boy."
A warm body is all it takes to activate the automated mechanisms in any one of these rooms.
"Without one of these to deactivate the rooms, anyone caught in there would be bouncing off the walls forever."
Mace!
Check out the screen.
Where's Goliath?
Not to worry.
He must be in one of the adjoining rooms.
- This... this makes no sense.
- (alarm sounds)
- Now what?
- It's the security alarm.
Impossible.
No one could navigate his way around the rooms like that.
Unless...
The key you dropped!
Somehow the gargoyle must have found it.
It's allowing him to pass unharmed from room to room.
"At this rate, he'll be out in minutes."
"Oh, man!"
"Unfortunately, no such tunnels exist, but don't worry, we have plenty of other exciting sights to show you guys."
Follow me this way.
"Now, does anyone wanna guess how old the White House is?"
- Yes.
- Two hundred and twenty-two years old.
That's very accurate.
Construction began in 1792 on what was then called the President's House.
"Now, Article 1, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution set forth that a district of no more than 1O miles square should house the new seat of government."
Does anyone know why?
So no one state could claim the President's House.
Right again.
"You're a real keener, aren't you?"
"Now, the founders were crafty..."
"Hey, so you can tell me the truth."
Do you get picked on a lot in school?
"No, I don't."
- It's a gift certificate for a massage.
- I could use one.
"Martin, it's-"
- It's been...
"I know, for me too, Ted."
You know you're gonna miss this.
- When's the last time you took a day off?
"- Oh, I'm fine."
I'm fine.

"I was doing a random check, found a counterfeit $100 chip."
Costs a lot of money to make a phony this good.
You guys found a fake chip?
How long has he been on duty?
He's been up 36 hours.
I told him to take a break-
You go home.
Get some sleep.
I'm fine.
"If it's such a good fake, how can you tell it's fake?"
"Felt a little heavy in my hand, so I weighed it."
"Ends up it's 34 centigrams over specs, which only allow for a seven centigram variance margin."
You could tell this was 34 centigrams heavy just by holding it?
So happens I could.
Why are you being such a hater?
You know how little 34 centigrams is?
Shut up.
Both of you shut up.
"You-You... go home, get some sleep or I will put you to sleep."
You gents have come up with a beaut.
Might even work it into my show.
This was the murder weapon.
"My constable found it at your old campsite, the one you were staying at the night of the murder."
Why did you move campsites?
I move whenever I want.
It's the beauty of a home on wheels.
"This is your knife, is it not?"
Might be... might not be.
But I doubt you can prove I ever touched that thing.
So if I'm the murderer... show me the evidence that'll hang me.
I didn't have enough to hold him in custody.
The only person who knows what happened that night is Fen.
The bite mark is proof enough that she met Mr. de Jaager.
But we can't communicate with her.

As hurtful as it may be to learn that they were criminals  you should know.

"Yes, I should meet Roland's father."
His name is Harold Connor.

"Nice landing, Uncle Bene."
Right on the 50-yard line.
Should've gone for a touchdown.
"Next time, I'll put it right between the goalposts."
Can't wait to see the museums and go to all the concerts.
That's why we arranged this little vacation.
We've been so busy establishing our community on Witch Mountain that you two haven't had an opportunity to see what life in the big city is all about.
I'd rather go to the beach and learn how to surf.
There'll be another time for that.
"Just remember what I told you, and have a lot of fun."
- It's locked.
- Tia?
"Tony, come back here."
"Now, never energize unless it's absolutely necessary."
Tia?
"If earth kids can live here without energizing, you can too."
You the party I'm supposed to pick up?
Alright?
Good.
So tell me...
Can you be trusted?
That's enough Tom.
"... It's a place, an organism, an arrangement  that operates primarily without money or monetary transactions ... but rather human interaction, so that we may confront one another  and exchange ideas, where everyone can find their own voice  and achieve a self-realization."
That's the top priority.
We are open to everyone who really wishes to contribute and live among us.
What develops here depends on each and every one of us.
That's the basic idea.
Very good.
Hello.
"Ah, my neighbor."
"Yes, that's right."
Let's sing something together.
I'm a friend to the art of singing.
"Sounds like there's a ""but"" coming."
But... only when I feel like it.
It's much different for me.
I could sing all day long.
"Obviously, you don't like my singing."
No.
It's dreadful.
I'm just being honest.
That's how I am.
I'm very sorry but your singing annoys me.
That's why you're here?
I just wanted to make that clear before we get closer to each other.
Who says that I want to get closer to you?
Get out!
The Goldfish
- Welcome to the news!
"Well, her arms and legs seem to function all right."
"Well, then there's no brain damage or muscle paralysis."
"Well, Dad, I don't know about brain damage."
Something's happened to Judy.
"Paula, you sure you're not imagining things?"
"Dad, I swear to you, I am not imagining anything."
And I think Judy's suffering from amnesia.
"Now, what can I do?"
"All right, Paula, I'll tell you what to do."
Take Judy back to the clinic and do a complete diagnostic work-up on her.
"Take her pulse, blood pressure, uh, respiration readings."
"Do an EKG, an EEG, and you can X-ray both arms and legs."
"And if she's still out of sorts you can give her a mild sedative, ok?"
"Marsh, is all that really necessary?"
"Oh, no, of course not."
I just want to keep her occupied.
"Uh, Paula, you sound as if you're having kind of a bad case of nerves."
"Dad, my nerves are perfectly calm."
"Now, there's something wrong with Judy."
She's a different chimp.
"Honey, she probably just wants some attention."
She's not faking.
She is sick.
She's very sick.
"All right, honey."
All right.
"Take Judy back to the clinic, and do as I told you."
Are you sure you feel up to it?
"Yes, Dad, I'll do anything to help her."
- Anything.
"- Ok, honey."
Paula and her instant diagnosis.
So your 43 boob dollars are gonna get us to Texas?
Don't rule out my roll of butt quarters.
Sweaty but ready.
"All right, can y'all folks lock up?"
I got to make a riverboat before it takes off to New Orleans.
My cousin Tim put a voodoo curse on me.
I got to talk to him about removing it.
"Caroline,"
New Orleans is close to Texas.
"The Hamburglar says so on my McDonald's placemat, and he would never lie unless it's about stealing delicious hamburgers."
I'm confused.
Do you want hamburgers or do you wanna take that riverboat?
"Obviously, the dream scenario is both."
"Ah, thank you very much."
"Max, people have tickets."
You have to pay to get on this... what I'm positive will be my sixth near-death experience.
So bend over and unclench.
We need those butt quarters.
Who are you?
My mother at a church carnival?
"Have your tickets ready, please."
All we have to do is act like we belong.
Do I at least get to have an adorable Southern accent?
No accent.
"Well, I do declare that is mighty disappointing."
Just follow my lead.
It's time to touch strangers.
"Hey, you got a permit for those guns?"
"Well, I say, you got a permit for that light-up yo-yo?"
I have a girlfriend.
"Keep walking, buster."
"Max, the riverboat doesn't get to New Orleans for two days and we have nowhere to sleep."
Shall we get going?
- Give me a quick briefing.
- The nursery had 70100 employees.
"Now it's threatened with closure, and has debts of several million."
Thank you.
- Is anything wrong?
"- No, no."
- Lebech has withdrawn from Ussing.
- Has Ussing commented on that?
He's probably about to.
I don't comment on rumours.
Would you like to hear our job creation policies?
- It's a storm in a teacup.
"- Yes, but as I said..."
The organisers are asking us to answer a few extra questions.
What do you say?
As long as we talk job creation reform and government abusing the benefit law.
- You can borrow mine.
- Thank you.
I'll just run through it with my advisor.
It's a crude game you're playing.
"If you think you can sneak a win, with rumours from an unreliable witness, you must be really desperate."
- There's more than just a witness.
"- I'll explain myself, don't worry."
You prepare yourself for a libel suit.
- It's all right by us.
- Good.
Anders was called back to Christiansborg to help the police.
"- Unfortunately, it couldn't wait."
- What a shame.
No comment.
Now he wants them to solve an old case.
"Yeah, and who are they to say we can't carve out our slice of the American dream, huh?"
I'm a capitalist.
I don't kowtow to threats.
Fuck the evil empire.
They can't stop me from retiring at 40.
"Uh, you're past 40, Joe."
That's why they can't stop me.

"For a little guy, you've got some big balls."
"Hey, good to hear from you again."
How's the family vacay going?
None of your business.
What is your business is Vernon.
"And apparently, you didn't take care of business very well."
"- I'm sorry, come again?"
- I didn't come a first time.
You said you had Vernon under control.
Do you know he converted his endorsement money into ownership in a grow house?
Ownership?
"That's something I know something about, Joe."
"Uh, I have no idea why they think that would be okay."
It's totally unacceptable.
"I appreciate your concurrence, Joe."
Tell your client I'm cutting him.
"Boys, knock it off!"
( gasps )
Hey.
( clears throat )
I'm gonna share something with you and I hope you will be as supportive of me as I've been of you this morning.
Kisan Teague has the kind of talent that can take our offense over the top and finally turn the negativity around.
- I'm listening.
Are you kidding?
"And waste a chance to know something they don't, something this huge?"
"I'm the best thing that could happen to your mission, 'cause I'm gonna teach you everything you need to know about Earth."
Can you teach me how to make my human stop yelling?
Dani?
I don't think anyone can do that.
"I'm Cody, by the way."
- I'm Blades.
- Boulder.
Classified...
- That's Chase.

"So, Cody, now that you know what we are, name one good reason why we shouldn't leave this planet right now."
These tunnels like this one all over the island.
And they all end in the bunker.
Great for sneaking out of the firehouse.
Wow.
That's like a million optics set in carbon.
- So beautiful.

So why would you ever wanna leave?
This is what everyone would expect you to act like.
See?
"Lock your legs, stick out your arms..."
You try.
Really?
"I don't know where you learned that, but no."
"Look, Cody, I understand what you're doing, but what I don't understand is how ""talking-like-this"""

The trick with Kade is to make him think he is in charge.
"Trust me, I've been doing it for years."
Is that part of the film?
He also buys me birthday gifts.
I'm the one who picks out those birthday gifts.
He has no idea what you even like.
He doesn't care about you at all.
That's not how it is!
Isn't it?
"Dad, he..."
He sends me messages from the States every day!
"Good morning, Mary."
Is the weather in Taipei nice today?
"Mary, I love you."
He writes the same thing every time.
"But the contents of the messages are always the same, right?"
He's just humoring you.
A message like that can just be copied from old ones.
It takes less than a minute to write.
That's not how it is!
"No matter how busy Daddy is, every morning and every night, he writes me an email."
Mary.
"Although every note is pretty much the same, Daddy writes to me every day..."
So what?
Didn't you just say he writes the same thing every day?
A letter like that takes less time than cooking ramen.
"You dare to compare Daddy's letter to ramen, that's too much!"
You say that yourself all the time.
Plus the time here is different from the time in America.
But he still accommodates the times I wake up and go to sleep to write me emails.
He tries really hard!
Isn't that what I frequently say to you?
Maybe those messages aren't even written by your dad.
He could have his assistant write them.
He wouldn't allow other people access to his email!
You will repent for all these.
"Sir, I am waiting for you."
Who are you?
- I'm Varun.
I'm a program producer in Q TV.

Yes.

A guy was found dead in a road accident in Kanyakumari-Nagercoil highway recently...
I want some details regarding that case.
Why do you want to know?
I'm working on a program about unsolved death cases caused by road accidents.
Did anyone come in search of this man?
"In some cases, people come searching immediately."
"At other times, they come a bit late."
But no one has come in search of this man so far.
What about his body?
We are done with postmortem and other formalities.
Won't you wait till someone comes to identify the person?
There is neither a mortuary big enough nor the Government funds large enough to do that.
"If no one comes in search of the dead person, we proceed with the formalities."
"If anyone comes after that, we will verify with a photo."
"If we have any of their belongings, we return them."
Why should we?
We didn't have anything anyone would want!
"Easy, easy."
They poured it on like...
"Like phasers, only worse, whatever they were using."
I tried to signal them.
"We called up, tried to surrender."
We had women and children.
I told them that.
I begged them.
They wouldn't listen.
They didn't let up for a moment.
"Lieutenant, the Enterprise received two messages, ostensibly from Cestus III."
One for the Enterprise to go there and the other for myself and my tactical crew to beam down to the surface.
"They hit us a full day before you got there, captain."
"No messages came from us, captain."
Why did they do it?
Why?
Why did they do it?
There has to be a reason.
- There has to be a reason!
- It was a trap.
Getting the Enterprise to come to Cestus III.
Getting us and our whole crew to come ashore.
Very clever.
As to the reason...
The reason is crystal clear.
The Enterprise is the only protection in this section of the Federation.
"Destroy the Enterprise, and everything is wide open."
"You allude to invasion, captain, yet positive proof has not..."
I have all the proof I need on Cestus III.
"Not necessarily, sir."
"Your mother, how can you leave her alone?"
Mother's always been alone.
"Oh, Selena."
I cried all the way to New York and my eyes were the color of the oak leaves that had started to fall back home.
"For days, I struggled to keep alive and I shivered with loneliness in a back room on the fourth floor of nowhere."
"There were times when I wanted to crawl home but somehow I managed, and I stayed."
"I learned what I could endure, but none of us, in New York or in Peyton Place could guess how much would be demanded of us that winter of deep despair."
I knew families at home would be getting up on frosty mornings driving their sons to a place of hurried goodbye.
I prayed for them.
"Fellas, get your last cup of civilian coffee."
The Army stuff is used for waterproofing shingles.

- Maybe they'll drop his mother.
- She'd kill 1000 Japanese before she'd let one touch her little boy.
Brought you a doughnut.
"Rodney, I'm gonna cry."
"No, you don't."
"Betty, you don't know how glad I am that I married you."
"Rodney, I hope so."
Your father's over there.
Go say goodbye to him.
Go on.
Go say goodbye to him.
He loves you as much as I do.
Go on.

What else did she tell you about this cat?
Anything?
"Just that Adalind brought it in, and it scratched her."
And she wouldn't believe anything I said about Adalind.
That's why I brought her to the trailer.
That's why I brought her to you.
"Okay, I get it."
"But I got to tell you, it was a little on the short side for a warning."
- When did she get scratched?
- Today.
"Look, Nick, I know you're hoping the doctors are going to be able to do something for her, but you saw what happened to Hank, you saw what happened to your sergeant."
"We got to get our hands on that cat, man."
- Detective Burkhardt?
- Yeah?
We have her stabilized.
"If this is an infectious disease, she'll need to stay quarantined."
"Normally, cat scratches are not that dangerous, so there may be something else going on here."
The tests are going to take quite a while to run.
There's nothing more you can do right now.
I suggest you go home.
"As soon as we know something, we'll call you."
"Look, Nick,"
I know you want to stay here and be with Juliette.
I do.
But that's not going to help.
Let's find that cat.
All right.
[Cell phone rings]
- Yeah.
- Nick.
They've been muttering that for years.
One day they'll stop muttering and go.
That's why we need city land for BankExchange.
"- No argument, Lenny."
- And a subway stop.
And an off-ramp from the expressway.
The city's $25 billion in debt.
We're in no position to build off-ramps.
"3,000 workers, you don't want to build a subway stop?"
What's your interest in this?
Did you buy a few options around the city property?
Of course he did.
So did every other developer in town.
"Notwithstanding that, Mr. Deputy Mayor if you don't transport their employees BankExchange will dump this deal and forget about New York and put up their 60-story building in New Jersey instead."
So be it.
"The mayor loves BankExchange, but can't afford infrastructure."
You're flying in the face of real politics.
Subways get people to jobs.
Jobs mean votes.
I thought John Pappas liked votes.
"He loves votes, Frank."
But no infrastructure.
Much as the city approves of a subway station and off-ramp it can't pay for them.
- Where are you going?
- I have an appointment in Manhattan.
This meeting's over?
I heard you say no.
Can I offer you a ride?
"No, thanks."
I make it quicker on the train.
Here he comes.
Judge Stern!
We can't wait any longer.
It's time we take back what is ours!
It's time to take back our city!

"There they are, folks, the sweethearts of the big screen, and Republic City's most famous couple,"
Bolin and ginger.
Let me get a picture.
"Wow, that was fun."
And did you hear what Shiro said?
We're Republic City's most famous couple.
"Bolin, you're a doll, but you're as dumb as the rocks you bend."
We are not a couple.
That's not what Shiro said.

"And they're being greeted by entrepreneur extraordinaire,"

Mwah!
What do you think?
No expense has been spared.
I brought in the finest entertainers from ba sing se and the best food from around the world.
"Heck, I even had this red carpet imported from the fire nation."
They make the best red stuff over there.
In fact...
"all right, picture time!"
"Varrick, you didn't have to do all this for us."
I wanted to.
"Mr. President, I took one look at your wife, and I knew that you were a man of exquisite taste."
"Oh, shit, I forgot about the car."
You haven't been moving it for street cleaning?
I've been gone for three weeks.
Do you know how many tickets I must have?

I kind of would have thought this to be beneath you.
"You know, at one time I would have as well, but look at me now."

You don't even need me.
"God, you really believe that, don't you?"
I'm not sure how to answer that without making things worse.
I supported you when nobody gave a shit about you.

Good.

It also got you the cover of Time.
You're going national Mayor Pappas.

"I believe I did, a minute ago."
I was having an acute attack of self-importance but it's about to come to an end because here's the man to cut me down to size.
"Kevin, we missed you."
"Sorry, folks."
Didn't mean to interrupt you.
"Kevin's been busy today, I'll bet."
This must be Mrs. Marquand.
It's been quite a day for you.
We don't want any stray bullets around Madison Square Garden.
Ignore the senator.
He keeps a little anchor to windward.
Don't we all?
Shouldn't we return to the burning issue of the day?
The convention?
We'll turn this city upside down for you.
We'll stage the right kind of convention.
What kind is that?
The kind that'll reelect the President.
Where will you go?
"Second cities, like Chicago?"
Resonating with memories of Hubert in '68?
California?
"The land of Jerry Brown and Tom Hayden, that nominates a Mondale."
"You could go to Miami, but it's Casablanca."
But I did find out from NYPD... that Dorothy tried twice in the past six months to have him arrested.
Assault and battery.
So maybe Morty wanted to have a little S8M party... and Dorothy wasn't up for it.
And then Cannata and Doss order a hit... 'cause she snuffed out their old friend.
"Yeah, maybe a vendetta."
Uh-uh.
It doesn't add up.
Yeah.
Why would they wanna risk blowing a multi-million dollar shot... at a casino racket on a vendetta against a cocktail waitress?
"Cannata and Doss, we'll begin with them."
"Switek, Zito, I want video surveillance at Shelborne."
"Gina and Trudy, I want you guys to try to get jobs at the hotel."
"Crockett and Tubbs, Dorothy Bain."
She's the key.
Yup.
You were supposed to get the papers... not start World War Ill.
What?
I don't wanna hear it.
No.
It's not their fault the heat showed up.
It's your fault we're in this mess to begin with.
"You had to place bets with that jackass friend of yours, Price."
"Hey, have a little respect."
The guy's dead.
Yeah.
So is our chances of turning this joint into a legit casino... if we don't beat the cops to them tally sheets.
So they find them.
Big deal.
It's only names and numbers.
Circumstantial evidence.
"They take to the DA... and the next thing we're having lunch with the grand jury, what?"
Okay.
"But...was not a ditch, major lord We jumped a shade."
"- You are crazy, Tót."
- Me?
No.
-Maybe I am the fool?
"Ow my god...no, no, no.How I would dare this assumed from my son's benefactor?"
"If you knew that this is the ditch, not ditch, you should have warned!"
Into a unpleasant situation brought for before Sóskuti.
Since just yeah.
"If I speak on the before Sóskuti,then ...major lord."
...let us go rather under the gardens.
"Nothing saves your action, Tót."
I insist on this road already now.
"Take care, major lord!"
"Jump, Tót."
After the respectable major lord only.
Do not argue.
I do not like the politesse.
- Sóskuti!
"- Yes, major lord!"
The thread of his hair will not bend for your younger brother.
Thank you very much major lord.

I do not dare to tell my yesterday's dream to you.
Imagine.
"I was a bag of itching dust, which they scattered into a beautiful girl's neck."
"That's the enemy's goal, no doubt."
He's right!
"Once they take Estabul, they'll take out their anger and hatred, and lengthen the fighting!"
We still have a way.
"You must not falter, Princess."
Rear Admiral Klom's army has surrounded the rebel army's main stronghold.
What is the meaning of this?
!
Withdraw the Roland army and release all war prisoners.
"If they do not heed our wishes, the people of Estabul will be beheaded on the spot."
We sent a letter with that content to the Roland army.
Roland's Hero King couldn't stand by and let commoners die.
How could you?
You're...
I know.
But this cannot be helped.
I wish to protect you...
Princess.
You would take our people hostage for my sake?
!
This is what the people want.
"If we lose now, what would happen to them?"
"How badly would the people of a defeated nation be oppressed, and be disgraced?"
And taking our people as hostages brings them no disgrace?
Can't this be stopped?
It cannot be.
I see.
I am naught but a puppet ruler propped up by others.
"In the end, I couldn't save anyone, could I?"
Princess!
The soldiers of Roland are!
Our army's soldiers are attacking the Estabul fortress!
I will kill him if he is seen again.
Send him away from here immediately.
Fine sir..
- Jai..
Coming Vasu
Good Morning madam
Good Morning Karthik.
How are you?
Where are you going quickly Mr. Muthyam?
New sites have come from Pune and I need to show them to Sir.
You said sites and why are there items here?
So are these what you show to Sir daily in the name of sites?
"No sir, these are the sales girls selling us the sites."
"They are not like sales girls, but look very indecent."
"Be quiet, you always get such waste doubts."
"Mr Macha, you please leave."
Not that madam..
- You please leave!
Thank you madam..
"They look a bit peculiar as said by Ratnam sir, madam"
"Looking at this, may be what they wrote in the magazines too is true."
Mr Ratnam!
I ate the salt of your father.
I cannot bear when something is going wrong.
"What is your intention, Ratnam sir?"
Do you doubt that those are not spouses and sir himself has set them up for acting?
"I was into a confusion till now, but it is now confirmed."
Doubt No. 1:
Some fellow had come called sir as brother-in-law.
Doubt No. 2:
"When she was hit, sir is shivering with anger."
Doubt No. 3:
There's not a day that goes by that I don't feel terrible about losing your boy.
But that's on me.
"So if you want revenge, then just shoot me."
You think I blame you for Kevin's death?
Sending those men in was the most courageous thing..
you ever did in your life.
You were a true commander in chief for five minutes.
You just don't have the balls to see the mission through.
What mission?
There were no nuclear weapons in Iran.
But there will be.
The Middle East is our last war.
It will be us or them.
I choose that Kevin Charles Walker will be the last American soldier..
to die in that conflict in vain.
You want that as your son's legacy?
Murdering millions of people in his name?
"Mr. President, I wish the pen were mightier than the sword, I do."
But it's just a dream.
"Stand up, sir."
History will judge who the true patriots were here today.
"I've been standing up, Martin, and I'm not gonna open that."
Martin.
"Martin, that's not necessary."
Martin!
How about now?
I can't open this for him.
"If I do, millions of people are gonna die, you understand that?"
I understand.
Goddamn it!
"Tyler, what the hell is going on?"
We got thermal alarms going off in the second floor dining room..
I only have one set... but I think I'm going to get the other two for Christmas.
What is all that stuff?
"When I get married, all this stuff will belong to my husband and my daughter."
Everything I have here will be theirs.
All of it.
It's my dowry.
This is called a hope chest.
Or trousseau in French.
So Peter was barfing?
I asked the neighbor woman to go get him.
It's like how they say it takes a village to raise a child.
"If you'll excuse me, this is a private call."
So Robby's old enough to walk home alone?
Shit lords!
There's no answer.
Robby loves to answer the phone.
"If he was there, he'd be answering it."
Maybe Peter went out looking for Robby.
"Yeah, see, this is why you don't want a village raising your kid... because there's sketchy parts of the village... and some of the villagers are junkies and child molesters."
I gotta go.
Tell Sven that Robby's missing and I had to go.
Thanks for calling.
"For customer service or furniture or mattress delivery inquiries, press 4."
"For bridal registry, press 6."
- Mann res-
- Is Robby here?
- Mann residence.
May I help you?
- Is Robby here?
No.
"If you didn't know me, would you think I was really this tall... or would you think I was standing on something?"
You're here.
I need another.
- I'll do it.
- Go climb at the terrace... and stand on the other side of the balcony rail.
"Pierre, mon cher, we need a vision."
"The year, 1323, no... 1324."
The setting:
"A stony alcove in the alps of the Capuleto... hanging from the rocky, gelid cliffs of Stratfordshire."
"Meteorology: 50 degrees, with a post perceptive chilling the air."
"The tempest has fled to bomir pastures, but its icy kiss lingers."
The mood:
Unbridled passion... a passion that unravels nature's tiring volcanoes... and rumbling earthquakes.
This deeds are acts of gods... so is this union.
You need to show Romeo and Juliette how to pose.
And you can bet your sweet ass I will.
Romeu:
"You've just been running in from Mars... you're hot and sweaty, but you're taking some danger."
"Juliette is looking hot, you know what I'm trying to mean?"
"I want the body language to be a lot more charged, okay?"
So move a lot tight closer together.
"Look into your Juliette's eyes and...""Oh!"
"Romeo, Romeo""..."
"""where art thou"", boy."
"Come on, open your heart... and show some love, some affection for her."
And Juliette... you love this man!
Oh!
Yes!
You know he's your knight in shiny armor.
I like that!
"Hold that, I'm gonna take some Polaroid photos."
"Alex, move your ass."
Move your ass.
"Out, please."
Don't bother about it.
Since when was he staying here?
They vacated last week.
THEY vacated?
How many people?
"This guy, and another man with you."
What was the other man's age?
- Probably within 30.
Take the register and look for the entry.
Here.
This one?
"SIRI, call."
98942-83-834.
"The phone number, address, and other information from the lodge are fake."
The number is registered on a fake company's name.
They have been using it illegally.
The SIM had been active till his death.
Now it's not in use.
What about the incoming and outgoing call details?
Not too many calls.
But there are repeated calls from a number.
The number that ends with 333.
I enquired about that as well.
That's also illegal.
Not in use.
Did you get information about the other guy in the lodge?
We didn't get enough details about him.
There is just one window open for investigation now.
We have to find the one who killed him in the accident.
Our program's main concept is to find information about the unidentified dead people.
We can enquire about the rest later.
Looks like I often have to remind you who's the cop.
To inspect the same gift?
Two different...
I'm quite certain they will have the same question.
On the Q.T. is one thing.
"But you're tramping through my backyard,"
"Literally tripping over my agents,"
And you don't even give me a heads-up.
We have explicit instructions not to contact you any more.
Artie Nielsen.
"Look, it's not like we can't have coffee now and then."
We just can't have you on speed dial.
Look.
I get it.
For better or for worse-- and I happen to think worse--
You two are serving a new master.
This isn't your screw-up.
It was his.
It's just that he doesn't really...
Play well with others...
- Hmm.
- So much.
"So this security officer, Ogawa, Japanese embassy,"
Is waiting for my explanation of what you were doing
And if you had anything to do with whatever the hell that was.
Any suggestions what I'm supposed to tell him?
All right.
Do me one favor.
Get on a plane and leave D.C. while I can still let you.
Can I at least have that?
Be out of here as soon as possible.
I don't think this is what Dickinson had in mind.
"Well, what are we gonna do?"
He played everything.
"Classical, bluegrass, electric rock."
"Anyway, when we ran out of money, we stopped here and I got a job dealing blackjack at Caesars."
"The next thing I know, this mysterious man, the one you look so much like, Garthe, he wouldn't leave me alone."
"Flowers every day, gifts."
One of the gifts was a job for Ron.
The plot thickens.
I suppose so.
I sure didn't see it at the time.
Ron did odd jobs for him.
It all began so innocently.
And we went out twice.
A limo to pick me up.
Carte blanche at the best shops in town.
So many flowers sent to the apartment that Ron's old allergies came back.
"Well, it sounds all right to me."
All except for the allergies.
What happened?
"I've always believed in love and romance, pretty much in that order."
Garthe made it clear that he didn't.
He prefers to buy what he wants.
"Okay, I think I get the picture."
Ron gets suspicious of Garthe.
"Whatever he found out or overheard went into a tape recorder, and the tapes he hid in a locker right before he disappeared."
"I know it's not much to go on, but it's all I've got."
"Michael, something's happened to him and Garthe's behind it, I know it."
"All right, I'll see what I can do."
The key...
Pardon?
You said you'd found the key to the locker.
"Do you know what ""antithesis"" means?"
"""Antithesis""?"
Why are you asking all this?
It's strange.
"The deceased comes to visit, stays only 20 minutes and leaves all alone a very sick girl."
"And speaking plainly, Mrs. MacNeil it isn't likely he would fall from a window."
"Besides, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found."
Except maybe one chance in a thousand.
No.
My hunch....
My opinion he was killed by a very powerful man:
point one.
"And the fracturing of his skull: point two plus the various other things we mentioned would make it very probable probable, not certain that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window."
"But nobody was in the room except your daughter, so how can this be?"
It could be one way.
If someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned.
"Judas Priest, just a second."
The servants?
They have visitors?
Not at all.
"You were expecting a package that day, some delivery?"
Not that I know of.
"Groceries, cleaning...a package?"
I really wouldn't know.
Karl takes care of all that.
I see.
Would you like to ask him?
"No, never mind, it's it's very remote."
"No, never mind."
Would you like some more coffee?
Please.
That's cute.
"Your daughter, she's the artist?"
Thank you.
"I'm just going to ring out my shirt and stuff toilet paper up my nose, and I'm sure I'll have no trouble fitting in now."
"So, thanks."
"Dad, we have to think about the future here."
The only way a company is going to survive a crisis like this is for the C.E.O. to step down.
"Face it, Caleb, it's time to get your Martha Stewart on."
"There's more police, more reporters, or angry stockholders."
"Julie, hi."
Caleb.
"As soon as I saw the paper, I walked right out of my seaweed wrap, and I came right here."
- That's a heartwarming tale.
- A relaxing weekend at the Montage was exactly what I needed to remind me of what's important
"I know I haven't been there for you, sweetie."
But you haven't been exactly honest with me.
"- Uh, we're going to.."
- It was just getting good.
All right.
Honey...
"When Jimmy went down, our marriage fell apart."
I do not want that to happen to us.
"We're partners, which means we share everything."
"So, put me to work."
What can I do...
"talk to the press, make some calls?"
- Kirsten is taking care of all of that.
"- Well, she can't do everything."
- Surely there's something I can do.
"- There is one thing, but..."
- Name it.
- Food.
"- Since I'm going to be working from home, we're going to need some water, some coffee, some of those pumpkin muffins I like"
"Thanks, JuJu."
"Kirsten, Sandy?"
- Nobody likes finals.
Thank God I'm graduating and it's the last time I cram like this.
My pursuit of higher education has led me... to an interesting discovery about myself.
You wanna hear it?
- Sure.
- I despise academics.
"Learning, knowledge, it's all worthless."
I have no idea what you see in it.
Learning is fun.
"Plus, for me, there's that I'm a minor, so it's mandatory thing."
That's what kills me.
This is self-inflicted.
I'm a masochist.
I might as well be carrying a switch and periodically lacerating myself with it.
That diploma hanging on the wall is going to make this all worthwhile.
I guess.
Unless I turn into John Nash and start drooling on people.
- You're graduating.
- I know.
"No, you're graduating."
There's gonna be a ceremony.
I don't know.
It's a community college.
Community colleges have ceremonies.
My college doesn't even have a lawn.
They won't necessarily have a ceremony.
- They must.
Did you ask?
- No.
"Well, now that you mention it, I think someone said something about... some cheesy ceremony for my business class."
- When is it?
- I don't know.
"Mike, come on -- too dangerous."
"Sam, this whole thing with..."
"losing Elsa, I just..."
"Yeah, well, doing something insanely dangerous won't fix what happened with me and Elsa."
I don't see another way.
"All right, then."
Let's go do something insanely dangerous.
This place is like a black market Costco in here.
"Yeah, well, I'm kind of a big deal."
That's why I'm able to smuggle super-spies to other countries.
"So, guys, what's the plan?"
All right.
Here's how it works.
"Every time you make a delivery from a warehouse,"
"Jabbar finds out, right?"
"Yeah -- come looking for me, and then they steal everything."
"Okay, so, now you're gonna call in a pickup from this warehouse."
"Only this time, Jabbar's guys are gonna find a very unhappy ex-employee of yours here."
E-e-ex-employee?
What --
That's what Mike and Fi are setting up in your office.
Mike gets the guys to take him to Jabbar.
We sic the FBI on him -- problem solved.
"Oh, problem solved."
You guys just skipped over the part where I lose everything I own!
Shut up.
"Listen, Mike's doing the hard part here, okay?"
"All you have to do is make the call, wait for Jabbar's guys to show up, and run like hell."
I can't believe I'm even considering this.
I hate this plan.
This is a horrible plan.
Push the button.
- Lord Kim Woo-jing.
"I can see that he harbors great ambitions, but he won't show it."
What is this great ambition?
What other ambition could a royal family member have?
It is to become king.
Please watch your words.
It could be interpreted as him plotting treason.
"It will be treason if he fails, but if he succeeds he will gain the world."
I will do anything if I can put a king on the throne.
You haven't gained your calm yet.
Your sword seemed to be thirsty for blood.
Our plan will fail if you act in haste.
Go to Chunghae at daybreak.
"Yes, sir."
Go to Chunghae?
Jang Bogo's men are guarding every inch of Chunghae.
It is impossible to penetrate into Chunghae.
I have a plan.
Do not worry.
Who are you?
We're pirates from Manwol Island.
We heard that Grand Chief Jang Bogo would spare our lives if we surrendered.
I need to go to Yangzhou.
Why?
I want to bring potters from Yangzhou.
"Kangjin, which is not far from Chunghae, has great soil for pottery making."
I will bring pottery makers and build a kiln.
We need to create jobs for the pirates who surrendered.
"If you open a pottery workshop, I will train them to be potters."
- Grand Chief.
- What is it?
The Manwol pirates have surrendered.
One way or another.
80 miles Northwest of nome... this is all Gonna be easy today.
Let's just get it over there And start making some money.
"Despite being knocked down Repeatedly this season,"
The kellys are off the mat...
- we made it.
- But now their dredge.
Is positioned on the banks Of the kougarok river.
"Gold is really what We're supposed to be making,"
And I'm not making a huge Amount Of gold for my family.
Thanks for Flying the colors.
The flag's up.
Everything's going good.
"I don't have the opportunity To get big gold,"
Not until we increase Our reputation in this town.
Hey-ho!
We got to show we can go Anywhere we need to.
And we're willing to do Anything we need to.
And that we're not Gonna give up.
- You ready?
- Go.
"There it goes, Don't stop, pull!"
"Okay, just calm down, Calm down."
I don't have Rubber boots on.
"Well, neither do I."
"Washed down from Volcanic mountaintops,"
"Gold often collects where There's a change in river flow,"
Including bends And bedrock formations.
"- Okay, get the boat set up."
- Get the hose out.
"This is how it works, okay?"
"I tell you what to do, You do it."
Let's see.
Here it is.
- Have you talked to her?
"- No, and don't go on about it."
"Good-bye, Lydia."
You have to be patient with him.
Work hard.
"""Shrinking Lover."""
Rosa's got the flu.
I hope she didn't give it to you.
I'm glad you're feeling well.
"Even so, I'll give you a massage, and a rubdown with rosemary alcohol."
"No, I'm all right."
Last night I saw a film... that disturbed me.
"It was a love story, between Alfredo, who's a bit overweight, like me, but a nice guy,"
"and Amparo, his girlfriend, who's a scientist."
Amparo is working on an experimental diet formula that will revolutionize the world of nutrition.
"""You're selfish."
"You only think of yourself."""
"""I've got it!"""
"""It could be dangerous."
"I still haven't tested it on humans."""
"""Do you still think I'm selfish?"""
"""It's done wonders for you!"""
"""Don't worry, my love!"""
"""I'll find the antidote!"""
But time went by.
"Despite her efforts, Amparo couldn't find the antidote and poor Alfredo was shrinking daily."
"""I'll always love you."""
"To stop her suffering, Alfredo left."
"He abandoned Madrid and went back to his mother whom he hadn't seen in 10 years, because she was terrible."
He hadn't even told Amparo where she lived.
"You are such a miser man,"
Calvin Kline didn't made underwear like this.
"Don't speak in public, This man... gave me electric shocks."
If electricity gone then hits me on inverter.
"You don't cry, you just ask him."
Tell him about Sunday.
This Sunday or last Sunday?
"Shut up you question answer, speak straight, Pinto!"
"Don't be angry, You don't interfere, Batla Bhai!"
You're like my younger son.
"That's why I am telling you, Who killed your Hira Lal?"
"We killed him, Now that Hira Lal... where he's gone to hide that diamond?"
How do I know?
"You tell me,"
"You must know little little, Your memory has gone week,"
"Which Diamond, which car, she was that car."
Papa!
These two are the same.
"Speak, Where is the diamond?"
"I don't know, very good Chandu, don't tell them, no matter what you lost your life, but don't tell them."
Chandu!
Where is the diamond?
"Stupid, what are you doing, tell them it's in the petrol tank,"
In petrol tank?
"Diamond is mine, diamond is mine."
I bought the car then diamond is mine.
"I came here to buy car, diamond is mine, I have a Gun."
"So diamond is mine, Papa."
"But petrol tank is not opening, Then how could we get the diamond?"
"Ok, all you people turn it down,"
What are you doing?
Vomit!
We'II wait till she's through soaking in the hot tub then I'm gonna inquire if she's acquainted with the napoleonic Code.
"Oh, stanley, don't be so silly."
It looks to me like you been swindled.
"And when you get swindled under NapoIeonic Code, I get swindled too."
I don't like to get swindled.
"Oh, stanley you've no idea how ridiculous you're being when you suggest that my sister  or I or anyone else of our family could have perpetrated a swindle on anyone."
"Oh, come on, now."
Where's the money if the place was sold?
Not sold.
Lost!
-Lost.
-Come here.
-stanley.
-will you just open your eyes to this stuff?
"-What, she got this out of teacher's pay?"
"-Oh, hush."
will you look at these fine feathers and furs that she comes to preen herself in here?
What is this article?
"That's a soIid-goId dress, I believe."
"-Oh, honest."
-This one here.
"What is that, a fox piece?"
-stanley!
-A genuine fur fox a half a mile long.
Where are your fox pieces?
"This is bushy snow-white ones, no less."
Where are your white fox furs?
Those are inexpensive summer furs that blanche has had a Iong time.
I have an acquaintance who deals in this sort of merchandise.
-He's coming to make an appraisal.
"-Don't be such an idiot, stanley."
"Listen, I'm gonna bet you there's a thousand dollars invested in this stuff."
But I'm the one who processed it like this.
It's always interesting to process other people's photographs.
What about this part?
Did you cover part of the negative?
"No I didn't, the negative ends somewhere here."
"Here I didn't expose it, and here I used a light pencil."
Do you recognize me?
Is this a person?
A painting?
"It's not a painting, it's a real man."
"He wasn't naked, even though the picture suggests otherwise."
"He's perfect like this, isn't he?"
"Yes, yes."
"Is this picture called ""vertigo""?"
"Yes well, it's called like this for anecdotic reasons."
Because I saw the film after...
"I took the picture, well it was the same afternoon but.."
"It isn't very related, even though I was..."
I suffered from vertigo while taking it.
I was quite drunk.
This bottle is almost empty.
It's a very strange story.
The story of the shooting of the picture is quite special.
Would you mind telling me?
It's quite obscene.
I was...
In a position...
An embarassing situation with a friend.
Who...
"I lit a cigarette, and he told me..."
"""You're lighting a cigarette now, like an Amsterdam whore..."""
"And I say ""Yes, why not?"""
"- Yes, but not to throw suspicion on him."
The girl was abused and killed and thrown in the harbour.
"If justice is all the perp wants in exchange for Emilie, let's provide it."
- Or what?
- She's right.
We have no leads on Emilie.
And we can't afford to adopt the refined manners of Special Branch.
"I gave him my word, and I believe he'll give us Emilie."
- But we must move now.
"- Yes, indeed."
"You will search the harbour, and Borch will assemble a team."
"No, no, we'll take care of that."
You can take the damned harbour.
"Well, now we seem to be cooperating again."
"He could have been in Copenhagen harbour two hours before he stole the car,"
- and he had plenty of time to hide Emilie.
- Search everything again.
There must be a witness or a camera.
Someone must have seen something.
"We 're trying, but Zeuthen's people are everywhere."
We're surrounded by security guards.
- Brix is trying to change that.
"- OK, what about Borch?"
Are you two OK?
"I know he's the one who fucked up, but he got us back on track when we thought the girl was dead."
"Call me if something turns up, Asbjorn."
It can't come as a surprise that there are things I couldn't tell you.
- Don'!
be like that.
I've been loyal.
"- It's coincidental, I know."
"It meant something to me, what happened over there."
"But, Daaga..."
- It's quite simple.
"Ifyou keep an eye on Vijay Varma, and find out details about  people he meets, then it is possible to identify his informer."
Did you read the news about your friend?
He risked his life in a dangerous chase and seized 8 millions in gold.
This kind of daredevily is his forte.
My friend is a incredible police officer!
He is an incredible police officer.
And you are a remarkable lawyer.
The only difference is that he catches criminals... and I free them.
Doesn't any misunderstanding arise bemeen you mo friends on this regard?
-No way.
No chance.
We don't mix our friendship with our profession.
I can give my life for him.
"Ifyou mo are such friends, please include me in your list too."
Who doesn't need a good friend?
"Madam, I have written your name in my list at first sight."
I must entertain you well.
How about one more coffee?
"No, thanks."
I must say something.
Our friendship seems to be a one way traffic.
ARer that pam I have come a dozen times over to your house.
But you haven't set your foot in my humble home.
Not even once.
There's nothing as such.
Someday I will certainly set my foot at your celestial abode.
Thank you vey much!
I want to speak to Mr Vijay.
Speaking.
Who is it?
All that stuff we put on the table just now?
"Let's talk about it later, okay?"
"Right, yeah."
That's probably a good idea.
When the power's back on and we're not sitting in rubble.
I'm gonna call Kirsten and Sandy.
Where's my jacket?
Gross.
Sorry.
"You know, I've actually stockpiled some rudimentary supplies in case of, you know, the apocalypse or whatever."
Got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights and canned goods.
A space heater.
-And an extra pair of....
-I'm not--
"Hey, couldn't get reception in here."
I'm gonna step out in the hall.
Okay.
Okay.
"Yes, Orange County, as you've probably figured out, that was an earthquake."
"So far, no reports of fatalities."
"But power is out, cell lines are jammed and the roads are for emergency vehicles only."
"As more information comes in, we 'll relay it to you."
"So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put."
"So we got our marching orders, or our staying-put orders."
So no one' s to leave the plaza unless they have to.
What are we gonna do with everyone?
People are scared.
They'll get hungry.
-What about looters?
-We just have to get organized.
"So keep the radio on, gather up anything you think might be useful."
"Well, well, well, wonders will never cease."
Eddie Catflap's been thinking.
Put out some bunting.
Organise a street party.
Let off some fireworks.
Telephone the Queen.
Give everyone a week's holiday.
The man with no brain's been thinking.
Everybody go to the lavatory in amazement.
"You don't know how you wound, Richie, you really don't."
"However, no matter, because you will soon be in pris."
- Pris?
- Pris-on.
You have aided and abetted a robbery in front of Mr Forsyth and 50 mad checkout girls.
I am all right.
I was just the mysteriously handsome bloke in the huge trousers who vanished without a trace.
But you're Richie Rich.
And you'll be going to pris.
"You're not all right, darling, cos I shall squeal."
"Yeah, I shall sing and... and blab..."
Then I might even spill a little bit.
"And I shall buy a lighter sentence with the names of my accomplices - to wit, Edward Catflap."
Then I'll have a face-lift so you can't exact your revenge.
"You'd need a fork-lift truck to lift your face, matey."
"At least I've got a face, not a collage of bogeys and sick."
"Just cos you never get any girlfriends, you think you can take it out on me."
"Me, never get any girlfriends?"
"That's rich, you never get any girlfriends."
I was out with a girl last Wednesday.
"Eddie, that was your mother."
I still got a snog.
- Snog?
"You aren't wrong, Sis."
I'm sorry about before.
It was no problem.
"To tell you the truth, I don't know why you got angry."
Did I say something wrong?
"Hibara-san, you are the only one that I can really talk to."
Please!
Let's be friends.
I am always surprised by your interest and knowledge about the other side.
It sometimes even makes me a litlle embarrassed.
"But, I don't think that people actually seeing that stuff can really be that positive."
"And, I really want to talk to you about different things, Saho-san."
"When you talk about ghosts and other things like that, Saho-san, it is like..."
Like...?
Enenra!
Eh?
No...
Um...
"It is like the more that you try to look to the other side, the more you get caught by a net of smoke, Saho-san."
"You can't see what is really around you, right?"
"But, if you can't see what is going on here, you will never be able to see what is happening on the other side."
Please pay attention to what is happening around you from now on.
I will help you along!
It's gone!
That's funny!
Eh?
I'm so jealous of your way of looking at things!
"You are so funny, Hibara-san!"
I am so happy I got to know you!
Y-Yeah!
I wonder if she is really praising me.
"But, it has been a long time since I have had a conversation like that."
Lewd pervert!
Even the other day...
Your illustrations are really erotic.
"You can't just say that to a girl, s-so suddenly!"
Do you have to get that angry?
I was talking about how I was requesting lewd illustrations from my little sister!
"L-Lewd illustrations are my job, and I like it, so it's okay!"
But you can't talk about stuff like that!
Why?
Th-That's...
"Big Brother, you idiot!"
Dunce!
Light-novel protagonist!
Fine.
I won't say it again.
It's fine if you understand.
"I-In the first place, Big Brother, you're all sorts of no good."
All sorts?
F-For instance...
That's right!
You stay at home too much on days off!
"Writing is my side job, so of course I'd be home working!"
Even during summer vacation?
Right.
"Back then, everything I wrote was getting turned down, so I pulled a lot of all-nighters."
So I forgot to make you meals.
"The despair I felt when meals didn't arrive even after thumping the floor do you know how that feels, Big Brother?"
Come out of your room and eat.
I think I've lost if I leave my room!
"Even if you say it like a famous quote, it's not cool."
"By the way, I noticed you blog and stream stuff."
I-Is that bad?
Try and rest.
"You know, Nathan, the dying have taught me one thing... that you can look death in the face and go on living."
Our mission here is to keep them company.
Keep company with those about to die so that they can depart in peace.
"Great, but what's it got to do with me?"
"Me, my."
"My little consciousness, my little comforts, my little life."
"What about others, Nathan, do you ever think about them?"
And Dennis?
Have you thought about Dennis?
"If you knew he was going to blow his brains out, why didn't you do something?"
Why didn't you try to listen to him?
"Who kept Dennis company so he'd ""depart in peace?"""
"Anyway, how did you know he was going to die?"
"This time I want an answer, none of your..."
- I saw it.
- You saw it?
- Yes.
- How did you see it?
Was it written on his face?
- Yes.
- Yes?
"Listen, I'm beat."
"I didn't sleep last night because of you,"
- and I've got to be at work...
"- Nathan, people who come here, they've already traveled a long road paved with suffering."
But they have had time to prepare themselves.
But often death comes... unexpectedly.
It can't be predicted.
"Yes, I know, yes."
"For instance, say you cross the street at the wrong moment, or the body just gives out..."
just like that.
I remember when I was surrounded by pirates in the hurricane straits.
"We managed to capture them all with just a feather, two eggs, and a barrel of molasses."
I don't want to hear any of your crazy stories now.
This is serious.
- Are we almost there?
- Almost.
But I just picked up a distress signal from the Southern troops.
There's a problem.
Mom!
I'm so happy you're here.
Where's dad?
Unalaq wiped out the entire Southern resistance and captured your father.
I'll get him back.
Where is my mother?
She's in the healing hut.
So many injured.
What happened?
Her soul is trapped in the spirit world.
"Oh, my goodness."
How long has she been away?
Almost a week.
"I've tried to keep her energy flowing, but I can feel her slipping away."
"You're the only one who can help her now, mom."
How much longer can she survive like this?
I don't know.
But she's very strong to have lasted this long.
I talked to the rebels.
They said Unalaq's got the Southern portal surrounded.
Harmonic convergence is only a few hours away.
Then we have to break through the enemy lines ourselves and get to the portal now.
There's no use in talking anymore.
We know what our mission is.
"Hilarious, right?"
Totally.
You look like some suburban mom who drives a minivan filled with stale Cheerios and empty juice boxes... probably makes chili mac and Frito pie for dinner... smells like that menthol cigarette that she snuck while she was waiting to pick her kids up
from hockey practice.
Get over here!
"== sync, corrected by elderman =="
You guys will not believe what just happened.
"On my way here, a taxi jumped the curb and it pinned this old lady."
"And I just went into this, like, crazy adrenaline mode and I somehow lifted it off her."
"Oh, my God."
"Ted, your wrist."
"Oh, yeah, I guess it's a little swollen."
I must've strained it lifting.
I believe our dear friend Lily was referring to your other wrist... the one wearing the male birth control.
"I was gonna go with ""chastity bracelet."""
"God, is it possible to love you more?"
Really?
Really?
"I just saved someone's life, and you guys are focusing on this?"
"Yeah, you know what, guys?"
Leave him alone.
- All right?
He's a hero.
- Thank you.
Do you think that your super strength came from wearing Wonder Woman's magic wrist cuff?
"Yeah, I'll have you know that because of this cuff, I have a date."
With some hand lotion and the Internet?
It is possible to love you more!
She exists.
And she's right outside.
- Great.
"Hmph, monster."
You should have just behaved and stayed shut away in school.
Kiefer...
Is she alive?
She's already been thrown into prison here.
"To begin with, who would have expected her to come back?"
"Years ago, the eldest of her sisters died in a spy crackdown."
The remaining two received our country's reeducation.
"We had the younger sister remain here, as a sign of loyalty to our country."
Wouldn't it be quicker to just say you took her hostage?
She was a foolish girl as well.
"Even though her younger sister is dead since long ago, in the end, she was worthless."
Nothing is accomplished as long as the Astal brat survives.
So he was your real target.
Do you have any idea how much of a reprimand we got from those people?
Is that what you called me here for?
To complain and moan?
"Mind your tongue, monster!"
Ow...
That one hurt a little.
Of course it did!
Are you mocking me?
You're the one doing the mocking here.
I'm always the one being mocked.
I've had enough punishment.
Could you throw me in jail before I drop dead?
"The king will grant one request, with your imprisonment."
"I'd sure like to stop this bleeding, but..."
"Oh, I know."
"Hey, Kiefer."
"If you keep taking afternoon naps, your grades will drop."
What's this?
Hamish. I can't marry you.NYou're not the right man for me.
And there's that troubleNwith your digestion.
but this is my life.Nl'll decide what to do with it. and you be good to her.Nl'll be watching very closely.

You need to talk to someoneNabout these delusions.
Nespecially white ones.
l'll find something usefulNto do with my life.
You two remind me of some funny boysNl met in a dream.

You and I have business to discuss.
Shall we speak in the study?
Oh.
And one more thing.

Why not go all the way to China?

But I've seen that look before. perhaps you'd consider becomingNan apprentice with the company.

"Right again, Jeeves!"
- This is a beautiful spot.
"- It was, sir."
"- What do you mean, ""It was""?"
- I regret to report that that woman is here.
- Woman?
What woman?
- Our visitor of last night.
"Oh, that one."
"Well, that is a coincidence."
"An extraordinary coincidence, sir."
May I suggest for your own good... that we motor on till we come to another hotel?
"Definitely not, Jeeves."
I refused to have my rest interfered by a mere female.
"Frankly, I'm afraid, sir, that we may get involved in another embarrassing situation."
This is different.
Remember what those Scotland Yard men told us about this girl?
It is our duty to remain here and watch her... in case the occasion arises to aid our country.
"Yes, sir."
"I find your patriotism most admirable, sir."
Then you haven't been able to find Mr. McDermott?
"No, not yet."
I'm sorry.
- I hope nothing's happened to him.
"- No, I don't think so."
If you tell me where you found him and about what time... it might help to clear things up.
It was quite late.
I was staying with my aunt in London.
"Oh, I— I see."
I'm beginning to think we should notify the police.
"No, no, no."
That won't be at all necessary.
In Hong Kong.
My crazy-ass brother went and got crazy-ass elective surgery in Hong Kong.
- Who does that?
- Short people.
Desperate short people.
I had my legs lengthened.
I couldn't find a surgeon who would do it here.
"Look, it's barbaric, okay?"
They--they broke his legs and they hooked him up to some sort of medieval torture device.
"Yeah, that's to pull the bones apart."
That's the lengthening process.
It's a controversial procedure.
I don't perform it myself.
- Could I take a look?
- Yeah.
They said it'd give me 2 whole inches.
Any word from UNOS?
Not yet.
Dr. Karev is staying in constant contact with them.
How much longer will we have to wait?
Are--are livers and intestines hard to find?
"Well, Jackson's blood type is O-positive."
It shouldn't be too difficult to match.
"But he's had blood transfusions, which means there could be extra antibodies that are hard to match, so we need to be patient, Melinda."
"In the meantime, um, I need to run some tests on Jackson to check his electrolytes."
"We're gonna do everything we can to help your son, mrs."
Prescott.
All of us.
You.
You're squirrelly.
I'm sorry?
I don't trust you.
"Selena, I'm so very happy for you."
"Selena, I'm so happy for you."
Mother?
"Come on, Norman!"
We finally discovered that season of love... it is only found in someone else's heart.
"Right now,someone you know is looking everywhere for it."
And it's in you.

"Where I was born, time was told not by the clock or the calendar but by the seasons."
Summer was carefree contentment.
Autumn was that bittersweet time of regret for moments that had ended and things that were yet undone.
And then winter fell with a cold mantle of caution and chill.
It nipped our noses and our arrogance and made use move closer to the warm stoves of memory and desire.
Spring was promise.
But there was a fifth season of love and only the wise or the lucky ones knew where to find it.
"Hey, mister, which way to Peyton Place?"
"Go up this road, about two miles."
You'll come right to the town.
Thanks.
Lucas stole my money.
He drinks everything in sight.
I saved for a year and a half for a course.
"Don't go, Paul."
You was my firstborn... .
- Hitting everyone in his way.
Even you.
- Only when he's drinking.
That's been every night.
Why did you marry him?
Um...

"Ma, nothing to worry about."
I spent the day sitting on a rooftop playing sudoku on my phone.
- You can do that?
I need a new phone.
- Yeah.
"I got to go, mom."
Call you later.
"Well, well, well."
I heard you took a bullet.
Do you know how pissed I am that I wasn't there to see that?
"Bunch of us are dropping by the cove, try and wipe the day away."
You gonna come?
Nah.
The thing about a drink after the battle is you got to be in the battle.
"So I'm gonna go home, take a hot bath, and play the most violent video game I can find."
- Later.
- Later.
"Hey, I'm glad you're not dead, butt-head."
Me too.
"The rampage left 12 dead, 23 wounded, and many still in critical condition."
"The alledged gunman, a former I.T. advisor at the company, was evidently embittered over being recently let go"
Due to company downsizing.
He apparently entered the building... that was insane.
"Yes, Glenn."
A man walking into a building and shooting people in the head is the definition of insane.
They give you a nickname over at the station yet?
"We'll call you ""dictionary."" You walking around here defining things."
"I'm just dicking with you, man."
That was a thick one out there.
"You think that was insane, shoulda been at Katrina."
(Clinks and whooshes)
(Cheering and laughing)
What are we gonna do now?
I'll think of something.
- What's funny?
- Russ didn't tell you?
"He told me about the job, but he didn't tell me anything funny."
- He didn't tell you about Pete?
"- No, who's Pete?"
"Well, it seems there's this physician type character named Pete was all depressed one day."
He felt terrible cause he did some stuff he just couldn't get over.
- What did he do?
- He slept with five of his patients.
"But Pete wasn't the worst guy in the universe, because no matter how hard he tried to forget about it, he couldn't."
The guilt and sense of unprofessionalism was overwhelming.
"But every once in a while he hear a voice inside that said: ""Pete, don't worry about it."""
You weren't the first licensed practitioner that sleeps with one of your patients and you won't be the last.
"Besides, you're single."
Let it go.
"But then, just when he almost over the guilt with it all, another voice would bring him back down to reality."
"And say: ""Oh Pete,"
But dude...
"You're a Veterinarian."""
Vi!
Let's go!
Wha..
What are you doing?
- I don't get it.
- Don't get what?
What's so funny about a vegetarian man?
I don't get it.
"Pint of lager, please."
Something local.
- Thank you.
- GLEN:
All right.
"So, a local lager for Mr. Brando and a Caesar for Sandy Bullock."
I love those orders.
Be right back.
I didn't think they'd have it at Four Dancers.
"Yes, I didn't think they'd have it at this resto-bar."
- Gastro-pub.
"- Says ""resto-bar"" on the sign."
It's more of a micro-bistro.
"Says brasserie on the menu right there, too."
It's more of a bistro-brasserie.
When I came in they asked me if I wanted to sit at the resto-bar or the gastro-lounge.
I'm glad you chose the resto-bar.
This is actually the gastro-lounge.
"Do you know what an emergency call is, Wayne?"
- Negative.
"- It's when you have a friend call 10, 15 minutes into a date to be sure the date isn't a total bust."
"And if it is, then you can play the phone call as though it's an emergency and leave the date."
"Well, that's fair."
I guess we are first cousin to an emergency here.
A good one.
And you shouldn't be afraid of it.
I think we could do good things here.
"I'm going to call my friend and cancel her pending emergency call, and when I get back, let's talk about your feelings, Wayne."
- Okay.
- Let's really talk about them.
- Okay.
"- I wanna take 'em, and I wanna talk about them."
[slam] [phone rings]
Hello.
"Oh, Paul."
How's the party?
It died.
So did the hostess.
What do you mean?
"Well, somebody stole the family jewels after all and slipped a knife into Mrs. Langley at the same time."
"Perry, could you come over right away?"
"My responsibility here is to the niece Merle, and the way things are shaping up, the poor kid's going to need help fast."
What kind of help?
"Well, right now, the case depends on who's got those diamonds, which is like looking for a needle in a haystack because this place is enormous."
But there's one place the police haven't looked--
Merle's luggage.
Why not?
They can't find the keys.
"Paul, do you have the keys?"
You guessed it.
Merle slipped them to me with a pleading look.
"Perry, I'd appreciate it if you were here when Lieutenant Anderson forces the locks."
"Okay, Sergeant, thank you very much."
"All right, no one left the party early."
No one has those diamonds in their possession.
So we're starting to search the grounds now and that other house across the way.
Without a search warrant?
"We didn't think you'd mind, Mr. Kirk."
"No, no."
Anytime.
"But in the meantime, this luggage."
"Miss Telford, have you remembered yet what you did with the keys?"
"I lost them, I told you."
Then I'm afraid we'll have to force the--
"I love you, Margaret, but this is my life."
I'll decide what to do with it.
"You're lucky to have my sister for your wife, Lowell, and you be good to her."
I'll be watching very closely.
"There is no prince, Aunt Imogene."
You need to talk to someone about these delusions.
"I happen to love rabbits, especially white ones."
"Don't worry, Mother,"
I'll find something useful to do with my life.
You two remind me of some funny boys I met in a dream.
-You've left me out.
"-No, I haven't, sir."
You and I have business to discuss.
Shall we speak in the study?
Oh.
And one more thing.

"My father told me he planned to expand his trade route to Sumatra and Borneo, but I don't think he was looking far enough."
Why not go all the way to China?
"It's vast, the culture is rich, and we have a foothold in Hong Kong."
"To be the first to trade with China, can you imagine it?"
"You know, if anybody else had said that to me,"
"I'd say, ""You've lost your senses."""
But I've seen that look before.
"Well, as you're not going to be my daughter-in-law, perhaps you'd consider becoming an apprentice with the company."

I brought you some company.
"Oh, he might be a little disoriented, after the way he came out of stasis."
- I know you.
"- Oh, you remember her?"
"Well, his mind isn't fully gone."
Hey!
Stay away from him!
I'm going to kill you.
"You've had 4,000 years to do so, with no success."
What are you doing?
Your blood is the key to unlocking the Thanagarian technology.
- Thanagarian?
- The alien species which gave the three of us our powers.
They sent three meteorites containing technology beyond human understanding.
"When they are activated by your blood,"
"I will be able to erase time itself, and travel us back to 1700 B.C."
- No.
No!
"- I will begin my immortal life anew, only this time"
I won't be content to whisper in the ears of powerful men.
This time I will be the one with the power.
I will be a god.
Please try very hard not to kill me.
Rip.
Please take me back.
I need your help.
I need to save my sister.
"And you know that I would do this for you, Sara, but I just can't."
I've not asked you for anything.
And you of all people should understand.
You have tried everything.
We... we have tried everything
That's your third strike...
before you're 25 years old.
That makes you the goddamn rookie of the year.
I got a little baby at home.
"She need milk and books, man."
Only thing you got at home... is a wide-screen TV you haven't paid for yet!
–Ow!
–Here's your statement.
Sign it.
"Whoa, man."
"What the hell is this, man?"
This is all filled out.
You don't wanna sign?
I'll throw you in County right now on that third strike.
And if I sign this bullshit confession?
"Play ball with us, we'll let you play extra innings."
We know you've been selling stolen goods to Fleetwood Walker.
"Give us a hand, we'll lose this statement."
We'll forget we ever saw you.
Man!
"Oh, my God."
Why would someone do this to her?
Most likely trying to fill a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.
Why would someone fantasize about cutting a woman's arm off?
"Some people derive sexual pleasure... through inflicting physical, emotional abuse."
That's horrible.
"Yes, it is."
How old were you when you met Bob?
–Is he your first boyfriend?

But I'm just a bastard.

"Mr. Neelix, you're with me."
I thinkit's time we contact the Mokra.
"Mr. Paris, set a new course."
Bring us out from behind the moon and establish a standard orbit around the planet... slowly.
We don't want to look aggressive.
"Yes, sir."
What kind of response should we expect when they see us?
The Mokra are paranoid and hostile.
They have little use for diplomacy.
I wouldn't be surprised if they started shooting at us immediately.
We'll be in full view of the planet in a few seconds.
Their orbital sensor net has picked us up.
They're scanning the ship.
We're being hailed.
On screen.
I am Third Magistrate Augris of the Mokra Order.
Commander Chakotay of the Federation Starship Voyager.
May I assume you're seeking permission to conduct business with us?
No.
Some of my crew members have already been to the surface.
We've lost contact with them.
I see.
You must have been unaware of our regulations.
I'll transfer a complete copy for future reference.
I have reason to believe they're being detained.
Detained?
Thas possible.
I'll look into it for you.
I'll contact you shortly.
Thank you.
"So on the one hand, we've got a witchcraft kind of murder and on the other hand, a black mass-type desecration in the church."
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Maybe somebody crazy somebody with a spite against the Church.
Some unconscious rebellion.
"A sick priest, is that it?"
"Look, Father, this is hard for you."
"Please, I understand but for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist."
"You'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't."
"I mean, this kind of sickness, you'd know that."
I don't know anyone who fits that description.
Ah.
Doctor's ethics.
"If you knew, you wouldn't tell, huh?"
"No, I probably wouldn't."
"Not to bother you with trivia, but a psychiatrist in sunny California, no less was put in jail for not telling the police what he knew about a patient."
-Is that a threat?
"-No, I mention it only in passing."
"Incidentally, I mention it only in passing I could always tell the judge it was a matter of confession."
"Hey, Father, wait a minute."
-Do you like movies?
-Very much.
"Well, I get passes to the best shows in town."
"Mrs. K, though, you know, she gets tired, never likes to go."
-That's too bad.
"-Yeah, I hate to go alone."
"I love to talk film discuss, to critique."
You want to see a film with me?
I got passes to the Crest.
It's Othello.
-Who's in it?
-Who's in it?
"Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx."
"I'm not wanted for anything, am I?"
Why don't you two fellows see... if you can get your heads together for a few minutes?
Go ahead.
- Do you know who I am?
- No.
What you used to be in the southwest...
I used to be in the northwest.
How does that work?
"I know that you've been, as I've been, a man hunter."
I was a tracker.
Better still.
John Coble's put in a pretty fervent recommendation for you... to The Cattlemen's Association to help control the rustling.
I believe his point was... handling rustlers after your experience with the Apache wars... should be like shooting fish in a barrel.
"Now, you're talking about... the high side of shooting and the low side of the law."
Bring them to trial if you like.
I feel that what I know about you... you're gonna wanna go ahead and shoot.
"From the standpoint of the Association, that's going to be entirely up to you."
Whether I bring them in or shoot?
Is your problem.
You're a U.S. Marshal.
"You tell me, what's the difference... between a U.S. Marshal and an assassin?"
A Marshal's checks come in on time.
"Say, did Buffalo Bill ever ask you to be in his Wild West Show?"
"Yeah, he asked me once out in Arizona, where we had a lot of people killed."
He offered me my own act.
"Like I said, we had a lot of people killed."
Joe.
- Can I talk with you a minute?
- Sure.
"Man of the West, Indian tracker, and scared to death of lobster."
It was my first time.
What do you...
"Now, he knows that you're part owner of Denver-Carrington."
He's trying to buy up that stock to gain a controlling interest in your company.
So he can drive a wedge between the two of us.
And then what he'll try to do is position you.
So that you have to side with him on anything at all relating to that pipeline.
Doesn't surprise me.
Doesn't surprise me one damn bit.
- Thank you for telling me about it.
"- Oh, well, I hope it helps."
"It does, it all helps."
"Well, I'll talk to you later."
"- Dominique, good morning."
- Good morning.
"Oh, could I see you in my office for a minute, please?"
"- Of course you may, Adam."
- Thank you.
- Please.
- Thank you.
"Dominique, you know Jason Colby's chief counsel, Garrett Boydston."
I knew him once.
"No, thank you."
"Well, I need a complete fix on him."
"How he works, everything."
A personality and career dossier.
Yes.
"I'm sorry, Adam, but I am not in the dossier business this season."
"Look, anything, any little thing you can tell me will help."
"I've got to work with him, and at the moment, I'm flying blind."
I am no authority on Garrett Boydston.
You'll just have to find your spy elsewhere.
Dominique?
I didn't mean to strike a nerve.
"The Great Gatsby, I think it feel really nice to get for the girls."
You might not have to buy too many since all the girls are quitting.
"Andrea last night, Annabel last week."
Don't get me wrong.
I am in love with your book club idea.
I think maybe the girls need a bigger moral boost.
"Something by Dickens, Great Expectations."
Little orphans are so cute.
"I don't think the book choice is the problem,"
"I think we could all use some real fun, like a party, with actual boys."
That's a wonderful idea.
- Seriously?
"- Seriously, I love it."
"A great Gatsby theme party, but educational."
As all parties should be.
"The roaring '20s, what a wonderfully rich historical period."
The fashion and music and prohibition.
"Prohibition, like..."
No liquor?
"I'm sorry, this chapter is not ready for a party with alcohol."
We have to find a place to host because of the rules.
Prohibited co and sociolizing in the house.
We must check the girls' GPA and their house points to see who can attend.
Don't forget about the 11 o'clock curfew.
We could have a dance instructor.
I'm gonna e-mail Nationals and tell them all about it.
They'll be so happy.
So will the girls.
Score one for the pledges.
"We're gonna have to get rid of your handicap, nice shot Bener."
Glad you could make it.
- I didn't know you were golfing today.
That you need it.
"Yeah, well, that's not why I'm doing this."
You sure about that?
"Tell yourself whatever you want, but going into the police station is a suicide mission."
Yeah.
"Be careful, Isaac, 'cause it almost sounds like you care."
Eric?
Jadalla... police found three bodies near the train yards.
"From the description, it sounds like Malik and his team."
"What about their targets, Carter and Grimes?"
Two men were seen fleeing the area.
They could be anywhere by now.
Keep monitoring police networks.
Find Carter and Grimes.
The Americans probably have the list by now.
"Your operation's failed, Jad."
You failed.
So what are you saying...
We should go back home?
"No, we have men and weapons."
"We move now, pick a target and launch our own attack."
We're here to finish what my father started.
"I respect you as his son, but you're not a soldier like him."
Your father fought the enemy from caves while you were studying at oxford.
But I am here now like my father always wanted.
You've told me you loved my father like a brother.
Prove it now.
Help me get the list and launch the sleeper cells.
Hey.
Mr. Harris called me into his office.
He wanted to talk to me before he went to the principal.
"I had to tell him about the text, okay, I had no choice."
She's anointing him with oil.
CARNARVON:
"Now, mind your heads on the way in, it's rather low."
"Morning, Carter."
How's it all going?
We're very busy now.
"If you could just keep clear, I'll be with you when I can."
"Right, yes, of course."
Shall we come back later?
HOWARD:
Yes.
"It is beautiful, isn't it?"
"As soon as Tutankhamun was old enough, his queen was expected to produce a child."
The future of Egypt depended on it.
"Without an heir, the empire could be flung into chaos on the death of the king."
"Incestuous marriage between royals might have made political sense, but producing a healthy child from a union between sister and brother was fraught with risk."
"Tutankhamun's queen, Ankhesamun, miscarried at least twice."
But even dead babies were considered precious.
They were of royal blood.
Each was mummified for eventual burial with their father.
ADAMSON:
Would you make space?
"Go back, come on."
Move out of the way there.
Make space.
Move out of the way.
Come on.
Make way.
Make way there.
Move out of the way.
"Come along now, make way, please."
"You down there, move."
Everything's going to be fine.
"- I don't want you to worry, sweetie."
- I'm not.
- Because it's not going to be like it was with your father.
I'm going to hold this family together.
- Fine.
"Marissa, listen to me."
"I know that there's a lot of uncertainty in our lives right now, but I want you to believe me when I say that Caleb is not going to jail."
"Oh, well, that's a shame, 'cause if Caleb did go to jail, then you'd be out on the street, and I could go back to living with Dad."
- So should we maybe exchange numbers or something?
- For what?
To work on our lab report.
"Oh, uh... no, I already turned it in."
"Don't worry, I put both our names on it."
"You'll get an ""A."""
"- Funny, I thought we were supposed to..."
"- Yeah, I know, but, uh, here's the thing."
"The only reason why I transferred to Harbor was so I could load up on A.P. courses, get accepted into Yale early and never have to look at another cheerleader or water polo player ever again."
- No offense.
"- Okay, I think you got the wrong idea about me."
You think I'm stupid.
"God doesn't give with both hands, so..."
"take the ""A."" Enjoy it."
It's my treat.
- Uh-huh.
- Where are you going?
- Mr. Greenberg?
- Yes?
"That lab report Lindsay handed in, I'm afraid I'm not quite finished with it yet."
"Well, it looks perfect to me."
- Nice work.
You guys make a great team.
We'll definitely talk about that.
Martha.
I was just about to ruin your Sunday and call you in to help me.
"Well, Agent Gaad beat you to it."
What do you need?
"There was a meeting between the D.O.D. And Lockheed... in Alexandria, Virginia, on January 23."
There are surveillance reports on everyone who was at that meeting.
Anything relevant they have from that date I want.
Tell them it's for Stan Beeman... and I have code-word clearance for the project.
I'll get right on it after I finish helping Agent Gaad pack.
"[Gaad] Thank you, Martha."
"Hey, what's going on?"
Getting ready to answer questions in front of the committee.
They told me to expect a call next week... after I testify.
"I feel responsible, sir."
"You are responsible, Agent Beeman."
So am I.
"How can they come here, kill my partner, whoever they want... and you wind up..."
"Well, it seems that when you and I kill someone, we leave evidence."
They don't.
They're better at it than we are.
Patterson... kidnapped by the K.G.B. Right here in our capital city.
We have his sworn testimony... before he disappeared into thin air.
$600?
That was all you had!
Who told you to do it?
The pastor?
His wife?
- No one.
- Stop protecting them.
I'm not protecting anybody!
Why do you think I can't make my own decisions?
I think Mom and your dad are wrong on this one.
I think... .
"I think if you want the operation, it's your hand."
The only one who knows how it feels is you.
Did I really just hear you tell our son that you think he should get the surgery?
_
"This is not what we do, Lena."
"What happened to ""unified front""?"
"- I, honestly, I disagree."
"- Fine, but you do not go undermining me with our son."
- Our son?
- Yes.
Or your son?
"Look, Brandon is 16."
He's old enough to know that we don't always agree on everything.
"And I wanted him to know that if he still believes in this dream, then so do I."
"It's not a dream, Lena, it is a fantasy."
Do you really want to see Brandon devastated again?
We can't protect our kids from disappointment.
"And if it happens, and I'm not entirely convinced that it will in this situation, then we help him, we help him to learn from it."
"Well, you have fun with that, because after all of the disappointments he's had over the last few months,"
I am sick and tired of teaching him that lesson.
Hey.
So guess what?
Moms just bought me Dawn of Armageddon 4.
Haven't even played it yet.
We can open it when you come over.
I can't spend the night tonight.
"Oh, ok."
What about Saturday?
I kinda can't sleep over at your house... ever.
What?
"We need our ""A"" game, people."
Now we all know Mystique has a perfect inspection record to uphold.
"So, yes, I'm talking about a sanitary food preparation environment."
But I'm also talking about something bigger.
I'm talking about pride.
"Okay, on to the walk-in."
Let's monitor those cold-holding temperatures.
Thanks for coming.
I just...
I didn't know what to do.
It's freezing.
"What do you guys got the A.C. On, high?"
That's part of the problem.
"Yeah, take a look at this."
"[Shudders] Got the heater turned all the way up, but..."
But still this ungodly chill.
"With all due respect, Mr. And Mrs. Burke, just because your thermostat's broken doesn't mean that there's a ghost in your suite."
It's not just the thermostat.
"The last few nights, the lights, the TV, they turn on and off without us doing anything."
We haven't slept a wink.
I knew it was a mistake to buy this place furnished.
[Mrs. Burke] It's spooky.
It's like her presence is still here.
"Look, uh..."
[Clears Throat]
I know there's probably a logical explanation for all this.
"But my wife, she's a little superstitious, you understand."
Of course.
Of course.
"Well, lucky for you my friend Mike here is an expert at this stuff."
"Mike, you wanna take a look at the thermostat?"
I'll call Maintenance.
# Can we say we'll do desserts all round...?
#
"Oh, yes..."
# Ices in the chiller only got vanilla
# Or the sweet for which we are renowned
# In shit hole or in chateau
# They know Black Forest Gateau
# Though ours has never been too near Berlin
# It's wrong to brag
# It's just cake in drag
"# But it's ""gateau"" at the Berni Inn"
# On my grave will be chipped by a monumental mason
# There could never be a better life than Frank's
"# Had a wife had a child, had an avocado basin"
# Bath and lavatory from Armitage Shanks
# And it feels so sweet to have given you this treat
# And that is why we felt we must insist
# That we journey in to the Berni Inn
# To demonstrate the life you've missed... #
Sorry.
Can I just stop you a second?
We're leaving.
"We don't want to spend any more time with you this evening, or ever."
You're not staying for coffee?
It's Irish coffee.
After-dinner mints come with.
"No, we're going for a nice cup of tea."
Tea?
I just felt he was belittling me.
"Well, us."
"He was trying, but we shall not be belittled."
We shall fight them in the chip shop.
"At the end of the conversation, y'all,"
"I kid you not, he says,"
"""And I impregnated America."""
"I said, ""Worth it."""
This whole conversation was worth it to hear Kanye West say he took his penis and fornicated with the United States of America.
My life is fucking awesome.
"I said, ""Thank you, Kanye."""
It's amazing.
"He's--I'm telling you though, he's a cool dude, man."
"There's nothing bad between-- He's a very cool guy, very nice dude, you know?"
There's no beef whatsoever.
"And when I met him, I was star-struck, and that does not happen a lot."
'Cause One Direction came to SNL.
Nobody cared.
It was so funny.
We did a shoot with them.
"It was 200 extra girls, and it was One Direction."
"As soon as the girls saw One Direction, they just lost it, they lost it."
"They were like, ""Aaahh!"""
"I was like, ""Y'all are 11."
"""You shouldn't be touching yourselves like that."
"I'm feeling very uncomfortable right now."""
They got escorted out.
One Direction leaves.
I went to where the 200 girls were standing.
"I kid you not, y'all."
It smelled just like farts.
Do you know what that means?
"That means they were so excited to meet One Direction, they almost shit themselves."
"Now, that's a different type of fame for your ass."
"I know about famous, but not shit famous, right?"
"I ain't never had somebody come up to me and be like,"
"Obsolete brand, slight yellowing."
But the ink you used... the ink told us the rest.
"We extracted the ink from the note, Kevin."
"From 1969 to 1994, consumer ink was infused with a Coumarin compound."
It's a plant extract.
They're called chemical date tags.
Determine the compound and get the year the ink was manufactured.
"Once the ink's extracted, it's analyzed with thin layer chromatography."
The tags react to ultraviolet light.
"Which shows the ink on your note was made of compounds C, A, and B."
Which is unique to only one year : 1990.
"And the writing, unique to one person."
You.
Krystal Sneed's Class of '90 yearbook.
Which you signed.
We matched the handwriting to your note.
"""I know about the curve."
"You're a dead man. """
He stole the science midterm test.
Got a bogus 98.
Set the curve for the rest of us.
"Made my 91 look like a ""C""."
Kept me out of Vanderbilt.
And you waited 15 years for revenge.
What ?
I
- I didn't kill him.
Krystal told our homicide detective that she saw you and Patrick arguing right before he was killed.
Kevin.
Bro.
"Always expected you to show up at Vanderbilt, and, uh, follow through on your threat."
You kept that ?
- Figure it out.
"- Yeah, figures it out."
Don't you tell me to figure it out.
Yous are the ones should figure it out.
"All you have to do is sit down with a matchmaker, answer a few questions, and then she sets you up on three dates with girls that she thinks you'll jive with."
Has anyone heard from Jivin' Pete lately?
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
"No, Jivin' Pete's one nut got all swole up..."
I don't give a shit about Jivin' Pete's one nut.
"No, no, this is a story about Jivin' Pete's other nut."
"Yeah, Jivin' Pete's had himself a botched vasectomy a little while back, so now his one nut's there all swole up bigger than the first nut that was all swole up."
If you can believes that nonsense.
Was Jivin' showin' it to people again?
"Oh, he's showin' it to people."
I seen it.
"- You seen it, Dary?"
"- Oh, I seen it."
"- Yeah, I never seen it."
- It looks like a rambutan.
"Which is to say, this hairy fruit."
"So, not smooth like a persimmon?"
DAN:
"No, although it is about the size of a persimmons."
"Which, of course, is much like a tomatoes."
"What sort of potent peace pipe was some prick pulling off when he titled tomatoes ""fruits""?"
Well...
"Now both Jivin' Pete's nuts have a story, which I hope guarantees that I'll never have to listen to another story about Jivin' Pete's nuts."
- He's a good guy.
- He's a real good guy.
"- No, he's a great guy."
- Wayne.
You're looking for love.
"I got the report, but they're not some lowly weapons dealer at a local market."
No one knows how deeply connected they are with anyone.
"I know that you, Alpha team, have no fear, but... they have neither fear nor law."
You cannot pretend to be the UN to cross the border anymore.
"They know now, and have even dispatched the Korean army to patrol the border!"
We switched over.
Take it easy.
"If things go bad, there's only so much I can do."
"Well, you know"
I have my people in high positions.
Dead presidents.
Congratulations.
You just got promoted.
Don't forget your present.
They were smuggling arms (weaponry).
"In other words, merchants of death."
It's best not to run into them.
"Hey, you know better."
You and I both don't have much longer til we go back.
"If you go back, you will get promoted."
I will get promoted as well.
Let's avoid things that can be avoided.
Alright?
"Yes, I understand!"
Write the report with detail.
"Yes, I understand."
And take this.
There is an order for an urgent transfer.
For Master Sergeant Seo?
It's an order to report to the Special Forces by the Commander of the Special Forces.
I understand.
You may go.
One of Sam's whales won 300 grand at a private table.
And he's back at it today.
But I checked the tape and everything's on the up-and-up.
Just one of those runs.
Right.
Look.
"I don't want Monica finding out about these phony chips, all right?"
She owns the place.
Kinda hard to keep her out of the loop.
"Unless she's preoccupied with some other major crisis like, uh, this dealer who can't seem to deal a losing hand."
"I'm just afraid, Mike, that if she finds out about it, the wrong heads can roll."
You know?
Like mine?
I don't want the cops involved.
Not yet anyway.
Not until we get our money back.
- Mr. Deline.
"- How are you, Sarasvati?"
Good.
They told me you needed to see me right away.
Right.
"The, um, daily revenue reports, when are they scheduled to go out?"
"An hour or so, but if you need it sooner-"
"No, no, no."
"Actually, I'd like the distribution delayed till I tell you."
"Mr. Deline, under normal circumstances,"
"I would gladly accommodate your request, but Miss Mancuso had already requested-"
You just tell Miss Mancuso that it was my decision.
We don't want her to find out about the counterfeit chips.
Oh.
It's very hard for me to be duplicitous.
Which is why we love you.
"Whatever it is, it's out of your jurisdiction."
This man is not a prisoner of war.
Not anymore.
He's a saboteur.
He's a prisoner of war until you can prove sabotage.
I didn't do it.
I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
"Come now, you threw a time bomb."
How could I have had a time bomb?
They searched me when they took me prisoner.
"And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely."
All I know is he did it.
I am satisfied.
I am not.
"According to the Geneva Convention, this man-- ls there anything in the Geneva Convention that'll let a guy sleep?"
- You were saying?
-Simply this.
After the hostilities are ended there will be such a thing as a war crimes commission.
"If the man should be convicted without proper proof you will be held responsible, Oberst von Scherbach."
- Interesting.
-isn't it?
Very well.
If you insist on details I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb.
"Good day, sir."
You will forgive me for receiving you like this.
Perfectly all right.
I do not like boots.
Schulz!
I believe it.
I believe it.
Let's have your dog tags for the Christmas tree.
What's the idea?
Many ended up lying on the street covered in blood.
"In Australia, over a hundred soldiers had to..."
I don't think they'll buy it.
When do you think it'll get sold?
"It would be a miracle, it's been so long..."
Don't you get bored?
No.
Can you come tonight?
Ok...
"Bring some milk, I ran out."
"Ok, see you later..."
Bye.
"Good evening, and welcome to the Bombay the next song is one of my favorites I hope you like it."
Thanks... and now a song dedicated by La Loba
"No thanks, I'm done for today."
"The only thing we have left is the spirit... and woman, right?"
She applies the real Ten Commandments:
"Give me, I need, you owe, you have to pay, I saw, I liked, I want, buy it and you are screwed."
You can't do anything about it.
"It's like when we ask forthe dinner, right?"
"We are tired and we ask how is it going How was your day, honey?"
And they are always grouchy.
- Do you really want to know?
No man!
"It's hard to deal with them every day but it's life's circle; in which we have to live and exist, don't you think, Miss?"
"- Hey, Beto!"
"- Hey, beautiful!"
I don't get why living in this mansion we have to fuck in this room...
Did you like my stockings?
"Yes, they are cool."
"I have really nice legs, right?"
- Legs are not important.
"Thank you, brother Hung."
Don't mention it.
"As told by Chan Mon-gut,"
I will take good care of you.
Beat him severely!
Court.
My master is really great.
My master is really great.
Please ask the candidates for the jury to come for the election.
"Mr. Cheung Ti-sung, you are handicapped,"
I would like to dispense you from serving the jury.
Objection!
Why do you object?
It's against the spirit of law for despising handicapped people.
"Although I am blind,"
I am always a righteous and fair person.
My wish is to become a jury member.
"If you don't let me join the jury, I'll complain against you."
"Alright, I'll let you do it."
Thank you.
"We have jury and judge here, actually, who will be in-charge of the court?"
Yup.
"So, do you think that is an answer?"
Well.
Prosecutor.
Jury.
"In the coming few days,"
I'll disclose the most ugly face of human beings in front of you.
This is a terrifying and shameless homicide.
The accused Ho Foon had secret affair with the victim's wife Yuk.
"He seduced the victim's wife, and he was well-planned to possess Yuk too."
He asked Ho Chun to meet him and then killed him.
"Yes, I am."
Recognize him?
"No, I don't."
I recognize him.
He was one of those Heng-In soldiers we met during a weapons trade the last time.
Why would they want to hurt me?
"Even if it were for revenge, it's impossible for Heng-In troops to attack the fleet."
Doing so would spell disaster for diplomacy between our country and theirs.
Why are you the only one back?
We were defeated by the guards.
WHAT?
!
YOU USELESS FOOL!
Of all things...
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"
I want all the troops assembled at once.
"Yes, sir."
Damn it!
Any news?
The commander who represented Heng-In during that transaction was a man called Bae-Mang.
He defied orders and tried to embezzle the gold and weaponry that was to be used in exchange for our goods.
"His act was brought to light, and he was stripped of his position."
He then gathered a group of followers and renegaded.
A renegade?
You're saying those people after Miss are outlaws?
Yes.
I should have killed them all when I had the chance.
That's not all.
"They might be outlaws, but they were also soldiers and officers trained in the Heng-In Military."
"They will be well-trained, and battle hardy."
This is bad.
We cannot match their calibre.
Thanks again for leaving the Earl for me.
"Oh, well, there are dozens of royals, but I only have one sister, and there'll be other men."
Please tell me sex is better than caviar.
They're both better with vodka.
"But if I could offer a piece of big sister advice, when it comes to men, be patient."
You may have to kiss a lot frogs before you find your prince.
Pardon me.
Or not.
I believe you left your boot wheel behind.
"Oh, Joy, it's like Cinderella."
"Oh, sweetie, I don't think he's here for me."
"Yes, while you're both extremely charming women..."
- you don't have to.
- Right.
"I thought it was very lovely the way you left the party early to take care of your sister, but I wanted to get to know you better."
Would you consider joining me for a drink?
I'd love to.
"Ooh, would you give me a minute?"
- I'll meet you by the car.
- Of course.
"""What a bizarre house, it even doesn't have a bell!"""
"""Tell me."""
"""Good evening, we are members of Federal Cop"""
"""we would like to ask you some questions about a missing guy."""
"""They say that he was with you the last time he was seen."""
"""Could we get in?"""
"""Yes..."""
"""Thank you."""
Previously on Remedy...
Come to Dallas with me.
You had to wash them all by hand when you got back from the tour?
"Like, really big bugs."
We're talking 30 pounds worth.
That's how much more the costumes weighed when you came back.
See?
Here on the bills of lading.
"Uh, we bought a couple of costumes."
"Mimi, don't you think we would have checked that out before we brought you in?"
"What you did, Mimi, was you bought a few bricks of coke in South America."
"And you dissolved them in water, and then you dipped the costumes in them."
"And then when you got back, you soaked the costumes, and then you let the water evaporate, and, bingo!"
Cocaine.
"Oh, god, oh, god."
"Oh, god, oh, god, I'm sorry."
I'm sorry.
"Okay, me and George, we've been trying to get a down payment on a place, so George had a friend who knows some people in Iman..."
"All right, yeah."
Did Laura know what you were doing?
"Oh, my god."
"No, no, no, no, no."
Nobody knew.
"Mimi, she had coke all over her hands when we found her."
She must have grabbed onto one of the costumes
- when she was hiding in the racks.
- Hiding?
"Yeah, she was hiding back there with Maestro Reinhardt, ""Fearsome Phil""."
"They were, they were having some kind of a fight about something."
What were they talking about?
"He was yelling it was his decision, he decides."
"And then he just yelled at us, and then he left."
And what about Laura?
"She came out right after that, and she looked really upset."
"- A neurosurgeon, one of the finest on staff."
- I want to speak to him.
"He's waiting for us, Mrs. Rickman."
I don't judge the living or the dead.
Antibus.
"I grant wishes, prayers and dreams."
Guardian of the gate.
Am I going to die?
This is Kingdom Hospital... which stands on uneasy ground.
"Here, the cold and damp have returned."
And as the gate swings open... the dead may also return.
"I'm going to give you a few moments alone with your husband now, if you'd like that."
- Would you like that?
- Yes.
"- I would like that, Doctor..."
- Hook.
"Now, you can speak to your husband, but... he will almost certainly not answer... although he may open his eyes."
Is he in a coma?
"He's not conscious or responsive now, but that is not unusual after trauma and surgery."
"Now, time may prove me wrong, but I don't expect him to be in a coma."
Is he awful?
No.
"You handled that brilliantly, Hook."
And thanks for putting him in the...
The Presidential Suite is what they call it up here.
Excuse me.
"I'll just let you handle this, then, shall I?"
Make one of the Kingdom apartments available to her... if that's appropriate.
There are lots of vacancies.
Peter?
Look at you.
Just look at you.
Christopher!
"Cause of death appears to be blunt force trauma to the head, neck, chest."
It's consistent with an impact of over 100 miles an hour.
"Oh, it's like he never slowed down."
And the only silver lining is the death is likely instantaneous.
He didn't suffer.
PRIDE:
Possible he had a medical condition?
Heart attack?
Stroke?
He's awfully young.
"But I'll know more after the autopsy, and I'll do a tox screen for drugs and alcohol."
SEBASTIAN:
"Hey, boss."
"Oh, wait, nobody calls you ""boss,"""
do they?
It's too informal.
"I get it, it's no way to start a relationship."
"Sebastian, we're not starting a relationship, okay?"
We've known each other for years.
"Yeah, but not as employer and employee."
"That's a whole different dynamic, sir."
"""Sir"" doesn't sound right, either."
You sure about making this guy an agent?
"I find that hurtful, you know, right here."
"The case, Sebastian."
Right.
"Yeah, well, uh, it's really simple, I guess, at least on the surface."
"Car was going too fast, couldn't make the turn."
Don't really need fancy forensics to figure that part out.
Any signs of sabotage?
Not yet.
Marrying her is out of the question.
You don't even know a thing like that?
"According to Mendel's laws, there's a high probability... for the offspring of a consanguineous marriage to be recessive."
"In terms of eugenics, absolutely."
The eyes of the snake.
The eyes that Suzukichi drew.
See that?
Those eyes are...
"Grandma is there, too."
What are they doing?
They are chanting Buddhist sutras.
"Now and then, old ladies get together and hold a religious service... for the souls of the departed."
That's why there's no Buddhist altar at home.
It's already August.
The day of the atomic bomb is coming.
August 9.
Grandpa's death day.
I see there are other people who have the same kind of idea as Grandma.
There are quite a few old people like that around here.
Suzukichi was one of them.
Although the point where the atom bomb was dropped is quite far from here.
Snake eyes?
The eyes on Suzukichi's drawing... are not snake eyes.
They are the eyes of the flash.
That's right.
"Around here... on that day, when we heard the air raid siren..."
Suzukichi and me were looking... towards Nagasaki over that mountain.
Both of us standing right here.
"Suddenly, the sky split in half and glared at us."
A big eye... peeped through the crack.
The big eye... glared fiercely... at both of us.
We just looked at the sky like we were frozen.
I always wonder about women who chase men who so obviously don't wanna get caught.
You ever ask yourself that about Gillian?
You're not being fair to her.
"Well, we heard that you hacked a statue into pieces during a rehearsal."
I don't censor myself during my creative process.
Wasn't it because Gillian got a line wrong?
I want to know why you brought me down here if I can't speak to him.
"It's been happening more often, lately, had..."
"Wait, I want to hear what my husband's saying."
"I'm afraid not, Ms. Booth."
Detective Logan's already stretching the rules having you in here at all.
But this just cruel.
And it's Mrs. Reinhardt.
"What do you say, captain?"
There's no secrets between husbands and wives.
That's correct.
No secrets.
"Actually, this is the report from the emergency room doctor who examined her."
It confirms what the police officer observed.
What doctor is she talking about?
Is this about Laura?
"No, it's the doctor who examined you in Queens."
You have no right to show him that.
No secrets.
That's what you said.
I don't understand.
What's wrong with her?
"Well, she has the same disease that killed her father and uncle."
This is a summary of their autopsies.
It describes pretty clearly the course of the disease.
How can you...
Don't show him that.
"Well, whenever i was in a fix, jim, i'd just try to figure out what you'd do."
I want to know.
"Trying to flatter me, eh?"
"Well, i was looking and listening around."
"About a year ago, i found out these smart boston bankers was swapping golr money."
Ney.
"$400 in gold was fetching $1,000 in greenbacks."
Sure.
Those bankers were on the inside track.
"They knew that when the war was over, the government would stand back of that paper money."
"Well, i says to myself, i says, ""jim fisk wouldn't stand by"
"""and watch that gold rot in that bank, would he?"
"""Of course he wouldn't."
"Why, jim fisk's smarter than any back-bay banker that ever banked!"""
"Wait a minute, wait a minute- you changed our gold to greenbacks?"
Uh-huh.
Jehoshaphat!
"Did i do right, jim?"
Did you do right?
It's more than $2 million!
$2 million?
We'll buy the stonington railroad!
2 million cartwheels!
Wait a minute- that ain't all.
Huh?
What?
"Well... when i got all this money together, it looked like an awful lot of greenbacks, so i said, ""what would jim think about this?"
"""Shucks, to a big man like him it'd look like a wad of lettuce."
"""Why, jim would say it's a sacrilegious crime to let that lettuce lay there and go to seed,"""
"so... well, i bought bonds."
Bonds?
Bonds?
Yeah.
Lindsay?
Thank you.
I'm sorry for disturbing you.
What's this about?
I'm afraid I've heard that you've been absent from work.
"I'm concerned that you're not coping and, if you were to get into trouble again, you'd return to prison."
- I'm never going back to prison.
- Mm.
But you can't afford to lose that job.
What did you expect for ten quid?
I was trying to help you.
20.
Don't you try making up any lies about this because it's all on video.
You can't do that!
It's illegal!
"You're saying that I can't record you without your prior knowledge, as a breach of Article 8 of the Human Rights Act?"
I'll take your Human Rights Act and I'll raise you Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and your offence under that act carries a maximum prison sentence of five years.
I'll see you in court.
Where's Maneet?
"Off sick, I heard."
Some forensics I've asked her to chase up.
It'll just have to wait.
"Oh, Kate's got a postmortem report for you, if you're interested."
Thanks.
"Yeah, if you just get a couple of..."
You've got a new PM on Oliver Stephens-Lloyd?
Yeah.
Are you going to get round to telling me?
Yeah.
The new autopsy found significant differences from the original.
Both arms were broken and there was a severe skull fracture.
It's been a Iong time.
I can't remember all of it.
Do you understand the Iyrics?
"No, I simply learned it by heart."
I think it's a childrens song.
A lullaby...
My sister and I used to sing a song.
We had two versions.
One we sang to our mother.
About the countryside and flowers.
The other I made up with my sister.
We only sang it when we were alone.
It went something like:
"""My slut mother fucked a bishop... in Heaven, they ate a piano and two children..."""
It rhymed in Hungarian.
It was funny.
Why tell me about your childhood?
To entertain you.
"When he was told of his impending execution, he accepted it with resignation."
Like sort of a relief.
From confessing to all the crimes.
"The real ones, as well as those"
I think were products of his fantasy.
He was taken to the firing squad at dawn.
Among those present:
"his defense lawyer, the judge who sentenced him, a priest... although he didn't ask for one... and a firing squad of 10 soldiers."
Only half of them fired real bullets.
The others shot blanks.
"That way, no one knew who fired the fatal shot."
I was present at the firing of the rifles.
He collapsed onto the ground.
The squad leader approached him.
"Good luck, 'cause it was here when I moved in."
"So, what are you doing with this sofa?"
"I tried to give it to goodwill, but apparently, they have a too many stains policy."
I'm surprised they took your shirts.
"Samuel, it's yours if you want it."
"Uh, thank you, but my roommates and I have more of a southwestern motif."
"You know, now that you're moving in with Molly, we won't be able to hang out like this anymore."
What are you talking about?
You guys can come over there.
It's gonna be my place as much as it is hers.
Hmm.
"Yeah, that's what those Indians thought when they waved at that first boatload of pilgrims."
Exactly.
No more spearing fish and peeing in the woods.
It's tea cakes and Bible lessons for you.
What the hell are you talking about?
Those women are gonna civilize you.
"No more fingers up your nose, no hands down your pants, and forget about sitting on the couch, drinking from a can of pork and beans."
"Please, Carl, I'm not an animal."
I've lived indoors before.
Really?
"You want to lift these couch cushions and play food, filth or fungi?"
Tamale?
Frozen plantain.
I'll eat that.
See?
"Doesn't take up a lot of space, and it fits in with all your Asian decor."
Samsung.
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do with this?
Good question.
Where do you keep your bobbleheads?
"Nothing, bro."
"Or should I say, bro-in-law!"
Congratulations!
You're marrying my sister!
"And you spared no expense, you big crazy!"
You know what?
"I love Barney, but this ring thing sucks."
Some gross guy just brushed up against my rack and then apologized.
"And I think he really, really meant it."
"Oh, sweetie, I know it's nice to be groped by strangers, but nothing beats the rush you get when that one special person looks at you."
It's true.
"Like here in this bar, there's only one thing that I see, and I see her brighter and more clearly than anything else in this world."
You know what that is?
That's love.
And possibly alcohol mixed with some very powerful antibiotics.
And that's how Barney sees you.
And I know that's how you see Barney.
I'd like to start the service with a passage from Ted's dream journal.
"""Drowning."
"""Gasping for air."
"No escape."""
"Wait, is that about Vietnam?"
It's about Whole Foods.
Barney.
We are not getting married.
And those aisles are too narrow!
"But you two have to get married-- otherwise, it's just a cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stand."
"Wait, just to be clear, you're saying you're opposed to cheap, meaningless, disgusting one-night stands?"
Yes.
Barney... don't you see?
Your detox is done!
You're over one-night stands!
But your servant said you were meeting with the king.
So?
It was very late.
"If you're back with him, I think it's a mistake."
I know the chÃ¢teau you claim to stay at in angers
Where you ran into francis.
It burned down last year.
I don't know what happened
"Between the two of you, but I can guess,"
So please don't counsel me on mistakes.
"Come along, girls, be of service to your queen."
Girl:
"oh, my sweetest child god's smile behind your eyes in his hand, in our arms you will find no harm."
Who are you?
Why are you singing that song?
I was told to sing it near you.
By who?
I was paid by another who was paid by a girl...
I don't know who.
She's dead.
That girl is dead.
It's impossible.
The messenger who delivered the news
Of the english queen's death isn't here.
I suppose he knew he'd served his purpose
"And that your invitation was a mere courtesy,"
A thanks for giving us both what we want.
You bribed him to bear false news.
"To get the job done,"
As you failed in that task completely.
You can thank me later.
"the power of love a force from above cleaning my soul flame on, burn desire love with tongues of fire purge the soul make love your goal"
-No.
He didn't tell you what she did?
He didn't mention her.
Priests are pretty tight-mouthed then?
That depends.
-On what?
-The priest.
"I mean, what if a person came to you, you know, that was a murderer or a criminal of some kind and they wanted some kind of help?"
Would you have to turn them in?
"Well, if he came to me for spiritual advice, I'd say no."
-You wouldn't?
"-No, I wouldn't."
But I would try to convince him to turn himself in.
"And, how do you go about getting an exorcism?"
I beg your pardon?
"If a person's, you know, possessed by a demon, or something how do they get an exorcism?"
"First, I'd have to get them into a time machine and get them back to the 1 6th century."
I didn't get you.
"It just doesn't happen anymore, Mrs. MacNeil."
"Oh, yes?"
Since when?
"Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia."
All those things they taught me at Harvard.
"Mrs. MacNeil, since the day I joined the Jesuits I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism."
Not one.
"Yeah, well it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed."
And needs an exorcist.
"Father Karras, it's my little girl."
Then that's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
Why?
I don't understand.
"To begin with, it could make things worse."
Is our solar ray still functional?
"In fact, it's operating at an efficiency rate of 12,000%."
Transfer all available power to the time drive.
"Get ready to eject the meteor, and pray that we have enough power for one last jump."
What happens if only one of these goes off?
Our time will remain intact.
"The world, not so much."
"Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here."
To where?
We'd never get it
- far enough away.
- Maybe the Waverider can.
"Rip, we need..."
where's Rip?
And the meteorite?
Will somebody please tell me what just happened?
Rip?
Sorry if I gave you all a fright.
What happened to the meteor?
"Uh, I flew it into the heart of the sun."
"Well, I angled the ship to eject the meteorite before impact, and then, uh... time jumped away."
- You could have been killed.
- Should have been.
You're a moron.
"Now, who fancies a return trip to 2016?"
- I can't believe it's over.
"- Well, for some of you, yes."
"My journey, it seems, is only just beginning."
How does that work?
Savage is three times dead.
"The Time Masters are no longer of growing concern, due to our destruction of the Oculus."
Someone needs to be responsible for protecting the timeline.
This is awkward.
"Bad career move, in fact."
"Hey, forget it."
What?
I don't need the new shift commander PO'd at me.
It's a woman to woman thing.
- Is this about Beau?
- Yeah.
How does that go?
"Sleep with a cop, sleep with his partner."
I'm the only one who knows.
I'm the only one he told and I made him tell.
And you don't approve?
See it from my end.
"I'm still on the street, closing my cases 100%... because Beau and I are in tune, in sync."
I got Beau covering my back.
"You two can't be a secret forever, it will come out."
"There'll be jokes, snide remarks, bitching about favouritism, and one of you'll be transferred."
"And it's not gonna be the new female shift commander, so that'll leave me solo, with no one except maybe his wife and I to cry on each others shoulders."
What's she like?
"Caucasian, 5"" 6', 105Ibs, no distinguishing marks."
"Nothing distinguishing at all, except a husband who made it out of South Baltimore to become a homicide detective."
It's a world she doesn't understand and can't compete with.
I'm not competing.
That's what winners always say.
She wants him back?
"With all the upstanding, eligible bachelors craving a mother with three small children, what's she need Beau for?"
Frank?
- We may have a witness.
- Witness?
"Yes, she said she saw who killed Marilyn Callisto."
"Oh, yeah, right."
But he's capable of driving a getaway car.
It's funny.
A lot of stuff gets stolen from howard stark...
"Cars, bombs, death rays."
"Actually, the death ray's accounted for."
"It's in nevada, I believe."
Hmm.
You know these men?
Take a good look.
We have reliable information that says
That both of these men were in possession
"Of some of your boss' misdoings,"
And now they're dead.
"Oh, what a pity."
Sounds like you found our thieves.
"Unless, of course, they were working for your boss."
Would you look at that?
"Five minutes in,"
And thompson hasn't knocked out a single tooth.
"Well, don't let this guy fool you."
He may be a butler...
butlers know powerful people.
"If we don't play this just right,"
He'll have a dozen lawyers down here by lunch.
What about the stolen-car report?
Currently lost in the system.
"But if the car was actually stolen,"
We got nothing to use on him.
"Eh, we got something that'll rattle this limey's cage good."
"I'll tell you, you know what I would do"
If the bumper fell off my car while I was committing a crime?
I'd file a stolen-car report.
Then you cook on her.
You ass.
From how long is this going on?
- Why are you hitting her unjustly?
Why are you feeling when I am hitting her?
Why are you talking so with such a great man?
What ?
He is shown concern on you at the hospital and now you are showing on him.
Are you both planning to show me a movie now?
"Hubby, it is ₹ 5 lakhs."
You liked it and bought it at Germany.
I do not care..
"Tukaram sir, you are unnecessarily imagining whatever."
He is a public figure.
But my wife is a private figure.
- You are misunderstanding.
"I am telling as a wife, he is a very great man."
And has also got Padmasri in recognition to that.
Opposition people used this photo to showcase him bad.
"Though your husband looks cunning, you look very genuine."
What do you want me to do?
You should have a press meet and say publicly.
"You want me to make all public, that happened in private till now?"
"Not that he has a relation, but you should say there is no relation."
"Still, what are these issues on our marriage day?"
Your marriage day?
- It is so in the script.
Script?
- In the script written by Lord Brahma.
I will think tonight in my drink whether to come tomorrow or not.
"Karthik, he is over acting a lot."
"- True, sir!"
"Hey, hey, look at this."
You won a prize.
Yeah.
What is that?
Homework.
They're assigning Cosmopolitan as homework?
"No, they assigned this, but I'm getting nowhere with it."
You can't relate that to the real world.
Like how?
"Like, was Mom a virgin when you married her?"
"What are you studying, religion?"
Sex.
Are you going to tell me about Mom or not?
No.
"Boy, that's good coffee."
Fresh brewed?
Instant.
"Now, how 'bout if you love someone?"
Do you have to have sex with them?
This can't be instant.
We ran out of beans.
"And if you kiss a girl, what base is that, and where's the birth canal?"
I have a chart.
"You never have to have sex if you don't want to, kissing a girl's first base, the birth canal's right there, and you shouldn't have sex unless you're in love and probably married."
Why not?
I don't remember-- it has something to do with not wanting to have babies with people you don't know.
It says in this magazine that there's a spot on a woman you can touch to drive her completely insane.
I don't think the magazine's a good idea.
"And in my experience, there is no such place."
Dad.
What?
"When I grow up, do I have to have hair all over my body?"
- Good day.
- Good day.
How can I help you?
I'm collecting for the local children's hospital.
"Would you care to make a donation, however modest?"
"Well, cabinet makers don't make much, but I think I could contribute a little something."
- (coins clinking)
- Every penny counts.
- Do you have children?
"- No, I don't."
It's a shame.
"There was a time when I thought I'd pass my skills on to a son, or a daughter for that matter."
But it wasn't to be.
"50 cents,"
- would that be enough?
- Absolutely.
"You know, you might have more luck in another part of town."
People around here are barely putting food on the table.
"It's not they don't have good hearts, you understand?"
I just don't want my neighbours feeling badly for having to say no to you.
"Of course, it's very thoughtful."
- Thank you for your time.
- Have a good day.
- (coins clinking) - (door closing)
"I started when the poor boy's body was found, and I'm working backwards from there."
I'm down to 1890.
"It's very illuminating, sir, once you drop into the minutiae of it."
Here's a story about a sow that gave birth to 13 piglets.
Now that's a North Kawartha township record.
Very interesting.
"Sir, come look at this."
A farmer reports two British Home Children ran away from his employ:
Now that might be another way to go.
She knows the maestro's innocent because she knows who killed Laura.
Doesn't explain the bite mark.
I still think the teeth looked a little big.
Know what I mean?
The teeth marks could look larger because of the swelling of the wound.
I didn't say it was the only explanation.
"Well, what's option B?"
"According to Laura's dentist, she started a teeth whitening program four months ago."
He took a mold of her teeth... to make her a dental tray for the bleach.
"Listen, Rodgers... what if someone made a mold using Laura's dental tray?"
It would be an exact match of her bite.
Except the teeth would come out a little bigger.
"Thank you, Rodgers."
"DRESSING ROOM OF GILLIAN BOOTH OLD HUDSON OPERA HOUSE TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28"
What is it with showbiz people and freebies?
She's got a subway map for every day of the year.
"Well, some people can never be too prepared."
"Detectives, in here."
"No dental tray or mold, but..."
dental resin.
That's what makeup people use to make fake teeth.
"25 years onstage, Gillian's got a few tricks up her sleeve, huh?"
She wore prosthetic teeth to leave a bite on Philip to match Laura.
She set him up.
That's how she's getting him to the altar.
"And by the power vested in me by the state of New York,"
I pronounce you husband and wife.
"Mr. Reinhardt, you may kiss your bride."
"You'll never regret this, Philip."
I promise.
My Siegfried.
Get up!
Can you handle this?
Henry.
"Why are you hitting yourself, Henry?"
Hmm?
Baby?
"Baby, are you okay?"
I love how protective you are of me.
- You owe me an apology.
- For?
Doubting me.
- I did have certain apprehensions.
- Why'd you let me do it?
I was just entertaining my woman and losing all of my men.
Is everybody dead?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Do you know when I realized this was working?
When?
"When Henry pulled me into the escape pod, trying to get me out of the lab no matter what."
Who would've thought that pussy is a hell of a motivator?
"We'll have a hundred of you tomorrow, a thousand next week."
Each one's first memory will be his wife slipping a cheap brass ring on his finger.
"Every single one of my soldiers will awake willing to do anything my brilliant wife tells him, whether it's marching on Paris or the White House lawn."
I would like to pretend you understand the part you played.
"You didn't make history, Henry."
You helped end it.
You... little... pussy.
That's what my old man called me.
It's like it was my name.
And I proved him right by killing all the wrong people.
"I love you, Henry, and I'll never call you anything but your name, but you gotta decide... are you gonna lay there, swallow that blood in your mouth?"
No credit card or purchase receipts.
I guess he was a cash guy.
I mean if you can call a guy with $31.71 a sh guy.
His clothes were dockers from sears.
No judgments.
"The shirt is a large,the shoes are off-brand."
And his underwear are boxer-briefs.
"Like you wear,gibbs."
"You're fishin',abs."
Are they regular boxers?
Trunks?
Bikinis?
Nothing?
"Mr. Palmer,have you finished the chromatographic analysis of his volatile fatty acid?"
"Yes,doctor."
"Well,let's plug the numbers into the computer and let's how long our friend has been leaking into the topsoil."
"Agent gibbs will be here soon and he will ask... how'd the lance corporal die,doctor?"
"""How he died"" may take me a while."
"Try,""when did he die?"
""" That's my next question."
"That,I can answer."
It's a tricky calcution.
"One has to factor in temperature,soil acidity, and the variety and volume of insects who now call lance corporal finn their home."
Give me a round number.
"92 days,with a three-rcent margin of error."
"It would appear you deserted before you die gibbs,lance corporal finn's fianc?"

"As soon as I know,you'll know."
"Her name is siri albert.She's 25, lives in manassas,and works a physical therapist."
Finn's fianc?
But I'm sure you've got it all.
"Then who did, sir?"
Who else touched the briefcase?
"Sandy, for gosh sakes, if you'd stop worrying about things that aren't important, you wouldn't overlook the things that are."
"Yes, sir."
"I didn't mean to make you angry, sir."
You've already wrecked my evening with that deposit money you forgot.
There was a message waiting for me when I got home.
You should have sent that money to the bank the minute it came in.
"You know our insurance doesn't cover leaving a wad like $45,000 around the office all night."
"But about that $45,000, sir--"
I know you're sorry.
"Well, skip it."
The bank's sending an armored truck to meet me downtown.
They'll take the money off our hands.
"Oh, what are you doing, sir?"
I'm on my way down to the office to turn the money over to them.
"Now goodbye, Sandover."
Go to Phoenix.

"Okay, boys, that's it."
Be right with you.
"Hello, I was given this number to reach Miss Krail tonight."
"Oh, Lita, is that you?"
"Lita, I tried to reach you before to tell you I got your message about double checking that cash that came in today."
"No no no, you don't need to do anything about it."
I'll handle it.
Just wanted to say thanks for calling it to my attention.
That's all.
Am I that easy to you?
Then...
I think I've really gone crazy.
It's good that things turned out this way.
Don't do celebrity documentaries.
"Just do what you like, investigative programs."
I'll find a job for you.
You're unemployed too.
Who's looking for whose job?
I'm going to get a job too!
"If you get a job, should I sign myself up to you too?"
I don't want to see this and that.
What?
You wouldn't starve me and Jik at least.
"Ahjussi, can't you hire me as you wife?"
What did you just say?
"Starting tomorrow instead of plate-of-water unni, another PD would come and film."
"When you threw the ad-lib today, asking her to date you?"
Everyone knows that you did that to chase her away.
"Our chairman is so furious, saying, 'The goby is jumping and the squid is jumping too!"
What kind of PD is she?
'
He said we can't trust our Sin Joon Young to a psycho PD like that.
I gave them the notice.
"Are you fully satisfied with this now, Joon Young?"
And so in that situation what would plate-of-water unni say?
"'Hey you, cockroach of a guy!"
Are you in your right mind or not!
'
While saying that did she have to just accept it then?
"If so, a mere PD would approach a star that would probably be a bigger mess."
Think about it.
"Whenever you've got anything to sell, whether it's a carriage, a steamboat, or an actress, you've got to spruce it up."
Give it sparkle.
I really believe that this is going to help make our corporation look successful.
I'll wear it.
"Wait a minute- gentlemen, please!"
"Now, mr."
Fisk is a busy man.
He'll see you when he gets time.
He sees everybody.
Now will you hoot owls sit down and stop hooting?
"A man gets rich, and it spreads like the itch."
"Now wait, first- all you inventors, please sit over on that side."
All the inventors.
"Sit down, neighbor, please."
"Hey, what are you?"
I'm just plain hungry.
Hungry?
"Well, everybody that's hungry, you sit on that side, please."
Sit down.
Wait a minute- are you an inventor or are you hungry?
Yes.
"Listen, you inventors, hungry or not, you got to sit over there in the patent office, that's on that side."
"Would you mind sitting down, neighbor, please?"
I trusted mr.
"Fisk, and he sat right there and told me an almighty lie."
"Oh, now, uncle daniel, do you think jim fisk would lie to you for $500,000?"
"Yes, i do."
"Yeah, well, so do i."
"What have you got, son?"
I've got an invention that will save you the bother of carrying around matches.
"It's good for pipes, cigars, almost anything."
And the flame is always lit.

70 miles to the east...

Hell yeah!
After an agonizing 13hour journey...
Whoo!
Kris kelly is within sight Of the bluff.
We barely made it.
"If this is half as good As everybody says it is,"
This is gonna be The greatest thing.
That's ever happened To me or my family.
Nobody has this opportunity.
"There's no chance in america You can go and say,"
"""Hey, you go do this, there,"
"And you're gonna make A million dollars."""
Nobody has that chance.
"Now, the only thing Kris has to do."
"Is figure out how to sleep, How to eat, how to mine,"
And how to avoid a mutiny.
"From what I understand, the Left Cholla Navy has researched and developed various ways to fight the enemy at sea."
Then...
Silence!
"Sir, this is not something you should be angry about."
Yi Soon-shin is not our enemy.
We should learn from each other and work together to make the navy stronger.
"Silence, I said!"
Go back to your camps and build some decent galleys for now.
"Whether we fight on land or at sea, we do not need any help from Yi Soon-shin!"
I will fight my own way!
What's the most important thing for an oarsmen?
Teamwork!
You must work together to make the ship glide forward!

Cadence and rhythm!
Do you hear me!
I... have a difficult request.
"I hate to do this, but..."
I'll do it.
I'll get on board with my men.
It's only right that I should row the new Turtle Ship.
Young-gap...!
"That's your request, isn't it?"
Don't worry.
I was going to volunteer if you didn't ask.
The other guys will refuse to do it no matter how safe you say it is.
And there's another reason why I have to do this.
Those poor boys that died out there...
I have to see them off to the peaceful place.
"Once they see the Turtle Ship zipping through the waves, they will finally feel peace."
I should be the on the see them off.
Tomorrow?
No more mozzarella mama...
Since I moved to LA I haven't really had a substantial boyfriend.
I seem to gravitate towards casual relationships of convenience.
Sometimes though I do wish for something more meaningful.
In Los Angeles most people feel like they've never actually arrived.
There's always this chase for something bigger and better.
Consequently no one puts down roots.
No one settles down.
It's like living in this state of perpetual vagrancy.
I want some roots... at least I think I do.
Oh my God did you... did you hear?
Maybe.
"2012, there is this huge planet that is going to crash into earth and kill... everyone!"

Seven is my colleague... roommate...

And I don't think I'm outing him by saying
Seven won't be taking any girls home.
It's all over the internet I'm obsessed with it.
I can't stop reading.
It's kind of scary don't you think?
I mean the end of the world Dale.
I don't know if I can sleep tonight?
Bowie... you wanna snuggle with me?
Huh?
Come here.

"You can rip on him, but you guys are hanging out with him."
Doesn't that make you think maybe your clout at school has slipped a little?
"Stan, you're just jealous of that third grader and you think Wendy's gonna go for him unless you start singing and dancing too."
Yeah.
That isn't true!
"Okay, that's totally true."

Mr. Gueermo?
What?
!
We're from child-protective services.
There's some concern you might be physically abusing your child.
What?
!
Who the hell's been saying that?
!
We got a phone call from a concerned student who wishes to remain anonymous.
His name is Stan Marsh.
You better just turn your asses around and get back in your little car 'cause there's a world of hurt about to come your way.
Mr. Gueermo we need to come in and have a word with your son.
"Oh, by all means."
"You got the balls to come in here, do it."
Do it.
"Hello, Bridon, my name is Mr. Kelly."
"We just wanted to talk to you for a few minutes, if that's okay, and just maybe--"
"Yeah, there it is!"
"Now I know you're looking at me like that's a punk move, but I ain't a punk, I'm a survivor."
"It's a difference, okay?"
"""'Cause if I see a 7'16"" nigga come in here right now, talking about he robbing us..."
I'm switching sides.
I'm just letting you know.
"He gonna be like, ""Everybody, get on the ground."""
"I'm gonna be like, ""Yeah, everybody get on the ground."""
"This is a stickup, bitch."""
'Cause I ain't no punk.
"I'm a survivor, you feel me?"
Even in my woman selection.
That's why I can never mess with somebody like Serena Williams.
Mm-mm.
"That's a big woman, ain't it?"
"She look like the type, as soon as you put your thing in her, she will clinch up every muscle in her body and just detach your penis, right?"
"Somehow suck it up all the way through her body and then spit it out in her hand like,"
"""Pfft, take your little dick back, nigga."""
And would have to sit there and then pick it up and walk off with it.
'Cause you ain't gonna fight her.
Look at her.
She's bigger than an Avatar.
She's humungous.
Mutombo wouldn't sleep with her.
He'd be like...
"""No, no, no, no."
"That bitch, not in my house, no, no, no, no."""
"Speaking of big stuff, I'm sorry, y'all."
I gotta get this out of my pocket.
Look at this big-ass phone.
This don't make no sense.
Y'all remember when phones--
I got ear cancer right now.
Ears boxed.
"Punished with everlasting destruction,"""
"Thessalonians, 1:9."

We're on the same tram tracks here.
I don't believe in God.
"It's just that he had this surprise for you, and I was going to take him out to tea, possibly the Kardomah, because he's been a help to me."
I've got this leg.
Lack of.
What surprise?
It's a photograph of Baker.
I took a little snap of him.
I borrowed a Box Brownie from a chap in my digs.
He didn't want you to think you had to buy the...
The big one because that's going to be sizeable.
"So I thought, after the recording, with it being your day off, we could get the photo, and then maybe go somewhere, as I say, like the Kardomah."
Have egg on toast or beans on toast or toast.
Make a day of it.
He's a good little lad.
You know he's saving up to buy you the record.
I don't suppose you want a cup of tea with a nonbeliever.
"Well, you believe in tea, and, to me, that's only just outside the Holy Trinity."
"Our Lord, Holy Spirit, Jesus, Tea."
Go left and cut through.
It saves you five minutes.
Much appreciated.
So we'll see him tomorrow on his correct tram at the correct time.
You will.
I'll see him off before work.
Go ahead.
Ahem.
You say that the parlors and the dining saloons will be done in solid mahogany?
"Then, mr."
"Howard, all our furniture will be covered with empire plush an inch thick."
"That's right, gentlemen."
"Oh, excuse me, uncle."
Admiring our doorknobs?
No.
I was just coming to ask you if that thimble - rigging vanderbilt's got a hand in this.
The names of our directors will be announced shortly.
Are you in cahoots with that stonington crowd?
Hand and glove.
They've given us all their trade.
I heard you call me your enemy.
"Why, that there just stabbed me to the core."
I'm a pious man.
There ain't an ounce of hatred in my whole carcass.
"Why, mr."
"Fisk, i love my neighbor just as i love myself."
"In that case, uncle daniel, you won't harbor any grudge if we run you out of business."
I forgive you for the harsh words.
"The golden rule brought me to your door, and i'd feel like a heathen if i didn't try to open your eyes to the bottomless pit that's yawning for your fool's gold."
Ahem.
"Good day, mr."
Fisk.
"Good day, sir."
"Ahem, good day."
"You can't run boats no cheaper than me, because i'm losing money every day!"
My steamboats ain't making a cent!
I'm going to give you a chance to save money.
You can buy my boats.
"I don't know why the second, I was a bit taken aback."
He probably meant some comedy role.
"In the end, he made the film without me."
He's a laureate and I don't know what else.
I remembered him once when I was in a bad situation.
"Without money and without hope, and then I realised all the things I could have been, all I could have done."
"That time I noticed a newspaper on the ground, I just pushed it open with my foot and read:"
Krej¨¨¨ªk has become a laureate.
I thought:
"He got twenty thousand, and I'm just rushing around here."
"Mrs Gerta, tune that G!"
is that G alright by you?
Can you hear it?
"- l can't tune it, how am I...?"
- lt must be possible to tune it.
"Yes, but not straight away!"
You should do it before rehearsals.
"Get ready... slacken it... slacken it more, more... lt's okay now."
"That's enough, thank you!"
"If we'd had the kettledrums last time, it'd go better today."
But you have to come to rehearsals occasionally.
"I'm not cross, but I have to remind you."
Once again!
Slightly quicker tempo.
I'll set the tempo.
"One, two, three!"
"- Are you listening, Mi?"

- l'm listening.
When did you get to know Gerta?
"She used to play, that was long ago... I always had a feeling for music."
A girls' orchestra was playing in a coffee house in Prague.
I've been looking in on the doings on your lively little Earth.
Then you've been looking in on the doings 900 years past.
"Oh, really?"
Have I made an error in time?
How fallible of me.
"Oh, I did so want to make you feel at home."
I'm quite proud ofthe detail.
General Trelane--
"Retired, sir."
Just Squire Trelane now.
And you may call me squire.
"Yes, I rather fancy that."
For what purpose... have you imprisoned us here?
Imprisoned?
Nonsense.

"You see, I just finished my studies of your curious and fascinating society."
You came by at the most propitious moment.
"I want to know all about your campaigns, your battles, your missions of conquest."
"Our missions are peaceful, not for conquest."
"When we do battle, it's because we have no choice."
"That's the official story, eh?"
I must ask you to let us go back.
I wouldn't hear of it.
You shall join me in a repast.
"I want to learn all about your feelings on war, killing, and conquest."
Do you know that you're one of the few predator species that preys even on itself?

"Unlike Uncle Hitler behind me,"
I've been holding a shit for three days.
I've reviewed your case file and you should turn state's evidence.
You mean snitch?
"No fucking way, man."
I ain't no snitch.
"No, you're a drug trafficker, and transporting drugs over state lines means if found guilty, you're facing a minimum sentence of nine years in prison."

"Oh, no, no, Larry."

There's a blind spot in the toilets which could be a good thing.
It's the one thing everyone does before they get on a plane.
Didn't you say the front entrance was covered?
"Yeah, I can get you in a different way."
How?
Did a Duke of Edinburgh climbing course on my pupil referral unit.
What was my nickname inside?
"Spider, right?"
Not the nickname I heard.
Grantham Hill Private Airfield
We're done.
I'm gonna go and stay with my sister now.
I assume that we never meet again which is a tragedy I'll just have to learn to live with.
Here are the keys to the flat.
We're not finished yet.
"We had an agreement, Lenny."
"Yeah, but I think you overestimated your ability to insist on dealbreakers though."
You gave me an undertaking
To review.
So consider it under review.
OK.
Fine.
"Send me back to prison, then, please."
We can do that.
"Spencer, if you don't wanna admit what you're doing, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place."
"Bossman, I'm not afraid to talk about anything."
I just thought that that kind of transparency between you and I would put you in an awkward position with the league.
Let me worry about what position I'm in.
"Fine, it's true."
I'm guilty of sniffing in the tall weeds.
With a short snout.
I wanna bring a team to Vegas.
"Reaching for the brass ring, huh?"
"Well, admittedly, it's a little outside of my expertise, but, yes."
"I always knew you had big balls, Spencer, but I didn't know your judgment was this questionable."
How do you figure?
The league's just approved you and you're already biting its hand?
Didn't even call for approval?
That's just plain wrong.
The upside's worth it.
I suppose we'll see.
"The way I see it, there's only one way to take a team to Vegas, and that's big, even by Texas standards."
That's the only way we do it.
"Big takes vision, Spencer."
Do you have a vision?
I do.
"But even if I didn't, Wayne Hastings does."
"- Wayne Hastings, huh?"
- Yeah.
"Well, that boy there's a proven visionary."
He's like the me of Vegas.
"- Oh, you're more handsome."
- I could use your support and definitely your wisdom to get this whole thing done.
"Yeah, approval comes through Texas."
Everybody knows that.
And how far in is Wayne?
It's never good-bye.
Could've been different if the injury didn't occur.
But it did occur.
- And that was the big difference.
- I'm proud of what you did.
- Okay.
- I expect you to do a lot better.
I don't want this to be the-
- Yeah.
"- You know, the highlight of your career."
You've got a lot of bigger and better things to do.
I'll see you later.
Good luck.
"Well... another one walks out the door, and another one comes in the door."
That's what it's all about.
It came through for me.
- Got the score I needed.
- All right.
"And, hey..."
I'm eligible.
"You know, this is one of the greatest feelings in the world."
That's about it.
I mean -
"After five attempts, William's composite score of 17.5... is rounded up to 18... and he can finally accept a scholarship to play at Marquette."
"I think my mom... all through high school really, really was proud of me."
"She said, ""Everybody's throwing their dreams into you... but you got to throw your own dreams into yourself. '"""
"When I gave her the diploma after the graduation... she was, like, ""This is it, one of my proudest moments. '"""
My baby graduated.
"Curtis always wanted to go to Marquette... and his grades weren't good enough for him to go... and now it's like he got the grades,you know?"
"Excuse me, Curtis."
You gonna give anybody else a chance?
What two countries are we competing with for world trade?
He needs to watch the show.
This is the moment he's been waiting for all year.
One where he doesn't feel inadequate or rejected.
So he watches as long as he can.
"Yeah, but fire's unpredictable."
"Every second in here, he's putting his own life at risk."
This guy's obviously confident that he can get out of here before it's too late.
But there was a fire alarm.
My men were here in five minutes.
- And he knew it.
- How?
[Prentiss] This unsub doesn't leave anything to chance.
He knows exactly how long he's got with his victims.
He probably knows response times or at least listens to them.
"[Police Dispatcher] All units, be advised of a robbery in progress at 9760 East Mills."
"[Male Deejay] Yep, this is your man, DJ Cutz, with an instant blast."
"The feds are in town cracking down on this year's Devil's Night, so I'd advise everyone to stay off them streets and keep them radios locked to FM 99 Detroit."
## [Rap]
## [Continues]
"[Reid] The first time I looked at these victims on the map, none of it made sense."
"Seven different victims, various ages, sex, and ethnicity."
- What do you see now?
- The first victim...
- Often tells us the most.
- Tommy Proctor.
"Well, his rap sheet is longer than the Nile."
Looks like he's always walked on the dark side.
The first kill inspired him.
What's different about it?
Two things.
"First of all, his body wasn't found for days."
He was buried deep in the building.
- What are you going to do?
Wait!
"Sorry, I didn't want to make you wait."
"No, no, I arrived early."
- Are you alright?
- Well...
"Sorry, really..."
"Don't worry, maybe there's still time, let's go..."
- Febo!
- Sorry to meet you here.
We're conducting a study on extreme wounds.
We needed test subjects.
To learn how to treat battle wounds.
These were stray dogs.
They would have been killed anyway.
Febo...
"It's not allowed, but I'll put it to sleep."
"It's a sweet, painless sleep."
Why this dreadful silence?
We anesthetize them.
"Don't worry, Mrs. Wyatt, nothing is gonna fall from the ceiling."
We eat here every day.
It is an honor to have a young American guest with us.
Thanks.
The U.S. Army has the same stimulating aroma... as a summer rain in the woods.
Maybe it's the woods still in you.
"It's the way the wind blows, I'm sure."
It's the only occupation army in the history of Naples... that had the courtesy of knocking on our doors... before coming in.
"Judging by the ruins I saw, I think we knocked too strongly."
"That, dear, is an insignificant detail."
"If one has to lose a war, Mrs Wyatt... it is better to be conquered by an army... that has good manners, believe me."
The Duchess is still recovering... from the Barbarian's raid into Imperial Rome.
"I keep refreshing and refreshing to see if they put up the new video yet, but they keep not putting it up, and it's very frustrating."
They'll put it up soon.
They're just trying to build suspense.
"Hey, I brought you a present."
"The person who made it loves her little boy very much, and she put that love into every stitch."
"So when you wear it, maybe you'll feel the love, too."
You want to try it on?
"- Thanks, Uncle Nico."
- Come here.
"Sweetheart, love ya."
I came to tell you I'm sorry about your teacher.
Someone can be a good person and a bad person all at the same time.
"They have to know that everybody in the world is waiting, so why don't they just put it up already?"
"It's very, very, very, very frustrating."
"How's she gonna feel when her daddy's gone, too?"
You have to help him.
"Mom, I think it's gonna go better this time."
Which time?
What are you talking about?
III...
"I didn't want to tell you this, because I was afraid you'd get angry, but..."
I have to.
You know how they never found Susanna's scarf?
Burned up in the fire.
No.
I saw it... two days ago.
- Mom...
- The D.A.'s little girl was waving it out her window like it was aa toy.
"Okay, Mom, one, there's more than one yellow scarf in the world."
"Two, why would the D.A. give his kid 10yearold evidence to play with?"
"And, three... the really big three... you can't stalk the District Attorney's family."
It was Susanna's scarf.
I'm...
I'm wondering if I'm also going to be tangled up in Detective Im's case.
It's true that I hurt your feelings.
I know that as well.
Are you planning on doing something to me too?
I have no idea what you're talking about.
"I would appreciate it if you left me out, Representative."
I only did what I was told.
"Detective Im didn't do anything either, but if he was falsely accused..."
Then it will be easy for you to do the same thing to me.
Who was falsely accused?
"You know better than anyone, that Detective Im did nothing wrong."
- He did... nothing wrong?
- Yes.
- Detective Im didn't commit any crimes.
- He's a murderer.
- That's what you're making them believe.
- That's not true.
"That's not true, this isn't true."
You've created all of this.
He's a murderer.
Im Tae Ho is a murderer.
Do you know what your biggest problem is?
"You're wasting your life doing useless things, thinking useless thoughts."
You can't even pass the exam to become a police officer...
Yet you pass up the opportunity for special employment with the agency.
I didn't know you would do that.
"You think your 20s will last forever, don't you?"
I think you wasting your life is a bigger crime than committing a murder...
Who are you accusing of participating in a murder?
Will it be the same...
as what happened three years ago?
You put it on a meridian of the ear to quit smoking.
My mom tried everything.
Then I'm almost certain it didn't belong to the vic.
His lungs were pink as a baby's.
"Alas, his spine was not in such pristine condition."
"Same marks as on the flesh, but it looks like some sort of thermal burn on the bone."
Kinetic energy.
Whatever the killer used to dismember the body was starting to heat up.
So he must have dismembered the too last.
That explains why we only found burns there.
I also discovered trace in the victim's chest hair.
Looks like sawdust.
"Sawdust.Between that and the thermal burning on the bone,"
I'm thinking some kind of chainsaw.
But what type of chainsaw leaves jagged wounds like this?

Mind if I cut in?
Prostitution?
"Come on, Ms.Love, I got a rap sheet here says you've been arrested four times for solicitation."
"I'll see you next week, George."
"Mm-hmm, okay."
"This isn't what you think, Detective."
"This isn't what you think either, Ms. Love."
I'm not Vice.
I'm with Homicide.
And we have your fingerprint on this acupressure disc.
I bought one of those to quit smoking.
I lost it.
"Well, we found it near this guy."
You know him?
The standing joke of the year...
- Whoo!
- Is this a wake?
No.
He needs to be in the ground for it to be a wake.
This is a celebration.
- Do you see Kevin Grey?
- No.
But I've seen enough.
- Whoo!
- Let's bring her in for questioning.
"Long time, Harry."
"Yes, it is, sir."
I hear you're about to question a suspect in the Freddie Lau murder.
You don't mind if I watch as you interview them?
"No, I don't suppose I will."
"I never expected to find you still here, Harry."
"Forgive me if I'm a little bit confused here but when we ran into you last night, you were having quite a party."
The Chinese attitude to grief is very... different.
Death is pan of the wheel of rebirth.
Away to enlightenment.
So singing '80s classics is your expression of grief?
LAWYER:
Can I remind you my client has come here of her own free will to help with your inquiry?
You're absolutely right and we're very grateful.
"So, Miss Lau, being so close to your father, you would know about his dispute with Kevin Grey."
"You do know Kevin Grey, don't you?"
Course I do.
He used to work for my father and now he works for me.
But I'm not aware of any dispute between them.
"In fact, it was my father who recommended Grey to me."
We were told they had fallen out over a stripper called Kayleigh Fenchurch.
"Yes, but you got to wait in line with the other kids."
"No, you don't, buddy."
"Up you go, champ."
Get your hands off me!
I don't want my picture taken!
Right now.
"The girls asked me to make sure you're feeding him, and here you are pimping him out like... this isn't my wheelhouse."
"Famous pimps, anyone?"
What?
How dare they not trust us.
This stops now!
"Unless your boy, Han, gets a little taste of the horse-play."
Here.
What's going on here?
Nothing.
I know a shady deal when I see one.
I was one of the loudest voices against the Louisiana Purchase.
"Earl, what are you even doing here?"
I thought you lived at the diner.
"Well, thank God the girls asked me to check on Han checking on you too 'cause now this black male is about to blackmail you."
"Okay, Earl's in too."
At a lesser percentage because odds are he'll forget about all of this momentarily.
"Excuse me, manager."
"We've been wronged, and not just generally by life."
I don't know who to complain to about that.
Is there a problem over here?
I'm the pit boss.
I also do the mentalist show in the John Wilkes Booth Ballroom.
Still lots of tickets available.
"Yes, there's a problem here."
"We just got cheated out of our winnings, and I was already cheated out of much of my 20s, but again, probably not your department."
Why don't I send a complimentary bottle of champagne to your room?
Ask him.
"More incredible, he now places the body under a street light."
"Would you do that, Mr Shrimpton?"
"If, in the terribly unlikely event you were to have killed somebody, would you do a runner, or would you take 15 precious minutes to drag the body so that you could place it under a street lamp"
in full view of the street?
"Hey, listen, I haven't killed no-one."
"You've just confessed to the court, Mr Shrimpton, of a Clintonesque interlude with a minor."
"Have you been charged with this offence, Mr Shrimpton?"
No.
Really?
"Have you done another grubby deal with the police, Mr Shrimpton?"
Objection!
I withdraw it.
"Thank you, Your Honour."
That was better than sex.
"Then you're not trying hard enough, cock."
I've gotta make way for another couple of beers.
"Congratulations, your name in the papers yet again."
WOMAN:
Good result.
"Lorton did do it, you know?"
"Well, then, you should have made a better case, mate."
Couldn't.
Hands were tied.
There you go.
You know how your bloke did time for that statutory rape?
"Yeah, he was 19, she was 16."
It was bullshit.
Exactly.
"I kept asking myself how it ever made it to court, so I checked."
Turns out your boy slashed the girl with a knife.
Both breasts.
I'm angry.
I thought it would be a nice surprise if you showed up and saw a friendly face.
"I confided in you, and you took advantage of me."
- Do you know how humiliating this is?
- You don't need to feel humiliated.
I am wearing a silicone ass!
I knew there was something different.
You know what?
"No, no, no."
I don't appreciate your jokes.
I thought you were a decent human being...
Kitty.
Hear me out.
I just felt terrible that you went through all this because my staff made assumptions.
- So you hijacked my date?
- I didn't trust Elise to find anybody good enough for you.
"And rather than have you sit through some awkward meal with a stranger and me at home with my laptop and takeout Thai, I hijacked your date."
- I thought you'd find it charming.
- Charming?
Accept my apology.
"My intentions were noble, albeit my execution was..."
"Lame, ill-conceived, thoughtless?"
"All of the above, yes."
Look.
I can't date you.
I know.
But maybe you could share some red wine and a steak with me as a friend.
Do you have your speech with you?
You want to turn this into a working dinner?
"Yeah, I do."
I think it would make me feel better.
- I already memorized it.
"I told you, guys."
He's been watchin High School Musical over and over again.
"Actually, this is High School Musical 2."
It has a dance-along part.
We said we wouldn't be a part of this fad and look at you!
"Yeah, look at yourself, man!"
"Look, you guys might be fine with being outcasts and hanging out with Scott Malkinson, but I'm not."
"You know what, at least Scott Malkinson has some self-respect!"
At least Scott Malkinson doesn't cave in to peer pressure and start doing musicals!
Scott Malkinson has a lisp and diabetes!
Nobody's gonna let him do a musical!
"That's enough, you guys, it's not cool."
"Lots of kids have diabetes, and you shouldn't be--"
"You shouldn't rip on kids with diabetes, that's not cool."
I'm Scott Malkinson.
"Look, guys, the world is changing."
"We can't fight it, we have to change with it."
"I've been watching these movies and from the looks of it, there's gonna be a lot more singing and dancing when we get to high school."
"And if you think we'll gain any respect by ignoring this thing and be individuals, then think about this-- right now, everyone thinks Butters... is way cooler than any of you."
"That's a low blow, Stan."
"Third team foul on West Jeff Bobcats, m'kay."
Ball goes back over to the Cows.
"All right, you ready to get in there, Bridon?"
!
"I'm ready, coach."
Give em' hell!
Just a minute to go in the first quarter.

"Gosh, what's this?"
You're really spoiling me.
Three days running.
"Well, you know."
It gives me a chance to try some things
I'd never bother with just for myself.
So tuck in.
"I know, but it's time I got my act together."
"I don't want you coming round here every night, do I?"
Whatever.
"So, how's life in the newsroom?"
"Oh, I don't know, Alice."
I think you get too close to it all sometimes.
"You know, we had this op-ed piece today a guy had written about the threat being posed to world peace by the militant Christian right."
"And this is a retired bishop, I have to say."
"And a veteran CND campaigner, you know, the still small voice of calm."
"It was 2,000 words and the editor spiked it 'cause he didn't want to offend the majority of our readers who probably do believe, and I'm quoting, ""The West has a God-given franchise"
"""to impose its creed upon every nation."""
I know.
-War is heck.
-Sorry?
I'm quoting.
"People who can't say the word ""hell"" but have no problem creating it."
"Now, this is delicious."
I sincerely hope that you'll be staying over again tonight.
Is that okay?
Save you the trouble of driving me back.
"Absolutely, and..."
I can have another glass of wine.
Do you know what I was thinking about the other day?
The first time we shared a bed together.
"Oh, God."
Clumsy me.
"But I didn't send anyone after the boy,"
Tendu.
Neither did the people I work for.
They don't even know his name.
GREGSON:
"You had motive, and we have reason to believe that Tendu uncovered the names of all your bosses."
He threatened to expose all of you.
"He did, but he also offered me a deal, which I took."
He's a nice boy.
And I was happy for Libena.
She found her Richard Gere.
"Girls from poor cities, broken homes, they get into the trade because they want to escape, make some money, and someday live the dream."
"Meet a wonderful man, fall in love, live happily ever after, like Julia Roberts from the movie."
"For most of us, there is no Richard Gere."
It's a fantasy.
"Libena and the boy seemed to be in love, and he offered to pay off her debt, so I gave them their chance at the fairy tale."
And then what?
"You figured if Tendu was able to identify you and the agency's owners, other people could, too?"
You burned down your office to cover your tracks?
"$100,000 is more than enough to replace some old computers and open a new office."
GREGSON:
Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?
He didn't say he would do it.
He did it.
Paid me on the spot.
In cash?
Brand new hundred dollar bills.
Joey Ng told us he hadn't given Tendu any money.
Did he say where he got it?
"Mm, sorry."
"When someone hands me money, I don't ask where it came from."
"- Yeah, shoot."
- Do penises age?
"Ugh, if I had a nickel."
The short answer is yes.
"The long answer, much more complicated, you know, based on penis size or shape or whether there's been a traumatic event"
- or even just natural slope.
- A slope?
"Yeah, sometimes a penis can take a slope to the right or to the left."
"If you're lucky, it goes up."
"- Oh, okay."
- Why are we talking about this?
I think tonight Mark and I are gonna do it for the first time.
- What?
"- Yes, I mean, since we got back together."
What about all that hot and heavy stuff on the porch?
I thought you guys would've been all over each other.
- It's been a couple weeks.
"- No, no, no, no."
"He said, and I quote, ""I wanna do this, but I wanna take it slow."""
"- So, since then, there's just..."
- Right.
Been a lot of dry humping and starting meaningfully into each other's eyes.
"Sign me up for a good dry hump, right?"
Although there is a lot of chafing involved.
"But it's been 15 years since I've seen, you know, it, and I just don't know if it's gonna be, like,"
"""Oh, hello, old friend,"" or ""Oh, God, what happened to you?"""
"Well, I would be more worried about him seeing my body, you know, 15 years later."
"'Cause this is 40, right?"
Things are very different.
"God, I hadn't even thought about that."
- Oh.
"- Okay, if you saw... if you saw this coming towards you, what would you think about that?"
-No.
In the end you're living at Pablo's home.
-In my house.
I don't care who's the owner.
"If you'd analyze your behavior with me or Pablo, you'd realize the deep reason..."
-Don't start with your theories!
You live completely apart from them.
You've made up a character and your buying it.
How is that character to you?
-A victim of the society.
"An idealist, full of altruism."
"And actually you're selfish, dominant, maniac..."
And sometimes miserable like everyone else!
I think you haven't missed anything.
Of course I have!
Or do you think it's easy to put up with someone teaching everyone?
Is it better for you to act irrationally?
A bit of that irrationalism could be good for you.
I don't want to keep arguing about this!
It'll be better if we don't see each other for a couple of days.
I've been wanting to tell you that for a while.
It'll be better if we don't meet ever again.
I see you've thought about it.
Yes.
Then I agree.
I'm sorry to tell you this while arguing.
It's absurd to argue at this point.
There's something true in what you say.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
It's something I'm always thinking.
Why did you came here the first night?
"Mostly, I was thinking about racquetball later and hopefully giving Cam a nice spanking."
Fair warning... may be working out some anger issues on the racquetball court this morning.
- Don't ask.
- Sounds good.
"So, we're getting our new dryer delivered."
"It's supposed to be eggshell, but, oh, it's not eggshell..."
It's white.
"Anyway, I'm laying into the delivery driver, and Mitchell strolls in and says, ""oh, it's fine,"""
and then offers him a piece of his banana loaf.
I heard that.
"Uh, just once, I would like Mitchell to take my side."
I'm constantly strolling in and saving him like a little princess in the tower.
Sometimes I'd like to be the princess.
"- Six of one, right?"
- What?
Why are...
Why are we stopping?
I'm...
"I'm very confused, Phillip."
"Trust me, this house is gonna sell at Thorpe speed."
"Hey, guys."
"Oh, hey, Phil."
I guess you heard.
I'm sorry.
"Oh, no, it happens all the time."
I just stopped by to give you guys a little care package to show you there's no hard feelings.
"Class act, dung beetle."
Here's the malpractice attorney most of his clients have used after he's ripped them off.
"You will be losing some sleep, but these have always helped my wife."
"And this priest is retired, but I think he still does exorcisms, which you'll need after today."
"- Listen, Phil..."
- It's okay.
"Let's just say I'd prefer to gloss over this period of my life with a simple paragraph that reads,"
"""For a while he was employed in a minor executive capacity"
"""in a commercial...enterprise..."""
"What happens if they're bigger than me, like him?"
You're not going to wrestle with him!
All you're gonna do is use a bit of psychology.
-
- Show me.
-
"- Granville, it's simple enough."
I'll show you this last once and then it's y--your turn.
I'd like to try on something a bit smaller.
Don't be silly.
"The bigger they are, the harder they spend."
Pay attention.
Make sure he is going to pass the shop.
"If he's coming in anyway, you're wasting your time."
"No, it's too late once they've passed the shop."
He'll be away.
It's never too late.
You catch him at the warehouse door as they pass the back.
"You go out there, and if he goes round the corner, stamp your foot."
-
- Stamp me foot?
-
- You know what stamping your foot is.
Like that!
Missed him.
Obviously missed him.
The one thing I hate is grit in the eye.
The tiniest speck feels like a d--dormer bungalow!
You want to wet the corner of your handkerchief.
"But I have to, I am under contract."
Did you tell Simon ?
"When I leave for so long, I'm scared scared, that something might happen to him while I'm gone."
Thank goodness he's stronger than he looks.
"You know, a little while after I met you,"
Simon told me :
"Mom, I'm glad you met François that you know about the two of us because I couldn't bear that if something happened to me, nobody explained it to him."
Always worrying about the others.
It is true that it was not the life I wished for him but I am glad you're here.
"Come on, eat before it gets cold."
I can't imagine the way I looked when you told me that you were a sailor.
"Me the literature student having an affair with a sailor,"
I thought it was a bit of a cliché.
You mean you were scared that I was an stupid.
You can say it..
I've always seen right through you.
You've always been like an open book to me.
However the way you hid the truth about your condition
Bingo !
It could have won you an oscar.
I didn't want to lie to you.
I just wanted us to be happy.
Come on !
I'm coming !
"Good morning madam, this is doctor Seguin from the cardiology department of Brest hospital."
Yes !
We have just found a perfect donnor for Simon's heart transplant.
Yes !
I'll get him ready.
Thank you.
"And then, little by little I came back to life."
At the beginning everything seemed to be normal.
She isnt iII-mannered.
Shejust told you what the truth was.
That poor girl didnt know that you people would get..
..so irritated after knowing the truth!
"ItII be better if you talk clearly, instead of confusing us."
"If you hate us so much, then why have you kept.."
..relations with us from so many years!
?
"Because he promised your mother, when she was.."
"..about to die, that he will never let her children cry but."
.. but he didnt know that one day..
..those children will make him weep!
He did so much for you!
You forgot all that so soon!
"You are forgetting, sister-in-Iaw."
"He got those 13 thousand rupees, which he invested.."
"..in business and succeeded, after selling.."
"..that hut, and that hut didnt belong to him.."
..but to our mother.
"Whatever he did for us was not a favor, but it was his duty."
"Dont feel bad, sister-in-Iaw."
"Anyway, whateverthey are.."
"..doing, they are doing it for you both, forthis family."
You indeed eat food twice a day..
..but have you everthought who pays forthat?
"We are doing how much we can, sister-in-Iaw.."
..but brother shouldnt snatch our peace from us.
I dont want to snatch anything from you..
..but I amjust snatching a right from you today.
Janki.
No one will conduct my final riots from among these two.
"Anyway brother, this right is not meant for us.."
- Do you think so?
Willoughby...
"You see, I speak his name calmly."
Then there is something I must tell you.
- He came when you were very ill.
- To Cleveland?
He came from London like a madman.
"I promised him that when you were well, I would pass his words on to you."
"Each day since, I have feared to unsettle your mind too soon."
I can talk of it now.
"You were playing lovely, Miss Marianne."
Is it all right for me to polish the table?
Of course you may.
"Marianne, let us put on our coats and go for a walk."
He did love you.
"He implored me to tell you that he was penitent, that you would always be dear to him,"
and he begged you to forgive him.
Did you forgive him?
"For my part, yes."
"And I pitied him, but did not tell him so."
My illness has made me think.
I had enough leisure to reflect.
Only now do I see that my own want of feelings brought on my sufferings.
I always talked about feelings but they were all for myself.
I wronged you and I wronged Mother.
My weak character almost brought me to the grave.
- My love...
"- I brought my illness on myself, by play-acting, pining and starving myself romantically, and being foolish till I almost died of it."
And I knew I was doing wrong.
"As for Willoughby, I don't know if I can soon or ever forget him."
My own future conduct must be my proof.
"Yes, because I hope to earn forgiveness."
"Brothers, what's your opinion?"
We'll obey our chief!
"Fung-wu, why did you kill your master?"
I'm innocent!
"Those that have broken our regulations must be locked in the closet, no matter how senior he is."
But my master...
"Before I leave here, I hope you learn patience."
I knew your master well.
He was a friend.
"Fung-wu, I promise you I'll see what I can do."
Thanks!
His Highness has initiated a competition between Shaolin and Wu-tang to elect the ruler of the martial arts world.
Which chamber should be our representative?
"I think among the various chambers, the Four Escorts are our best fighters."
I think the Pine Crane Chamber is enough.
Yes... enough!
"You're a senior, and your kung-fu is acknowledged to be the best."
Your 8-divine sword is superb now.
You'll surely win!
"Yes, we'll win!"
Yes... we'll win!
This contest is to see who will be supreme chief.
It decides the destiny of Wu-tang.
We can't underestimate Shaolin.
What you mean is?
Monk Wo-tao will be out tomorrow.
I think we better let him decide.
Shaolin Chin Kang Fist requires great speed.
It attacks the enemy at all his vital points.
8-divine Sword may not be able to counter it.
And your opinion is?
"Unless we can understand the Chin Kang Fist, we'll lose and bring disgrace to Wu-tang."
My teeth are still rattling from that.
Twenty seven is a lot of very fast rocks.
Scale nine puts the storm over a vast area too.
How much would it add to our flight time if we went around it?
Estimated flight time of 84 hours would increase to 336 hours.
- Four times as long.
- Confirmed.
Would the force wall hold if we went straight through the storm?
"It is within the maximum design tolerance, however there would be no safety margin."
Is there enough reserve power to maintain the wall?
Insufficient data for accurate projection.
"- In other words, he doesn't know."
- Confirmed.
Let's go round.
Are the others still searching?
"Yes, nothing so far."
Do you want any help on the flight deck?
"No, we've almost finished."
"Sonheim, there was something I wanted to ask you."
"Go ahead, I'll catch you up."
What is it?
Finding Dortmunn's body put it out of my mind.
Why did you follow me to the storage hold?
Why do you think?
You're an attractive girl.
"You asked where the hold was, I snapped at you."
I came after you to apologise.
To apologise?
Of course.
What other reason could I have?
Perhaps you were afraid I would find Dortmunn.
That's ridiculous!
"Tell me, what's going on?"
Somebody left a dead body on my doorstep.
There's another vampire in this city.
And it's just getting started.
You moved the body.
Are you out of your mind?
Under the circumstances it made the most sense.
"No, you totally compromised the evidence."
I preserved the body to the best of my ability.
"No, you should have called the police, that's what you should have done."
And that's why I came to you.
You know my life doesn't bear scrutiny.
Isn't your job to serve and protect?
"Actually, I don't think that motto was meant to extend to the undead."
"There's another vampire out there, and this one is killing people."
Detective...
"I need your help, unless you'd rather me handle this on my own."
Okay.
"Fine, what's done is done."
"Let's just move on, shall we?"
What happened?
This is what I know.
The body appeared at my door around 9:00 p.m.
She was already dead.
The neck had been savaged and she was drained of all her blood.
So...what?
This is the vampire equivalent of a gift basket?
It wasn't a present.
Vampires are solitary predators.
It's in our nature.
It keeps us from over populating and depleting our hunting grounds.
He wants my territory.
- Girl's been through enough.
- Fantastic.
"Hey, look on the bright side."
"Dyson found Olivia, and everything will be just fine."
Shit-encrusted maggots.
"Burning, scorching rain."
Flaying skin of rotting sinners.
"- Yeah, we're working on that."
- Don't touch me!
- How is she?
- I'm easing her pain but her brain is in a death spiral.
The prodigal Succubus.
What's your part in this?
She asked me to execute a human and I refused.
"We fought, and her attack, I guess it backfired."
And then someone killed Samir.
I went over to talk to him and he was already dead.
All I saw was Olivia like this.
She ran as soon as she saw me.
Her insanity does explain the messy kill.
I didn't kill my husband.
"I ate his brains with a tarragon sauce, but he did not die!"
That cheating sack of shit taunts me from the other world!
"Attacking a human out of jealousy, murdering your mate?"
Supposed to punish those who break our rules not break them yourself.
"And you, siding with a human over a Fae."
You could not take a more foolish position.
The day is still early.
I'll break the news to Olivia's sisters.
We'll be keeping you under close scrutiny.
"And you, Dyson, let's hope your performance improves."
I'm so sorry.
Will you join forces with me?
Then there will be nothing we can't achieve.
Do not beg for your life so pathetically with your vile tongue.
"Countless people, including myself, have suffered a life more miserable than death because of you."
"Even if I forget those days,"
I could never be rid of this grudge inside me.
Now...
I will put an end to your shameful life.
Kill me.
Boss.
"In your next life, please live your life for those poor souls whose lives you have taken."
"I have finally gotten the revenge I've dreamed of, but I don't understand why I feel so heavy-hearted."
Don't be confused.
"Yi Do-hyung's life was marred by many people's grudges, but you could live a life to benefit those who suffer."
And I believe you can do just that.
"Shouldn't we cut off Yi Do-hyung's head, and display it at the marketplace?"
That will appease the grudges of some of the people.
Leave his body here for Yum Moon to see.
"We will have the upper hand in a battle with Yum Moon, if he goes berserk after seeing Master Yi's corpse."
We will return to Chunghae and regroup for now.
All right.
We have secured enough food and weapons.
We must pull out before the reinforcements get here.
All right.
Head Chief.
It seems that Joong-dal and Chun-tae have run away.
I will send men after them.
We will pull out without them.
Master...
Master.
Master.
Master!
Because it's a murder weapon.
They'll convict her based on her trying to hide it.
"So let's find it before they do, turn it over to the cops"
And show the jury she has nothing to hide.
"Just do it fast, before the next news cycle."
"Luther,you're an ex-D.A."
How long do we have before they identify ann?
Depends.
"Police have a composite drawing,"
Which means they can't put a name to a face yet.
By now they have picked over the scene
"And found her fingerprints,"
And they're entering them into their master database.
"If she had a record, they'd know who she is now."
"The good news is,she doesn't."
"The bad news is, with her driver's license,"
"Passport and her student loan application,"
They'll know who she is by morning.
Fine.
We can do a lot in one night.
"Yeah,like make our case worse."
Nothing says we have to find the knife.
What if we decide not to go with self-Defense after all?
Stein's wife was in paris.
"We can't blame her,"
"And this doesn't look like suicide,"
So it's self-Defense or nothing.
"Find the knife,now."
Think.
"When you left the hotel, did you go left or right?"
"Uh,i don't remember where i threw it."
I--It was an alley.
- Wholesale.
No girl ever had two better friends than you and Allison.
"When you see how hard Mother makes you work, you won't say that."
- Rodney's outside.
"- Good, let him wait."
You'll be arrested for wearing that.
"No, just picked up."
Mother says women should be mysterious.
- Do you think the dress is too old?
"- No, you're too young."
Won't people think you're a little fast?
"According to my philosophy, what other people think will not pay the rent."
"If you're accused of being fast, might as well run."
Get the good things first.
"Just remember, men can see much better than they can think."
"Believe me, a low-cut neckline does more for a girl's future than the entire Britannica encyclopedia."
"- Allison, could you help me a moment?"
- Sure.
- Be right back.
- Do you think Rod will like it?
When you have your 18th birthday party I don't want you to invite Betty Anderson.
I might as well not have a party.
"If I can't invite Betty, Rodney won't come."
I wouldn't mind that.
"If Rodney won't come, his friends won't."
Then nobody will accept.
I can't understand why you want to be friends with Betty.
I don't like the way she talks about men and sex.
It appears the only perfect individual is you.
We've had 17 dull birthday parties alone.
"Could you let me have one for myself, please?"
"Allison, what about Betty?"
"You're an offender, which means there's no chance you'll be able to rejoin the police."
- Yet I'm not a criminal.
- Let's look on the bright side.
Try getting you into work.
Everything follows from that.
OK.
"Well, erm,"
"I was a detective inspector, so I've got a valuable skill set."
"So, any news on them forensics?"
"Erm, yes, sir."
There were notable findings on the inside of the envelope recovered from Danny Waldron's flat.
They found a number of tiny stains less than a millimetre across.
"Ink, standard biro -- could have belonged to anyone."
And blood.
"And that'd be Danny's, right?"
"No, sir, it matched Linus Murphy's."
The final report states that these findings are consistent with a blood-stained note written during or shortly after
Danny Waldron's torture murder of Linus Murphy.
"- Should I send a copy to DS Arnott, sir?"
- No.
"No, I'll handle it for now, and... .. and this is just between us for now?"
Nice one.
Who is it?
Robin from the offender management team.
Come in.
Were you issued with the information leaflet?
Good.
This is difficult for you... .. and we're here to help you pick up the pieces.
How long do I have to stay here?
You served half your sentence and now you're out on licence.
"You understand all this, of course."
We want to help you move on but it's not going to be easy.
That's dividends for the josie mansfield corporation.
If i had a thousand lives to live in revelry i'd live them
aah!
Once there was a man taught me how to love
parted
"that's jim fisk, everybody!"
He's the biggest thief in new york!
He robbed the erie to put on this show!
He built this place with our money!
"You bought this opera house with our money, fisk!"
We'll show you up!
You return that money!
Who pays for josie mansfield's diamonds?
The stockholders!
"How did you get the money for this show, jim fisk?"
Jim's just a thief!
You robbed the stockholders!
"Whenever you get your head above the clouds, somebody's jealous, somebody wants to throw stones."
Laugh at 'em like i do.
The trouble is we're not holding our heads high enough.
They can still reach us.
Do you suppose they would have dared make fun of old vanderbilt like they did you and me?
Not by a jugful!
We're going to climb higher- all of us!
We're going to climb so high that they'll have to break their necks looking at us!
There's only one way to do it-money.
I'm going to build a throne of gold and put you on it.
"Jim, what are you talking about?"
Gold!
I wear a couple of tinhorn sports chasing paper money.
Greenbacks are nothing but notes that uncle sam writes on to tell us he's got the gold.
I want what they stand for-all of it!
You did not just tell me another secret.
You're a home-wrecker too.
- Jiminy Crispy.
"- Oh, don't ""Jiminy Crispy"" me."
Chuck thinks her mother died during childbirth.
"I mean, according to Vivian, Chuck..."
Charlotte thought her mother died during childbirth.
"Well, it doesn't matter what Charlotte thought."
She's dead now.
"Oh, look at you, all pious."
You'd think you'd fit right in at a nunnery.
"- Hell, might even do you some good."
- Who are you?
The good-for-me police?
"Oh, come on."
That epic tanty you pitched back at The Pie Hole?
That wasn't all my doing.
I realize I have some man issues to sort out.
So sort them out.
"Sort them out here, where men won't be an issue."
"Stay as long as you like, until your head is clear."
"But Olive feared Lily's idea of ""as long as you like""  was considerably longer than hers."
"Thirty-nine miles away, north by northeast  the private detective, the Pie-Maker and Chuck climbed a windy road  to the childhood home of Betty Bee."
A home that was supposed to be vacant.
But the home was not vacant at all.
That colony collapse was a hoax.
Her bees didn't die.
She stole them.
Damn.
"You know, suddenly a crazy cat lady don't seem so crazy no more."
"So Kentucky helped Betty steal Betty's bees, they fake a colony collapse."
"Get away with conspiracy, sabotage and grand theft."
"- What you think we are, stupid?"
- Off course I think you're stupid.
That's the point.
You're gonna have enough trouble keepin' up with what I'm gonna tell you as it is.
"If you tuck it out too, we'll be wastin' everybody's time."
"You don't want mama's good wisdom goin' to waste, do you?"
"Heck, I'll be surprised if your arms are burnin' already, for keeping us at gun's points for a while."
"I mean, it's not like we're packed or anything, what do you afraid of?"
That better?
"- Alright, where was I?"
- You're gonna ask us something.
"Oh that's right, Thanks!"
Okay.
So... here it goes.
"My partner weighs in at about 95 pounds, right?"
"And together you guys are pushing half a ton, give or take, right?"
"So, did you need much help stuffing' her in that garbage can?"
Now...
"I usually don't talk to people like you in the first place, but... if I did that sort of things,"
I would say that you girls should have your own TV show.
"And that you should call that program ""The Adventure of Donnie's Bitches""."
"But like I said at the top,"
I usually don't talk to people like you.
Because talking' to people like you doesn't make much sense.
"What do you mean, ""People like us""?"
What the hell kind of people are we?
Dead ones.
What?
"Found some bullets, but now I might be out again."
How about you partner?
I think I'm hearin' somethin'.
Something like what?
"Now welcome your host, Jimmy Carr!"
"Hello, and welcome to 8 Out of 10 Cats, a show about opinion polls, surveys, and statistics."
"Did you know, for example, 50% of people say they feel they're not living life to the full."
"Come on, how can you say that?"
"You're sitting on your own, watching E4, in your pants, eating a yoghurt."
It's pretty full-on.
Tinder has 10 million active daily users.
"Oh, yeah, it's got users all right."
"You could've called me, Carlos."
You could've called.
And 64% of teenagers think they have it harder than their parents.
"Well, I'd like to say to those teenagers, they're wrong."
No-one has ever had it harder than your mum.
"Right, let's get started!"
What Are You Talking About?
That's the name of our first round.
It's our panellists' job to guess the nation's top three most popular Brits.
"Aisling's team, who do you think are the most popular people in Britain?"
"Uh, JK Rowling."
"She's become incredibly successful, a global phenomenon."
Yeah.
Do you love her?
"Oh, I love her, I've read, have you read all the Harry Potter books?"
"No, I'm 32."
"But... ..I've read a lot of her work, on Twitter, which I think is genius."
Because she is...
"Sorry, sorry, actually..."
"Yeah, no, no, the books are stupid, they're childish, it's silly."
"I mean, she is a woman who basically has become a billionaire by taking children's pocket money."
She's a genius in my book.
"Did you see recently, speaking of Twitter, she's had this big Twitter spat with Joanna Trollope?"
It's actually really hard when someone's called a Trollope already to work out what to call them.
I don't know the answer.
We're a family through choice.
"I mean, if we care about each other, it's because we decide to, not because we happen to be related through some fluke of a father that happened to have these children."
Yeah.
"What were you thinking, Lou?"
I've been to most of your buildings now.
India and Bangladesh will be the last.
I like your Exeter Library.
It looks a lot like the factory buildings you walked by as a little boy back in Philadelphia.
But nobody expects what you did inside.
I always believed that in the end you'd chosen my mother and me.
That was the myth I lived on.
"But you didn't really choose any of us, did you?"
Did you think that Lou would marry you?
"Yes, and I didn't expect to get pregnant, and I was really surprised when I told Lou, and then his comment was, you know, ""Not again."""
So I certainly thought when I told him that he would... that he would in some way do something to help me.
"""Not again"" meaning what?"
"Well, that this had happened to him before with Alex."
- You know.
- With Anne?
"Yeah, with Anne."
"Well, didn't you know what you were getting into?"
"Oh, come on, Nathaniel."
"Well, I just..."
"I mean, you know."
You always protect him.
"That's hard, you know?"
"I mean, he was..."
- I did trust him.
I was pretty stupid.
"- You know mom, what he did to you and I"
"- was... was pretty bad, really."
- Hang on a minute.
The president asked me to join his Cabinet.
He asked me to stall my career with the agreement that he'd help me...
You don't want it.
You're helping yourself.
"If this announcement makes A17 of the Metro section, I'd be surprised."
There's one name on the ballot this November.
"Not yours, not mine, not the governor of New Jersey."
No one will work harder than Jed Bartlet to put you there.
"This president loses reelection, your career is finished, and so is mine."
What's your point?
Next time you announce new policy that isn't cleared we're announcing you're moving back to New Jersey.
- What about the loans?
- C.J. will announce them tomorrow.
Come on.
Let me do it with the president.
It's too small for the president.
I've gotta go back to a meeting.
- Yep.
It was the rebate.
- It wasn't a rebate.
It was an advance.
- You say potato... .
"- I do say potato, so does everybody."
We wanted to inject money into retail and tourism.
Why not wait until people were supposed to have the money?
The economy might have improved on its own by then.
"In which case, it would have been pointless."
- Yeah.
- Economists make it up as they go along.
- Yeah.
- Did it work?

Where can we find a lot of humans?
It doesn't look tasty.
THE FOX FAMILY
"Today at 7 PM, not far from the scene where a woman was axed..."
- Sir!
"- You did it, before."
"Nobody can come here, and don't touch anything."
"Since we came down too soon without adapting to humans, there was a slight mistake earlier."
"In one month, it will finally be the 1000th year."
"A month will be enough, right?"
We came down too early.
"Yeah, we've already prepared for 1000 years."
"When the sun and the moon meet, and the four pillars of the year, month, day, and time join together... 30 minutes."
"When the sun and the moon align as one for those 30 minutes, our fate will be decided."
Our chance only comes...
Only once.
If you fail...
There will never be another chance.
Never forget that!
"Planned to say that, right?"
But you said a bunch of humans will come if we perform a circus.
"Yeah, and only kids came."
Disappointed that you can't mate?
What's the use if only kids come?
They all run away.
"To catch and eat humans, we need to be more active and bold."
Isn't that the way to look for humans?
You're too passive.
You son of bitch!
"Darling, ever since you passed away,"
I've tried hard to make real people out of our kids.
"Absolutely secure, h."
The system guarantees it.
"Horatio, I'm sure I don't have to tell you,"
But I never touched that cuff link.
I saw it and I popped off two-by-fives.
"Okay, I understand that, jesse."
"Now, can we run the cuff link through the database, gentlemen?"
"Our cuff link has a unique appearance,"
So we should be able to run it
Through image recognition software.
I did a similar search
"Two and a half years ago, nothing came up."
"No, no, no."
"This is different, this is new."
It's like facial recognition software.
"Compares shapes and features, then searches for"
Any comparable image anywhere on the web.
"Okay, did we get a match?"
We have a match.
Westside platinum jewelers.
I heard of that place.
They must have taken their store online.
"Okay, eric and I are gonna check into that."
"Thank you, gentlemen."
What can I do?
"Jesse, just lay low."
H.
Westside platinum.
I got a batch of orders for the cuff links.
"All right, I'm gonna print out the company list,"
We'll go name by name.
Wait a second.
When you saw us duck down the alley you knew we was headed to the hideout.
- I took the old shortcut.
- What do they call you?
- Soapy's the name.
He's Bim.
This mug here's Swing.
This palooka up here's Hunky.
"- Hi, Rocky."
What's left of her remains have been in here over a week.
You might wanna use the vapo rub.
Let's hope the rest of her is in there.
Resting in pieces.
Someone at the Brooklyn M.E.'s office sandbagged us.
"Yeah, I'll bet his name is Mark Mogan."
"Look, man, I just process them and ship them."
Does that process include leaving your semen in Manette Combs' severed throat?
"- No, that's insane."
- So is raping the dead.
"You know abusing a corpse is a crime, Mark?"
I never abused anybody.
Three dozen unclaimed bodies you processed and shipped are being exhumed right now.
- Why?
- To see what's in the caskets.
What's it gonna be?
Some more violated corpses or just more beanie bodies.
"Listen, it's not what you're thinking."
"Oh, you have no idea what I'm thinking."
I was performing a public service.
"Yeah, even the dead need a little loving."
I only took junkies and bums.
"They didn't contribute anything to the world while they were living, so I helped them contribute a little after they died."
- By chopping them up?
What'd you pick him up for?
Because he was a potential suspect the Vincent Nelson homicide and we wanted to ask him questions about his relationship with Mr. Nelson.
And what was the subject's physical condition when you first saw him?
Nothing unusual.
Maybe he was a little nervous.
Cops make some people nervous.
- But basically he was fine?
- Yes.
"- No cuts, no bruises,o scrapes?"
- No.
What about the abrasion on the side of his head?
He walk in with that?
"During the interview, he grew agitated."
Started flailing around.
I had to restrain him.
"When I let go, he slipped and fell off the chair."
17-year-old boys don't just slip and fall and then drop dead.
And they also don't require a guardian to be present during questioning.
So maybe you gave him a little push.
You know what?
I changed my mind.
"If you want my statement, G.O.15 me."
I want my union attorney.
2 days ago
Flying tomato over here took a dip in the garbage while he was snowboarding.
Landed right next to the foot.
The rest of the body?
We're canvassg garbage receptacles in the area.
The city only picks up trash once a week on account of the budget cuts.
This place is turning into a cesspool.
Look what I found.
It's got dried blood all over it.
One day you may understand.
- What have you done ?
"- A royal wedding gift, from the heart."
To the ships !
To the ships !
Storm !
"My dearest Topanga, it's day 58 of my summer road trip across this great country of ours with my dear brother, Eric."
"This may be the last entry in my travel log, as my road buddy is becoming ornery."
"Hi, Topanga."
I don't know why Cory thinks I'm ornery.
"I'm actually, you know, pretty happy now that I've got the tape recorder and I don't have to listen to Cory yammer on for two months and 48 states about life on the road."
"And speaking of the road, here it is now."
Tape recorder number 17.
The golden rays of the sunset remind me of the golden highlights in your beautiful hair.
You're insane!
"I mean, how is it that everything you see in this country reminds you of Topanga?"
"Oh, you exaggerate, Eric."
"I mean, I did not mention her once during our tour of the White House."
"Hmm. ""Topanga's got a desk just like Chelsea's."""
"Well, I didn't say anything at the Kennedy Space Center."
"""Topanga's favorite movie is Apollo 13."""
"Mount Rushmore? ""Will you look at the lips on Teddy Roosevelt?"""
I said that out loud?
"You've Topanga-ed me to death, man!"
"Well, I, for one, Eric, had a delightful summer, and there's a part of me that's sorry to see this trip end."
"Well, this trip is far from ended."
Why are you stalling?
I'm not stalling.
I just want to make sure I don't miss anything in these here United States.
"Eric, we're three hours from home, you know?"
We said we'd be home tonight.
I never met a mother who thought their child was guilty.
But do you think she could have taken her frustration out on you?
It's possible.
"Henry, while there is still time,"
I will do all that I can to find out who did this.
I give you my word.
Father.
George.
Please don't tell me he's dead.
The Lord in his infinite compassion has given Henry more time to say his goodbyes.
I've been praying for some kind of miracle.
"You get on well with Henry, don't you?"
"When we met in the Red Lion a year ago, I was a typical ex-copper."
"Drunk, broken marriage, fast heading for a hole in the ground."
"Henry had just given up the hanging job, so he wasn't feeling too great himself."
But he insisted he wanted to help me.
He put a spade in my hand and introduced me to the joys of nature.
"The Good Samaritan, eh?"
George.
Sorry about this but I'm going to have to bring you in.
Why?
My colleagues found hemlock in your house.
George is no murderer.
"Well, it's not looking good for him."
"No, it isn't."
"What do you think, Father?"
Hemlock.
Strange choice of poison.
"It paralyses the body slowly but leaves the mind untouched, which means it increases the chance the culprit will be identified."
George would have known that there are much more clinical toxins.
But if he was the only person to touch the teacup...
"Well, actually we're not sure that he was."
"- Hey muscled men, bring me some roasted peanuts."
- Sorry that is not our job
"Then what else is your job, you pig-headed wastrels?"
"- If you stand folding hands, does that make you Arnold?"
- Please hold your tongue.
- What is the use of drinking half a bottle of beer if you can't squabble?
I know monkey kung fu.
- Please sit down.
- Will you bring or not?
- Sit I say
- I sit only to honor your request.
"Sir, your bill."
"Sir, kindly take."
Well how much have they charged?
How could you charge 5000?
"- Sorry sir, this bill belongs to the next table."
"- You saved my life, man"
"- How could you charge 10,000?"
"- Yes sir, this is your bill."
If I had known earlier I would have sat at the nearby table?
Is this a bar or some place of extortion?
"How can you charge 10,000 for a single bottle of beer?"
- Don't you have money?
"- All I have is 10,000"
"And by the way,"
After knowing all this my mother won't relent to our marriage.
Have you to spend your life with me or with my brothers?
"Although the marriage is with you,"
The relation will be with all.
Isn't it?
"Sheen, I am willing to break away every relationship for your sake."
"Faiz, you cannot do this even if you wish to."
He is a genius when it comes to information technology.
And he has a doctorate in network engineering.
This young man here is blessed with a tall physique.
He is our compatriot from Texas who made Korea proud.
I present you Dr. Lee Yun Seong.
"Pleased to meet you all, may you all guide me well."
Dr. Lee Yun Seong?
Yes?
I will depend on you from now on.
Yes.
I understand.
"Everybody, go back to your respective work, quick, quick!"
"Dr. Lee, your desk is right here."
I'm Go Gi Jun.
"Yes, nice to meet you."
I've been working in this department for 2 years.
"If you just do as I say, then it won't be difficult."
Take good care of it.
Don't mistake these with the midnight snack coupons that you can get by the fountain near the main entrance.
Why?
"Well, because the canteen is generally closed around that time."
I think you can have it back.
Not working overtime is one of my working conditions.
How is it possible that you're the only one who doesn't have to work overtime?
Are you trying to pass your dinner task to him?
"Stop dreaming, Go Gi Jun."
"You're already an expert in this, so continue doing it in the future."
He dares to ask someone from MIT to do this.
"Yes, I will continue to do it in the future."
What?
Aren't we going to camping training?
"It has been cancelled, right?"
"Sorry, man."
I'm just being honest.
Dean:
"So, you were scheduled to close the gym last night?"
"Yeah, but I didn't exactly lock up."
"Carol was still working out, and [sighs] I had a date."
"I didn't want to shortchange her, you know?"
"I mean, the poor girl has been working so hard to lose weight for her wedding."
"I slipped her the key, and I told her to lock up on her way out."
[ Gasps ]
"Oh, it's all my fault."
"[ Exhales sharply, sniffles ]"
Hey.
Find anything at the morgue?
Yeah.
"Uh, so, Wayne was banged up pretty bad."
"But on the back of his neck, just below his hairline... suction mark -- identical to Carol's."
"Okay, so, they both had marks, just like the hot trainer at Rollz."
But she was skinny... and alive.
And just recently lost a ton of weight.
"When I asked her about the mark, she, uh -- she clammed up, got all embarrassed."
"So, uh, I did some checking."
"And it turns out that she took a couple of ""me"" days last month and, uh, went here."
Canyon Valley?
Hm.
Yeah.
[ Mid-tempo music plays ]
"[ Peruvian accent ] When you look in the mirror, do you recognize the fat person staring back at you?"
"Have you tried every fad diet, every fitness trend out there, but nothing seems to work?"
"Here at Canyon Valley, we guarantee weight loss with no surgery..."
No extreme dieting and no intensive workout regimen.
Guaranteed results in one week!
The commute?
"Over here, yeah."
I tell you while I'm schlepping all the way here every morning
I'm going to miss being able to roll out of bed and pad over in me slippers.
"You won't have to schlep all the way over here, Nick, you'll have your own shed."
You'll be able to play on your laptop in there.
"Len, what are you trying to say?"
"No, oh, no, it's been lovely having you, but I have my hypothetical round-the-world cycle to complete, you know, I need my space back."
"Yeah, yeah of course."
Anyway I've got to go into town now with the lady wife buy Mr. Nibbles a radiator bed.
See if we can get the bugger indoors.
I'll pick up some boxes for your ***
I am cycling around the world in my imagination.
"I keep track of my progress on these charts, and measure the distance I travelled on the bike's pedometer."
"You're an excellent business man, Nick."
I like you very much.
Good-bye old friend.
Hello?
Jenny?
Nick?
"Leonard, look."
"I don't like this, Len."
"Stay close, dear, stay close."
Anybody there?
Show yourselves now!
The buggers have been in the shed.
Nooooooo!
"It is literally, literally the worst thing that could happen."
The worst thing!
"Well, try and keep it in perspective, love."
I mean one of us could be hit by a...
It is worse than that!
don't you think?
But it wouldn't be enough to save this country.
we'll need some significant casualties so that the entire world can rally to our aid.
Juiz?
Tsuji.
Casualties are the missing piece of this puzzle.
we live in an era where you can sue for spilling coffee on yourself.
"So you get your ""sacrifice"" ticket punched and hop on that famous last train."
We can't have all those NEETs resting on their laurels go to waste.
Let's put 'em outta their misery.
Tsuji.
It sends a chill up my spine.
Hell yeah.
The PM's son returns wearing an Air King shirt.
Japan's headed straight towards militarism again and he'll have all of them seeing red.
Iinuma Akira will be shaming the Japanese and everyone else.
Tsuji.
I pray you continue to act as a cutting-edge savior.
But how will you get him to wear the shirt?
"I bet that's the ""golden ring"" you were talking about."
I went and looked it up after you said that.
Japanese merry-go-rounds never had them to begin with.
but anything built up to the late 80s would still have it.
the ride keeps going.
Makes sense.
I'd probably know that.
Whiff.
Over already?
I'll watch from the bench.
When did you-?
maybe I spent the whole time watching movies... not the movie theater.
stretching out to grab the golden ring.
The police said there was an accident.
Somebody tried to carjack them?
"Yeah, they're doing well."
"Come on, I'll take you to them."
Aren't you two supposed to keep 50 feet apart or something.
"Bite me, Frank."
"Ask me, you're better off."
I didn't.
Second EKG is unchanged and troponin is negative.
He's pain-free after nitro and metoprolol.
"So, he's okay?"
"Well, it doesn't look like a heart attack, but I think he has unstable angina."
"One of the arteries around your heart may be closing down, so you'll have to stay in the hospital for observation and some more tests."
For how long?
Could be just a day or two.
- You okay with that?
- Like I got a choice?
You hang in there.
I'll stop by later if I can.
"Um, excuse me."
Excuse me.
Hi.
"It might be better if you stayed, because the cardiologist is probably gonna have questions and instructions for you and your husband."
"Oh, I'm not Lee's wife."
I'm his therapist.
Are you a doctor?
I'm his... satisfaction facilitator.
What is that exactly?
I have a select group of clients like Lee who require... something they're not getting at home.
Something... sexual.
"See, I provide the one thing that's missing, which allows them to live happily ever after with their wives."
Really?
"May they know his mercy, his comfort and his peace."
"May we uphold them with our prayers, encourage them with our letters honor them with our love."
"And may our lives, not less than theirs be dedicated to that same Lord who alone can give to life a perfect freedom and a final peace."
Let us pray.
"Our Father, who art in heaven hallowed be thy name."
"Thy kingdom come thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."
"Gives us this day, our daily bread and forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever."
Amen.
Thank you.
Come again.
- Yes?
- I'd like to see Miss Cross.
Selena.
"Miss Cross, you have a father in the Navy."
Lucas Augustus Cross?
My stepfather.
Have you seen him lately?
Not for a year and a half.
What's wrong?
He went on leave and didn't come back.
He's listed as a deserter.
"Miss Cross, you're sure you haven't seen him?"
I didn't even know that he was in the Navy.
- He hasn't called or written you?
- No.
"He disappeared from town a year and a half ago, deserting his family."
Looks like he's running true to form.
"If you do hear from him, get in touch with the First District Shore Patrol."
I will.
"Selena, don't get upset."
It's not your fault they can't find him.
What is it?
You use the studio whenever you want as long as you show whatever you finish.
"And in return I might, might unclench long enough to not freak out when you show my art to the world."
"You know that looking at him all the time isn't exactly going to discourage him, right?"
What?
And it's a deal about the studio.
And the Ike thing is all sorted.
Is it?
Yeah.
"So, what are you two women of the art world plotting over here?"
"Well, let's just say we're forming a support group and women artists of Weld unite."
Sounds excellent.
"Speaking of support, I might go see how Arlo's doing."
"So, how's Shay going with your gallery?"
I think we going to be just fine.
Great.
"Here's to a summer of endless possibilities then, eh?"
I'll drink to that.
(MUSIC) ♪ Life is short
♪ And in no ways easy
♪ Silver lining can be hard to see
♪ Now I've found it

Come on George!
Time to bust out some of the moves.
I think Weld's seen enough of my moves.
"(LAUGHS) Oh, that's where I think you're wrong."
I read your editorial.
I left it out for you to read.
And I did.
And?
"I found the dolphin allegory somewhat surprising at first but ultimately quite moving, and entirely consistent with the theme of life going on even in the shadow of death."
I illustrated it with Tom's photo of the flowers by the roadside.
Stealing is a sin.
I don't want it!
"-Regan, honey, it's to help you."
-I don't want it!
"-Hold still, honey."
-I don't want it!
You fucking bastard!
"Remember also, O Lord, thy servant, Mary Karras who has gone before us with the sign of faith and sleeps the sleep of peace."
"Lord, I am not worthy to receive you."
But only say the word and I shall be healed.
May the body of Christ bring me to everlasting life.
"Well, it's a symptom of a type of disturbance in the chemical-electrical activity of the brain."
"In your daughter's case, the temporal lobe, up here in the lateral part of the brain."
-Mm-hm.
-It's rare...but it does cause bizarre hallucinations and usually just before a convulsion.
A convulsion?
The shaking of the bed.
That's doubtless due to muscular spasms.
"Oh, no, no, that was no spasm."
"Look, I got on the bed."
"The whole bed was thumping and rising off the floor and shaking, the whole thing, with me on it."
"Mrs. MacNeil, the problem with your daughter is not her bed."
It's her brain.
"So, um, ahem."
What causes this?
Lesion.
Lesion in the temporal lobe.
It's a kind of seizure disorder.
"Look, Doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change."
"-In the temporal lobe, it's very common."
-It is?
"It, uh, can last for days, even weeks."
You okay?
That's my husband-
- I called him.
"Just duck under the tape,rick."
Stop.
It's a ime scene.
Crime scene?
"Honey,you all right?"
- She's fine.
- I am not fE.
I had to cancel my 1:00 showing.
Think I found where he was buried.
"Checked for footprints,but it rained last night, so everything's pretty washed out."
You got access?
There's side access at street level.
"Chain link fence around the yard, but any one with gloves could have scaled it."
Wait for me!
The real estate agent solve the big mystery?
"No,but she owns the property with a contractor and every real estate agent in town had access."
I meant the mystery of how they expect to sell a house for 600 grand when it only has two and a half bathrooms.
"Well,you know what they say:"
"Location,location... location."
"So,judging from the marks around the edges, looks like the digger used a garden spade."
"The soil's not real packed,so it wou have been easy digging for a male or a female."
You see that?
- Black plastic bags.
- Garbage bags.
Body bag.
"Get it back to abby,and a soil sample."
I want ground-penetrating radar.
"Uh,boss,those techs are bookedeeks in advance."
I'm going to tell them it's an emergency and I will not budge until they show.
Because I managed To flip it over.
It's starting to look A little black.
So that's almost A little bit compelling.
"Yeah, if zeke can Get past this, like,"
Jumble of boulders down There...
"And there's got to Be something,"
Something heavy Underneath the boulder.
"Hey, zeke, you, You seeing anything down there?"
I kind of just think I'm Seeing more bedrock down here.
"And there isn't really a layer That has any gold on it,"
You know what I'm saying?
"Yeah, no, I get it."
I think we've done All we can do on this side.
"I mean, I'm just..."
I'm not Seeing any heavy minerals.
"Zeke finally found some Bedrock,"
"Which, you know, Could be a potential place."
"For gold to hang out,"
But the bedrock Is just completely clean.
Theres no minerals or anything On it and definitely no gold.
"I think on this side Of the island,"
"All we're gonna find Is rock, dude."
Just rock after rock.
Okay.
Roger.
Neither zeke nor I Have the financial means.
To just spend this season Looking for new ground.
"At some point, if we don't Find what we're looking for,"
We're gonna have to know When to throw in the towel.
"With pinpointed areas Coming up dry,"
The partnership is Running out of options.
And will need a new plan.
How dare you?
You... you're...
As soon as you learnt about Tisha... it was clear that Kabir needed to die immediately.
Before he could rewrite his will.
You thought that when the police arrived and found guests like us present... you would show them the video recording.
"Then who in their right minds, would ever suspect you?"
Wait a minute.
Are you implying that I killed Mr. Malhotra?
That morning...
"Good morning, Mr. Malhotra."
Good morning.
"You went to his room, just as you did everyday."
Here's your mail.
When you were sure that he wasn't paying attention to you... you carried out your plan.
Using his pistol... very smoothly... you shot him.
You shot him in cold blood.
This is absurd.
Perhaps you don't remember that when the bullet was fired...
I was with you.
No.
What?
!
You were with me... when we heard what we thought was a gunshot.
Was that a gunshot?
The plan was good.
All you needed were two things.
One... an alibi... who would vouch that you were with him when the gun was fired.
Are you always an early riser or is today an exception?
"And, two... a small fire cracker."
And since there was to be a fireworks display that night... it wasn't diffcult getting a fire cracker.
"You can't smoke in here, Mr. Menon."
It's a pity you won't be able to enjoy tonight's celebration.
You bought this many?
!
Don't be silly.
You're buying them.
Huh?
Why me?
"As an apology for the failure the other day, obviously."
Having us infiltrate a fortress for no reason.
Leaving behind a hero relic we found without even using it.
"You're buying dango for me every day from now on, okay?"
You left it right along with me!
What were we going to do?
You think using a hero relic that's been resting for centuries is that easy?
And how does that relate to buying dango?
"Yes, ma'am."
I'll buy them.
It would be my pleasure.
- Very good.
"- Thank you, come again!"
Why does this happen to me?
Damn it!
This is all Sion's fault!
He keeps pushing one pain in the ass after another on me!
"I'll bet he's having a nice meal in the castle right about now, or a lazy afternoon nap..."
"Your Majesty, how do you intend to take responsibility for this matter?"
Watch your tone when addressing His Majesty!
"No, I shall be heard."
You've been too soft.
You granted status in our lands to the neighboring Estabul lord and nobles.
You even guaranteed that the populace would keep their lifestyle.
- That sort of attitude ferments...
- Be silent!
Unlock the control conduit.
"Tuvok, Torres, please respond."
Keep an eye on the flow rate.
"Yes, sir."
Rate's holding steady.
The reaction rate is stabilized at 13 percent.
Up to 15...18.
It worked then.
We're all right?
Maybe.
"Once the rate is up to normal, we'll try getting the warp drive back on line."
Then we'll see if there was any damage.
Begin rerouting power back to all key systems.
What happened down there?
"I don't know, exactly."
"I went in the shop, completed the trade, then I heard weapons fire on the street."
"By the time I got out there, the Captain and the others were gone."
Are you sure it was the Mokra?
I spoke to witnesses on the street.
They said it was quite a fight.
Any idea how the Mokra knew you were down there?
Someone must have told them we were coming.
The Mokra have informants everywhere.
Could your contact be one of them?
I don't think I would have made it back here with the tellerium if he had been.
"Besides, he's involved with the Alsaurian resistance movement."
He would never help the Mokra.
They've probably got the resistance movement under surveillance.
Commander.
I think we're ready to give the engines a try.
I'm opening the plasma injectors.
Warp engines are back on line.
But they'll eat him alive.
"My brother is innocent Inspector, and so am I."
"All this, all this just shows how desperate you are."
You don't believe a jury will convict James either.
"If there's any more of this,"
I'll have to bring in my solicitor.
There will be more of this.
You know that.
(Phone ringing)
Alec Barr.
This is Father Sullivan.
The thing is I...
I need to speak to you before I go to the police.
What do you mean?
"What's all this about, Father?"
"I think you know that, Mr. Barr."
I know my family is under a great deal of pressure.
I'd have hoped even the modern church would give support and prayer.
Instead of which you phone me with some bizarre threat.
I'm not threatening you.
You said you had to talk to me before you talked to the police.
"I don't know what nonsense you've dreamed up, but a priest."
"Mr. Barr,"
I know it was you who came into my confessional the day before James's wife was killed.
I know it was your voice.
You said you were going to kill someone.
I'm quite prepared to testify to that if necessary.
But the best thing for you to do is to go to the police and tell them what happened.
What sort of priest are you?
And what sort of brother are you?
Anything I said is sacred.
"It's a sacrament, you bastard."
"It caught fire, and the flames seared his face and the backs of his hands."
"His father thought it would be better if he died, but his mother said he would grow up to be a great man because of it."
I first met your father... some AIA affairs.
And I sat right next to Lou.
"And I praised him, on the Richards Laboratory."
I thought that was really a marvelous group of buildings.
"And it was then that he told me, ""You know,"
"""go to Scotland."""
- Really?
- Know that?
No.
The Scottish castle gave him the inspiration.
- For Richards?
- Yes.
"And I said, ""That group of buildings are really one of your best."""
"And he said, ""Well, the best is yet to come."""
That was Salk.
So then he told me about his relationship with Salk.
"He said, ""I have the best client."""
"And he said, ""Well, I view somehow that this will be an important piece of work."""
And as it turned out to be.
I consider it to be a masterpiece of his.
The two of you have varying degrees of success with clients.
You seem to have succeeded very well.
I am...
"I am, but I'm a little bit more able to... a little more patient, perhaps, because of my being Chinese."
If my client...
"let's say a person did not agree with me,"
"I'll let it pass, and I'll come back another day."
I don't think Lou would do that.
Lou would probably...
push it right through.
A security guard maybe?
How long till I can come back here?
Could be a week.
Kelly had her bag stolen.
"If you have a list of contents maybe you know of, purse, credit cards, that sort of stuff?"
She had a debit card.
One for our joint savings account.
We were saving a house deposit.
Her mates gave her a gift card at her hen party.
That was probably in her purse.
Do you know what the gift card was?
"Ann Summers, 100 quid."
Something for our wedding night.
"No, it was a £100 gift card purchased last Monday."
From the Oxford Street branch.
The security guard at Tom Hartson's office reckoned the place was empty when he locked up at 8:30.
So Tommy wasn't there?
No.
When?
"All right, I need you to bell me as soon as that is used again."
Cheers.
"The gift card was used to purchase a red lace chemise size 10, whatever that is."
"A chemise is a short nightie, my son."
Is there something you want to tell me?
"Yeah, brush up on your French."
First Mrs Brooks wore a black lace chemise on our wedding night.
She was a knockout as well.
Our killer is on a promise?
Or Tommy boy is trying to throw us off the scent.
Make it look like a robbery.
No activity on Kelly's bank card since the day before yesterday.
But their joint savings account is another matter.
"- So, you didn't know her, Louise Hjelby?"
- Sony.
"On April 20th, two and a half years ago, you were in the vicinity of Gudbjerghavn, the town where Hjelby was killed."
Here's a copy of the hotel guest list.
"I was campaigning, it's my constituency, so, of course I was around there."
- You drove a black car.
- A BMW 3 series.
It was spotted on the road where Louise was taken.
"Same day, same time."
- I suppose I was at an election meeting.
- You suppose'?
The girl was abused and killed.
Peter Schultz wrote it off as a suicide.
"- So, be precise for your own sake."
- What did you speak to Schultz about?
And don't say you spoke of the good old days at law school.
Bloody hell!
We used this girl in one of our campaigns.
It was a campaign in aid of foster children.
- Who are you?
"- Per Monrad, political adviser."
"The girl's foster family was an example that our efforts out there bore fruit, so, it wasn't good news that she'd taken her own life."
An expensive campaign was binned before we even got started.
How was the public prosecutor involved?
What did you need him for?
It was Peter's case.
I just wanted to make sure that this wasn't relevant.
What did Peter say about the case?
It was confidential.
I respected that.
"- So, you actually did know the girl."
- That's not how it works.
"We find that road, we find him."
"And we don't stop, got it?"
So let's keep looking.
Let's find him.
MONTENEGRO:
"So, I used Booth's theory that whoever took Aldo based their route on avoiding surveillance."
Every turn they took was weighted towards avoiding cameras and crowds.
CAM:
That is elegant.
But what happens when there's more than one equal choice?
"Yeah, well... it gets less and less useful."
This is now out of control.
"Well, at least it gives us a general direction."
"Hey, I swabbed the perimortem striations on the ribs."
The rat bites?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
"So, rat teeth never stop growing."
Which means they're always having to gnaw on something just to keep them the right length.
Good to know.
What were they gnawing on?
I don't know.
"I found, uh, particulates of lead paint, so maybe they were gnawing on some cabinets, looking for food."
When was lead paint banned?
(beeping) 1978.
"So-so, we've got professional-grade acoustic foam and lead paint."
We need to be looking for a sound studio built before 1978.
Somewhere northwest of Bellevue.
"Right, but it would have to be near Rock Creek Park, because they had to get that body back there by morning."
(Cam sighs)
That's still a few square miles.
"Well, if it's a studio, it's likely to be abandoned."
"I'll butt him, but I won't reach."
"I was talking to an independent local dealer the other week about waiting lists, three-year-old Toyota Rav 4s."
How does that work?
"Whenever you went to your local dealer and had a good stock of three-year-old cars, he would've bought those from company fleets that sold them at auction."
"All of a sudden, they've changed tactics."
They're holding onto cars so they can save money on buying cars.
They're not selling cars off - they might keep them for five years.
Usual supply of three-year-old mainstream cars has dried up.
Top Gear top tip - don't buy something like that now.
"If anyone's got a three-year-old Toyota Rav 4 they want rid of,"
I know a bloke who'll have your arm off.
Time to sell it is now.
OK.
"Cars are facelifted throughout their lives, and when that happens the old version costs less."
It's often not very different.
It's tweaks.
Tweaks and things.
The VW Passat.
"Earlier this year, this car was facelifted."
The little rubber strips on the bumper were replaced with little chrome strips.
"As a result, cars with the rubber strips on the bumper are worth a bit less."
It's ridiculous.
How much?
VW Passat 1.
"8T, metallic paint,"
"list price £18,200."
"With rubber bits on the bumper, a bit over £15,500."
Hey?
!
Yeah.
You save how much?
I want to ask you this.
"Oh, my God."
What are you doing here?
My work.
SAROYAN:
W-We can handle this.
You should be home.
"Yeah, at the very least, you shouldn't be watching this."
"It must have been terrible, huh?"
It was unpleasant.
And losing the opportunity to examine vital evidence makes it more so.
Right.
"Well, I uploaded the photos that you sent."
My theory is that Aldo Clemens died on that table.
"Why torture him so horribly, but end it with a relatively quick, humane death?"
Maybe he got the information he wanted.
Maybe.
"But there's a cruelty to this killer, it doesn't fit."
BRENNAN:
I agree.
Cause of death was a transected cervical spinal cord.
We need to understand how that was done.
"Okay, well, all we have is a bloodstained table and a few strips of duct tape."
I have enhanced the stains here.
"Well, the largest concentration of blood will be where the rat cage was fixed to the ribs."
Can you align the body accordingly?
"Yeah, I'll center the stain on the eighth and ninth rib."
The remaining tape matches up with the arms and legs.
"Uh, this doesn't make sense."
The skull would need more range of motion for the spinal column to be transected.
"Okay, let me recreate the fracture to the C2."
SAROYAN:
You're right.
"Out to the movies, out to dinner, shopping, hiking, the gym."
I'm all for cutting out the gym.
"No, the shipment was for 1,400."
Not 14.
"Look, just deal with it, OK?"
Do you have any idea what you have done to my life and to Rebecca's?
- What I've done?
Are you serious?
- My God!
"As a mother, how could you be that cruel?"
My daughter is crushed.
"Her whole identity, everything that we had, our relationship has been decimated."
And all for what?
Out of spite?
So that you could get even with me?
But I just told her the truth.
I was planning on telling her everything on my timetable.
In my way.
- It was not your place.
- My place?
"Oh, you are unbelievable."
It wasn't your place to have an affair with a married man.
It wasn't your place to have my father's child.
It certainly wasn't your place to come crawling out of the woodwork and demand a piece of our family business!
"But none of that stopped you, did it?"
You've done nothing but cause my family pain.
"So if your perfect little world has come crashing down around you because the truth has come out, you know what?"
Join the damn club!
I let you treat me like dirt because I love and respected your father.
But I am done treating you with any measure of civility.
- Is that a threat?
- You bet your ass it's a threat.
But I know the feeling of wanting someone so much that it hurts.
"This fiction, known as love, drives people crazy, as you said."
"Then you're either mad, alone..."
Or dead.
But that was fiction.
Right!
We're dead!
"I do believe two people can come together, even marry, for reasons more concrete than sex."
"A love that grows in time out of respect, love, trust, common interest."
Have you noticed that friendships last longer than marriages?
The 12th century was on to something.
Would you like some coffee?
Tea?
- Got any scotch?
- Yeah.
Are you busy this week?
I was hoping you could help me with my teaching.
I'm sure you're much better than you give yourself credit for.
"Maybe you could sit in on one of my classes, tell me what you think."
"If X squared plus Y squared equals 16, how do we find DY, DX as an implicit function of X and Y?"
"Well, Y is a function of X..."
"You walk across the room like this, and you're into your own thing."
"Your body language is very detached, very alienating."
"I think you have to relate more to the kids, engage them."
"You're up there with your back to the room, solving your own problems."
"It's like you're having a math party, and you only invited yourself."
- No math party.
- No math party.
Relax.
Loosen up.
Have some fun.
Relax.
This season's about Starting over...
Hell yeah.
And getting this Mega dredge built.
"We got a long day Ahead of us, tomorrow."
In the glow of The golden nugget...
"Let's go to bed, man."
"Shawn heads for camp, Unaware that a determined rival."
Has reached the gates.
That mega dredge will Keep nome alive.
"I mean, you start bringing In $100,000, $200,000."
"A day into a small Community like that,"
It'll definitely be a really Good thing for nome.
"I guess this is where We're setting up camp, boys."
There's a lot of families that Depend on my business and me.
"I don't want to think about how Many people depend on me, but..."
"Long as I keep finding Big piles of gold,"
It should keep all These families happy.
We'll be nice and warm Here in a minute.
I have a feeling this winter Will be the best icemining.
Season I've ever had.
"I think it's the next Big gold rush, for me,"
And I think it'll have people Trying to come down there.
"To mine, but..."
"Not too worried about anybody Showing up anytime soon,"
Because it's taken me years To get ready for it.
"I mean, if people think They're gonna come up here."
"And do it in one season, They got..."
They got another thing coming.
Anything this tough Has got to be worth it.
"On the next episode of ""Bering sea gold""..."
"We're the reaper, and we've Come here to do business."
Ricky!
Is it?
I mean...
"Has it ever really been over, for you?"
"Monsieur, your generosity will not be overlooked or forgotten."
The Bible says that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter heaven.
That is true if the rich man does not repent of his sins.
But all who renounce Satan and are contrite are welcome in the house of God.
LOUIS:
Mmm.
I will pray for your soul.
"Word's spread that a man is visiting churches, handing out money and a crowd is gathering outside."
I suggest we return to the palace immediately.
Do you believe in heaven and hell?
"Yes, I believe I do."
"That a man will be punished for his wrongdoing, for his sins?"
"Yes, Your Majesty."
So do I.
I wish to visit the tomb of my father in Saint-Denis before we return to the palace.
(SNICKERING)
"Ah, after all the battles I've been in,"
I cannot believe that this is how I'm gonna die.
Watching the last barrel of wine spill into the dirt.
"I'm sorry about that, by the way."
I know.
Death is mocking me.
You know we're not going to die today.
You might want to tell them that...
"I'm not ready, not here, not like this, not now."
(LAUGHS)
And I've too much left to do.
"And I can't die without seeing Constance's face one last time, can I?"
Or laying eyes on the children we will have together.
The men you meet are often lots of fun.
"I mean, each ones different."
"One's fat, one's thin."
Some men have big ones.
some have small ones.
"Some men shoot huge loads, others almost nothing."
My potency lies in.
"as I discovered at some point, that I can shoot off a very powerful load of semen."
With it I've left many women pretty amazed.
"Because, and here I'm only guessing... because it must smack the vaginal wall pretty hard when I come."
And ladies must like to feel that.
"And if I do the famous coitus interruptus, and pull out and then shoot."
The ladies are amazed at the load that comes out of me.
Otherwise my potency isn't very different from other people's.
It's just my pressures really strong when it shoots out.
"- Thank you, mistress."
- The kilo weight!
"- One, mistress?"
"- Yes, one."
"Look, the cock weight's slipped again."
"I put such lovely ornaments on my penis, but they keep slipping."
- You can do the dishes now.
"- Thank you, mistress."
Let's check your posture.
It's my cock.
It's my scrotum.
My slave's body belongs to me.
I have total control over it.
I decide...
"I mean, except for personal hygiene, of course."
That's very important.
"At first he had to wear a chastity belt, because I forbid him to jerk off."
Charles.
- Yeah.
So there it is.
How can you choke someone to death if he could still breathe through his nose?
He could've been face down in the trunk of the car.
Malcolm Miller shoved that rag so far in the back of that boy's throat that it didn't matter that his nose was open.
Charles is right.
"If you shove something far enough in the back of somebody's throat, it cuts off the airflow from the nose."
What the hell does it matter?
You heard that man.
He confessed.
"If the police went after me, I'd tell them what they wanted to hear too."
"Yeah, they were like really mean."
"Regardless, there is something about this confession that rings true."
- This is a police recorded confession.
Of course it's coerced.
It's a police recorded confession.
He confessed of his own free will.
- He was in that room for more than 21 hours.
Okay?
Worn to the bone.
No offense but scared and confused don't add up to free anything.
That confession was bullshit.
"So, what, like it never happened?"
That's your position?
- That's my position.
It's not as if they were waterboarding him.
- They badgered him for an entire day.
That's it's own form of torture.
"Guys, we have a confession, we also have a witness who saw him driving away from the governor's house that night."
At 1 in the morning.
In the dark.
"Uh, a private investigator."
See...
You don't understand.
"Roger, wait!"
"I love you, Roger!"
Get in the car.
Oh!
Hold it!
U.S. Treasury Department.
You two are in big trouble.
It was a double blow to my ego.
"The good guys were bad guys, and vice versa."
"The dumb kid in the blue sedan turned out to be a mafia hit man, while gold teeth and his partner were really treasury agents."
"And all of them, including Barbara and I, were hunting for Roger."
"For different reasons, of course."
It seems the love of Barbara's life used to be Godfather Bracito's gardener.
"One day while tending the roses, he dug up two million from an armored car robbery... that had been cooling until the statute of limitations had run out."
Roger dropped it into a fertilizer bag and walked away.
In a funny way I had to admire him.
Walking out of a don's estate with two million in a bag of bat guano.
Barbara.
Barbara.
I can't believe it.
Why didn't he tell me?
"Well, maybe he loved you too much to involve you."
Oh.
You think so?
"Well, he wrote you all those letters after he already had the two million dollars."
How many guys do you know who would do that if they didn't love you?
We gotta find him.
"Oh, don't worry, Babs."
"This guy with the gun won't harm him until he has the money, and Roger's not dumb enough to tell him where it is."
Felt so bad.
"But, Pete, you were a trouper, though."
"Yeah, you lasted a long time, considering."
I made it look...
I puked with authority.
- I thought it was directorial.
- I thought it was good.
"Was it projectile, like that time when we put that hose up next to my face?"
"If you look carefully at the windshield of the Yugo, I did hit it."
"- No, stop."
"- Pete, tell me what..."
- We should talk about this.
"- That look you tell me to talk about all the time, now you say it."
"This is one of my favorite moments, you're looking at each other with that song before the moment's broken by Mike's voice in that CD."
But you were getting to know each other.
This was day six of shooting.
Is that right?
You have an incredible track of it all.
I can't believe you know what day is what.
- Yeah.
- Sorry to interrupt.
I wanna hear what you were gonna say about the look and stuff.
"So you guys were still getting to know each other and so, what I did was I asked Kat, who was off camera, to..."
"I didn't tell you about this, Mike but I asked Kat to put her hands on your legs but I asked Kat to put her hands on your legs and tell her how adorable she thought you were in Superbad."
- Did you put your hands on my leg?
- I can't remember.
I couldn't tell if you did.
I assumed you did because you did the rest of it.
- I couldn't tell where your hands were.
- I probably poked it.
- I don't wanna know.
- Didn't know where your hands were?
If you know what I'm saying?
"In fact, I've got something here you could use."
"I bought it for myself, but I think your need is greater."
-What is she going to bring out now?
"-No, I'm serious."
This'll be the perfect thing for you.
It's a candle.
"You light that for about 1 0 minutes, Just let it fill the room."
It's very sensual and very erotic.
ALICE:
"Well, that was a complete waste of time."
I've made myself feel totally sick now.
You should never try and achieve ecstasy on top of Horlicks.
The trouble is I get a sexual fantasy in my head and then I can't hold on to it.
My brain keeps wandering off.
"Like, I was just in the middle of this really exciting, intense, erotic act... and then I started worrying if it was illegal in certain states of America."
"And then for some reason or other, Ted Rogers appeared... doing that thing with his fingers."
Then after that it was just hopeless.
My dad always said I had a butterfly mind.
If only I could learn to concentrate.
1 2.:50.
I can't believe that dream I was just having.
It was so weird.
"God, when do I ever wake up physically aroused?"
Never.
"Maybe if I just empty out my mind and... completely relax, I can get back there again."
Gil.
Irene.
-How did you get in here?
-Through the front door.
"I've got all your keys, the alarm system."
"Look, I know this probably seems like a strange moment to call around for a chat, but...."
That's what you want the police to believe.
And that's why you protected Iris.
"Don't worry, Henry."
"As I speak, George is in the Police Station, confessing to the murder of Vera."
You will get your justice.
One question.
"When you heard the name Max, why were you certain that was George?"
Thomas told me that Vera was killed by a policeman.
"Will I go to hell for this, Father?"
Jesus commanded us not to judge.
God will have the final judgment.
But I tell you this...
Not for one second has He left your side.
I've just been on the phone to the Chief Constable.
You're free to go.
What?
You can't do this.
I'm just following orders.
I'm not going.
"You know what I think, Detective Inspector?"
That a bent copper is worse than any criminal.
That you should swing and heads should roll.
"But it's not me who decides, is it?"
"It can be, if you want it to be."
"Look, I'll get Goodfellow to throw you out if I have to."
"Inspector Mallory, if you do not charge me with the murder of Vera Blanchett, then I will add your name to the list that I give to the newspapers of all the coppers involved in this sordid business."
"And as the roof of this constabulary comes crashing down, you too will be buried forever."
Thank you.
I'm sorry that I've ended up... ..bringing you down with me.
At this moment I just want to come with you.
"No, Edie, you must stay and fight."
Your father's money I want you to take it.
"Something about ""My lieutenants and I are going to tunnel into my vault."""
"Tunnel, that's how most crooks get into vaults."
But into her own vault?
And she couldn't have gotten far.
She's left the Black Widow Cycle here.
This must be it.
And two for me.
Two for you.
And two for me.
Two for you.
"I wouldn't grow too attached to all of that if I were you, Black Widow."
"For heaven's sake, look who's here."
"You didn't count on us, did you, you sophisticated but evil woman?"
"As a matter of fact, no."
But how fiendishly clever of you.
"And how handsome you are, Bat-doll."
"Watch out for a trick, Batman."
"Don't worry, Robin."
She won't catch us off guard this time.
"You needn't try to short circuit our brains, Black Widow."
We're still wearing our anti-short circuit Bat-brain electrodes.
"Batman, I've lost one of my electrodes."
"Bad luck, old chum, but perhaps I can pull off a bluff."
No amount of UHF short circuiting can affect the brain of either Robin or me.
"Are you definitely wearing your electrodes, darlings?"
- Definitely.
-Definitely.
"Marvelous, because I've reversed the polarity on my brainwave short circuiter."
Just an added little precaution.
"And with the electrodes on, you've had it."
"You, she-devil."
Have you short circuited Batman's brain?
-A man named Spike Milligan.
"Oh, yeah, I think Dad's got a load of his books."
'Cause that's another thing.
No one I know ever reads.
I know.
It's one of the best things there is.
To lose yourself in a good book.
In fact... there's one I'm definitely going to lend you when I'm finished because...
I think you'd get a lot out of it.
Unspeakable.
Truly unspeakable.
It was just how I felt.
It makes one despair.
But... you cannot possibly know what I was reading.
"From your reaction, it can only have been that letter from some old colonel in Oxshott, or wherever it was, expressing support for America's adventures in the Philippines."
"Which any sane person knows is an act of the purest imperialism and he concludes with the comment,"
"""War is heck but they must not weaken in their resolve."""
"Can you imagine the warped morality of any man alive who would use the words ""war is heck""?"
I just thank heaven he is not my husband.
Just as everyday I thank heaven that you and I are together and that life is as perfect as it can be.
What is it?
What's wrong?
"No, no."
It's nothing at all.
"As you say, as perfect as it can be."
Some more tea?
GIL:
What am I doing here?
I'll probably find it was someone called Bill she wanted to see and she just didn't have her teeth in.
"But listen, it's an hour of my time and..."
maybe she just needs cheering up.
Er...
That being said...
-it is a horse.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?
The only other time you've become this emotional in here...
-it was those ducks.
-That was a whole different thing.
-They were ducks.
-Is it different?
You haven't grieved in this way for people.
"Your mother, your best friend."
Can't I just be sad for a horse without some touchy-feely...
Freudian shit component to it?
"When it was the ducks, it embodied feelings of dread... about your family, that something terrible was going to happen."
It's just the miserable way she died.
It just makes me wonder what kind of fucking toilet world we live in.
"A friend of the family, little boy... gets shot with an arrow, cuts off the flow of blood to his brain."
Thirteen years old.
"He's going to live, but he's never gonna be right."
-How awful for the parents.
-Yeah.
My nephew.
I love that kid like I love my son.
"But I think he's got a drug problem, heroin."
"It kills me just to say it, because I got so many hopes tied up in this kid."
This is Christopher?
"This 9/11 shit, I don't know."
The shit that's going on everywhere.
It's like some fucking asshole is stalking the human race.
"Anthony, do any of your associates think about any of this?"
"I don't know, we don't talk about it."
"I know it's fucking ridiculous, but I feel like the reverend Rodney King Jr., you know?"
"-""Why can't we all just get along?"""
"I know what we said, but we have changed our mind and we..."
we reconsidered your offer.
"And we think that actually it would go down quite well, because, er... see...that day that you talked about..."
( indistinct muttering )
"Um...deeper, baby , deeper ..."
"Ow, gross!"
You weren't suppose to like it!
oh...
"like I never do it, princess."
Have you gals heard about this guy?
"O.k , so basically there was this guy that stole some shit from Chet."
What did this guy take from him?
A truck full of cologne.
"Now, this truck contains something in addition to just cologne"
Something like what?
A bag full of money.
The weird part is that the guy called us up and then have the stones to taunt us after he did what he did.
Stones...
Or some kind of death wish .
Coz he obviously gave us his address .
"His name and number were clear as day, the whole time he was fucking with us ."
Cold Pepper lives about three blocks from this dude.
She has checked him out.
Says he's leaving in the morning comes back in the afternoon.
"When he comes home, you'll be waiting for him."
And that's that.
"The landlord is on our team, so the door will be open."
Better be!
Relax!
The door will be open .
And you don't have to worry about the noise either.
Why not?
It ends with Travis still alive.
"You know, Kai, just because you want that to happen doesn't mean that it will."
"You know, that might be something you need to face."

No.
No.

"That being said, raw food plus Dori equals a bathroom break every 20 minutes."
"Hey, maybe Erica can think of someplace we can go."
Eri-- actually...
I feel like Italian.
Carb cleansing's so 2005.
Ouch.
I can't believe that...
I actually thought that I was friends with him.
"Yeah, I kinda figured out he couldn't be trusted when I found his nail file sticking straight out of my back."
"Erica, it's awful, I know, but it is what it is."
Maybe if I could just talk to him away from here... or maybe you just need to accept that fact that your friendship has changed.
Probably for good.
Here it is.
Thanks.
"Hey, so, uh... how is this?"
"It's a little high on the left, you think?"
Maybe you didn't get the message when I walked out of here yesterday.
"No, I got it loud and clear."
Katrina.
I take it Louis got my lawsuit.
"He did, and I'm here to ask why you're bringing it now."
Because the things you're alleging he said...
Alleging he said?
Wow.
"I guess it's lawyer first, friend second."
That's not fair.
I'm only here because we're friends.
And because you wanted to convince me to forget that Pearson Specter Litt ruined my career.
"Stephanie, I know you got fired, but... this lawsuit could destroy Louis."
Let me get this straight.
"The woman who convinced me to leave a good job for one where I was treated terribly, sexually harassed, and then fired is now asking me for a personal favor?"
"Yes, I am."

"Well, I'm not in the mood to grant one."
So you can tell Louis I will see him in court.
"Stephanie, the woman I knew at Rand Kaldor Zane wouldn't do this."
Please... tell me what's going on so I can help.

"I heard people here talking, and they said that I got fired because I couldn't hack it."
"Well, that's not true, and I won't have them thinking it is."
"Then close that door and sit down, because I'm betting that we can work out a deal right now that shows anyone who's ever underestimated you just how strong you are."
"Alex, have you seen Donna by any chance?"
- What?
- Donna.
Have you seen her?
I need to tell her something.
"I don't know, Harvey."

What the hell's wrong with you?
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
BETH:
Do you want anything else?
"Yeah, less of the cardboard crap and more regular people food."
"Well, that cardboard crap is what we call whole-wheat toast."

"And a little plate of cold cuts, if there are any left."
"Hey, would you guys please just turn that down a bit?"
Dad's trying to sleep.
You think he wants to hang on to this vinyl?
My collection could use a lot of these.
Would you just turn it the fuck down?
"Well, we're totally out of toilet paper and all we have left to eat is some old jelly and some ramen noodles."

- No.
Doesn't matter.
So are you gonna leave him?
"Gigi, he's my husband."
He's not some guy who didn't call me back.
He did admit it to me.
"He didn't wait to get caught, which takes courage, you know?"
They won't get anything from me.
They are masters at exploiting weakness.
We all have weaknesses.
We all do.
And they will find yours.
What do you need me to do?
"We're gonna go through your file... and go over all the parts of your life... that make you the most vulnerable to them... financially, emotionally, sexually."
"No, no, no."
I-I'm not at all comfortable with this.
"Well, it's not my first choice either, but..."
I'm going to need you to tell me things... secrets that you might not have told anyone else.
Because that is where their power lies... in secrets.
If they can keep you afraid and ashamed... then they can keep you silent.
And if they can keep you silent... they can control you.
- Have you ever been engaged to be married?
- No.
- And how many close friends would you say you have?
- A few.
Not many.
Could you be more specific?
"Uh, two, I think."
"Um, you never really know enough about people though."
"So, are you gonna say that because I'm a loner, I'm more vulnerable?"
"Look, I'm not sure how they will approach you... but I am sure that they will."
All right.

I would never betray my country.

You have caused much heartache.
Never heeding my words.
"Fighting me at every turn, your ambition, the bolt hurled against my wishes."
And here is where it has led.
Two men at constant odds.
Mired in the ruins of what might have been.
Ruins I aided in creation.
"I wanted you to join me here, to see them buried."
"You are my son, Quintus."
"And I will always love you, no matter the path you take."
"What moves such downpour, after eternal drought?"
Tullius makes offer.
Position in the opening games.
- At what price?
- Gannicus.
And your response?
"Without meaning, if you are not by my side upon the day's arrival."
"You give me until tomorrow, and yet now press for answer?"
"A day, a year..."
A man either knows his heart or he does not.
"The founders of society, the heroes of the future."
"The future belongs to the unsung forces of common people, once organized."
Final Dis-Solution in champagne!
Can not say... anything right!
But... above all... must not kill...
with each and every thought!
With each bite!
Maybe teeth are for climbing trees.
Like big toes?
"Does another world exist, without cruelty, or would it be even more deformed, and uglier?"
"When I'm hungry and thirsty, who forces me to think of the blood, and the flesh that my neighbor ogles?"
of which slaughter house are we kids the inheritors?
"Watch out for the vase, cousin."
Why?
You're not good with reality.
"These clothes, this furniture, the prisons."
I'm the same.
I found a way out:
The theater.
You will see.
"It's not that place where oldies flock, and where my mother is a total flop."
"It can really blow your mind, make you die better and faster."
"Doesn't make you happy, but it shreds you up."
Better than anything.
I'd like to stay here.
It can be arranged.
I have killer thighs.
Simon's corpse can't say no to me anymore.
"That, I know how to do."
"We're all lost souls, souls lost in our flesh."
"You're lost in your flesh, Aglaé."
Do you understand?
Thanks for seeing me before work.
My door is always open.
It doesn't matter which door.
Come on in.
So you want to go on vacation with a seasoned FSB operative who very well may be on to you.
Or he may be letting his emotions guide his decisions.
And he's taking you to Cuba?
I know the risks.
"If I got caught, the extraction would be extremely high risk."
Extraction?
There would be no extraction.
"If you got caught, the Agency would have no recourse."
North Korea would be easier.
"Still, the potential benefit is huge."
Are you asking me to authorize a mission to Cuba?
"'Cause if you are, I can't give you that."
"But if you're telling me you're gonna go anyway,"
I can't stop you.
I can't use my regular passport.
The Agency would be able to track me.
So I need an outside forgery.
I know a guy.
"Simon saw my passport in Morocco, so the stamps would have to match exactly."
A replacement will find its way to you before your flight.
"Now, Simon will probably fly you through Mexico."
It's the easiest way to get Americans into Cuba.
"Once I land, there will be eyes on me."
Cuba has always been a hotbed of Russian spies.
They'd love to catch an outside player.
So don't get caught.
"Spycraft wouldn't be that much fun without the bad guys, now, would it?"
"Hey, are you busy?"
"- But still, we're happy like this."
...terracotta tiles cost less than these did back then.
"The cupboard cost 22,000."
The bench seat cost 21 .000 schillings back then.
The cupboards were all very expensive.
But it's not as pretty as what you get today.
"If I'd become a singer, I'd have sung the great in-between roles..."
"Othello, or Manrico in ""Trovatore,"" who sits well in my voice."
"Riccardo in ""Un Ballo."" Alvaro in ""La Forza del Destino."""
And also of course the lyrical roles.
"Rodolfo in ""Bohéme,"" who sits well in my voice, with my radiant high C"
I'd have sung many of the lyrical roles because of my lovely piano.
But with the size of my voice I could've sung the in-between roles.
Perhaps I'd have sung Wagner.
"We'll never know, because I didn't try."
But it might've been possible.
"In the room we're in now, neighbors often come visit."
At least once a week.
Then there are my band mates.
We rehearse here.
They get something to drink if they want.
And even if they don't want.
This is the cozy room where I spend most of my time.
An older man is sitting on the bus opposite a pretty young woman.
His fly is open.
"The young woman says, ""Sir, I think your Wiener is half out."""
"He says, ""You'll laugh, Miss, but that's all there is."""
The Hitler portrait behind me was a wedding gift from the guys at work and my buddies.
"Opening it, I went out of my mind."
I wanted to rush right home and hang it up in the basement.
It was the most wonderful wedding present I got.
"We go almost every year, so..."
That's just...
"I'm sorry, I can't hold hands with you."
I had no idea that you...
I thought you were like me.
I thought you'd missed the boat somehow.
Getting involved with a married man.
That's not who I thought you were.
"Stephenson, Sutcliffe, Taylor,"
"Ward, Williamson, Yardley."
"Right, have a look around at your tram group."
"If you don't see those faces at the tram stop tomorrow morning, you are on the wrong tram and you will not be making a record with the Halle Orchestra."
Oi!
"That was a waste of a halfpenny, wasn't it, Hewitt?"
These trams have been put on specially for you to get to the Free Trade Hall.
We don't want anybody coming on milk floats or getting lifts on a dust cart.
"Yes, Baker, I'm looking at you."
"You're not on the tram, you're not coming in."
"In fact, I am going to say that anyone not arriving on time will not only be prevented from taking part in the recording, but will be asked to leave the choir altogether."
Singing tomorrow is going to be the happiest moment of my life.
Very good.
You get off.
Big day tomorrow.
I can manage.
"So our record that we're making, Mr Kirkby, if they sell it in Woolworths, I'm going to buy it for Mam and play it her."
Play it her on what?
A mangle?
"No, I've got a gramophone."
"Yes, and I'm Rupert the Bear."
"No, I have got one."
"Come on, Mr Kirkby, come with!"
Very nice model.
"Not that we should be ""Laying up treasures on earth"
You've been one of them all along?
I oughta knock you flat on your back!
"Well, I wouldn't blame you, Matthew."
"Truth is, you already floored me once."
You were never supposed to get to Mace.
That's why they partnered us - said I'd make sure you stuck to wild goose chases.
Mm.
"You see, I figured Malone's stepson was just another dead end."
"After all, the guy hadn't seen Mace since, what, 1924."
But then... (laughs) you had to muck everything up with that photograph and the Flora Dreidel connection.
"- I mean, who knew?"
"- I'm not laughing, Hacker."
"Neither are we, Matthew."
"Like Mace said, you impressed us."
The pin makes it official.
You passed the test.
You're Illuminati now.
But wh?
Goliath got away.
Your job was to get him there.
It's not your fault if old Mace couldn't hold him.
"- See you again soon, Matthew."
"- Yes, you will."
(under breath) And that's a promise.
"The big new accessory with eyeglasses seems to be that strap that connects so you can take them on and off which I don't get because if you have glasses, isn't that because you need to wear glasses?"
"""You need glasses."" Isn't that what they say?"
An eye doctor doesn't say:
"""Would you care for some glasses?"""
People with crutches don't have a chain attached to their belt so they can just let go of them every now and then.
Why not get a toupee with a rubber band for water- skiing?
The thing could just...
"Discussing deep-laid plans, I'll wager."
[ Laughs ]
I cannot wait to see them evolve.
Trelane... we haven't planned--
Tut-tut.
Do not think that I deplore your martial virtue of deception and stratagem.
Quite the contrary.
I have nothing but admiration for your whole species.
"If your admiration is genuine, you must have respect for our sense of duty."
Our ship needs us.
We have tasks to perform.
"Oh, I can't let you go now."
I was getting a bit bored until you came.
You must stay.
I insist.
For how long?
Until this is over.
Until what is over?
"Dear Captain, so many questions."
Make the most ofan uncertain future.
Enjoy yourself today.
Tomorrow... may never come at all.
"Even if we wanted to stay, our companions are missing us."
"Yes, I must experience your sense of concern, your grief at the separation."
There are 400 men and women aboard that ship.
Women?
Do you mean that you actually have members of the fairer sex among your crew?
"Oh, how charming."
Ha ha.
And they must be all very beautiful.
And I shall be so very gallant to them.
"Here, let me fetch them down at once."
"Caitlin, if you'll just listen..."
"I heard you, you're sorry."
I get it.
"Truthfully, I'm not sorry."
Tonight was the best night of my life.
Gary...
"Given the chance, I'd do everything exactly the same."
"Caitlin, honey, you coming ?"
"Oh, yeah, just give me one second."
"Okay, we'll wait for you in the car."
"Look, I should go."
"But I am into ice cream, and you're obviously hooked up as far as that goes."
And the makeover was pretty successful.
And the asthma attack had me completely fooled.
Sweet.
"So I guess once you guys get this place back up and running,"
I'll come stop by.
Gold Medal Ribbon on the house.
Best... earthquake... ever.
"Dr. Harris, are those my wife's tests ?"
"Oh, no, Mr. Cohen, it's going to be awhile before we get the results."
"Oh, of course, it's just a little bit too soon for that."
I know you have your hands full.
"Yes, we have a pretty full house right now."
"Well, as soon as you know anything, you know, good or bad... if you could please let me know."
"I will, of course."
"Let me know first, just so I can prepare my wife."
Of course.
Thank you.
"I mean, it's kind of crazy in that we have two other boys that are just going off to college, so we were expecting to have an empty nest, you know, when then, all of a sudden,"
"this unplanned, miraculous event and, well, uh, the fact of the matter is,"
"I can't imagine anything worse than an empty nest, so, uh..."
Slaves!
"Come on, Leonard, if you're going to teach history, these are the kind of facts you'll have to know."
You know what?
Never mind.
I'm going to tell him it's okay to ask her out.
The question is moot.
"There is no way that Stuart, an impoverished peddler of picture books, would be at all appealing to Amy Farrah Fowler, a noted neurobiologist capable of performing surgery on her own feet with nothing but nitrous oxide from cans of whipped cream as anesthesia."
"All right, but for the record,"
I checked in with you to see how you'd feel about it.
Fine.
The record shall so reflect.
"Now, getting back to the problem at hand, what to do with a washed-up experimental physicist..."
I am not washed-up.
"Oh, Leonard."
"Lots of people love you and want to help you, but they can't until you admit the problem."
"Well, ladies, we killed the bottle."
I had half a glass.
I didn't have any.
"Okay, don't judge me."
"So, what do you want to do-- go to the movies, go dancing, lay down for a little bit?"
Or we play...
Travel Twister.
"Amy, really?"
Twister?
Excuse me.
I've passed many an enjoyable evening playing this game.
And I'm sure it's a lot more exciting when you play with other people.
"What do you say, bestie?"
We can do shirts and skins.
I'm shirts.
Called it.
(cell phone buzzing)
She wants asylum.
"Mr. mooney, don't be fooled."
This is certainly not her first trip into the states carrying drugs.
"Her passport indicates she's been here twice before, and that's just this passport."
She's still a 10-year-old girl who needs a chance.
"I understand that, but I can't change the rules."
I'll pay Liz 1 and a half million.
"Ok, we need to get to 2."
[Whispering] 2 and a half.
2.5.
"There's nothing I'd like better than to pay Liz your number, but we're in the second straight year of an ad decline"
"Brian, Liz doesn't have to sell."
She's posting strong growth even in this slow time.
"I mean, let's face it."
This is the top ad firm in the city.
"Now either you want to do business with this woman, or you don't."
"All right, let me talk to my board."
Your board?
It was my understanding that you could get to yes.
I can.
Ms. hetherington offered you an exclusive first-look option because she believed that you would negotiate in good faith.
1.75 million.
"2.5 for that, she has to sign a 5-year employment agreement with strict non-compete terms."
"No, Brian, that ties up too much of her time."
"Without Liz, this company is nothing but phones and paper, and we'll expect her to get a life insurance policy."
"That's not a problem, is it?"
No.
"No, it's not a problem at all."
[Knock on door]
Come in.
Burton.
I'm confused.
When I had some real problems...
I couldn't go to none of them about it.
"You know, I was having some problems with Catherine's family and my family... and I said, you know, ""Coach Pingatore, their family's been getting on me about... you know, I'm not doing this, and I'm not doing that. """
And the only thing Coach Pingatore could say is...
"""Write 'em off. """
That was all he told me.
"And I was, like, ""What kind of advice is that?"""
"Well, how's it feel to be finishing?"
"Uh, I mean-"
"Now, don't say anything you don't mean, William."
"I mean, I'm serious, Coach."
I enjoyed my four years.
"I mean, we had our run-ins, and, uh -"
- Who had run-ins?
- Me and you.
- We did?
- Yeah.
Like that time you made me run 75 stairs.
- I never f-
- You never forgot that.
Never.
"See,you should have been happy and enthusiastic about doing your punishment."
"But someday you're gonna learn that, uh... everything that was done was for your benefit."
"So that you can come back four years from now and say, ""Coach,you were right."
"""Everything that happened at St. Joe's helped me a lot... and as a result I got a degree. '"""
That's what I'm hoping for.
"I'm going into communication... so when you start asking for a donation, I'll know the right way to turn you down."
I'm sure you'll never turn us down.
Ah.
I never really felt that he bought into the system.
he was never convinced what he was doing was the right thing to do.
But overall he had a good career- not a great career.
What?
"I don't think there are enough holes here, from that first time me and Daisy came out blastin'."
Is that important?
Could be.
In any case I've a feeling that my partner is not exactly holding' up her end.
I've never... actually... really ever killed anybody.
I've been using blanks.
I just make sure me and Violet don't share ammunitions.
"Like I said, she's so fierce and thorough on the job."
"I could pack a squirt gun, it just wouldn't matter."
"How do you mean, holding up her end?"
"I mean, that I might be the only one takin' up the trash."
- Means it looks like she's been packin' blanks.
- So what?
- So what?
"- Yea, so what?"
"Even if she isn't taking people out, isn't it better that she's with you?"
You think your partner's having two targets instead of one?
but it saved you behind a time or two?
"Do you understand, she's risking her life as well?"
Do you think your friendship might've helped keep you sane?
- as you wandered through this life of yours?
- There's still the principle.
"We have rules and what she might've been doin', is a big no-no, no matter how you slice it."
Cos one day you're packin' blanks and the next you're wearin' the wire.
So what you're going to do about it?
"I might've to take her out, if my suspicion is true."
I thought Daisy was your friend.
I'm not sayin' I'm gonna like it.
I thought you said she was like family?
She is.
"But she's a business woman too, so she'll understand."
It looks like it's working.
How long has he been sick?
"Oh, since he was three."
Kyle has polycystic kidney disease.
"We didn't know when we got pregnant, but James and I both carry an abnormal gene that causes PKD."
How long has Kyle been on the NTCC list?
Two year.
"But, uh... we just keep praying for a miracle."
So anyone suddenly come into a kidney?
The only folks that dropped off the transplant list died.
John Doe's kidney could've gone into someone from out of town.
Let's focus on finding the surgeon and the next buyer.
James McGovern?
"He was debt free, so to speak, until two weeks ago."
McGovern took out a second mortgage.
Cash advances on his credit card.
And drained Kyle's college fund.
- The TOF?
"- $125,000."
Which was wired yesterday into the personal account of our favorite local body snatcher.
Russ Bianco.
"Okay, I made a deal with James McGovern."
So you admit you sold him a kidney.
Did I say that?
"See, I don't think I said that."
"He wants to be a wise ass, let's let the feds deal with him."
"Yeah, they're gonna need someone to testify against me, so good luck. / You really enjoy playing god, don't you?"
I'm saving lives.
"I'm a hero, man, I'm the future."
I connect the needy with the need.
"Yeah, you're a real humanitarian using the poor as spare parts suppliers for people with money."
"The donor gets paid, a dying person lives, everybody wins."
"Let's get out of, here guys!"
Why?
Don't you like the uniform?
"I don't think it suits me, sir."
"But if my father were alive, I would've wanted him to see me in it."
My father was a much better shipwright than I'll ever be.
"Shipwrights are lowborn, and his grief was never getting the recognition he deserved..."
But I think he would've told me to take off this uniform as well.
He would've yelled at me and said it doesn't suit me.
Turn around.
Now.
It fits you perfectly.
Your father would've been very proud of you.
He would've never told you to take off this uniform.
Sir...
I'm a father with sons as well.
And I know all about father's pride.
I'm sure you know the importance of the ships you will have to build and maintain.
I am counting on you.
I'm confident that you'll build stronger and more powerful ships than ever before.
Do not be defeated and do not yield.
The only way to overcome their prejudice and intolerance is to build the best warships and become the best ship builder in Chosun.
Then this country will remember you as a great hero.
High commander...
This is one Kang Bao from the Grand Creek.
He stole a sack of rice from the house of Du Joo-young of neighboring village.
So?
"Pardon, sir?"
So what's his punishment?
Twenty lashes and a fine would be a fitting punishment.
Then be it.
"Yes, sir."
I can't help you.
You can't attack Jang Bogo in your state.
"I will help you settle in China, if you will sever your ties with me and go to China."
"Are you telling me to disappear, now that you have no use for me?"
You must take a hard look at the reality.
You are cornered now.
Death is what awaits you if you are stubborn.
I have already staked my life.
"If you refuse my request for help, you will also lose everything."
You wish to bring me down with you?
Do you think I will succumb so easily to your threats?
"You, who have so much to protect, would be afraid to die, but I have nothing more to lose."
"Since you are wise,"
I'm certain you will make the right decision.
What happened?
Is she willing to help us?
She wouldn't be able to refuse my request.
"With Master Yi's death,"
Yum Moon's fury has reached its limit.
Harm may come to you if you say no to him.
- Captain.
- Yes.
Find a way to help Yum Moon as he requested.
"Yes, madam."
Stop!
We will exclude those who still haven't mastered the basic skills.
- Sort them out.
"- Yes, sir."
It's not easy for the fishermen to master martial arts skills.
Has anyone gone far out to sea to fish?
How far have you gone?
I almost reached Japan once.
LAUGHTER
And he has...he has the body of a teenager.
"He's very lithe, he's very limber."
"But every four songs, he has to have a sit-down and he has a Q  A with the manager."
"But the Q  A is like,"
"""So, Cliff, you've just sung a song that says,"
"""'I'll love you till the 12th of never"
"""'and that's a long, long, time' -"
"""Wouldn't you say that's how your fans feel about you?"""
"And he'd be like, ""Yes, yes, it is."""
"And like, ""Aren't you bigger than Elvis?"""
"""Well, I never kept any records, but when this song was released,"
"""it stayed for eight weeks in the charts."
"""Elvis was only in the charts for seven weeks."
"I beat him."""
"Literally, he knew all the stats."
"And then, he was like, ""So what's happening to all The Shadows?"""
"""Well, Hank Marvin released an album of Django Reinhardt covers."
"""Yes, it didn't sell any copies, but you should check it out."
"""I think it's available for free on YouTube."""
"So, he's dicking on all his old mates, saying he's bigger than Elvis, and these..."
lunatic menopausal women are screaming at him.
"It was the single best night of my life, it really was."
Nothing wrong with being menopausal.
Absolutely
- I am!
"So, um..."
"But I was sat next to a guy and his brother and they were both from Sheffield, and the brother looked incredibly pissed off, and he was like, ""I'm a big Morrissey fan."
"""Are you a Morrissey fan?"" Yeah, we're Morrissey fans."
"He said, ""I've got to bring my brother."
"""My brother has seen Cliff 60 times,"
"""so it would have been the perfect ever gig."""
"Do you see what happened to that circle, sir?"
"When I dropped my hands, the circle dropped, too."
"Now, when I first saw Mrs. Daley's body,"
I noticed that she was wearing one of those tight-fitting dresses.
"And that the bullet hole in the dress was about an inch below the actual wound in her body,"
which meant that she had to be holding her hands up when she was shot.
"And she couldn't be running away, could she?"
"I mean, with her hands standing like this."
No one runs for their lives with their hands straight up.
"So, either she was walking with her hands straight up or she was standing still with her hands straight up when the gunman shot her in the back."
Very well done.
But I wish you had said something before about this.
"It would've saved us a lot of time, wouldn't it?"
"Well, we're back to our deliberate murderer, aren't we?"
And this time there's no doubt about it.
"Really, Lieutenant, really well done."
MAN:
"Ward, the car's ready to leave for the back lot."
COLUMBO:
This is what the police artist came up with.
WARD:
"Not much help, is it?"
"No help at all, sir."
I shouldn't have wasted your time.
"Well, I'll just let myself out."
Thank you very much.
Where is the...
Oh!
There's the door.
"Lieutenant, where do you think he got the costume?"
"Well, funny you should mention that, sir."
I've been asking myself that same question all day.
"She's trying to get a divorce, but it's not working out so well."
I'm just curious.
Tell me the truth.
You saw everything.
There was no one.
Was there?
No.
Moonsook.
And did you hear my confession to you?
"Yes, I did."
"I know I'm hopeless, but I'm struggling with those bad images."
"And, I've got to write a script."
I'm using all my mental capacity.
This is something I realized a while back.
"And since I'm fighting with images again,"
I have more confidence in it now.
Look here.
Your actions now and my obsession with purity are all images.
We're repeating images imprinted on us by others.
Look at this.
Let's assume that this is the real thing.
This constantly changes and has infinite curves.
"Let's say, for example, here, here, here."
People keep focusing on these points.
"Then, there is an image that recurs."
Like so.
You having sex with foreigners.
Let this be the face of the woman having sex.
"And this, the image of his phallus."
"And this, the weird position you'd see in porn movies."
"When these three images form a set, it coincides with the existing bad image."
"Then, the real thing disappears and only the image remains."
I forgot how satisfying that can be.
It's been a long time since you talked about teaching.
"Yeah, I know."
I was surprised when the feeling hit me.
I was also surprised when the head of the computer science program mentioned an adjunct professorship.
"Stephen, that's great."
Two job offers.
"No, no, no, just the one."
I turned it down.
Why?
"Well, you wanna get back in the public sector, and I already have a fantastic job."
"I mean, it's a great salary."
I'd be the senior VP in charge of software development.
"Yeah, at a company that makes elevator control panels."
"Well, it's not as exciting as a career change, I admit, but at least this time around, I won't have an evil boss."
How'd it go?
Mission accomplished.
Excellent.
So far.
"What you are planning here is so out there, there is no way everything will go right."
Suzy Cynic.
"Kyle, your plan is genius!"
"It's totally optimistic, at least what I understand of it."
Thank you.
So what's next?
"Well, Jessi got the alarm code, and you got her to pull down the shade, so on to Phase Two."
Here you go.
Phase Two.
Now we just wait for dark.
"I have unwavering faith and fully support your exploits, but how is that a plan?"
You got something better?
"It's just that there's a lot at stake for Kyle's sake, and I don't want anything to go wrong."
So we get Hilliard to coach him.
"Some sort of a...on the spot ""dumb show"" so that the Yank knows what he's supposed to be doing."
"Gentlemen, I fear that there has been some sort of misapprehension."
I'm an actor.
By somewhat derided calling but mine nonetheless.
"Perhaps because we're engaged in an imitation of life, there's a common misconception, that anything living can do what we do."
"You have found not to be so, for which I offer my....sincerest consolations."
"I'm an actor, I know only my art."
Of teaching.
Of coaching.
"Of ""dumb show""."
"These things, I'm afraid, I know nothing."
I'm so sorry to disappoint.
Mr.Hilliard. You're right.
You're right.
Everything you just said.
It's about respect.
For the art and for the artists.
"And it makes me think, how wrong we've been, playing Uncle Frank for laughs."
"Yes, he's a drunkard and a clown."
But he's also all those people who gave their sons to one war and now their grandsons to another.
If we served that truth.
"If we gave you an Uncle Frank really worth your time and your talent,"
"I wonder, if you would consider putting that same time and talent with helping Mr.Lundbeck... and the picture."
Hm...
I don't think we've been properly introduced.
I'm Catrin Cole.
I'm one of the writers.
Catrin.
"Between us, we'll have them weeping in the aisles."
I need to let Ellis know that I won't be there for his opening.
I'll arrange a telegram.
The law says that you can't save him this way.
"Now, doctor... please go check on your patient before we take you in."
"That boy shouldn't have to suffer because of this, John."
NTCC decides who gets the organs.
Maybe they can work this out.
"Okay, bring Swan and McGovern in."
"Once everything's under control, I'm gonna tell the NTCC we've got a kidney."
- We can't accept that kidney.
- Why not?
Our guidelines strictly forbid transplanting any organ that's been paid for.
- These are extenuating circumstances.
- Doesn't matter.
Using that kidney would irreparably tarnish our reputation.
Screw your reputation.
That kidney will save a child's life.
We have a hard enough time finding organs.
"Word gets out we're accepting them from people who've been paid, the whole system would fall apart."
- Everyone would want money.
- So that's it.
You're just gonna turn your back on a healthy kidney.
"I'm sorry, detective."
But I have no choice.
"John, the NTCC won't take it."
Doesn't matter.
Swan says Kyle is too unstable right now to take the transplant.
I'll see you back at the squad.
Thanks for coming in.
Where are they?
What are you talking about?
"Well, I just spent the last 15 minutes looking for Munch, McGovern, and the doctor."
They're not here?
"I checked interrogation, interview upstairs."
"Dad, Judy's in serious trouble."
I have the results of the tests.
Her blood pressure is 80 over 120.
Her respiration rate is 7 a minute.
"And the EKG, well, shows a very decreased rate."
"The EEG... well, that's all spread out."
"Dad, you've gotta come back and take care of Judy."
"Paula, your eyes must be playing tricks on you."
"Why, those readings would mean that Judy must've been under tremendous strain for quite a while."
"Dad, I'm worried about Judy."
She fell asleep before I could give her a sedative.
"Oh, well, honey, I don't think there's anything to worry about."
"You know, very often after a traumatic experience such as a leopard attack an animal will fall into a deep sleep."
"No, I think she'll be fine just as soon as she wakes up."
(PAULA):
"Well, I hope so."
How's the search for Sally coming?
"Well, Hedley and I are on the outskirts of Watuba village."
Hold on a second.
Here he comes now.
"The chief said he heard drums from the Cayuba Gorge section saying that a giant silver bird with red, white, and blue feathers"
- came out of the sky.
"- Hey, Paula, did ya hear that?"
"Well, that could be the spaceship with the NASA parachute."
"Yes, we're gonna go check it out."
"Oh, Dad, I haven't been able to get in touch with Jack or Mike."
They seem to be out of my range.
Don't you think you and Hedley should go looking for them?
"Oh, don't worry, honey, they can take care of themselves in any situation."
"Everything's gonna be all right, Sally."
All right.
"Now then, Sally, did this little interruption upset you?"
That's interesting.
You're an educated man.
What do you think of this ceremony?
How can I put it?
It's painful.
There have been two lines on my mother's face for years.
- Lines?
"- Yes, lines."
You mean scars?
"Yes, scars."
They are marked during the ceremony.
The first scar was for the death of my aunt.
My poor mother did it to show her love to my father.
"The second, was for the boss of the factory where my father worked."
One of his cousins had died.
"So that my father wouldn't lose his job, my mother mourned a great deal."
She scratched her face.
I couldn't believe it.
There was a lot of competition at the factory between the men to hold onto their jobs.
"Need and necessity, you see?"
Everyone played along.
There was a great deal of pressure.
They all needed work.
"No question of showing pity or giving in, everyone displayed themselves, pushed themselves forward to please the boss."
Each wanted to show that he grieved more than the others.
That he was with him.
That he was loyal...
That kind of thing doesn't interest me.
"When I think about it, it's painful."
let me tell you... I think the origins of this ceremony are bound to the economy.
What I just told you is engraved in their memories. lt has been for years and for generations now.
You look on it from the outside.
That's their business!
You must admit there's too much chauvinism in bullfighting.
But there are exceptions.
El Nino de Valencia was happy to share billing with you for several months.
That's over now!
Do you think it was all just a show to promote himself and when he'd done that he left you?
I told you earlier I wouldn't talk about that!
"But it's good to talk, honey."
And talking about problems is the first step in overcoming them.
- El Nino de Valencia...
- That's enough!
"Lydia, darling, don't be rude and let me finish the question."
I told you earlier I didn't want to talk about that.
You didn't tell me anything earlier.
"And I don't like you saying that, because people may think we plan the interviews, and I don't do that."
I only do live.
"I'm one of the few who dare to do that, just as you should dare to admit you were used, because El Nino de Valencia was using you!"
"A man who shared not just fame and the bullring with you but your bed as well, dumped you when it suited him."
"Hello, Juan Luis."
It's Marco.
How are you?
I wanted to ask you something.
I'd like to do an article on Lydia Gonzalez.
"Yeah, I'm watching it too."
I'd like to do something in depth.
For the Sunday issue?
Great!
She's gone nuts.
She's dedicating it to you.
She'd let the bull rip her apart just so that you could see it.
"We shouldn't have come, especially you."
I know what I'm doing.
"Why would this guy come after me, man?"
I've never even seen the coins.
"He probably won't, but we don't know that for sure."
[Sighs]
Now all three guys involved in the jewelry store robbery were also involved in the killing of my parents.
I just found out Kimura was tied to them.
He might be the last link I have to find out why my parents were killed and who killed them.
Okay.
I got it.
"He's super dangerous, and you want to catch this piece of garbage alive."
I want him alone and not in an interrogation room.
So you want a little Grimm time?
Yeah.
I could probably help you with that.
I think I found just what you need.
"Says here this Grimm captured this Siegbarste with his trusty crossbow and an arrow filled with schlaftrunk, which is basically a sleeping toxin."
He was able to subdue the big fella with one shot to the neck.
And they were able to keep him alive?
"Uh, yeah."
"Just long enough to draw and quarter him, which is not actually as easy as it seems."
"You need a lot of ropes and chains and, like, a minimum of four horses, but all you need is some schlaftrunk."
Let's hope your aunt has some.
Got it.
How much do we need?
There's not much left.
[Flipping pages]
"Um, they don't really say in the book."
Here.
Well...
"If you're supposed to use an eyedropper,"
I'd say a little probably goes a long way.
It better.
Your capitalism rests on the back of third world countries.
No one's hands are clean.
No one is innocent.
"Those people tonight, they were innocent."
They never hurt you.
They hurt me by existing.
"Yes, the infidels shall fall at the hands of the righteous."
And that is when the Jihad will end.
So you are ready to murder 4 billion people.
America has learned nothing from the past.
"You harden targets like your power plants, but you leave the soft root for our taking."
"What has happened tonight will affect your economy for years, the way september 11th affected air travel."
"And maybe the next time a giant shopping center opens, people will think twice before going."
And maybe next it will be a school.
Hey!
"You can shut the video feed down now, Garcia, thanks."
Has the sun not set yet?
No.
A shopping center.
A mall.
It's a grand opening tonight not long after sunset.
That gives you about an hour.
God help us if they don't make it.
- Let's hope we have somewhere to go.
- Grand opening of the USA mall today.
"It's the third largest in the country, and it's right smack in the middle of McLean, Virginia."
Let's move.
What's going on with you?
You look like you've seen a ghost back there.
Haley's supposed to take Jack to the new mall to have his portrait taken.
"- Well, go ahead and call her."
- It's a breach of security.
What's wrong with me?
What's the last thing you remember?
"My mom and I were going to the mall... and it was snowing,"
Were we in an accident?
Is she okay?
"I didn't treat her, but, let me see what I can find out, okay?"
- How is she?
- She doesn't remember anything.
What are you gonna tell her?
I don't know.
"Your mother's dead, and you've been in a coma for six years?"
How are those kids doing?
They're hanging in there.
I got ahold of an aunt and uncle.
They're with them right now.
"Inez, walk with me."
Do I have to?
- I better get into this.
"- I think you have just fantastic potential, but in every spare moment, you've got to be in there honing your skills."
- Got a second?
- Not really.
"If you're so concerned with the efficiency of this department, then you need to allow those of us who work well together"
- to continue to do so.
- If you're referring to the...
"And if you want us to act like professionals, then you need to treat us as such."
You saw me in there with Dr. Kovac.
You saw how well we work together.
"If that doesn't prove that we can work the same shift, then I don't think you know your job as well as you think you do."
Feel better?
FYI:
I already changed the schedule.
You're back on your old shifts next week.
"If you can hear me, sweetheart, please listen carefully."
There's something I need to tell you.
"I've been a bad mother, and I did a terrible thing to let this happen to you."
It's all my fault.
You deserve better than this.
You deserve so much more.
Even though I know you're brave...
"And you're not crying, you need to know I cried for you."
You're so much stronger than I am.
Stronger than I am.
"Honey, if you come home safely now, I promise"
I will love you and hold you and never let any more harm come to you.
"If you can hear me now, please call as soon as you can."
You know how to reach me.
I promise I will explain to you once and for all why I did what I did.
"Ok, it's over."
You did great.
You did great.
We'll keep bodies on ice for as long as 3 or 4 months.
"If nobody claims them by then, they get buried on the city's dime."
And Mrs. Sorenson's son never showed up?
"No, ma'am."
"We tried to track him down, but..."
This is it.
Pretty sad.
You live your life and you end up like unclaimed baggage.
"Hotch, we solved the mystery of the bone fragments in the hourglass."
"Patrick was going to have that reunion with his mother, one way or another."
"Patrick Sorenson has to be holed up nearby, but where?"
"Someplace secluded, that's for sure."
Hauling a corpse through the front door would tend to perk up the neighbors.
"Well, if there was an 11-hour clock on Josie Zumwalt, the bell just rang."
High school graduation is done a little differently.
Who needs pomp and circumstance when you have paparazzi?
"Ever since ""gossip girl"" broke my arrest"
It has been everywhere.
"Do you know eric found it in ""pravda""?"
You're famous because you got arrested.
Of course this happened to you.
I just can't wait for this day to be over.
"The end of high school means the end of me on ""gossip girl."""
"No, she has plagued you more than anyone."
"You were her first blast ninth grade, if i remember correctly."
It involved a white dress some rain
And a recently docked aircraft carrier?
"Okay, let's just hope that my mug shot is"
The last thing she ever prints about me.
Look on the bright side.
Gossip girl does not report on college
So this is your last day to be under her rule.
Okay can you just take my mind off of me?
- Talk about anything.
- Did he say it like...
"- Anything but-- ""i love her""?"
"- ""i love her""?"
"- ""i love her?"" - i totally set myself up for that one."
B.i don't know why you're acting like this is new information.
You know how chuck feels about you.
The problem isn't his feelings.
It's his inability to express them to the right person.
Who cares who he tells if he doesn't tell me?
Does he even know that you and nate broke up?
Have you not told him?
It's not like we stay up at night
I hope you realize that kidnapping's a criminal offense.
"My experiments are more important than the law, Letha."
"With these receptors placed on certain people, combined with this boy's powers,"
I could become one of the most influential men in the world.
"Oh, you are absolutely brilliant, professor."
"Now we can go ahead with my plans, too."
Don't bother me with your plans.
"They're empty, unimportant."
"A comment, perhaps, on you and the life you've been leading."
"Now, you look here, doctor, professor, physicist."
Whatever you are.
I built this laboratory for you at great expense.
I used every penny I had.
"Now, we've made a lot of plans and I won't let you upset them."
I want some money.
Fast.
"Letha, we are worlds apart."
My mind is filled with large concepts.
"Mankind, the universe."
You only worry about the horse that's running in the third race.
"Sure, I gamble but with my own money."
You're the worst kind of gambler.
You use other people's money and want to keep all the winnings for yourself.
"Well, you can be sure of one thing, Victor."
I'll be around to pick up the chips with you.
We'll be back in the morning with maps and breakfast.
I'll bring an egg from my refrigerator.
And I'll bring some day-old bread.
- I'll bring some milk for you.
- Thank you.
- You're good friends.
- That's the trouble with us.
"Tell me, what does this girl have that you don't?"
You mean besides millions of dollars and an abusive rock-star boyfriend?
That's what's wrong with our society.
"See, we emphasize beauty to such a degree, it's downright unhealthy."
"Hey, look, a pill to stop hair loss."
"Hey, Salem."
Want to see the dress that's going to get me elected
Queen of the Snowflake Ball?
Put it on.
"But I should warn you, I can be catty."
It's the only one they had;
isn't it perfect?
Except for the fact that it's one size too small.
I see.
"In your world ""perfect"" means ""doesn't fit."""
"And since it's an Other Realm original, it can't be altered."
Really?
Now I know why the Other Realm trails behind Paris as the fashion capital.
"Okay, well, if I can't alter the dress,"
I'll alter myself.
I'll diet.
"I've never done it before, but how hard can it be?"
"Yeah, the fact that weight-loss products comprise a billion-dollar industry is probably just a funny coincidence."
"Good morning, Sabrina."
How would you like your eggs?
"Oh, as far away from me as possible."
I'm on a diet so I can fit in my new dress and be elected Queen of the Snowflake Ball.
"Hmm, and if you go down two dress sizes, you can get into an Ivy League school."
You're fine just the way you are.
Fine?
Harvey and I are competing with two other really cute couples.
Fine is going to come in third.
You're crazy!
We get along better than most married couples.
Why shouldn't a man want to marry the woman he loves?
Because the woman is in a coma!
"Because Alicia can't say with any part of her body: ""I do!"""
Because we don't know if vegetative life is really life!
Get in the car.
How can you say that?
Get in the car!
Your relationship with Alicia is a monologue and it's insane.
I'm not saying talking's no use but people talk to plants and they don't marry them!
I can't believe you're saying that.
I thought you were different.
"Promise you won't mention it again, or even think about it!"
Promise me!
Why?
"If you say that to anyone else, you'll be in big trouble, and I won't be there to help you."
"If it'll make you happier, I promise."
However much we like her...
Do you like her too?
"Of course, how couldn't I?"
She likes you too.
"Benigno, Alicia is practically dead!"
"She can't feel anything for anybody, not for you, not for me, not even for herself!"
Get that into your head!
Our patient Alicia Roncero has been raped and is pregnant.
I haven't told her father yet because first you're going to tell me what bastard did that in my clinic.
"Sir, we all feel extremely concerned."
You should be feeling responsible.
Alicia was on your floor.
Then let me be the one to explain the situation.
"Rosa, please..."
- It was really cold.
"It was, like, October, November in New York."
We were all in these huge warming coats when we weren't shooting.
Which almost made it worse because you'd get warm and take it off.
That's true.
Sometimes I'd try and not put it on to get used to the cold.
This van smelled not like muffins.
"Oh, I liked the smell in that van."
- It smelled awful.
- It smelled like home.
Like sad...
It smelled like home when someone vomits in your living room and pees all over your carpet.
Sometimes there would be phantom wet spots on there.
Yeah.
"Well, there'd be, like, just a Coke can."
"Like, a renegade Coke can just standing there."
Was that you?
Just laying down your:
Staking your territory?
"It's behind us now, we can talk about it."
"Ari, you're the cutest..."
Everyone I talked to says that you just steal everything and that you are just the best drunk anyone's ever seen.
"And that you are gorgeous and luminous, which is all true."
- I look like a man.
- A lot of extras.
"If you say that one more time, I'm gonna slap you across that face hard."
Do it.
There's no time like the commentary.
"Rafi and I were talking, like, kind of inappropriately."
We didn't realize everyone was wearing their headphones between takes.
"Wasn't there a funny thing, when you first shot that scene that Pete didn't specifically say, like, don't lift up Kat's shirt."
"Oh, my God."
I'd like to come and interview you.
- I'm photogenic.
"- Oh, you're photogenic, okay."
Let's see if anybody's home.
Just calling for you.
"Oh, that was kind of you."
"No camera, please."
- No camera?
- No camera.
"No, I understand."
"I know you were skeptical, so I wanted to show you my birth certificate, which, um, you know..."
My bris certificate?
I don't have that.
What do they do?
"That's okay, I understand."
"Not that I'm proud of being... but I'm trying... '74, right, and you..."
"the two of you were there at his funeral, right?"
"But people in the family really didn't know that he was an internationally known architect, did they?"
"Does that mean no money to show for it, you mean, or what?"
Why did they think that he traveled the world and he didn't amount to anything?
I grew up not knowing anything about Lou's family and the Jewish half of my background.
"I'd hoped so much that Kramer would fill in that part of the story for me, but I was disappointed."
"In this society, how you made it is now like the dust has cleared."
"Something else was happening, though."
Details about my father were coming back to me:
"his voice, the rough feel of his scars."
That was one of my favorite stories.
I made him tell it to me over and over.
He was three years old back in Estonia.
There were coals glowing in a stove.
He was captivated by the light.
He took the coals out and put them in his apron.
That's what we're trying to find out.
Maybe you can help.
"The only thing they have in common, other than being gifted, is an application to this school."
"As admissions director, you see every application."
You don't think I had something to do with this.
Just want to know how the admission process works.
I'm sure privacy is a major concern here.
Who has access to the applications?
I see them all.
Then I divide them into four groups.
So there's four admissions officers and two assistants.
That's seven of us.
No one else is permitted access.
We'll need to talk to them.
I'm gonna give you a list of dates.
I need you to tell me where you were when... [police radio chatter]
[Car doors close]
Is there a problem?
[Police radio chatter]
I need to speak to you for a moment.
What?
I kept my mouth shut.
More agents.
I called for a warrant before we left my house.
I'd rather not explain that you're... not FBI.
Yeah.
[Elevator bell dings]
"Here's the warrant for you, sir."
"All right, we are looking for anything to do with high IQs, exceptional talents, anyone who is gifted."
Let's go.
These are Duval Pritchard's last four cases.
"He's doing good work, but it's as if something is left out of these reports, something he's hiding."
I'll do it first thing.
"I might order a couple, before they all get requisitioned by the army."
No need to rub it in.
- Not meaning to.
Just pleased on an ongoing basis.
You're back early.
We were thrown out of the cinema.
"This old chap was constantly sneezing, disturbing everyone, so Laura had a quiet word."
"I politely suggested that if he was so unwell, the cinema wasn't the best place for him."
Sound medical advice.
Good for you.
"He spluttered off to the manager, who threw us out."
"I told him that if we did go to war,"
I hoped the first German bomb on England would land on his cinema.
That's a terrible thing to have said.
- Not with anyone in it!
So you're banned from the cinema now?
- For life!
Come on.
- I'm starving.
Aren't you pleased to be able to stay at home to see those two banned from every cinema in Cheshire?
What every father dreams of.
How is it?
We need to keep the arm in this position for a couple of days.
"After that, you can take the sling off, but you must look after it until the pain has completely gone."
She's lucky it's not broken.
"- ""She""?"
I'm not one of the bloody cows.
My apologies.
- Dad?
Bad enough Stan being in two minds whether to call out you or the vet.
"No point in telling you to take a few days off work, I suppose?"
I thought he was a lightweight.
What do you mean?
"Well, there's just not a lot of depth there."
"Boy, that's funny, because I like him."
He's a good teacher.
I can see why he's a hit with the kids.
"I mean, he's a nice-Iooking guy, he's easygoing."
"He does that boyish smile thing too much, but that must work for him."
What's that thing about judging a book by its cover?
Sometimes you can get a pretty good idea what's inside based on the cover.
"- You know, he's published."
- Online journals aren't published.
Published is ink and paper.
"Well, you were with him like, what, half an hour?"
I'm in his class every day.
"Well, every English department has one full of charm and promise."
It's...
"Look, I understand that you and your mother see more of him than I do."
Perhaps that's why I have a clearer perspective.
What's Mom have to do with this?
"Well, she's not immune to that kind of charm."
This book-signing thing he's taking her to?
That's not just Mom.
Half of the teachers in the department are going.
Oh.
"Listen, when Mike gets home, we'll pick a place for dinner."
Three thousand dollars?
"Three thousand, two hundred seventy-five."
It's funny.
"You don't have expectations, and then you end up having expectations."
The family myth was that aunt Esther had a lot of cash socked away somewhere.
"A lot more than 3,000."
[indistinct haggling] does it matter that you're not in love with him?
"- you said it -- cash, tax."
"- okay, next."
- is that all you got to say?
- she is a grown woman.
she's not a child.
"timmy, on the other hand, is your child."
- but she is my sister.
- i know you don't unders-  oh!
i don't what?
i don't understand?
"i have siblings, too, but they're adults, and they can take care of themselves."
"- well, maybe you're right."
- she has to fail.
she has to learn to fail.
- i can't believe she's getting to him.
- but christmas will not be the same without them!
"- no, it won't. no, it won't."
we won't have to watch a picnic full of people eating roast beef and gravy with their fingers and then taking the bottom of their shirts and wiping their mouths.
"and then to top it all off, the burping and the farting that happens -- it makes the dog walk away, it's so disgusting!"
"- okay, okay."
last year was pretty bad -- i admit it.
"- yes, it was pretty bad."
it was a white trash christmas.
"i hate saying that, but it was a white trash christmas, and i am not having that again this year."
"- okay, so you're saying you're not gonna have them here?"
"- i am saying that, bob."
i am saying that.
look at this. huh?
- ugh.
- that is a symbol of status and achievement and class -- something your sister will never know anything about.
and if she was smart -- and we know she's not -- she would take that stupid hammered gold record and sell it and sign the beauty shop over to us.
How?
I want to get into the CTU's subnetwork to find out who accessed the rangers' files.
"To do that, I need your director's override."
My override?
"Once I identify the leak, I can track them back to the people behind this."
"Keith, killing the rangers is only the beginning."
These people are planning attacks against this country.
"I have no way of verifying what you're telling me, but, what?"
I'm supposed to give you unfettered access to the system?
Why would I make all this up?
Do you really think I want to be doing this?
"I'm supposed to be with my husband, Keith, helping him with his campaign."
Now give me the damned override
So I can get you out of here and get back to my life.
The override key is in the personal safe behind my desk.
The code is 206-207.
Thank you.
- Ben!
- Whoa!
"Look, I'm not gonna hurt you."
"The man who gave you this jacket, did you see which way he went?"
"Where'd you serve, man?"
"I was in Afghanistan, Yemen."
75th infantry.
"""Rangers lead the way."""
That's right.
"The man you're looking for ran toward that fence, near the railroad tracks."
"Thank you, thank you."
"Mullin's override got me into the subsystem, but I still need to parse the locks."
"Andy,"
Will you be able to find the leak or not?
"Yes, but I don't know how long it'll take."
What?
Well so far all you've given me is she could be having bloody lunch with her bank manager.
"Anyway I'd rather see the real thing, this is a photocopy."
I know but that's what was in her bag.
That's interesting.
"James Barr, what do you think of him?"
"Oh, I don't know,"
Father Sullivan's a bit concerned but.
"This is dead as far as DI Moore is concerned, isn't it?"
I think I'll keep it.
"Jack, if I were you I'd stay out of this."
"Well thank goodness you're not me, George."
Just take it easy.
Yeah I think I will.
"I think in fact, I'll take it very easy tomorrow."
I might go for a drive in the country.
"Stop off somewhere you know, have a spot of lunch."
"I hope everything was satisfactory, sir."
Very nice.
The waitress told me you were asking for some information about guests who have stayed here.
I have to say that we are not in the habit of discussing our guests with all and sundry.
The Bedford Arms has a reputation as one of the best...
Yes well most hotels I know who rent rooms by the afternoon have a reputation as a knocking shop.
I'm a policeman.
Sit down.
Perhaps we could um...
"Perhaps we could take a walk, or..."
"Yes, just as you like."
"If someone books a room for the night, and checks out early, it's hardly my business."
There are emergencies.
"Mr. Ragdale, and Jeanette Barr's been coming here over a period of months with a man she was having an affair with."
"They left at six o'clock every evening, now what do you call that, a predictable emergency?"
"A little bit heavy, I agree."
"But, anyway, she hated it."
Hated me for making her wear it.
"And then, you see, Michelangelo, models, they hate this or that."
"Ultimately, they hate each other."
Like all women do.
"So what do I do now, you might ask."
"Well, first, I wait for Forensics to come back to me about the line of fire, complicated by the mother of all wigs, apparently, and then I look for motive."
I've been talking to people.
I've been asking questions.
Lots of questions.
"From what they's been saying to me, seems everybody loved everybody here."
"""My best friend Dorothy this, my best friend Bonnie that."""
These fashion folk doth protest too much.
For praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear.
"Between you and me I'm a little nervous, because you know what they say, these things happen in threes."
And I'm damned if I'm gonna be the third.
"Minx, stay on top!"
Yesterday...
Was it yesterday?
I was trying to explain to you my views on fashion and morality.
I do feel my views have been vindicated.
Forget beauty.
Forget creation.
Look at the human race.
What do you see?
Look honestly.
Not a species of creatives.
"Humans are, quite simply, the greatest destroyers of all time."
Rape and pillage is the norm.
And not just of each other but of the planet.
You'll be lucky if there is a planet when you reach my age.
What makes you think that?
"- Ah, that."
"- Yeah, that."
"I'm 28 years old, Natalie."
I got a lot of good years ahead of me.
I'm not going to waste them away in some prison.
"- Yeah, but..."
"- Yeah, but what?"
While you're out getting married and taking vacations... and having barbecues in the backyard... and getting all excited about your kid's first tooth...
I'll be in a concrete cell surrounded by murderers and rapists... large hairy-backed men who think I have a real cute ass.
"I am sorry, but it's just not my style."
There's got to be something you can do.
"I mean, if the blood test proves it, why can't you just stand up in court and scream it?"
This is your life we're talking about.
They've got all these little rules and precedents... and procedures and legal loopholes... and all these fancy words and books... all this crap that's more important than a human being.
- So that's it?
"- Just about, yeah."
- When were you sentenced?
- Yesterday.
- So that's why you ran?
- Yep.
- And that's why you stole the car.
- Yep.
And that's why you freaked out when you saw the cops and grabbed me?
"You're catching on fast, kid."
I don't blame you.
"I do not know why, but..."
"- I believe you, Jack."
- Thanks.
That means a lot to me.
And so to be able to almost bust someone before they do the crime... you have to be somewhat telepathic.
So that's why I see myself as almost a prophet.
I don't care.
I called the police.
I had no idea the FBI would be involved.
"Well, the locals asked us to help."
"You know, chances are with a collection this valuable, it'll end up across state lines."
[sighs]
I can't believe this.
We just opened last night.
"Leo, you're not looking at this right."
It's a woman lamenting the fate of her child.
It's tragic.
"No, Dozer, you're not getting it."
It's a mother experiencing the joy of being a parent in the face of danger.
It's uplifting.
It's evidence.
It's a photo of evidence.
"Now, if only we knew where it and the rest of Gus Walker's stolen art was."
"So what's next, movie or your place?"
How about my place?
Thank you.
"Think you could, uh, carry me there?"
"Are you kidding, I can easily carry an extra hundred and... two pounds on my back."
"110, but nice save."
What if you hadn't come into Higher Ground for coffee last week?
You'd be walking all alone right now.
"What if you hadn't given me a free coffee, 'cause you dumped an entire tray of iced tea on my lap?"
So do we get any more beverage-spilling opportunities any time soon?
I don't know about the next few days.
"My grandfather's coming to town, so he can celebrate his birthday with me and my sister."
That's so cute.
Not high on my list of words I use to describe my grandfather.
He's an international corporate lawyer.
I was supposed to see a guy and think they were twins.
"And about a day before, you, Peter, came over and said that you couldn't decide how to shoot it so we weren't gonna do that scene but we had Kevin Corrigan and what do we wanna do."
"And I have a thing with turkey sandwiches so we talked about it and we talked to Kevin who in a really, like, intense way decided that he wasn't gonna say anything during the scene."
"Yeah, that's kind of..."
Turning the scene on its head.
- Last minute.
- Hilarious.
"I was like, ""Oh, my God."
He's not gonna say anything.
"What am I gonna do?"""
"- Oh, Ari."
- I'm sure everyone was freaking out because it was so late and there was no script.
I was just babbling about a turkey sandwich for like hours.
I would love to see Kevin Corrigan get some kind of award for this scene.
He's so genius.
His face...
I wish...
I wish at some point in the DVD you can put a thing of him flipping his hat over.
"Remember, when he would like do this huge body twitch and his whole hat would flip?"
"Oh, my God."
"Ari, you..."
You two.
I'd love to see it in the movie with these characters.
I think the two of us should write something.
Caroline and Silent Guy's Infinite Evening.
"Ari, this right here, when you almost throw up a few times I don't know how you freaking do it, but it's so disgusting and so accurate."
How do you...?
How do you...?
How do you make a noise every time?
- How do you?
- I don't know.
- It's one of those hidden talents.
"Come on, let's go in."
♪ It was a kind so-so love
♪ But I'm gonna make sure It never happens again
"♪ You and I, it has to be The standing joke of the year. ♪"
Is this a wake?
No.
He needs to be in the ground for it to be a wake.
This is a celebration.
- Do you see Kevin Grey?
- No.
But I've seen enough.
Let's bring her in for questioning.
"Long time, Harry."
"Yes, it is, sir."
You're about to question a suspect in the Freddie Lau murder.
You don't mind if I watch as you interview them?
"No, I don't suppose I will."
"I never expected to find you still here, Harry."
"Forgive if I'm confused, but when we ran into you last night you were having quite the party."
The Chinese attitude to grief is very different.
"Death is part of the wheel of rebirth, the way to enlightenment."
So singing '80s classics is your expression of grief?
Can I remind you my client has come here of her own free will to help with your inquiry?
You're absolutely right and we're very grateful.
"So, Miss Lau, being so close to your father, you would know about his dispute with Kevin Grey?"
"- You do know Kevin Grey, don't you?"
- Of course I do.
He used to work for my father and now he works for me but I'm not aware of any dispute between them.
"In fact, it was my father who recommended Grey to me."
We were told they'd fallen out over a stripper called Kayleigh Fenchurch.
- What?
- Her body was found the day before your dad died.
This is our control room.
"Oh, my God, this is cool."
"Wow, this takes the cake, dude."
This is the one.
Thought you would enjoy it.
"Oh, my God!"
Butch is gonna freak out.
Wow.
Is that your dad?
"- Yeah, that's..."
- No way.
"Yeah, looking down on us."
Uh-oh.
Better do something good.
So how did your dad start Preservation Hall?
He had played tuba.
He went to military high school on a tuba scholarship.
"But, you know, in college he was a business major and, you know, didn't really think of himself as..."
Definitely was not a jazz tuba player.
He was a marching band tuba player.
And when he got to New Orleans they discovered this whole tradition of marching bands.
"What we have here is called ""jazz funerals."""
"You know, the first part of the ceremony is slow dirge music."
Back in the day it was more like marching bands.
They were real uniform and polished.
"We're talking before integration here, when the black cemeteries was way out of town."
They'd play solemn music.
"When they ""cut the body loose,"" as they called it, and turned back around, the band would crank up."
Got to take that long walk back.
It certainly is hipper to dance and strut back than it would be to walk back.
"The brass band that was playing in front would be considered the ""first line."""
"But then that ""second line"" of people are the people who heard the drums."
By the name on the envelope.
Nothing of men!
What a shame!
Ok!
This comes from a woman from Turin.
"I am an admirer of you and wish to tell you of an experience,... which might interest you."
"I am Francesca, 28 years old and... married to Paolo, seven years older than me."
It all started like a game of chance.
"One night, whilst we made love,... my husband whispered in my ear."
"""My dear, would you like to do it with someone else?"""
"I felt offended, but on the inside my blood was boiling."
"The idea of being unfaithful plunged me into a state, of a great sexual arousal."
You have never seen anythink like it.
Leave me at peace.
-Who can think of things like that?
"-Stop it, paolo."
This is nothing but a fantasy of yours.
It is not my desire.
"But soon, the fantasies became insufficient."
"So to prove that he had doubled my pleasure,..."
"I accepted, a little reluctantly, to go to a place where my husband... said, we would experience a different kind of evening."
What knickers are you wearing?
The one you bought in Paris.
You might be in for a surprise.
I've got the one to please.
"You can insist for me to look sexy, but I repeat to you,... that I do not intend to do anything."
As you wish my dear.
Nobody forces you.
Each of us is free to behave as we want to.
You are wet.
"It was true, my body had betrayed me."
"Outside, I felt disgusted with my husband,... but I was really atrracted by it like flies to the honey."
Masterson Construction's pissed about this prison case.
Still?
You handed it off like they asked.
"No, they wanted the thing gone, not handed off, and now it's turned into a class action, and it's going to trial tomorrow."
"Listen to me, it's not your job to make this thing go away."
"Harvey, I'm their attorney."
"They had a problem, they wanted it fixed, and I didn't fix it."
"Bullshit, you got Pearson Specter to drop it like a hot potato."
That's all you could've done.
"No, what I could have done was kill the whole damn thing."
"And since I didn't, they found some inmate at another prison to break the case wide open, which is why I just had to eat a ton of shit."
- What did you just say?
"- I said they found a witness at another prison, and now I'm gonna lost my goddamn client."
Where you going?
"Like I said, I need to find Donna."
♪♪
"I want to know right now, do you know where Mike is?"
"- No, I don't."
"- You don't know where, or you don't know what case he's working on?"
"I don't know either one, but if you calm down, then maybe I can help you find him."
"No, Rachel, I don't want help finding him"
"In fact, I don't want you telling him"
I was looking for him at all.
♪♪
- Oscar Reyes?
- Yes.
My name is Harvey Specter.
It's come to my attention that you're filing a class-action lawsuit.
We are.
How can I help you?
Our pro bono work means a lot to us.
"We take it very seriously, and I have a very difficult question to ask you."
That's the only way we can survive in competition with her.
Be prepared to hire more people.
Yes.
What brings you here at this late hour?
I must go to Chunghae.
But you said you'd be staying in Mujinju for a while.
Has anything come up?
"Grand Chief Jang has attacked the pirates' base, and taken the life of Yi Do-hyung."
I must go to Chunghae as soon as possible.
I will join you.
Right will prevail in the end.
You reap what you sow...
It is so true.
I knew this was the end that awaited Yi Do-hyung.
I must rush the building of an inn at the harbor now that we are about to suppress the pirates.
I will also hire Chinese and Japanese interpreters.
I will throw a banquet to celebrate your victory.
The reason we could easily defeat their base was because Yum Moon was away with his elite force.
"While we were attacking their base,"
"Yum Moon breached our blockade, and attacked Buryung to secure food and weapons."
We don't know when he will attack again.
We can't let our guard down.
"We should attack them now, and not give them time to regroup."
"Just as Grand Chief Jang expected,"
Yum Moon must have gone berserk after seeing Master Yi's corpse.
We can attack at our leisure when he retaliates in haste.
- Grand Chief.
- What is it?
We have received word of the regent's return to Chunghae.
"It has been a long time, my lord."
"Yes, it has."
I heard that you have killed Yi Do-hyung.
It's so pretty!
This one is totally pretty too.
Wow.
Yay!
"Woah, hey, hey."
It's totally cool.
"Oh, no!"
What's wrong with that one?
I knew that would happen.

Who is it?
Don't be afraid and come on out.
"It was a fated bond that should not have been made, but since it has already been made that fated bond will definitely continue."
They will meet again.
"So you're saying their two fates will continue to be connected, so if I just keep following the town head,"
I may be able to catch her again.
"You told me not to be afraid, but actually are you not the one who is afraid?"
Can you speak?
There's no reason that a mermaid can't do what a human can.
Then why did you not say a word that day?
I did except that it wasn't heard.
Today is a happy occasion celebrating the newly appointed town head.
I thought to prepare for all of you a rare spectacle.
Please save me.
Mermaids can hear each others' minds so there's no reason to speak.
Then can humans not hear the minds of mermaids?
A long time ago a boy loved a mermaid and heard a mermaid's voice.
And what happened to the boy who loved the mermaid?
Can we meet again?
If wish lanterns float above the sea
I will take it as a signal that we're to meet again.
Are you watching him closely?
Stand with me.
And we shall rise together.
I will not turn from my wife.
"You really did not want this life, did you?"
"Well, whatever one you find in this world,"
I pray it brings you peace.
Father.
A memento.
Of days past.
I could not do it.
Sit beside me.
I had the instrument in hand.
His back was turned.
"One simple motion, and our troubles forever removed."
"But when the moment came, he spoke to me with affection, giving voice to sentiment."
I was wrong to push you to such thoughts against him.
Some actions carry too steep a price.
"Even in refraining, the ground beneath us pitches."
"Tomorrow, we must prepare to leave this house."
You've given your answer?
The only one my tongue could ever speak.
You honour me.
"I attempt to gain the sun, only to plunge into the depths, while Tullius rides with Apollo, bribing his way with an amphora of mulsum and promises to the air."
It does not matter.
"We must leave this house, with nothing but our clothes, a few possessions."
Not even a slave to attend us.
We have lost everything.
Not everything.
The men have fought with passion and honour.
A testament to your work as Doctore.
I but carry torch lit by more deserving predecessor.
He'd have been proud.
"If physical appearance doesn't matter, then what's wrong with THIS appearance?"
I happen to like the way I look.
And I'm sorry if it upsets your mathematical equation.
"""Handsome, frightened man marries unattractive, desperate woman."""
- Is that how the ad read?
"- No, no."
It's simply that I was expecting someone ELSE.
I...
I...
"I'm sorry, I don't know what to say, I guess I'll just have to get used to it."
No you don't... you don't have to get used to anything.
- Wha... what do you mean?
"- Gregory, I don't want to continue."
I...
I...
I...
I don't understand.
I...
I really want to apologize.
I... settled for something that I didn't want.
"I thought I could live with that, I thought that it would be enough, but..."
"I lied, I lied to myself, I lied to you."
"To tell you the truth, I think your theories about relationships are total bullshit."
"I believe in love and lust and sex and romance,"
I don't want everything to add up to some perfect equation.
"I want mess and chaos, I want someone to go crazy out of his brain for me."
I want to feel passion and heat and sweat and madness!
I want Valentines and cupids and all the rest of that crap!
"I want it all, and I want to thank you."
"I want to thank you, Greg, because you FORCED me to look at things that I was TOO lazy or too SCARED to look at."
"I mean, can you imagine, all this time I..."
I kept up this ridiculous fantasy that
If that's the case... then your husband may recover some use of his arms and his legs.
"But in this type of accident, we are very worried... the damage may be permanent."
Permanent?
"Oh, my God."
I'm so sorry to tell you this.
Wait a minute.
You...
Compressed is better than broken or fractured.
Am I correct?
If the spine is only compressed... then he may recover some limited use of his arms and his legs.
What are the chances of it being a compression rather than a fracture?
Not good.
How not good?
"I don't want to discourage you with statistics, Mrs. Rickman."
Statistics are for groups.
"Your husband is one talented, driven man."
His chances are 100%... or zero.
And we have to be ready for the zero.
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?
You're so sorry?
Why do you keep saying that?
Because there's nothing else.
The chances that your husband will wake up and be the same old Peter are small.
"And the chances that he will walk again, or paint, are also small."
"Although, of course, we're hopeful."
"The chances that he will be his old self, and walk... infinitesimal."
I am still so sorry to tell you these things.
I'm all right.
We can afford the best possible treatment... that money can buy... but we would be glad if...
I would be glad if you would stick by him... at least to begin with.
Thank you.
- Scared?
- What did he die of?
- Heart attack.
- He did?
That's a real sad story that you didn't know your dad at all.
"I have a kid who's 18 years old, and I didn't get to see him from the time he was 8."
"So it's kind of a different story, isn't it?"
Or is that the same story?
"It's a different story, because... well, if I had died,"
"I guess it would have been the same story, huh?"
Why hadn't you seen him for ten years?
"Oh, it was a custody case."
- Did you want to keep him?
- Sure.
My kid.
My son.
"I mean, I don't just feel sympathy for you."
I feel sympathy for Lou.
- Why?
- 'Cause you were his son.
A man has feelings for his son.
I know there must have been some kind of social convention that somehow kept you apart.
And I don't want to make excuses for that social convention.
"Whatever it was, out with it..."
I mean down with it.
That's bad.
"Whatever it was, it was bad."
It's just sad.
"How accidental our existences are, really, and how full of influence by circumstance."
I wonder if I'll ever find out exactly what happened that night in Penn Station.
"For years, I thought maybe my father hadn't really died, that he was out there somewhere living a parallel life."
"I suppose that was because he left no physical evidence that he'd ever been in our house, not even a bow tie hanging in the closet."
Use as much as you have to.
Our reserves are at less than 60%--
I'm not going to let any more of them die.
"To get that reactor running again, we're going to have to use a third... of our antimatter reserves."
REED:
Why so much?
Every system on that ship is integrated.
The only way to bring bio-support back online is to power up the whole thing.
That's not going to leave much antimatter for our torpedoes... never mind our engines.
Did you inform the Captain?
I wanted to run it by both of you first.
I never imagined Captain Archer would put the welfare of a few Xindi... before his own people.
Do you know he's spent nearly two days in that hatchery?
"From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped working long enough to even sleep."
"From what I'm told, he hasn't stopped working long enough to even sleep."
Delay the transfer for now.
The Captain gave us an order.
I'll speak with him.
[Serious instrumental music]
Where's Trip?
ARCHER:
Did you bring the antimatter?
T'POL:
No.
What's the problem?
Initialising their reactor will deplete our reserves by one-third.
We can spare it.
ARCHER:
We're only a few light-years from the red giant.
We'll still have more than enough fuel to get there.
We don't know for certain if the weapon is in that system.
There are lives at risk here.

Your Commissioner won't come and save you.

No-one's going to press charges.

They're going to get away with what they done.
You know I'm gutted Dale Roach is unfit to face prosecution.
"But, listen, Joe, we're looking into the complaints made by you or Danny or any of the other lads to the police about the abuse you were made to suffer by staff and visitors."
Any police that came... .. they just talked to the staff.
"They were the bastards who were organising it in the first place... .. and anyone who talked about it, they just got it ten times worse."
"We're doing everything we can, but we still need your help, Joe."
We're particularly interested in this man.
"Now, you identified him as a football coach."
His name's Ronan Murphy.
"Did you, or anyone you know, ever make a complaint about him?"
"Yeah, there was one time."

We did nothing.
"Yeah, absolutely."
I thought there was an other candidate.
That would be me.
How is your shoulder?
Much better.
We'll talk later.
Alright.
"Dad, you know we might be moving out"
"Hang on just a bit, love."
Daddy's doing some business work.

"Well, let's not get ahead ourselves."
Mum's not got the job just yet.
"No one's getting ahead of themselves,"

"And Mary, same question to you."
"Well, Karen, if a member of staff does right by me, they get smiley Mary."

You were sailing to South Africa and I was getting better.
"I kept thinking about us,"
about when we were going to see each other again.
telling to myself that I was fighting for both of us.
"And then somebody had to tell me that you never got to your ship,"
"that it was you, the guy on the highway who was in the crash and that the new heart beating now in my chest, it was your's."
I'd prepared myself to the idea that to live someone had to die.
That it wouldn't be fair.
I used to tell to myself that this person will still living in some way thanks to me.
That's exactly what happened.
"Yes but, you are here, and you're not, and I talk to you, and I can't touch you."
"Of course you can, I'm right here."
And you know Simon...

"Alright,"
I'm going back in for a swim.
Are you coming ?
"Are you sure, you don't want to come ?"

You nerver want to and then when you get in you love it.
I'll join you.
"In 2010 in France, 15 613 persons were waiting for a tranplantation"
Only 4708 could have one.
"Because of the improvement of the transplantation techniques, the demand keeps increasing."
The main reason for the lack of organs is that we don't know the will of our loved ones about it.
A donor can save 4 lives.
Let's talk about it...
Go!
He's dead.
He's beautiful.
"I'm not playing house baby, you are."
You fuck him.
Get him real juicy.
Stick him in the oven then we'll fuck.
I know it always cheered you up before?
A good fuck.
Please continue about orgasm.
I have a theory.
"If all humans have in their brains some substantial process based on the opiate mechanism of action why can't they exist somewhere on the universe some other form of life which would depend on this mechanism, even more... this would attract the alien to heroin."
Well according to you to humans as well during orgasm.
"Well,"
"Well, doesn't that mean that orgasms are dangerous?"
Yo!
It's Jimmy!
So looks like he found some money for some stuff.
or something
I forgot.
"I mean, I forgot the time."
I'm not ready.
"Don't worry about it, that's what their job is, they gonna fix you beautifully."
Don't move...
"I love it, the chicken is great,"
Let me get a shot at him.
What are you doing?
You can't go around snapping pictures at people when they're not ready!
"Calm down darling, I've got some cocaine for you."
And I don't want any bakery.
We're gonna have a marvelous time.
"Margaret this is Nelly, she's the fashionary from Midnight Magazine."
"She has longer legs than yours, hasn't she Margaret?"
What is it again?
his time  we felt musically stronger.
But at the same time  that pressure's back on you know ill we match the second one
We're about to take me home.
I'm naked recording.
smells like man in here.
smells like a mixture of boy and man.
f you could imagine yourself being taken away at 1 6 or 1 7 years of age and then thrown  into the spotlight.
We're incredibly excited to announce that we are gonna be doing a worldwide stadium tour in 201 4.
People are constantly around them.
And to hold their nerve and cool and enjoy it and perform  it's a big big ask.
"Zayn's recording all night tonight, then it's you and Louis tomorrow."
"here's definitely times where you're not, Iike..."
But then you kind of just have to step back for lik e a second and try and weigh out the pros and the cons.
t's lik e-- t's a no-brainer.
I don't wanna do anything else.
f you actually sit and think about it we've done some amazing things.
But to be honest with you 'm still trying to live a normal life.
hat's exactly what we are.
e're just normal  1 9 20 21-year-olds you know just going out and mess about lik e any other guy at university or whatever.
We're not doing anything different.
That's what I mean by us being normal.
Our jobs just happen to be abnormal.
Bedtime for me.
Bedtime for me.
"don't lik e people saying ""You're famous. """
just struggle with the word.
t just gives you lik e no substance.
"It's not Iike, "" He was a really nice guy""  or, "" He was really funny."""
"It becomes this thing where it's like, "" He's famous."" And it's just a weird...."
I hate it.
worry about meeting somebody who's truthfuI and is 1 00 percent just there because of me.
I knew she would pull something like this.
She can't stand the fact that I'm the one getting all the attention today.
We should've had her committed when she turned 60.
"Claire, you can't have someone committed for excessive vanity."
"Thank you, Rose."
How wonderful to have two compassionate daughters.
I thought you were going to wear make-up today.
- I am wearing make-up.
- Well?
"Oh, my God."
What the hell are you wearing?
This happens to be an imitation Scaasi.
"You're the mother of the bride, not the opening act."
"Fine, I'll go home and change."
"Oh, stop it."
We're late already.
The priest is sweating.
"All celibates sweat, dear."
"If they didn't, they'd explode."
"Come on, let's go."
I just went to buy myself a little snack.
"I can't sit through this without eating something, I'll pass out."
- It'll only take 45 minutes.
- It'll feel like two hours.
Not to mention that you're marrying outside your faith and on the Sabbath...
"Mother, the only thing you ever taught me about the Sabbath is that Bergdorf's wouldn't be as crowded."
"And you listen to me,"
"I want you to get up there, and I want you to remember today is my day."
"And if you don't behave yourself,"
I'm gonna have your birth certificate blown up as a Christmas card.
I should have never encouraged you to speak.
Maybe she'll look back and turn into a pillar of salt.
Chew this.
It'll calm you.
I know what would really calm me.
Just chew.
"Contrary to what people believe, gunpowder does not explode."
"It burns very quickly, producing a high volume of gasses."
"Crusoe, in order for me to help you, I must maintain my will to live."
"Confine these gases within a rigid container, and the container will burst in a spectacular fashion."
This is what causes your explosion.
A man of science would appreciate that.
The spirits would say:
"""Make sure it makes a bang""."
You stick with your spirits and I'll stick with mine.
"Ah, they are the same."
"- No, they're not."
"- Yes, they are."
I have heard you pray for help from a dead man.
That dead man would be the son of my god.
- Is he not dead?
- No.
And he's certain not found in bones and relics.
Unlike your saints and martyrs.
All right.
"Now, those are similar."
- The same.
- Similar.
"Give them your faith, and they will give you their protection."
"Dost thou, jeremiah blackthorn, in the name of this child, renounce the devil and all his works, the vain, pomp and glory of the world, and the cardinal desires of the flesh, so that thou wilt not follow nor be led by them."
********
"And if faith is not enough, have powerful friends."
Nolan!
Nolan.
"We would've called, but by the time I knew, Vivian was already on the bus."
Lily was very tenacious.
She tried to get me to come home in six consecutive stops.
She insisted on coming all this way just to ask why you stopped delivering pies.
I'm really flaky.
- That's what I told her.
"It's not about the pies although the pies were always lovely, and so vivid."
"I gotta go get somebody's, uh, something."
Get under there.
They're here because you stopped delivering their pies.
"All this time, I've been making pies..."
"And dosing them with what you claim is vanilla, but that ain't vanilla."
I'm gonna dose the both of y'all with shut-the-fudge-up.
The weight of kept secrets had become unbearable  for the pint-sized pie-slinger.
Why don't we talk?
I thought you were my friend.
"- Like I said, flaky."
- I got something to say.
I'm gonna say it to you and you and you and your hump.
Olive wanted to let loose the secrets and lies  she'd been force-fed by her friends:
"That Chuck was still alive  that Lily was her mother  but instead, what came out was this:"
What's gotten into you?
I am a sawed-off shotgun full of secrets.
- Did she say she was armed?
"- No, I don't have a gun."
I am a gun.
"At any moment, truth buckshot could come spewing out of my muzzle."
Look out.
That's enough.
Truer words were never spoken.
This rifle is gonna go away in a little satin-lined case with the trigger locked and the safety on.
I quit.
How many men did he take with him?
"I don't know the exact number, but there must be dozens."
Yum Moon must have gone to attack Buryung.
I guess innocent lives will be lost.
What will you do?
It's too late to go to Buryung.
We will wait here and attack when night falls.
- Now is the time.
"- Yes, sir."
Is anyone there?
This must have been the reason for my troubled dream last night.
Did you hold a nice funeral for Master Sul?
I am deeply sorry for his death.
Do not insult his name with your despicable mouth.
"Grand Chief Jang,"
"I have no regrets, even if I were to die now."
But if there is one thing...
It is that we are bound by an evil fate.
"If we had met under better circumstances,"
I'd have liked to use your talents to accomplish a grand enterprise.
I'm not saying this in order to beg for my life.
"Even now, if we join hands we could have the world."
Silence!
Many people have lost their lives and were taken as slaves for your ridiculous dreams.
"Even if I could gain the world by removing their grudges, it would be meaningless."
Do you know why I became a pirate?
"Born a common man, there was nothing I could do in Shilla."
The only way I could rise above my station in life was with a sword.
You were also born a slave.
Then you must understand what I mean.
"Since you hold my life in your hands,"
I will ask you again.
I'm not gonna send you to school in the morning all hungover and shit.
"You know, you're already playing catch up as it is, dame."
"And, um, do you want to come?"
Are you--are you asking me out on a date?
- I should buy you a drink.
- We're opening our bar tonight.
"- Well, I'll see you later."
- Ok.
- Bye.
- Bye bye.
What you're telling me as my best friend is that not in a million years would this girl ever think about
"- taking me to bed, right?"
- Never.Never!
"- The reptilian, repugnant creature that I am."
"- Your words, your words."
I have been a goddamn fool.
"Because all these years, tom, i thought that we were friends, and we're not."
You don't have to worry about teddy anymore.
You know how he was banged up after your father died.
Right.
He's running around volunteering at every single V.A.Hospital there is.
It's not right when the man in the relationship knows less in the sack than his lady does.
I gotta get out of this.
"Yeah, well, what are you gonna do about the father?"
How do I tell tommy his daughter's a slut?
By phone.From another state.
How much is it to pop the kidney out?
"Well, you're insured through the fire department, right?"
"No, see, I can't use my insurance company."
I don't want the fire department to know.
It seems that our mademoiselle doesn't really like our mr.
Gavin so much to the degree that she was willing to engage me in a good old-fashioned grudge hump.
He's most likely a hafez.
He must have done it a dozen times since he's come to this facility.
Some muslim children are able to do it since age 12.
"Two months of interrogation, that's all the CIA's been able to get out of him."
There are cuts and bruises under his right eye socket.
What kind of tactics are they using?
"I control the actions to the detainees, but I can assure you, my protest about their methods has been ignored."
Let the interrogation proceed normally.
I'm gonna interrupt and demand they stop harassing.
Maybe I should tell them in advance.
"No, it's better if they don't expect it."
"The reaction will be more visceral, more believable."
- Go ahead with phase 2 as planned.
- Copy that.
You really gonna put a show on for these guys?
"No, no for them."
For Jind Allah.
He's needs to see me as a complete contrast to what he's come to expect from his captors.
It's the best way to jump start him into talking.
We have less than 36 hours.
Have at it.
You two ready?
"- Yeah, this way."
- Thank you.
Do you understand?
Every day... who the hell are you?
Supervisory special agent Jason Gideon.
I'm an FBI behavioral analyst.
It's time to show this man some respect.
You gotta be kidding me.
You have orders from agent Bingaman to leave so I can speak with this detainee alone.
I'm sorry for the treatment you've suffered.
I thought you were talking about how your father had to go back to the city.
"- Yeah, I thought so too."
"- Well, I wasn't."
"You didn't make that clear, sweetheart."
I can't process how grossly dissatisfied I find myself feeling.
"Things I've coveted for years are mine now, and all I feel is miserable."
(CHUCKLES) That is so cliché.
"But you know that, so I won't bother reminding you of how silly you sound."
"Didn't you say you, erm..."
you placed on some silly list of young so-and-so's?
35 under 35.
That's it.
Yeah.
"Yeah, we didn't have crap like that when I was your age."
You're ahead of the game.
"Yeah, but when you were 32, didn't you win the National Book Award?"
That's true.
But you are not me.
How would you like to accept a gracious favour I've done for you?
Depends on what it is.
That answer is at once both arrogant and correct.
Don't accept too readily something you might want.
"In any event, a friend of mine from Lambert College got in touch."
They're looking for an adjunct creative writing instructor for the fall semester.
"I teach there occasionally, as you know, but usually more advanced seminars, so..."
"I find this to be beneath me, but it's a good opportunity for you."
He'd like to interview you tomorrow.
- You can take my car.
- What does it pay?
"At that level, I have no idea."
"But, hey, you haven't got the position yet."
I've merely placed you on their radar.
Questions?
"So, to work."
I'm happy we're working together.
I'm sure we'll work wonders.
"When you have five minutes, tell your team to..."
"to stop flying solo, you will end up in trouble..."
I want that arsehole brought down.
"Mr Meynard, I'm not used to seeing you work wonders, but I am giving you another chance."
You are going to reactivate my card today.
Let me call you back.
"Miss Karlsson, it's impossible, you've been overdrawn for three months."
"Do you think 40,000 Euros will be enough?"
In cash furthermore!
It's always the same story with you.
Nothing for months and then one day...
It's called being your own boss.
Do you think you're the only one?
"If you can't find decent cases,"
- get a new job.
- I'm starting from scratch!
Do you know what that means for a criminal lawyer?
"It means looking for fees in the sewers, it means being a court-appointed lawyer for 192 euros with clients who beg you to get them out of jail and who think you're a piece of shit once they're out!"
That's what it means.
"Being a lawyer may look nice, but at the beginning it's mostly just whoring, if you'll pardon the expression."
"So, yes, I am overdrawn, yes, I am working like a dog, but you know me, I'm still standing."
So do your job and support me.
"40,000 euros in cash."
They're going to ask for an explanation.
"Well, deal with it."
Sit down.
Thank you.
Everybody in my office in five minutes.
Both of you just sat there saying nothing.
And then that old lady bowed to you and left without saying a word.
There are things we don't need words to understand.
"Her husband also died... in Nagasaki, just like Grandpa."
"That's why she comes here now and then... sits down for a while without saying a word, and leaves without saying a word."
There are people who are silent... while they are talking.
"This one, Suzukichi... the youngest brother."
He was a little weak in the head.
Ever since he lost all of his hair from the atomic bomb... he shut himself up in a room and stayed there.
But on hot summer days... it must have been insufferable for him.
"He used to slip out when the moon came up, and sneak away for a swim... in the basin of a waterfall deep in the mountains."
"That's right, yes."
That waterfall is a nice one.
You should go there sometime.
"And then, that boy, what was he doing every day in the room?"
-He just kept on drawing pictures.
-What kind of pictures?
"For some strange reason, only pictures of eyes."
-Eyes?
-Eyes like this.
"As long as there was paper... he just drew eyes, never getting tired of it."
He's spooky!
I bet those were eyes seen through an obsession.
He loathed the idea of being seen with his hairless head.
And he must have been obsessed by the eyes of people.
It must be those eyes.
This kind of drawing?
That's it!
That's exactly it.
Those are exactly the same pictures.
Come to think of it... you sure do look like Suzukichi.
You are like two peas in a pod.
What I need is... for Tom Horn to talk himself into a terrible tangle... and for you to get it down on paper.
It's no good for us just to write it down later.
You mean it has to be in his own words?
"Just like I said, Charles."
"Hello, Tom."
"Hello, Joe."
I got a letter yesterday from a fellow up in Montana.
What'd he want?
I'm not so sure this is the spot to be talking.
"Got a bottle of mescal in my office, and it's quiet."
Sure.
"You've spent some time in the hills, haven't you?"
"Most of my life, Tom."
- But the world is changing fast.
- I can see that.
And a man had better get with it.
I've been trying to work a few things out in my mind.
Staying in a hotel and being able to get a drink right away seems to help.
Think you'll ever get back in them hills again?
I don't know.
Scares me to death.
I see you're carrying a belly gun.
I've never known you to do that before.
"Well, carrying a rifle in town and all..."
I got this inquiry from Montana... for a man who could come up there and see to himself... and look to a few things that-a-way... in respect to the cattle stealing going on in the Big Moon up there in that district.
- What's required?
- Some ability with a rifle.
"You know, Joe, nobody ever offered to give me an office."
"- Make you feel kind of special, does it?"
- I don't know.
If I had your ability with a rifle... nobody would ever expect me to come in out of the field.
"As it is, I spend half my time on the railroad... handcuffed to some petty criminal, as just a delivery man."
All right.
Let's do this.
I got the hi-res on monitor two.
Tony.
Didn't know I was gonna see you today.
You know what we want.
We need to find Michael Amador before he unloads the virus.
I've already told Jack everything I know.
"Well, I want you to tell me."
"First Jack, now you."
Hmm... what does that remind me of?
You told Jack that Amador might try to contact a Marcus Alvers.
"So, where do we look for Alvers?"
That's a nice ring.
Who's the lucky girl?
"Hope you did a background check, though, 'cause you don't want to make the same mistake twice."
You're going back to prison.
There's a good chance you'll be executed as a traitor.
"Now you know if you cooperate, you may be able to save your own life, but you're stalling."
"Which means you know something and you still think there's a play you can make, only now's not the right time."
Very incisive.
I hope your wife appreciates that about you.
Why don't you tell me about Alvers?
All I know is that he works only with Amador.
I don't know him personally.
All we've been able to dig up on him are a few random medical records under one of his known aliases.
"He had an MRI on one of his knees, there's a prescription for antibiotics, treated for HIV..."
Her pulse is spiking.
Someone hasn't been using protection with Marcus Alvers.
She's probably had sex with him.
"See, Nina, my colleagues in the next room tell me that something in those medical records concerns you."
I'm guessing it's not the knee.
What did?
A spirit!
"It tried to kill me, it did, yeah."
But I'm not so easily dispatched.
Oh no!
"Where are ya, then?"
"Come on, man!"
I'm here!
And I'm ready for ya this time!
I overestimated the net.
Or underestimated the man.
A locksmith showed me this once.
He had a workshop next to my warehouse.
Why is it called a skeleton key?
Because it's thin.
I don't know.
Killing jacob moore will not have solved anything.
No?
One of his men would have taken his place.
"Well, that depends."
The leader of a mutiny has to terrify the crew more than the prospect of a hanging.
"Well, if you ask me, crusoe, I just think that-- friday, look, we're not gonna kill them all."
We'll reinstate the captain and his officers in exchange for a safe passage to englan where no one will hang.
"If they can convince a judge that they were forced to join a mutiny for fear of their lives, then no."
"Your english judges must be the wisest of men, not to be corrupted by the power they hold over the lives of men."
Except for one.
Do you believe there is a god?
Judge jeffries... do you believe in hellfire?
King james' right-hand man.
"To see him in action was to see the future, for me and every london merchant and dissenter family in the realm."
Such a villain through the whole city!
"Now, gentlemen of the jury, you take notice of the terrible carriage of this fellow."
It's all very well in theory.
I just wish I didn't get sucked in like that.
"For one moment, you know, the defences are all down."
"You think it's all going to have this nice happy ending, well, from my point of view anyway, and then...."
Life just kicks you in the teeth...every time.
"From what you would saying, this other cousin of yours, what's her name, Janice?"
Sounds like a right drip.
I suppose that was a sure sign when you think of it.
The clashing clothes of two people who really didn't get on.
"The worst of it all, he's got no idea obviously, about her and Stephen."
And now tonight we're all going off to see this play together at the Lyric.
With me just there basically to make the number up.
Still wondering whether to give it a miss.
That's supposed to be really funny from what I've heard.
"No, you should definitely go."
Get a few drinks down you.
At least have a good chuckle.
"The Daily Mail calls it ""a real, riotous rib-tickler""."
"Well, there you are, then."
"I suppose so, but I don't know."
"Whenever I go to the theatre to see a comedy,"
I seem to be the only one there who's not laughing.
She'll be here any second.

"How about a drink, hey?"
Who wants a drink?
I'll take a little something.
Can you do a mojito?
Y-yes.
You know what?
"Actually, I have, uh, some fresh...mint."
Oh.
Here you go.
"Flashbang grenades may not be deadly, but if one goes off nearby, it can cause temporary blindness and hearing loss."
The combination of those effects is enough to stun even the most hardened soldier.
"But if you can take cover in time to protect your vision, you can still stay in the fight."
"You may not be able to hear your enemy, but if you can see him well enough to pursue him, then it's just a matter of not letting the ringing in your ears distract you..."
"Hey, hey, hey!"
Back off!
Back off!
...from taking him down.
Let's try this again.
"Whatever problem you have, we will help you with, but we need to get out of the country, and you will help us."
Do you understand?
"Yes, I do."
"You guys don't get it, alright."
"I-I-I'm, like, marked for death."
How stupid are you gonna feel if you come to me for help and I wind up dead?
Just tell us about your situation.
Okay.
"A year ago, this Syrian woman comes to me -- she's married to some jerk smacking her around, and, you know, I-I kind of have a thing against that."
Oh.
"Well, he's not a complete bastard."
"I set her up with a new name, new life -- the whole deal."
"Turns out she's married to Jabbar Hamady, ex-Syrian intelligence services."
Now he's a big gun runner and has a huge problem letting go.
"The only thing I've got on the calendar, is a group trip to the outlet mall in four weeks."
What I should say is that we really got nothing to loose.
What if it gets back to dean Bowman and the administration?
- We could get seriously busted.
"- Then, I'll take the blame."
I'll step down as president.
Are you sure about that?
"I'm sure, because we're not going to get caught."
"Even if we don't get caught, it still the kts."
They're like a dealest fraternity.
And the front hall always smells like vomit.
Excuse me.
I know I was initialy sceptical but I think Casey's plan has real merit.
"I mean, think about it."
"Would you rather party with real flesh and blood kts, or read about some fake characters, in a tired, old dusty book about a bunch of crap that never happened."
Who's with me?
I am!
Let's do it!
OK then it's settled.
Let's get started.
We need a sound proof down here.
"Tom, Dave, you still have your disturbingly loud band?"
Disturbingly loud?
Why wouldn't the band still be together?
No reason.
"And one day, I'm sure you'll be hugely successful."
"Anyway, you guys need to isolate the room so no sound can make it upstairs."
"and then you'll have a room to practice, you'll become great big rock stars."
"Next, we need enough liquor to incapacitate"
David Hasselhoff so who's gonna go and hit the store with me?
That was super honorable of you to say you'd step down.
"Yeah, right?"
I'm just grateful to be able to live with you Iike this... because of him.
"Now, go on, eat."
Grandma's watermelon is real tasty.
Thank you!
Grandpa used to play this so often....
I know I got old... and so did this organ.
I'II fix it.
I sure will.
absolutely.
"You're saying ""absolutely"" again."
There were so many of them.
But they all died.
AII of them died because of the atomic bomb?
No.
"Some of them died because of that, but there were some who died young... and some who died in places far away."
"This one, Natakichi... he was my seventh or eighth brother, I think."
He left home and became a shoemaker in Nagasaki.
After five years of apprenticeship... just as he was ready to open his own shop... he made a gross mistake.
What did he do?
Big Bro' Natakichi... eIoped with the shoemaker's wife.
"Hey, why don't you go to bed?"
I'm not sleepy.
Then what happened to Natakichi?
My father was furious... and refused to let him come back home.
So Natakichi was obliged to build a small hut... far up in the mountain behind here... and make a scanty living by making shoes there.
They lived in a place... where two charred cedar trees... that had been struck by lightning... stood along the path they used in their escape.
But why live in a place like that?
while they were running away... the woman who was holding Natakichi's hand... saw those two trees... and said they looked like... they had committed a double suicide.
And that's why they built a hut at that place.
-A real weird story.
-It makes me feel eerie.
I'm going to bed.
"""Look at my poster."
Look at my leaflet.
"""Surely..."
It's ME.
"I really need you to..."""
"And Jack went up to him and said, ""All right, Dave?"""
LAUGHTER
"And then said, ""How's the court case coming on?"""
LAUGHTER
And walked away.
"Yes, I can be a right bastard."
Did you...?
Was that just off the top of your head or did you know he was going in the bank?
"I could see he was in pain and desperately trying to cash his cheque, so I spoilt it for him."
Anyway.
"But from that, you've become a hero, hailed by the fire brigade."
"Well, you know, this was a situation that I found myself in."
"You always think, ""Would I behave courageously and appropriately?"", if you were put in a situation."
"I was with my family and we were crossing a bridge near where we live, which is a railway bridge, so it's one of those bridges that's got two big iron sides to it - do you know what I mean?"
"And as we cross it, a van stopped and with smoke coming out of the bonnet."
"And the driver got out and legged it, and I could see all this smoke, and then flames were starting to come out."
"And I thought, ""That car's going to explode."""
"So I told Jane, my wife,"
"""Get the kids out, get them away, and I'm going to stop the traffic."""
"So, I stepped out into the road and just stopped all the traffic."
"And there were people being irate - ""What you doing?"""
"And I said, ""There's a car there that's about to explode, right."""
And um...
Ramped it up.
..they all stopped.
LAUGHTER
"They all stopped and the fire brigade came and they get out, they put the fire out."
We won't stand a chance!
"Slave, give me manual control."
"I'm banking on them searching outwards, not inwards."
- And if you're wrong?
"- If I'm wrong you can say, ""I told you so"", provided you speak loudly and quickly."
The entrance to the old monorail must be somewhere in this area.
Probably underneath all that rubble.
"Must be just beyond the next ridge, near where the armoury used to stand."
"Hunda, someone up there."
Cover!
It's all right.
I know them.
Right.
The raid's off.
- Why?
- We've been tricked.
Leitz is a double agent.
"If you go into that monorail, you're good as dead, but you could go in where we came out."
We'd be picked off before we got anywhere near the terminal.
"Hunda, if you issue your men with these, you'll have a fighting chance."
What are they?
Some new drug that counters the effects of their medical lasers.
They should be entering the tunnel now.
"We'll let them get well in, then blow every charge."
Make it as easy as possible for the poor devils.
"- We have an entry signal, sir, square 4K."
- Square 4K.
Must be a feint to draw attention from their main attack.
"They look to be coming through in some strength for a feint, General."
They're moving towards the terminal.
We'll cut them off on the concourse.
Tell Commissioner Sleer I'll need a full troop of guards.
"And America, 'cause we're good, we're gonna help him."
- Okay.
"- Okay, so we're all gonna vote for Trump because he's hurting, he's in pain?"
"We're actually gonna let him be our president to be nice, or kind or something?"
"- Yeah, yeah."
Like Batboy.
Remember Batboy?
We're all in on it.
- What was Batboy?
"- The kid with cancer and he wanted to be Batman, so the whole city was like, you're Batman!"
- I had this friend and she's ten years old.
"You know, she's--"
She's my neighbor.
"I mean, it's okay if I have a ten-year-old friend, right?"
"- Yeah, you can have one."
"- Anyway, I talk to her the other day and she said that she had a stomachache and so she-- she said to me, Big Boy--"
"Well, that's what she calls me, she calls me ""Big Boy."""
"She said, um, my stomach hurts so bad, I wanna--"
"I wanna pound my stomach, 'cause it-- 'cause it hurts."
"And I said, well, that's not how it works, Esmeralda."
"If your stomach hurts and you hurt it more, then you hurt more."
"I said, you have to, you know, find the place in you where it hurts and be kind to it, be good to it, give it milk and honey and medicine and it'll heal and you and it will be okay and..."
"Then I thought, if someone's part of you, how do you stop them from hurting you?"
And it's...
"It's by being good to them and being caring to them and giving them milk and honey, you know, and you need to take care of people to hurt you."
"- Yeah, we're all connected."
That hippie shit is true.
"That's not just Trump, that's our Trump, do you understand?"
"And he's in pain, and he's swollen, and we gotta get some ice on him quick and get him in the White House."
- Can't we just tell him he's the president?
"You know, can't we just pretend, so he'll be okay?"
- Like Batboy.
"And, would it were not so, you are my mother."
"Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak."
You shall not budge:
till I set you up a glass.
Where you may see the inmost part of you.
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?
"Help, help, ho!"
"How now, a rat?"
"Dead for a ducat, dead!"
"- O me, what hast thou done?"
"- Nay, I know not."
Is it the king?
When Hamlet gets so upset with his mother in the closet scene... he is already in a pretty disturbed state.
He has after all just killed... he has committed the act of killing for the first time in his life.
"Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell."
I took thee for thy better.
Peace!
Leave wringing of your hands.
Let me wring your heart.
For so I shall if it be made of penetrable stuff.
If damn'd custom have not brazed it so that it be proof... and bulwark against sense.
What have I done that thou dar'st wag thy tongue in noise so rude against me?
"Such an act that blurs the grace and blush of modesty... calls virtue hypocrite, makes marriage vows as false as dicers oaths."
"Ay me, what act, that roars so loud and thunders in the index?"
"Look here upon this picture, and on this..."
See what a grace was seated on this brow...
"Hyperion's curls, the front of Jove himself..."
"An eye like Mars, to threaten and command..."
This was your husband.
Look you now what follows.
Here is your husband... like a mildewed ear blasting his wholesome brother.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Follow me.
"And if I may remind you, please don't touch the walls or any of the objects inside the tomb."
Oh!
Extraordinaire.
Quite extraordinary.
I do congratulate you.
Thank you.
"So, this is what, do you suppose?"
It would appear to be the first of one or more antechambers.
"As you can see, there's another small chamber through a hole near the floor here."
"Ah, oui."
"And at the far end, the entrance to the remainder of the tomb."
- But you have not looked through?
- Of course not.
You are sure this is indeed a tomb and not just a cache?
"This is remarkable, but for a royal tomb it does seem quite small."
I'm not sure of anything yet.
Please don't touch.
At least not until it's been photographed.
I'm sorry.
I'm glad to see that the instincts of the scholar have not been overtaken by those of the treasure hunter.
"I was never a treasure hunter, Monsieur Lacau."
"Very well, you may proceed."
"I shall leave my inspector, Monsieur Ibrahim Mohammed, to attend on my behalf."
You'd be so kind as to give your reports to him.
"And please, let me know when you are ready to break through."
Of course.
I would also be most grateful if you would arrange for a steel gate with a lock to be placed at the entrance of the tomb.
"We do not want any tomb robbers, do we?"
NARRATOR:
It wasn't necessary.
"You're a shoo-in for the nom, and you're gonna sail through the confirmation hearings."
Are you sure?
"From what I hear, these things are a bit of a trap game."
"No, no, the committee loves the idea of having a heavyweight in Beijing."
"And for you, the timing couldn't be better."
"Well, everyone knows that your trilateral commission hasn't come up with any answers."
Here's your parachute.
Let your replacement take the fall.
You think that's why I want the ambassadorship?
"Well, no, of course that's not why you want the job."
Call it a side benefit.
"So you think I'm gonna let the next guy clean up my mess, while I'm 7,000 miles away sipping scorpion bowls in Beijing."
"Okay, relax."
It was an innocent comment.
From a career politician-- that's got to be a first.
I don't know that I have what it takes to join your ranks.
I'm afraid I'll be bored out of my mind if all I did all day long was look out for my own ass.
"Jesus, I didn't mean anything by it."
- Why don't I get the dessert?
- I'm not hungry.
I got this.
I got it.
Change of plans-- my jet doesn't arrive at Jose Marti till noon.
"That gives us time to squeeze in some sightseeing, one last bit of Cuba before you go."
Hector's gonna join us... so we'll take the convertible.
Where's Blanca?
She wasn't feeling well.
I thought I'd let her sleep in.
Are you sure we have time?
Don't look so worried.
The beauty of private aviation-- you never have to miss your flight.
What I'm offering you can't be measured by wealth.
I saw you leave the bodies of your men behind.
They're on the run most of the time... and you can't even afford a funeral.
Are you lecturing me?
My father Commander Haemosu... fled from the Han during his lifetime and wasn't even buried after he died.
"But his dream, his mission, still lives on in our hearts."
But what about your men who die in vain with no hope?
This is what we'll call our nation once we overcome the embargo.
"""Koguryo"""
I'll give you and your men a chance to live and work with dignity.
Don't throw your lives away.
"Help me build Koguryo, the brightest nation under the sun."
Will you accept his offer?
I'd love to escape the Okjuh army... but is it worth dying for?
He's right.
It's suicide to set sail at this time of year.
What do you say?
This is all my father left me.
My father fought with the Damul Army under Commander Haemosu.
Everyone in the hideout was killed after Haemosu was captured... but my mother and I barely escaped.
I was shivering so my mother gave me my father's bloody clothes.
"We had to leave him behind, dead and naked."
I'll never forget it.
I refuse to live on as a criminal.
I will serve you and make my father's dream come true.
How did it go?
Buwiyum has decided to serve me.
Really?
We don't have much time.
We have to leave now.
But Buwiyum's men aren't cut out to be merchants.
What should we do?
"That old lady who came to visit you today, what did she come here for?"
She came to chat with me.
But you didn't talk at all.
Both of you just sat there saying nothing.
And then that old lady bowed to you and left without saying a word.
There are things we don't need words to understand.
"Her husband also died... in Nagasaki, just like Grandpa."
"That's why she comes here now and then... sits down for a while without saying a word, and leaves without saying a word."
There are people who are silent... while they are talking.
"This one, Suzukichi... the youngest brother."
He was a little weak in the head.
Ever since he lost all of his hair from the atomic bomb... he shut himself up in a room and stayed there.
But on hot summer days... it must have been insufferable for him.
"He used to slip out when the moon came up, and sneak away for a swim... in the basin of a waterfall deep in the mountains."
"That's right, yes."
That waterfall is a nice one.
You should go there sometime.
"And then, that boy, what was he doing every day in the room?"
- He just kept on drawing pictures.
- What kind of pictures?
"For some strange reason, only pictures of eyes."
- Eyes?
- Eyes like this.
"As long as there was paper... he just drew eyes, never getting tired of it."
He's spooky!
I bet those were eyes seen through an obsession.
He loathed the idea of being seen with his hairless head.
And he must have been obsessed by the eyes of people.
It must be those eyes.
This kind of drawing?
That's it!
That's exactly it.
That's it?
A name?
"Yeah, and it's more than I had a few hours ago."
"But now that I do have a name, I get to meet with her parents and tell them that their child was murdered for no apparent reason while trying to find out what they know of her last 48 hours alive."
That's what I get to do.
"Then I'll leave you to that, detective."
"Keep in mind Fitzroy, I'm not doing this for you."
I don't even like you.
"Since we are affording each other the courtesy of bluntness,"
I don't like you either.
Vicki seems to trust you with her life.
That's good enough for me.
Any luck with the insects?
I sent them to the morgue this morning.
Dr. Mohadevan is sending them to an entomologist at the university for identification.
What about the second victim?
Evan Crane has a puncture wound on his arm.
I was just talking to him the night before and now he's dead.
"I know, but you're just going to have to put that aside for now."
"Okay, tell me about the injections."
"Well, it's either that or a sting - her words, not mine."
So it's bugs or drugs.
Maybe it's both.
"Okay, now you're losing me."
"No, listen."
What if there is a substance common to both victims that is somehow attractive to the bugs.
- Like some kind of pheromone?
"- Yeah, maybe it's being sold as a party drug down at the club."
And you think whoever's selling the drug doesn't even know it?
"No, I didn't say that."
But why?
Let's start with who.
"I guess he owns, like, this big company or something."
So he is making me take this DNA test and... and sign this agreement that says that I'll never sue him.
- That's crazy.
- Like I want his money?
"Just sign the papers, and then sail off on your yacht and I promise I will never think of you ever again."
- And I have to see him.
- Why?
"'Cause we both have to be there at the test, to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever."
I know you didn't want to know anything about him.
Guess I don't have a choice.
Some people do.
Just think about it.
"I'm really busy, Timothy."
What is it you need?
"I, um, wanted to let you know that I've been asked to represent the teachers on the search committee for the new principal."
"I know that you have, um, thrown your hat in the ring, and..."
And you should recuse yourself.
What I was going to say was I plan on being completely professional and keeping any personal feelings out of it.
"- And I hope you will, too."
- So I'm just supposed to trust you on this?
"After you gave me your word you would sign the donor contract, and then suddenly decided that you couldn't?"
Yeah.
My client will be here any minute.
And my client was pulled from school for this.
"I apologize, Mr. Quinn's been held up."
He won't be able to make it.
Will it be sufficient if you tell Mr. Quinn everything was done by the book?
Absolutely.
He no-showed?
Are you kidding?
What a jerk.
"He makes you jump through all these dumb hoops, the least he could do is show up."
"""so it's not all about you."""
I didn't say that.
"So I got there and I was worried that everyone was going to be quite pretentious and kind of, you know, ""I'm so organic""."
But everyone was really nice.
I really liked everyone and it's a very sort of nice place.
How many people were there?
"There's about 40, you get assigned rooms and I got assigned a room with quite a famous actress."
Can we guess?
You'll never guess it.
Downton Abbey.
EastEnders.
You'll never guess it.
No?
"But in the first couple of minutes, she went to me, ""You're not very good with silence, are you?"""
"I was like, ""Me?"
Love a bit of silence.
"Love it!"""
"And I'm not very good with silence either, being an anxious person and so we go for the day of silence, and I thought it'd be fine,"
"""I'll just read, eat, you know, it's fine,"""
"and then they say, ""You can't do those things,"
"""you just have to be alone in your own head with your own thoughts."""
Whoa.
"So about ten minutes in, I was ruined, I was like, ""What?"
"!"""
"They didn't say you couldn't walk anywhere, so it was on this lovely grounds and I went walking and there was a big, old tyre swing."
You know those tyre swings on a rope?
"And I got up and thought,"
"""I'll walk there, they didn't say anything about the tyre."
"""They would've mentioned if we couldn't go."""
I got up and there was like 30 other people queuing to get on this tyre.
"For three hours, we just got on and off this tyre, just eyeballing each other, like, ""You've been on there long enough, mate""."
It was the longest 12 hours.
He's a junkie.
"That's what you get, tommy."
"Hey, tom, it's lou."
You want to talk about anything?
?
Garrity went nuts about the money.
Worried.
I realized I forgot my wallet.
"To be honest, I felt bad about leaving you to clean up in a room full of booze."
So much temptation.
"In the cab on the way back there, I realized, wouldn't it be awesome if tommy was just sitting at the bar drinking himself silly when I got there?"
I like when you drink.
"And lo and behold, my wish came true."
Although silly ain't exactly what I saw.
"Sober, you're a great fireman and a selfish, spiteful, hit the nail on the head, no bullshit kind of a guy."
"Drunk, you're a great fireman and a selfish, spiteful, hit the nail on the head kind of guy, but funny."
And I like funny.
So I say we keep the booze and we lose the guns.
"I know you've got demons jumping out of your head, I just don't want you shooting at them."
We'll tell the guys you saw rats the size of michael moore running around the joint.
"You know, which means, of course, that they were big and wearing little baseball caps, and they were also in favor of gun control laws."
All right.
I just want to say--ahem-- thanks for tonight.
"And, uh, ahem, I take back all those nasty things I said when we were having that, uh, tiff the other..."
I didn't mean all that stuff.
Ok.
You're really the best friend a guy could ever have.
"Water under the bridge, pal."
What?
The things that you said?
What about them?
Do you take them back?
"A summer job, yeah, and I did that thing"
- I probably shouldn't say this but it was a long time ago - where I would send people's bags astray if they were really objectionable.
"Shut up, you did not."
"I did, once or twice."
You actually put the wrong tag on?
I actually did.
"In those days it wasn't automated so you just had tags for the different cities and if somebody was like a real prick, you would just be, ""OK, if that's the way you want to play this."""
"""This bag's going to Nam."""
"But, if they were nice people, then..."
You'd give them an extra bag.
No.
I went one better.
You had that power.
A matchmaker.
"So if you met this lovely lady and a really nice guy came along, you would just go, ""OK,"" I remember, I would take a little note of where I put her and I would match-make."
"Oh, my God!"
That's wonderful.
"You know this is all going on in your head, you know that, don't you?"
Genuinely happened.
"The bag thing, I probably did it once."
Where did you send the bags?
"Well, the guy was going to Toronto and I sent it to Melbourne."
Melbourne!
They're pretty far apart.
"What is wrong with you, your ass is stuck to the floor, your boots are made of lead."
"I read a book that you wrote, a novel that you wrote, back in the '90s, you wrote it, didn't you?"
"And in that, there was a fearsome amount of drinking that went on."
"Yeah, there was, yeah."
"It was a novel, though, it wasn't an autobiography."
I should point that out.
Was that a big part of your youth?
I was kind of...
"When i say up and down, erie goes wiggle-waggle."
Fisk and boyd are definitely interested in that wiggle-waggle.
We been in that wiggle-waggle business for years.
You want vanderbilt to believe that he's buying control of your railroad.
But he really ain't.
Exactly.
"First we'll declare a dividend, the biggest ever declared by any railroad."
"Let's say, uh, 50%."
50%?
I ain't got no money in the treasury for that.
"Now wait a minute, uncle daniel."
You'll have an awful battle on your hands if you tangle with vanderbilt.
He's got the key to wall street in his pocket.
"He told you this morning he was after your scalp, and you haven't got a chinaman's chance unless you can outmaneuver him."
And my plan might do the trick.
"With your stock paying such a big, fat dividend the public will break their necks trying to buy, and the price will shoot up."
"So if vanderbilt wants the stock bad enough, he'll have to stick his nose in the trap to get it."
Even i can see that.
"Well, who said i couldn't see it, too?"
"You know, i object to giving uncle whiskers all our good ideas."
Who said they was good ideas?
Who said anything about giving?
We get 50% of the profits.
"Oh, no, no, i didn't promise you nothing like that."
"We'll trust you, uncle daniel."
"'Cause if you start operating this way without us, oh, we'll put a bug in vanderbilt's ear."
"No, boys, no."
"It's agreed, then?"
50%?
"Well, i always say, him that gives gets."
"But you're teaching an old dog new tricks, jimmy."
"Uncle daniel, you got time to give me a shine?"
"So, let's both pray I get it right."
GIL:
"Well, in the immortal words,"
"""Here's another nice mess I've gotten myself into. """
All her adult life she's been saving herself for that moment?
It's like what's she saying?
I'm the man of her dreams?
I'm not the man of anyone's dreams.
I'm the stuff of nightmares.
"'Cause, you know, to look at her, you'd think she was so progressive and contemporary and experienced."
"And now, she's never had sex before."
She probably expects sparks to come flying out of her fingers every time we do it.
"But then, she's a lovely person, she's warm, intelligent and highly skilled."
You should be flattered she wants to be with you.
"And maybe it'll all work out and she'll turn out to be the love of your life, just the way you wrote it in the show."
That whole idea you got from Irene that day about the one human being on earth who's really right for you.
"Oh, God, Bob and Irene."
That's another whole can of worms I've got to open sooner or later.
"Sorry, Gil, just run that past me again."
The World Wildlife Fund.
"-Yeah, I just thought, you know, it would be...."
"-That's like pandas, rhinoceroses and tigers?"
'Cause I think you said once she always loved cats.
"-GBP1 7,000."
"-I mean, it's never enough, obviously."
"And they do so much great work 'cause you've got these performing bears, in Russia, and they rescue them, you know, and make sure they get a decent quality of life."
"So, if anyone deserves your mother's money...."
"The thing is, you've just got to try and snap out of it, Ali."
It's not rocket salad.
I've told you before.
"I mean, you read all this stuff about how you're supposed to deal with all your problems."
I know.
I don't want there to be any misunderstanding.
"You spend one more minute on this case, other than telling Oliver it's his,"
- I'm shutting you down.
- What the hell does that mean?
It means I'm going to the hearing tomorrow and telling them that you broke your agreement.
"And I don't care who the judge is, they'll toss the clinic off the case, and your friend Oscar won't get a dime."
♪♪
"Louis, stop blending!"
I have news.
"Katrina, thank God you're back."
"Here, have a prunie."
Exactly how many prunies did you make?
I don't know.
I'm stress blending.
"If I don't hear some good news soon, there's gonna be an international prune shortage."
So please tell me that you talked Stephanie out of this bullshit.
"Louis, I couldn't talk her out of it, but I did manage to talk her into this."
"Okay, well, I can live with this amount."
But this says that I admit to sexually harassing her.
- You did sexually harass her.
"- Oh, that's a load of crap."
I never hit on Stephanie Patel.
"And that's not the definition of harassment, and you know it."
"Well, I don't care."
I can't accept it.
- Why not?
"- Because I've been sued for sexual harassment before, and I can't have it look like a pattern."
I didn't know.
"It was before your time, and it was a bullshit suit concocted by Daniel Hardman."
I can't have a reputation for this.
"I understand that, Louis, but Stephanie is worried people think she can't hack it as a lawyer, and making you admit to what you did is the only way she sees to make them think otherwise."
I'm sorry.
You have to forget.
I would do anything for you.
What do I care about Beatrice?
"For me, there's nothing else in the world but you."
It's your fault it's gone this far.
What does it matter now who's to blame?
Perhaps all is not lost...
You still deny you murdered your father?
- Naturally.
But you confessed.
- Anyone will confess under torture.
"If you're innocent, there's still a chance to save yourself."
"Admit you saw Calvetti murder your father, and that you lied to protect him."
"We could consider you the victim of, shall we say, ""an unhappy romance""."
Your youthfulness has moved the judges... and there are rumours going around Rome that we've been too hard on you.
"Just for once, you could help justice."
Think about it...
You can still live.
"Of course, we can't absolve you... you're guilty of perjury."
But you'd only be placed in a convent for a length of time determined by the court.
"And, when the echoes of this trial are silenced... it won't be impossible to obtain a pardon for you."
You could have a normal life...
"You could get married, have children."
Why do you insist on defending that man?
Why?
You ruined yourself for him.
And what has he done for you?
Did he give himself up to save you?
No!
He's abandoned you.
You don't know what you're talking about;
he hasn't abandoned me.
And our budget is limited.
Find a way.
Find a way to reduce the thickness!
"I know you're anxious, Lieutenant, but this isn't going to work."
You know that there are metals that you can and can't forge.
How is it going?
Not very well?
"We had surplus lumber for galleys and speed crafts, so the hull will be build quickly if we work day and night, but..."
I guess our problem is still the iron plates.
What do we do?
We need the Turtle Ship the High Commander is going to have a chance.
"Do something, fellows!"
Can't you get those iron plates thin and light like willow leaves?
This is so frustrating!
Iron is not paper.
Why do you keep pushing us knowing that it's impossible?
"I'm frustrated, that's why."
Do you think we're working with brass?
Metal... that means we have to change the type of metal...
But can we?
Can we change the metal?
I'll handle the construction of the hull on the Turtle Ship.
I can't let you be in charge of it the way you're running around so anxious and frantic.
I can't fail.
I cannot fail this time?
Haste isn't going to solve anything.
It's better to go around than to fall into the ditch.
Make it work.
Do whatever it takes to reduce the weight of the iron plates.
And stay away from the Turtle Ship until you've resolved this problem.
Will you stay reticent?
Prime Minister...
So this makes them the largest venomous animal in the world.
And I'm about to meet them.
Great(!
)
"Oh, my goodness!"
Look at this.
"It's not, is it?"
They're huge!
"That's a really big one, isn't it?"
My goodness me.
How big would you say that is?
"This one, probably 80kg."
Are they aggressive to you?
They keep an eye on us.
We have to be careful.
But this is where you live - the rangers live here.
And this is the office where - we were talking to Main yesterday - that's where he was attacked.
"Yes, there's still blood remaining on the windows.Oh, dear!"
And they can climb up these steps?
"Of course, that's why we have to be careful.God, I thought I was ugly."
"They really are not the most attractive animals, there's nothing about them that endears us as mammals to them, but I daresay they love each other in their own way."
"They're so well armed - you've got those amazing claws, like tiger talons, and a really powerful tail they can knock an animal as big as a horse and a water buffalo over with, and the shark-like teeth."
He's nuzzling.
We could get some gay action going on.
How long have you studied and worked with Komodo dragons?
Since 2002.
Do you - this is a strange question - do you like them?
"The first time, I have to be honest, it is a dangerous species and I have to be careful and I was a little bit worried, but after one year, two years, I try to love my job."
And do you now?
Yes.
You do.This is the only dragons that live in Indonesia which is my country.
I'm proud of it and it's kind of my pride.
"You know, this does require a certain amount of concentration."
"What, am I bothering you?"
Maybe i'll go get some air.
This must be the river she saw in her vision.
Assuming she's telling the truth.
Just because there's another wraith doesn't necessarily mean you can trust her.
What do you got?
Fresh tracks.
It's him.
Now do you believe?
I still think there's something more to this than she and Zaddik are telling us.
"He's heading upstream, into the hills."
Let me ask you something.
"If you can prove to everyone that I'm telling the truth, that Ellia no longer needs to feed, do you think the villagers would accept her?"
That's what I'm afraid of.
"No matter how hard we try to convince them, they'll always see her as a monster."
"I'm getting old, doctor."
"Oh, you've got lots of time."
Never have as much as we think you have.
"And when I'm gone, she'll be alone."
I tried to teach her about love and human companionship.
But that's exactly what she'll never have.
"Zaddik, there's something I want to show you."
"I didn't say anything at first, because I didn't want to get your hopes up."
"It's a retrovirus, something I've been working on."
I don't understand.
"Oh, god."
How am I going to explain this?
"Part of Ellia is human, and part of her comes from a creature we call the Iratus bug."
It's the part that makes her look the way she does and where her desire to feed comes from.
"Now, it's possible, by means of this retrovirus, we can strip away those parts, and leave only the human parts behind."
You mean she-- she'd be like you and me?
"No, but he found out."
"I asked him to share it with me, but he wouldn't."
He wanted me to come to you and admit the whole thing.
"If I didn't, he was going to tell you himself."
"So but none of that's important now, I only need a little more time."
"You're not going anywhere, Sara."
You just don't get off a spaceship and run.
I'll kill the first one that puts his head outside this door.
"Well, she's one of your crew, you'd better get after her."
Locked!
"It's clear enough why she acted as she did, but why go on with it?"
"Once Blake left with the neutrotope, there was no need for more killing."
I don't understand that myself.
What worries me is that she's still so confident.
She hasn't a hope of escaping yet she's still holding out.
How did she hope to dispose of the neutrotope when we reached Destiny?
She probably made contact with a prospective buyer when you were collecting it.
It wouldn't be too difficult.
What is it?
I know what she's planning.
Why she sabotaged the ship.
"Well, don't keep us in suspense."
Ever since the controls were damaged we have been in the same space position.
A homing beam transmitter and it's operating.
Anyone tuned into its frequency can locate us exactly.
That's why she's not worried.
Another ship is coming to get her and it's on its way now.
- Destroy it!
- Too late.
They will have had a fix on us for some time now.
And when they get here and find the neutrotope not on board?
It wouldn't matter if it was.
Is it too fanciful to believe in this great puzzle called life... we are each born to be one of a perfect pair?
"You see, I have never known anyone before who discards that strange stringy bit on a banana as I do."
-And the most remarkable thing of all....
-You don't need to say it.
-The telepathy between us.
-Don't you think it's truly astonishing?
"You see, dear Jack, I wonder if you can tell what I am thinking now."
"Well, let me tell you what I'm thinking."
That this moment now is more precious than I can say.
"The two of us here, the song of a curlew, the first budding leaves of spring, and yet, this time tomorrow it will all be just a memory."
"Oh, yes."
How sad that we both should dwell on that.
I think I fear the passing of time more than anything.
But it teaches me at least to value the present.
And not to take for granted a single second the two of us are together.
CLEO:
What is she like?
You know she used to put love bites in her neck with a garlic press?
As true as I'm sitting here.
"Every night, so everyone thought she'd pulled."
Stacey told me that one.
"Oh dear, who's coming over to stay next week, actually."
So that will be a riot.
'Cause did I tell you?
"She's got this thing right, my sister, where you can never tell if she's laughing or crying."
Both sound exactly the same.
"Like, she'll be going...."
"And you'll go running into the room, ""What is it, Stace?"
"What's the matter?"""
She'll be sitting there watching The Simpsons.
"Or else, then she'll ring you up, she's going, ""I think I'm pregnant."""
"-Sorry, are we getting on your nerves?"
You must eat and rest to get your strength back.
We'll leave soon enough.
We don't want to keep her waiting any longer than we have to.
Keep who waiting?
She must miss you so terribly.
Is hard to bear... thinking of her alone in that dark cell.
"Is been difficult for all of us, but don't worry, we'll get her out."
You'll see your mother again.
Our world has come under attack before.
You can understand our concern at finding strangers who arrive secretly from a hidden ship.
"I assure you, we have no hostile intentions."
"I believe you, but some of my colleagues are cautious about dealing with... disreputable ships."
What does that mean?
It seems you've been making more enemies than friends since you arrived from the...
"Alpha Quadrant, is it?"
Some think even that story is a lie.
But not you.
Of course not.
I am here to help.
Then I'd like to talk to my crew members.
I'm afraid that will be difficult in the current climate of mistrust.
Perhaps if you could tell us more about what brought you here... who you've been dealing with.
I'll consider that after I talk to my crew members.
You're not making it very easy for me to help you.
Let me see what I can arrange.
It may take some time.
Commander.
Talk to your contacts again.
I want an alternative to sitting here waiting for him to get back to us.
Your question is based on a faulty assumption.
I cannot answer it.
You can't deny being in contact with the resistance.
That means I can screw up 11 times.
♪ For the first time in my life ♪
♪ I see love. ♪
"so, Molly's belongings are precious gold, but you got to hide your worthless crap in my garage?"
I'm not hiding it.
Then I'll sneak it in one box at a time.
Wonderful.
Lies and deception.
The mortar that holds the bricks of love together.
It worked for you and dad.
Those were simpler times.
What happened to my air hockey game?
"You know, Mikey,"
I'm not one to cast judgment on how other people choose to live their lives...
Here we go.
But rushing to move in with this woman is a horrible mistake that you'll regret the rest of your life.
"Well, don't sugarcoat it, mom."
How do you really feel?
"Hey, what happened to all my G.I. Joe stuff?"
"In my day, we didn't shack up with somebody until we had rings on our fingers and rice in our hair."
"Listen, Molly and I love each other, and getting rid of my apartment is a good way for us to save money."
"Well, if you really wanted to save money, you never should have moved out of this house."
"Yes, but that would have ended in a murder-suicide."
Fine.
"But when she gets tired of peeling your dirty drawers off the floor, you always got three hots and a cot here with me and Jim."
And 's all the incentive I need to make it work.
"Seriously, I can't find my stretch Armstrong, my baseball cards, nothing."
"Hey, I had a garage sale, okay?"
And you sold my stuff?
"Well, if you don't sprinkle in a few toys, it just looks like a sad, old shut-in having a pre-death estate sale."
"Oh, man."
"And if the guy across the street ever asks, you never wore that orange swimsuit."
"And I'm there, you know, with my mouth gaping wide open as she's drilling into me and packing my gums, screwing in all these clamps."
"God, you know, there's all this Freudian symbolism going on,"
I just woke up steaming.
"I tell you, this could put a whole new spin on my next appointment."
Bye!
"You know, the biggest irony here... that all that had been going on for two years and I had no idea."
All these clandestine accounts and funds she was squirreling away for our old age.
Not an inkling.
"You know, I'm supposed to be a news editor."
Couldn't see a story that was right under my nose.
"Yes, well."
"I think that worktop's looking pretty spotless now, actually."
"I know, I'm pathetic."
Look at me.
Pouring all my angst into a dishcloth.
"Not a bit of it, Stephen, don't be silly."
I think it says a lot about a man who's prepared to clean.
It's a very rare and virtuous quality.
I mean...
"I know it must seem as if your whole world has just collapsed right now, but...."
"God, Alice, if I ever get through this in one piece...."
You'll get through it.
Of course you will.
Because people do.
Look... do you know one of the most horrible things in life... is the speed that time just flashes past us.
How quickly a moment becomes a memory.
"But that can work the other way as well, you know, because... you'll be amazed how soon she'll be back here."
"The two of you, you know...."
You'll have learned something from the experience.
It's always the way.
"And you'll be around, won't you?"
"To begin with, at least."
Carry on about the badger.
"So, badger..."
"See, now I'm intrigued."
"So, badger... ..badger only releases upon hearing the crack of bone, so you carry the stick and then if the badger grabs you, you get the stick and you crack it over your other knee."
Why don't you crack it over the badger's head?
"The badger hears, thinks it's broken your leg and returns to its bed."
So it's satisfied?
"Once it's broken your leg, it will just walk away from you?"
"I'm imagining the badger would think,"
"""I've killed my competitor"" not, 'Good, his leg's broke."""
"I'm going to go into the forest with an erection, wait for a badger to attack me, I'm going to let it break my leg."
"And then I'm going to pick it up and shake it and go,"
"""You didn't think this through!"""
"And I'm going to shake it, looking at my penis and go,"
"""And I'm going to go into your home"
"""and I'm going to make love to your wife"
"""and I'm going to befriend your kids"
"""and I'm going to do loads of work for nature."
"""Whereas YOU are going on the train line, my friend."""
We are through the looking glass now and I'm going to have to tell you this.
How long were you in a van for?
A year and a half.
What?
"OK, van..."
This was an RV.
"This was a 45-foot bus, two leather couches, five flatscreen TVs."
That's a Winnebago.
"It had a dry sauna, it had a stackable washer-dryer, it had a full shower, so ""van""..."
It's a recreational vehicle.
Recreational vehicle.
Where they made crystal meth in Breaking Bad.
That's right.
"Jeffrey, sorry, mate, we've got to be on those reverses by 4:00 or the excrement's in the air conditioning."
Didn't they do well?
You must be pleased.
"Well, yeah, it's like a whole extra dimension to what I wrote which... really rounds it all out."
Yeah.
"So, anyway...."
What do you think about this thing with my neighbours?
"I mean, don't you think that it's all totally bizarre?"
"Yeah, it is bizarre."
"But, I suppose, rather touching that... when it came down to it, at the end of her life, she didn't have any time for her own son or the woman he married."
The only thing that really meant anything to her was you picking up that spoon.
"Oh, God."
Just got a real shiver down the back of the neck when you said that.
"You're right, like a real Rosebud moment."
Guess I'm gonna have to go away and give it some careful thought.
I don't think I will.
"-I'm seeing Amanda tonight, my dentist."
-You're kidding?
"No, you don't want a cavity full of crumbs."
"Once her tongue goes in, no way."
"We're meeting up for a drink, that's all it is."
Maybe a bite to eat afterwards.
"Hey, how you doing?"
"We were just saying, weren't we, it's all looking really great."
"Really, thanks."
"What about the breakfast scene, ""War is heck"", all that stuff?"
"-Right on the money, we thought, didn't we?"
-Yeah?
Most people aren't even going to get it probably but....
"No, you know, I actually heard a woman say that on Newsnight during the last US election."
"You know, this awful woman from the State Department who was banging on about the case for Iraq."
"And it was so quick, it was like, you know, how you kind of just freeze, like,"
What would you do to a rape victim?
Sign them up for speed dating?
"Okay, this is my way of showing you that we are on the same team, okay?"
We are now prepared in case of all emergencies.
You bought an alarm system without telling me?
"Well, you couldn't pay for it, because you don't have a wallet."
"And I couldn't call you, because you don't have a cell phone."
And you couldn't be closer to not having a boyfriend.
We just bought a bed together.
You're not going anywhere.
"Okay, so we have an alarm for intruders, one for fire, and one for when you cry."
"Whit, I think that water droplet means flood."
I don't think so.
"Okay, so I googled ""escape plans,"" and the first thing we do if there's a fire in the middle of the night is wake each other up."
And then we feel the door to see if it's hot.
"If it is, we go down the fire escape together, together, and once we are safely outside, we talk to a news crew and hope they auto-tune us later."
"Aw, you googled something besides,"
"""Maria Menounous, what's your job?"""
Fire!
Fire!
"Good, you're up."
"That door's not hot, so we can go."
What is wrong with you?
What happened to your plan and all this talk about us working together?
"Okay, I can't believe you tested me."
I can't believe your answer to the test was to push me into the fire!
"Not only did you run, and not save me, you made it harder for me to save myself by body-checking me into the wall."
"Okay, well, to be fair, in a fire, your hair products put you in much more danger than I do."
"Look, these past few days made me realize something, all right?"
"People are either ""fight"" or ""flight."""
"I'm ""fight,"""
"and you're... you're ""flight."""
Look at this.
Do they climb out...
There's one hatching.
They're just about to come out.
Here you go.
Look at this.
Can I hold him?
Yeah.
"Oh, that's the most fantastic animal, isn't it?"
"Literally just been born - effectively, its first sight of the world, isn't it?"
They're perfect.One of the things you'll find with these animals...
"When they're walking down the beach and they can feel something underneath them, then they've got an alternating gait."
"Just on land, to run along the sand."
But the minute they go weightless - so the minute they're in the water - they'll start to swim.
"Oh, wow, that's fantastic."
"So he's swimming along as if he was in the water, and notice also that the head comes up for a breath, just like it would..."
"Look at that, see?"
The head is coming up for a breath as if it were in the water.
"Oh, there are more down there."
"Oh, they're all coming out now."
"Once some of them start to move, that's the message for the ones underneath - ""C'mon, guys, let's come out and go and see the beach."""
Swarm of them - does it say how many eggs?
"Well, there were 81 eggs."
"That's very healthy, extremely healthy."
Let's get these guys out to the ocean rather than keep them waiting around.
"Yes, please.This is excellent."
"Evening time, when hatchlings would typically be coming out."
"So they'd come out just before the sun drops down, would they?"
Yep.
I think this is a good enough spot to let them go.
"The idea is, in nature they would actually come out and run down the beach, and as they're running down, they're picking up on magnetic fields."
"So they need a bit of a run-in, just to orient themselves."
That's Human and Cylon.
Both converge on this planet at this exact moment just as the stars are about to go supernova ?
"I'm not a religious person, Mr. Gaeta, as you both know."
So if this is the work of higher power
Then they have one hell of a sense of humor.
"We have a stand off, very predictable."
"They have the eye, and they'll nuke it if we try to take it."
And we'll shoot them down if they try bringing it up to Galactica.
- How do we know they're not bluffing ?
- You don't.
We threes feel that we can't afford to take the chance.
I think we're missing the big picture here.
We have the opportunity to rid the universe of the human pestilence once and for all.
We can discuss that after we get the Eye of Jupiter.
After we find the path to Earth.
"Let me point out that it doesn't matter if we find Earth in 5 days, or if we find Earth in 5,000 years."
We're machines.
We'll still be around to savor the great miracle.
So let them destroy the Eye.
"If, indeed, they have it."
We have to take advantage of the situation and take down Galactica once and for all.
Or we could stand here and do nothing.
"We're not doing ""nothing"", Cavil."
- Plans are in motion.
"- I'm sorry, what does that mean ?"
D'Anna ?
I've put a heavy Raider down on the planet's surface as soon as we jumped in.
I thought that would be our best chance of slipping by their dradis.
Seems I was right.
Is there any reason the rest of us weren't involved in this decision ?
"It was a ""need-to-know"" mission."
"So now I am telling you, because you need to know."
"You have to understand how much this means to me, how badly I want to succeed at this."
"I'm sure you do, but I really don't see how that's possible any longer."
But-- but I was meant to do this work.
"Well, you might think so, but from what I saw today--"
You saw one mistake!
"And I do understand the work, and I do understand you."
"But what you don't understand is me, how hard I worked to..."
to be a better person.
"You think you know about my life, but you don't."
"You have some vague recollection of my parents, but you have no idea what was going on inside my house."
You don't know that my father left and then my mother made me pretend he was still coming home every night when anyone asked.
"You don't know that he told me that he loved me but that he didn't want a family, when I was the only child."
I was the one that made it a family.
I didn't know that.
"You also don't know that, when my father was in the house... he hit me."
A lot.
"Of course, I thought it was my fault, that somehow, I was bad, that maybe, if I tried harder, he would love me."
"If I just tried harder, maybe none of the bad stuff would happen."
I-I do understand.
"And I hope you know that whatever you did, it wouldn't have made any difference."
I know that now.
And I know... that I have love to give and that I have a kind heart and I was meant to share it.
"And it's only sometimes, very rarely, that I go back to that old me, and I think I have to do what people say or they won't love me."
"And so, just then, I slipped."
But it was just a slip.
"And it's not the me I am now, if that makes any sense."
It does.
I really do want to continue here.
And-- and I am asking you for a second chance.
"Well, um... if the situation were reversed,"
I would hope that someone would give me that chance.
So...

Hi today I am going to tell you about three different kinds of pasta.
The first pasta I am going to tell you about is capellini.
"CAP-A-LEAN-E, also known as angel hair."
This pasta is long and thin.
The second pasta I am going to tell you about is spaghetti.
"SPA-GET-EE, spaghetti is similar to capellini in that it is long and thin, but it is a little bit thicker than capellini."
The third pasta I am going to tell you about is linguini.
LlN-GEEN-EE.
Linguini also means little tongues.
Linguini is flat and long and thin.
So next time you're ordering pasta you will know just what to ask for.

Alright welcome back.
A little new idea for you here and this one applies to learning and most certainly would threaten to turn our current educational system on its head.
What's unclear is whether it's good for America.
"A California school called the Khan Academy is reinventing traditional teaching by giving students lectures that they can watch at home on their own time, re-watch them if they'd like and then having them do the homework when they're in school in the classroom."
Salman:
"By removing the one size fits all lecture from the classroom and letting students have a self pace lecture at home and then when you go to the classroom, letting them do work, having the teacher walk around, having the peers actually be able to interact with each other, these teachers have used technology to humanize the classroom."
Dietrich stated on a note on her Facebook wall:
"""If reporting a rape only got me to the point that I'm not allowed to talk about it, then I regret it."
"I regret reporting it."""
"But, one good thing that has come out of this is that Savannah recently opened her Facebook page to the public, allowing hundreds of random friend requests from people offering financial support and petitions in her cause."
"And with her Facebook page and Twitter account,"
"Savannah Dietrich gets to control what people see of her, for once."
"It's ironic that technology, which helped humiliate her previously, is now allowing her to put her best foot forward."
"The judge behind the ruling is named Judge Deana ""Dee"" McDonald."
The defense attorneys for her rapists are
Chris Klein and David Mejia.
Oh!
"And her rapists, the boys who decided to violate this girl and spread that violation throughout her highschool, potentially ruining her youth, their names are Will Frey and uh I'll spell this for you if you want to write it down, that's Will, like Will, and then Frey."
F. R. E. Y.
"And the other rapist is Austin Zehnder, that's Z.E.H.N.D.E.R."
Please do not share this information or let anyone know that there are two rapists in Kentucky named Will Frey and Austin Zehnder.
Because Judge Deana McDonald doesn't want you to.
Nor do their lawyers David Mejia and Chris Klein.
"That's David Majia and Chris Klein, uh, Will Frey"
Austin Zehnder
Austin Zehnder and Will Frey
Perfect!
Now of course there are two sides to every story.
"For example, Will Frey and Austin Zehnder ""allegedly"" raped Savannah Dietrich."
Oh!
Wait.
Sorry.
No.
"They plead guilty, so yeah, they definitely raped her."
"The thing is it's important that we protect the identities of Will Frey and Austin Zehnder, because, like, this could look really bad for Will Frey and Austin Zehnder."
"Like, real bad."
Cuz they're rapists.
It's insane to me that a court system would allow a victim of sexual assault to be silenced.
It's the perfect color and so hip
Always gotta keep in mind my pacing
Making sure the cloth's correctly facing
I'm stitching Twilight's dress
"Yard by yard, fussing on the details"
Jewel neckline Don't you know a stitch in time saves nine?
Make her something perfect to inspire
Even though she hates formal attire
Gotta mind those intimate details
Even though she's more concerned with sales
It's Applejack's new dress
Dressmaking's easy For Pinkie Pie something pink
Fluttershy something breezy
Blend color and form...
Do you think it looks cheesy?
"Something brash, perhaps quite fetching"
Hook and eye Couldn't you just simply die?
Making sure it fits forelock and crest
Don't forget some magic in the dress
Even though it rides high on the flank
Rainbow won't look like a tank
I'm stitching Rainbow's dress
"Piece by piece, snip by snip"
"Croup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip"
"Thread by thread, primmed and pressed"
"Yard by yard, never stressed"
And that's the Art of the Dress!
That's it.
Keep them closed.
Don't look.
"Okay, you can look now!"
These are your new outfits.
"First, these men steal all the pillows... ...and then the dogs steal the mattresses."
The dogs float their mattresses to the candy shop.
WOW!
CANDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[music starts]
When I was a young man I carried my pack
And I lived the free life of a rover
From the Murrays green basin to the dusty outback
I waltzed my Matilda all over
Then in nineteen fifteen my country said Son
It's time to stop rambling 'cause there's work to be done
So they gave me a tin hat and they gave me a gun
And they sent me away to the war
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we sailed away from the quay
And amidst all the tears and the shouts and the cheers
We sailed off for Gallipoli
How well I remember that terrible day
When the blood stained the sand and the water
When how in that hell that they called Suvla Bay
We were butchered like lambs at the slaughter
"Johnny Turk he was ready, he primed himself well"
"He showered us with bullets, and he rained us with shells"
And in five minutes flat he'd blown us all to hell
Nearly blew us right back to Australia
And the band played Waltzing Matilda
As we stopped to bury our slain
And we buried ours and the Turks buried theirs
And it started all over again
"Now those who were living, did their best to survive"
"In that mad world of death, blood and fire"
And for seven long weeks I kept myself alive
"When you say, i'm born this way"
"What is the thing that your community can't accept about you, Lady Gaga does ?"
"Nadim: "" about "" Born This Way I want to tell the world, that I was Born This Way """
What way ?
"Nadim: "" My personality is revolutionary in the community """
What is that you don't like about the community ?
"Nadim: "" The artistic things """
"Lady Gaga concentrates on Social issues too, What Issues are those ?"
"What does Lady Gaga once did, and you said, I have that iddue in my community ?"
"Nadim: "" People's physical appearance """
"Nadim: "" Relationship between people, who's based on lies, and they judge you for how you look like """
"Nadim: ""and they lie about you, they always judge looks """
What are Lady Gaga's ideas and thoughts ?
We talked about the love lately
"Nadim: "" When she strated, she cared about pop-culture """
Who is she defending ?
"Nadim: "" She's defending, people who are being abused, sexually, or physically .."
""" .."
"At schools and anywhere else, and also the gay community """
"She's defending the gay community so clearly, in every song ?"
Nadim:
"""Yes, Cause they humans too, we are all the same """
"Nadim: "" And every where in this world, most of the artist, wants to help them and fight for their rights """
"Nadim: "" Because those people, are the ones that understand art very well """
"Lady Gaga says : "" You're free to do whatever you want to"" right ?"
"What do You want to do, and wish to do, but can't ?"
"Nadim: "" To be myself .. """
"Nadim: "" The real person I dream to become """
Why aren't you that person ?
"Nadim: "" Cause I am living a stressed life, in school or home """
"Nadim: "" But I have a lot of dreams, I want to develope but I can't """
"What kind of stress, that stops you from achieving your dreams ?"
"We headed to one of the Quran Institues here in chechnya, and Indeed I was amazed from what I've seen"
Its as though the Dream is now Reality.
"Before I came to chechnya, I was told that they focus so much on their Quran [especially the kids]"
"But when I came here, I found their Institutes to be very different from the other Institutes."
Some of you may think that I am standing in a Random Public Garden or a park.
"No By Allah, I am standing in a park that belongs to Quran Institue"
A very distinguished Institute that has many things to help the students to memorize the Quran.
I wish that this dream comes to reality back in my country and in other countries as well.
"The dream of this great concern about the Book of Allah here in Chechnya, Come with me to check it out"
"This institute... has special Rooms for Their students a classes that fits their schedule well, and a Cafeteria that provides their daily meals."
"And they have a Masjid of their own, along with a wide green field, for the students to enjoy their break time"
"But Truly, the most Beautiful thing we found in this institute.."
"Is the Organized system of the institute, along with its discipline from the Hufadh of the Book of Allah Swt."
Who can start reciting for us a portion of what they have memorized from the Quran?
"MashaAllah TabarakAllah, Do you listen to Shaykh Abu Bakr Al Shatri?"
"-Yes he does -MashaAllah, May Allah make you"
-..become like Shaykh Abu Bakir al Shatri.
Congratulation to AbuBakr for having
-.. the kids of chechnya listening to him.
May This is all be found in his scale of good deeds
Institute of Shaykh Zayid - Chechnya.
while I was walking around the institute.. here in Chechnya
"The insititute of Shaykh Zayid for Quran Memorization and while I was listening to their beautiful recitation, I met a boy named Ikhwaan"
It was said to me that this young boy is 12 years old and has the Quran Memorized.
"MashaAllah Shaykh Adam, When did ikhwaan start memorizing the Quran? - he started memorizing as soon as we opened up this Institute which was 8months ago."
- He started memorizing 8 months ago? - yes he did.
"MashaAllah Tabarak AlRahman, he memorized the Quran only in 8months! honestly I am a little shocked because he doesn't speak Arabic right? - yes he doesnt."
"-But with that, his main focus was to memorize.."
-..the Quran in 8-9 months.
And he sure did.
MashaAllah.
- How many pages does he memorize a day?

"From page 168 to 169,"
Jesus's character says:
"""Those who love me"""
"""are in all existing systems."""
"""They are buddhists or mormons,"""
"""baptists or muslims,"""
"""democrats and republicans,"""
"""and others that don't vote and"""
"""are not part of any religious institution."""
"""There are bankers, players,"""
"""americans and iraquians,"""
"""jews and palestinians."""
"""I do not want you to become christians."""
"""But I want to join them in their process"""
"""to transform into sons and daughters of Dad."""
"""Into brothers and sisters, into my beloved."""
"These are the words of Jesus, of his character, the main character of the book."
It is an interesting sentence.
"Indeed, says that Jesus can be anywhere."
Any system.
But what called my attention was the affirmation:
"""I do not want you to become christians."""
"And, depending on what christian is, the word ""christian"" in each person's mind can have different meanings."
"And, depending on what christian is,"
Jesus doesn't want us to become christians.
"So you can understand this, about the designation ""christian"", the word ""christian"", you will find people with completely different ideas."
Antagonistic.
"You will find Ku Klux Klan, who were protestant christians. and Martin Luther King."
Practice your presentation until you feel comfortable.

Welcome to the Simulation Center at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
"My name is Marissa Carrillo, the simulation technician providing your tour."
"The simulation center is currently located on University of Alaska Anchorage campus, in the School of Nursing."
We have two high-fidelity simulation rooms with one control room.
Each patient room is equipped with medical supplies and enhanced with features that may be found in a hospital room to practice care of patients.
This is our adult human patient simulator or adult simulation mannequin.
Can you see the chest rise or did you notice his blinking?
"I can listen to heart, lung, and bowel sounds."
"I can check his carotid, brachial, radial, femoral, popliteal, and pedal pulses too!"
What are the more exciting capabilities?
"Interventions such as CPR, defibrillation, IVs, intubation, and urinary catheterization may also be performed on the mannequin."
"(""Go Away"") Oh, and he can speak too."
Sounds like now is the time that we should visit the SimBaby.

What's his name?
"I don't know, but he is like my brother"
He was killed by an APC running over him
My name is Ibrahim Azzouz
"They [army] created a trap for us, they let us approach the Radio &amp;amp; Television building"
Then the army ranks advanced on us
They began by firing shots at us
"After that they beat us with sticks, bringing us to the ground"
"After a while, the army APCs started driving around recklessly"
The APCs then started driving into the crowds hitting people
"Some people had their faces crushed in, some were sliced in half"
These were scenes of inhumane acts
From the army!
The Army that is supposed to protect us!
Our Army crushed us like cattle!
"Give us a chance to unite, we are brothers"
Patience ...

"Someone from Ezbet Nakhl, and the brother of Mina that they killed and have been laid to rest inside - Who has done this?"
The terrorist Tantawi ...
The Marshal ... he killed the young people inside
"But he is blind, because if he acknowledges those before him that are now in prison, he would not act this way"
"But the day will come, when God will take from him as he took from those that have been killed"
Not just him .. all of them
And may God put me to rest like those here
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...
The people demand the fall of the Marshal ...

The events of last night in front of Maspero [Egyptian Radio &amp;amp; Television Building]
Have resulted in the deaths of 24 Martyrs amongst our children
So let's talk about your characters.
Your characters are what can... are going to drive your book.
It's still 10 days away.
Ok.
"Quickly I went back to the message,  the first one and what I found is this, obviously."
"He was talking about Tuesday, August 20."
"And I was understanding, of course,  it was the time."
"There is a very thin line  between what I want to say, what I say, what the other guy  wants to hear and the way he understands it."
And any deviation in this thin line automatically puts us in what we generally call... a misunderstanding.
And even though  it produces discomfort to us
"I propose to you the idea that behind our misunderstandings  there is a lot of very useful information at first hand about ourselves, which is also giving us  an opportunity of learning, that allows us to grow and helps us  improve our relationships."
"Lets see, in 1514, spanish explorer"
"Francisco Fernández de Córdoba landed in the shores of the peninsula  he called Yucatán, because that was the word  natives pronunced when he asked them what was the name  of those shores in which he had landed."
"Later, it was known that  in the mayan language,"
"Yucatán means ""I don't understand""."
(Laughter)
"As I was saying,  our misunderstandings speak more about the way in which  we perceive things, than the way things are."
"We are constantly filtering  what we perceive and we do so all the time,  in a major or minor scale."
"As the famous adagio says,"
"""We don't see things just the way  they are, but the way we are""."
"Without going further,  a while ago I found myself working in a job presentation, totally abstracted from the exterior world and then"
I heard some kind of noise  from the exterior that was telling me
"""Bla-bla-bla the kids..."
Bla-bla-bla tomorrow ...
Bla-bla-bla balls...
"And in that moment I noticed  it was the voice of my wife, Maru, who was staring at me, and saying,"
"""Did you hear what I just said?"""
"""Who?"""
This catch phrases allow me  to gain some time.
"""Yes, yes, you were telling me that...  tomorrow I'll take the kids to school..."
"What happened with the balls?"""
"""See."
"When I speak to you,  you don't listen to me"""
"""Yes, eh..."""
What's all this for?
"OH, IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A BlRTHDAY PARTY!"
YAY!
HAPPY BlRTHDAY TO GENGHlS KHAN'S DESCENDANTS!
"How do I know it's your birthday, Genghis Khan's descendants?"
Because every day is your birthday.
"Because, right now, on the planet Earth, there are 16 million direct descendants of Genghis Khan, meaning that every day is the birthday of 43,000 of them."
"So, good news, Genghis Khan."
"Your empire might be gone, but your progeny lives on, and on, and on, and on."
HAPPY BlRTHDAY!
"Best wishes, John Green."
"Unfortunately for the Mongols, those guys weren't always working together, because Genghis Khan failed to create a single political unit out of his conquests."
"Instead, after Genghis' death, the Mongols were left with 4 really important empires called the Khanates: the Yuan Dynasty in China, the Ilkhanate in Persia, the Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, and the Khanate of the Golden Horde in Russia."
"If you remember all the way back to the Hellenistic period, this is similar to what happened to another good general who wasn't much for administration,"
Alexander the Great.
"Also, neither of them ever conquered India."
"The Mongols succeeded, primarily, because of their military skill."
"Genghis Khan's army, which never numbered more than 130,000, was built on speed and archery, just like this guy."
"Mongol mounted archers were like super-fast tanks, compared to the foot soldiers and knights they were up against."
"""But, wait,"" all the military history nerds are saying,"
"""Once people knew the Mongols were coming,"
"""why didn't they just hole up in castles and forts?"
"""It's not like the Mongols had flying horses."""
EXCEPT THEY DlD.
They didn't?
"Stan, why are you always making history boring?!"
"So the Mongols apparently didn't have flying horses, but they were uncommonly adaptable."
"So even though they'd never seen a castle before they started raiding, they became experts at siege warfare by interrogating prisoners."
"And, they also adopted gunpowder, probably introducing it to Europeans, and they even built ships so they could attack Japan."
"That might have worked, too, except there happened to be a typhoon."
"Also, people were terrified of the Mongols."
"Often, cities would surrender the moment the Mongols arrived, just to escape slaughter."
They used to dream  about cacao beans all night and talk about them all day.
"You had only to mention the word ""cacao""  to an Oompa-Loompa and he would start dribbling  at the mouth."""
Listen closely:
"""The cacao bean,""  Mr Wonka continued,"
"""which grows on the cacao tree, is the thing that all chocolate is made from."""
"Roald Dahl knew,  and it was in the book, the great book  ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."""
Remember the Oompa Loompas.
This is an elf with a cacao pod but the sculpture is 3000 years old.
It is intrinsic to the magic of chocolate.
"In Mexico, this is where the great cuisine was innovated, it was always served as a drink,  but today we have blenders."
It makes it so much easier.
"You can upgrade your smoothie, your protein shake  by adding a dash of raw cacao and bringing forth the magic and wonder, just as they did in Ancient Mexico."
"On the Mexican 100 peso note,  if you look closely, right there next to Xochipilli are actual cacao recipes, iconically represented."
"We've innovated and brought forth now  an entirely new cuisine, brought to the greatest chefs  in the world, revive some of the great additives  of chocolate, creating these wonderful  and delightful recipes."
"The one question that I get more than any other, after all of this is:"
Is it possible to o.d. on chocolate? and the answer is:
Yes.
Thank you so much.
I am David Wolfe.
Have the best day ever.
We continue our Education in America series this morning with one man who is turning the learning process upside down.
"In his series of really simple videos, it's being called revolutionary, as CBS News correspondent"
John Blackstone reports:
It would be music to the ears of any educator what ten-year old Megan Tsern has to say about her favorite teacher.
He makes math really easy in a really kind of conversational way.
He is Salman Khan.
Negative seven dollars?
It's like saying that
I own seven dollars!
"Khan is the voice and the brain behind the Khan Academy, the free educational website that some believe is leading a revolution in teaching!"
"There's no nonsense, no defocusing on the material."
It really is what it is.
Google are among the big donors that have allowed the Khan Academy to add nearly a dozen software engineers.
It's really smartly done on the computer.
And I love being on the computer!
"With more than 2,000,000 users a month, many others seem to love Khan's lesssons, too!"
"I've already taught 70,000,000 lessons!"
And he will be happy to teach millions more.
John Blackstone.

"Mountainview, California."
We launched our own Open Culture Data competition in June 2012... ...after the succes of winning the Apps for the Netherlands competition.
We set up our own competition with three goals for developers.
"Firstly, use Open Culture Data to increase the audience reach and use of this data - online, offline and on site."
"Secondly, connect different datasets."
"Many of are separated, even though they have related information."
"Thirdly, make innovative new apps or websites with Open Culture Data."
There were four awards for the developers... ...three Open Culture Data prizes and one special Dutch National Archives prize.
"We promoted... ...the competition during two large-scale hackathons in June and October, and a smaller one in December... ...and by giving presentations at developer gatherings and at conferences."
"The competition closed on December 31, 2012."
And on 1 January it turned out 27 apps were submitted for the competition.
The Open Culture Data award ceremony took place in January.
The jury consisting of a mix of heritage professionals and copyright specialists chose the four winners.
The winner was the Muse app by No strings.
It's an iPad app in which you can rearrange parts of paintings to make a new artwork.
The second prize went to Histagram by Richard Jong of Frontwise.
On this website you can personalize press photos of the Dutch National Archives and send them to friends.
Bronze was won by SimMuseum by Hay Kranen.
In this game you are a museum director and can trade artworks with other museums.
The Dutch National Archives award was won by Tijdbalk.nl from Arjan den Boer.
With this app you can make your own timeline by combining different data sources on the same subject.
My drive to use open source and open cultural data is that it forces you to think outside the box.
You open up to the unexpected by letting others in on your projects.
If you work closed source you stay on your own island.

"So, the celebrities and all the movie stars and music people, they look amazing, right?"
"They have beautiful skin, white straight teeth, and gorgeous hair."
What do they use?
"Well, I know what they use."
"That's right, some of the companies and I, we've worked together and found out exactly what these celebrities and movie stars and all these famous people are using and I have some of those products to share with you today."
"So what I have is iLike, so if it's good enough for the queen, I say it's good enough for me and you."
"Queen Latifah, Rich Carrot Mask, that is what she uses."
"It is a great mask for anti-aging, to give you antioxidants."
"I mean, if you know how good carrots are for you internally, just imagine what those carotenes are doing for your skin on external, so the iLike Rich Carrot Mask works good enough for Queen Latifah;"
I think we can try it.
And Epicuren's Skincare...
Kate Bosworth loves herself some X-Treme Cream SPF45.
"This is one of my favorites, and I'm gonna keep using this in the wintertime, because, when I go to the park, even though it's winter, we still need to wear sunscreen, okay?"
"I know some of you are thinking, ""Oh, believe me, I don't need it where I live,"" but, most likely, you do."
"Even if it's cloudy out, there's still rays that are getting through, so wear sunscreen."
I'm always gonna preach that.
"And I love this as well, this is off my bathroom counter."
"Again, Epicuren Kukui Coconut After Bath Moisturizer."
This is loved by Gwen Stafani and we all know that she looks amazing.
"This is a body product, so a lot of body products are just hydating/nourishing-type products."
"Well, this, the difference is Epicuren's After Bath has anti-aging ingredients in it, so you're putting on anti-aging moisturizer on your body, which, those of us know, our arms, our shoulders, our neck, our décolleté probably could use some of that."
"And, Kim Cattrall, she loves Epicuren."
"She, you can quote her on this, she uses Epicuren Skin Regime at least once a week, a full Epicuren Skin Regime."
"I have the Ultra Rose in my hand, and this is an amazing moisturizer, super-super hydrating, as well."
Love Epicuren.
"Image Skincare, a lot of movie stars are starting to use this product more and more."
It's getting really popular.
They're coming up on the Beverly Hills Housewives.
"Meryl Streep and Kevin Bacon were in a movie together called ""The River Wild."""
"Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were in ""The Devil Wears Prada"" together."
"And Anne Hathaway and Julia Roberts were in ""Valentines Day."""
We're going to do this as a little bit of a quiz so I'm going to mark each of these edges as something that you need to visit.
You need to visit all of them.
I strongly suggest that you actually check them off as you go because it's really easy to do one twice or forget one by accident.
"So this is what I want you to do, I want you to go through and start at Meryl Streep and move along the green lines here at the movies and each time you visit a movie, check it off as you go."
So the right answer in this quiz is to have all the edges checked off and none of them checked off twice.
"It's really easy to mess that up, so be very careful."
"And then when you're done, I want you to mark the little bubble corresponding to which actor you end up with at the end of your path."
You can follow any path that you want--you just have to make sure that you visit each of the movies once.
All right!
I'd like you to actually go and do this and check off the actor that you end up with.

"Our first speaker is Jack Miller from OlSE,"
"Ontario Institute for Studies in Education at the University of Toronto, who has been involved for many years teaching holistic education and more recently,  mindfulness in particular."
"But let me just say, more complete  biographies of each our speakers, you will find it in your booklet."
"So, you can read that in your leisure time."
Here are some interesting things about them that are not necessarily  in their biographies.
Jack.
"(Jack Miller) Thank you Richard,  it is an honor to be here."
I believe this retreat  could have tremendous influence on education in North America.
"And I have worked in Ontario  for 40 years and this could also have huge impact  on this province, the education."
"So, thank you for coming."
We were asked to share a little bit  about personal story.
I am a child of the 1960s.
"As a young American, I was facing the dilemma of the Vietnam war."
"The more I read about that war, I felt  it was wrong for America to be involved."
So I had the choice when I was drafted that I went to Canada.
"The stress of that time, was when I began my spiritual practice."
"So, in 1969, I started doing yoga and I could feel the effects immediately."
"So I got interested in the philosophy  behind the yoga, and I started reading on Eastern thought."
"Then in 1974, I started  doing Vipassana meditation."
I have been doing those things since those years.
"When I was doing the meditation, one of the things about the experience of meditation is that you begin to experience interconnectedness which Thay calls interbeing."
You experience it at deeper level  than just intellectually.
So this is what eventually lead me to holistic education.
Because holistic education  is about interconnectedness.
"And unfortunately, our education system is very fragmented."
"We break things into courses, into pieces, into little bits of information."
"This basically causes suffering, this fragmentation."
"So, holistic education is an attempt  to have a curriculum that is connected."
So I wrote a book called The Holistic Curriculum which is about that.
"There is a school in Toronto, it is originally called Whole Child School now called the Equinox Holistic School."
We have some teachers here from that school.
I was delighted to run into Kyle.
"From then on we danced together, no matter where or when; waiting for the underground or the bus stop."
"And we are still like that today after 10 years that when we are going to a dance, we just walk faster"
We just want to arrive and start dancing!
"Unconventional, without prejudice and full of life energy; Lindy Hop is more than just a dance!"

"This is Crash Course World History and, today, we're going to discuss, wait for it, the Mongols!"
(wild galloping music)
So you probably have a picture of the Mongols in your head.
"Yes, that's the picture."
"Brutal, bloodthirsty, swarthy, humorously mustachioed warriors riding the plains, wearing fur, eating meat directly off the bone, saying, ""Bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar, bar."""
"In short, we imagine the Mongol Empire as stereotypically barbarian, and that's not entirely wrong."
"But, if you've been reading recent World History textbooks,"
"like we here at Crash Course have, you might have a different view of the Mongols, one that emphasizes the amazing speed and success of their conquests."
How they conquered more land in 25 years than the Romans did in 400.
How they controlled more than 11 million contiguous square miles.
"And, you may even have read that the Mongols basically created nations"
"like Russia, and even Korea."
One historian has even claimed that the Mongols smashed the feudal system and created international law.
"Renowned for their religious tolerance, the Mongols, in this view, created the first great free trade zone,"
like a crazy medieval Eurasian NAFTA.
"And, that's not entirely wrong either."
"Stupid truth, always resisting simplicity."
(upbeat lively music playing)
So remember herders?
"We talked about them, back in Episode 1, as an alternative to hunting and gathering or agriculture."
Here are the key things to remember.
1.
Nomads aren't Jack Kerouac.
They don't go on random road trips.
They migrate according to climate conditions so they can feed their flocks.

"Yes,of course"
Where are you from?
I'm from Holland.
Does technology influences your daily life?
"If, in everything that surrounds me."
Do you think that technology is important to survive or could you live without it?
"Not survive without it, it has become a necessity."
What kind of technology do you use?
"Mobile phone, tablet, gaming consoles, computer, and music player etc."
Do you dependent on some technology?
"If, to communicate with other people"
Do you know use social networks?
"Yes, are very simple to use"
How do you think the world has changed thanks to technology ?
"Technology has completely changed the way of life of the people, how they work, how they speak, and its needs changed."
Is all thanks for your time.
"Ellen Langer, as we move increasingly towards an information society away from muscle power increasingly to brain power, how to think how to learn."
"Yet, you've introduced the concept of ""mindfulness"" that really challenges what is the most effective way of learning."
"Walk us through what the basic principles of what ""mindfulness"" are."
"I think the best way to understand it is to realize that all that we've learned and the way that we've learned how to learn teach us to search for ""certainty."""
Because then you think you know it.
"Uh huh -- but ""certainty"" leads to ""mindlessness."""
"That once you know something so well, that you don't have to look at it again, you don't know it all... because things are constantly changing."
"And essentially mindfulness is the act of drawing the distinctions, noticing the novelty."
A morning conversation with Andrew Feldmar
"In Vancouver, from where I've just arrived, a woman was being beaten and raped on the street a few weeks ago."
"It took place in a public place in broad daylight; and they were surrounded by a lot of people, who were simply watching them."
"Worse yet, those people were taking pictures of the attack; and the pictures were posted online within 15 minutes."
But nobody!
Nobody came to the lady's aid.
"Well, this is the comparison I see:"
"Agi Gereb is in prison, and life goes on as if nothing has happened."
Control
Over Life and Death
Bio-politics is exactly that
In those situations when I feel weakest: at the time of birth and death; when I lose my sanity or turn ill
"Who, besides me, will make decisions about my life in those situations?"
"It is unregulated; it is absolutely out of control at the moment But not only here, it is that way everywhere."
Instant Fashion
"Insurance companies want a kind of psychotherapy, which would heal us in three, four, five hours at most."
"Speed and efficiency are our newest fashions, and they are often tied to things that are good."
"But, then again Is it better to make love fast than doing it slow?"
Space
Time
Control
"The ancient Greeks had two words for time, one was called 'Kronos', which is our 'clock time' and the other is 'Kairos'."
Kairos is the point in time at which apricot ripens.
"The answer to the question 'When will we harvest the apricot?' is not 'Friday at five', but rather 'When it ripens'."
"Kronos was a giant, who ate his own children."
So even the ancient Greeks knew that measuring time with a clock is cruel.
It is absolutely cruel.
"Therefore, it is utterly cruel to speed up the birth process or induce it without waiting for the moment when the 'apricot ripens'."
Love and gentleness can never be effective in such regard.
When my daughter was born - our second child - the doctor was impatient to leave on a sailing trip; and he accused my wife of having a 'lazy uterus'.
He found it much too slow.
"And of course, he gave her Oxytocin and she was made to push the baby out very quickly."
You loved me and I frozen in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
"But I can't compete with the she-wolf, who has brought me to my knees"
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
I'm falling to pieces I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces Falling to pieces
"Did she lie and wait Was I bait, to pull you in"
"The thrill of the kill You feel, is a sin"
"I lay with the wolves Alone, it seems,"
I thought I was part of you
You loved me and I frozen in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
"But I can't compete with the she-wolf, who has brought me to my knees"
What do you see in those yellow eyes?
'Cause I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces Falling to pieces
Professor Charles Bailyn:
"Okay, here's the plan for today."
I want to do one last foray into relativity theory.
"And this is going to be a tricky one, so I hope you're all feeling mentally strong this morning."
"If not, we--gosh, we should have ordered coffee for everyone."
"And, in so doing, I want to introduce one key concept, and also answer at least three of the questions that you guys have asked before in a more--in more depth, and also relate the whole thing back to black holes."
"And then, having done that, we'll have some more questions."
"And then, having done that, I want to get back to astronomy; that is to say, to things in the sky that actually manifest these relativistic effects."
"So, that's where we're going today."
"And along the way, as I said, we'll deal with some of the questions you've been asking in a deeper kind of way."
"In particular--so, questions."
Watch out for the answers to these questions.
No rumours were published.
"I know that sounds obvious, but it's not as easy as it sounds [laughter]."
"It's not that easy, and no rumours were published."
"The only rumour that was heard one day was whether something had happened to a kid in Barcelona, but they immediately rectified... that is if they actually ever published it."
"They said over and over that nothing had happened, and asked people not to spread rumours."
"And in the end, everything works through soft leadership, where anyone can do what they want as long as it's inspired in the collective, very interesting projects appear."
"Take the Square, the 15-O (october) from the beginning, Stop Evictions as a warning and alert platform when there are evictions..."
"Things start to happen that transcend the traditional strategy of communication in social movements, and they transcend the strategy of political communication of any self-respecting political organization, they would love to have the richness of communication that the 15M had."
ST:
"Not related to what you've been talking about just now, although maybe it does form part of it, I'd like you to tell me what has the 15M done wrong?"
JL:
(thinking)
I don't know what to say... because to personify it's hard.
What has the 15M done right?
"15M, since I'm convinced it doesn't move..."
ST:
I define the 15M as a state of mind.
JL:
Exactly.
You could say that the 15M is a state of mind.
But I understand what you're saying.
"The black spots, right?"
ST:
Yes.
Things that weren't pretty?
"There have been obvious mistakes, others less obvious, some of them that you have experienced..."
JL:
I understand the problem with the media.
"I understand perfectly the grudge, or if you prefer another word"
less contemptuous: the indignation against the media.
That indignation can't disappear in three days.
There is damage that the media has done in the poverty of everything.

Everyone has something at their core that they're really upset about.
And here at least it seems that it's all molding together to be like a structural change.
That's what people have been working on.
That's what the general assemblies are here.
"That's why the working groups are forming, so that people can go into a specific corner like sanitation or environmental, or whatever, and start forming their own demands."
Right now we're just practicing first aid on people.
"You know, some people are hurting their feet, or, you know, hurting their ankles, we give out ice packs and stuff, but that's really all we're allowed to do."
"And if we feel someone needs to go the the hospital, we'll call for them and send them there."
"These medical supplies came from all over the country, people donated them."
We got a big shipment in on Tuesday.
"You know, they really sent a lot of stuff, which was, like, heartwarming."
This is the comfort station.
"Essentially we provide warm, dry cloththing, tents, blankets, we have men's socks, women's socks, men's shirts, women's shirts, men's pants, women's pants, umbrellas, tarp, everything to keep everyone comfortable while they're camping out here."
"Makes no sense that one percent of the population owns sixty percent of the wealth,"
"It makes no sense that people are trying to live the American dream and they go to college, and kids are knee-deep in debt, and they can't find jobs, so that's why I'm here."
We're basically feeding everyone.
"(shouts, claps)"
"Hello, everyone, my name is Jonathan, and I am from Taiwan."
My project starts with my friend Jack.
"My friend Jack couldn't see, and he wants to know how people around him ""look"" like."
"How his friends, his family look like, but he was too shy to ask, so I designed little invitation cards that he could give to his family, or to his classmates, to his teachers, and to his friends."
"To tell them that he wants to feel their faces, and see if they accept it."
"Through the project,"
"I learned that it is the first time that Jack ever touched his mother's face, and I am very touched, and by the same time I feel very warm."
"And I think there are many people like Jack out there, so I printed more cards, and I spread them out to other organizations."
"We hope to help more people, and this is my story."
Thank you.
"(claps, shouts)"
"Hi, everyone, my name is Danielle, and I am form Guadalajara, Mexico."
I am here to share my story about
"""The Kilometer of Love,"" my project."
"Well, it all starts well..."
"I invented the project, so that we can help our children that have cancer from all around the world, so that they have better medications, and so that they could live a better life."
"And I believe that this program, it can help everyone, it showed me to never give up, no matter what the problem is, and that we can all make a difference, even someone like me, and we do it all from the heart, thank you."
"[claps, shouts]"
"Hello, I'm Katelyn Freedberg from Pearl River,"
"New York, and my classmates and I did a project."
"We tried to prevent bullying from happening in our school, because it's a big problem, and we wanted everyone in the school to have someone there for them when they need help, so we decided to have ADDvertisements instead of regular advertisements because they subtract from us."
"But we wanted to add something to someone's life, so, yeah."
"Our ADDvertisements were posters that display positive messages, such as ""Kindness doesn't cost anything"","
"""Be a friend not a bully"", and ""This is a bully-free zone""."
And we display these messages throughout the school.
"As soon as our peers began to understand what these messages meant, words began to turn into actions, and soon enough you couldn't find anyone who is lonely at lunch table, everyone have someone there for them."
"So, thank you."

The first sight of Pyongyang is pretty dismal.

We're in a hotel that's about 47 stories tall.
"Off-topic but, if that quote rings a bell, it might be because Oliver Stone blatantly plagiarized"
"Genghis Khan in the movie, ""Conan The Barbarian."""
2.
Is an extension of 1.
The Mongols were seriously brutal conquerors.
"I mean, not uniquely brutal, but still ..."
"The Mongols often destroyed entire cities, and most historians estimate the number they killed to be in the millions."
3.
Their empire didn't last.
"Within 80 years they'd left China and been replaced by a new dynasty, the Ming."
"And, in Persia, they blended in so completely that, by the 15th century, they were totally unrecognizable."
"I mean, they'd even taken up agriculture!"
Agriculture!
The last refuge of scoundrels who want to devote their lives to working instead of [skoodillypooping]!
4.
They also weren't particularly interested in artistic patronage or architecture.
"I mean, your palace may last forever, but my yurt can go anywhere."
5.
The Mongols were probably responsible for the Black Death.
"By opening up trade, they also opened up vectors for disease to travel; in the case of the Plague, via fleas infected with Yersinia pestis."
"And, at least, according to one story, the Mongols intentionally spread the plague by catapulting their plague-ridden cadavers over the walls of Caffa in the Crimea."
"While this primitive act of biological warfare might have happened, it's unlikely to be what actually spread the plague."
More likely it was the fleas on the rats in the holds of Black Sea ships that were trading with Europe.
"But, that trade only existed because of the Mongols."
"All right, Stan, one last time - cue the Mongol-tage."
(wild galloping music)
"So the Mongols promoted trade, diversity, and tolerance, and they also promoted slaughter and senseless destruction."
"And, what you think about the Mongols ends up saying a lot about you."
Do you value artistic output over religious diversity?
Is imperialism that doesn't last better or worse than imperialism that does?
"And, are certain kinds of warfare inherently wrong?"
"If you think those are easy questions to answer, then I haven't been doing my job."
There's that blank  space full of tears
Give me love That's enough
I try to write the letters  hundreds of times
But at the end  I rip it apart
Why is love  so heavy for me
I cry all day  Until the day breaks
I don't know if that  sun is the moon
I don't know if  it's night or day
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
"I cry all day the day breaks  Day breaks, day breaks"
Give me love That's enough
...but it's actually Michigan where this is maybe the most stark and the most amazing.
"In Michigan, the new Republican governor is a man named Rick Snyder."
"Rick Snyder does not get a lot of national attention, but boy howdy he ought to."
"What Governor Snyder is doing, I think, tells you, in particular, how clueless the beltway press has been about what is actually happening in the states right now, in Republican politics."
"If you listen to the beltway press, even those who are willing to be critical of the Republicans, they say things like, ""Well real fiscal conservatives would consider raising taxes, as well as cutting spending, to address their state's budget shortfalls""."
That is actually happening in some of these places.
Look what they are trying to do in Michigan.
Rick Snyder has proposed an actual tax increase.
"Michigan has a budget problem, so he's gonna do the,[bell dings] responsible thing. right?"
He's going to raise taxes.
"He's gonna raise taxes on - seniors, and on poor people."
"1.7 billion dollars in tax hikes for Michigan seniors, and Michigan's poor people, and for people who want to make a tax deductible donation to public universities."
"Sorry, you know, Michigan has a budget problem."
We're gonna hafta raise a whole lotta money from you -
"- poor people, old people, people supporting public schooling - you have to take the hit because the state needs to save that money."
Is the state saving that money?
"No, the state is not."
"Governor Snyder is taking all of that money that the state will gain, and he is not using to close the budget gap."
He is giving it away - in the form of 1.8 billion dollars in corporate tax cuts.
"He's taking in 1.7 billion dollars in higher taxes from poor people and old people, and giving it away."
1.8 billion dollars to businesses.
Dylan:
"Well the founder, Salman Khan, started out by posting lessons for his cousin on YouTube and now the Khan Academy has over a million unique students per month and boasts more than 2,000 tutorials covering everything from basic addition and subtraction to advanced calculus, physics and chemistry and joining us now is Ben Goldhirsh, the CEO of GOOD, it's a company dedicated to moving the world forward through its website, magazine, videos and events."
He thought that Khan was one of the breakout stars at this year's
Technology and Entertainment and Design conference.
"Before we get to all this Khan Academy business Ben, do you like it better when we're on opposite coasts or would you be comfortable if I was to move out to California to spend more time with you?"
Ben:
"I would love to have you out here Dylan, I think we do better in person."
Dylan:
And do you feel that you speak on behalf of the entire southern California community when you welcome me into that universe?
Ben:
The thoughtful ones.
Dylan:
(laughs) Okay the thoughtful ones.
We won't get into how many thoughtful ones there are but we will get into this.
Why did you decide to feature this so prominently with GOOD?
Ben:
"For the past two years, GOOD and University of Phoenix have been focusing on solutions in this education space and we haven't seen anything like it and to contextualize the findings for you, look at Los Angeles."
"We have Teach for America, we have City Year, we have KlPP Academy."
The best of the best of social innovators but they're facing a serious problem.
"600,000 students in LAUSD with a 50 percent graduation rate."
"That's terrifying and the bottom line is the solutions that we have on the ground, in my opinion, aren't going to catch this problem."
"We need a disruptive technology, we need to really revolutionize how we're tackling this."
Khan Academy is the first thing I've seen that gives me confidence that we're going to tackle it.
"It's the most exciting thing I've seen that we're doing to do this so I'm pleased to bring it to your show,"
I think we're going to dig into a good conversation.
Dylan:
Alright let's have at it.
"The man behind the idea joins us, Salman Khan."
Founder of the Khan Academy.
High praise for what you've got going from our friend Ben down there in southern California.
"He's a thoughtful southern Californian, is how he likes to refer to himself."
What have you found is the biggest problem with this?
New paragraph
I will leave my contact information in the description of this video.
"Okay, but just that you don't think that I trained Simon specifically for that text, I'm gonna dictate something ... ... from the web as well"
"So, let's actually have a look at The Verge... ... and let's pick the middle one for whatever reason."
And try to dictate that
Let's go ahead
"Google's made good on a promise today, rolling out voice calling through it's hangouts messaging service."
"Basically, it works just like video calling - you can call one person or many with a click of a button in ... ..."
"Google+, Gmail or the Chrome extension, and the whacky Hangouts effects are even in play - except it allows you to call phone numbers."
"You can even mix and match video and voice calling, so your friends without hangouts won't be shut out of your chatting."
"For having desecrated holy territory, exemplary punishment"
Uh... chief?
"You, shut your mouth"
You choose death or tchetche?
Whats tchetche?
Tchetche is....tchetche.
"Then okay, I'll take tchetche."
TCHETCHE!!!
"And you stranger, death or tchetche?"
Uh death...... please.
"Okay, but before that, TCHETCHE!!"
Welcome to the archeology news!
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, tonight we'll travel in time to shed light on an interesting event of past human history."
We'll use a biological time machine: cattle DNA.
The DNA is the code of life.
It contains all the information needed for the correct functioning of living organisms.
"Geneticists represent it as an alphabet, with four letters."
"They are chemical basis, represented as letters."
"These letters and the associated code are transmitted from parents to progeny, across generations."
The DNA duplication machinery is not error free.
Letters may be mistyped and errors transmitted to progeny.
These mutations create the genetic variation that is at the row material shaped by evolution and speciation.
Even in the presence of cycles in our relation.
"This is an important conversation for our children, for our communities, for Democrats, and Republicans .Speaking is difficult but I need to say something important:"
"Violence is a big problem, too many children are dying."
Too many children.
We must do something.
"It will be hard, but the time is now."
You must act.
"Be bold, be courageous,"
Americans are counting on you.
Thank you
"I'm going to start with a quote by the Dalai Lama,"
"""Today, more than ever before,"
"life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility not only nation to nation and human to human but human to other forms of life."""
That's what I'm here to talk about;
"I'm passionate about wildlife conservation, thus, other forms of life."
"In the last ten years, I've done everything I can to learn as much as I can about it."
"I've read books, I've talked to experts,"
"I've gone to conferences, and traveled the world."
I wanted to see for myself what's going on in these places.
"I visited chimpanzees in Uganda,"
I visited mountain gorilla families in Rwanda.
"Everywhere I go, the root cause of the dwindling numbers of these species is human population pressure."
"A recent visual example I saw of this is in Uganda, with farms going up the hillside right to the boundary of Bwindi National Park, part of the last remaining habitat for the mountain gorilla."
Let's talk about population.
"We're at 6.7 billion people in the world today, expected to rise to nine or ten billion just in the next 40 years."
The problem is we've already got a billion people who don't have enough to eat.
"What is it going to be like when we increase the pressure, the human population pressure, by another 50%?"
"So, I think, what we are going to have are more conflicts, more wars over scarcer resources,"
less drinking water per person.
"We're going to have less food per person, more disease, and suffering."
"It's difficult to comprehend, but that's suffering on a global scale when we are talking about billions of people."
I know this is sobering to think about.
"We informed about what was happening in Malaga, Gijon..."
We have been in many cities.
"And I can tell you in Madrid, for example, the work was mainly developed thanks to"
"Jessica Romero, Lidia Molina, also my own work where other people like Leila Nachawati and Olga Roríguez collaborated..."
"The family of Periodismo Humano is large and more or less intensely, depending on each person, we have all collaborated a lot."
With the coordination of Javier and Patricia who made it possible for everything to fit in and make sense.
"But, a normal day of coverage during the 15M, during those first weeks,"
"I would get up late, because the night before"
"I had gone to bed very late, go to the Puerta del Sol, and start talking to people and ask them what they were doing there, who they were, if it was true that they were hippies or radicals or violent... or if it was true that they weren't going to vote, or if they had fleas."
"I don't know, ask them who they were."
And from there lots of interesting things came to light.
"And you spend your day talking to people, listening in on the assemblies to understand what it was all about."
I remember telling one of my co-workers:
"""Get a computer and write down everything we've heard, these are the 15M political proposals""."
"Because someone had decided to read a list of things that they had talked about in an assembly, areas of work."
Areas of work where they would form commissions.
"So at that moment, in my short-minded journalist's brain, I thought that was the headline."
And I asked my co-worker to write it down.
"From that moment until it was published everything calmed down a lot, and fortunately we weren't wrong and we didn't slip up."
But we could have.
Because at that moment you didn't know what we were looking at.
"But our job was to be there 12 or 15 hours with the people, uploading photos and video."
"Not just for the sake of uploading them, but looking for humane details that defined what was happening."
To escape from the freakshow idea.
To escape from the freakshow idea and the exception.
NOT to go up to the wierdest looking man in the square.
Because that didn't define what was going on.
NOT to find the biggest Mohawk haircut.
Because Mohawk haircuts are fine but they didn't define what was going on.
"NOT to go up to someone with a bottle of beer in his hand, that didn't define what was happening in the square."
Just talk to people.
12 hours.
The two connect.
"This year here at the Mechina is a very, very significant year."
It creates a real revolution among these young men.
"And slowly but gradually, through all the experiences and laughs, you see how these kids stabilize, kids who walked around with a kipa, but with spikes underneath with all the gel in their hair etc.."
"The hair slowly but gradually gets shorter, they begin to dress differently"
like a Talmid Chacham.
Something stabilizes within them.
Two words the Mechina gave me:
Torah and Life.
"As far as I'm concerned, they are both the exact same thing."
The Mechina brought Torah into my life.
It totally changed my life.
I understood this at the Mechina itself which was one of the most significant things I've ever done.
I think that only after looking at the long-term will I be able to see just how significant and essential it impacted my life.
"After a year-and-a-half at the Mechina,"
"I received not only direction, but also serious momentum to begin life in the best way possible."
"Our spiritual situation when we came here wasn't exactly ""up there"", and had we enlisted directly into the army, we would have absolutely experienced [spiritual] burnout."
The Mechina saved us.
"Thank G-d, we see amazing success at the end of the year when we see the same student who, was began the year with an earring, and at the end of the year before enlisting in the IDF, the student makes a Siyum Masechet/concludes a book of Talmud and with this Siyum he enlists in the IDF in a combat unit, nonetheless!"
Amazing!
"""Magic"", perhaps, but I call it ""Divine Assistance""..."
"I became so attached to this place that the decision to get married happened right over here, on the steps."
"I came here with my wife, even after the Mechina had already moved elsewhere."
I took her to these steps and we talked and I felt my best in this place
I felt here the most confident to tell her that I want to marry her that I love her and want to build a Jewish home at the very place which helped me know what a Jewish home is...
I'm carrying around the centre of Europe. i like the idea very much.
"Lisboa, it's the centre of good food, good nightlife."
"- Open to the world, to multiple cultures."
"- Its' kind of becoming the centre of cultural evolution, in its own way."
"- And I think it can be the centre of Europe, because it captures the European culture."
- This is Lisbon: ... open-hearted.
- The centre of Europe?
Some people just have the ability to get people on their side.
They have good reasons.
They know how to explain things well.
They're just naturally persuasive.
They can sell things effectively.
They just have that persuasive power.
And that's a form of power as well.
"Well so now what we've done, we've gone through norms, we've talked about status and power."
These are all important ingredients.
"Hopefully you'll be aware of these, look for these and try to use them constructively too in your own group dynamics."
And I wish you the best in doing that.
"Stop the disco music, it steals our jobs, the Musicians' union says -"
- who demands a special disco fee and that discotheques shouldn't be allowed to serve alcohol.
Disco music on grammophone is competing dance orchestras to death.
The Musician's union now tries to save the live music by demanding a special disco fee -
- and retracted liquor license for restaurants who abandon live music for disco.
Every month one dance orchestra here in Sweden dies and the lines of musicians waiting for unemployment benefits are growing. ♪ I am a giant tree. ♪
"Janne Landegren, finalist in the Swedish Eurovision song contest qualifier two years ago -"
"- and vocalist in Telstars, one of the most wellknown dance orchestras in Sweden."
But now Telstars has disbanded.
The latest victim to the death of dance orchestras and Janne Landegren is going to the office for unemployment benefits.
-It feels tough to have to disband a group like Telstars.
"Not just because it affects me personally, economically."
-And your family?
-And my family economically to say the least.
"It also feels hard to disband a group like Telstars that have existed since 1963, for 16 years."
The Musicians' union forces so called live music upon us.
This is live music if there is such a thing.
"Today this type of public usage is totally unregulated.For example we can listen in department stores, elevators, sports arenas and discotheques."
This without any compensation to the musician who is the person actually performing.
We can't accept that.
The disco fee hasn't been decided but today the Swedish broadcasting corporation pays 32 SEK for every minute of record music played.
And last but not the
"least, in order to give you the chance to get a question to Mr. Schmidt, please raise your hand."
We have ladies on each side of the stage with a microphone in their hands and we will guide the microphones to you.
"Once you have the microphone, please get up, state your name and your outlet and start shooting the question."
I think that's basically all.
The Q&amp;amp;A section will probably be limited to about 10 minutes.
"Ladies and gentlemen, so please give a warm welcome to the COO of the Messe Berlin, Dr. Christian Goke."
Welcome.
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; GOKE:
"Thank you, Steven."
"Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon."
"Usually, when I'm standing"
"here in front of you trying to kick off the keynote, I'm either trying to present the speaker, or the company, or I'm trying to give a short summary of what have happened so far at our show."
"Today, there's obviously no need at all either to introduce the speaker or the company."
"And on the other hand, our show is running so smoothly, we are hitting new record numbers that there is time--very little time for a very brief observation."
Most of you--as you do know by now that our show started in 1924.
"1924, that was only six years after the end of the First World War; and in 1929, after some years of Europe again blossoming and a period that was later on called the Golden 20s, in 1929, the party abruptly stopped; Wall Street crashed."
"And one year later in 1930, almost to the day 80 years ago, Albert Einstein himself delivered his first keynote to our show here in Berlin; another radio talk."
"And then again only three years later in 1933, Hitler's Nazi regime came into power."
"So, what I'm going to say is, this was a very special moment in time when he delivered his first keynote here in 1930, 80 years ago."
"And what he said in essence was, ""Technology enables communication and communication enables democracy."" And I think"
that this statement is more valid today than ever before.
And it should really remind us that every new means of communication has a direct impact on our political system.
"So,"
"ladies and gentlemen, I'm reasonably sure that Albert Einstein somewhere up there is watching us and he is looking forward as much as we are to the closing keynote of IFA 2010 given by the chairman of the board and the CEO of Google."
"But before we start; film up, roll on the movie please. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Now, our lives are changing fast."
"Now, our lives are changing fast."
Hope that something pure can last.
Hope that something pure can
last.
We used to wait.

Failure of the knee to adduct is a positive test.

"I'm just very quickly going to cover the Safe Harbor statement, and then turn it over to Mary and Eric."
"So, before we begin, I would like to note that our comments and answers to questions may contain forward-looking statements regarding Google's business outlook."
Our actual results may differ from those made in any forward-looking statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties.
These risks are detailed in our public filings with the FCC.
"Also, please note that a web case replay of this session will be available on our investor relations web site in a few hours."
"We routinely post important information on our investor relations web site,"
"located at investor.google.com, and we encourage you to make use of that resource."
"So, with that, I'll turn it over to Mary. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"

Two of the victims were former members of the Auburn University football team.
Auburn police chief Tommy Dawson announced the deaths.
"""It's sickening that these young lives were cut short, and, and also the shooter is such a young man."
"As a society, we've got to learn the value of life again."
"If I could bring them back today to their parents, I would."
"Fortunately, I can't do that."
"And to the parents and families of these victims, I am very sorry."
"Please let it be known, we are grieving with you"

And a group of Latin musicians has won a campaign for the Grammy Awards to reinstate the category of Best Latin jazz album following its elimination last year.
Latin jazz was among dozens of ethnic music award categories cut from the annual event by the Recording Academy in a controversial move.
"Last August, four Latin jazz artists filed a lawsuit with the New York Supreme Court claiming that the dropping of such categories had adversely affected their careers."
"The suit was dismissed in April, but after continued campaigning the Recording Academy announced the award's reinstatement on Friday."
"Hello, my name is Karen Peltz Strauss."
I grew up in NY
I have a family of three boys and one husband.
"The ""Dirty Jobs"" crew and I were called to a little town in Colorado, called Craig."
It's only a couple dozen square miles.
It's in the Rockies.
And the job in question was sheep rancher.
"My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple."
"I'm an apprentice, and I work with the people who actually do the jobs in question."
"And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people, for one day in their life."
The job in question: herding sheep.
Great.
We go to Craig and we check in to a hotel and I realize the next day that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.
"So, normally, I never do any research at all."
"But, this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel, and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do, and we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals."
"So I called the Humane Society and I say, ""Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs,"
"Can you tell me the deal?"""
"And they're like, ""Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."""
"They use a band -- basically a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller."
"But in fact, this man has a wonderful  relationship with the young people because he is completely comfortable with  who he is and he is completely authentic."
"And these young people  feel his authenticity and his authenticity allows them to be their true selves."""
"And that is the most important, not the differences, but the authenticity."
"(Woman in the audience) Hello,"
I work in French and American schools.
"I do intervention, teaching meditation and yoga but I usually talk to the children, not so much to the teachers or bosses of the schools."
"And basically, I am looking for help and maybe resources to know to speech, to talk to teachers of big school."
"People give you some money, basically, to come in to the school."
I am also looking for resources  to translate all the mindfulness that we learn in English in French.
(Inaudible)
(J. Bell) I wonder if anybody in the hall could answer her.
"Raise your hand  if you have some resources and then you could speak to her afterwards, okay?"
(Inaudible)
Someone back there too.
(M. Srinivasan) I also wanted to mention that collaborative academic social  emotional learning has a great resource.
"They have five competencies that  are specific taught sequentially of self awareness, self management,  social awareness, relationship skills and  helping decision making."
"If you just go to www.casel.org, there is a lot of information there including research about improved attention and focus, and students who have social  emotional learning interventions."
The latest report had an increase of 11% top points on testings.
This is all language and information that will be really effective for the administrators too.
"(K. Weare) And also to add, I actually imagine it is very typical."
"The dot-be program in the UK, if you go to it, has a paper  on the evidence based and the curriculum has been translated into French."
"I would imagine if you went  to the Garrison website and looked the various programs there, you would find quite a lot of resources."
There are 37 programs.
"If you start clicking, you will find stuff, I'm sure."
"(M. Srinivasan) Richard suggests that I spell 'casel', it is C-A-S-E-L dot org."
And they also have the evidence based  programs up there and research as well.
"(K. Weare) It is in the UK, it is called the Mindfulness in Schools Program."
There is free download of a paper only evidence-based from mindfulness in school.
"It is just called Mindfulness in Schools, if you put UK, you'll find it, and it's called .b which  is a full-stop with the small 'b'."
"It means basically stop and breathe or stop and be, that's its logo."
But I think the Garrison will also  have some evidence-based papers.
"So, there are quite a lot around  if you start google-ing."
"We're gonna start off by playing some kerbals space program then continue to outlast, so join the fun."

"Hello, my name is Maryanne."
And my name is Ashley.
We are seniors here at Western illinois University.
Majoring in Instructional Design and Technology.
"Also, known as IDT."
Something I really enjoy about our majors the opportunity to be working with the latest technology.
"As well as, experience such diverse and unique careers depending on what we want to do and where we want to go."
"In the IDT field you can focus your future working with government, business, health, military or the educational setting."
It really has no limit where you want to extend this career.
IDT involves learning to use technology to effectively design training and educational material.
Did you know that IDT department is just one of the few departments in the nation?
"In fact, we are the only school in the Midwest to offer a bachelors degree in IDT."
"Also, in the Chicago area alone there is 141 job offerings."
Let's talk about what this field can offer for your future career opportunities.
As Maryanne mentioned before the IDT department offers a variety of career opportunities that are diverse.
"You can pursue careers in government, heath, business, military and educational setting."
These are a few companies that our previous graduates had the opportunity to work with.
Our IDT department offers hands-on learning lesson and experiences from highly world dedicated professors.
"Why don't you take a moment to take a look at the IDT see all the different resources, as well as, the two options of study our department has to offer."
I choose the medium web base development option.
The section of study I love the formal based learning with focus of online course development.
And I choose the games and simulation option.
This option of study is a learn by doing approach.
"""This isn't a party and we're not here for fun."
"We have a problem and we have to solve it like this and this and this"", with a very coded language, a very traditional political narrative, very endogamic..."
"And suddenly the square and the internet is full of messages that deactivate any assault that they can set on you from the outside, and they deactivate the social depression we're in."
Suddenly the people were happy.
There were marvellous phrases.
"I can't remember any right now have a terrible memory, but they're in the archives."
There are people doing a great job archiving material and in 30 years we can look over the jokes and irony of 2011.
For me Twitter is irony.
Except when you have thousands of followers and you can't say anything because everything can be misunderstood and they make a #whatshisnamefacts hashtag and they crush you.
"But when you're in a manageable state, Twitter is pure irony."
And irony works better than any other register.
And soon I saw tweets on banners.
After I'd seen the May '68 book maybe it's the other way around.
But I've laughed so much
All along the walls starting from the underground access gate all full of the most creative messages.
They were also very rich.
And very enrichening.
"Like, even though this goes nowhere, although it comes to nothing, or it doesn't fulfill people's expectations, at least it will have given those who were there a chance to detoxify themselves from the typical political discourse."
"Because it's so boring, political language is so grey and suddenly irony pops up in political language without being demogogical, it's great."
ST:
Even when we have to laugh at ourselves.
There were moments in which I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
"Whether to go or stay... and thanks to the tweets and three posters, I chuckled and was able to go on."
It's curious.
I was marvelled.
"And after a phenomena like this, the satire."
"Like @acampadapolicia, or @putohelicoptero, which is minimalist, but every time I got one of his messages I laughed so much..."
JL: tacatacatacatacatacatacataca...
[laughter]
"There was also a really funny thing that happened whenever I saw a helicopter anywhere in Spain I took a photo and said ""Look! @putohelicoptero is here!"""
Creativity has no limits. @acampadapolicia has made us laugh.
"And that opens so many doors to so many things, so much creativity, you just can't say it's a bad thing."
"April and May were bursting with flowers,"
"July and August were hot and sunshiny, and September and October were a kaleidoscope of colorful leaves."
"It was just the way the world worked, and it was magical."
"If you had told me back then that one-third of Earth's population had never seen snow or that July 4th was most definitely not a beach day,"
I would have thought you were crazy.
"But in reality, seasonal change with four distinct seasons only happens in two regions on the planet."
"And, even in those two, the seasons are reversed."
But why?
A lot of people have heard of an astronomer called Johannes Kepler and how he proved that planetary orbits are elliptical and that the sun is not at the center of the orbit.
It was a big deal when he figured this out several hundred years ago.
His discovery solved a lot of mathematical problems that astronomers were having with planetary orbit measurements.
"While it's true that our orbit's not perfectly circular, those pictures in our science books, on TV, and in the movies give an exaggerated impression of how elongated our orbit is."
"In fact, Earth's orbit is very nearly a perfect circle."
"However, because Earth's orbit is technically an ellipse, even though it doesn't look like one, and the sun isn't quite exactly at the center, it means that our distance from the sun does change through the year."
Ah-ha!
"So, winter happens when the Earth is further away from the sun!"
"Well, no, not so fast."
The Earth is actually closer to the sun in January than we are in July by 5 million kilometers.
January is smack-dab in the middle of the coldest season of the year for those of us up north.
Still not convinced?
How about this:
Summer and winter occur simultaneously on the surface of our planet.
"When it's winter in Connecticut, it's summer in New Zealand."
"So, if it's not the distance from the sun, what else could it be?"
"Well, we need to also need to know that the Earth doesn't sit straight up."
It actually tilts.
And that axial tilt of the Earth is one of the main reasons for the seasons.
The Earth spins on an axis that's tilted 23.5 degrees from vertical.
"At the same time, the Earth revolves around the sun with the axis always pointing in the same direction in space."
"Together with the tilt, the spinning and revolving causes the number of hours of daylight in a region to change as the year goes by, with more hours in summer and fewer in winter."
"So, when the sun is shining on the Earth, it warms up."
"After the sun sets, it has time to cool down."
For a few days at least.
"Because they're pacifists and suddenly they get hit, and they're insulted and they're treated so degradingly and so unnecessarily."
"That makes us really skeptical of the system represented by these policemen, those agents who maltreated them so incredibly."
"So I think it's not very intelligent to let the police, even though it's just a few individuals, to let them do those things."
It's not very intelligent at all.
You're turning people against you.
"Against you as a system, as a state, as whatever."
"I think it's unnecessary, absolutely unnecessary."
"And that night was very unpleasant, and it was unpleasant not to be there to see it and talk about it."
"That day I was on holiday and I didn't go to Madrid, like other times, to the demonstration."
And it was unpleasant not to be there and not to be able to inform about it.
ST:
Let's change topic to something radically different which has helped me to process my emotions.
In my experience of the 15M there's one thing that's really important: humour.
"Whether it's humour in the shape of stories like @putohelicoptero, @acampadapolicia, the posters or even my own tweets."
From time to time I had a kind of humour registry that helped me.
"I'd like you to tell me what you thought about the use of humour within the 15M, and how important it has been."
JL:
The other day I went to a bookshop and I saw on one of the shelves a book of banners from May '68.
I was confused so I took the book and I was surprised to find tweets.
"They were what I would have regarded as great sarcastic phrases for Twitter and banners, very much in line with the 15M."
But suddenly they were there.
"Obviously the cultural and terminological references are different, but there was so much creativity."
"That's for starters, because I remember seeing it the other day."
"And I've laughed so much, from the very beginning in the Puerta del Sol because there were such good phrases."
"Some were devastating, and others were very funny."
"You ended up laughing, copying them down and tweeting them, and sharing them because they're so creative, and the 15M has always considered creativity and humour way above aggresiveness and affiliation."
The richness of so many different messages.
"Some people think they're naive, and that just making jokes is a far cry from organising a revolution."
There are people who think so and say so.
People who think that in the Puerta del Sol there is no party.
"I've heard it in assemblies: ""we're not here to celebrate anything"""
(Applause)
"You know, I have told this story close to 550 times, in audiences in 40 countries, to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth, and every time it hits something."
"Now, if I were to go into the same crowd and say, ""I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"" they would say, ""Thank you very much, we have other things to do."""
And that is the astonishing power of art.
Art can go through where other things can't.
"You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices, breaks through everything that you have as your mask, that says, ""I am this, I am that, I am that."""
No.
It breaks through those.
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
"And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change, we need a language that reaches through."
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
"And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth."
"And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies, and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require, they also know the power of the arts."
For me it came very early.
"When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer, came upon a phenomenon that worried her."
"It was a phenomenon where young brides were committing suicide in rural Gujarat, because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families."
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
"He came to talk to her and said, ""What is this about?"""
She told him and he set out the first inquiry into what today we call Dowry Dance.
Imagine a dance piece for the first inquiry into something that even today kills thousands of women.
"Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook in ""The Mahabharata"" playing this feisty feminine feminist called Draupadi, I had similar experiences."
"Big fat black mamas in the Bronx used to come and say, ""Hey girl, that's it!"""
"And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,"
"""Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça?"
"Ça!"""
"And then aboriginal women in Africa would come and say, ""This is it!"""
"And I thought, ""This is what we need, as a language."""
We had somebody from public health.
And Devdutt also mentioned public health.
"Well, millions of people around the world die of waterborne disease every year."
"And that's because there is no clean water to drink, or in countries like India, people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation."
"So, what do they do?"
I wasn't very good at reading things.
"In fact, I don't read much of anything."
"I am extremely dyslexic, and so reading is the hardest thing I do."
"But instead, I go out and I find things."
Then I just pick things up.
I basically practice for finding money on the street.
(Laughter)
"And I wander about the hills, and I have found a few things."
"And I have been fortunate enough to find things like the first eggs in the Western hemisphere and the first baby dinosaurs in nests, the first dinosaur embryos and massive accumulations of bones."
"And it happened to be at a time when people were just starting to begin to realize that dinosaurs weren't the big, stupid, green reptiles that people had thought for so many years."
People were starting to get an idea that dinosaurs were special.
"And so, at that time,"
I was able to make some interesting hypotheses along with my colleagues.
"We were able to actually say that dinosaurs -- based on the evidence we had -- that dinosaurs built nests and lived in colonies and cared for their young, brought food to their babies and traveled in gigantic herds."
So it was pretty interesting stuff.
I have gone on to find more things and discover that dinosaurs really were very social.
We have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults.
The appearance of them would have been different -- which it is in all social animals.
"In social groups of animals, the juveniles always look different than the adults."
The adults can recognize the juveniles; the juveniles can recognize the adults.
And so we're making a better picture of what a dinosaur looks like.
And they didn't just all chase Jeeps around.
(Laughter)
But it is that social thing that I guess attracted Michael Crichton.
"And in his book, he talked about the social animals."
"And then Steven Spielberg, of course, depicts these dinosaurs as being very social creatures."
"The theme of this story is building a dinosaur, and so we come to that part of ""Jurassic Park."""
Michael Crichton really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life.
"You all know the story, right."
"I mean, I assume everyone here has seen ""Jurassic Park."""
"If you want to make a dinosaur, you go out, you find yourself a piece of petrified tree sap -- otherwise known as amber -- that has some blood-sucking insects in it, good ones, and you get your insect and you drill into it and you suck out some DNA, because obviously all insects that sucked blood in those days sucked dinosaur DNA out."
And you take your DNA back to the laboratory and you clone it.
So in just this little sort of case study of New Haven and
"Yale, you can see how citizenship and"
"leadership came to have different meanings, how people were understanding what they were supposed to be doing as citizens in a different way as they lived the experience of fighting a Revolution."
Okay.
I ended that on time.
I even read my--I'm so impressed with myself--[laughs/laughter] the instant lecture.
Okay.
"And I ended two minutes early, so you have time to get your midterms."
"Have a wonderful spring break, and I will see you after."
"My name is Bacar Fati and I am vice president moreover, I am a founding member of the NGO Senim Mira Nassequê, and I am vice president."
"So, these people have been working from its creation for the training, information and awareness of people to abandon the pratices of... mainly female genital mutilation."
"But there is a broader activity of cutting, in the sense of putting an end to the practices especially with the NGO Saber Bom."
As we know of course that in our country there are many ethnicities that have those practices as part of their culture.
"So, in this moment we are doing a good work with the participation of other NGOs I think we are making an effort in that sense, and we are in the right way."
I am here today to take part of a training so that we can start producing and spreading our activities through blogging news.
"And today it is my second time in this activity so I think I am already learning and I have learned many things that allow us, from Senim Mira, to start spreading information about the activities we are promoting in different parts of the country."
"Right now we are in Bissau, but soon we will have another partnership indeed, the second partnership with the NGO (?) and that will help us a lot on implementing the activities in the field."
How do you show  two and three-digit numbers on a number line?
"In this lesson you will learn how to show numbers on a number line by thinking about hundreds, tens, and ones."
Let's review :
You know you can model 45 using place value tools.
If we used a place value board we know we would need four tens and five ones to show 45.
We can do the same thing with a three-digit number such as 253.
"We would need two hundreds, five tens, and three ones."
Two hundred fifty three.
A common misunderstanding when using number lines is thinking that number line models always count by or use units of one.
If we were to put fifty two on a number line...
Let's see what that looks like.
"Five tens, we know is fifty."
"And, we have two ones..."
Two jumps of... two more jumps?
"One, two."
"I've got a lot of time on my hands, but I don't, you know what I mean?"
"So, anyway... open mic. michaelthomas_2: ...three hours a day Monday through Friday."
"I'm looking at the prices here on Paltalk and Ghost, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you have the premium plan, which cost you $250 a month, or $249 a month."
"That means over four years Ghost spent over $12,000 giving us this time of his life and I didn't get a nap until today but that is a lot of money, man and we really appreciate you doing that for us."
"Well, yeah, $12,000 even for a rich man, that is not a small chunk of change."
That's not somethign you sneeze at.
"No, I really appreciate it man, thank you."
"Well, yeah, he can afford it, that's not the point."
It's still--
Ghost:
"Hey, this is what I""m talking about, man."
"Unappreciative, man."
You can give everything to everybody for free but they don't appreciate a goddamn thing.
"I mean, this is pretty much the synopsis of what people can get from this little Internet exercise here."
All right?
"I mean, this is much like the po' in America."
"You can give them a free house, a free car, a free job, free healthcare, free everything, but you know what?"
"They're still gonna bitch and they're still gonna be like,"
"""Yeah, man."""
GuitarNinja:
"It's a sad fact, but a lot of people are really unappreciative about everything."
"But, you know, I gotta agree with Mike Thomas, a lot of us here are very appreciative of everything you've done and the time, effort, and capital you have put into this."
"I mean, I was a bleeding heart liberal until about January of 2011,"
"I was like, had Occupy started earlier,"
I probably would've been in there and a big part of what kind of changed me into the
"I guess, call me a capitalist, you know, into the capitalist conservative, not conservative, but the kind of person I am now."
"A big part of it was listening to your show and getting the information from someone who wasn't you know, liberally slanting it and you knwo,"
"I definitely appreciate everything and don't ever think that the past couple years have been for no-- you know, there are those of us who are appreciative of it, but it is unfortunate there are a lot of people who aren't."
Never think that you wasted your time or money.
YOu have created a lot of capitalists out of this.
Ghost:
"I appreciate all the kind words in the chatroom, man but I don't see this as a --- you know, I feel bad for the people that really appreciated the show and appreciate what we were trying to do here that , you know, it's a little disappointing for them but it's good for me man, 'cause believe it or not man, my wife always told me taht this was a combination of it, man."
Do you have any advice following the Arab spring that just hit the middle east?
For the rest of black Africa that is still facing some sort of oppression?
"We see a year later what's happening with the Arab Spring and now in the Arab world, in Egypt we see how difficult it is to really allow freedom to take hold, but you've got to start the process."
You can't romanticize or demonize Africa.
You've got to take it for what it is and then engage the larger world and use every resource available to try to change it.
"Well, Dr. King said injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
"So he would have embraced people in the Arab Spring, he'd talk about Occupy Wall Street"
"To hammer home the point that people should not be oppressed, and that we must open the doors of opportunity for all."
His words seem to have the sort of premonition that is so poignant upon every relistening.
"Every time we hear them again, well I don't know what will happen to me now, but it really doesn't matter because I've been to the mountain top."
And you can hear the people responding.
Ha ha!
"And he said I've looked over and I've seen the promised land stretching, seeing out in a melismatic Sam Cooke like [singing] that's old school."
That's for the old people.
Don't worry.
Dr. King would have warned against the kind of vigilant hyperbole that existed in the aftermath of Barack Obama's ascent to the presidency.
From King's assassination to Barack's inauguration
"We know that the impact of King's death is monumental, opening up space for the very conception that the black man could lead this nation."
He also would've been critical of him.
That was his role.
That was his job.
"He was a prophet, not a politician."
Some people think that Barack Obama is Moses when his job description says he's pharoah.
Which means then that you're in the business of occupying political space to bring about the greatest outcome for the most citizens in your nation.
That means compromise in a way that prophets find problematic.
I think that Dr. King would have been deeply troubled by the persistence of inequality and he would've pushed rather vigorously for the relief of the most vulnerable in our society.
Neither the democrats of republicans speak about poverty.
They keep talking about the middle class like everybody middle class.
There are millions of poor people in this nation!
And Martin Luther King Jr. loved them and died with poor people!
Martin Luther King Jr. opened up this rhetorical resistance to American culture.
At its best hip hop tells the truth.
Although one of them has been mildly successful in early stage of Alzheimer's.
"So, clearly, Alzheimer's therapy has a very long way to go."
Next time we will continue or discussion of neurodegenerative diseases by talking about Parkinson's disease.
"Here's another nearest neighbor example, and now I'm going to ask a different question."
"Given all the black data points,"
I want to make sure that the red ones are classified as indicated and I am free to choose a different value for K.
"Say I can choose K to be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9."
Check any or all of the K values for which you believe these 3 data points are classified correctly relative to the black training data set.
"In the celebrated example of Prisoner's Dilemma, we have this general scheme where the two prisoners can either cooperate or not."
"Defect, as it's called."
"If they both cooperate, they get some payoff A."
"If they both defect, they get a different payoff D, where A is greater than D."
"However, if they miscoordinate and one of them cooperates and the other defects, then the cooperator gets the lowest possible payoff and the defector gets the largest possible payoff."
And that's true symmetrically here as well.
And this very well known example has a rather counterintuitive paradoxical properties.
Most games are not as conceptually confusing.
Here's an example that's conceptually very clear and these are games of pure competition.
"The situation here is limited to two players, where one player's payoff is exactly the compliment of another player's payoff."
"So, they always add to some constant c."
Often that constant we use is zero.
"And we call it, for that reason, zero sum games, as opposed to constant sum games."
"And since they do sum to zero or to a constant, we only need to remember one number, the pair to one of these and we can infer the payoff to the other player from that."
Here's the most simple version of it.
This is a game of matching pennies.
So you and I each need to pick heads or tail for the coin.
"If we pick the same side, either heads or tails, I win."
Which means that I get a payoff of one and you have minus one.
"If we miscoordinate, and so I pick heads and you tails or the other way around, then you win."
A very straight forward game of pure competition.
"Here's another very well known similar game with three actions from both of us and that's the game of rock, papers, and scissors, also known as rochambo."
"So, if we pick the same action then it's a draw."
And otherwise there are rules for who wins.
Q: what are the obligations of GAP up nowadays?
A:
"Gap is based on reach middle school and recently, we also open with universities."
"Our core is in Fortaleza, Sobrau, Joào Pessoa, and Moçorò."
"Gap exists to create a means by which the Church can exercise his vocation, exercising the gifts that we have received by the grace of God."
"Therefore, this passion allows us to to influence young people, which nowadays are continually bombarded by the sinful seductions of this modern era and help them maintain their fire for Christ."
This helps them a lot.
"So we're on the road with tent giving space to the work of Christ bearing witness of lives transformed, the recovery of those who have gone astray, and in rebellion to God."
Q: how long are you in business?
A:
By 12 years.
Q: how's the dialogue with the Church?
A: it is difficult.
We are sometimes hesitant.
"Unfortunately there are many churches where leaders are interested in other things, thus deluding their members ... so we are sometimes unsure in making the first step."
"Mostly when it comes to activities, sometimes distrust of us because sometimes it seems that we are depriving them of their members."
"There are pastors who admire what we do, and pray for us, but more often than not we are left alone."
"We have pastors that we depend on, obviously."
The Ministry is under the pastoral care of a church.
Q:
"In these 12 years, how many missionaries have maintained?"
"A: we have never supported anybody, only now we are sending the first missionary."
"But as far as preparation is concerned, we have prepared about 400 young people."
The fact is that our joy in Christ is giving the possibility to people to vote according to their vocation.
"This serves to keep people from what is ""Babel syndrome"", i.e. making a name and putting himself in competition with Christ."
"Then there are Christian missionaries movements at universities, ranging from Ministers that have been prepared by Gap."
This is something that makes us very thankful to God.
"Q: talking about you primarily, in these 12 years, you are devoted mainly to Gap?"
A:
"In these 12 years, many things are interlaced between my personal life and Gap."
"I have a doctorate in theology, and I am the Director of Gap, but"
I had to delay my studies due to commitments with Gap when we were at the beginning.
"And it's not like a rule book as much as guidelines so you can understand, this is why this will make your application better as you follow these various guidelines."
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
It's some kind of another instance of
line stuff up.
Don't reinvent a new way to do a list unless there's a really good reason to.
"Unless it really changes the character of your thing and there's a purpose, there's no reason to invent a new kind of scroll bar."
AUDlENCE:
"For the Android design style guideline, I was wondering what you guys foresee in terms of how its evolution is going to be over time, especially with phone devices, mobile devices."
"The screen size is getting larger, and a lot of times"
"I've heard that you want to keep things closer to your thumb, but with things like the Action Bar Menu and the"
"Overflow Menu, it's so far away on a large device that you no longer have the ability to easily do single hand actions."
ALEX FAABORG:
Yeah.
"Well, on large devices you have the radius of thumbs on the edges."
You want to definitely think about that.
"And the style guide, it's evolving as fast as the ecosystem and the devices are."
"We're constantly pushing out updates, considering new patterns, things like that."
So it's not like this sort of fixed thing that everyone has to adhere to as much as a kind of organic living document as we all collectively learn more.
AUDlENCE:
Thank you for the phone number slide.
I really like that.
It reminded me of one of the horrible failures of iTunes that I've just been annoyed by.
"If you have a date, and you format it with four numbers, a dash, two numbers, a dash, and two numbers more, that should be in ISO format for year, month, day, and no other order."
If you're having sort of the other random orders that some
"locales like, then use the slashes or whatever is sort of standardized for that."
And it helps users so much.
ALEX FAABORG:
"Yeah and especially thinking about your users, because you're going to have your own date format that you're familiar with, but knowing who you're designing for is really important."
AUDlENCE:
I do have a question this time.
Can you talk about tools a little bit?
"I mean, Photoshop is the obvious one, but what other tools can you talk about?"
"Những vụ trụ nảy lại sinh ra những vũ trụ khác nơi mà có thể có 1 bản copy chính xác của hệ mặt trời ,trái đất ,hay thậm chí của mỗi người trong chúng ta nơi mọi thứ cực kỳ giống nhau hoặc có 1 chút khác biệt nhưng những vũ trụ khác ở đâu vậy ? tại sao chúng ta không thể nhìn thấy chúng ?"
Bởi vì chúng ta ở 1 chiều không gian khác
Liệu đó có phải là sự thật ? nếu có các chiều không gian khác về hình dạng và kích thước cuộc thử nghiệm này sẽ tìm ra chúng câu hỏi không phải liệu chúng có tồn tại hay không mà là chúng có 1 2 3 hay 4 kiểu khác nhau
This sensationally means the universe sits in a sea of parallel universes.
"Imagine another world, a whole other universe... with a solar system and a planet exactly like ours."
"On this parallel Earth, there lives an exact copy of you."
You could be leading exactly the same life... but in another universe.
"Now, imagine an entirely separate universe... where you could be living a slightly different life... at the same time as you live this life."
"It may seem fantastic, incredible, and impossible... but there could be many other universes out there."
And now some of the world's leading physicists... believe that they have evidence to prove it.
We are experiencing an existential shock.
"Our worldview has been shattered... with the realization that, yes, there could be parallel universes."
"I mean, it's just a mind-boggling idea... that there may be, essentially... exact replicas of us out there in the vastness of space."
The idea of a parallel universe is part of our popular culture.
People all around us think of it every day... but usually in terms of fiction.
One of the real exciting things... is that scientists today are trying to see... whether parallel universes are a physical reality.
Amazing new discoveries about the true size of the universe... seem to indicate that all that we see... is not all that there is.
We humans have assumed...
"like ostriches with our heads in the sand... that just because we can't see something, it ain't there."
"When my grandma was a little girl, for instance... they still didn't know that there were other galaxies."
Now we know that there are... billions and billions of other galaxies out there.
"Remarkably, there may be four types of parallel universe out there."
"One kind could exist in the same exact space we're in... but it is so far away, we cannot see it or reach it."
"In another scenario, multiple other universes... could be in giant cosmic soap bubbles... adrift in a cosmic sea of giant bubbles."
Revolutionary developments have changed the entire landscape.
Data from outer space have given us a new look at cosmology... and satellite data indicates there could be parallel universes.
"In yet another scenario, many parallel universes... occupy the same space and time as our universe... but because they are in different dimensions... they are invisible."
"In yet another, all the laws of physics are different... so everything looks completely different."
New theories called string theories... are giving us worlds of higher dimensions.
Quantum physics at the microscopic scale... is also revealing to us the fact there could be parallel universes.
"To keep things simple, physicists have divided parallel universes... into different levels."
Meet the level-one parallel universe.
"How did not bother with their own fame, and what they left behind."
look at these men as a reference to people who have preached the Gospel of Jesus and how they gave their lives for King.
"Although few have known their names, Christ was known by them."
Then the Ministry wanted to be blessed in the sight of God.
"Not importatevi if you were to give the failed, but worry about heavenly things."
"All your suffering will be rewarded in heaven, along with the prize that Christ gives to those who serve with the heart."
"I would that all the brothers that I listen to, who are Ministers of the Gospel, are encouraged by the fact that the Lord God is immutable."
"Present in any church, whether large or small, and if God exists, is a glorious Ministry, because it is God who invites us to parectipazione."
"I think that in heaven there will be big surprises with those names that are great in the Earth, which could also be there ..."
"But those serfs who give themselves in Amazonia, they push in places undreamed of ..."
Well those are the men of real success!
"The Ministry is not determined by the amount of people that you're hearing, but for the quality of the action of the Holy Spirit in their hearts."
Don't get discouraged if you're not under the limelight ...
Be aware that the message we preach is powerful to save both Jews and Gentiles.
"Preaching boldly, and believe that God will do this."
"And if God exists, certainly the Ministry shall be blessed."
Escape from the limelight even as if they wanted to show that you can be more important than God.
"Whether you're famous, eloquent, whether you're known, none of this is important."
The only important thing is that you his faithful in delivering what the word
"God says, and not what we want the word of God says."
The human results are not important.
Sermon and sowing the word of God.
"One day the Lord will reward your efforts, your comfort heart, and we rejoice in him."
"Between listening to a great preacher, unfaithful to God, but with a good rhetoric and eloquence, and listen to a simple preacher who is not very eloquent, does not have the gift of speech, but is faithful to Scripture."
Well I always listen to preferirò the second to the first.
"Be faithful, preaches the word ama Scriptures, loves Christ."
And you'll have success.
In the eyes of God.
Some time ago I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Carson in the United States.
I was very touched.
"Told by his father, who had written a book: ""memoirs of an ordinary Pastor"" In that Conference, there were about 8000 persons there present."
"Carson with great frankness told him that many of the shepherds who were listening, are pastors of small churches and anonymous, with poor growth and does not have his own chance to speak to an audience so large."
We have to follow the European
laws in Europe.
We have to follow the Chinese laws.
"We decided in China we did not like the way in which their censorship was working, so we moved to the other China, which was"
Hong Kong.
So we'll see what happens.
So we make that decision on a per country basis.
My own view is that these changes are happening so quickly.
The societies are not really prepared for what's going to happen when everybody is online.
Everybody is posting information about what's going on around them.
"I also think that in general this is very good because it empowers citizens, and citizens are fundamentally good."
"Citizens fundamentally want to make their countries a better place, and so I would say that in a positive context."
But I think that countries are a classic example where the laws conflict.
There are obviously also corporations that have different models from us that we also compete with.
"I see there are some questions over there as well, don't forget them."
"Yes, sir? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; KAVlTSKl:"
Kavitski from Online Magazine in Germany.
I have two questions.
"One that is a specific one, Google translate, is that something you write, you also doing in a phone call over the air?"
"And the second, more general question about Chrome OS which, in my opinion, is almost like the big Android, for example, very suitable for tablets, is that coming soon or can you give us a short update there? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; SCHMlDT:"
"So, two separate questions that the live translate is the next logical succession to the demo that you saw and you could imagine eventually it might be possible."
"Right now, we can do it the way you saw it."
So we're pretty close.
And I think eventually it'll be possible to speak.
"Today, you can SMS somebody and without speaking the language and I think it's reasonable to expect that with some level of accuracy you'll be able to do it live over time."
"Again, as the technology gets better, and remember these algorithms are trained algorithms."
"As they get more data, they get better."
"So a classic example where the computer does something better because the humans help it and the humans do something better because the computer is there, they can actually communicate with each other."
"On the question about Chrome OS, Chrome OS has been announced."
Chrome OS is an operating system which is in early availability and it's targeted primarily at the Netbook space today.
"And of course, because it's free, it's open-source."
People will also use it for tablets.
"When contaminated food is ingested in the body, it weakens the immune system."
That's why the allergy aggravates and the diseases recur.
Some people claim their healed injury has started to ache again.
A weakened immune system also causes fatigue.
People with fatigue will probably become unable to extend themselves.
"About two weeks ago when we showed this data to you, you said you'd like to see a breakdown of the number of the reports according to prefectures."
So we created a map to show which prefecture those emails came from.
"And as you see here, most of them came from Tohoku and Kanto regions."
"In other words, from contaminated regions."
We are an webcast station that anyone anywhere in Japan can watch.
"Not a local TV station that can be viewed, for example, only in Kanto."
"Considering this fact, I was half-shocked and half-unsurprised to see most of the reports came from Kanto and Tohoku."
This seems to be an evidence that the connection with radiation cannot be ignored.
"Ideally, the government should be the first to conduct this kind of epidemiological research for the sake of the public health."
"The last time I went to Fukushima, I heard a story of some children in kindergartens and nursery schools in Date City in Fukusima Prefecture who aggravated a cold that lead to pneumonia and were constantly in and out of hospital, because of a weakened immune system."
This was exactly what happened in Chernobyl and I was shocked to hear that.
I really wished that such things would never ever happen in Japan.
I'm very worried by the fact that the people have been eating contaminated food and various symptoms have already emerged.
Something must be done.
"In Chernobyl, nothing was done with children for the first 3 years, which led to the high rate of cancer among them."
I'd really like the Japanese government to do something about it as soon as possible.
You went to Belarus 7 years after the Chernobyl accident and saw the situation there.
We're going to show some photos from the visit soon...
How was it?
In Belarus?
"Yes, when you visited Belarus...the photo is shown now."
"Well, they said there were no healthy children."
"If there were 100 children at school, 98 of them had some kind of health problems."
They said those children got ill when their immune systems weakened because of stress or shocking event.
"In other words, they were in the gray zone between ""healthy"" and ""ill."""
Most of the children were like ticking bombs that could explode at any minute.
"And the class length at school was shortened to something like 25 minutes, instead of 45 minutes."
Or even just walking and taking for granted the walking that we do.
"I feel like, maybe it is contradictory  but I feel like bringing my work into my mindfulness practice actually invites me to do a lot of unlearning."
A lot of moving against the habit energy of how school functions.
"So I don't know if that is helpful, but I that's one of the things that I am finding out."
"One of my main motivations  for doing this is,"
I guess I feel like there is a lot  of things that are difficult about being a teacher.
There is a lot of things that  are difficult about working with students in terms of where they are.
I think one of the things that Thay shared in the very beginning of the retreat was about the mindfulness of suffering.
"And I know we all know somethings are complicated but I feel that there is a way to look into the students and to ask ourselves or to ask myself, what has really happened?"
"So, in California, or maybe other parts where you teach, things have gone to the point  where we are doing a lot of teaching work, but I am not really quite sure what is actually being received by the students."
"I feel here is a lot of busyness that teaching and learning can look like we are very busy working, giving this, doing that,computers are out, but what are actually students getting?"
What are we actually cultivating  in young people?
"I feel that is a hard question, but I think in my mind, but I feel that is a thing  that I've been asked to look at."
"To look at that,  so young people are only test scores."
"But that's the things that  the conversations at my school are, that's the kind of conversation that we are welded to."
"I feel the mindfulness practice gives me opportunity not to feel overwhelmed by that,  but to look at it very clearly, so that I can understand  how to respond."
I can understand how to respond.
For instance - this might be  a small example- one of my students was sometimes  hanging out at lunch.
One time he said:
"""Why do you always say Good afternoon to your fifth period class?"""
"I guess I didn't really think much of it,  I guess I just want to say that."
"He was saying, ""I don't ever hear that in my classrooms."""
"I guess I just feel like - to me that's  a moment for me to listen, to listen to what are the experiences that young people are having in the classrooms."
"Sometimes - once again, hopefully your  work environments are much more healthy-"
I think sometimes schools are very  transactional for young people.
"You do your part,  I do my part."
"Don't get into my business, I won't get in your business,"
"Time passes, turn something in, then bye-bye, bell rang."
(Laughter)
"So we are in this thing,  more like tennis, it rolls that way,  'doing the schooling thing'."
But what is really going on?
"What kind of young people  are we really preparing for the planet that we live in,  for the communities that they live in?"
"Ethnic media outlets, like Iwi radio stations."
There's 22 of those.
There's two Pacific radio stations.
"There's Māori Television now, which is having a major impact."
"Pay television, online news websites, and of course social networks,"
"like Facebook and Bebo, and a strange thing called Twitter."
Anyone in the room Twitter?
"Yeah, Twitter is now the way that most news is broken worldwide."
"The Chinese earthquake was first heard of via someone under a desk somewhere, as the building was crashing around them,"
"Twittering to their network, sort of like text messages sent out to a network."
"And it strikes me that these are things that the young people are into, and the research needs to include that."
"Now what about my friends in the news media, how have they contributed to the debate?"
"Well, very defensively."
"No primary research on the effects in New Zealand has been commissioned by the Media Freedom Committee, so far as I can see."
"They had Jim Tully do a fairly limited review, no more than a literature review, from what I could see."
"The limited examinations I've seen have really concentrated on trying to discredit overseas research used by the Ministry's consultants and researchers, a pretty big task, after what we saw today."
And the result's pretty pallid.
"Someone picked up the fact that, in a paper, a researcher had misspelled ""causal"" as ""casual"" and was hugely excited about that."
But frankly I don't see that it was a fatal blow to the credibility of the paper.
"The news media industry as a whole in this country does little, if any, primary research on anything."
They do...
"Individual media companies do a lot of commercial research on readership and sales and stuff, but you never get to see that."
"So I'm not aware that they do any research on media effects, and they're not interested."
It's too expensive.
"So if they want to challenge the Ministry's position, frankly, they need to spend some money and do some research."
"I have a little bit of a problem with researching this topic, though, because we have such a restrictive regime."
"How can we really tell what the effects are if there is no, in effect, news reporting of suicide, other than name and the fact that it was self-inflicted?"
"So I'm not quite sure how you're going to gauge that, Brian."
"I'm sure you'll explain, but it strikes me as a kind of Catch-22."
"There have been some other problems with the press, the news media's response."
"The Press Council said that something had to be done about this because of the increasing problem, especially for young people."
It's a false premise.
So that's where his account ends.
Now we're going to pick it up with Daggett who offered his own account afterwards of what happened.
Okay.
"""On Monday morning, the 5^(th) instant the town of"
"New Haven was justly alarmed, with the threatening appearance of a speedy invasion from the Enemy."
Numbers went out armed to oppose them....
"Having gone as far as I supposed was sufficient,"
I turned down the hill to gain a little covert of bushes which
"I had in my eye; but to my great surprise I saw the Enemy much nearer than I expected, their advance guards being a little more than 20 rods distant, with plain open ground between us."
"They instantly fired upon me, which they continued till I had run a dozen rods, discharging not less than 15 or 20 balls at me alone; however thro' the preserving providence of God, I escaped from them all unhurt, and gained the little covert at which I aimed, which concealed me from their view, while I could plainly see them thro' the weeds and bushes, advancing towards me within 12 rods."
"I singled out one of them, took aim and fired upon him."""
Okay.
So he takes one shot.
"""I loaded my musket again, but determined not to discharge it any more, as I saw I could not escape from them [laughs] and I determined to surrender myself as a prisoner."""
"So he's charged out with his gun, he takes one shot, and he's like: 'what am I doing?"
[laughter]
I'm a guy with a gun and the
British Army.
What am I doing?'
"He's like: 'okay, I'll surrender myself as a prisoner.'"
"""I begged for Quarter and that they would spare my life."
"They drew near to me, I think two only in number, one on my right hand, the other on my left, the fury of infernals glowing in their faces, they called me a damned old Rebel and swore they would kill me instantly."
"They demanded, quote, 'What did you fire upon us for?'"" [laughter]"
Okay.
I love the question.
"'Why are you shooting at us, you old crazy man sitting in the bushes?'"
"""I replied, 'because it is the exercise of war.'"" [laughter]"
That did not impress the
"British, and apparently, they actually--they didn't treat him very well so they-- one of them pretended to stab at him with his bayonet and actually stabbed him a little bit, and some of them sort of [laughter] hit him on the head, and there's a long account here which I don't have time to read in which he talks about: 'this guy hit me in the head and that guy hit me on the shin and then some guy hit me with the barrel of his gun.'"
"And he actually--he ends up being forced to march at the head of the British troops back to New Haven, from wherever he is."
"And he says I think in his account, 'I finally--I saw the"
New Haven green and I was so happy I was back in New Haven.'
"But boss, where am I gonna put all this stuff?"
"I mean, a storage room is almost full, I can't even walk in there."
"The next topic I want to address is called ""Segmentation."""
"This is the problem of given a sequence of language, figure out how to break it up into words."
"Now, in Chinese we don't have spaces between the words, and so in order to understand if the first word of this message corresponds to a single character or two characters or what, we have to be able to do the process of segmentation and figure out where they are."
"In English, we don't have that."
Words have spaces between them.
"So we don't have the segmentation problem, but we certainly have it in speech recognition in languages like English, because this speech sounds are sometimes run together without pauses in between them, and there are places where we do have a language without segmentation."
"For example, in the language of URLs you could have a URL like ""choosespain.com"", which is the travel site that tries to encourage you to choose Spain as your travel destination, but if you segment it wrong, you'd come up with ""chooses pain,"" which would not be the intended expression for that particular URL."
So segmentation is an important problem.
Let's talk about how to do it.
So welcome.
"In this next module, I'm going to be talking with Dr. Gary Friedman."
I'm thrilled to have him here today.
I've mentioned his name a few times in this course.
"He provided a number of the, examples that"
I've shared with you.
And he's been a long-time champion of good writing in the medical literature.
"So, it's great to have him here today."
"He was, he has been an editor at the American Journal of Epidemiology for over two decades, and was the Director of the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California for almost a decade, and also is on the editorial board of a number of other journals and currently a consulting professor at"
Stanford.
"So I really appreciate you being here today, Gary."
"Oh, thank you."
It's a pleasure.
"So I'm just gonna start by asking obviously, we need to do good science."
"But besides good science, what are those, some of the key elements that journal editors are looking for when they get a paper."
"Well, one is novelty."
Mm-hm.
"That's we will often reject a paper without even sending it out for peer review, if it's just a repeat of findings that are already well know."
"I mean, if you're writing the thirtieth paper on alcohol and how alcohol is related."
"It to high blood pressure, or obesity is related to mortality."
"Don't expect people to be very enthusiastic [laugh], about it."
"And at the same time, in other parallel universes... the same cat can be alive and kicking."
But how?
How can you have a dead cat and a live cat simultaneously?
Because the universe splits in half.
"In one universe, we have a dead cat."
"In the other universe, we have a live cat."
Get used to it.
What is even more shocking... is that in some of these many worlds... a tiny quantum difference in thought can change the whole world.
It's like the butterfly that flaps its wing and makes the hurricane.
Tiny microscopic events would change the course of history.
"So every historical event actually happened... in every possible way in some branch... of this ever-splitting, many-worlds universe."
"In one, the Nazis won World War Il."
"In which case, I'm now speaking German... and there's a swastika behind me."
In another world... none of the horror ever happened.
"In one universe, there's no World War Il... and 50 or so million people didn't have to die."
"Like the endless rolls of the dice, all possible numbers... and all possible kinds of universes and outcomes... will eventually turn up and occur in one of these many worlds."
"In fact, all our wishes, too, can come true... in a parallel universe."
If the many worlds idea is right... then there's a branch of the universe... in which the Chicago Cubs won the World Series last year.
"You can imagine that the USA was still a colony... of the British, for example."
Even the impossible is probable in some parallel universe.
There could even be creatures coming into our world... from these mysterious extra dimensions.
"As mind-boggling as it sounds... when it comes to the amazing world of parallel universes... anything that can happen has happened or will happen... in some other universe... in some other dimension, space, and time."
Quantum differences can rewrite history... creating multiple universes... each with wildly different outcomes... where anything and everything is possible.
Some wars never happened.
Others we never imagined did.
A slight change means a comet missed... and even dinosaurs still roam some Earth somewhere.
"All and every one of these fantastic parallel universes... occupy the same space... but are in a different dimension, and so invisible to us."
Even as you peacefully watch TV... whole other invisible worlds could be raging all around you.
These parallel universes are in your living room.
"This means that in your living room, there are dinosaurs."
You can't hear them.
You can't see the dinosaurs... that are rampaging throughout your living room... but they're there.
Ole:
"That which we started about a decade ago, has begun at all business schools connecting art and economy and it is becoming more and more common, which is logical because where the hell would you draw the resources to be innovative from when you need to be innivativ all the time?"
"With violence and power there is almost only art left .. and as you begun with .. philosophy, right?"
Martin:
Both have done badly for some years
Ole:
They have but begins to turn back strongly
Martin:
"Well, you have some power now ... if I could pull some strings so you had A LOT of power in all parts of the world.. what would you do structurally, to face some of these crises?"
Ole:
I would make a society which is based on a lot smaller units
The Danish society I would base on a community with semi large municipalities
"That would run their own training concept, that would run their hospitals and would take responsibility for their young and old and completely developed their own alternative form of production"
Martin:
So the opposite of what we do today?
Ole:
Exactly the opposite of what we are doing today!
And then I would try in some way to stop tourism because it is the most CO2 consuming and time-wasting in the world but we can't do that because that would be totalitarianism and who should have the right to travel and what would a valid ticket be?
I myself am a delicate pensioner..
"No, I won't dwell on traveling"
But then I would...
"And I don't know how the hell I should solve it... but I would try to make the developing countries, such as Africa, proud of their culture so they with violence and force wouldn't try to take over our countries"
"like China and India are trying to... it creates an immense amount of problems on this globe in terms of resources and economic structuring and so on, right?"
Why the hell don't they hold on to their own way of life?
Ole:
"But if I had real power,,,,"
Martin:
"You will have, if you want..."
Ole:
Then would I influence them through their upbringing and their education to believe that what they stand for is really something that is worth a lot and that they should not take over our way of life
Martin:
But perhaps it has also something to do with food ...
"Because they're in the remote corners of those three countries, and the roads are awful, they're still very isolated."
They're still very self-sufficient.
They grow their own food.
They get water from springs.
They use local materials to make furniture and houses.
"They used to have kings and courts and armies and nobles, but colonialism put an end to all that."
"There are wondrous musicians, and they carry libraries of knowledge and stories in their heads."
The first person to write about the Zande was an anthropologist named Evans Pritchard.
"He lived among the Zande in southern Sudan for almost 2 years in the late 1920s, and he wrote this classic book, ""Witchcraft, Oracles, and Magic Among the Zande""."
"Over 50 years later, I found myself in Zande Land."
"As a Peace Corps volunteer, that was when I was young and glamorous-- is a Peace Corps volunteer in the Central African Republic, I taught high school for three years and most of my students were Zande."
I returned to Zande Land several times to do fieldwork for my graduate degrees at the University of Paris.
My own experience with witchcraft matched up pretty well with Evans Pritchard's account.
"In English, the word witch conjures up images of old ladies with warts on their noses wearing pointy hats and riding on broomsticks."
"Zande witch is, on the other hand look like regular people."
"There your family, friends, and neighbors."
"For the Zande, some people happen to be born with a special power inside of them that can cause harm when it heats up."
And it tends to heat up in a person gets angry or jealous or is offended or feels cheated.
"When someone's witchcraft heats up, bad things happen."
The best way to explain what witchcraft does is to use an example from Evans Pritchard.
It's common for the Zande to sit under granaries during the heat of the day.
"So one day there are two men sitting under the granary, and they're just talking; chatting as friends do, and suddenly it collapses on top of them and kills them."
"If you ask a Zande the question, why did the granary collapse, just like the bridge engineer, the Zande will be able to tell you structural deficiencies."
"The posts were rotten, the termites were eating away at the posts, and so it collapsed."
But that answer is not sufficient for the Zande.
"They will also ask, why did the granary collapse of the precise moment when those two men were sitting under it?"
Why didn't it collapsed an hour earlier or an hour later?
Why didn't those two men sit at another granary that day?
So the answer to that question is witchcraft.
"In other words, witchcraft does not explain why a granary or a bridge collapses, but it does explain why a particular person is under that granary or on that bridge when it does collapse."
Another example is a hunter killed by an elephant.
Several men go on a hunt.
"It was a disaster, and they were about to hit the wall."
Have a look at this bit of film footage.
"It makes me very sad because, while it's a fascinating animal, and it's amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction, we didn't, unfortunately, at this same time, have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species."
"These are photos of the last surviving thylacine, Benjamin, who was in the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart."
"To add insult to injury, having swept this species nearly off the table, this animal, when it died of neglect --"
The keepers didn't let it into the hutch on a cold night in Hobart.
"It died of exposure, and in the morning, when they found the body of Benjamin, they still cared so little for this animal that they threw the body in the dump."
Does it have to stay this way?
"In 1990, I was in the Australian Museum."
I was fascinated by thylacines.
I've always been obsessed with these animals.
"And I was studying skulls, trying to figure out their relationships to other sorts of animals, and I saw this jar, and here, in the jar, was a little girl thylacine pup, perhaps six months old."
"The guy who had found it and killed the mother had pickled the pup, and they pickled it in alcohol."
"I'm a paleontologist, but I still knew alcohol was a DNA preservative."
"But this was 1990, and I asked my geneticist friends, couldn't we think about going into this pup and extracting DNA, if it's there, and then somewhere down the line in the future, we'll use this DNA to bring the thylacine back?"
The geneticists laughed.
But this was six years before Dolly.
Cloning was science fiction.
It had not happened.
But then suddenly cloning did happen.
"And I thought, when I became director of the Australian Museum,"
I'm going to give this a go.
I put a team together.
"We went into that pup to see what was in it, and we did find thylacine DNA."
It was a eureka moment.
We were very excited.
"Unfortunately, we also found a lot of human DNA."
"Every old curator who'd been in that museum had seen this wonderful specimen, put their hand in the jar, pulled it out and thought,"
"""Wow, look at that,"" plop, dropped it back in the jar, contaminating this specimen."
And that was a worry.
"If the goal here was to get the DNA out and use the DNA down the track to try to bring a thylacine back, what we didn't want happening when the information was shoved into the machine and the wheel turned around and the lights flashed, was to have a wizened old horrible curator pop out the other end of the machine."
"It would've kept the curator very happy, but it wasn't going to keep us happy."
Workers can't just negotiate for their rights.
Striking is the best way to get their rights.
And I'll repeat again: negotiators must be elected so they don't betray the interests of the workers.
"We are 45,000 workers in the Public Transport Authority."
We have an independent union.
The independent union called us to join a strike
"The union said that workers had the right to social justice, to a minimum wage and to a decent pension."
The union said we must strike for the sake of our kids.
It's the same thing all over the world and not just in Egypt or in England.
"Ordinary people shouldn't be working to feed the rich, they should be working to feed their own families."
The rich just sit around at home getting richer.
They control the government.
"The capitalists"" control of the government is what loses workers their rights."
That is why workers all over the world must win their rights.
"I'd like to ask colleagues in London, how long before you rise up?"
You need to get the young people organised.
The time for waiting has passed.
The workers of London need to strike and fight back for their rights.
"They need to fight for the rights of pensioners, who can't win their rights themselves anymore."
"So I'm asking the workers of London, and the workers of the world to be like Che Guevara, and like Lech Walesa in Poland, to be like the workers of Egypt who changed the course of history with the revolution of 25 January and who overthrew the tyrant."
You should overthrow your tyrants in London.
"In a factory or in a public institution if there are only 5 independent worker activists but they have the confidence of their colleagues, then they can lead 5,000 others."
Each one can move a thousand.
"So I say, anywhere there are five activists like this, they can get people to move by telling them ""these are your rights and you must take them"", by showing how the rich are robbing the poor how globalisation is controlling people, and how wealth is going to a small handful, while people are dying of hunger in places like Somalia."
"I urge workers in Britain to make a revolution, because Britain is a great country."
"We love Britain because there is freedom there, and we had no freedom in Egypt."
Despite this we still had a revolution and overthrew a million policemen.
So can't you overthrow however many policemen you have?
You are the poor and yet you're working to make the rich richer.
You are the heroes of Britain.
You're the new generation of heroes
I call on the workers of London to lead the workers of the world in a revolution to overthrow tyranny in every country and get the poor their rights.
"But generally speaking it's the organisms in a particular place, plus the physical and chemical environment with which they're interacting."
And it's often a local example of some kind of biome.
Okay?
"So it could be a local chunk of tundra, a local chunk of rainforest, a pond."
It could be an upwelling area off Peru.
It could be an alpine forest.
It could be a lot of different things.
"And people study how energy flows, and so the paradigm basically, at least for things that are in the part of the planet that are driven by the primary productivity of plants, it starts with photosynthesis, and the annual production is usually determined by temperature and moisture; certainly for terrestrial ecosystems."
"Left out of this description is all of the chemosynthetic activity which occurs in deep, black, dark water at mid-ocean ridges, and which is occurring in the subterranean part of the biosphere that goes down- up to say five or ten kilometers, where there are bacteria that are living deep in the ground."
"And actually the pervasive influx of life, into the subterranean environment, is an important part in the biogeochemistry of the planet; that's not covered here."
"If we look around by, just by surface area, the planet's about 65% open ocean; it's about 5% continental shelf; desert's about 5%--that's extreme desert, okay, that's just about nothing on the surface; semidesert, so Sahel, that kind of area, about almost 3½, 4%; 3% tropical rainforest; and so forth."
"The idea here is you can take the planet and you can define different categories of the way things live on it, just by surface area, and break it down, and it looks like this."
"So here, if you were just to look at that, you would say, ""Well, open ocean, continental shelf, desert and rainforest are the main biomes on the planet."""
That's just by surface area.
"If you look at net primary production per square meter, you get a totally different view."
Okay?
"So this is just by surface area, and this is by primary production per square meter."
Look at how lousy the open oceans are.
Open oceans are deserts.
Why are open oceans deserts?
Student:
No fresh water.

"What I mean by that is that, a student can start here, do the first two years of university education, and then move on for the third and fourth year at the university, attain the bachelor's degree."
Most community colleges have articulation agreements with these institutions.
So it's a seamless process.
And it's the same degree in the end.
"The difference, however, is to the international students' advantage."
"Because you get the associate degree in the first two years, and you have a year of optional practical training available to you."
"You get the second degree, the bachelor's degree, and you have another year of optional practical training."
"So two work permits, you might say, for two whole years in the United States."
"That student, with that language ability and experience with the education, going back to their homeland for work has terrific opportunities that the student that stayed will never have."
So that's one of many.
"The other, of course, is the value proposition."
They are much less expensive.
"NOVA is 1/3 the price of the nearest university, which is a very good one."
And that's probably the least expensive of the universities around.
So already we're talking about one whole third of the tuition price.
"A community college has smaller classes, teachers that are not preoccupied with research."
"They are engaged with the student, one-on-one most of the time."
There are supportive student services that help the students adapt to the United States.
"And writing centers and tutors, all which are free here, are what the student can use to kind of help with their studies."
"So you've got student clubs, as well, associations, so forth, that the student can, here, become a better-prepared university student while they're at the community college, all for less expense."
So that's just part of the picture.
But I think it's an important part.
PATRlCIA GORDON:
We have international student counselors.
They're available for them throughout their two years or if they're here longer.
We have a career counselor.
And we have a transfer counselor.
"And all the faculty, really, are available."
That's the uniqueness of a community college.
The classrooms are small.
The faculty are available.
"Students writing essays to transfer to four-year schools, faculty, staff, counselors are all available to advise them, review their essays."
It's exciting because of scale.
"We can bring, and other companies can bring out products that can touch a billion people fairly quickly."
And these markets are
large.
"They're very, very large."
They touch a lot of people.
They touch humanity at it's--in the way it really is as opposed to the way we think--we think of it is.
"But it's terrifying because it's all about information, and ultimately, information is what people care a lot about."
"So we end up, we Google, end up in the middle of most of these debates, whether it's privacy or street view or numerous other issues which people here in the audience know about."
"And from my perspective, I think the debate is healthy."
These are new ideas.
These are new issues.
Society hasn't really decided what to do about some of these things.
"Having the sharing and the opinions of everybody really does help, at least, us inform how we make the decisions of how we go forward with these new products."
"And we encounter this--the scrutiny and we're prepared to participate, and of course, we accept it very much."
"This disruption, this benefit is going to continue."
"It's going to continue from companies like Google and others as well, and the future gets very interesting very quickly."
"This golden era--I talk about the golden era of--or the age of augmented humanity, you can imagine a golden era of breakthroughs."
"The computer science is now driving knowledge in human discipline in all sorts of new ways that can--that we can really solve the scientists' big problems; global warming, terrorism, financial transparency, because these are fundamentally information problems."
"So, imagine a future--this is a very near future that goes something like this: you don't forget anything."
Why?
Because the computer remembers.
You don't have to remember anymore.
The computer remembers.
It remembers the things that you should have remembered but you don't remember anymore because you have too much else going on in your life.
"Computers, in many ways, will become good at what we're not good at, making lists, remembering things, keeping memories and track of all the things going on in our lives."
Humans are just not very good at that.
Computers sort of excel with this sort of thing.
"You're never lost, right?"
"It's funny how, you know, you're always buying maps and worrying about things."
"Now you're never lost, right?"
Your smartphones certainly knows where you are.
"You can't really see, but these are Norwegian basking shark hunting vessels."
"The black line in the crow's nest signifies this is a shark vessel, rather than a whaling vessel."
The importance of basking sharks to the coast communities is recognized through the language.
"I don't pretend to [know many Irish words], but in Kerry they were often known as ""ainmhide Na seolta,"""
"""the monster with the sails."""
"Another title would be ""liop an dá lapa,"""
"""the unwieldy beast with two fins."""
"""Liabhán mór,"" suggesting a big animal."
"Or my favorite, ""liabhán chor gréine,"" ""the great fish of the sun."""
"That's a lovely, evocative name."
"On Tory Island -- a strange place anyway -- they were known as ""muldoons."""
(Laughter)
No one seems to know why.
Hope there's no one from Tory here.
Lovely place.
"But more commonly all around the island, they were known as the sunfish."
And this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out.
There's great concern that basking sharks are depleted all throughout the world.
"Some say it's not population decline, it might be a change in the distribution of plankton."
"It's been suggested that these sharks would make fantastic indicators of climate change, as they're basically continuous plankton recorders, swimming around with their mouth open."
They're now listed as vulnerable under the IUCN.
There's movements in Europe to try and stop catching them.
"There's now a ban on catching and even landing them, even landing ones caught accidentally."
"They're not protected in Ireland; in fact, they have no legislative status in Ireland whatsoever, despite our importance for the species and also the historical context within which basking sharks reside."
We know very little about them.
And most of what we do know is based on their habit of coming to the surface -- we try and guess what they're doing from their behavior on the surface.
"I only found out last year, at a conference on the Isle of Man, just how unusual it is to live somewhere where basking sharks regularly, frequently and predictably come to the surface to ""bask."""
It's a fantastic opportunity for a scientist to see and experience basking sharks.
They are awesome creatures.
"It gives us a fantastic opportunity to study them, to get access to them."
"What we've been doing for a couple years -- last year was a big year -- is we started tagging sharks, so we could try to get some idea of sight fidelity and movement and things like that."
So we concentrated mainly in North Donegal and West Kerry as the two areas where I was mainly active.
Afterwards you get to your computer at 4 or 5 in the morning and you try to be minimally creative and provide a bit of context and tell things that weren't being told in the rest of the media.
"Not regarding the focus, but rather looking for details which you think define what was happening."
"And try to write features that give people an idea of what's happening, way beyond whatever controversial incident may have happened that day."
"And then you sleep 3 hours, and then off you go again."
ST:
"Yesterday Virginia, from 20minutos, was here."
One thing that called my attention was they were always there.
It was the first media corporation that I began to recognise.
"I met Mirem, I met Marta, I saw them there..."
And it was a question of taking it easy.
Taking your time.
"It was hard to interpret, but you had to take your time."
Many media corporations didn't do that.
JL:
"It's a luxury, isn't it."
We allowed ourselves the luxury of spending hours in a square informing about that was happening.
It's hard for that to happen in a media corporation.
Very complicated.
We were born to do that.
We were born out of this journalistic crisis and we decided to slow down and inform with a bit of good sense.
"And we did that, and we created Periodismo Humano."
"But there's a lot of merit in other manstream media corporations which we are very critical of, but we have to acknowledge that there are some media corporations, especially some journalists who in their free time, went to the square because they decided they didn't need permission from their boss, their corporation or their structure, they went there because they wanted to be journalists for this kind of thing."
"The rest of the year they're bored, and when something interesting like this happens, and things are going on, they want to be there in the square."
If I hadn't been working in Periodismo Humano I would have spent my free time there.
And I'd have done the same job through my personal blog.
"I'm sure of that. fortunately there was a structure and co-workers who as a group made everything so much more valid, more visible, and richer."
But I'm sure that any of the journalists there would have done exactly the same thing.
"Because you become a journalist for things like this, and if they happen and you don't experience them, why bother?"
ST:
"To finish with the topic of journalism, I'd like you to tell me what the relationship with the people who gave you your information was like."
"Because the beginning was complicated, that first week."
But I get the impression that the management of that information was very efficient.

Gdp plus two.
"This cuts back rate in half, remember that yellow, I think it was the yellow line we had right at the start."

You basically have to get more efficient care to hit this target.
"And by the way, hospitals are excluded for the first period of time because they supposedly gave a lot of."
Of cross savings in that adjustment that we described earlier.
Just recently the [inaudible] committee approved [inaudible] that would eliminate the health force independent payment advisory board.
The bill could be considered by the full house as early as next week.
That's why it's in the news so Congress putting in the bill and actually the President insist that into bill because Peter convinced them it was as fail safe for cost control.
Congress hates the idea.
Why does Congress. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Take the idea about re-election.
"Yeah, why is Congress hate the idea of the iPad?"
"Of this independent [inaudible] and Advisory Board saying, here are changes and if you don't. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; [inaudible]. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Congress is giving up power, right?"
Some other boards doing it.
It's basically a vote of no confidence in Congress.
You guys can't do the right thing.
"So, we're going to have this independent board."
"For example, if I pick rock and you paper then you win."
I picked rock and you scissors then I win.
And so on.
"Again, the payoffs in both cases sum to zero."
"This parenthetically, this very simple children game actually has an annual competition that carries a nontrivial prize of $10,000 and it's actually a sobering thought that when we look at this trivial game then, perhaps, chuckle a little bit, if we actually participated in this competition we'd actually think hard about how to play it."
"Here's the other extreme, of games of pure coordination or pure cooperation."
"In this case, all agents have exactly the same interest."
"In other words, the payoffs for every action vector that they take is the same."
And so the utility for player 'i' is always the same as the utility for player 'j' for every action vector that they choose.
"And so again we here, too, will need to write each cell of matrix only one number because it's common to all the players."
"It's drives home that perhaps the unfortunate term ""noncooperate"" game theory that describes this dominant strand of game theory that we are discussing for now"
"It's, the name was suggested these are games for, that descibe situations that are inherently conflictual but as we see they apply also to games in which the interests of the players coincide."
So here's a game that describes the purely cooperative situation.
You and I walk towards each other on the sidewalk.
We can each decide whether to go to our respective left or respective right.
And if we pick the same side then all is good.
We avoid a collision.
"If we don't, then we do collide and that's equally bad for both of us."
"Of course in general, games will be neither purelly cooperative nor purely conflictual and here's a game that exemplifies that."
"This is a game that's called ""Battle of the Sexes."""
So imagine a husband and a wife who want to go out to a movie.
There are two movies that they can choose from.
"Let's say ""Battle of Armageddon"" and ""Flower Child."""
"The one, a violent war movie, and the other is a romantic comedy."
Above all they want to go together to the movie.
If they go to different movies then they are equally unhappy.
So they want to go to the same movie but they have conflicting preferences.
"The wife clearly would prefer to go to ""Battle of Armageddon"" and the husband, as romantic as he is, would like to go to ""Flower Child."""
"So, both cooperation and competition in this game."
"İyi ki doğdun, Fatmagül."
"[Glad that you were born, Fatmagül.]"
"Happy birthday, halacığım."
You do it with scientific measurements.
"So, today what people do is they use heuristics."
And the heuristics in that space are terrible.
The second issue in display has to do with standardization of ad formats.
"So, again, here you are--you have a property, you have a place for display."
And there's not agreement at the level that it needs to be on the standardization of the delivery of the display.
And especially around interactive and video ads.
"If you think about it, the future of display ads is not a static picture, but rather an ad that brings you in--that tells you a narrative."
The best ads add real value to the consumer's experience.
We take the view that ads are valuable if they're targeted and are information-rich.
"And the most information-rich, by obvious argument, is something which involves video and a story, and a narrative, and more references."
And the technology will enable the creation of those.
"And then the third, in our case, is the construction of the business relationship with the large advertisers we're still working on. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"

What do I really think will happen here?
I think that the problem has to do with Microsoft's ability to use its Windows monopoly to restrict consumer choice.

It's been discussed at great length.
"So anything that Microsoft would do that would eliminate consumer choice with respect to search engines, Internet browsers, distribution-- for which it was previously found guilty--are of concern."

And if you get it early enough.
"Why, that's a remarkable change in the time course of the disease, if you can stop it from progressing."
The way to stop it from.
Progressing early enough is either to have a very good neurological or psychiatric diagnosis.
Or to have a so called bio marker.
"That is an objective measurement either bio chemical or physiological that tells you, yes this person has very early stage Alzheimer's without a doubt."
Now we are not far along on either of those challenges.
Some of the new data suggest that.
"If you take measurements of the tau, remember the tau protein, and phosphorilated tau, and of a beta 42."
"And look at the individual, values, or the ratios among these."
"You can get a fairly early diagnosis, of Alzheimer disease."
"Another, fruitful approach, has just been approved by the FDA, the US Food and Drug Administration."
"It's a molecule, called Florbetapir."
It seems to bind to amaloid plaques that contain beta APP.

"Which emits beta particles, that's why it's called Florbetapir."
"So here is a typical positron emission tomography. a person who, does not have Alzheimer 's disease."
"Very few plaques, very few places, plaque places for Florbetabir to bind."
"Here's a person who, by other criteria, does have Alzheimer's disease."
"Clearly, there is a lot more binding, of Florbetapir."
"So, one needs to be extremely careful about these scans, as they're called."
And here are the words that the manufacturer uses.
A negative scan.
"Sparse to no neuritic plaques, inconsistent with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at the time the image is made."
So probably that patient does not have Alzheimer's disease.
"Since the patient goes to a neurologist in the first place for cognitive impairment among other complaints, then that cognitive impairment is not Alzheimer's."
"Now, of course, one needs to be very careful and say that a positive scan indicates moderate to frequent amyloid plaques."
And that some patients with these kinds of plaques also have Alzheimer's.
But.
"There are examples of people with other types of neurological conditions, as well as older people with normal cognition who show positive scans."
"So, the manufacturer says very carefully, Florbetapir is an adjunct to other diagnostic evaluations."
"More than this, we can't say at the moment."
Sal thank you very much from the Khan Academy.
Sal:
Thank you.
Tom:
And you and I will get together later and see if we can improve my math skills.
Thank you.
This is a Web Archiving Service tutorial video that will show you how to conduct an XML metadata export.
There are two different options for exporting as an XML file.
The first method can provide you with the document of all of your files.
"To complete an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Project Admin"" page, which is found under the ""Administration"" tab."
"Here you find a link to the XML metadata export page, in the list of reports."
"Once you are on the XML Metadata Export page, you may choose whether you would like to export all of your files, or just your publicly available files."
"Click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
The second option for exporting as an XML file allows you to create a limited list of files for export.
"To create an export of this type, you will first go to the ""Manage Sites"" page, which is found under the ""Sites"" tab."
"Once you are on the ""Manage Sites"" page, you can use the limits on the right side of the screen to narrow the results that are displayed."
"For example, you might choose to only display items that have been captured since a particular date."
"After creating a limited list, select the items that you are interested in exporting, and then scroll to the bottom of the page."
"Click on the link that says ""Get XML Metadata Export for selected."""
This link takes you to the same
"""XML Metadata Export"" page where you were able to choose whether you would like to include all of the items you selected, or just the publicly available ones."
"Again, click ""Create Report"" to export your data as an XML file."
"Choosing between these two XML Metadata options is dependent on whether you are interested in creating a brand-new list, or whether you are updating a previously created list."
The document created from the XML Metadata Export is a raw XML file.
You will need to convert the file to make it functional in your local system.
Feel free to use your local tools for this.
WAS provides a generic MarcEdit XSL stylesheet that can be installed to produce basic MARC records from the XML report.
You will still need to customize the XSL stylesheet to fit the needs of your institution.
"Further information can be found by clicking on the ""Help"" link and choosing ""XML Site Report."""
"This document provides a description of all of the fields in the XML report, as well as a link to the previously mentioned"
XSL crosswalk for MarcEdit.
This has been a Web Archiving Service video tutorial on how to conduct an XML metadata export.
"The solution for me, is back again to the government, because the people, most of the people here, already agree about the garbage separation or the recycle, all the slogans, like ""Reduce, reuse, recycle"" or ""Bali go clean and green""."
Everyone already agrees on those slogans.
"But what we're talking about now is after the slogan, or after the the idea, something that you wrote, the words you have to do the action right now, right?"
"So what we're waiting for now, we as the grassroots movement, or the people still doing what we believe it, what we're waiting for is the government law to support this action."
"To institute that change on such a massive scale, wow, I mean, the government needs to intervene, and it needs to intervene from the top all the way down to the village."
"Every level, you know, and the way, with regional autonomy in Indonesia, ya, the Governor can say it should be like this, but then the Bupatis need to follow suit."
They need to care; they need to really care.
"I think now the government still doesn't have any serious concern about the garbage but I do believe, especially the Balinese"
"local government, because government in Bali is quite unique, we have a formal government and an informal government, and they are both equally strong, 50-50."
"So if both these governments had a really serious concern about the garbage or waste issue, it would be socialized effectively in the public."
"We, people here, would support 100%."
So make it real.
"""Refuse plastic bags, refuse plastic bags, plastic, plastic, plastic, refuse plastic bags."
"Bali is a beautiful island, plastic bags are giving it a scaly skin,"
"Let's play music, and support a beautiful Bali without plastic."""
(Off camera) What is a social worker?A social worker is really what I call an Agent of Change
A change agent.
And that is so important to understand the distinction.
When you look at a patient.
The doctor sees the patient.
The doctor doesn't see anything else but the patient and inside the patient.
The social worker does not just see the patient.
The social worker sees family.
The community at large.
The resources within the community.
And deals with all of them.
That is your change agent.
Because we do not focus on one thing.
We focus on the entirety.
And you really can't cure anything without looking at at the entirety.
If you only work on the one individual someone with mental illness or the senior... what about what comes with the senior?
"Well there's finances, there's there's housing, there's family issues, there's all these other issues."
"You could have this circle right over here, so you see clearly that two points are not enough"
You need three points.
"Three points lead to a triangle, which leads to a unique circle"
So that by itself is kind of cool
Now another question is if I have a circle
And if it circumscribed about an arbitrary triangle is the center of that circle necessarily the circumcenter?
So let's think about that a little bit because there are some non-intuitive cases here.
"So if I draw a circle right over here, its center is right over there, and if I draw an arbitrary triangle where all of the vertices of that triangle are on this circle, is this center necessarily the circumcenter of that triangle?"
So let me draw a crazy situation
Let me draw one where this thing is clearly outside of the triangle.
So we could have one that looks like this and clearly all three vertices sit on the circle.
"So you might first say, wait, there's no way this could be the circumcenter, it's not even inside the triangle."
"But remember, this point right here is equidistant to every point on the circle."
"I should say, every point on the circle is equidistant from this point."
They're all a radius away.
And all three points of this triangle are on the circle
So they are all exactly a radius away from this point right over here.
"So this distance is going to be a radius, this distance right over here is going to be a radius, and this distance right over here is going to be a radius"
"Now, this point is clearly equidistant from that point and that point."
We know that.
It's exactly R away from both of those vertices of the triangle
"So if it's equidistant, and we proved this in a previous video, if it's equidistant from both of those points, it must be on the perpendicular bisector of the segment that joins those two points"
So this must be on the perpendicular bisector.
"So that's perpendicular, and it bisects that segment right over there."
But we can make the same argument for this segment right over here. because this point is R from the center
"We're going to call it point 0, I'm tired of just calling it ""this point"" point O is equidistant from"
"Let me label these, so let's call this A, B, C."
So we already said point O is equidistant from
"C and B, so it must be on the perpendicular bisector of BC, and it's also equidistant from A and B"
It's R away from both because
A and B both sit on the circle they are both a radius away from the center
So it also must sit on the perpendicular bisector of A and B.
"But raising them, of course we should raise them."
The problem is that the current system of education was designed and conceived and structured for a different age.
It was conceived in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment.
And in the economic circumstances of the Industrial Revolution.
"Before the middle  of the 19th century, there were no systems of public education."
Not really.
"I mean, you could get educated by Jesuits, you know, if you had the money, but public education,  paid for from taxation, compulsory to everybody and free at the point of delivery, that was a revolutionary idea."
And many people objected to it.
"They said it's not possible for many street kids, working class children, to benefit from public education."
"They're incapable of learning to read and write, and why are we spending time on this?"
"So, there's also built into it a whole series of assumptions about social structure and capacity."
"It was driven by an economic imperative of the time, but running right through it was an intellectual model of the mind."
Which was essentially the Enlightenment view of intelligence.
"That real intelligence consists in this capacity for a certain type of deductive reasoning, and the knowledge of the classics, originally."
What we've come to think of as academic ability.
"And this is deep in the gene pool of public education, that there are really two types of people: academic and non-academic; smart people and non-smart people."
"And the consequence of that is that many brilliant people think they're not, because they've been judged against this particular view of the mind."
"So, we have twin pillars, economic and intellectual."
And my view is that this model has caused chaos in many people's lives.
It's been great for some.
There have been people that have benefited wonderfully from it.
But most people have not.
Instead they suffer this.
"This is the modern epidemic, and it's as misplaced, and it's as fictitious."
This is the plague of ADHD.
"Now, this is a map of the instance of ADHD in America, or prescriptions for ADHD."
"Don't mistake me,"
I don't mean to say there is no such thing as Attention Deficit Disorder.
I'm not qualified to say if there is such a thing.
"I know that a great majority of psychologists, and pediatricians think there is such a thing."
But it's still a matter of debate.
"What I do know, for a fact, is it's not an epidemic."
That's gonna be hot.
It's nice!
Very savoury but soft!
A little bit different from your normal grain.
"So, I hope you enjoyed your savoury oatmeal dinner, we're gonna have ours put in a plate and topped it off with the avocado and enjoy it here on the roof top in Kas."

In 2007 the crisis in the real-state market spread fast around the world
Millions of people lost their houses and their jobs ?
We are deep in shit and we all know it but we still trust that all is not going to fall apart
Is capitalism destroying itself and
I think that is all splosh
Capitalism
Karl Marx and the critique of Capitalism is undergoing a revival today
To bring Marx's Kapital to the stage is a crazy edeavour
The success of this play is very astonishing for me fully unexpected
The achivement of Capitalism is the limitless capacity or commodities
But how can Marx's criticism of capitalism can help us to gain a better understandig of this crisis?
The question from Marx is not aimed at more critique
From where does all the enthusiasm with everything that has to do with Karl Marx comes?
"In a lot of countries in the West, dealing with your waste, you're kind of separated from it, you put it in the bin and it magically disappears."
"Someone comes, it's all arranged for you."
You don't have to think about it.
"And here, you have to make an extra effort, because there really isn't a system, so you have to think about it."
You're confronted with it.
"So even though there's a really bad problem, there's a positive side, because you're forced to recognize the problem."
You're forced to have to deal with it.
"So looking at that side of it, it's really an opportunity for people to kind of confront their their consumption, their pollution."
"Bali has a problem about every year our coastal, when it's the season once a year, a lot of plastic garbage landed in Kuta coastal."
The government said this is because of the sea tides.
"It's not about the sea tides, from my opinion, it's about people still throw plastic garbage in the river or in the canals and they flow to the ocean, and the ocean will bring it back to the land."
"Waste management is a little bit the land of no one, no?"
"I mean it's a little bit, you can almost do whatever you want without really being caught. / But the garbage problem affects everybody, rich and poor, and if you can't deal with that basic problem- pollution from your waste- then how are you going to deal with these large, more complex problems, like deforestation, destruction of the coral reef, and climate change."
let's see how that evolves.
"If they can keep an inclusive tone, or if the impulse they've achieved can't be contained and it all splits up."
But it's clear that the motor has been cranked into action.
That's very important.
ST:
And to finish.
What's the future of the 15M?
JL:
"I think the 15M is a state of mind, it's a diagnosis, and it's an inspiration."
"I think nostalgia is a bad travelling companion for the people who have participated in the 15M, because the Puerta del Sol, the Sol camp, is not going to come back."
"The commission of infrastructures is not coming back... at least not in the same terms,"
I don't know if I'm wrong.
But I think it's very hard for all the perfect conditions to come together again for it to happen like before.
"Sometimes you talk to someone who participated very intensely in it and they say that a better world is possible because when they were there, they were hungry and a lady gave them a dish of maccarroni, and then they helped a commission to put up a stand, then they went to see other people camping on the other side of the city to convince them of whatever..."
"And they tell you all these brutal experiences to justify, or as if it could be reproduced permanently all over the world."
"Some people agree with that and have an ideological justification for it, but I'm not going to go into that kind of thing."
But there are people who are attached to that nostalgia.
And we'll have to wait and see how they manage that nostalgia.
And there I see a danger for the 15M.
Or for what the 15M stands for.
"But I insist, it's a diagnosis."
The 15M is a diagnosis.
It's a state of mind and an inspiration and we're still not conscious of the number of projects that it kick-started in May 2011.
"Neurons have been activated amongst groups of friends, amongst of strangers who suddenly met, things like this documentary have been created."
"There are many projects, audiovisual and not, many projects of many different kinds which were created thanks to the inspiration or the motor of the 15M."
And I think those projects are going to lead the way towards the future of the 15M.
"More than just assemblies, more than demonstrations in the street."
It doesn't matter how many are called.
"But I think the projects that arose, inspired by the 15M will be the 15M of the future."
Even if they're not the 15M.
But the spirit will be there in a mystic kind of way. the 15M will experience those projects because they were born there.
"Contact with international media corporations, international perception of the 15M."
"When we see the beautiful in our Buddhist Society, you see the beauty in your partner, you see the beauty in yourself, you see the beauty in our wonderful Prime Minister Mr Howard [laughter]."
What are you
"laughing for, you cynical group?"
[laughter].
You can see the beauty in these things!
"And jee, I mean I wouldn't like to be a Prime Minister."
Would you?
It's a very difficult job.
"So when you start to see the positive parts in these people, you're actually generating the positive emotions such as respect."
"How many people actually have respect for their parents, for their partners, for the people in authority?"
Why do we disrespect our systems?
"Because we've been cultivating those fault-finding negative thoughts in our media, in our newspapers, in our conversations."
No wonder we have a lack of disrespect.
"You know if you ask people in other countries they look at Australia - ""This is a beautiful land."
It's pretty well governed.
"It could be better but could certainly be a lot worse!"" So why don't we have respect for our institutions, why are we so negative?"
"You know if we're so negative with our institutions, we get very negative towards our partners."
"Why is it that in our modern life people have such a hard time finding a life partner, keeping them, sticking with them?"
Because they always find fault with each other.
"And why do people always have lack of self-esteem, getting depression, because they start finding fault with themselves as well."
I'm not good enough.
They're not good enough.
Life's not good enough.
Be careful because that path leads to big depression.
We're actually building up those negative emotions and instead we can build up the positive emotions.
We deliberately look for something in our partner we can respect and love and care for.
"We deliberately look in something in ourselves which we can love and care, respect."
"We deliberately look for something in life which we care about, we love and got passion for."
"And that way, by focusing on that, we're building up, generating, the positive emotions of life."
"And when you start to learn how you can generate those positive emotions, the path becomes clear just how you can have a sort of control of this emotional world of yours."
"You're not just like a rudderless ship, always going through these storms and these calms of the ocean of your emotions, but you can actually have some guidance there, you can generate beautiful emotions."
That's basically just what our whole path of Buddhism is.
Is less.
"The time, the, the twin number, The twin on Earth aged during this segment is, indeed, less than the time that, the moving twin aged here."
And the same bi-symmetry is true up there.
"But when you add this extra segment from jumping ships, it's unambiguous the twin on Earth is older."
This is not a contradiction to relativity.
There is a difference between them.
You could measure the difference.
One of them accelerated.
Okay.
So we've cleared up the paradox We understand that the twin that accelerated remained younger and there is not a violation of relativity because you could measure the difference between the two.
"One was inertial, one accelerating."
"Okay, but there is an unsatisfactory feeling to this resolution because what I've essentially done is hidden all my ignorance in this instant of infinite acceleration where instantaneously as seen by the moving twin is."
"Suddenly aged all the difference that makes up the, the, the, for the, for the,"
"Lorentz, the time dilation that he otherwise would have seen."
This infinity doesn't make sense.
Can I do better?
Well of course I can do better.
"What I really wanna do, and in fact, the only physical thing to do, is you can't have infinite acceleration."
You could apply a finite acceleration and you could round off this corner a little bit.
And now I have a story without infinite acceleration.
"You can ask well what happens here? computing here is a little bit more difficult, because now the moving twin is not in an inertial frame."
"The way I cheated before was, that I, he jumped from one inertial frame to another inertial frame."
"And I ignored the acceleration that this implies, now I have to deal with this acceleration."
And that requires a little more calculation then we have.
"But we can get a sense for what this implies, by imagining here's a trick that will cause him to accelerate."
Remember I want him to be moving to the right and then accelerated to the left.
And the way I'm gonna do this is I'm gonna imagine that
"Somewhere out here, I don't know."
Little distance not exactly in the direction it is moving so it isn't crashing there.
But not far from there lies a star a heavy massive object.
"And what I am going to imagine is that as this twin approaches, the star is accelerated and then goes into hyperbolic orbit and is deflected by the star so that he comes back to the earth."
So basically I arrange the angles so that he overshoots the star.
"I know the artistic directions we could take; I ensure media quality, and I have some control of the production process."
"But it's important to involve one more person in this process, and that person is the"
Instructional Design Consultant.
"You should have one assigned to you when you begin teaching, if you haven't been teaching already, and they are aware of course objectives, I don't really know course objectives when you come in, I only know that you need a video done."
"So, it's important to involve the Instructional Designer in that aspect."
They also know the best teaching methods that can be used.
It's important to have this three-way meeting between these people before we move on and actually start creating the video.
"Next, you need to know your format."
There are a few formats that we can use.
"There is: interview, teleprompt, teleprompted PowerPoint, and extemporaneous."
"The interview format is the most natural because it's conversational, it doesn't really require that much preparation because it's whatever happens, you need to have the person next to you to prepare."
"You should be familiar with questions and follow up questions, which means you need to pay close attention to what your guest is speaking about in order to follow up correctly."
Next is the teleprompter.
A teleprompter is...
I'm actually using one right now...
It is a script from a word processing document.
"It's very rigid due to it's word for word nature, and I would suggest not using it."
"Now, I'm not actually using a scripted teleprompter,"
I'm using a PowerPoint teleprompter controlled by an iTouch device.
"I call this teleprompted PowerPoint, or just PowerPoint."
"It's a good alternative to teleprompting because it is not word for word, you don't lose your spot, and it's like using note-cards, but you're not looking down."
"When you look down, away from the screen, it looks awkward and people can tell."
"You can control, again, with an iTouch, and it can't be seen by the camera."
"So, what would you do if you're going to use this format?"
You would e-mail me the PowerPoint.
I'll provide my e-mail at the end of this presentation.
"Do watch out for small text, no less than 24 pt."
"The best way, finally, to approach a format, is to use extemporaneous style."
"That is, without (maybe without) notes, but don't read word for word... it feels very rigid."
"That leads me to my last point, know your presentation."
"All of these techniques, excluding maybe the interview, require a good amount of practice before coming in to film."
"Mistakes can be edited out, but it looks more professional with the less cuts I have to make."
I'm not able to trace that reference.
Alright.
"So I said, well, well good."
"They gave two references, so I have hope here."
So I went to reference fourteen.
"Pulled up, the paper."
It was a paper.
"Scanned through the paper, did a search on the paper."
"It did not contain the words the ambient sunlight, the word mountain, or the word"
"UVC and I didn't do UVC lighting, I just did UVC."
So there was no mention of any of those things in that paper.
"So, it was a reference to nowhere, because what the authors were giving me as their backup for that statement, it just didn't exist at least not in those references."
"So I wasn't able to ever get that information, cuz it wasn't at least where the authors told me it was."
"So that's an example of references nowhere and again, I think this happens a lot."
"So, you know, if you can avoid it in your own writing, hopefully, by doing a good prewriting step, by carefully organizing your information before you start, and keeping your, you know, that information with the references early on you won't make these kinds of mistakes where you just have references that don't actually back up what you're saying."
"And then finally, the citation propagation concept like telephone I was, I was saying before."
This was one of my pet peeves and so I just want to point out an example of this and caution you to avoid citing secondary sources.
"So, when I was a graduate student, I worked on, something called female athlete triad."
"And one of the components of that triad was something we called disordered eating, which itself is kind of poorly defined, but in any case, a part of the triad is disordered eating."
"So people would always want to say, well, how common is disordered eating in female athletes?"
"And at the time that I was a graduate student and writing out papers on this,"
"In the late 90's or early 2000's, there was Hallmark statistic that everybody cited."
"It's, the statistic was that fifteen to 62% have disordered eating."
And that was just in every paper on female athletes triad eating disorders in athletes.
That's just the one that everybody gave.
"However, it wasn't like they all cited the same source."
"If you, I was trying to trace back at one point where that statistic came from and I found about 50 different attributions for where that statistic came from."
"So one paper would cite Smith et al., another paper would cite Jones et al and they all cited different things."
Well obviously that statistic came from somewhere.
"So, everybody's citing secondary sources."
"So, I want to give you some examples."
"So, this was from a paper in the Journal of General Internal Medicine."
"So somebody, you know, Jones et al, Smith et al does the original study, They come up with a number of figure or statistic."
Jones et al cites Smith et al.
"Okay, now Beery et al goes to give the statistic in their paper."
"Well, they found that statistic in Jones et al,"
"They read it there, so they don't bother to go back to Smith et al and get the original reference, they just reference Jones et al."
"Okay, well then what happens, well."
"James et al now wants to say Beery et, you know, it reads the statistic and Beery et al, Now, they say Beery et al."
"So, now this citation, this statistic has gone through multiple, it's been propagated across the literature."
"And it reminds me of the game telephone, that children play."
"So, if you're not familiar with that game, that's the game where the children sit in a circle."
And the first person who comes up with a sentence.
And they whisper that sentence in the ear of the next child.
"And then, that child whispers into the ear of the next child, and so on and so forth until you go around the circle."
You get to the last child.
"And that child said, says out loud what they heard."
And it's always something that's very garbled and funny that has little resemblance to what started the statement that started the whole game.
And this is just what happens in the scientific literature when you propagate citations.
"You get, you lose important pieces of information from the original source down, down the chain."
"And so be, pay attention to that."
I'm going to talk a little bit more about that give you an example in a minute.
"And then, sometimes others just miss number references."
A way to avoid this is if you have available to you a reference management program like EndNote.
It's highly recommended that you use that cuz that can avoid these kind of mistakes.
But I'll give you an example of a paper I was working on a few years ago.
There were multiple authors in the paper.
We were not using a reference manager since there were multiple authors across different institutions looking at the paper.
"There was, and the writing had some problems in it, so a number of authors rewrote the paper, did some heavy editing on the paper."
"And in that process, a few of the references, the reference numbers got garbled."
"So, reference what we were calling reference three on draft one, you know, became reference five on draft two and nobody made the correct change."
"So, when that paper went out for a review with misnumbered references, because all sorts of confusion among the, one of, in particular, one of the reviewers, in terms of they were confused."
"And I initially thought that the reviewer just didn't know the literature, but actually when I looked carefully, I finally realized that the reason that the reviewer's confused because our number references are misnumbered."
"And so luckily we've caught it but it can happen pretty easily, especially if you're not using an automatic reference management program."
"Literally within the browser, we can have more things going on to benefit you because it's a more powerful platform than any other browser; and I could assess that technically, but the important thing is it really is a much more powerful platform for this new augmented humanity model."
"At the same time, I've not talked about monetization and ads and so forth because I wanted to talk about end-users first."
It's also important that the people in these ecosystems make money.
So an example would be that people have thing--information that they want to sell.
They have advertising they want to show.
"There are many, many examples of this, and we take this very seriously, so obviously our revenue is among other things."
YouTube is a very interesting example of this.
YouTube--and everybody here is using YouTube--YouTube is this amazing global phenomenon now.
It has more than two billion of views per day.
Think about that.
Two billion views of YouTube everyday.
"I mean, think about the amount of time being spent doing this."
"A hundred and sixty million mobile views per day, 24 hours of video uploaded every minute, right?"
You can imagine the quality.
I'll leave that up to you.
"The business is doing very, very well with more than two billion monetized views per week and the number of advertisers, the number of monetized views is up 50% in the"
last year.
"Partners are doing well, our display business, another component of this."
We have more than 300 million visitors per day.
"We have more than--we--the DoubleClick platform, which we acquired awhile ago, serves over 45 billion ads per day, and 94 of the top 100 Ad Age advertisers advertise on the Google display network."
"So, what I wanted to do in a, in a sort of to start was to lay a framework, a model for you of what things are like now."
And what I felt would be fun would be to have some demos of products that are just about to get released and I hope will work in our demo.
The person in-charge of our mobile effort is Hugo Barra.
You want to come on up?
Why don't you get started?
And let's see--let's see what Hugo has for us. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; BARRA:
"Thanks very much, Eric."
Hello everyone.
My name is Hugo Barra and I'm part of the mobile product team at Google.
"Well, Eric was talking to you about the super computer in your pocket which, of course, is your mobile phone and what I wanted to do is actually show you a few specific examples of what exactly we mean by mobile super computing."
One of the most exciting and challenging technologies that we've been working at Google for many years is speech recognition.
"Two years ago, we launched the first version of our voice search application which I bet many of you here in the room use everyday to search the web."
"Arley, maybe set the stage with your own take on the budget."
The big picture.
"Where do you see this going in terms of a negotiation for Grand Bargain, the likelihood of that happening, the politics in the"
House especially?
"And then set the stage, if you will, for the challenges that CSBG is going to face which are going to be very, very big for FY ""14."
Arley:
I'll probably speak briefly about CSBG and then have the CSBG presentation and then speak a little bit more to that.
"In terms of the budget, and the key word is politics, the President is doing his best at this present time to try and get a Grand Bargain."
And the Grand Bargain was that he was trying to negotiate with the help of John Boehner last year prior to everything concerning sequestration.
There appear to be enough votes and some republican and democrat support in the House on what we would call a grand Bargain.
"And, of course, the issue there is whether you raise taxes a little bit more or whether you cut spending."
And what's been proven by the sequester is you cannot tax your way to prosperity and you cannot spend your way to prosperity either.
It's obvious the draconian cuts hinder and stifle the economy.
"And to cause money to grow in the economy, you've got to spend money."
After
"WWII and with the depression, FDR did it during the depression by spending money."
"When no one has money, when there's a low ebb and flow of money in the country, the government prints more money."
The government makes more money and the government puts people to work.
That's the reason why the President is concentrated on the stimulus programs.
"You hear him talking about the infrastructure, talking about roads and bridges, also talking about high speed rail and those types of things."
That's what the administration wants to do.
You have to juxtapose that against what some of the right wing of the
Republican Party want to do.
They want to cut everything.
You can't cut everything.
You've got to spend money in order to generate jobs.
In order to have jobs you've got to put some money into the industry and into different areas of the economy.
One good sign that's going on is it appears that the housing market is rebounding.
"As the housing market goes so goes construction, so goes long-term jobs."
The housing market is a good indicator that the economy is turning around.
"In terms of the unemployment rate, it is steadily coming down."
Even though there weren't that many jobs created in the last month overall the trend is still good.
And those are the pieces of wood.
Those are the instructions.
"These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up."
"What you can see is there's about six different colors, and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut."
"All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck, and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people, only one of whom had ever seen the plans before."
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
"And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard, and there it is fully built."
"There are only 16 different pieces of wood, only 16 different assembly parts here."
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
"It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool."
"It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks."
"It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas, where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long."
"Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations, this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center, replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street, that very important pedestrian connection between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side."
"They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks, building it, including all of the parts, manufactured."
And they were able to do it.
"That was their design, using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts, a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck."
They were able to create that.
They were able to create something wonderful.
"They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York, using the same technology."
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
"It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting, so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face."
Here it is going across.
"And there, down the other side, and you get the same kind of grandeur."
"Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may."
"Woo, pretty, huh."
This is the other side of the coin.
"This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City, whose work you can see out here today."
"The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work in a very different fashion."
"It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you into something that you can do, into something that will please you, something that will lift your spirits, something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his Nobu restaurant in New York, which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition."
"""When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed,"" said the owner."
"Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.
"A mysterious, massive cluster of stars, that we'd now call a galaxy."
"And back then, what we could know about the universe was limited by the amount of data that we could collect, and things just aren't the same anymore."
"Modern astrophysics looks not like this, but like this."
A picture of a million galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.
"Each dot, an individual system of  hundreds of billions of suns."
"And if we want to understand the evolution of the universe, if we want to understand how we got this wonderful universe that we see around us, we need to study these galaxies."
But there's a problem.
The problem is that we don't really like the universe that we've ended up with.
We've got this 96% of the universe in a form that we don't understand.
In dark matter and dark energy.
And so we need to pay closer attention to each one of these millions and billions of galaxies.
"We need to treat them not as points of light, but as individual spirals or galaxies, because the shapes of the galaxies tell us about their history."
So you can tell that this spiral galaxy  has had a very different past from a big ball of stars that we call the elliptical.
That's what we set out to do.
We set out to try and identify the shapes of the galaxies.
And that's a task that humans are much better at than computers.
"We're very good at this sort of pattern recognition task, and computers are really rather poor."
"We tried getting a student to look at a million galaxies, and I can tell you that, after about  the first 50,000, they give up."
And so we needed a new solution.
We decided to call for help.
"We set up a web site called ""Galaxy Zoo""."
This is what it looks like today.
"And Galaxy Zoo asked everyone in the world to help us classify these galaxies, to say what shape they are."
"And on the first couple of days at Galaxy Zoo, we got this amazing response."
"We were doing 70,000 galaxy classifications every hour."
"And while we haven't continued at that speed, over time, we've done hundreds of millions of classifications from hundreds of thousands of people."
"And the even better news is that, taken together, those classifications are more accurate than those supplied by professional astronomers."
"The crowd does not make mistakes, and it has endless enthusiasm for this task of sorting through pictures of the universe."
But actually that's not the interesting part.
Something else very interesting happens when you invite hundreds of thousands of people  to take part in your research.
"What happens is that you have to remember that yes, there's a crowd, but the crowd is made up of individuals."
So here's one of our classifiers.
It's to be distracted and allow the environment and stimuli in the environment to control our attention.
"So yeah I think it was the book and other developments that trained us to pay attention, but the fact that that was has been a fairly short part of our history doesn't mean we should give it up easily, but cherish it all the more and protect it all the more."
PETER NORVlG:
I'm all for protecting it.
And we are going to go to questions in a few minutes.
There's the mic so if people want to ask questions please line up there.
And while we're doing that I just want to mention one more thing which is maybe the book that is closest to yours that's popular now is Clay Shorkey's Cognitive Surpluses and he talks about what he calls cognitive surpluses is this idea that its the thing television stole form us
"That in history from most of history, we had to spend all of our time just sort of surviving."
"And then in modern society, we got this new notion of leisure time and that was something that never existed before, and then television took it away to the tune 200 Billion hours a year in the U.S. alone."
"And clay points out, if one percent of the TV watchers throughout the world stop watching TV, and did something useful, they could produce two Wikipedias a week."
(Laughter)
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Just what we need (more laughter)
PETER NORVlG:
What's your comment on Clay's take?
NlCHOLAS CARR:
"I think Clay's a very smart guy and think he's a very hopeful guy and if in fact we see that change in behavior that would be a good thing, but what we know from the statistics is that TV viewing hours have gone up throughout the entire era of the web and in fact they hit their highest era since the Neilson Company began monitoring TV last year."
"And if you had to those TV hours which are now at the highest point ever, all the time we waste online as opposed to creating Wikipedia or doing other useful things, you see the time we waste with media today is enormous and far greater in the Hey day of Television. yeah we might all start changing and getting together and creating all kinds of things or we might still continue to waste a lot of time online and TV."
I don't know.
PETER NORVlG:
Okay let's go to questions.
NlCHOLAS CARR:
Start from this side.
MAN 1:
"I haven't read you book yet, but I have a question for you."
Part of growing up is making breaks in your past.
For me growing up was going away to school and then from school going to another school and from there going to another school and then finally moving away.
And going to start working.
And you took these points in my life and I had to choose who I was going to stay in touch with.
"One of the things with that the previous talk with the Facebook of that and these social networks, you have to choose who not to stay in touch with and how is that part of making us smarter and making us dumber in that conversation?"
"How is staying with the burden of your choices as a young person, is that holding people back?"
"And is that, I went through all these breaks before the internet and I'm sure you probably did to."
"""This is unbelievable information."""
"And as I began to move through this,"
I realized that we spend more on healthcare in this country than any other country in the world.
And that disease doesn't know party lines.
Cancer doesn't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat.
We spend 16 cents of every dollar in this country managing disease.
"And as I thought about that, I thought,"
"""None of us can do everything, but all of us can do something."""
"And right now, we've got this prototype, this new technology in our food supply."
"And I thought, it's kind of like the fax machine - you know, maybe it served its purpose there for a while, but the two products that it's brought us have allowed an increased spraying of weedkiller, and for something to produce its own insecticide, and maybe it's time for a new technology."
"Because right now, these farmers, they sign End User Agreements, where they have to license the use of this technology, they're charged royalty fees, trait fees, licensing fees."
I spent time with these guys on their farms - and this is not the farming that their grandfathers did.
"At the same time, the Department of Justice is investigating this stuff because of the monopolistic practices, the way that these seed companies can increase their prices five to ten percent in order to drive shareholder return."
"And while none of us can do everything, all of us can do one thing."
Because each and every single one of us has something that we are uniquely good at.
"And when you leverage that with something that you're passionate about, you can create extraordinary change."
"And as I leaned into this - you know people were trying to call me an activist, and they were trying to call me an advocate - and I just thought none of those terms hit me quite right, because I realized that this was so totally inspired by love."
"And I thought, what do you call people who are working and totally inspired by love to restore the health of our country, and to create a better way?"
"And I realized that our country was founded on that spirit, and that you really simply call us citizens."
"And so I invite you to lend your talents, to find a friend, so that together, we can create the change that we want to see in the health of our families, and the health of our food system, and in the health of our country."
Thank you.
(Applause)
"hehehe, yeah baby ! alright then... what are your thoughts on driving the car? what is your reaction?"
"Very possibly, the fastest car I've ever been in - unbelievable unbelievable - really like a rock, specially that second gear shift it is like the front wheels come off the ground,"
"I think, i'm speechless - it is amazing !"
Not bad for a car that was engineer to try to be efficient - yeah
Yeah - Close the mind !
No reason why efficiency has to be boring.
That much is clear...
Wait!
The crates from the Juarez are in the hold.
We gotta get to a phone.
"You may say, ""But the water is cold!"""
You need to understand that there is nothing that is not energy
"### and the water, no matter how fast it is occurring internally, is energy. ###"
"Put your hand into the cold water, then get some warm water and put your hand into the warm water, and try to feel."
"If you are somewhere that windy hard, try to learn with the wind, to feel the wind."
"There is one thing we don't pay much attention, but our chakras work with types of energy."
"For example, the sex chakra, what kind of energy does it work with?"
"It works with dense energies, it will work with pasty energies, right?"
"It will work with energies like the wind, it works with that energy."
Any energy that touches your body is identified by your sex chakra.
"So, these are the energies that sex chakra will deals with."
"For example, water is a liquid energy, but it can handle that energy, it responds to it."
This answer will be better defined according to the competence of your chakra.
"So if you take, for example, the coronary chakra, it does a very different reading than sex chakra."
"If you, for example, touch the water, the same water you are touching with your hands, to feel the sex chakra, pour a bit of this water over your head and try to feel."
Perhaps you'll be able to perceive the difference that exists in the perception of each chakra.
"You may say ""But I'm using my hands"""
"No, you can use the foot, you can use any part of the body."
"But when I'm talking about coronary chakra,"
"I'm certainly speaking about the farthest chakra of sex chakra, where perceptions are different."
"If you do something with the other chakras that are close to the sex chakra you'll not be able to fell, you'll not be able to perceive the difference."
"So, sex chakra and coronary chakra, will provide different perceptions."
You can also perceive this when the wind touch on your face.
"Feel the wind on your face and then feel the wind on your legs, check if there is a difference in perception."
"If you are very emotional, this difference hardly appears."
"If your consciousness is already at heart chakra, at the top or above, it becomes very clear."
"It's the same process for a person who is clairvoyant, when a person can see more images and distinguish better than someone else."
"So if you show someone a landscape, that landscape can be read in many ways."
"A person who is very advanced level, the reading of everything is much more acurated."
It's like you looking at a person.
"If you look at a person, the person is composed of many items."
Someone will look and not see anything and the other will see many details in that person.
"You didn't get that parking ticket that irked you so much... or you, unfortunately, never met your wife."
Anything that is physically possible actually does occur... in some other parallel universe.
"It means that in one universe, Elvis Presley is still alive."
In a different level-one universe...
George W. Bush is the baseball commissioner.
Or perhaps we don't exist at all in some of these universes.
The implications are staggering.
And if the universe is infinite... and there really are all these level-one universes... in the infinite multiverse... all those other possibilities did somewhere happen.
"Technically, there are a couple of ways mathematically... for the universe to be truly infinite... but, essentially, it must be shown to be flat."
The universe seems to be perfectly flat... which means either the universe is flat... or is curved so slightly that we can't see it.
"In this case, the universe would eventually curve back in on itself... and form a hypersphere."
It would then be finite in size and volume... and not flat and infinite.
Another way to look at this is that the universe... may have inflated so quickly and so enormously... that it only looks flat.
Think of a bug walking on a gigantic balloon.
"The larger the balloon, the flatter things get."
"The bug walks in any direction, and the bug says..."
"""Well, the universe seems perfectly flat to me."""
But from a distance... we see that the bug is walking on a gigantic balloon.
But now an amazing new tool... the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe or WMAP... is changing everything.
Some say the remarkable images reveal the true shape of the universe.
"What we have here are baby pictures of the universe... what it looked like when it was only 400,000 years old."
We're looking so far back in time... that the galaxies hadn't even formed yet.
"We just had this dead, diffuse gas which, gradually, overtime... clumped into galaxies, stars, planets."
The WMAP is catching the very earliest signs of creation.
"Officially, it is tasked with measuring radiation..."
left over from the Big Bang.
But now some scientists have devised an experiment... to calculate the overall shape of the universe.
"If I send light rays through space... and make a gigantic triangle, going from us here... out to the farthest edges of what we can see and then back... the angles of those- that triangle should add up to exactly 180 degrees."
If the universe is curved like a balloon... the angles of the giant triangle would add up... to more than 180 degrees.
To find out if the universe is flat or curved... they shot laser beams deep into space... and made a giant light triangle.
"Now we can tell, and the measurement is in... and the answer is, it works beautifully."
The angles add up to exactly 180 degrees.
Can you get enough players?
Can you get enough of the pieces to go?
"And if you offer a sufficiently compelling value proposition and a real differentiator, these things can grow big very quickly."
"I think the lesson of the Internet is that new businesses can grow very, very quickly when you get just the right combination of things and you get scale. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"And in the mobile internet, we have it. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Yeah.
We clearly have had that this year.
"And, by the way, we've been waiting for years, so we've talked about this for a long time."
"So, again, in the â€˜What's New,' I think it's finally there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Who would've thought that the best signet that could've ever happened to the mobile Internet is that the growth was constrained by the carriers in their decks for so long and that it would happen to get traction at the time when the economy was very tough? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"And one of the interesting things about the carriers is the carriers are looking for new sources of data revenue and, you know, you asked earlier about the netbooks?"
"Some of the carriers are saying, ""Well, why don't we subsidize all of these different kinds of devices in the same way that they do with mobile phones today?"" Everybody understands the mobile phone plans, and they're subsidized, and so forth, to get those things out of there."
"And, again, that's another new thing that I think will serve as an accelerant to an already exciting industry. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Any questions? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
Thanks.
Greg sort of crossed specific capital.
Mary mentioned Japan as really leading in the mobile Internet.
And I wanted to understand what you're optimistic about in terms of other countries that are coming along.
Certainly it's not this country.
"But other countries that you think would follow the footsteps of Japan with mobile advertising, other revenue?"
Second question is what is your venture capital and M&amp;amp;A strategy going forward? &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"With Japan, we have now partnerships, I think, with two of the three, or the three, depending on exactly how you define the leading mobile providers."
And the monetization is excellent.
"And so when you get it right, when you have the right ad product and the right search product on the right device and, of course, Japan, the products themselves are all different."
"Anyone who has spent their, tried to get your own phone to work on their networks, so we know that as a proof point."
And that's been true for a couple of years.
"So, we're now attempting to replicate those kinds of deals."
The obvious prize will be China because of the simple volume there.
"There's enough growth in CPMs and, basically, application use and wireless data networks in China that that's sort of the next really, really big one."
"The penetration for mobile devices in Europe is very strong, but the economies are not so strong."
We'll wait and see what happens there. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;SPEAKER:
You mentioned-- &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"The eyes, the jaw, the teeth: everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has."
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count.
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin in the computer.
But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.
"We went through this process, then, called retargeting."
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
"And here's the resulting data that comes from that, the model that comes from that."
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model.
"And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin was made from Brad, we could transpose the data of Brad at 44 onto Brad at 87."
"So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s."
Next we had to go into the shooting process.
"So while all that's going on, we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world."
"And we shot our body actors, and we shot them wearing blue hoods."
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
"And the blue hoods helped us with two things: one, we could easily erase their heads; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set."
But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles and he watched on the screen.
"His job, then, was to become Benjamin."
And so we looped the scenes.
He watched again and again.
We encouraged him to improvise.
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we didn't think he was going to go.
We shot him with four HD cameras so we'd get multiple views of him and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast.
From there we went into a process called image analysis.
"And so here, you can see again, the chosen take."
"And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87."
"And so, what's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis, which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face."
"And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow."
"And the software would tell us that, well, in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here, and it concludes moving in frame 32."
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from.
"And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to match the performance footage of Brad in live action with our database of aged Benjamin, the FACS shapes that we had."
"On a frame-by-frame basis, we could actually reconstruct a 3D head that exactly matched the performance of Brad."
"Now when my mother died and I had grief, it wasn't a negative emotion."
"Out of my grief came hope and inspiration, determination and respect and all those things you talked about."
"And when a loved one dies and we have grief, I think, I put it to you that we have grief because we have a connection, it's the spirit connection within us - it's that God part in us that connects with the"
God part of that other person.
So therefore it's the passing of the spirit.
That when we have grief over death it's about the passing of that spirit which we accept.
"So I put it to you that grief is not a negative emotion but it's intrinsic in the emotion of love because out of love comes joy and peace and patience and kindness, gentleness, prayerfulness, goodness and understanding and self-control."
"Now, in close, if you made a comment I'd appreciate it."
"But I've noticed that you've mentioned John Howard, now I respect John Howard because firstly as a father, he's been a great father, I'm a father, and secondly he's been a magnificent"
"leader to this nation for a long period of time, so I think we should respect him for who he is."
Ajahn Brahm:
I agree with you with respect yes.
"Okay, it's a long question there and usually I try to repeat this for the tape but that was too long a question to repeat it for and wouldn't actually catch it but the first thing, I'm just going to do this in brief."
The main question was about - is grief intrinsic to love?
"And I certainly thought that way when I was very young, but I know that I never had grief when my father died but I loved him very dearly."
"I couldn't understand why that was, and only later on when I went to Buddhist countries and spent nine years in the north-east of Thailand which unlike"
"Sri Lanka had not been, I would say influenced by ""Western"" civilisation."
"The West had never got to Thailand, or rather they never had colonised it."
"And so it was, what I could actually possibly call a pure Buddhist culture there."
And in the nine years I was there I never saw grief.
"And this was living in a village very close to those people, we were part of the family, and many times I saw people die."
The funerals were held in our monastery.
I never saw tears.
It wasn't part of their repertoire.
That proved to me was that grief is not intrinsic in the human condition.
There was a culture which didn't have it.
And it wasn't just the funerals.
"You'd see them afterwards, the next day, weeks, months, they were part of your family, the extended family of a monastery embedded in a couple of villages in the north-east of"
Thailand.
"And those people loved each other, but there is a another type of love, which is a love which will let go.."
Which will let a person go into a death.
"So grief is, and we're not saying that grief is wrong or bad."
"Not just ""kind of"", it's actually joining our ancestor as its being created and extending that relationship by joining with another instance of parent."
So you can kind of think of going down the ancestor tree adding relationships as we go down.
"Again, I really can't encourage you enough to download this query and play with it yourself to fully understand what's going on."
Let's go ahead and run it.
It's going to be rather anticlimatic.
"When we run it we do discover that these five people are Mary's ancestors, and if you've drawn the little tree of the data you can verify that, that's the correct answer."
Let's play around a little bit.
Let me try a few other people's ancestors.
Let's try Frank.
We don't see Frank here because
"Frank actually happens to be a child of Mary's, so we should get even more ancestors when we run this one, especially"
"Mary should be included, and in fact, she is, there she is, and these are Frank's ancestors."
"Let's try George, I think"
George was somewhere in the middle of the tree there.
"Yes, George has three ancestors, and finally let's try Bob."
"Bob is at the root so we should get an empty result and we do, because again Bob has no ancestors in our database."
Now lets take a look at our second example.
"That was the one where we had a hierarchy of management chain in a company, and then we were interested in computing the total salary cost of a project, so I've set up our three tables."
"The first one is the Employee table, it just gives the IDs of the employees and the salary of each employee."
The second table is the Manager relationship.
"So, again, you might want to draw the little tree here although it's pretty simple this time."
"123 is at the root of our little management structure, as 234 as a subordinate."
"234 has two subordinates, 345 and 456 and 345 is another one."
So it's only a three level tree.
Of course if we knew it was only three levels we wouldn't need recursion at all.
But we're going to write a query that will work for arbitrary numbers of levels.
So that's our management structure.
"And finally, our third table, the Project table says that employee 123 is the manager of project X, so what we want to do is find the manager of project"
"Y in the hierarchy,and then take that manager's salary along with the salary's of all the manager's subordinates recursively down to the management structure, and of course that's everybody in in our little database."
"Again, I can't encourage you to download the script and run it for yourself."
So here's our query to find the total salary of project x and I'm actually going to give a couple of different ways of running this for you.
The way we've done it the first time is to effectively expand the management structure into a relation called superior.
I think is a shame.
I would like this to be in the language -- or would have liked it to be in the language -- for two reasons.
One is the loop affordances it provides expect you're always going to exit either at the top or the bottom of the loop.
"I don't know if it's something weird about me, but I tend to exit out of the middle more often than"
I exit out of either end.
[laughter]
You can do that.
"Just say 'while true', which just looks stupid."
This is the more elemental thing.
The other is that it makes it easier to think about the language.
If this were the primitive loop statement and all of the others were simply variations on that then the language in its core would be smaller and easier to reason about.
"So when you're thinking about the language's security, you have less analysis to do."
I think that would be a useful thing.
"For example, we can take a while statement and de-sugar it into a simple loop statement."
You can see by the amount of de-sugaring it does that the while statement really isn't buying us very much.
We can do a similar thing with the do while statement.
"It's sort of interesting: while the 'do while' looks very different than the 'while' statement, what it does is actually almost identical."
The only difference is that it put the test on one end rather than on the other.
"Then when you look at what the 'for' statement actually does, it really doesn't do anything at all."
It just is complicated.
"Another way that you could think about doing iteration, another way of doing a loop, would be to use recursion."
"Another way that we could have transformed the while statement would be to turn it into a function which calls itself, and continues to call itself as long as the condition is true, with two restrictions."
"One is that because of the way functions work in JavaScript, you can't take any arbitrary code and put it inside of a body here."
"Arguments, this, break statements and return statements, the meanings of all of those change when you put them into a function, so you can't put them in the body here."
The other — more important — thing is that JavaScript does not implement tail recursion optimization
-- what people call proper tail calls.
"You can run for a while, and then it's going to start to slow down as it accumulates memory, and eventually it's going to fail."
You don't
like it when programs fail.
"I'm hoping that maybe someday in the distant future JavaScript would be enhanced to allow this, but it doesn't yet."
But that's not the kind of loop that I'm here to talk about tonight.
"I'm here to talk about event loops, because event loops are much more interesting."
"Normally, the first sound is slightly lower in pitch in comparison with the second sound."
"[normal first and second heart sounds, S1 and S2]"
Thank you.
Good morning.
We came here to do a presentation a bit more academic than the other two.
"Lorenzo Escot and I teach at the Complutense University of Madrid, and we have a research group that has spent years analyzing matters of gender equality, mostly in the labor market."
Our presentation is called:
"""Few women are directors because few men are caretakers""."
"Saying this, what we want is somehow, to address the question of why there is a presence so scarce of women, disappointingly, in the higher directive positions."
"After so many years, or so many decades of women having access to the labor market."
"For example, in companies listed in stock market, the IBEX-35, women in advising positions make up 8%."
"Their presence is still very low, and there are issues of permanence."
We wanted to address this type of issue but in a slightly different way.
"What we do is somehow go to the other side, why are there so few men who are caretakers."
"That is, men who have unpaid jobs, who work at home, taking care of kids, relatives, etc."
"Because we feel like, and the literature available proves it, that there is a high correlation."
"On the other hand, as we have been doing in our other two presentations, when we speak about gender matters, we're not speaking of women alone, we're talking about both women and men."
And they're interconnected.
"So the first point I'd like to deal with is, very briefly, what are the theories that explain why there still is a small presence of women in high positions in organizations."
One of the popular ones is the glass ceiling theory.
"""Glass ceiling"" refers to barriers, invisible barriers that limit the access of women to those higher positions within organizations."
I would also say that such barriers are external to women.
"And it has to do with matters such as, for example, not belonging to the networks or having the contacts that are necessary in order to plot."
One must plot to make it to the higher positions in an organization.
Maybe you need to play golf.
And women need to do certain things that they still do not normally do nowadays.
"For example, it also has to do with the lack of role models."
"This will disappear as time passes, but it's hard."
It's also related to stereotypes.
What are women good at?
What are men good at?
These are stereotypes related to social gender roles which have a great influence.
Every night!
"Something is seriously askew, and we should really talk about it."
"Right now, half of the total global wheat harvest is used as livestock feed to support our meat and dairy consumption."
"Half of the entire harvest, while, at the same time, people in poor countries are starving."
And there doesn't seem to be an end to this.
We keep on consuming more and more and more.
"And, in the future, we will have to exploit other people's natural resources even more than we do now."
"And this will be at the expense of those people, clean water, clean air and also our environment."
"So, let me sum this up for you."
Scientists say that it simply takes far more land and energy to produce animal protein than plant-based ones.
To produce animal products you need up to ten times as much land as is needed to produce vegetable products.
And this is due to the fact that all this land is needed to produce feed for these billions of farm animals.
Films like An Inconvenient Truth have made a very important contribution to the debate on global warming.
Yet the only cow that I saw on-screen symbolised little Al's picture-perfect youth in Tennessee.
In the whole Inconvenient Truth not a single word was said about
"livestock farming, or the impact of this polluting industry."
"Dr. Steinfeld, how is it possible that livestock doesn't play a role in the discussion about global warming?"
"Well, I think that the fact is that in the climate change discussion much of the focus is on carbon dioxide, and the carbon dioxide emissions if you look at the livestock sector only make up about one third of the total greenhouse gas emissions."
"Nitrous oxides and methane don't come very strongly into the debate, but they are much more potent in terms of greenhouse gasses and carbon dioxide and they need to be factored in."
But Al Gore didn't say one single word about the livestock industry in his documentary.
What do you think?
Didn't you miss the aspect as well?
It is certainly missing; the entire aspect of food is missing.
And I think that everyone needs to know that food and agriculture contributes to climate change and has environmental impact.
"And that one needs to make choices, if one wants to be environmentally friendly, that are in line with the environmental impact of producing various types of food."
"Well, I think that he should have said something about it."
Have you ever tried to convince him?
"Well, I'm not someone who knows Al Gore personally."
"I think that at my level publishing results and talking at conferences, and talking to the media such as in this case is all I can do."
"Well, thank you."
He doesn't know it either.
"So, I went to the United States to find an answer to this question."
And yet all the silver in the mines of Potosi couldn't help the inexorable economic and political decline of Spain's empire.
Why was that when Pizarro seemed to have struck it so incredibly rich?
The answer is that the Spaniards had dug up so much silver to finance their wars of conquest that the metal itself suffered an extraordinary decline in value.
More silver coins didn't make Spain richer.
They simply made prices higher as an increased quantity of money chased the same amount of goods.
What the Spaniards didn't get was that money is only worth what other people will give in exchange for it.
"And whether money takes the form of silver coins, sea shells, bars of gold, or bank notes, that's been true from Ancient times right down to the present day."
Even lumps of clay can work better than silver coins if people have enough confidence in them.
"In Ancient Mesopotamia, nearly 4 000 years ago, people used clay tablets, like these ones, to commit themselves to particular financial transactions."
"For example, this one, found a little southwest of Baghdad, specifies that a debtor will repay a lender 330 measures of grain on the harvest day."
But this one's even more fascinating because what it says is that a debt of 4 measures of barley should be repaid to the bearer of the clay tablet.
And it's that idea of repayment to the bearer that really fascinates me.
"If the phrase sounds familiar, then it should."
Just take a look at the 20 pound note.
Bank notes have next to no intrinsic worth.
"They're simply promises to pay just like the clay tablets of Ancient Babylon, 4 millennia ago."
"On the back of the 10 dollar bill, it says ""In God We Trust""."
But it's not really God you're trusting in.
"By swapping your goods or your labour for a fistful of these things, you're trusting the U.S. Treasury Secretary not to repeat Spain's mistake and produce so many of the damn things that by the time you come to spend them, they're worth even less than the paper they're printed on."
"Today, we're quite happy with paper money."
"Even more amazingly, we're happy with money we can't even see."
Millions of dollars pass through this woman's hands every day.
"Or rather, across her computer screen."
"She's a foreign exchange dealer, whose business is literally buying and selling money."
"Each day, around $3 trillion changes hands in transaction like these around the world."
And it's all built on trust.
It has to be when you can't even touch the stuff.
That's what the Conquistadors got wrong.
"They failed to see that money is about trust, even faith; trust in the person paying you the money; trust in the central bank issuing the money; trust in commercial bank that honours the cheque."
Money isn't metal.
It's trust inscribed.
"And it doesn't much matter what it's inscribed on-- paper, silver, clay, or a screen-- provided the recipient believes in it."
Statistics is different.
It is much more clear how gender matters get involve.
If we come to the conclusion that discrimination based on statistics is the one that is relevant in this case.
"We would continue by thinking what we can do so that we grant men access to care taking activities under the same conditions, family, children, basic domestic responsibilities."
"We must assume that most men would be ready to take it up, and many are already doing it."
"Not focusing on a gender war or something alike, but accepting that is a tendency that is also there."
What could we do to speed it up?
"From an economic policy point of view, what could be done?"
And here we have a list of suggestions.
"For us, the first of them is absolutely compulsory."
"That is, to equal the duration of maternity and paternity leaves, something that they're doing already in some other countries,"
"like in Nordic countries, Germany, even in Portugal!"
"Here it's starting, but we have a long road to go."
"We may take as an example the law, that some times sets an example."
"Sometimes, what laws say end up having an influence on our values."
"In this case, what does the law say in relation to parental leave?"
It says that when we have a child mothers have 16 weeks to take care of the children and fathers have only 2.
The law makes the father role look less important.
In such an important moment as that.
"Because many men find out what is taking care and what are egalitarian attitudes at that very same moment, when they really start getting involved, when they take care of their own children."
"It is a key moment, but here the law says no that this is mainly a woman's thing."
"Plus, it is the only legal discrimination based on gender that is left in Spanish law."
"We believe that if we don't change this, no matter what deadline we set."
We should change it to a month.
"We were supposed to pass this law in January, but it has been postponed due to budget deficit."
This is a key point for us.
The next one is the elimination of the gender bias in the reconciliation of work and family life.
"Sorry, did I go overtime?"
(Audience) No.
"The gender bias or feminine bias, regarding reconciliation in companies."
This is also very interesting for us.
"Through studies about reconciliation of work and family life we have observed that sometimes, human resources departments in companies only think of it as a need of their women workers."
"I got 5,000 unknowns, I've got, 500 constraints, you know what?"
"Four and a half thousand of these are going to just be zero, I know that from the beginning."
Have to pick out which ones.
"But if you did a histogram, you could see this big spike, of information zero."
"Its going to try to set, four and a half thousand things to zero."
"Its not going to try, it will set, and its going to pick 500 things to be non-zero that satisfy this and give you this small L norm."
"Okay, Promotes sparsity and the fact is you know there's sparsity in the signal, okay."
In this section we're going to talk about celiac disease and the gluten free diet.
So what is celiac disease?
Celiac is an autoimmune disease.
"It's also called gluten sensitive enteropathy, or celiace sprue."
"In celiac disease, gluten, which is a component of food, leads to villus atrophy, in the small intestine."
"The only therapeutic approach that has been known to treat celiac disease effectively, is maintenance of and adherence to a gluten-free diet."
Here's a picture of what villus atrophy
looks like.
On the left-hand side you can see what a normal healthy small intestine looks like.
"You notice all of these finger-like projections, the villi, which is where the majority of nutrients are absorbed."
"In celiac disease, the presence of gluten in the foods cuts down the height of the intestinal villi, and you end up with this flattened surface, like you see here."
"A flattened surface like this, cannot effectively absorb nutrients."
And so the people who have celiac disease end up having a variety of deficiencies of micro nutrients.
"Not to mention, absorption problems that often times result in things like diarrhea."
How prevalent is celiac disease?
Well researchers go back and forth about just how many people we think have it.
"One of the problems is, many people who have celiac disease are not diagnosed."
"In the US, historically, we've said that the rates are 1 in 133, there's other statistics that suggest it might be more"
like 1 in 100.
"In Europe, it's somewhere between that amount, and it's even higher in individuals who have a first degree relative."
"So the likelihood is that you have a 1 in 22 chance, of having celiac, if you have a first degree relative with it."
"Again, one of the problems is, that very few people who have celiac disease are actually ever diagnosed."
"We're seeing increasing rates of diagnosis with celiac disease, not because more people are getting it, but because the testing mechanism is more sensitive and more specific."
"And to be honest, practitioners are looking for celiac more now than they did previously."
A study that was done recently in the
A good example of a house in a more rural part of Connecticut.
"So keep these things in mind as you're thinking about your own behavior, the way you grew up, and you try to consider how your lifestyle choices influenced your family's consumption level."
"Also, I want you to think about the idea of size, and how we are increasingly dependent upon many consumer products in our lives that are larger than they used to be."
And housing is no exception.
"So that the average house size in 2009 is grown to about 2,500 square feet, with about two point three on average people per house."
That's really pretty remarkable.
"So you know, roughly 1,000 square feet per person."
"Whereas back in 1950, the average number of people in a house was much closer to three, a little bit over three with the post-World War II baby boom, with a total size of 800 square feet."
So the house size has grown by three fold.
"In 1970, it grew to 1,500 feet."
So the energy demands of a larger house like that are actually quite difficult to predict if you try to take into account the diversity of building materials.
"Boy, I apologize for this."
"And, you know, one of you might go outside and"
let them know that there's a lecture going on in here.
That would be really nice.
The construction is creating also diesel fumes inside the building.
Many of the garages that you find in suburban areas also have grown in size.
So here's an example of a garage that is actually larger than the average house size was back in 1950.
"This is probably about a twenty-two, twenty-three by thirty foot house."
"So that's roughly 1,200 square feet, pretty interesting."
Now think about the way that space is laid out.
So here's a studio apartment on the right hand side.
"And you see a dining table, a kitchenette, walk-in closet and a bath on the upper level."
Whereas the base level is dominated by a garage.
So that we're allocating less space indoors to our bedrooms than we are to our auto storage areas.
"Also, many buildings are now constructed with much more glass in them than previously."
And the newer high-end buildings are using special glass that is designed to reflect radiation so that it's not absorbed.
But different glasses are really designed for different climatic regions so that some are more efficient at reflecting radiation that are used in southern climates that are warmer.
"And others are more efficient at providing insulation, so they've got a barrier in the interior that basically protects against heat loss."
"So that overall though, buildings' increased use of windows has created increased energy demands."
Also lighting.
And also the way that we have increasingly designed bathrooms to have more than one fixture.
"So because you can't control the people, you feel like well, I'll spend more attention on the things that I can control, the execution time, the amount of storage being used, if it's crashing or not, if it's reproducible."
"And it's not entirely true that people aren't controllable because really, what we're fundamentally dealing with is two information processing machines."
"And that's of course, the CPU and the brain."
"And in some ways, they're very similar, they're both doing computation, one parallel processing, the other one massively parallel."
"One's base2, the other one's based on action potential, so you have dramatically more computational power."
But where they start to be different is we know exactly how computers work.
"We can go back and talk to a lot of people that were kind of instrumental in the field, it hasn't been that long."
"So computer scientists, there's things they're still discovering about how to make things efficient, but it's not"
like there's any part of the machine we don't understand yet.
"Whereas if you talk to someone doing neuroscience or cognitive science, you say, how does the brain work?"
"They have to kind of shrug and say, we're still trying to figure that out."
And that's OK.
We don't have to have a complete knowledge of how the brain works to still have predictable results.
There's enough that we understand about it that we can rely on to get those predictable results.
"So for the purpose of this talk, it's really kind of dehumanizing where we're going to treat people like information processing machines."
"You might think, well no, I'm a special snowflake."
"And yes, you are."
"But you're also, for the purpose of this talk, a uniform snow processing machine."
So three aspects of a great interface.
"First, it needs to be self-describing."
"Secondly, you need to prevent errors, and then third, make users fast."
So we're going to dive into each of these.
"So starting out, self-describing."
"The first thing I want to talk about is this notion of mental model, and a mental model is basically a simulation of reality inside of your mind."
"So to pose a question, how many instances of this talk are happening right now?"
"And of course, the answer is one."
It's right there.
The photons are bouncing off the screen at you.
"And when you're in a big room, you've got the talk there, and that's reality."
"But then on another side, you have the fact that everyone is interpreting the talk in a simulation of the room inside their own head."
"So you have all these simulations going on, and these are the mental models they're building of the reality around them."
"So this is very sort of dystopian movie, maybe we're all in our little pods and we don't know it."
"Three hops to G, one, two, three."
Yep.
There's no faster way to get to G.
"This actually does the right thing in terms of number of hops, but let's take a look at what happen when we went to expand B."
"At this point, even though we have a shortest hop path to B, we don't have a shortest link path to B."
"All we know is that from A, you can reach C in three steps."
"Well, that's really all we know."
"Even this A to D, we don't know, there might be like a half weight path that goes from C to D, but we do know that there's going to be no faster way to get to C right because that is the shortest edge out of A."
Any of the longer edges we're assuming we can't take negative weight edges that would cause this four to get smaller than the three.
All we really know is that this three is the smallest.
"What we should do is not expand B, but we should focus on C."
We now know that there's a path that actually can get us there in 13.
This 10 edge plus the three that it takes to get to C.
We can get to B faster than 15.
We can get to B in 13.
"Now, is that the shortest possible path for B?"
"We don't know cause we know that we could get to D in four and maybe there's a link one,"
I mean ignoring the graph for a second.
"Maybe, there's a link one path that would get us to B, which would be even shorter."
All we know from what we've done so far is that the shortest path from A to D is four.
"Let's lock that down and pull D off of the open list, and let's focus on D."
"D has edges to B, F, and E. Here's B, and here's F and E."
"This path to F through D is going to add another seven for a total of 11, and this path to E through D is going to add another three for a length of seven, and remember there's also a D to B link, which would add nine to this, which would get us there in 13, and we already knew how to get there in 13, so that doesn't really change anything."
"Based on these three, we know the fastest way to A, C, and D, and once that we have also been able to reach, we know that E has the shortest distance, which is seven, and there isn't going to be any faster way to get to E cause there aren't any other nodes that we could get to and then get to E faster than seven."
"We can lock that one down, pull off the open list, add all its edges to the non-completed nodes."
"E can go to F, and it has a link of five."
We could go seven steps to E and then another five to F for a total of 12.
"No, we can already get there in 11."
That's probably not a good idea.
"From E, we can also get to G in one step, which would have been seven plus the additional step for a total of eight, and that's all we can reach from E."
"Looking things over, we now know that the fastest way to get to G is eight steps because the only other way we could get to G would be to visit one of the other nodes, and then go to G, and that would have to be longer than eight."
"We're going to lock it down, and now we pull of the open list and look at the edges out of G."
"Yeah, but this was not just any frog."
"Unlike a normal frog, which lays its eggs in the water and goes away and wishes its froglets well, this frog swallowed its fertilized eggs, swallowed them into the stomach, where it should be having food, didn't digest the eggs, and turned its stomach into a uterus."
"In the stomach, the eggs went on to develop into tadpoles, and in the stomach, the tadpoles went on to develop into frogs, and they grew in the stomach until eventually the poor old frog was at risk of bursting apart."
"It has a little cough and a hiccup, and out comes sprays of little frogs."
"Now, when biologists saw this, they were agog."
"They thought, this is incredible."
"No animal, let alone a frog, has been known to do this, to change one organ in the body into another."
And you can imagine the medical world went nuts over this as well.
"If we could understand how that frog is managing the way its tummy works, is there information here that we need to understand or could usefully use to help ourselves?"
"Now, I'm not suggesting we want to raise our babies in our stomach, but I am suggesting it's possible we might want to manage gastric secretion in the gut."
"And just as everybody got excited about it, bang!"
It was extinct.
"I called up my friend,"
Professor Mike Tyler in the University of Adelaide.
"He was the last person who had this frog, a colony of these things, in his lab."
"And I said, ""Mike, by any chance --"" This was 30 or 40 years ago."
"""By any chance had you kept any frozen tissue of this frog?"""
"And he thought about it, and he went to his deep freezer, minus 20 degrees centigrade, and he poured through everything in the freezer, and there in the bottom was a jar and it contained tissues of these frogs."
"This was very exciting, but there was no reason why we should expect that this would work, because this tissue had not had any antifreeze put in it, cryoprotectants, to look after it when it was frozen."
"And normally, when water freezes, as you know, it expands, and the same thing happens in a cell."
"If you freeze tissues, the water expands, damages or bursts the cell walls."
"Well, we looked at the tissue under the microscope."
It actually didn't look bad.
The cell walls looked intact.
"So we thought, let's give it a go."
What we did is something called somatic cell nuclear transplantation.
"We took the eggs of a related species, a living frog, and we inactivated the nucleus of the egg."
We used ultraviolet radiation to do that.
And then we took the dead nucleus from the dead tissue of the extinct frog and we inserted those nuclei into that egg.
"Now, by rights, this is kind of like a cloning project,"
"like what produced Dolly, but it's actually very different, because Dolly was live sheep into live sheep cells."
"That was a miracle, but it was workable."
So what we are seeing is that maybe we're just discounting kids too early and we are assessing them at the wrong times.
And it is kind of a predetermined future if you do it that way.
Tom:
How did we loose our way in this country when it came to science education?
Tom:
How did we loose our way when comes to science education in this country?
"When I was a younger guy, the Russians were beating us into Space so a lot of people went into Engineering, went into Sciences."
The Space Race helped accelerate all of that.
"But then we lost our way, it seems to me, in the last part of the 20th century."
Sal:
"You know, I think that it has just been bad branding."
"I think, you know its funny, because Science and Engineering are fundamentally creative professions."
"I mean 'engineering', the word 'engineering' is to build things that have never been built before."
"And the way it's shown and the way, and all of the hoops that you have to jump through in your education, make it look like its a non-creative field, but when you look at it in the real world, it is a very creative field."
"So I think the real thing is to get more kids engaged, to show them that 1) the math and science itself is beautiful and it tells us more about the universe, or as much about the universe, as philosophy or anything else."
"It really is a form of philosophy and not only that, but the end point you're going to isn't a boring job."
"It is a creative job, it is redefining what people's experiences are."
"I think that if you do it that way,"
I think that a lot of more people will want to get into it.
Tom:
"I take of Cyber Space is the new second 'Big Bang', we're creating this new universe our there, just like we did with the physical first bang."
"And one of the things that's happening is that we're watching all these planets which one is going to drift too close to the sun, which ones are going to form together and form new lifeforms."
"As you look at your model which has been successful, have you already began to think: how can we expand that model to other areas?"
Sal:
"Yeah, we've already thought about it."
"So you know that we have the videos I do right now and we have this whole software platform and I think the interesting thing is we are going to start branching off from mathematics, our videos already cover the things in biology and economics and all the rest."
"But our exercise platform: try to do economics, physics, chemistry, and then start to think about how can we do the humanities?"
How can we give people the basic scaffold of say American History?
"And then I think it would be really interesting to see how we can do things like creative writing, where people are doing projects and maybe they can peer review each others essays and things like that."
I think that there is a whole universe that we are just beginning to explore.
Tom:
Well we look forward to your exploration.
"Then, it is simply a question of, are your risky or you're unrisky? it's more complex than that."
"So, as an example of risk and risk perception and acceptance we can take a look at Facebook. this was a firm started by a college student in the U.S. in 2004 that was based initially on an idea that he had in high school. he'd launched this social networking platform at Harvard."
"Within two weeks, had half the student body signed up."
Quickly grew that to 30 other colleges in the region.
Moved to Silicon Valley.
"Partnered with Sean Parker of Napster, and really began to grow in scale the firm."
"They were able to go out and successfully raise some venture capital in the context of, initially,"
Angel Investment.
"And then later, larger traditional VC funding at evaluation of $100 million shortly after the firm was launched."
"So, very rapid growth."
"They continued to grow the firm and expanded it into serving high school students, and expanded their feature side as well of photo sharing."
"They then raised significant rounds of funding thereafter, and had a much greater val uation."
"Shortly before this, the firm was viewed as being worth $100 million based on future profit potential, and now they are over $500 million."
"And they were supporting anyone with an email account, and so they have grown from the college niche to high school, to now anyone that wanted to be a member."
"They then were offered a $750 million to be acquired, to be bought, to be owned by Viacom, and Mark"
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"Earlier that summer, they had a $one billion."
"Shortly thereafter, Viacom attempted to acquire the company for 750 million."
Zuckerberg and the Facebook team declined.
"A few months later, a billion dollar offer, declined."
"The following year, Microsoft $240 million investment for 1.6% of the company making Facebook worth $fifteen billion based on that investment."
"500 million members signed, and one billion in revenue achieved."
And all of that happened in a span of approximately six years.
"So, in that way, what we see is rapid growth and to grow the company at such a high scale. there were multiple opportunities to be bought and to be acquired that were turned down, and the expectation of the Facebook team is that there were greater upside ahead."
"So, with that, when we look at risk it's easy to be risky when the stakes are low."
"But, when you are working in a high stake situation, we want to think about, well, again what are we risking?"
Is it financial?
Is it safety?
Is it ethics? so all of these certainly play a role.
"Within entrepreneurs, there's not an element of, again, seeking risk but it's more about perception and capability and what they see as a relative return."
"So, when we look at entrepreneurial motivation this is certainly central to understanding how entrepreneurs make decisions and how they perceive risk."
And there are three factors involved with that.
"But it's green, we did teach them about traffic lights, and next to a lock, a metaphor."
"So even if they don't get it totally right, its sort of placement and the various things that it conveys, they might get close enough to say, well, it probably means that this is better somehow."
So they're able to bootstrap conceptually just up enough.
"Or another example, this one more visual."
"We bring them in and we say, what does this application do?"
"And they're going to say, it's very pretty."
"And then they're going to say, I don't know, because while this icon is pretty, also I think, did you work on this one?"
MALE SPEAKER:
No.
ALEX FAABORG:
All right.
"For the designer in the room who worked on this, I'm sorry."
"It's a great icon, but it does not convey to the user in this test chamber with access to no other knowledge, what it actually does."
"It is a great application, though."
"It's shipped on all the devices you guys have, you should check it out."
I use it everyday.
This is Currents.
So what does this app do?
They're not going to know.
"So I would argue that success in these situations, it doesn't have to do with their intelligence, it has to do with access to information."
Is that information embodied in the thing that they're using?
"So quickly you're thinking, all right, well, what if I don't have this underground testing facility?"
That sounds really expensive.
"And that's true, and this is controversial, it's especially controversial for any user researchers in the room, or user researchers watching later."
"But I would argue while it's really, really useful to have access to user researchers, you don't absolutely have to rely on them."
"You could just start running user tests in your own head, basically short-term amnesia."
"What you have to do is you have to kind of encapsulate your mind, you have to start thinking, forgetting the things that you know about your interface, try to look at it with fresh eyes, try to think, OK, I've never seen this thing before, which is hard because you have seen it before, really, really hard."
"But if you can do that, if you can look at it with fresh eyes and try to have all the assumptions fall away that you've already built up, then you're able to do that kind of user test just on yourself quickly right then."
"And if you're just regularly doing that, it's going to really improve your applications."
I think this is one of the most important things that I can convey.
"But obviously, you're going to be more familiar with the underlying implementation because you are literally building it."
"In the case of a clock, you are probably intimately familiar with each of the gears and how they fit together and all of these details, but you have to just"
"Likewise, the things behind you,  those are redshifted, and those look like they move more slowly."
Now that's all 99.9% but it's not faster than the speed of light.
The idea of warp drive is something that physicists have absolutely  thought about.
"In what we call Einstein's  Special Theory of Relativity, it is simply impossible."
That was his 1905 theory about space and time being together.
But then in 1916 Einstein said that space and time can be warped.
So we realized more recently  that you can imagine warping space-time in a little bubble around you  and have that bubble move in such a way that to an outside observer it looks like  you're moving faster than the speed of light.
"However it looks, we're not sure, but it looks like this  is not actually possible in the real world."
To make this happen would require tremendous amounts of energy and some negative amounts of energy.
So you would need an enormous  space-time warping field around you and we don't know how to make the kind of negative energy that it would require.
So the smart money is that there is  no warp drive in the real laws of physics.
"But we don't yet have a proof, we're working on it you should check back  to see where things go."
"The next question is, ""If you did travel  faster than the speed of light,"
"""would you be able to visit the past"
"""or if an object were moving faster than the speed of light,"
"""would it look like it was in the past?"""
And this is a great question because this goes right to the heart of Einstein's way of looking  at space and time versus Newton's way  of looking at space and time.
"Before Einstein came along, Isaac Newton  had laid down the law about space and time."
"They were both fixed,  separate, and absolute."
"And what that means is that if you know  that it's 2 pm right here, right now, you can say it is also 2 pm on Alpha Centauri 4 lightyears away."
"It's also 2 pm in the Andromeda Galaxy, and so forth."
That's Newton's way of looking at the world but then Einstein comes along  and says there's no such thing as what time it is right now in some far away place.
"It's not that there's no such thing, it's more that it depends on who's asking the question."
"So to you, there's something  called 2 pm on Alpha Centauri but to somebody else moving  at some speed relative to you, what counts as 2 pm on Alpha Centauri is completely different."
"And what that means is  if you could travel faster than light, in Einstein's universe — and he says  you can't and he's probably right, you probably can't."
"But if you could, imagine you said,"
"""I was able to move so fast that I got to Alpha Centauri 5 minutes from now."
"""It only takes me 5 minutes to get there."""
"What that means is that, from someone else's point of view, you went from here, now, to Alpha Centauri some time before you left, some time in the past."
"So according to Einstein,  if he has the last word and we're never sure about that,  if he has the last word, then the ability to go faster than the speed of light is the same as the ability  to go backwards in time."
You could go faster  than the speed of light and come back and you could come back before you left.
Now we don't think that there's anything that actually does that in the universe.
"Oh, I made some new observation and I'm going to go straight to write a wiki article about it."
You can write about it but first you have to submit it to some say journals or conferences.
Go through the peer review process that is based on scientific merits and back and forth.
And then once it appears in some external link then you can write about that in the wiki entry. .
"The third of policy is abbreviated as NPOV, a neutral point of view."
"And unlike verifiability and no original research, neutral point of view is much harder to enforced, cuz it's not as."
Clear cut as to whether this policy is observed or not.
"But roughly speaking, it says that, if you read an article, you should not be able to tell."
What kind of people wrote it?
"For example, in U.S."
"Political articles, you should not be able to tell, is it a Democrat or a Republican who wrote this article?"
"So the article must appear as, as objective and neutral as possible to the point that you cannot easily identify the kinda label."
To the people who wrote this article.
There're also quite a few other mechanisms here including having a history page where a few people would click that page but you can always check that out.
Every single edit in the entire history of that hardcore is stored and you can check that for yourself.
There is also talk page for discussion among the contributors and the editors.
There is reputation system.
"If you enter using your ID then there's a reputation system of no ID, if you don't then there's a reputation system of the IP address."
"Later, in lecture thirteen we will talk about internet IP architecture but basically, this is the address of the device that you use to enter your articles."
And then there is a hierarchical community.
"There are many, many contributors."
And then there's a small set of people who are editors.
And then there is a even smaller subset of that who are more senior editors.
"And they form like, juries."
And they will debate and discuss and try to form rough consensus.
On articles where the contributors hold a very different opinions.
"And eventually, it can pop up to the highest level of committee to debate and discuss."
"So thanks to these policies and guidelines and thanks to these mechanisms, some of these challenges faced by Wikipedia has been quite successfully tackled."
"So now what we want to go into more detail is how this, this kind of committee operates."
And they operate it based on two kinds of mechanism.
"One is bargaining, and one is voting."
Prof:
"In 5 years' time, I wish each of these kids will probably have access to a cell phone that would be more powerful than the computer you own."
I would say that you can make the case that the future of the world depends on what they see on that cell phone.
"Will they be looking at trivia, pornography, incitations to violence?"
Although some of them get to look face-to-face at some of the world's greatest teachers speaking to them in the language that they can understand.
They can give them information they need to come out of the poverty to realize their true potential.
They might be in here.
"They might be the next Einstein or the next Gandhi, the person who will save the planet for our grandchildren."
How does that happen?
I can't make that happen.
"But, maybe, just maybe, we can."
"And, certainly today is a really exciting start."
"So, thank you to each of you."
(Applause)
this is representing the earth
Okay !! and this represents ... what do yo think?
"The moooon yes , our first challenge is how far apart are they"
like roughly.
Like roughly? about that much.
Okay.
I guess may be not that far about that far? yeah yeah may be that far.
"about like that? ha ha may be I guess, yes"
May be that may be that
like this far ?
"I feel its like here, somewhere right there?"
alright alright lets lets....
I am just going to stand here
Can I ?
Yeah yeah go ahead how does this far sounds like these are some images I found: on a Google image search for the earth and the moon diagrams that are not to scale are pretty common and I understand why we make them so you can show that detail without showing all that uninteresting space in between but they can have a problematic effect on learning because they give people the wrong idea about the relative proximities of things now if we want to talk about the distance between the Earth and the moon its actually...
its about here think about this.
It takes light one second to go from the earth to the moon takes eight minutes for light to travel to the Sun and four years to go to our nearest star then consider that there are 100 billion stars in our galaxy and as far as we know a hundred billion galaxies in the universe say universe truly is bigger than we can imagine and certainly bigger than we can draw to scale
"We are asking forgiveness from our Lord in these times to forgive our mistakes and to count us from His sincere servants we are not able to carry these days orders because shaytan and our ego are standing in our way so we are asking forgiveness and asking Allah SWT to send us more power to become better servants to Him from the first man until the last one order came to the children of Adam AS believe believe in Allah and believe in akhirat life this was the duty of 124,000 Prophets they came to warn people and to tell them this Kalimat, to call them to Allah"
"He told them not to concentrate on this dunya, but to concentrate on akhirat life when we check from Adam AS until Muhammad ASWS this is what they did in this century people are running not to mention the name of Allah from small groups to organizations to governments running to stop the name of Allah and heedless 21st century people are running after them"
Hick's law is more interesting.
It's about solving for time based off of the number of choices and probability.
"It's been proven that if you simplify the Ul, people are going to be able to click on things faster."
"So the argument of, why don't we just introduce a button for that?"
It's because it has cost.
It literally makes interface less efficient if people have to search against it.
"So equation here, you have the number of equally probable choices, which first of all, no interface is going to have equal probabilities, so this form's bad."
What you actually want is summation with the probability of each one individually.
"And based off of that, you can determine when you have something lined up with others, what the access time is going to be as people try to locate the one that they're"
looking for and choose.
So the combination of things like Fitt's law and Hick's law goes into the field of cognitive modeling.
"And basically what this is, is predicting a performance assuming highly trained users."
"So unlike the self-describing section, here you're assuming that people know what everything is."
And it's purely about access time and how quickly they can target the control and get to it.
So a lot of this work is actually done.
"At NASA Ames, there's a really good group doing it right next to the Google campus, and they're primarily doing it for fighter pilots, actually."
"This is a simulator of the F35, and in this case, you obviously have really highly trained users because they know what every control does, and it's purely about visual access time and small controls and proximity to other small controls."
"But even for a standard interface, a mobile application or a desktop application, you could do this type of modeling to try to make sure things are super efficient, looking at the metrics."
So that's how to build great interfaces.
"But the things we talked about, self-describing, basically the user building a mental model and sort of simulating in their head how stuff works, preventing errors, making users fast, the idea of cognitive modeling."
That's how to make something really easy to use.
Show an example.
This is really easy to use.
"If you know you have to get to the other side, we talked about doors a bit, you know how to get there."
"You can assume the thing rotates, being inside a circle."
"There's no mode errors, because it only rotates in one direction, and it's easy to use."
It also looks like a human cheese slicer.
It is not a happy door.
"So that leads us to the second part, which is visual design."
Here's Christian Robinson.
CHRlSTlAN ROBlNSON:
"So not to contradict you, but I think that the design of that is actually really quite appropriate."
"How do we enter that feeling of resonance, how do we enter another person's being?"
"I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-old, the thing that came to my mind was,"
"""How do you come into her world?"
Is she thinking about me?
"Is she thinking about others?"""
"Well, it's hard to do that, so we had to create the technologies."
We had to basically step inside a body.
We had to see the world through her eyes.
"And so in the past many years, we've been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking."
"We can see, moment by moment, what children are engaging with."
"This is my colleague, Warren Jones, with whom we've been building these methods, these studies, for the past 12 years."
"And you see there a happy five-month-old, a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world: his mom, the caregiver, but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare."
"What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory, but in order for us to do that, we had to create these very sophisticated measures, measures of how people, how little babies, how newborns, engage with the world, moment by moment."
What is important and what is not.
"Well, we created those measures, and here, what you see is what we call a funnel of attention."
You're watching a video -- those frames are separated by about a second -- through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds.
"And we freeze one frame, and this is what the typical children are doing."
"In this scan pass, in green here, are two-year-olds with autism."
"So on that frame, the children who are typical are watching this, the emotion of expression of that little boy as he's fighting a little bit with the little girl."
What are the children with autism doing?
"They are focusing on the revolving door, opening and shutting."
"Well, I can tell you that this divergence that you're seeing here doesn't happen only in our five-minute experiment."
"It happens moment by moment in their real lives, and their minds are being formed and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers."
"Well, we took a construct from our pediatrician friends, the concept of growth charts -- you know, when you take a child to the pediatrician, and you have physical height and weight."
"Well, we decided we were going to create growth charts of social engagement."
We sought children from the time they're born.
"What you see here on the x-axis is two, three, four, five, six months and nine, until about the age of 24 months."
"This is the percent of their viewing time that they're focusing on people's eyes, and this is their growth chart."
They start over here -- they love people's eyes -- and it remains quite stable.
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months.
"Now, let's see what's happening with babies who became autistic."
It's something very different.
This shows the long-run expansion path for a firm.
"This shows how, as it produces different amounts of goods, it will choose different units of inputs."
"So for the first level of production, it chooses five machines and 10 workers."
"Then if it wants to double production, it chooses 10 machines and 20 workers."
"So if it wants to increase production by another 50%, it chooses 15 machines and 30 workers, and so on."
This is a linear expansion path.
"This says this firm is a production function, and prices are such that basically they always want these inputs in fixed proportions."
So it would be a fixed proportional expansion path.
"No matter how much you choose to produce, you always want to use twice as much labor as capital."
"However, that doesn't have to be the case."
So this long-run expansion path is going to be what becomes our underlying cost curve.
"This is where underlying cost curves are going to come from, and hopefully where supply is going to come from, is this"
long-run expansion path.
This long-run expansion path is going to show us how much more we have to spend to produce different amounts of quantity.
"Now in this case, what you see here is that you have these fixed proportions."
"That as you increase quantity, that the input portion stays the same, but that doesn't have to be."
"For instance, figure 9b, you can imagine a world where, as you produce more units, capital becomes less productive."
"So you want more and more labor, but not that much more capital."
So this might be the example of like McDonald's.
"If McDonald's wants to produce more burgers, ultimately there's only so many fryolators it can use."
"Ultimately, it needs more people to package up the burgers and sell them."
So you might think that capital becomes less and less productive.
"And as a given McDonald's franchise expands its sales, it might want to increase the ratio of labor to capital."
So this is a case where capital's becoming less productive.
"And as you see, as you expand production you're going to more labor and less capital."
"In other words, the marginal product of labor is still steep, and the marginal product of capital is flattening."
"So you want more and more labor, and not as much capital."
That's one kind of expansion path.
Figure 9c shows a different kind of expansion path.
Here's one where labor becomes less productive.
"So this might be, for example, something which is a mass production process, like producing automobiles."
"Where basically as you produce more and more automobiles, you need more and more machines to produce them."
"And soon enough, they start building this body of meanings, but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction."
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others.
"Well, this is a 15-month-old little girl, and she has autism."
"And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face, and she's quite oblivious to me."
"Imagine if I did that to you, came two inches from your face."
"You'd do probably two things, wouldn't you?"
You would recoil.
You would call the police.
(Laughter)
"You would do something, because it's literally impossible to penetrate somebody's physical space and not get that reaction."
"We do so, remember, intuitively, effortlessly."
This is our body wisdom; it's not something mediated by our language.
Our body just knows that.
And we've known that for a long time.
And this is not something that happens to humans only.
"It happens to some of our phyletic cousins, because if you're a monkey, and you look at another monkey, and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you, and that is considered to be a signal or threat, well, you are not going to be alive for long."
"So something that in other species are survival mechanisms, without which they wouldn't basically live, we bring into the context of human beings, and this is what we need to simply act, socially."
"Now, she is oblivious to me and I'm so close to her, and you think, maybe she can see you, maybe she can hear you."
"Well, a few minutes later, she goes to the corner of the room, and she finds a tiny little piece of candy, an M&amp;amp;M."
"So I could not attract her attention, but something -- a thing -- did."
"Now, most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people."
"Now, for this girl, that division line is not so clear, and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like."
"Now, remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences."
"What she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging, moment by moment, as she is isolating herself further and further."
"So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic, the brain determines who we're going to be."
"But, in fact, the brain also becomes who we are, and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction, this is what's happening with her mind, and this is what's happening with her brain."
"Well, autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders."
And it's a brain disorder.
It's a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born.
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism.
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled but there are those that are gifted.
There are those individuals who don't talk at all; there are those individuals who talk too much.
"Both of those are fighting against that continuous thing, the copying and the shuffling, and the inserting is there something about that flexibility of the rewiring that can kind of get us out of this some operations having to be slow because other operations are fast."
Question.
[Inaudible].
Yeah.
Why is space used for stacks when those are half?
Yeah.
"So in this case, right, depending on how you're modeling your stack, if it is with vectors, right, then you're likely to have the before and the after stack, both have capacity for everything, even when they're not used, right."
And so it's very
"likely that either right give 100 characters they're either on one stack or the other, but the other one might be kind of harboring the 100 spots for them when they come back."
"Or it could just be that you have the link list, which are allocating and de allocating but has the overhead of that."
"So it's likely that no matter which implementation the stack you have, you probably have about twice the storage that you need because of the two sides and the overhead that's kind of coming and going there."
So we will see the link list and we'll talk that guy through on
Friday.
I'll see you then.
"People are very, very aware of social feedback - like we're really tuned to this."
"And so things that can potentially harm your social standing can potentially impede your relationships with other people, these are things that we take very seriously."
"When we're sitting there in the context of that situation, we don't always respond like we should."
Now
I will put ECG sensors on you.
"We wanted to look at just how do people respond to social stress and we wanted to know how they respond physiologically to it, how they responded cognitively and how they respond subjectively."
"At the outset of the experiment, the first thing that people are doing is that we want to collect these baseline recordings of physiology."
To do that we need to affix these physiological sensors that monitor activity.
And so here is the ECG signal coming in.
What we're doing is looking at changes from their normal state.
"This is the skin temperature, and you see right here it's at 93.42 degrees."
So they were told to think about stress as a coping tool.
"Like, stress isn't bad, that these responses have evolved to help our ancestors survive, that if we didn't have these things we'd be doing worse."
So after this we tell them they're going to give a speech about their strengths and weaknesses.
"Ok, we are ready to begin."
Please tell us about your strengths and weaknesses as a person.
We will be evaluating your performance throughout the speech.
This is a very self-relevant speech.
"There, was another point that I wanted to make that now, Nih has a policy that if your paper is supported by them as part of a grant or contract The finished man even if the journal wants to charge money for downloading the paper, wha."
"After a year, NlH will put it on PubMed as a finished manuscript which may not have had the kind of copy editing that will finally."
Hm.
Appear in the journal.
But it'll at least be your final version of the manuscript.
"And so you'll be able to, to read papers that have been out for a year, even if, for no cost, even if the journal is the kind that wants to charge money for it."
"That is great, yeah."
"And if you could change one thing about the publication process, what would you change?"
"Well I had, when you asked me that question before, I got two things."
"First of all, I think there should be greater evaluation of negative findings, by both researchers and by The journals."
"You know a, you're gonn, when you do studies, you're gonna have this great idea that you think something is a cause or prevention of, of some disease."
And you're gonna do a study and it's not gonna pan out.
"That is the, that is the most common experience that we epidemiologists have."
"In fact and a graduate student here, who is doing a study of Metformin and in relation to risk of breast cancer because."
"It was some thought that this might be preventive, Agent for, you know for reducing the risk of certain kinds of breast cancer."
"And This is being done at, at Kaiser Permanete in our division of research."
"But It's looking like, and, and this is not final result."
But it's looking like that's probably not gonna turn up.
"What was hoped for or what was expected and naturally, the researcher is very disappointed in that, but you know, I say, you know, this is important to know too, that there's a negative finding."
So don't be Discouraged if you have a negative finding.
"It's important that, that get published and it's imp-, and, I wish journals would be more interested in, in publishing these, and, sometimes it, it, you know, a negative finding, if you want to get it out there, could be written in the form of a brief report which will take less journal space, it'll get higher priority so, I think that's, that is my main..."
Answer to your question.
"I, I also wish that there was greater ease in getting peer reviewers to review a paper."
Sometimes we have a list at the American Journal of Epidemiology and I sent a particular paper out to people who said this was their specialty or special interest and out of ten people who we sent it to only one agreed to review.
Oh wow.
"And we tried to get two and I was asked, you know, can you make a decision on just the one review because we can't just keep."
"Trying to get, with your."
"So, as, as a scientist and an author."
"Please accept the responsibility of being a reviewer, as well as a As an author, we've had some cases where."
"You know we've published papers by a certain author, and this author consistently refused to review papers."
And naturally they're not well regarded by the.
Mm.
We need to make sure that we do not harden our hearts to God's work.
"We need to make sure that we allow Him to work through us, work in us, and ultimately shape us and change us to be able to use the various gifts and talents that He's given us for His glory."
I hope you were blessed by this.
Have a great day!
Projectile Motion
In this AP maths interactive model we are going to take a look at the independence of the horizontal and vertical components of velocity.
And this will help us understand projectile motion.
"So I have a red ball and a blue ball, equal mass, and we are just going to let them drop under free fall."
So you can see that their motion is identical.
I will just go through that in slow motion.
At each frame the vertical motion there is identical.
I'm going to project the red ball horizontally at five meters per second.
Now vertically I haven't changed anything.
We will pressure up.
When I move through these frames in slow motion the vertical motion remains identical.
Take this point here.
"Even though the red ball's horizontal components of velocity is five meters per second and it's being projected towards the right, vertically nothing has changed."
Both balls still vertical components of velocity equal to minus six point four meters per second and they are both the same height.
I will reset again and this time I will change the horizontal velocity to eight meters per second.
"Once again, if I go through this frame by frame we see that the vertical motion of both balls is identical."
The only difference is the red ball has a horizontal component of velocity and it is being projected horizontally.
"What I will do this time, I will also give the balls an initial vertical velocity."
Both balls are going to be projected upwards at four meters per second.
Let's see that again in slow motion.
Frame by frame again we see that the vertical motion of both balls is identical.
The only difference is the horizontal component of the red ball's velocity.
And this is very important when we are trying to model projectile motion.
The horizontal and vertical components of velocity are independent and we can model them separately.
Narrator:
"Refrigerant leaks are the most common problem in an air conditioning system, and are usually the result of faulty hoses or rubber"
O-rings.
Large leaks are rare and require the system to be opened up for repair.
"So, not really legally trademark violation cos it's distinct enough but certainly perceived as unfriendly, awkward and difficult."
"That went on for a while, and Brendan and the rest of us posted something that said"
"""OK, you're right, we're gonna change the name we'll change it before we ship our next version."""
"That was a problem, because it meant that the version was ready to ship before we had a name for it."
"Shipping it with no name seemed like a loss of momentum,"
Brendan had made a commitment and we had a really intense emotional survival fight
"like a couple of weeks, I think it was a couple of weeks, to try to figure out what we were gonna call this thing."
"The developer, Ben,"
liked the idea of doing something with fire in the name.
So we went through a dictionary or a book
looking for all the words that started with fire that might make sense.
So we started going through them.
"On the side, we were doing a very professional process of thinking about ""oh, what does the browser mean?"
How do you develop a brand?
Is it navigation?
Is it freedom?
Is it these kinds of words?
What are the values you associate with it?
Is it trust or is it fun?
And there was this very professional process on the side.
"But the reality was the name was chosen when Ben had a list of words that started with fire, we started looking at the ones we liked, and then taking the ones we liked and looking to see which of them didn't have trademark problems."
And Firefox was the one.
It turned out it had a slight trademark issue but we were able to resolve that one.
"We also knew that it had a mascot, we could have an image that would be good and I think it might have been Asa who first found the Chinese red panda, that there really truly is an animal called the Firefox and it's adorable or whatever."
So there we were.
We picked the name and then were able to ship Firefox 0.8.
Seven!
Seven?
"Ok, seven."
So this would be in 2004.
"This is in the spring of 2004, we had the foundation for seven or eight months, we're burning through our money, we're trying to figure out how we're gonna support ourselves, we have a good size community, we have an office, a very funky sublet from some friends of the Mozilla project, who when the giant .com boom had gotten a lot more office space than they needed and so they'd given us this little funky sublet, there is one picture of it floating around if you've seen that picture of 10 or 12 of us at a table with the cables hanging down in the middle of it, it had no running water, you had to go back into the janitor's closet in the back of the building to get running water or to wash any dishes, we bought a portable dishwasher and we rolled it down to the janitor's closet to wash our margarine glasses, mostly."
"So we were finally able, in the midst of all of that, we have a name, we can ship our product."
"So, let me encode an ordering by a labeling of the vertices with the numbers one through N."
This is just to encode the position of each vertex in this ordering.
So formally there's gonna be a function which takes vertices of G and maps things to integers between one and N. Each of the numbers one through N should be taken on by exactly one vertex.
Here N is the number of vertices of G. So that's just the way to encode an ordering and then here's really the important property that every directed edge of G goes forward in the ordering.
"That is, if UV is a directed edge of the directed graph G, then it should be that."
The F value of the tail is less than the F value of the head.
"That is, this directed edge has a higher F value as you, as you traverse it in the correct direction."
Let me give you an example just to make this more clear.
So suppose we have this very simple directed graph with four vertices.
"Let me show you two different, totally legitimate topological orderings of this graph."
"So the first thing you could do is you could label S1,"
"V2, W3 and T4."
This corresponds to mapping these four vertices.
"Another option would be to label them the same way except you can swap the labels of, V and W. So if you want you can label V three and W two."
So again what these labeling meant to encode is an ordering of the vertices.
"So the blue labeling you can think of as encoding the ordering in which we put S first, then V, then W and then T. Whereas the green"
"labeling can be thought of as the same ordering of the nodes, except with W coming before V. What's important is that the pattern of the edge is exactly the same in both cases, and in particular, all of the edges go forward in this ordering."
"So, in either case, we have S with edges from S to V and S to W. So that looks the same way pictorially."
Whichever order V and W are in.
"And then symmetrically, there are edges from V and W to T. So you'll notice that no matter which order we put V and W in, all four of these edges go forward in each of these orderings."
"Now, if you're trying to put."
"V before S, it wouldn't work because the edge from S to V would be going backward, if V preceded S. Similarly, if you put T anywhere other than the final position, you would not have a topological ordering."
"So in fact, these are the only two topological orderings of this directed graph."
I encourage you to convince yourself of that.
Now who cares about topological orderings?
"Well this is actually a, a very useful subroutine this has been, come up in all kinds of applications."
"Really whenever you want a sequence, a bunch of tasks, when there's precedents constraints amongst them."
By precedents constraints I mean one task has to finished before another.
"You can think, for example, about the courses in some kind of undergraduate major, like computer science major."
"Here the vertices are going to correspond to all of the courses and there's a directed edge from course A to course B, if course A's a prerequisite for course B, if you have to take it first."
"So then, of course, you'd"
like to know a sequence in which you can take these courses so that you always take a course after you've taken its prerequisites.
"Now when you take your office as a doctor, if you want to see more patients in the short-run, they might be crammed into your office, and in the long-run you might build a bigger office."
"So in the short-run, how hard you work is variable."
"In the long-run, how big your office is is variable-- how many secretaries you hire, et cetera."
But your medical school spending is gone.
"That's not variable in the long-run, that's sunk."
"And that's a very important distinction is between basically these fixed costs, what we call fixed costs."
"Which are costs where, like the costs of the office and the machinery the physician uses, which can be changed over a 10-year period, versus sunk costs which once paid are gone forever."
"And the key reason, just to give you a hint about why these will matter, is because when firms set up this-- we may see firms in the market losing money."
You may see firms in the market losing money.
"In fact, in any point in time we see lots of firms in the market losing money."
"You might say, why don't they go out of business?"
The reason they don't go out of business is because they've already pay huge sunk costs.
It's not efficient to go out of business.
They've already invested a certain amount.
"It's not going to be efficient to go out of business, because then they'll give up the cost they've invested."
"So if you're a doctor, and you've spent all this money on med school, and you're not making money as a doctor in the first couple of years."
"If you quit and go do something else, you've just given up all the investment you made in med school."
"So if there's any prospect that eventually you'll make money, you might want to hang on and keep being a doctor."
So that's the difference between a fixed cost and a sunk cost.
"So I'm going to come back to that, but it's important to remember that distinction when we talk about competition."
"So let me stop there, and we'll come back on"
"Wednesday, I guess."
Have a good three-day weekend.
We'll come back on Wednesday and we'll talk about competition.
One of the things we of course are tremendously interested in is the whole idea of the Readymade.
We are familiar with the concept of junk sculpture.
"This is something that such artists as and even Picasso in earlier days more or less advanced, to pick up an object which was made for an entirely different use, possibly a discarded object, which because of its shape and its patination, its configuration, suggests another possibility."
"It may be a very satisfying texture, a very romantic kind of quality about the piece, in other words, it became a kind of chosen object but chosen for esthetic reasons."
In what respect does junk sculpture differ from the concept of the Readymade?
"Let's say for example, the Bottle Rack or the Bicycle Wheel?"
"This was of course the difficulty when it came to my mind but that was back in 1915, when I applied the word Readymade to these objects."
"In fact, I only made 13 of them in my life, in 40 years so it is not very much of an occupation."
"All those error terms have an h, so I'm going to collect all the h's at the end."
"The first error term is g prime of f of x, this term here, times the error of f at h."
"The next ones, plus the error of g, at this complicated quantity,"
"I was going to abbreviate hyphen, times f prime of x times h, I'm collecting all of these h's the end, plus the error term for g, at that complicated quantity, times the error for f at h, and all of that is times h."
Alright.
"Now, this is almost giving me the derivative of the composite function provided that I can control the size of this error term, right?"
"What I need to show now is that the limit as h approches 0 of this error term is really 0, and the error term, right, it's the part before th e times h, and it's g prime of f of x times the error term for f at h plus the error term for g times f prime of x, plus the error term for g times the error term for f at h."
"Now, why do I know that, that limit is equal to 0?"
"Well, I can do it in pieces, right?"
"It's the limit of the sum, so it's the sum of the limits. and I know that this first term is 0 because it's got an error f h term in it, and because f is differentiable, the error term goes to 0."
"I likewise know the same for this, alright?"
"This is, it also got an error f of h term in it."
The most mysterious term is this.
"But if you think a little bit more about it, the error of g at this hyphen thing, which I'm abbreviating this whole thing here, also goes to 0 as h goes to 0."
"And that's another thing to know that the limit as h goes to 0 of this quantity is 0 which is then enough to say that g of f of x plus h equals this quantity, actually implies that this is the derivative."
"So, here's what we've actually shown."
"Suppose that f is differentiable at a point a and g is differentiable at the point f of a, then the composite function, g composed with f, is differentiable at a, with the derivative of g of f at the point a, equal to the derivative of g at f of a times the derivative of f at a."
My name is Ahmad Mahmoud Ahmad
President of the Strike Committee in the Public Transport Authority in Egypt.
"I ask bus workers in London to demand their rights, whatever it might cost."
"In any strike, the negotiators must be an elected committee of strikers."
If you have an appointed committee it won't get the workers their rights.
If it is an appointed committee of salaried officials its job will be to stop the strike.
The goal of an unelected committee of of negotiators is to stop the action.
So I urge bus workers in London to elect a committee to negotiate with the government because an unelected committee will not negotiate in the name of the workers.
The strike must be led by those elected by all the strikers.
"Our negotiators in the Public Transport Authority in Egypt are elected, not appointed."
"If they were appointed they wouldn't get us our rights, and would stop the strike."
"When we are building for a strike, we try to convince our colleagues that our demands are just and fair, and that we should win our rights."
"And if negotiations don't work, we'll call a strike."
"Strikes are a legitimate right of every citizen, even in London."
Every citizen in the world has the right to strike.
The median here is five.
"Now, we'll add the numbers together and divide by the number of data points to get a mean of approximately five and three-tenths."
In this case both the median and the mean are good descriptors of the data.
"We could also find the mean, median,  and mode from tables of data."
"Here, a boy asked his five best friends how far they live from school, and they all gave their answers in blocks."
"One friend must live right across the street, but most friends live much further away."
"All of the distances got the same number of responses, and when every number could be the mode,  we say instead that there is no mode, and we use the word null."
The mode here is null.
"The median is easy to find with so few numbers, and it is seventeen."
When we add and divide to find the mean; we add them all up and get seventy. there are five responses so they have an average of fourteen.
"Once again, we have an outlier because the one  is so much less than any of the other data points."
"An outlier affects the mean, and here the mean of fourteen is less than the distance of four out of the five friends."
In this case the median is probably the best measure because it's closest to most of the responses.
"When an outlier is involved,  the median is often the best measure."
"In this lesson you have learned how to summarize the center of data with a single number by examining the mean, median, and mode."
This is a good time to pause and summarize what we've learned so far.
We've learned some theory and some practice.
"In theory, we've learned about patterns, which are grammars which describe languages, where a language is a set of strings."
"We've learned about interpreters over those languages, and about compilers, which can do the same thing only faster."
"In terms of practice, we've learned that regular expressions are useful for all sorts of things, and they're a concise language for getting work done."
"We've learned that interpreters, including compilers, can be valuable tools, and that they can be more expressive and more natural to describe a problem in terms of a native language that makes sense for the problem rather than in terms of Python code that doesn't necessarily make sense."
We learned functions are more composable than other things in Python.
"For example, in Python we have expressions, and we have statements."
They can only be composed by the Python programmer whereas functions can be composed dynamically.
We can take 2 functions and put them together.
We can take f and call g with that and then apply that to some x.
We can do that for any value of f and g.
We can pass those into a function and manipulate them and have different ones applying to x.
We can't do that with expressions and statements.
"We can do it with the values of expressions, but we can't do it with expressions themselves."
Functions provide a composability that we don't get elsewhere.
"Functions also provide control over time, so we can divide up the work that we want to do into do some now and do some later."
"""Let Googlebot decide."""
"The second parameter that I'd like to cover is the ""narrows"" parameter. ""narrows"" filters the content on the page by showing a subset of the total items."
So you probably see this on an e-commerce site.
"Where in the navigation, a user is able to select, if they only want to see items that are less than 25 dollars."
Or 25 dollars to 49.99. aAll of this is narrowing the content of the total items.
"Examples of the ""narrows"" parameter are ""size equals medium."" ""Less than equals 25."" Or"
"""Color equals blue."" If the ""narrows"" parameter shows less useful content."
"Shows content that's just a subset of the content from the more useful URL, which doesn't include the ""narrows"" parameter."
"Then you might be able to specify ""Crawl No URLs."" For example, a useful URL is ""category equals YouTube."" And the less useful URL is ""category equals YouTube and size equals medium."""
"Here, I might specify ""size"" as a ""narrows"" parameter."
"And then because it has less useful content, I can say ""crawl No URLs."" But before I specify ""Crawl No URLs"" it's good to verify a few things first."
"First, be sure that the ""narrows"" parameter won't also filter out useful pages that you'd like crawled and surfaced in search results."
"So if you have brand or category pages that you'd like to show to users, be sure that when you select ""Crawl"
"No URLs"" that those brand and category pages won't be affected."
"Second, verify that example"
URLs that might be displayed in Webmaster Tools are really URLs that provide non-useful content.
When compared to the parent URL.
"So again, you see content like ""Category equals"
"YouTube and size equals medium."" And you know that the ""size equals medium"" that narrows parameter just isn't' useful."
"If the behavior of ""Crawl No URLs"" just isn't optimal for your site because it affects too many important brand or category pages then perhaps let Googlebot decide."
"The next parameter is ""Specifies."" ""Specifies"" determines the content displayed on a page."
"For example, ""item id equals android t-shirt"" or ""sku equals 495."" The ""Specifies"" parameter is responsible for the actual content."
"So you'll likely select ""Crawl Every URL."" After"
"""specifies"" is ""translates."""
"Unless you want to exclude certain languages from being crawled and available in search results, like auto-generated translations."
"Unless that's the case, then it's likely you'll select ""Crawl Every URL."""
"As an aside, one best practice that I'd like to mention, and this is by no means a requirement, is to put your translated original content not in a URL parameter, but actually in a sub-folder or a sub-directory."
"The reason why is that in a sub-directory or sub-folder, it helps Google to better understand your site's structure."
And that this applies to translated or regional content.
"The last parameter is ""Paginates."" ""Paginates"" displays one component page of a multi-page sequence."
"Examples are ""page equals three."""
"""Viewitems equals ten through 30."" Or ""start-index is 20."" With paginates, because you want us to crawl every page to reach all of your items, it's nearly always ""Crawl Every URL."""
"We shipped Firefox 1 by February or March, there was a security issue that we didn't actually know how to fix right away."
Like a lot of times when a security issue is reported it turns out that figuring out the problem is the hard part and fixing it is the easier part.
"But this was one, it was a class of vulnerability that someone, somewhere, is this the guy in Japan?"
I think someone had figured out a new way of attacking products.
"So we had this immense focus, attention and user base growing and this phenomenally difficult product to try and deal with it, really giant."
"So, someday if you see Johnny Stenback and you wanna know what immense pressure is really like ask him about that period, the one that... 0.5 and 1.0.6..."
So success has its own issues.
That was one of things that we learned.
"That it is phenomenal to be at the centre and so we experienced that with Mozilla today, that success is phenomenal but it brings its own stresses and tensions, and if you're not careful and you just focus on the stress, it's easy to forget that is the sign of success."
"The sign of success in that era was that we had this product,"
like it was critical to fix this problem right away.
And you don't know how to do it.
"Everybody's looking at you, you really have to be more than you thought you could be."
"It's immensely stressful, that's success."
"So if you find yourself in those settings today, of course try to step back, take a deep breath, be healthy, get some exercise, do all of those things but remember that that level of stress and tension reflects the importance that we have, how critical we are to people's lives and is a measure of success."
"Not the best measure, there's more fun measures but when you're in the middle of those settings it is important to remember that if we didn't matter then that stress isn't gonna be the same."
Yes.
[Question]
Sure.
When we started as a foundation there was never any question about that.
"AOL knew that would be the case, all of us who wanted to work for it knew it would be the case."
"So we set it up that way, and then, as in December of 2004, became clear that we were gonna get significant amounts of money."
"I think December was probably a 3 million dollar check, as I remember, something like that."
So we had (...) that much in a year and suddenly we had it in a month.
"I know you're given a protocol, in other words you're given kind of a script for each week."
Each week there's a certain script you sort of work through.
But why don't we ask a current Speaking Partner how that works.
Well President Clark is exactly right.
"It's really wonderful, you and your Speaking Partner will both go online and you'll pull up the same script from which"
largely he or she leads you in the discussion.
"And they understand that's their responsibility and so you sort of follow along, it's like being the junior companion."
It's wonderful and it's a very well structured curriculum.
Everything has an explanation as  to why it is so.
"""Who is wise?He who learns from every person"""
There is much guidance in Pirkei Avot.
"A student in Be'er Sheva once told me that when he started studying psychology he suddenly discovered that the nicest phrases he ever heard in his life and  didn't know where they originated,they were all from Pirkei Avot."
So a person studies Pirkei Avot then psychology.He then studies the Chulin Tractate which  is all about anatomy.
"He becomes proficient in anatomy, in all the internal organs and systems that are all related to animals and the laws of slaughtering and Kashrut.So he studies the  internal systems of the anatomy."
When he studies the Baba Kama Baba Metzia and Baba Batra tractates
It's as though he has studied law.All the complex monetary laws are there and they sharpen the mind in a wonderful way.
Did you now that the South Korean TV arrived at the Ponovich Yeshiva in Israel in order to discover the secret of the Gemara that makes
Jews so smart and worthy of Nobel prizes.
"These tractates,Baba Metzia,Baba Kama Baba Batra of monetary laws sharpen the mind and logic.A person who  studies tractates of Orla,Kilaim studies the world of vegetation and botany.There's a lot in there about the world of vegetation and so on."
In the laws of Shabbat there are many issues concerning medicine.
"There are matters of the world in every aspect,as it says"
"""Turn it and turn it and you'll find  everything within it"""
"So let us now see a Mishnah  from Pirkei Avot that is connected to our topic,the world of vegetation."
"The Mishna is in Chapter 3,Mishna 17. ""whosever's wisdom is more than his actions,what does he resemble?"
"To a tree who's branches are many and its roots are few. and the wind comes,uproots it and turns it over."
"As it says,""For he shall be like a  tamarisk in the desert and shall not see when good comes but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, a salt land  and not inhabited"""
"""But he whose deeds are more than his wisdom resembles a tree whose branches are few but his roots are many and even when all the winds in the world blow on him they can not move him from his place.As it says"
"""And it is like a tree planted on water and that spreads out its roots by the river and shall not see when heat comes but its foliage shall be luxuriant and shall not be anxious in the year  of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit."""
"Here,the Mishnah in Pirkei Avot is teaching us a great lesson with  a great principle for life."
"Oftentimes,a person gives up on  the performance of deeds."
"He says,it doesn't matter what  I do,as long as I'm learning,as"
"long as I'm smart.He sits and learns Torah,becomes wise."
"But practically,he doesn't strengthen himself with actual Mitzvot."
"Let us read the words of the  Tiferet Israel and how he explains this Mishnah,but we will first preface what the Mishnah says in a general way.The Mishnah says that a person whose wisdom is greater than his actions,meaning he knows a lot but barely fulfills."
"What is this like?It's like a tree with many branches,which is the wisdom but his actions,which are the roots are few."
What happens to a tree that's  full of branches but has few roots?
When a strong wind comes what happens?
"It uproots it and turns it upside down.Which means that now,the branches damage him even more!"
Because why did he fall?
"Because he has many branches and few roots.But if it is the opposite where he has few branches but many roots,he is strong and stable."
With Western up 6 to 2 after Grandview converted a penalty.
Chrissy Campbell put the finishing touches on the offensive out-burst.
Campbell touched away and that will be 7 to 2 right at the death.
With the win Western moved to 5 and 2 on the year.
The 7 goal out-burst was the most scored in a single match since 2009 when Western scored 7 times against the same Grand View squad.
Welcome.
"This is the first, of three lessons, in week one, in the fundamentals of financial, personal financial planning course."
"Have you ever found yourself in a new city, looking for a particular store or restaurant, but you're not sure how to get there?"
"Then, suddenly you come across a large map just like the one shown here."
Isn't it comforting to see that big you are here symbol. so you know where you are and where you need to go?
"Well, in this first lesson, I'm going to show you how to build your financial you are here starting point."
"So, where are you today?"
What shape are your finances in.
"In order to answer this, you need to examine three parts of you financial picture."
"Your network statement, your cash flow and your emergency funds."
"In this lesson, I'll describe each of these components and give you a toll to help you determine your networks."
"By carefully analyzing these aspects for your finances, you'll get a good sense of your current financial health."
"First, a net worth statement or personal balance sheet is simply a summary of your assets and liabilities as of a given date."
It's just a snapshot.
"Simply put, it involves adding up what you own and subtracting out what you owe."
"Some examples of assets are things like your checking account, savings, certificate of deposit or CD, money market accounts, the cash value of a life insurance policy, and your real estate."
"Other assets are like investments, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, retirement accounts, and pension funds."
"Your assets also include any personal property such as your cars, recreational vehicles, jewelry and anything else in your home that you think is valuable enough to list."
"Now, on to the other half of the equation, what do you owe?"
"Some examples of liabilities, are student loans credit card debt, your mortgage, car loans, bank loans, personal debt to friends or family, business loans that you personally owe, or even back taxes you might owe, the IRS."
"It's really debt that you owe to anyone, whether you have a printed statement or not."
This i s how you arrive at your net worth.
"After you've calculated your net worth using a worksheet, you will know whether you have a positive or a negative net worth."
Take a look at the definition shown here.
"Without even doing the math, you may already have a hunch where you fall at this point."
Are you in the red or are you in the black?
"Either way, this is essential information, so you have, so you have to begin to grasp all the elements of sound financial planning."
Hello once again.
This is Roger Coke Barr for the Bioelectricity course.
"We're in Week five, Segment three."
"In the past segment, we were talking about how, when you lay track."
"You have to be conscious of the fact that each, each place on the ground connects with its neighbors."
You have to be conscious of whether you're going uphill or downhill.
You have to be conscious of whether you're going across a stream or up a mountain.
It's similar in bioelectricity when you begin to talk about currents.
"When you talk about currents, you have to think about what kind of tissue am I in."
"What are these, what is the physical and physiological structure because I'd like to know how currents are moving from one place to another."
"Before getting into the details of analyzing a particular case, let's look at some alternatives."
Just to have some idea of what is what are different kinds of structures that have to be considered as one considers a range of different kinds of tissue.
"So, the simplest structure is that of a uniform cylindrical fiber."
"This diagrammatically, we just do it like this."
"One simple centrical fiber in a tissue structure sense, very simple."
Although what happens within it can be rather complicated.
"As an alternative, think of a bundle of cylindrical fibers."
"So, if I draw a cross section."
"Here's may be the outer sheath of the bundle, but within it, there may be lots of fibers."
"So the whole space is filled up with many, many individual fibers within the sheet."
"To our first approximation, all these fibers inside, act as if they were independent, individual fibers."
"But they, they're performance may be affected by the fact that there are others nearby."
"If for no reason other than the, the adjacent fibers are using up space, and making it harder for the extra sailor current to flow."
"Of course, there's still other structures."
Maybe one fiber comes along and it branches.
"And maybe in the process of branching, the diameter of the fiber changes."
"So, one then must take into account both the fact that towards the end, there are two rather than one."
"But then, also the fact that the diameter over here is small and the diameter over here is big."
All those things will affect how current flows from one place to another.
"And then, for the heart and for the brain especially, but in many other particular cases, you have large numbers of small cells, and they're all clustered together in a very tight packing."
"These may be 2D clusters, two-dimensional sheets of cells as is true, more or less in the cardiac atrium or this may be a big three-dimensional mass of cells, where rather than trying to draw a cell by cell,"
"I'll just make a line, but where there's an entire volume of space that's filled up with small cells."
"So what happens is that when the query shift shifted from, basically, mortgages, to mortgage help, to mortgage refinance help, to lawyers to help me prevent my house from being foreclosed."
"I don't know if that's a good story, or bad, but it's all obvious, it's all playing out in real time."
Another way of saying it is the things that you see on television are really true.
"That's another way to say it, because we see it."
[laughs] So the areas that have been most hit on the on line world are the same as the ones that you'd imagine in the off
"line world--things like travel, and automobiles, and financials, and so forth."
"And consumers are smart, so they use the Internet to, now, then,"
look for bargains in that space.
"So they do, in fact, look for discount trips if they're going to travel, although that volume is off, and so forth."
"We haven't seen anything unusual, and what's interesting about it is that, from our perspective, aside from running the business much more tightly; in other words, trying to actual make profits for a change in some of these businesses, we haven't fundamentally changed our strategic view, which is that the Internet is a part of everybody's life and that innovation in terms of new products will really enable people to do some amazing things."
"We've taken a position, for example, that the person should really be the search."
"It should really not just be a search that you do, but really about your viewpoint or history and, again, with your permission, we can store that kind of information. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
You mentioned you're trying to make profits from businesses that hadn't been profitable before.
"You have a new CFO; it seems like right guy, right time. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
Very much so. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
If you could provide us any thoughts on the kind of changes he's been able to make to obvious observations on the financials; opex per employee went down 6% last quarter.
"It's still high, relative to a lot of other companies. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
"But our profitability is, too. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
Your profitability is still high.
So there.
Touche.
"And capex per, as a percent of revenue, was down dramatically."
How should we--and free cash flow was up 70% during your last quarter. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, for instance, we like cash--we like to generate cash."
"A good metric in any situation is if you can grow your profits at an absolute basis, and if you can generate pretty good free cash flow, you're going to get through this."
So we've taken that position internally.
"Patrick is--Patrick is our CFO--is particularly at doing business reviews, and so we've been going through systematically, business after business."
"And it won't surprise long term followers of Google that in our, sort of, hyper growth period, we did not have the necessary systems in place-- budgeting and the sort of estimation."
We're putting those in place today.
"And, in fact, they are in place."
"So, Google management spends most of its time doing business reviews today."
Looking at new products--how will this new product really change user behavior?
It ran in linear time.
It gave us shortest paths.
It gave us connected components.
Why do we need to do anything else?
"Well, it turns out depth first search has its own impressive catalog of applications, some of which you cannot get using breadth first search."
"So, what I'm gonna show you in this video is about computing the topological ordering of a directed graph."
Both of the applications we're gonna discuss are in directed graphs.
The simple one is topological ordering.
This just means you sequence nodes of the directed acyclic graph so that all the arcs go forward.
So you might be wondering you know why bother with another graph search strategy.
After all we have breadth-first search which seems pretty awesome right?
It runs in linear time.
It's guaranteed to find everything you might wanna find.
It computes shortest paths.
It computes connected components if you imbed it in a for loop.
Kinda seems like what else would you want?
"Well, it turns out depth-first search is gonna have its own impressive catalog of applications which you can't necessarily replicate with breadth-first search."
And I'm gonna focus on applications in directed graphs.
So there's gonna be a simple one that we discuss in this video.
And then there's gonna be a more complicated one that has a separate video devoted to it.
"So in this video, we're gonna be discussing computing topological orderings of directed acyclic graphs."
"That is, directed graphs that have no directed cycle."
The more complicated application is computing strongly connected components in directed graphs.
The run time will be essentially the same as it was for breadth-first search and the best we could hope for which is linear time.
"And again, we're not assuming that there's necessarily that many edges."
There may be much fewer edges than vertices.
"So, linear time in these connectivity applications means O of M plus N. So let's now talk about the actual code of depth-first search."
There's a couple ways to do it.
One way to do it is to just make some minor modifications to the code for breadth-first search.
"The primary difference being instead of using a queue at its first in, first out behavior, you swap in a stack where it's last in, first out behavior."
"Again, if you don't know what a stack is you should read about that in the programming textbook or on the web."
It's something that supports constant-time insertions to the front and constant time deletions from the front unlike a queue which is meant to support constant-time deletions to the back.
We just find those employees who are among the X employees and we sum up their salaries.
"So, let's take a look at the recursive definition here and again, it's taking the usual form of a base query, union and recursive query... and here's what we do."
"Well, obviously the manager of project X is one of the IDs involved in project"
"X. So here we find in the project, the project name text and we take the manager of that project and we put that person's ID into Xemps."
That's the first ID that's going to go in there.
That's going to seed the recursion.
That's again the base query.
Then we add in our recursive step any employee who is managed by anybody who's in the X employees.
"So, we'll take our manager relationship, our X employees relationship and if the employee's manager is an"
"X, then that employee is also involved in X. So we seed the recursion with the manager of project X and then we just recursively go down the tree adding all of the employees that are underneath one by one."
We don't have to know the depth of the tree because the recursion will continue until nobody else is added.
I guess I should have mentioned that earlier in my earlier examples.
"Again the recursion sort of adds a data over and over again until there's nothing new to add, and that's when it terminates."
So let's go ahead and run the query.
"Anti-climatic again, but we get the same answer 400 as the salary cost of Project"
X. Now we use the same form of query to find the total salary cost of two projects Y and Z.
And that will also demonstrate having two relations that are defined in the width recursive command.
"So I have added project Y and Z to our project table, and they're both managed by employees who are already in the database, so they're a little lower down the hierarchy."
We should expect those projects have lower total cost.
"That's for project X, whose manager was at the root of our hierarchy."
"So here's our query, it's a big one; we're going to define YM and ZM exactly as we defined X amps in the previous example."
"So Y amps is a table of a recursively defined relation, temporary, that's gonna contain a list of IDs of the people, the employees that are involved in Project Y. So we are going to put the manager of"
"Project Y as our base query, and then we're going to add to it in the recursion all of the employees who are managed by someone who's in the YMs."
And ZM's exactly the same.
We start the manager of project
"Z, and then we add to it, all of the people are managed transitively down the tree by someone who's in the ZM's relation."
And then our final query down here for the statement is a union of two queries.
The first one gets the total salary for Y and it labels it as Y total.
So it takes all the Ids that are in the Y table and from the employee table get their salaries and sums them up.
And similarly the Z total.
"So now we'll run this query, it will be slightly less is anti-climactic."
We do have now two tuples in our result.
Returning to an idea I mentioned a couple of slides ago.
Let's say there is an assignment in a basic block.
Some registered W is assigned some value that's computed on the right hand side.
"Let's say that W, the registered name is not used anywhere else in the program."
"It doesn't appear anywhere, not only in this basic block but in any other part of the procedure in which this statement appears."
"Well then, the statement is dead and can be just deleted from the program And dead here means it does not contribute to the programs result."
"Since the value that we write into W is never referenced anywhere, W is never used, doing the computation, of"
"W in the first place was a waste of time, so we can just delete that computation."
Here's a simple example.
"Let's assume that the register a is not used any place else, in the program."
"And, the first thing we have to do, so here's our initial piece of code."
The first thing we do is we put it in single assignment form.
"And so I've renamed here, this register x, to be, register b."
"Okay, and once we do that, let me do that, so we'll say that B=Z+Y and A=B, and then we propagate this forward."
"Alright, so we've now replaced this use of A by B, so this takes us to this state where we have this piece of code."
Now we can see that we have an assignment to A. A is not used in the subsequent instruction.
"We already said that A is not used anywhere outside of the basic block, and so the assignment a=b can be deleted, and we wind up with this shorter basic block."
Now each local optimization actually does very little by itself.
"And some of these optim izations, some of these transformations that are presented actually don't make the program run faster at all."
They don't make it run slower either but by themselves they don't actually make any improvement to the program.
"But, Typically, the optimizations will interact."
So performing one optimization will enable another.
"And we saw this in the little example that I did, a few slides ago."
So the way to think about an optimizing compiler is that it has a big bag of tricks.
It has a lot of.
"Individual program transformations that it knows And what it is going to do when faced with a program's optimize, it's going to rummage around in its bag looking for an optimization, that applies to some part of the code."
"If it finds one, it will do the optimization, it will do the transformation and then it will repeat."
"It'll go back and look at the program again, and see if there's another optimization that reapplies."
Then it will just keep doing this until it reaches a point where none of the optimization's it knows about can be applied to the programming.
"Next, we'll take a look at a bigger example and try applying some of the optimizations that we've discussed, to it, and see how far we get."
"And of course this example has been constructed to illustrate, many of the optimizations that we discussed."
"So, the first thing we can do."
It's just that m happens residually.
"So, notice that once we have x star of p, the amount of the composite good that he consumes is just given by the budget constraint, basically by W minus p x star of p, is automatically followed from the nature of the problem."
"Now, what about the solution to the utility maximization problem?"
"So, recall that the problem looks like maximize over x greater or equal than zero, B(x) - xp."
"Now, we go also that we half assume that B prime is greater than zero, and B double prime is less than zero."
"Given the linearity of the cost function, this implies that the problem satisfies the concavity, concavity conditions are satisfied."
"And that, and in that case, we know a lot from unit one about the properties of the solution, and that's what I am going to do now is characterize them."
"In particular, we have to worry about three cases that I am going to draw for you."
"Case one is the most interesting one in some sense, which is that interior solution."
And this is a solution in particular where the demand at that price is equal or less than zero.
"Now, how do the first order conditions for this case, in general the, the, the characterization of the solution look?"
"So, we can do this first order condition maps or graphs that we were doing before."
"And, it's going to case, it's going to be a case that look like follows."
"We have a p, this is the x."
"A constant, what we were referring to before in the math section as a constant marginal cost."
We're going to have a marginal benefit function that somehow crosses from above.
"So, B prime of zero is above B and it eventually crosses."
And we're going to have that the optimal
"level to, of the man is this given by the cross, xP, star of p."
"So, in particular, xP star of p is given by the solution to B prime of x equals p."
That is the equation that determines into your solution.
"Now, there is a second case that we also look at length in Unit one, which is a corner solution with x star of p equals zero."
"I mean, if you remember that's a case of looks like this."
"We have the marginal, the price for example here which is the marginal cost."
"The marginal benefit function, B prime, crosses at zero below."
"So, in that particular case, it never paid off to take out the first unit and the optimal solution is to set equals to zero."
"Now, unfortunately, since there is nothing in the model that guarantees that the crossing conditions are satisfied, we need to worry about a third case that look like this. x star of p is equal to infinity."
"In some sense, the solution doesn't exist."
And that's a case that looks like this.
"You have x, you have p, and you have a marginal benefit function above but that somehow keeps going down but never crosses."
"It never crosses, okay?"
"So, in this particular case, it keeps, it is profitable, in terms of inclusion experidentry to keep doing the marginal, buying more and more of x on the margin all the way to infinity."
"According to physicists, the level-one parallel universe... is just an extension of our own universe."
"Now, that's the kind of universe... which is really sort of part of our space... of our giant space... but it's so far away that we can't see it."
The level-one parallel universe is based on the idea... that the universe is infinite in size.
"If true, just by the sheer mathematical odds... there must be out there in endless space... an exact copy of the solar system, the Earth... and all the people on it."
If you're planning a trip... the closest level-one parallel universe... is really incredibly far away.
"Crudely speaking, you have to go googolplex yards... where a googol is one with a hundred zeroes after it... and a googolplex is one with a googol zeroes."
"So it's an awfully long way, farther than we can see."
Those universes are so far away that light hasn't reached us.
But is our universe really infinite?
A new theory called cosmic inflation suggests that it is.
"We think that it was born in a very, very small state... and then there was a kind of a weird energy... that pushed it apart by a tremendous amount."
It just went whoosh.
Inflation accounts for how our universe... suddenly and massively grew after its inception.
"The best theory we have right now for what made space so big- the theory of inflation- says, in fact, that space isn't just big or huge... that it's really infinite."
"It goes on forever... which means that there aren't just one, two, three... but infinitely many other regions of space... just as big as our universe."
Even the universe that we know is mind-blowingly big.
"When we fly around in intergalactic space like this... every little blob you see here can contain a galaxy... which, in turn, might contain hundreds of billions of stars... with solar systems around them and so on."
So there's just this enormous number of other spaces out there... that we can't see.
And there is more.
We actually think that there's a gigantic number... perhaps even an infinite number of level-one universes.
This radical idea is leading... to a completely new definition of the cosmos.
"We used to say universe, ""uni"" meaning one- a one-world theory."
"Everything there is, everything we can see is the universe."
"Now, we have a multiverse idea where there are unseen worlds- worlds that we cannot see, worlds that we cannot touch."
"If this wild theory is correct, the consequences are sensational."
Within this infinite universe... you might have other copies of the solar system... of planet Earth.
And this is the real shocker.
Then there's a copy of me and you... and everyone else out there somewhere.
And that's not all.
There are an infinite number of other universes and other Earths... and infinite copies of each one of us.
"If true, then every possible outcome for every life has to happen."
"In some universes, in what some now call the multiverse... one leads exactly the same life... but in others, things can be slightly different."
Event loops are the heart of the web browser.
Everything works in the web browser based on an event loop.
An event
"loop is driven off of an event queue which contains callback functions, and those callback functions get put onto the queue by the timer using setTimeOut or setlnterval or by UI events."
"So clicks and mouse overs and all that stuff get translated in and put into the queue — and network activity, so when a script gets loaded or a loading is complete, that information will be put onto the event queue."
Then the event queue takes turns.
"In each turn it takes one callback off of the event queue, runs it to completion, and then does the next one."
"It's a really simple loop, but it's a really powerful loop."
"The prime directive in an event driven system is never block, so you can't wait for IO, and you can't wait for network activity, you just run and run and when you can't run anymore you return."
"You can set up other things to run in the future, but you never block, you never wait, and you have to finish fast."
If you can do those three things you can run really well in event loop.
"That's how the browser runs, and the browser runs really well."
"The event loop is one of the best parts of the browser, but because it's a part of the browser we didn't get it completely right."
There are a couple of things in the browser
"API which block, and because they block you really shouldn't use them."
"Alert and its sisters are OK to use for debugging, but you should never put them in production code because they will block the main browser thread."
"Also, XML HTTP request has two modes: a synchronous mode and an asynchronous mode."
"The synchronous mode blocks, and because it blocks you should never use that."
"Fortunately, there is an asynchronous mode which does the right thing: it makes the request and then you can have it call back engaged when it finishes."
"In the browser, when UI events are generated it's possible to have multiple event handlers run as a result of bubbling."
"But in reality there's only one function that runs, and it's something that's similar to this where it'll be a little bit more complicated."
"But it will end up looping through the DOM, looking for the event handler that says OK, we're done processing this, and once it's finished then that's the end of the term."
So that's how we do event delegation in JavaScript.
Does anybody know who this lady is?
Show of hands -- who knows who this is?
Everybody should know who this is.
This is a really important lady.
This is Grace Murray Hopper.
"She was the first woman to get a PhD in Mathematics at Yale, then went on to teach Mathematics at Vassar."
"When the US entered World War Il, her husband signed up and joined the military, as did her brother and her cousins, and she decided that she would too."
So at the age of 36 she resigned her tenure position at Vassar and joined the Navy.
"Being a mathematician, she thought she'd probably be assigned to do cryptography or some other kind of code breaking business."
MP3s via Amazon or I-Tunes via Apple--with some of your most used videos.
How do you see both the artists using that venue over the next one to two years as they're dealing with their contracts with the industry?
"And how do you see the monetization for the artists and for You Tube play out, just as one example."
You may want to focus on another way that
You Tube is increasingly going to be monetized. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:
"Well, You Tube is--You Tube is slowly getting the monetization right."
It's taken us much longer than we had hoped to get it right.
I've always been concerned that the aggregate monetization of on line does not replace the lost revenue for off line.
That's the fundamental conundrum of music industry.
"It's a potential conundrum for the video and movie industries, and everybody is very worried about this, so we're working hard on that."
The music industry as a whole has the following problem.
"In the 1980s, they believe--their self view--is that they helped create MTV, which is a very successful property, obviously, by giving them licenses to music videos ""too cheaply,"" according to their view."
"And so there's an ongoing battle, business discussion, whatever term you want to do, about how do you compensate the music industry for the use of the music in things which are promotional?"
I don't know how that's going to resolve itself.
"Apple, and I think you know, as you know, I'm on the Board of Apple-- successfully has worked that out with I-Tunes, after a lot of arguing."
And I think I-Tunes is a very positive example of this.
We need an analogous example of the way music videos will work on the Internet.
You Tube is very successful with music videos.
"It's also very successful with sports, comedy, and other sort of humor."
And we are working hard on longer form content and HD content.
"Because You Tube has so many viewers--literally this huge audience-- if we can get even small amounts of profit because of the scale, add the big numbers really quickly. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:"
"Some of the obstacles in the way with regards to getting more content on You Tube have been the Viacoms of the world, and then the major media companies. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
That would be a one billion dollar lawsuit. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;MARY:
That would be a one billion dollar lawsuit.
"Anyway, I'm not going to go down that path."
"But if we look at the financial results for those media companies in the fourth quarter, using News Corp as an example, they're local TV review was down 30% plus."
"They may--They, meaning--and I mentioned this earlier today, but the trajectory that the local TV and broadcast TV is on is sort of similar."
"It's just that you look at a chart, to where newspapers were a year ago, is it possible that that group of players who have been stand-off to you and not wanting to participate, may change their view, simply given that their economic situation is different than it was before. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ERlC SCHMlDT:"
I would hope so.
"And, you know, they see the same numbers that we do, and we understand their problem."
And we are critically dependent on the creation of this high quality content.
There's only so much user-generated video that everybody is going to want.
"This is the thing that Google showed us with Google Gears, which was brilliant."
"You can take another process, put your program in it, and it will send an event back to your event loop when it's finished."
That's brilliant.
We can even take that further.
There's no reason why that process needs to be on the same machine.
It could be on another machine.
It could be anywhere in the world.
It could be closer to the data rather than to us if that turns out to be the most effective place to put it.
"Another way people think about doing this stuff is the remote procedure call, which combines two great ideas, functions and networking, producing a really bad idea."
[laughter]
"Like READ, it attempts to isolate programs from time."
"There was a long time when that was thought to be a good thing, but when you're doing highly interactive programs — especially programs that deal with people — it turns out to be a really bad thing, because the program blacks out."
"It experiences lost time, and it's not aware that it blacks out."
"Reading the program, it is by design difficult to see where the time is lost, because remote procedure call is a deception."
"It's intended to disguise the fact that you're going across the network by making everything appear to be nice, local, fast calls."
"All of this can result in a terrible experience for the user, because lost time turns into annoying delays, and people don't like that."
It's rude and it's disrespectful.
It's not a good way to treat people.
"What we need to do instead is to give people the best feedback possible, and latency compensation is an important technique in doing that."
"At a minimum, we need to immediately acknowledge the user's input."
"The user clicked or entered something, and we need to let them know right away that we got it, we know what you're doing, and we're on the case."
We don't want to lock up the interaction while we're waiting for the server's response.
We want to keep everything dynamic.
In some applications we can actually do better than that.
"If we can predict what the server's response is going to be, we can go ahead and put that on the screen."
"If it turns out that we predicted wrong then when the server tells us so we can then correct it, but for a lot of applications that can make an extremely nice experience for the user."
Let's talk about security.
Security is a really important thing.
"We saw when you're trying to write applications using threads that security really isn't attainable because you don't have consistency, and without consistency you can't reason about the correctness of your program."
Correctness is virtually impossible; at least it is for me in that environment.
We do better in an event driven system than in a threaded system.
"But just avoiding threads doesn't guarantee that you're going to be secure, either."
"Do people in their 40s and 50s, or my age, and I'm a grandparent at this age, do we tend to underestimate the passions and the almost affinity that young people, now coming of age with all this technology around them, have for using that technology and the expectation that they have for it?"
Sal:
"Yeah, it surprised me."
"I wouldn't have thought, when I started this up, I wouldn't have thought, that when I made videos on sine and cosine and l'Hopital's rule that they would become this 'main stream' thing but clearly there's this hunger for it."
"And the surprising thing is that it isn't just the younger generation we have 30 year olds, 40 year olds, 50 year olds..."
I got a letter from a grandmother that said it was her life dream to learn calculus - who knew?
"And she started working on it, so it is really across generations."
Tom:
Do you compliment what you do online with conventional text books or math books or offer references?
Sal:
"Well, it is an interesting..."
I think that there will always be a role for books.
"But textbooks right now do two things: the text tries to teach you something, it is sometimes hard to read."
And then the exercise try to give you practice.
"We think that on-demand video is often better than the text that you see in a lot of text books and that immediate feedback, self-paced learning with data and analytics and you get the steps of every problem, and it is kind of like a video game."
That that's better than every other answer in the back of the book.
So it will be interesting to see what happens to the textbook world.
Tom:
"What did you learn, if anything, at this point?"
"And I know it is empirical of it probably.. about whether some of us are hard-wired to do math and others of us, like me, are hard-wired to do other things."
I mean people ask me how I got to be a journalist and I say:
"""Algebra 2""."
(laughter)
Sal:
That's pretty good.
"No, the amazing thing that we've started seeing in these pilots in these classrooms is when you let every kid work at their own pace, right when you start off, you do see what we traditionally see: some of the kids race ahead and those are the kids that we all think will be nuclear physicists and whatever else."
"And some of the kids take a little bit longer on one concept to another and in a traditional model, you'd say: those kids are meant to be scientists or engineers."
These kids .. maybe they'll become journalists - which isn't so bad.
"But what we've seen is that if you let them work at their own pace, some of those kids who are spending a little extra time on negative numbers or exponents."
You give them that extra time and as soon at they get that some of them just race ahead.
"And so what we're seeing in our data in the classrooms is when we are not grouping kids based on early assessment, that every week there is a new leader."
"And some of the kids that two or three weeks ago you'd have said were slow or below average a week or two or a month later, they're the best kid in the class."
What was reduced?
"The oxygen was reduced by the hydrogen, and if you actually add these two reactions up, if you make this the left hand side of your equation and you make this your right hand sade of the equation, you can say"
"""Ok"" Let's remove the electrons from both sides and you'll end up with your original reaction."
"What was, and just to make sure our terminology is right, what's our oxidizing agent?"
"It's the thing that did the oxidizing, it's the oxygen."
What's the reducing agent?
It's the hydrogen.
Ket's do one more.
So here
"I have iron, plus some Hydrochloric acid, let's say this is in an aqueous solution, and you end up with iron (Il) chloride plus some hydrogen."
"So let's do some oxidation numbers, and I'll do it fast this time. iron is just by itself it's got a zero oxidation state."
"Hydrogen with chloride, chlorine's a halogen. haloge, these guys love to take electrons-they love to take one electron, they typically have a minus one oxidation state, so the chlorine is going to have minus one, the hydrogen is going to be plus one."
"Add them together you get to a neutral compound, fair enough. now you go on this side, what is chlorine's oxidation state?"
Well once again it always likes to take one electron.
"So this is minus one, but I have two chlorines here, this is a neutral compound so the iron oxidation state must be plus two."
Plus two.
What about the hydrogen?
"Well now it is jus in its elemental form, so it's going to be neutral and have a zero oxidation state."
So what was oxidized?
"Our iron, our iron went from neutral to being, to having two electrons taken away from it which gave it a positive charge, so plus two electrons got taken away, so this was oxidized."
This is oxidized.
What about the hydrogen?
"The hydrogen went from two hydrogens with a plus one oxidation state and essentially they went to two hydrogens with a neutral state, so two electrons must have been added to the hydrogens. two electrons were added, their charge was reduced, so they were reduced."
And what were they reduced by?
They were reduced by the iron.
What was the iron oxidized by?
It was oxidized by the hydrogen.
"What about the chlorine, the chlorine has a minus one oxidation number here, it has a minus one oxidation number here, it was neutral relative to the redox reaction, anyway I think you get the point now, and you can do this with a bunch of reactions, but this will give you a little more insight of actually whats going on and who's gaining and who's losing electrons and in the future it will also help us think about alot of the structures of molecules."
"Anyway, see you in the next video."
"It feels like a perfect night,"
"To dress up like hipsters,"
And make fun of our exes.
"Perhaps somebody in the group is the legitimate leader, who's been appointed to be the head of that group."
And it's important that they run the meeting and not somebody else take it over.
So power use.
"Is there some power, inappropriate use of power, try to use power for personal use even."
And then we get into fairness.
We don't want to discriminate.
We don't want to stereotype people.
We want to make sure everybody has a fair chance for whatever opportunities are there that the decisions we make are fair to everyone in the group as well.
They won't dump all the work on one person.
"There are rules about politeness and yelling or insulting, as well as rules about listening that we don't interrupt."
"These are all important parts of just being social, being courteous and polite, and that's important in a team just as much as it is in relationships."
And what we're going to do next is we're going to go to the subject of status.
"Now, status is a very difficult to understand variable because it's very closely related to power."
"In fact, just understanding the difference between power and status, sometimes it's sort of tough to draw that line."
You'll be probably doing an exercise or a paper just on the subject of status and power in this course.
So be ready to understand what these are and be ready to define them as you do your assignments or take your exam.
Let's talk about status.
There are actually two types of status.
"Let me define it first, so before we actually look at the types of status."
What status is is it's simply how much value or importance we put on someone in our eyes.
"Like somebody is a celebrity, somebody is, maybe there is somebody we all look up to because maybe it's the mayor of our town that's in this group, so they have high status."
"Or maybe the minister is in our group, so that person has higher status in our eyes."
"So, maybe we are going to listen more to this person, maybe not."
But status is how important we all seem to be in the eyes of the community and others.
And we're going to talk about two types of status.
The first type of status is what we call ascribed status.
"Now, ascribed status is based on a lot of factors about ourselves or mostly socioeconomic and demographic."
"You know like maybe it's our income level, maybe it's the job we do or career, maybe we're teachers or lawyers, or maybe we're managers, or maybe we're athletes or have other jobs where there is a lot of status attached to that career."
Gender also is a factor that can affect status.
Sometimes if we have too many men or too many women one gender could actually not be respected as much or given as much status depending on our view.
Physical attractiveness can affect status.
Maybe some people are handsome and tall.
I don't know why we call it that but we call it that.
"And eh, we go from one CPU that does one thing at a time, maybe jumping between threads, to multiple cores where maybe each thread can be on each core or maybe each core is still jumping between threads."
"Ehm, the other two things that you should really know, and let me go back to them, are Moore's Law, that the number of transistors on a chip double every eighteen months and that's a prediction, it's not a fact, and Amdahl's Law, which is a fact that there's a limit to how fast that we can make a program by parallelizing it."
"Eh, thank you guys."
Let's look at shortest tour but -how about we look at a bit more practical version of the shortest tour problem.
"So let's say first the shortest tour problem, instead of using 1 van which seems a little silly-- you'll realize, ""Hey, let's just use a lot of vans,"" let's say we'll use n vans in order to deliver the mail."
"Now, if all vans start at the same time, well then how does this end up changing the behavior of the problem and the complexity of the problem."
"Well, let's take a look at two different questions."
"First, let's ask how much time until all the mails delivered and all vans return to the base in the n vans scenario and the 1 van scenario."
"Will the n vans take less time, less than or equal to the same amount of time, greater than equal to the same amount of time, or always greater than the time that 1 van will take."
"And similarly, for the sum of all individual times taken by the vans."
"Now, what I mean by that is--if let's say each van takes 8 hours to deliver the mail and then return back to base, then the total amount of time would be 8 hours times n where n is the number of vans."
"And is this total amount of time always going to be less than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, or always greater than the amount of time taken by a single van to do the same thing?"
Please check whichever is most appropriate for both questions.
Odysseus has made his reunion with his son.
"Made a connection with the swine herd, in Eumaeus' hut."
"And now he's ready to, to start, reconnoitering."
Moving his way into the next step which is going to be getting himself into the center of this town.
And eventually into Odysseus' house.
"And from there, make his connection with Penelope."
"Telemachus, it shows at the beginning of seventeen, has learned the stuff that he was supposed to learn during that journey as he went around to see the great aristocratic friends of his father."
"He learns what it is to be a purposeful, now slightly angry man, who's in charge of a house that other people are abusing."
He starts to move around more purposefully.
"He lays down markers to the suitors telling them that, that things that they're doing are not quite right."
"He guarantees statements that some people make in his own house, so he starts to take responsibility for other things."
And we're going to watch this growing up of Telemachus on display in book seventeen.
"He, at the very beginning of the book lies to Eumaeus about Odysseus, doesn't he?"
So he is now in Odysseus's inner circle of
"lies, and he himself becomes a liar just like his father chosen as growing up to take a different role in his group."
"He says to Eumaeus, take this stranger."
"He knows that it's Odysseus, Eumaeus doesn't."
"Eumaeus, take this stranger to Odysseus' house so he can get some food begging there."
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin to do everything a human being can do.
And we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be.
So we focused on motion capture.
I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.
The state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture.
I'll give you an example here.
"It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard, and they put some reflective markers on your body, and instead of using cameras, there're infrared sensors around a volume, and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time."
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer-generated character.
You can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers.
"But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking, and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process."
"And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance."
That's not terribly compelling.
And what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers.
We needed the subtleties of the skin.
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
"Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art."
So we aborted using motion capture.
"And we were now well out of our comfort zone, and in uncharted territory."
"So we were left with this idea that we ended up calling ""technology stew."""
We started to look out in other fields.
"The idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging, the video game space, and re-appropriate them."
And we had to create kind of a sauce.
And the sauce was code in software that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one.
"Initially, we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s."
"He believed that he could, in fact, catalog the human face."
"And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS."
"He believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face, and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing."
"And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender."
So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.
And then we came across some remarkable technology called Contour.
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face.
There's nowhere else they can go.
This vertex is last.
"So in other words, if we're plan this to successfully compute topological ordering, the only candidate vertices for that final position in the ordering are the sink vertices, that's all that's gonna work."
"If we put another non-sink vertex there we're toast, that's not gonna happen."
"Fortunately, if it's directed acyclic we know there is a sink vertex, so at V, be a sink vertex of G, if there's many sink vertices we pick one arbitrarily, we set"
V's label to be the maximum possible.
"So there's N vertices, we're gonna put that in the Nth position."
"And now we just recurse on the rest of the graph, which has only N minus one vertices."
So how would this work in the example on the right?
"Well in the first iteration, or the first outermost recursive call, the only key, the only sink vertex is this right's most circled in green."
"So there's four vertices, we're gonna give that the label four."
"So then having labeled that four, we delete that vertex and all the edges incident to it, and we recurse on what's left of the graph."
So that will be the left most three vertices plus the left most two edges.
"Now, this graph has two sink vertices after we've deleted four and everything from it."
So both this top vertex and this bottom vertex are sinks in the residual graph.
"So now in the next recursive call, we can choose either of those as our sink vertex."
"Because we have two choices, that generates two topological orderings."
Those are exactly the ones we saw in the example.
"But if, for example, we choose this one to be our sink vertex, then that gets the label three."
Then we recurse just on the northwestern most two edges.
This vertex is the unique sink in that graph.
That gets the label two.
"And then we recurse on the one node graph and that gets the, the label one."
Okay?
"So the reason this works is if you delete vertices from a directed acyclic graph it remains directed acyclic, right you cannot create a cycle just by throwing out some stuff, so every time through the recursion we can find a sink SCC because it has no outgoing arcs to the graph that still have to be assigned labels, there's no way that there's going to be any violations of the topological ordering."
So why does this algorithm work?
"Well there's, there's two quick observations we need."
"So first of all, we need to argue that it makes sense, that in every iteration or in every recursive call, we can indeed find a sink vertex that we can assign in the final position that's still unfilled."
"And the reason for that, is just, if you take a directed acyclic graph, and you delete one or more vertices from it, you're still gonna have a directed acyclic graph."
"Alright, you can't create cycles by just getting rid of stuff."
You can only destroy cycles.
And we started with no cycles.
"G, depth-first search is going to be invoked exactly once from each of the vertices."
"Either U or V could be first, both are possible."
"So, first, let's assume that U is visited by DFS before V. So then what happens?"
"Well, remember what depth-first search does when you invoke it from a node, it's going to find everything findable from that node."
"So, if U is visited before V, that means V doesn't get explored so it's a candidate for being discovered."
"Moreover, there's an arc straight from U to V. So, certainly, DFS invoked at U is going to discover V."
"Furthermore, the recursive call corresponding to the node V, is going to finish, is going to get popped off the program stack before that of U. The easiest way to see this is just to think about the recursive structure of depth-first search."
"So when you call depth-first search from U, that recursive call, that's gonna make further recursive calls to all of the relevant neighbors including V and U's call is not gonna get popped off the stack until V's does beforehand, that's because of the last in first out nature of a stack or of a recursive algorithm."
"So because the current label starts at N, and it gets decremented each time a recursive call ends."
"And because, the assignment, the F value that we assign to a node is exactly the current label at the time that its recursive calls finishes."
"Because V finishes first, it will get, finishing time or an F value that's later."
"So, because V's recursive call finishes before that of U, that means it will be assigned a larger label than U. Remember, the labels keep decreasing as more and more recursive calls get popped off the stack."
So that's exactly what we wanted.
"Now, what's up in the second case, case two?"
So this is where V is visited before U. And here's where we use the fact that the graph has no cycles.
So there's a direct arc from U to V. That means there cannot be any directed path from V all the way back to U. That would create a directed cycle.
"Therefore, DFS, invoked from V, is not going to discover U. There's no directed path from V to U, again, if there was, there would be a directed cycle, so it doesn't find U at all."
"So the recursive call of V, again, is going to get popped before U's is even pushed onto the stack."
"So we're totally done with V before we even start to consider U. So therefore for the same reasons, since V's recursive call finishes first, its label is going to be larger, which is exactly what we wanted to prove."
So that concludes the first quite interesting application of depth-first search.
"In the next video we'll look at an even more interesting one, which computes the strongly connected components of a directed graph."
"This time we can't do it in one depth for search, we'll need two."
"I'm going to do a couple more moment and force problems, especially because I think I might have bungled the terminology in the previous video because I kept confusing clockwise with counterclockwise."
This time I'll try to be more consistent.
Let me draw my lever again.
My seesaw.
"So that's my seesaw, and that is my axis of rotation, or my fulcrum, or my pivot point, whatever you want to call it."
And let me throw a bunch of forces on there.
"So let's say that I have a 10-Newton force and it is at a distance of 10, so distance is equal to 10."
The moment arm distance is 10.
Let's say that I have a 50-Newton force and its moment arm distance is equal to 8.
And that's M-theory.
M-theory explains how the tiniest... as well as the biggest things in the cosmos work.
It also proposes that we all live on a giant and energetic membrane.
Our universe is tethered to this wall by invisible extra dimensions.
"To make matters crazier, M-theory proposes... that six or seven of these dimensions... the extra ones we don't sense every day... are tiny and right in front of your nose."
"At every point of any one of these people walking by... you pick a point, at that point... there will be an incredibly tiny, curled-up... either six or seven dimensions that you just don't perceive."
These membranes are also very close to each other.
You could have one of these membranes being a universe.
"And then, moving sideways... you have another membrane being a separate universe... and they may be just a millimeter or two away."
The giant walls of energetic matter float side by side...
like humongous sheets in the bulk or in hyperspace.
An entire universe may be attached to a brane... or a universe can occupy the whole of another one.
"Our own universe sits on the skin of one of these giant branes... that, in turn, is adrift in the cosmic sea of space."
And it's floating around in a bigger structure called the bulk.
Our three-dimensional universe is like a membrane... floating around within this larger structure.
"Believing that invisible extra dimensions... that, like an umbilical cord, connect us... to a hyper or bulk space where giant membranes live... demands a huge leap of faith."
Where are these membranes that we're stuck to?
And why can't we see these extra dimensions that connect us?
I'm floating around here on this kayak on the surface of the ocean... and you can think of this as a two-dimensional surface.
"But below me, there's a whole 'nother dimension."
There's the down dimension where all the fish live.
You can think of that as the bulk.
"I'm on a membrane, floating around... and the bulk is the other dimension."
The fish down below the surface of the water... are in a different dimension than I am.
They don't even know that I'm here... unless I happen to splash around and hit one on the head... or something like that.
So they might be completely oblivious to my existence... and I could be oblivious to their existence... because we're in different dimensions.
But can a fleeting thought send you into an extra dimension... and on to a parallel universe?
"According to the latest M-theory, in less than an instant... in the first trillionth of a trillionth of a second... membranes in a pre-universe cosmos, like gigantic cosmic cymbals... smashed together and produced the Big Bang."
Over almost 13.7 billion years... a huge expanding bubble of primordial matter... evolved into the universe we now know and love.
"Can crashing membranes create parallel universes, too?"
"If it happened once, it can happen again... and again and again."
So it's possible that there's a continuous cycle... of branes smashing together to produce universes... and that it never stops.
little bit more interesting and we talked a little bit about it in the last video.
You actually want to provide a-- you want to estimate the variance of the population when you're taking the variance of a sample.
And in order to provide an unbiased estimate you do something very similar to here but you end up dividing by n minus 1.
So let me write that down.
"So the variance of a population-- I'm sorry, the variance of a sample or samples variance or unbiased sample variance if that's why we're going to divide by n minus 1."
That's denoted by s squared.
What you do is you take the difference between each of the data points in the sample minus the sample mean.
We assume that we don't know the population mean.
Maybe we did.
If we knew the population mean we actually wouldn't have to do the unbiased thing they were going to do here in the denominator.
But when you have a sample the only way to kind of figure out the population mean is to estimate it with sample mean.
So we assume that we only have the sample mean.
And you're going to square those and then you're going to sum them up from i is equal to 1 to i is equal to n because you have n data points.
And if you want an unbiased estimator you divide by n minus 1.
And we talked a little bit before why you want this to be a n minus 1 instead of a n.
And actually in a couple of videos I'll actually prove this to you.
"One, I'll prove it maybe experimentally using Excel and then I'll-- which wouldn't be a proof, it'll just give you a"
little bit of intuition-- and then I'll actually prove it a little bit more formally later on.
But you don't have to worry about it right now.
"The next thing we'll learn is something that you've probably heard a lot of, especially sometimes in class, teachers talk about the standard deviation of a test or-- it's actually probably one of the most use words in statistics."
I think a lot of people unfortunately maybe use it or maybe use it without fully appreciating everything that it involves.
But the goal we'll eventually hopefully appreciate all that involves soon.
But the standard deviation-- and once you know variance it's actually quite straightforward.
It's the square root of the variance.
So the standard deviation of a population is written as sigma which is equal to the square root of the variance.
And now I think you understand why a variance is written as sigma squared.
And that is equal to just the square root of all that.
It's equal to the square root-- I'll probably run out of space-- of all of that.
"So the sum-- I won't write at the top or the bottom, that makes it messy-- if xi minus Mu squared, everything over n."
"And then if you wanted the standard deviation of a sample-- and it actually gets a little bit interesting because the standard deviation of a sample, which is equal to the square root of the variance of a sample-- it actually turned out that this is not an unbiased estimator for this-- and I don't want to get to technical for it right now-- that this is actually a very good estimate of this."
The expected value of this is going to be this.
And I'll go into more depth on expected values in the future.
You might be tempted to think that you can get away with just cancelling.
What I mean is you might be tempted to think that something like this works. let's say you wanted to differentiate g of f of x.
You might set f of x equal to y.
"And then, you might think, well, what you're really trying to calculate is the derivative of g of y and okay."
"And then, you might say, well, the derivative of g of y, that will be the derivative of g with respect to y times the derivative of y with respect to x, and that's really the Chain rule."
"I mean, this first thing is the derivative of g and this other thing is the derivative of f just like you'd expect, and then you're trying to say that you can just cancel, alright?"
You're not allowed to just cancel.
"I mean, the upshot here is just that dy/dx is not a fraction, alright?"
"You can't justify this equality by just canceling because these objects, the way you're supposedly doing the canceling, they're not fractions."
We need a more delicate argument than that.
One way to go is to give a slightly different definition of derivative.
"Well, here's a slightly different way of packaging up the derivative."
"The function f is differentiable at a point a, provided there's some number, which I""m suggestively calling f prime of a, if the derivative of f at a, so that the limit of this error function is equal to 0."
And what's this error function?
"Well, it's measuring how far my approximation is that I'd get using the derivative from the actual functions output if I plug in an input value near a."
"In some ways, that's actually a nicer definition of derivative, since it really conveys that the derivative provides a way to approximate output values of functions."
"In any case, now, let's take this new definition of derivative and try to prove the Chain rule."
Try to approximate g of f of x plus h.
Try to discover the Chain rules.
"So, I want to be able to express this in terms of the derivative s of g and f, at least, approximately, and then control the error."
"Well, I can do that for f because I'm assuming that f is deferential about the point x."
"So, this is g of, instead of f of x plus h, f of x plus the derivative of f at x times h plus an error term, we should be calling error of f of h times h."
I'm going to play the same game with g.
This is g of f of x plus a small quantity.
"And if I assume that g is differentiable at the point f of x, then this is g of f of x plus the derivative of g at f of x times how much I wiggle by, which, in this case, is f prime of x h plus that error term plus an error term for g, which is the error term for g."
"And I have to put in how much I wiggled by, which, in this case, is f prime of xh plus the error term for f at h times h times that same quantity, f prime of xh plus the error term for f at h times h."
"Alright, so that's exactly equal to g of f of x plus h and I'm including all of the error terms."
"Now, we can expand out a bit."
"So, this is g of f of x plus, you can multiply these two terms together, g prime of f of x times f prime of xh."
"That's looking really good, because that's what the Chain rule is, right?"
It's supposed to give me this as the derivative of g composed with f.
"Plus, I've got a ton of error terms now."
"So, that just means exploiting properties of the mathematical operators, to replace more complex, instruc tions or more complex operations by simpler ones."
One of the most important and useful local optimizations is to compute the results of operations at compile time rather than at run time if the arguments are known at compile time.
"So for example, let's say we have a three-address instruction x=y op z."
And it happens that y and z are both constants.
These are both immediate values.
"These are, you know, literals in the instruction."
"Then we can actually compute the results of the right hand side at compile time, and replace this by an assignment to a constant."
"So, for example, if we have the instruction x=2+2, that can be replaced by the assignment x=4, And another example which is a very common and important one, is if the predicate of a conditional consists only of immediate values."
"Then we can pre-compute the result of that conditional, And, and decide what the target of the conditional will be."
What the next instruction will be at compile time.
"So, in this case, we have a predicate, which is going to be false, because two is not less than zero And so we will not take the jump And so this instruction can just be deleted from the program."
"If we had the, Otherwise if two is greater than zero, so if this is some predicate to valuate true Then we would replace this conditional by the jump."
"Okay, this would become an unconditional jump."
"Alright, And this class of optimization's is called constant folding,"
And as I said this is one of the most common and most important optimizations that compilers perform.
"Now, there is one situation that you should be aware of and which can be very dangerous, and this situation is actually very instructive as well."
"And so while it isn't that common, I, I wanted to mention it, because it really illustrates some of the subtleties of program optimization and programming"
language semantics.
So what is this dangerous situation?
So let's consider the scenario where we have two machines.
We have a machine X And we have a machine.
Why?
Okay and now the compiler is being run on machine X. And the compiler is producing code.
Generated code this is the generated code produced as the output of the compiler over here.
That's gonna be run on machine Y. So this is a cross compiler.
"Okay, So you are running the compiler On one machine, but you're generating code for a different machine, and why would you want to do that?"
Well.
"The, the common situation in which you want to do this is that this machine Y over here is a very weak machine."
So weak in the sense that it's very slow and has very limited memory.
Maybe very limited power then it's beneficial to develop your program and even compile it on a much more powerful machine.
So many embedded Systems codes are developed in exactly this way.
"Code is developed on some powerful workstations that are actually compiling it for some small embedded device that well, executes the code."
"Now, the way you use it, you take this little cord here, put it on the paint, and it tells me there's 894 microns of paint on this car."
"Now, if you get to a lower and a lower and a lower number, at some point it'll tell me that I can't buff the car and I can't restore it."
"So on occasion, I'll come to a customer and say, hey, your paint is really trashed, but there's nothing I can do because I don't want to take away the UV protection or the clear coat on the car."
This machine will tell you that.
"And normally, you can't see it just by looking at it."
You need one of these.
"They are a bit pricey, but they're worth every penny."
"All right, the geekiest tool I have and probably the most fun, is the Dino-Lite microscope."
"Now, the way you use it is you put it on the paint just like this, and it gives me an image on the Mac here of all the scratches in the paint."
It helps me determine whether I've actually repaired the paint or filled it in.
"Now, this here, is really, really high tech."
"Now, as you can see here, we've isolated a very big scratch."
"All these will come out, but this may give us a little bit of trouble, so I'll keep an eye on that."
"Now, that we stripped the car, clayed the car, and taken a microscope and seeing all the little scratches so we get a better idea of how to approach the car, the next thing you want to do is you want to create a test panel."
"Now, what I like to do is pull my masking tape out just like this, break a little piece off, and the trick is to"
lightly tap it on your thigh.
What that does is it removes the extra glue that's on there.
"So when you put it on just like this, when you go to pull it off, there isn't that line that's really annoying that you've got to rub it a little bit extra."
And so I'm going to mask off the rest of this and test this panel right now.
Using tape allows me to see a before and after shot when determining what products and procedures are working and when it's not.
Be sure to keep test areas to one panel only and in the
least conspicuous part of the car.
"Before we can repair the clear coat, it's important to understand what makes up the different layers of paint, how scratches affect your clear coat, and more importantly, how they're removed."
"Brand new paint, or what we call perfect paint, has a flat, glass-like surface that reflects 100% of the light back to your eye, much like a mirror."
"However, over time, with poor cleaning habits, the clear coat will develop minor and sometimes major scratches that reduce the amount of reflection causing it to appear dull."
"Once wax is applied, it acts as a filler to flatten the surface of the clear coat once again making your car look shiny."
"Although the paint looks repaired, it's actually only a temporary or cosmetic solution to the dullness."
"After a few washes, the wax or filler will degrade and the once-covered scratch will be exposed again putting you right back in the same situation."
So what are we to do?
"In this case, since we decided to permanently repair the paint, we need to know a little bit more about abrasives and how they work."
Compounds and polishes work in almost the same way as sandpaper.
"In fact, they are sometimes referred to as liquid sandpaper, because they're delivered and applied to the paint in a fluid instead of the traditional paper."
"They contribute a huge amount to the amount of waste that needs to be dealt with, so, you know, they can make a positive impact by perhaps the hotels that they choose to stay at, making sure, asking, ""ok, what's your environmental policy?"
What do you do with your waste?
"I want to make sure that the waste that I'm creating at this hotel, or what the hotel is creating is ending up at the right place, not going and polluting the rivers and going into the ocean and actually degrading the whole tourist experience."" The whole point of going to a place for a holiday, a nice holiday, is to relax, maybe enjoy the sea, but if there's a bunch of trash in it, then obviously it's not really what you came here for."
So you can ask your hotel what they do with their stuff.
"You can, before coming here, make a pledge to support a local organization that's maybe working to support the environment, to keep the place that you're coming to visit beautiful and functioning, and you can donate to those organization, those non-profits, and support projects like that."
"And, on a larger scale,"
"I would like to see the places, the tourist destinations, perhaps saying that 1% of money that you spend on hotel or food or airline tickets goes to supporting an environmental fund, or a green fund."
"There are places that have done that effectively, like Gili Trawangan, off the coast of Lombok, has the Gili Ecotrust, so you know, just a small amount, I think it's a dollar per day per tourist goes to that fund, and that helps to do the waste management and addresses different environmental issues. / Everyone wants to be green, and basically the first phase of that is you have some pioneers that are being green, and then everyone jumps on the bandwagon and says they're green, and more often than not, unfortunately a lot of people are just saying they're green."
"They might have good intentions, others might not, but it's just a marketing element, and they say ""We're green!"" or ""We recycle, we do that,"" but as people, as customers and people understand that it's not enough just to say that, they have to prove it, they have to explain what they do."
"And even you know, just asking questions and that, it adds up, it helps. / At the top of any waste management plan should always be prevetion first, then reduction, and then you start looking at, ok, well the waste is already there, what can we do with it?"
Can we reuse it?
"Ok, if we can't reuse it, can we recycle it?"
"But it's got to be in that pyramid of priorities. / So what the coalition is doing right now is to encourage business to do waste prevention, we call it Plastic Detox Bali."
"Our community, right now, people right now, are addicted to plastic."
"They tend to freak out, like ""WHAT?"
"No plastic allowed??"""
"We have to keep reminding, we're not anti-plastic; we need plastic."
But you need to learn how to use it wisely.
"So, to help them ease this addiction,"
"I guess, Plastic Detox Bali."
There's a series of actions that business can take.
"Like first, we ask them not to provide plastic bags for free. / What I think should be done on Bali, and perhaps in the rest of Indonesia, but certainly in Bali, is first introduce a bag tax."
Make people pay for it.
Pay for the plastic bag.
Pay for the privilege.
"Pay for the mounting external costs, because then hopefully people will realize this is not free."
People think it's free now and they think it's modern.
"They think free, modernity, nice, ya?"
"""Asik, dong?"""
But it's not.
Because what about the cost of cleaning it up over the long term.
What about the health costs incurred by people who inhale the dioxins created by burning it.
"left end of the ladder was already in the garage, this door stopped the front end but the left hand kept, as seen by the ladder this left hand kept coming."
"So, there is no contradiction, there is a lot of kinetic energy to be lost and there might be a great explosion."
"And, of course, if the latter doesn't blow itself to smitherines, then of course there will be an elastic rebound."
"It will, this, the back end of the latter will now pop back to the right at high speed."
Whoops.
"High speed but less than the speed of light crashing to the garage door and then whatever happens will happen but you can indeed enclose the ladder in the garage, at least in the instant."
And the error that we were making when we were trying to compare the two frames and say you stock the ladder at the front was the assumption was that the ladder is a rigid object.
One of the things we learned here is that the objects with a given shape and size.
Do not make relativistic sense.An object whose pen has a size and the shape in a sense that when I move this side of it.
"And I drop it, the other side moves as well."
"This could not realistically be true, in fact, if you look very closely, it's not true."
"When I move this side, actually the pen bends a little."
"A sound wave goes travelling down the pen, and if it were a slinky with a slower sound wave, you'd be able to see it."
"And when the sound wave reaches here, then and only then, does the other end start rising. when you're dealing in realistic speeds, this little time delay makes all the difference."
So thinking of an object as having a given size in realistic terms is a really bad idea.
"So hopefully we've learned some resul ts of some of the ways to think about relativistic kinematics and hopefully you understand the resolution of the ladder diagram though as I said, it takes seeing the solution and then thinking about it a lot and arguing and I hope the forums will be lively."
A perhaps even more famous paradox of special relativity is the twin paradox.
And the twin paradox I'm going to demonstrate graphically.
"We won't do too many calculations there's not much to compute, so what's the story with the twin paradox?"
We have two twin brothers or sisters and they live until some age on Earth.
"And then, at some point, one of them gets into a spaceship traveling at high speed in some direction. close to relativistic speed, or traveling for a long time."
And for a long time this twin travels off into space.
"So, he's going moving to the right."
"And then after have achieving, achieved a certain distance, he hops on another spaceship moving at the same speed but in the opposite direction."
"And, after a while returns to Earth and gets reunited with his twin."
"Now of course, when they left they were the same age."
"So the question is when twin number two returns from his voyage, who is younger?"
Are they the same age and the answer is no.
They are not the same age and it's easy to make that calculation but then its puzzling to understand.
"Wait a minute, so let's first start with the question who is younger."
Well.
"We have here the usual two events, event number zero and event number one and the Coordinates of these events, again I have my usual axis x prime, t prime t double prime here is the a new time axis which is the world line of the twin number two on his return but I'm gonna start by dealing with this segment, it is sort of clear by symmetry that everything that happens along this segment happens symmetrically along this segment."
We can also get to
Las Vegas and this mysterious
CMH I wish I remembered what it were.
So now if we're interested in finding the cheapest way to get from A to B then We'll add where the destination equals
B on here and we'll add the minimum total cost and hopefully that will be our good old 175 and indeed it is.
By the way we can do the same basic idea but backwards.
Instead of finding all the places that we can get from city A how about if we find all the places from which we can get to city
B. So here's the query that does that.
"To B is going to be our recursively define relation that's going to give us the origin, the place from which we can get to B and the total cost of getting to B from that place."
"So again, the structure is exactly parallel."
We start out with our base query saying if we have a direct flight to B then we can get from the origin of that direct flight at the cost of the flight to
B and we then recursively add flights on that you can think of if your going from left to right adding flights from the left.
So if we know we can get from a place to B and then we can go from...take a direct flight from somewhere else to that place And we can get from that somewhere else to be.
"Anyway so we do that again by joining so we're going to take our origin from which we can get to B we're going to find flight that take us to that origin, we're going to add the cost of that flight and that gives us a new way to get to B. And then let me start by just writing the query that all of the places from which we can get to B and the cost of getting there."
We'll run the query.
And we can see that we can get to B from point
A in 3 different ways and from our other cities in our database as well.
"Similarly, to what we did previously, if we're particularly interested in getting from A to B, whoops, let's make that our origin then we add where origin equals a and if we want the minimum it would be our minimum total again paralleling exactly what we did before."
We run it and good old 175 comes out.
"Now we're going to have some real fun because I added another flight to our database, and this flight takes us from Columbus, I now know its Columbus, to Phoenix and creates a loop in our flights."
So that means that we can fly from A to
"B next to Las Vegas, to"
"Columbus, back to Phoenix and then to Las Vegas and Columbus again."
"So, we're going to have arbitrarily, actually unbounded, actually infinite, length routes that we can take now."
"Now, obviously those routes aren't going to ever be the cheapest way because as we take those roots it's going to get more and more expensive, none of them are negative costs paying us to take flights."
But if we just do our naive recursion where we generate all of our roots before we take a
look at our final query then we're going to be generating an infinite number of roots.
"So here's our original enquiry, the first one we wrote, where we were just finding all of the costs of getting from A to B by computing all of the roots in the entire database and then looking at those from"
A to B. Now with our additional flight that creates a loop we run this command and nothing happens.
Actually if we wait long enough we're going to get an error.
"Well, okay we waited for a while. appears that the user interface we're using isn't going to show us the error."
"But if you try running this in post risk command line interface,"
So the garage stretches from x = zero to x =
"G, so in the garages coordinates, the garage itself where this is x and t."
The garage will be something like this.
And this will be the point x = g.
"And the garage is stationary so it just sits there, the interior is the garage."
I will pick the left end of the ladder to be x prime equals zero.
"And so, of course the"
"left, the ladder is moving to the right, so if I set things up right and I am going to try to do that is in the standard way that I like the world line at the left end of the garage which is also because it is x prime equals zero."
This is going to be my t prime access.
"This is, describes the motion, the straight world line, describes the motion of the left end of the ladder."
"And at some point, which I am going to call by convention, t equals zero and also t prime equal to zero."
"I will call that, pick as that event, event number one, or event number zero if you want."
The instant when the. left end of the ladder enters the garage.
"So at this point, the ladder is all the way to the left of the garage. what about the right end of the ladder?"
"Well, the right end of the ladder will be by con, by construction a distance I as seen in the primed coordinates to the right of the left end of the garage."
"So at coordinate x prime, of the right side of the garage is equal to I, and it too of course will be moving at speed v, at the same speed v. So its world line is going to be a parallel line here. this is the world line spiritually drawn, of the right end of the garage and as you've, as I've drawn it you can definitely see that at t equals zero, when the left end of the garage of the ladder enters the garage, the right end of the ladder has not yet exited the garage, and therefore at this point and in fact throughout the time that I am going to mark out here."
"The, this whole region is a region where the ladder is contained in the garage and then at this time, the right end emerges first and later the left end emerge s."
So the fact that I've drawn this to exist is the statement that while G is less than L G is bigger than the square root of one - v^2 / c^2 L. I have made the velocity high enough that the Lorentz Contracted Ladder does fit in the garage.
"Okay so this is event, the event that I'll call event number one and this here is event number two, event number two is the instant when the right end of the ladder is about emerge from the garage and that occurs of course at the position x^2 is equal to G as seen by the, by the garage frame and of course at that same, at that same instant, at that event, is the event where the world line of x prime equals L which is this blue line, the motion of the right side of the garage intersect x2 = g."
"So, that's event number two."
The intersection of this green line with that blue line and
I can compute it.
In a moment I will.
"And then, the question of whether the ladder is inside the garage at any point or not, is the question of which event came first."
"If event number one, the left end of the ladder coming into the garage precedes event number two, the right end of the ladder emerging from the garage, then the"
ladder's in the garage.
"And in this picture it clearly is as seen in the frame of the garage. but the question is if on the other hand event number two precedes event number one, that means the right end of the ladder protrudes from the garage before the left end was in."
The ladder was never in the garage.
So let's figure out the order of these two events and again we will use Lorentz Transformations.
So I've written out here the full set of Lorentz Transformations front and back forwards and backwards as you note they only differ by flipping the sign of'v'.
And then.
I am going to ask what is the time as seen by the garage frame at which this world line of the right side of the garage meets the world line of the right side of the
So I said the first modification we need is to embed this into an outer for loop to ensure that every single node gets labeled so I'm gonna call that subroutine DFS-loop.
It does not take a start vertex.
Initialization all nodes start out unexplored of course.
And we're also going to keep track of a global variable which I'll call current label.
This is going to be initialized to N and we're gonna count down each time we finish exploring a new node.
And these will be precisely the F values.
These will be exactly the positions of the vertices in the topological ordering that we output.
"In the main, in the main loop we're gonna iterate over all of the nodes of the graph."
"So, for example, we just do a scan through the node array."
"As usual, we don't wanna do any work twice, so for a, if a vertex has already been explored in some previous indication of DFS, we don't, we don't search from it."
"This should all be familiar from our embedding a breadth-first search in a for loop when we computed the connected components of an undirected graph, and if we get to a vertex V of the graph that we haven't explored yet, then we just invoke DFS in the graph with that vertex as the starting point."
"So, the final thing I need to add is I need to tell you what the F values are with the actually assignments of vertices to positions are."
And as I foreshadowed we're going to use this global current label variable and that will have us assign vertices to positions from right to the left.
Very much mimicking what was going on our recursive solution where we plucked off sink vertices one at a time.
So when's the right time to assign a vertex its position?
"Well, it turns out the right time is when we've completely finished with that vertex."
So we're about to pop the recursive call from the stack corresponding to that vertex.
"So after we've gone through the for loop of all the edges outgoing from a given vertex, we set F of S equal to whatever the current label is and then we decrement the current label."
And that's it.
That is the entire algorithm.
"So, the claim is going to be that the F values produced, which you'll notice, are going to be the integers between N through one, because"
DFS will be called eventually once on every vertex and it will get some integer assignment at the end.
And everybody's gonna get a distinct value and the largest one is N and the smallest one is one.
The claim is that is a topological ordering.
"Clearly this algorithm is just as blazingly fast as DFS itself, with just a trivial amount of extra bookkeeping."
Let's see how it works on our running example.
"So let's just say we have this four node directed graph, which we're getting quite used to."
So this has four vertices.
So we initialize the current label variable to be equal to four.
Let's say in the outer DFS loop we begin from S. So that means this will be the only DFS call that ever gets that ever gets used.
"So let's say that, in the outer DFS loop, let's stay we start somewhere like the vertex V. So notice, in this outer for loop, we wind up considering the vertices in a totally arbitrary order."
So let's say we first call DFS from this vertex V. So what happens?

Siegbert Tarrasch
"Siegbert Tarrasch (Breslau, now Wrocław, 5 March 1862 – Munich, 17 February 1934) was a German doctor, and one of the strongest chess grandmasters of the day."
"Tarrasch was born in Breslau, in Prussian Silesia. He left in 1880 to study medicine, and qualified as a physician. He lived most of his life in Nuremberg, Bavaria, and later in Munich. Tarrasch was born Jewish, and converted to Christianity in 1909. He was a patriotic German, who lost a son in World War I, but he faced antisemitism in the early stages of Nazism."
"Tarrasch won more strong tournaments in the 1890s than any other player, and drew a 22-game match against Mikhail Chigorin, the leading Russian player. Tarrasch was also an influential chess writer, who summarised the chess ideas of the 1890s. It was his ideas against which the hypermoderns reacted in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name=""H/W""&gt;Hooper D. and Whyld K. 1992. ""The Oxford companion to chess"". 2nd ed, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;p411"
"Occupied with his profession, Tarrasch did not challenge Steinitz, and turned down the young Emanuel Lasker's request for a match. This turned out to be a mistake, for Lasker then challended Steinitz, and won the world chess championship. Later Tarrasch unsuccessfully challenged Lasker for the world championship, in 1908. He was by then past his best, though he continued to play in tournaments for many years. His best result in later years was to reach the final pool in the strong St. Petersburg 1914 tournament. He came fourth, behind Lasker, Capablanca and Alekhine."
Chess author.
"Tarrasch was a highly esteemed chess writer. His ""Dreihundert Schachpartien"" (1895; 300 chess games) was a landmark; it was the first 'best game collection' with in-depth annotations. The notes were readable and could be understood by ordinary players. This led to his being described as the ""praeceptor mundi"", which is Latin for 'teacher of the world'. The book was called by the American grandmaster Reuben Fine ""One of the monuments of our game"".f/w"
"Tarrasch regularly wrote tournament reports and notes for games in the ""Deutsch Schachzeitung"", the German-language chess magazine. These annotations were read throughout the world, since that was the leading chess magazine of the day."
"In his later elementary textbook ""The game of chess"" (1931) he wrote"

Research with Wright will have a poetic development and dialogue in many of his future creations of strong identity. The researches with Wright in an artistically unknown America in Italy will continue for years both in Arizona and in Wisconsin, also comparing themselves with other designers such as Auguste Perret, Richard Neutra in California, [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe] ] in Chicago to then reach his own and totally avant-garde Italian rationalist system upon his return to Italy, although open to different types of contaminations that created a concept of avant-garde design that is unique in the world."
"Since the early 1950s he has dedicated himself to the design of industrial design often together with [[Angelo Mangiarotti]], his furniture has the characteristic of being free of junctions, thanks to the joint, ""tables, stools, benches and bookcases that combine functionality and decoration, freely assembled and easy to pack ""."

Nepali tea
"Tea plants grown in Nepal, are used to make tea. This tea is called Nepali tea. These plants look, smell, and taste a bit different from other tea plants. They are similar to the tea plants grown in Darjeeling, which are used to make Darjeeling tea. This may be because the eastern parts of Nepal are geographically similar to the Darjeeling region. Darjeeling produces a lot more tea than Nepal. For this reason, tea from Nepal is not as well-known."
There are two types of Nepali tea:
Orthodox tea.
"Like Darjeeling Tea, Orthodox Tea is made from the Chinese variety of tea plants. The tea is rolled by hand, or using a machine. Most speciality teas like green tea, oolong tea, white tea, and hand rolled tea fall under the category of orthodox tea. In Nepal, Orthodox Tea is produced and processed in the mountain regions, at altitudes between and . There are six major districts, primarily in the eastern regions of Nepal that are known for producing quality orthodox tea. They are Ilam, Panchthar, Dhankuta, Terhathum, Sindhulpalchok and Kaski."

Discourses on Livy
"The Discourses on Livy, also Discourses or Discorsi, was written around 1517 and published in 1531 by Niccolò Machiavelli."
It is a discussion about the history of early Ancient Rome. Although it strays very far from this and also uses modern political examples to illustrate points. Machiavelli presents it as a series of lessons on how a republic should be started and structured.
"While it more openly explains the advantages of republics, it also has many similar themes from his other works. For example, Machiavelli said that to save a republic from corruption, it is needed to return it to a ""kingly state"" using violent means. He excuses Romulus for killing his brother Remus and co-ruler Titus Tatius to gain absolute power for himself in that he made a ""civil way of life"". Commentators disagree about how much the two works agree with each other, as Machiavelli often refers to leaders of republics as ""princes"". Machiavelli even sometimes acts as an advisor to tyrants. Other scholars have pointed out the power-hungry and imperialistic features of Machiavelli's republic. Nevertheless, it became one of the central texts of modern republicanism."
Product rule
"In differential calculus, the product rule is a rule that helps calculate derivates that have multiplication."
formula_1
formula_2.
Steps.
Say we have the function formula_3.
The two functions being multiplied are formula_4 and formula_5.
We can set
formula_6 and
formula_7.
The rule needs us to find the derivative of both formula_8 and formula_9.
"We can find formula_10 by first using the sum rule to split formula_8 into formula_12 and formula_13. After using the power rule, we have formula_14."
"To find formula_15, we need to find the derivative of formula_5, which is formula_17, meaning formula_18."
"Now we can substitute the values into the equation,"
formula_19.
Proof.
One definition of a derivative is
"formula_20, and we're trying to find the derivative of formula_21, so we can first set formula_22 to formula_21."
formula_24
We can't really do much with this so we need to manipulate the equation.
formula_25
"The formula_26 part is equal to formula_27, meaning it didn't change the value of the equation. Now we can factor,"
"formula_28, and because formula_29 approaches formula_27, formula_31 is equal to formula_32."
"formula_33, and formula_34 and formula_35 are just equal to formula_15and formula_37."
"James Francis Thorpe (May 28, 1888 – March 28, 1953) was an American athlete in track, football, and baseball. Thorpe was part Native American and was from Oklahoma. He played football, track, and six other sports at Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. While at Carlisle, Thorpe's team was one of the best in the country, and beat an Army team that had Dwight Eisenhower. Thorpe won gold medals in the pentathlon (five track and field events in one day) and decathlon (ten events in two days) at the 1912 Summer Olympics. After the decathlon, the King of Sweden called him the greatest athlete alive. His medals were taken away because he had played professional baseball, but were returned in 1982, long after his death."
"After the Olympics, Thorpe played professional baseball and football. He played for football teams including the Canton Bulldogs, Rock Island Independents, Chicago Cardinals and New York Giants. He was commissioner of the NFL for one year. Thorpe is in the NFL Hall of Fame. He also played for baseball teams including the New York Giants, Cincinnati Reds, and Boston Braves For several years, Thorpe toured with football, baseball and basketball teams that only had Native American players.

Crocodylomorph
The Crocodylomorphs are an important group of archosaurs. It includes the crocodilians and their extinct relatives. They were the only members of Pseudosuchia to survive the end-Triassic extinction.
During Mesozoic and early Tertiary times the Crocodylomorphs were much more diverse than they are now.
"They were originally small, lightly built, active land animals. These were replaced during the early Jurassic by various aquatic and marine forms. The later Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary saw a wide diversity of terrestrial and semi-aquatic lines."
Modern crocodilians do not appear until the Upper Cretaceous.
Evolutionary history.
"The crocodylian lineage (clade Crurotarsi) were a very diverse group of reptiles. Not only are they an ancient group of animals, at least as old as the dinosaurs, they also evolved into a great variety of forms."
"The earliest forms, the sphenosuchians, evolved during the Upper Triassic. They were slim land animals built like greyhounds. During the Jurassic and the Cretaceous, marine forms evolved forelimbs that were paddle-like and had a tail similar to modern fish."
"The group had a wider range of habitats and behaviours than it does at present. ""Dakosaurus andiniensis"", a species closely related to ""Metriorhynchus"", had a skull adapted for eating large marine reptiles. Several terrestrial species during the Cretaceous evolved herbivory. A number of lines during the Tertiary and Pleistocene became wholly land predators."
Lepidosauromorph
The Lepidosauromorphs are a large group of reptiles. It includes all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs.
"The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: lizards, snakes, and the tuatara."
"The most important fossil group, the Sauropterygia, includes the plesiosaurs."

"Since Bush had the same first and last names as his son, he was often called George H. W. Bush or George Bush Sr. (George Bush senior). Some people call him ""41"" or ""Bush 41"" because he was the 41st President."
Comments on broccoli.
"In 1990, President of the United States, George H. W. Bush, made a casual remark about broccoli (a vegetable), and said he would never eat it."
"The President made this comment in 1990, shortly after a journalist from the U.S. News &amp; World Report broke the story that Bush banned the vegetable from Air Force One. George S. Dunlop, President of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, gave First Lady Barbara Bush a bouquet of the vegetable an additional 10 tons in trucks."
"A few days afterwards, Bush hosted a state dinner to honor Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Prime Minister of Poland, and journalists noted there was no broccoli on the menu, as most of the 10 tons of broccoli given to the President's family by the farmers had been donated to the Capital Area Food Bank."
Ohio
Ohio is one of the 50 states in the United States. Its capital is Columbus. Columbus is also the largest city in Ohio.
"Other large cities in Ohio are Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton, Akron, Toledo, and Youngstown."
"Some famous people from Ohio include golfer , Wilbur and Orville Wright, astronauts John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, authors Sherwood Anderson and Toni Morrison, and actors Clark Gable and Katie Holmes. There have also been seven American presidents from Ohio: Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford Hayes, James Garfield, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, William Howard Taft, Warren G. Harding."
"Ohio is important in elections because it is a swing state. Candidates often campaign a lot there and prior to 2020, the last time they voted for the losing candidate was 1960. Also, no Republican has ever won the presidency without carrying this state. Ohio has both farmland and cities, and there is a lot of discrimination against black people. It is a part of the Midwest. Ohio is the 7th most populated state in the United States of America."
Geography.
"Ohio borders Pennsylvania, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia, and it shares a water border with Ontario, Canada. Western Ohio is mostly flat farmland, with some hills. Southern and Southeastern Ohio is near the Appalachian Mountains, and is the most mountainous part of the state. Most of this area is covered by forests. This part of Ohio is home to the Ohio River, the Wayne National Forest, and the Hocking Hills, which has waterfalls and canyons."
"Central Ohio is mostly rolling hills, and is home to Columbus. Northeast Ohio is dominated by the Lake Erie coast and has a mix of cities and countryside."
Economy.
"For many years, industry and manufacturing was the biggest part of Ohio's economy. Youngstown was a big steel producer, as was Cleveland. Other manufacturing - including the car industry - was a major factor across the state. Since the 1970s, industry has shrank in Ohio, but it is still a big part of the local economy. Today, other businesses are more prominent. Cleveland is one of the biggest hubs for Healthcare, and its main hospital, the famous Cleveland Clinic, is the largest employer in the region. Banking is also a major business, and foods and retail are too. Cincinnati plays host to the headquarters of Fifth Third Bank, Cintas, Kroger, Luxottica, Procter &amp; Gamble and Macy's, whereas, Columbus hosts the headquarters of LBrands, JPMorgan Chase, Huntington Bank, Rogue Fitness, Wendy's, Big Lots, Cardinal Health and Nationwide Insurance. In addition The J.M. Smucker Company and Key Bank are also based in Ohio."

Greek can mean:
Relativity
The word relativity usually means two things in physics:
Principle of relativity
"In physics, the principle of relativity is the requirement that the equations describing the laws of physics is as same as the all frames of reference."
"In 300 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle thought that heavy objects fall faster than objects that are not heavy. The natural science of Aristotle was most popular in Western thought for 2,000 years."
"Ashford Black Marble is a kind of limestone which contains some carbon, and its particles are very small. Its dark color is from bitumen, and once cut and polished, the surface shines."
"At first the rock was mined from Arrock Mine, and later in 1832 from nearby Rookery Plantation, near Ashford-in-the-Water."
Manufacturing techniques.
"Ashford Black Marble can be manufactured into pots, candlesticks and other similar objects, or sawn to make smooth, flat items such as obelisks and paper weights. Derby Museum and Art Gallery has collections of worked and part-worked items of Ashford Black Marble, acquired from an inlaying workshop owned by the Tomlinson family. This collection also includes pieces of stones which were cut and ready to put into the black marble background. Forget-me-not and lily of the valley were typically designed. Various stones were used with Ashford Black Marble: Greys, blues and purples stones are from Monyash. ""Rosewood"" from Nettler Dale in Sheldon is a kind of barytes and has red and white layers. Castleton Blue John from Crich is a kind of flourspar and has purple and yellow colors. ""Birds-Eye"" rock has a design made from the fossils in it. ""Duke's Red"" is so valuable that it was stored at Chatsworth House. The tabletop design illustrated shows some of the combinations described here."
"In the late 1780s, Derbyshire geologist White Watson made geological picture boards using Ashford Black Marble into which other local rocks were inlaid. These boards show layers of rock in different parts of the county. Derby Museum has a diagram of Ecton Hill made from Ashford Black Marble and other minerals."
"William Martin was once a partner with Watson, and wrote the first scientific study of fossils. His ""Petrifacta Derbiensia"" says that White Watson's uncle and workers at the Black Marble mine called some of the fossils ""crocodile tails"", because they thought they were the remains of crocodiles."
"In 2006, Buxton Museum bought the Black Marble collection that had been left by John Michael Tomlinson. He had spent over 50 years to collect them after finding that his ancestors had been involved in Ashford Black Marble manufacturing."
Tasmanian Wilderness
"The Tasmanian Wilderness is a term that is used for a range of areas in Tasmania, Australia."
"The World Heritage Areas in South West Tasmania, Western Tasmania and Central Highlands are the most well known."
"However, there are also other wilderness areas in Tasmania, Tarkine and the Cradle mountain wilderness. There is also an organisation known as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society."
"The World Heritage Area is one of the largest conservation areas in Australia, covering 13,800 km², or almost 20% of Tasmania. The area constitutes one of the last expanses of temperate wilderness in the world, including the renowned South West Wilderness. The area became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982, and it was extended in 1989. It is important for both its natural value but also its cultural values as well."
"Remains found in limestone caves show that humans have lived in the area for well over 20,000 years."
"The Tasmanian Tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae. The last known specimen died in captivity in 1936.p77 The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian Devil; it is the size of a small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger.p46 It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania.p69"

Christina Onassis
"Christina Onassis (December 11, 1950 – November 19, 1988) was a Greek-Argentine businesswoman and socialite. She was the heiress to the Onassis family fortune. She was the only daughter of Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman, and Athina Livanos."
"Onassis was born at LeRoy Sanitarium in New York City, United States, but she gave up her American citizenship. She had a brother, Alexander Onassis. Her daughter, by Thierry Roussel, is Athina Onassis Roussel (named after Christina's mother). Christina died in Buenos Aires from a heart attack. She was aged 37. Her heart attack was caused by pulmonary edema."
Athina Onassis
"Athina Onassis Roussel (alternate: Athina Onassis de Miranda; born 28 January 1985) is a French-Greek heiress. Her grandfather was Aristotle Onassis, a wealthy shipping businessman. She is his only living descendant. Her mother was Christina Onassis. Athina inherited her grandfather's fortune when her mother died in 1988."

Arrogance
"Arrogance (also called hubris) indicates strong pride or acting extremely self-important. In particular, a loss of contact with reality and overestimating one's own competence or capability."
It is when you try to reason out or state your case over a traffic violation to an enforcer - only in the Philippines.
Arrogance is also associated with lack of humility and love toward oneself. Examples include making oneself far more important than others or superiority. Children raised around arrogance may be arrogant themselves.
"Arrogance is usually detrimental and fosters a negative-minded culture. Some sources, however, also indicate arrogance means taking and receiving pride with one's work."
Arrogance is different from confidence. Arrogance may be associated with insecurity. Confidence has an association with improving and examining one's own weaknesses.
"Hubris is the ancient Greek concept. It is similar to arrogance, but is usually translated as ""pride"". Because their societies were more concerned with honour, it works out as somewhat different from arrogance. To understand it fully one needs to work through the Greek passages where it is used, which is beyond our scope. For example, the use of force to shame someone would have been considered hubris."

North East MRT line
The North East MRT Line (NEL) is the third Mass Rapid Transit line in Singapore. The line is 20 km long with 16 stations and operated by SBS Transit. Travelling from one end of this line to the other end takes about half an hour. This line is coloured purple in the rail map.
"The line joins central Singapore to the north-eastern part of the island. Transfer to the North South Line is done at Dhoby Ghaut station, East West Line at Outram Park station, Circle Line at Serangoon and Dhoby Ghaut and Downtown MRT Line at Chinatown and Little India stations."
"This line is the first MRT line in Singapore to be completely underground (running in a tunnel all the way between HarbourFront and Punggol). It is also the first (and so far, the only) line where trains get their power from overhead wires above the track, instead of a third rail beside the track."
All the trains on the North East Line are automated (computer-controlled) and do not have an operator driving the train at the front. It is one of the world's first rapid transit lines that does not need drivers and is one of three such lines in the MRT network today. The others are the Circle Line and the Downtown Line.
Stations.
"The Land Transport Authority has announced that it will extend the North East Line from its current northern terminal at Punggol to a new station called Punggol Coast. Construction will begin in 2018, and it is expected to open in 2023."
List of Singapore MRT stations
"The following lists all rail stations of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in Singapore, with underground stations listed in ""italics"". There are 151 stations in operation. Many more are in various stages of planning and construction (as shown in the latest system map)."
At bat
"In baseball, an at bat (AB) or time at bat is used for certain statistics. These statistics include batting average, on base percentage, and slugging percentage. It is a more narrow definition of a plate appearance. A batter starts with an at bat every time he faces a pitcher; however, the batter gets ""no time at bat"" in the following cases:"
Section 10.02.a.1 of the official rules of Major League Baseball defines an at bat as:
"""Number of times batted, except that no time at bat shall be charged when a player: (1) hits a sacrifice bunt or sacrifice fly; (2) is awarded first base on four called balls; (3) is hit by a pitched ball; or (4) is awarded first base because of interference or obstruction..."""
Examples.
An at bat is counted when:
Cal Ripken Jr.
"Calvin Edwin ""Cal"" Ripken, Jr. (born August 24, 1960), nicknamed ""Iron Man"", is a former Major League Baseball shortstop and third baseman. He played his whole 21-year baseball career for the Baltimore Orioles (1981–2001)."
"Ripken is perhaps best known for breaking New York Yankees first baseman Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played. The record had been called too hard to break. He beat the 56-year-old record when he played in his 2,131st straight game on September 6, 1995 between the Orioles and the California Angels in front of a sold-out crowd at Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Ripken hit a home run in the game the night before that tied Gehrig's record and another home run in his 2,131st game. Fans later voted this game as Major League Baseball's ""Most Memorable Moment"" in MLB history. Ripken played in an 501 more straight games over the next three years. His streak ended at 2,632 games when he removed his name from the lineup for the final Orioles home game of the 1998 season. His record 2,632 straight games lasted over seventeen seasons, from May 30, 1982 to September 20, 1998."
"A 19-time All-Star and member of the 3000 hit club, Ripken is considered one of the best shortstops and third basemen to ever play the game. At 6' 4"" (1.93 m), 225 lbs. (102.27 kg), he led the way for taller, larger shortstops to be successful in that position. When voted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007, he was a first ballot inductee with the third highest voting percentage (98.53%) in Hall of Fame history, behind Tom Seaver (98.84%) and Nolan Ryan (98.79%)."
"He is a best-selling author and the President and CEO of Ripken Baseball, Inc. The company's goal is to grow the love of baseball from a more grassroots level. Established in 2001, Ripken Baseball represents Cal and his brother Bill's business and philanthropy dealings and focuses on several subsidiaries: Ripken Management and Design, Youth Camps and Clinics, Cal Ripken, Sr. foundation, Ripken Professional Baseball, with three minor-league teams—the Aberdeen IronBirds (affiliated with the Orioles); the Augusta GreenJackets (affiliated with the San Francisco Giants); and the Charlotte Stone Crabs (affiliated with the Tampa Bay Rays)—and Ironclad Authentics."
"Martin Luther King, Jr. was staying at the Gaston Motel when it was bombed on May 11th. Fortunately, he had departed earlier. In the residence of A.D. King, King's younger brother, another explosion exploded. In response to the explosions, the demonstrators became more violent. They rioted across the city, torching buildings and cars and assaulting police officers. To restore control, soldiers from the United States Army were dispatched."
The Youth Protest.
"Despite its best efforts, the campaign did not receive the national attention that its strategists had hoped for. They decided to include students in the demonstrations. On May 2, almost a thousand African-American kids skipped school to join the protests. Demonstrators quickly overflowed the cells in Birmingham. With the cells full. He used police dogs and fire hoses on the kids. Images of children being hosed down and dogs being mauled made national headlines. The protests had drawn the attention of the entire country."
Results.
"Despite the fact that there were still numerous issues with racism, the Birmingham campaign helped to break down several barriers to segregation. When the new school year began in September of 1963, the schools were likewise integrated. The campaign's most important effect was the nationalization of the issues and the engagement of leaders like President John F. Kennedy."
Louisville metropolitan area
"The Louisville Metropolitan Area is the area that spreads in Kentucky and Indiana and is more commonly known as by the public as ""Kentuckiana""."
Yakutian horse
"The Yakutian (Yakut: Саха ата, Sakha ata) or Yakut is a horse breed that is native to the Republic of Sakha (or Yakutia) in Siberia. It is similar to the Mongolian horse and Przewalski's horse, but is larger than them. It is special because of how it adapts to the very cold climate of Yakutia. It is able to find and graze on vegetation that is hidden under deep snow. It can survive without shelter in temperatures that reach −70 °C (−94 °F)."
Breed traits.
"The breed averages 140 centimetres (13.3 hands) in stallions and 136 cm (13.2 h) in mares. It has a sturdy stature, thick mane, and heavy hair coat. It shares these traits with other northern horse breeds, like the Shetland pony, Fjord horse, and Icelandic horse."

Controversy.
"In September 2016, Mark Halsey, a former member and a referee, claimed that PGMOL asked him to cover up the truth in match reports. PGMOL denied the claim, and no further action was taken."
Open protocol
"Unlike the early sauropsids, ""Hylonomus"" and its kin, ""Archaeothyris"" was relatively large, measuring head to tail. It was also more advanced than the early sauropsids (~reptiles), with strong jaws that could open wider than those of the sauropsids. Its sharp teeth were all of the same shape, and it had a pair of enlarged canines, suggesting that it was a carnivore."
"""Archaeothyris"" lived in what is now Nova Scotia, about 306 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period (Pennsylvanian). Nova Scotia at this time was a swamp, similar to today's Everglades in Florida. The 'trees' (actually giant clubmosses) were very tall. Some, such as ""Lepidodendron"", were up to tall. ""Archaeothyris"" and the other early amniotes lived on the forest floor."

Canine tooth
"Canine teeth are found in mammals. They are the eye teeth, fangs or dogteeth. They are on either side of the incisors. Their main function is to hold food firmly in order to tear it apart, and also attack and defence."
"In some mammals they are weapons of attack and defence. Examples are: wolves and dogs; the cat family; walrus. Baboons and the great apes have large canines, especially the adult males. In humans they are much reduced, and sit in line with the other teeth."
Premolar
The premolar teeth of mammals are the teeth between the canines and the molars. There are at most a total of eight of them. The number is reduced in the dental formula of many species.
"As the name suggests, they are like smaller molars, and their function is to crush and grind food."
Water park
"A water park (occasionally written as ""waterpark"") is an theme park that features water play areas, such as water slides, splash pads, spraygrounds (water playgrounds), lazy rivers, or other recreational bathing, swimming, and barefooting environments. Water parks in more current states of development may also have some type of artificial surfing or bodyboarding environment such as a wave pool or FlowRider."
Evolution of water parks.
"Water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The United States has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over a thousand water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are IAAPA (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA (World Waterpark Association)."
"Water parks emerging from spas continue to more closely resemble mountain resorts as they become four-season destinations-for example, Splash Universe Water Park Resort, a member of the World Water Park Association, is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the communities' destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure time industry is becoming more concentrated as winter sports are becoming commonplace themes in summertime water rides. A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid segments of theme-, amusement-, and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented; e.g. Schwaben Quellen, a member of European Waterparks Association (EWA) has no water slides, but instead has many saunas, steam rooms, ""adventure showers"", and relaxation-oriented water play areas."
"From 2000's, popular water parks were disclosed by long wait line problems of attractions. To solve this problem, some water parks adapt conveyor belt to lift passengers or use water jets."
A unique feature at a water park is ice skating. Deep River Waterpark in northwestern Indiana features ice skating thanks to cooling pipes that were added under their massive plaza during a recent expansion.
Indoor water parks.
"The first ever indoor water park was built in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1985 at the West Edmonton Mall as part of the $1.2 billion dollar Phase III expansion. Called World Waterpark, it is over in size. It also includes one of the world's largest indoor wave pool, waterslides of varying degrees, tube rides, bungee jumping, and hot tubs."
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between countries mostly means the rights a Sovereign state has over its territory."
Sometimes there is discussion about when a government loses Sovereignty because it is doing bad things for its people. In this case justice may mean other countries need to intrude on the sovereignty of the government.
Inside a Country.
"""Sovereignty"" when talking about relations between groups inside one country usually means which group has the Legitimacy to rule. This may not be certain. Sometimes the group who is most able to rule (because of a strong military) is not Legitimate."
FIFA
"The (FIFA ; French for ""International Federation of Association Football"") is the organization that controls international football (also called ""association football""). The organization’s main buildings are in Zürich, Switzerland. FIFA organizes major international football tournaments, and the most famous one is the FIFA World Cup, which has been held since 1930. FIFA was established on May 21, 1905 in Paris and has 209 national associations as its members. The organization’s official languages are English, French, German and Spanish."
"The president of FIFA is currently Gianni Infantino, serving since 26 February 2016."
"The most powerful organ of FIFA is the FIFA Congress, which is an assembly made up of representatives from each member association. The Congress holds a regular meeting once a year, and since 1998 an additional meeting has been held every year. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's laws."
"The Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of FIFA's executive committee. The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA. The executive committee, with the President as its head, is responsible for deciding the dates, locations and format of tournaments."
"Also, there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the seven different continents of the world. National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFA's competitions. The six confederations are AFC (Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia), CAF (Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa), CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America), CONMEBOL (Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol in South America), OFC (Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania) and UEFA (Union Européenne de Football Association in Europe)."

Smile
"A smile is a face made by flexing the muscles near both ends of the mouth. The smile can also be made through the eyes (See 'Duchenne smile' below). Smiles usually express happiness. A smile can be natural or fake. However, smiling can be different with animals. When smiling, the teeth shows, but sometimes animals do this when they are threatening. When chimpanzees show their teeth, it can also be a sign of fear."
Dimples.
"Dimples are genetically inherited. They are caused by the flesh underneath the skin, that forms on some people's cheeks, especially when they smile. Some people may only have one dimple on only one side of the face."
Duchenne smile.
"Although there are many different types of smiles, researchers are interested in the duchenne smile because it is done with the eyes. The Duchenne smile was named after the French physician Guillaume Duchenne. Duchenne identified two types of smiles. A Duchenne smile is when the cheek raises and forms a wrinkle around the eyes. Many researchers think that Duchenne smiles are usually hard to make when you are pretending to smile."
Internet.
"On the Internet, smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a smiley, smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is."
"Western Style: :-), :-(, ;-), :-O, :-D, (;D)"
"Eastern Style: d(^.^)b, \(^o^)/, &gt;.&lt;, ^_^, *&lt;):)"
A manicure is the act of beautifying one's hands or fingernails. Manicures can be done at home or by a professional in a nail salon.
"During a manicure, the nail is filed with a nail file; the free edge of the nail is cut, the cuticle is treated, the person's hand is massaged and nail polish is put on."
History.
"5000 years ago, manicures were first used. Henna was used in India for manicure. The word mehendi, another word for henna, derives from the Sanskrit mehandika. Cixi, the Dowager Empress of China, had very long naturally-grown nails."
Dietitian
A dietitian or dietician is an expert in food and nutrition.
Dietitians help promote good health through proper eating. They often write custom diets for people.
In a medical setting they can give food supplements for those people who cannot get what they need because of swallowing problems.
"Dietitians want to find, cook and serve tasty, attractive and healthy food to patients, their families and healthcare providers."
In many countries only people with specific degrees or certifications can call themselves dietitians.
"The term nutritionist is widely used as it is not controlled like the title dietitian, but the word nutritionist can be used without having the qualifications of registered dietitians."
A nutritionist is not a dietitian as he is not registered to a national board and does not have the same qualifications.
"Dietitians are important in the medical multidisciplinary team because they are experts in nutrition and can give advice to doctors, nurses, and other health care workers."
"Dietitians supervise the preparation and service of food, help in research, and teach people on how to eat well."
Mycology
"Mycology is the study of fungi. This includes their genetics, their biochemical properties (the chemical processes in them), their classification, their use to humans and their dangers (poisonous or infectious). Fungi are a source of tinder (easily combustible material to light fires), medicines, food, and psychoactive substances."
A biologist who studies mycology is called a mycologist.
"Mycology is closely related to phytopathology (the study of plant diseases), because most plant diseases are caused by fungi."
"Historically, mycology was a branch of botany (plant biology). Now fungi are thought to be more closely related to animals than to plants."
"Fungi are fundamental (perhaps essential) for life on Earth. They are symbionts. They can break down complex organic biomolecules, and so they are a link in the global carbon cycle."
Andoni Iraola
Andoni Iraola (born 22 June 1982) is a Spanish football player. He plays for Athletic Bilbao and Spain national team.

Appetite for Destruction
"Appetite for Destruction is the first studio album by American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. It was released on July 21, 1987, through Geffen Records."
"When the album as released in 1987, it was not popular. Next year, in 1988, it became very successful after the band had toured and radio stations played the singles ""Welcome to the Jungle"", ""Paradise City"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"". It was first on ""Billboard"" 200 and became the best-selling debut album of all time, as well as the eleventh best-selling album of all time in the United States. With more than 30 million copies sold worldwide, it is also one of the best-selling records of all time."
"Although critics at first had mixed feelings toward the album, ""Appetite for Destruction"" is now liked by critics and is considered as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2018, it was re-released as a remastered box set with critics liking it too."
Background.
"Guns N' Roses first recordings were for a planned EP in March 1985, shortly after forming, with ""Don't Cry"", a cover of ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Think About You"" and ""Anything Goes"". However, the EP did not happen, as original guitarist Tracii Guns left the band, being replaced by Slash. Shortly afterward, a new lineup of Axl Rose, Duff McKagan, Slash, Steven Adler and Izzy Stradlin was confirmed. This is the classic lineup for the band."
"After playing many shows in Los Angeles clubs, the group signed with Geffen Records in March 1986. In December 1986, the group released the four-song EP ""Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide"", which was made to keep people interested in the band while it started work in the studio. The label also thought the band didn't have enough songs, so they made the EP."
"Singer Axl Rose said that many of the songs on the album were written while the band was performing on the Los Angeles club circuit, and a number of songs that would be featured on later Guns N' Roses albums were considered for ""Appetite for Destruction"", such as ""Back Off Bitch"", ""You Could Be Mine"", ""November Rain"" and ""Don't Cry"". ""November Rain"" was not put on the album because ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" is already on it. They only wanted one ballad."
"Producer Spencer Proffer was hired to record ""Nightrain"" and ""Sweet Child o' Mine"" to test if he could work with the band. They eventually recorded nine songs during these sessions, including ""Heartbreak Hotel"", ""Don't Cry"", ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and ""Shadow of Your Love"". In mid to late 1986, the band recorded demos with Nazareth guitarist Manny Charlton, which were released in 2018. (See Below for more info)"
"The band at first considered Paul Stanley of KISS to produce, but he was rejected after he wanted to change Adler's drum set more than Adler wanted. Robert John ""Mutt"" Lange was also considered, but the label didn't want to spend the extra money on a famous producer. Ultimately, Mike Clink (who had produced several Triumph records) was chosen, and the group recorded ""Shadow of Your Love"" first with Clink as a test."
"In 1999, Rose re-recorded the album with the lineup at the time (Rose, Robin Finck, Tommy Stinson, Paul Tobias, Josh Freese, Dizzy Reed &amp; Chris Pitman) to ""spruce up"" the album with new recording techniques. The re-recorded version of the album was never released, although an edited clip of ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" featuring the second half of the song using the re-recorded version was included over the credits of the movie ""Big Daddy"" in 1999."
Track listing.
Super deluxe edition.
"The ""Locked N' Loaded"" Edition and the ""Super Deluxe Edition"" have the same musical contents. Disc one is the original album."

Capital gains tax
"A capital gains tax (CGT) is a tax on the profit realized on the sale of a non-inventory asset. The most common capital gains are seen from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, and property."
"Not all countries have a capital gains tax and most have different rates of taxation. Countries that do not impose a capital gains tax include Bahrain, Barbados, Belize, Cayman Islands, Isle of Man, Jamaica, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and others."
"In some countries, such as New Zealand and Singapore, professional traders and those who trade frequently are taxed on such profits as a business income."
Women in the history of Manipur kingdom
"Manipuri women have been known for their valor, skill and active involvement in social, economic, political and cultural activities, besides holding almost all the household responsibilities as a mother, wife, daughter, sister and daughter in law."
"Thomas Callan Hodson, the then British Political Agent of 1908 Manipur, quoted in his monograph, The Meitheis, as follows:"
&lt;poem&gt;
"""The women hold a high and free position in Manipur, all the integral trade and exchange of the produce of the country being managed by them. The habit of the country is to have bazars (markets) at convenient spots by the road side, where a handful of women congregate at the early hour...!"""
&lt;/poem&gt;
List.
Leima Linthoingambi.
"Leima Linthoingambi was the queen of king Ningthoukhomba (1432-1567) of Manipur. During the invasion of the Ankla tribes, the king had to proceed at the war field. At the King's absence in the capital city, the Tangkhul tribes raided the city. But in disguise as the king, the queen resisted their revolution by offering strong wine at the king's absence. With her wits, the kingdom was saved. This account is recorded in the Ningthourol Lambuba."
Kuranganayani.
"Kuranganayani, originally known as Shija Phongalokpi, is the biological daughter of King Gaurishyam and the adoptive daughter of King Bhagyachandra. She was offered hand in marriage to the Ahom king to strengthen the relationship between the two kingdoms as well as to get military aid from the Ahoms for the Meiteis to resist the Burmese conquest of Manipur. But she turned out to be a heroine even in the Ahom kingdom. It was she who saved the Ahom kingdom from the hands of the Moamoriya revolts."
Yairipok Thambalnu.
"Thambalnu was a lady from a poor family in Yairipok town of Manipur. But her beauty and charm causes conflicts among many able men in the kingdom in her times. During flood times from the Imphal river in the kingdom, the Royal Oracle proclaimed that the water god Wangbren will be pleased if a young girl is offered to Him. Since Thambalnu became a problem for numerous men, she was chosen to be offered to the deity. So, she was forcibly (or voluntarily) put in sacrifice to the strong river flow. After her death, the flood was also gone."
Maharani Kumudini.
"Queen Kumudini was widowed when her son was at a ripe age. She devised many diplomatic relations and plots to protect the throne from the other family members of the royalty. When her son, Chandrakirti became the king, she was known as a popular feminine icon in the kingdom."
"Waitangi, Northland"

Waitangi Day
"Waitangi Day (), the national day of New Zealand, celebrates the anniversary of the initial signing – on 6 February 1840 – of the Treaty of Waitangi, which is seen as the founding document of the nation. The first Waitangi Day was not celebrated until 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974."
"Much later, in the 19th century (1800s), Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They were the first to have the idea of Vikings wearing helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera ""Ring des Nibelungen"" so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings."
History.
"During the 10th through 13th centuries, when the Christian religion spread through Scandiavia, modern countries started to form there. They came together into three kingdoms:"
"These three Scandinavian kingdoms made the Kalmar Union in 1387 under Queen Margaret I of Denmark. However, in 1523, Sweden left the union. Because of this, civil war broke out in Denmark and Norway. Then, the Protestant Reformation happened, and Catholic and Protestant Christians fought each other. After things settled, the Norwegian Privy Council was abolished: it assembled for the last time in 1537. Denmark and Norway formed another union in 1536, and it lasted until 1814. It turned into the three modern countries Denmark, Norway and Iceland."
"The borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway came to the shape they have today in the middle of the seventeenth century: In the 1645 Treaty of Brömsebro, Denmark–Norway gave some territory to Sweden: the Norwegian provinces of Jämtland, Härjedalen and Idre &amp; Särna and the Baltic Sea islands of Gotland and Ösel (in Estonia). The 1658 Treaty of Roskilde forced Denmark–Norway to give the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge, Halland, Bornholm, and the Norwegian provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag to Sweden. In 1660, the Treaty of Copenhagen forced Sweden to give Bornholm and Trøndelag back to Denmark–Norway."
"Finland used to be part of Sweden in medieval times. During the wars fought by Napoleon, it became part of Russia."
Minerva (automobile)
"In 1883 a young Belgian called Sylvain de Jong settled in Antwerp, Belgium. He started a bicycle factory there. By the end of that century he started producing motorbikes, and after a while automobiles as well. In 1903 he grounded the NV Minerva Motors' in Berchem (Antwerp)."
"A certain Charles S Rolls was Minerva dealer in England. The small 1 cylinder ""Minervette"" was there with its 105 Pound, the cheapest automobile."
"In the years after the fame of the automobile was rising enormous. Most important market for the constructor remained however England that took the biggest part of the production, followed by the Netherlands and France."
"From 1908 Minerva got a worldwide Knight licence. The Knight motor was a motor without valves, developed by Charles Y Knight in the United States. These motors were extremely silent. The company did well in several automobile racing competitions in Europe."
"After worldwar I, during which Sylvain de Jong and his engineers headed to Amsterdam, where they kept on developing parts, they returned to start up the production of luxury automobiles. The constructors star rose in the United States as well, American filmstars, politicians and industrials liked them cars as well (even Henry Ford had before the WW already one!). The car had the same qualities as the Rolls Royce, but was a little cheaper. With the economical crisis in the 30's, the company went bankrupt in 1936. The remains were taken over by another Belgian constructor named Imperia. Imperia putted the name Minerva on their automobiles for export to England and France and for the trucks (which Minerva had made before too)."
After worldwar II the company produced Land Rovers under licence for the Belgian army. Production of these 4Wheel Drives stopped in 1953. The company struggled for survival and made some Land Rover-like cars till 1956. But than the constructor diappeared completely.

The Grange Road campus is now the MOE Teacher's Network."
Archipelago
"An archipelago () is a chain or group of islands. The word ""archipelago"" means ""chief sea"", from Greek ""arkhon"" (""arkhi""-) (""leader"") and ""pelagos"" (""sea"")."
"Archipelagos are usually found in the open sea; less commonly, a big landmass may neighbor them, an example being Scotland which has more than 700 islands surrounding the mainland. Many archipelagos are volcanic, forming along mid-ocean ridges or hotspots. Others are island arcs neighboring an oceanic trench. Many other processes create archipelagos, including erosion, deposition, and land elevation."
"The four biggest countries that are mainly archipelagos are Japan, the Philippines, the United Kingdom and Indonesia (the world's biggest country that is an archipelago, according to the CIA World Factbook). The biggest archipelago in the world by size is in Northern Canada, the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which is in the Arctic Ocean."
"The Amalie Arena is an arena in Tampa, Florida, that has been used for ice hockey, basketball, and arena football games, as well as concerts."
It is home to the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League and the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League.
The area has previously been called The Ice Palace (19996-2011) and Tampa Bay Times Forum (2012-2014).
History.
"The arena, in Downtown Tampa's Channelside District was a secondary location chosen after the failure of Tampa Coliseum Inc. to secure funding to construct an arena on Tampa Sports Authority land near Tampa Stadium. It opened in 1996 as the Ice Palace. Its first event was a performance by the Royal Hanneford Circus. The first hockey game was the Lightning hosting the New York Rangers, which the Lightning won by a score of 5–2."
"The arena was built as a new home for the Lightning after the club outgrew the older, smaller Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds. Prior to the opening of the Ice Palace, the Lightning moved to the Florida Suncoast Dome, which was nicknamed the ""Thunderdome,"" in St. Petersburg, Florida, joining the Tampa Bay Storm, in 1994. Upon the completion of the Ice Palace, both the Lightning and the Storm, moved in. The Thunderdome, now named Tropicana Field, is currently home to Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays."
Control of the venue has changed hands three times since the building's opening in 1996. The lease agreement ties the arena to the ownership of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
"Naming rights to the Ice Palace were sold to the ""St. Petersburg Times"", a daily newspaper sold throughout the Tampa Bay Area. In January 2012, the arena name changed to Tampa Bay Times Forum once the newspaper renamed itself the ""Tampa Bay Times""."
"On September 3, 2014, Tampa Bay Lightning owner Jeff Vinik announced that the arena would be renamed Amalie Arena after they came to an agreement with Amalie Oil Company, an oil company based in Tampa. Other entertainment events occasionally held in the Arena include concerts, NBA games, USF Basketball and NCAA Tournament games, tennis, professional wrestling, boxing, figure skating, and rodeos (as well as stand-alone bull riding events; the Arena has hosted an event by the PBR's premier tour, the Bud Light Cup (renamed Built Ford Tough Series in 2003), annually since 1998.)"
Notable events.
"The building hosted the 1999 NHL All-Star Game, World Wrestling Federation ""Survivor Series 2000"", and games of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in 2003, 2008 and 2011. The Arena hosted 4 of the 7 games during the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, as the Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames 4 games to 3 to win their first Stanley Cup. The Arena also hosted ArenaBowl XII (1998) and ArenaBowl XVII (2003) and the 2007 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament."
"The Arena hosted the 2008 NCAA Women's Division I Final Four Basketball Tournament on April 6–8. Tennessee beat Stanford, 64-48. In 2009, the Arena hosted the Southeastern Conference Men's Basketball Tournament."
"In 2009, Britney Spears performed at the Arena for her ""The Circus Starring Britney Spears"" tour. The show is also notable for a wardrobe malfunction and the remark, ""Okay, my pussy is hanging out of this fucking --"", after she performed ""I'm a Slave 4 U"" and didn't realize that her mic was still on. The incident later received notable attention and has received thousands of views on YouTube."
"In 2012, Amalie Arena hosted the NCAA Men's Hockey Frozen Four championship finals; this was the first time the ""Frozen Four"" was held outside the northern US since 1999, when the University of Alaska Anchorage hosted the event at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim, now the Honda Center, in Anaheim, California. The Frozen Four was hosted by the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the nearest NCAA hockey team to Florida."
"WWE Raw and WWE SmackDown has been held at the arena numerous times. WWE held their three-hour event inside of the Arena where Raw hosted their 800th episode celebration on November 3, 2008. WWE returned to the Arena once again for the December 21st edition of Raw where former New York Yankees and current Tampa Bay Rays player Johnny Damon served as the Guest Host at the time he was a free agent. For the first time in three years, SmackDown returned to Amalie Arena for the June 8, 2010 edition."
"Tampa also hosted WWE Extreme Rules on May 1, 2011; it was the arena's first WWE PPV since Survivor Series 2000 in 11 years as it was originally scheduled to take place at the Amway Center in Orlando."
Amalie Arena hosted the 2012 Republican National Convention.
Piedmont blues
"Piedmont blues (also called East Coast Blues) is a blues music style from the East Coast of the USA. The name came from the Piedmont, a hilly coastal area between Richmond, Virginia and Atlanta, Georgia. But the style is also played in Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Florida."
"The main instruments are guitar, vocals, drums and bass. The Piedmont style is played on acoustic instruments. The main difference to the Delta blues is the ragtime based rhythm. The style is influenced by ragtime, country string bands, traveling medicine shows and popular song of the early 20th century. East Coast Piedmont Blues blended both black and white, rural and urban song elements in the diverse urban centers of the Southeast and mid-Atlantic region. In contrast to Delta blues, the Piedmont blues were influenced by white music."
"In the early twentieth century artists such as Blind Boy Fuller, Blind Blake, Blind Willie McTell, Rev. Gary Davis and Sonny Terry made Piedmont blues popular. Women also played the Piedmont guitar style, including Etta Baker and Elizabeth Cotten, whose “Freight Train” is one of the most recognized Piedmont tunes. Before the Second World War Piedmont blues was a style that was very popular with the African-Americans of the South. The heyday was the 1920s and 1930s."
Sportverein Austria Salzburg
The Sportverein Austria Salzburg (shortly SV Austria Salzburg) is an Austrian footballclub based in Salzburg. The club was founded in 2005 after the Red Bull takover of the old Austria Salzburg.
History.
The club was founded in September 2005 after the Red Bull takover of the 1933 founded club SV Austria Salzburg. Due to differences about the new club supporters left the now socalled FC Red Bull Salzburg and founded SV Austria Salzburg. Role models were the fanbiased English clubs AFC Wimbledon and FC United of Manchester. The club claims to preserve the tradition of SV Austria Salzburg.
"The season 2005/06 they played together with PSV Schwarz-Weiß in the Salzburger Landesliga (4th class) but at the end of the season the cooperation ended. The club has to start in the 7. class of Austrian football. The first match of the new SV Austria Salzburg was played on 29 July 2006 against ""Lieferinger SV"", another football club from the city of Salzburg. SV Austria Salzburg won 6–0.But the following seasons they won the classes they played in so they play the season 2010/11 in the Regionalliga West, which is the 3rd class of Austrian league system."
"In the 2014–15 season the club was promoted to the First League, the second tier of Austrian football. The promotion to the First League forced the club into debt of €900,000 by November 2015. It was caused by an increased budget for the players and a security requirement In November 2015 they were fined €40,000 and had 6 points deducted. This was due to their failure to adhere to the league's stadium requirements. The same year they were relegated."
Now Austria Salzburg is playing in the Regionalliga Salzburg (3rd level).

"On 22 April 1834, the island of St Helena became a colony of the British crown."
"A local industry using the fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully reestablished in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War. However, the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres and the last flax industry closed in 1965."
"In 1922, the Ascension then was attached as a dependency followed by the Tristan da Cunha Island 12 January 1938."
1981 to present.
"In 1981, the British governmente changed the status of Saint Helena and the other Crown colonies to ""British Dependent Territories""."
"In 2009, Saint Helena and its two territories received equal status under a new constitution, and the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha."
"Geography, plants and animals."
"The island of Saint Helena has a total area of . The centre is covered by forest, of which some has been planted. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena Plover or Wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the islets near the coast."
"The highest point of the island is Diana's Peak () at . In 1996 it became the island's first national park. In 2000 a project began to replant part of the lost Great Wood, called the Millennium Forest, and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust, established in 2002."
"There are several rocks and islets off the coast, including: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson's Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady's Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast), all of which are within one kilometre of the shore."
"The national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena Plover, known locally as the Wirebird. It appears on the coat of arms of Saint Helena and on the flag."
Climate.
"The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by trade winds that blow almost continuously."
Administrative divisions.
"Saint Helena is divided into eight districts. People that works and lives in the Jamestown Harbour and in the Royal Mail Ship ""St. Helena"" (RMS) are included in the census in their work places (see reference)."
Economy.
"The island had an economy of only one crop until 1966, based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string. St Helena's economy is now weak, and is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government."
The tourist industry is heavily based on the presence of Napoleon in the island.
"Saint Helena produces what is said to be the most expensive coffee in the world. It also produces and exports ""Tungi Spirit"", made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears, ""Opuntia ficus-indica"" (""Tungi"" is the local St Helenian name for the plant). Ascension Island, Tristan da Cunha and Saint Helena all issue their own postage stamps which provide a significant income."
Banking and currency.
"Saint Helena has its own currency, the Saint Helena pound, which is at parity with the pound sterling. The government of Saint Helena produces coins and banknotes. The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena, and in Georgetown, Ascension Island."
Helicopter
A helicopter (also often used: chopper or heli) is a kind of flying machine or aircraft. A helicopter lifts up off
"of the ground and moves because of its rotors. A rotor is several small wings, called rotor blades, that spin together around a shaft. For that reason, helicopters are sometimes called ""rotary-wing aircraft"". A helicopter flies differently from an airplane. An airplane must move forward to stay in the air, but because the helicopter's rotor blades are always moving, the helicopter can stop and stay in one place above the ground. Not needing a runway, they can land in places where an airplane cannot. Helicopters can move by tilting their rotor blades, which causes the aircraft to fly in the direction the blades are tilted."
History.
"Since around 400 BC, the Chinese had a flying top that was used as a children's toy. The flying top was made from bamboo and used the same method of spinning wings to fly up in the air. Later flying tops were made of feathers tied to a stick. Leonardo da Vinci first thought of a helicopter flown by a man in 1490, and drew pictures of his ideas. It was hundreds of years later (in the early 20th century) before anyone built one that could really fly. The first practical helicopters were built by Frenchman Louis Breguet in 1935 and by German Henrich Focke in 1936. A Russian immigrant, Igor Sikorsky, built and perfected the first practical helicopter in America in 1939."
Uses.
"Helicopters are especially useful when there are disasters when infrastructure is damaged. Food packets, water, medicines and clothes are dropped from the air to people on the ground who cannot be reached by road. When people are injured, helicopters can carry them to hospitals faster than an ambulance on the road."
"Helicopters are also used by the military, because they can move troops and equipment to places an airplane cannot take them. Attack helicopters act as attack aircraft carrying and shooting guns and missiles."
Training helicopter is used for learning how to be a helicopter pilot.
"After privatisation, NSE was divided up into several franchises:"
SR Class 4Lav
The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 4Lav to the electric multiple units built to work the semi-fast services on the route between London and Brighton. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class.
SR Class 6Pul
"The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designations 6Pul, 6Cit and 6Pan to electric multiple units built to work the routes between London and Brighton, West Worthing and Eastbourne. None of these units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated a TOPS class number. The 6Pul units were designated 6Cor until 1935 (the Cor designation was later used for 4Cor units)."
British Rail Mark 3
"British Rail's third fundamental design of carriage was designated Mark 3, and was introduced in 1976 primarily for use on the High Speed Train (HST). The coaches were also used as conventional loco-hauled stock as part of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) northern electrification scheme in the mid 1970s, designated Mark 3A and 3B. The final batch was built in 1988, but Mark 3-based multiple units continued to be built until the early 1990s."
Desiro
Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.
"The Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort."
Austria.
"In Austria, the ÖBB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called ""ÖBB 5022"". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff."
Bulgaria.
"In 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a €67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another €117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BDŽ and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas."
Denmark.
"In Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains."
Germany.
"Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120 km/h, these ""Class 642"" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs."
"The ""Class 642"" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315 kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the ""Müglitzbahn"", have made greater passenger numbers."
"At first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the ""Class 642"" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the ""Class 643""."
Hungary.
"Right now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with MÁV (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and Sátoraljaújhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton."
Malaysia.
The 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia.
These EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160 km/h.
Romania.
"Căile Ferate Române (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: """"Regio"", ""InterRegio"" and ""InterCity"" inter-city services, but mostly on its ""InterRegio"""" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes."
Russia.
"Megan Mullally revealed that she was originally doing a voice in the film. According to Mullally, the producers were dissatisfied to learn that the voice of her character Karen Walker on the television show ""Will &amp; Grace"" was not her natural speaking voice. The producers hired her anyway, and then strongly encouraged her to use her Karen Walker voice for the role. When Mullally refused, she was dismissed."
"The film was dedicated to Glenn McQueen, a Pixar animator who died of melanoma in October 2002."
"Finding Nemo shares many plot elements with ""Pierrot the Clownfish"", a children's book published in 2002, but allegedly conceived in 1995. The author, Franck Le Calvez, sued Disney for infringement of his intellectual rights. The judge ruled against him, citing the color differences between Pierrot and Nemo."
"To ensure that the movements of the fish in the film were believable the animators essentially took a crash course in fish biology and oceanography. They visited aquariums, went diving in Hawaii and received in-house lectures from an ichthyologist."
Box office.
"""Finding Nemo"" earned $380,673,009 in North America, and $540,900,000 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $921,573,009. It is the second highest-grossing film of 2003, behind '.

It was the most recently released film among all ten lists, and one of only three movies made after the year 2000, the others being """" and ""Shrek""."
Video game.
"A video game based on the film was released in 2003, for PC, Xbox, PS2, GameCube and GBA."
Sequel.
"In 2005, after disagreements between Disney's Michael Eisner and Pixar's Steve Jobs over the distribution of Pixar's films, Disney announced that they would be creating a new animation studio, Circle 7 Animation, to make sequels to the seven Disney-owned Pixar films (which consisted of the films released between 1995 and 2011). The studio had put ""Toy Story 4"" and ""Monsters at Work"" in development, and had also hired screenwriter Laurie Craig to write a draft for ""Finding Nemo 2"". Circle 7 was subsequently shut down after Robert Iger replaced Eisner as CEO of Disney and arranged the acquisition of Pixar."
"In July 2012, it was reported that Andrew Stanton is developing a sequel to ""Finding Nemo"", with Victoria Strouse writing the script and a schedule to be released in 2016. However, the same day the news of a potential sequel broke, director Andrew Stanton posted a message on his personal Twitter calling into question the accuracy of these reports. The message said, ""Didn't you all really learn from ""Toy Story 4""? Everyone calm down. Don't believe everything you read. Nothing to see here now. #skyisnotfalling"" According to the report by Hollywood Reporter published in August 2012, Ellen DeGeneres is in negotiations to reprise her role of Dory. In September 2012, it was confirmed by Stanton saying: ""What was immediately on the list was writing a second ""Carter"" movie. When that went away, everything slid up. I know I'll be accused by more sarcastic people that it's a reaction to ""Carter"" not doing well, but only in its timing, but not in its conceit."""
Fibonacci
"Fibonacci, also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo Fibonacci and Leonardo of Pisa, lived c. 11701250. He was an Italian mathematician. He was thought ""the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages""."
"Fibonacci popularized the Hindu–Arabic numeral system to the Western World. He did this in his composition in 1202 of ""Liber Abaci"" (""Book of Calculation""). He also introduced to Europe the sequence of Fibonacci numbers which he used as an example in ""Liber Abaci""."
Fibonacci number sequence.
"Fibonacci is best known for the list of numbers called the Fibonacci Sequence. The list never stops, but it starts this way:"
"1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233,"
"377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584..."
"In this list, a person can find the next number by adding the last two numbers together."
1 + 1 = 2
1 + 2 = 3
2 + 3 = 5
"Stauber first published on YouTube in 2013. His website was launched in late 2017. The website mostly has links to other content such as his social media and merch stores. Stauber also has a Patreon, where he releases unreleased songs and videos monthly. He also releases full versions of short songs found on his YouTube channel. These full versions are usually released later under ""Jack Stauber's Micropop""."
Early life.
"Stauber grew up in McKean, Pennsylvania. He has one sister, named Kharly. He majored in marketing and minored in studio arts at the University of Pittsburgh. In an interview, Stauber showed his favorite cartoon is Rugrats, and liked the art style, stating ""Take some time to watch a minute of the pilot of Rugrats if you haven’t seen that before. The art style is beyond incredible."""
Work.
"""Buttercup"" and ""Oh Klahoma""."
"Stauber's most famous work, ""Buttercup"", is the first song released on his 2017 album ""Pop Food"". The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular internet meme, especially on TikTok, which helped with its success. The song currently has 279 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for it. The song has been described as ""bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals."" YouTuber ""lisuga"" made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese film, ""Kick-Heart"". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 191 million views as of May 2021."
"""Oh Klahoma"", the second track from ""Pop Food"", also became popular. The song currently has 74 million Spotify streams as of May 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories. However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like KKK robes."
Style.
"Stauber's visual style is known to be different, with some YouTube videos being dedicated to attempting to replicate the aesthetic that he utilizes in many of his videos. Stauber himself commented under one such video, expressing that he was impressed with the result. Meg Fair of ""Pittsburgh City Paper"" highlighted Stauber's knack of ""pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music"" and liked his ability to switch styles quickly. Jenna Minnig of ""PennState CommMedia"" compared Stauber's music to Ariel Pink's; as both have hypnagogic-pop styles and have similar voices, but believed it was not needed to compare the two. Fans of his music include American rock musician Jon Bon Jovi, actor, rapper, and comedian Andy Milonakis, actor Verne Troyer, indie singer-songwriter Sidney Gish, and model Paris Jackson."
Animations.
"Along with music, Stauber is known for his animations. They are usually separated into three styles: ""surreal"", characters with odd and striking facial expressions and frequently part of his claymations, ""colorful"", which usually are featured in his VHS animations and music videos, and ""Stauber faces"", light-skinned characters with cartoon noses. Stauber is also well known for his frequent use of teeth in his videos and animations. He usually uses detailed resin teeth on his clay characters, although he has used real teeth. He has encouraged fans to send him teeth for him to use in his videos."

Katsuyama Castle Museum
"Katsuyama Castle Museum (勝山城博物館, ""Katsuyama-jō Hakubutsukan"") is a museum that is in the city of Katsuyama in Fukui Prefecture in Japan. The museum was finished on July 19, 1992. It is considered to be the tallest castle in Japan, at 57.8 meters, but it is not a castle because it does not have a ""tenshu"" or ""tenshukaku""–a “keep tower” (tower to defend from enemies). It was built to look like the Himeji castle. The museum also stands out because it has dragons cut into its foundation stone, which is unusual for a Japanese castle."
History behind the construction.
"During the Edo period in Japan, the territory of modern Katsuyama City belonged to the Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (region). During that time, the city was planning to build a ""tenshu"". However, for different reasons, such as the laws that were in place at that time, the city was never able to finish it. Kiyoshi Tada, who was born in Katsuyama and who was the founder of Sōgōtakushi, a taxi company that is nowadays divided into many different taxi companies, decided to build a castle, and put into life the long wish of people for a ""tenshu"". Instead of a usual castle he built a museum that looks like a castle, where different items from his own collection are displayed nowadays, including various samurai armor, swords, and traditional folding screens. The museum was built close to another gift to Katsuyama from Kiyoshi Tada--""Echizen Daibutsu"", a complex of buildings built in a traditional Japanese style with a huge Buddha statue in it. The cost of construction was 10 billion yen."
Modern times.
"Since the opening, the museum has been managed by the Tada Kiyoshi Cultural Educational Commemoration Foundation (""多田清文化教育記念財団"", ""Tada Kiyoshi Bunka Kyōiku Kinen Zaidan""). In 2014, the Katsuyama Castle Museum started working together with the Katsuyama City government."
"In addition to Kiyoshi Tada’s own collection, the museum also displays a collection of more than 800 articles of embroidery of the Qing dynasty in China. There is also a collection of works by famous calligrapher Goseki Nishiwaki shown in the museum."
"Many events are held on the museum territory throughout the year, including tea ceremonies, haiku competitions, various concerts, and collaborations with the government and other museums. (Please check the information before visiting there as the event may be canceled or changed due to the influence of the coronavirus."
"In 2019 alone 12,5000 people visited either the museum and/or the ""Echizen Daibutsu""."
You can overlook the city of Katsuyama from the observation room on the top floor.
We can get to the museum for about 15 minutes from Katsuyama station by bus. This museum closed on Wednesday and open from 9:30 to 16:30 except Wednesday.

The service operates in 644 cities in the United States and 12 cities in Canada.
Lyft started in the summer of 2012.
Ucanha
"Ucanha is a place in northern Yucatán, Mexico, where scientists dig up Mayan ruins. It used to be a town where Mayans lived. People lived in Ucanha during the Late Preclassic period (ca. 300 B.C. — ca. A.D. 250). It was about 2.2 square kilometers in size. There were about 400 households. It was connected to a larger town, Uci, by a wide stone causeway. Uci is 13 km to the west of Ucanha."
"A large brightly colored stucco mask was discovered in Ucanha in 2017. It is about two meters tall and was found in a building near the center of Ucanha. Although masks like this one have been found in other Maya sites, this is the only one known for this part of Mexico."
The mask has been repaired so it looks the way it did when it was new. The archaeologists buried the mask again to preserve it and because the site is not legally protected.
Insemination
"For organisms that reproduce sexually, insemination is the transfer of male gametes (usually sperm) into the female reproductive tract, for the purpose of generating offspring. In mammals, this is the uterus, in birds, this is the oviduct. Insemination happens naturally during sexual intercourse, or copulation. It can also be done artificially, in which case it is called artificial insemination."
"Carter said that the liberal part of the Democratic Party did not support his policies the most. He said they were caused by Senator Ted Kennedy's plan to replace him as president. Kennedy announced his plans to run for president in November 1979. Kennedy did not run a good campaign and Carter won most of the primaries. Carter won the Democratic re-nomination, however, Kennedy gave Carter weak support from the Liberal Democrats in the general election. Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale were nominated at the Democratic National Convention in New York City."
General election.
"Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was not easy as he ran against Republican Ronald Reagan. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, left the campaign five weeks before the election because of possible cocaine use. On October 28, Carter and Reagan had the only presidential debate of the election. Reagan was losing to Carter at first, but after the debates, Reagan became popular."
"Carter lost his re-election to Reagan in a landslide victory. Reagan won 489 of the electoral votes and Carter won 49. After the election, Carter said that he was hurt by the outcome of the election."
Post-presidency.
"Shortly after losing his re-election bid, Carter told the White House press corps that he wanted his retirement to be similar than that of Harry S. Truman and not use his public life to make himself rich. In October 1986, his presidential library was opened in Atlanta, Georgia."
"Carter built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, and partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities."
"Carter went to the opening ceremonies of his presidential library and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. He gave eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King Gerald Ford, Theodore Hesburgh, and John Lewis.

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire is the short title of an important book by the 18th century English historian Edward Gibbon. The book traces the Roman Empire—and Western civilization as a whole—from the late first century AD to the fall of the Eastern or Byzantine Empire.
"Published in six volumes, from volume I in 1776 to volumes IV, V, VI in 1788–89. The work covers the history of the Roman Empire, Europe, and the Catholic Church from 98 to 1590 AD, and discusses the decline of the Roman Empire in the East and its fall in the West. Because of its relative objectivity and heavy use of primary sources, its methodology became a model for later historians. This led to Gibbon being called the first ""modern historian of ancient Rome""."
Thesis.
Gibbon gave an explanation for why the Roman Empire fell.
"According to Gibbon, the Roman Empire succumbed to barbarian invasions because its citizens gradually lost their ""civic virtue"". They had become weak, using barbarian mercenaries to defend their Empire, who then became so numerous that they were able to take over the Empire."
"Romans, he believed, became unwilling to live the tougher, ""manly"" military lifestyle. In addition, Gibbon argued that Christianity created a belief that a better life existed after death. This fostered an indifference to the present among Roman citizens, and sapped their desire to sacrifice for the Empire. He also believed its pacifism tended to hamper the traditional Roman martial spirit. Finally, like other Enlightenment thinkers, Gibbon held in contempt the Middle Ages as a priest-ridden, superstitious, ""dark age"". It was not until his own age of reason and rational thought, so it was believed, that human history could resume its progress."
"Gibbon sees the Praetorian Guard as the main catalyst of the empire's initial decay and eventual collapse, a seed planted by Augustus at the start of the empire. He cites repeated examples of the Praetorian Guard abusing their power with calamitous results, including numerous instances of imperial assassination and incessant demands for increased pay."
Views on Christianity.
"In Volume I, especially Chapters XV and XVI, Gibbon challenged Church history. He estimated far smaller numbers of Christian martyrs than had been previously thought. The Church's version of its early history had rarely been questioned before. For Gibbon, however, the Church writings were secondary sources. He shunned them in favour of primary sources from the period he was writing about. This is one reason why Gibbon is referred to as the ""first modern historian""."
Gibbon's main theory was that Christianity as a prime factor in the Empire's decline and fall.
"And, more generally:"
"Later historians have mostly not agreed with Gibbon. Today, historians tend to analyze economic and military factors in the decline of Rome."
Editions.
Gibbon continued to revise and change his work even after publication. The complexities of the problem are addressed in Womersley's introduction and appendices to his complete edition.

Rocket engine
"A rocket engine is a device that produces a force by pushing gases at high speed out of a nozzle. Rocket engines burn chemicals such as petroleum and liquid oxygen at very high pressures and temperatures to turn the chemical energy into motion. In some cases (such as NASA rockets), the force created can be over ."
A garden hose shows how moving fluid can create a force. When a hose is turned up the hose will snake around unless it is held still. The exiting water is creating a force on the hose just like how the rocket engine gases push on the rocket engine.
"Liquids, solids and hybrids."
"Some rocket engines burn liquid fuels while some burn solid fuels. Solid fuel rocket engines are sometimes called ""rocket motors""."
"Liquid fuel rocket engines often require complex pumps and valves to properly move (and pressurize) the liquids from the fuel tank to the actual engine. These machines must work in extreme temperatures and pressures. Liquid oxygen is very cold (-223˚C) while the engine is very hot (3000˚C), and the pressure is oftentimes hundreds of times higher than normal air pressure. Because of these conditions, liquid fuel rocket engines are often very complex and require very specialised materials (metals, ceramics, etc.)."
"Solid fuel rocket motors have the fuel (called propellant) as a solid mixture of an oxidizer and fuel. An oxidizer supports the burning of fuel much like oxygen supports burning. The common oxidizer is powdered Ammonium Perchlorate, while the common fuel is powdered aluminum metal. The two powders are stuck together with a third component known as the binder. The binder is a rubbery solid that also burns as a fuel. The simple idea makes solid rocket engines cheaper, but they cannot be turned off or controlled, and are more likely to explode than liquid rocket engines. Solid rockets also provide a smaller specific impulse, hence must be heavier to launch the same payload."
"Military missiles commonly use solid rockets because they can be kept ready for many years. Many satellite launchers use solid rocket boosters when they start, but liquid rockets for the majority of the flight."
"Hybrid rocket engines combine the two ideas. The two propellants are different states of matter, often with liquid oxidisers and solid fuels. They are not used much, but might be safer than solid rocket motors or liquid rocket motors"
Nozzle
A nozzle is a device that takes incoming fluid (such as gas or liquid) and increases the speed. This is done by changing the size of the pipe (or tube) that the fluid is flowing through.

Penny Black
"The Penny Black was the world's first adhesive postage stamp. It was issued by the United Kingdom on the 1 May 1840 and used from the 6 May the same year. All London post offices received official issues of the new stamps, but other offices in the country did not. Some post offices like in Bath, offered the stamp unofficially after 2 May."
Spenserian stanza
"The Spenserian stanza is a fixed verse form invented by Edmund Spenser for his epic poem ""The Faerie Queene"". Each stanza contains nine lines in total. The first eight lines are in iambic pentameter, that is consist of ten syllables, followed by a single alexandrine line in iambic hexameter, that is are made up of twelve syllables. The rhyme scheme of these lines is ""a-b-a-b-b-c-b-c-c."""
"Many poets used the stanza after Spenser, for example Lord Byron (Chlide Harold's Pilgrimage), Percy Bysshe Shelley (Adonais), John Keats (The Eve of St. Agnes) and Alfred Tennyson (The Lotos-Eaters). Spenserian stanza remained a typical English form and it was never much popular outside England. Only few poets employed it in Central Europe, for example Juliusz Słowacki, Jan Kasprowicz and Jaroslav Vrchlický."

"It is found throughout sub-Saharan Africa where there are large bodies of open water with plenty of fish. It is the national bird of Zimbabwe, Zambia and South Sudan."
"This species looks a bit like the bald eagle. They are related, but live on different continents. The bald eagle lives in North America."

Fatima Naoot
"Fatima Naoot (Arabic: فاطمة ناعوت ) (born September 18, 1964) is an Egyptian writer and poet. In January 2016, the Egyptian government sentenced Naoot to jail for 3 years after she wrote on Facebook about killing sheep for the Eid holiday."
Work.
Naoot was a candidate for the Egyptian parliament.
Naoot wrote several books of poetry and a book of poetry analysis. She also translated collections of poems from English into Arabic.
Insulting religion.
"Fatima Naoot always seeks for freedom without any authority even if this authority will belong to any religion. In October she published a post on Facebook was describing ""the Eid Al-Adha’s tradition of slaughtering sheep as the “greatest massacre committed by human beings.” Then one candidate from parliament said that ""Her aim is to insult Islam"". Thus she wrote through Ahram Online report ""that humans justified their lust for killing and enjoying the smell of cooking game by attempting to bestow a divine meaning to their actions.” And because of the law that added in 1982 a legislation which stated that there is from six months to five years and fines of LE500 to LE1000 for anyone who uses religion to promote, through speech, writing, or any other medium, extremist ideas with the aim of spreading discord or to belittle one of the monotheistic religions or their different sects, or to harm national unity. she put in jail for 3 years and fined 20.000 LE. Although she said in front of the court that ""she did not aim to insult Islam, but she just explained her point of view. Naoot said through Middle east online ""I’m not sad about the sentencing as I don’t care about going to jail. I’m sad that the efforts of reformists have been wasted,”. As a result, THE ARAB NETWORK FOR HUMAN RIGHTS INFORMATION issued a statement which is ""“the recent surge in the prosecution of opinion makers comes in conjunction with a fierce security campaign launched by security bodies against freedom of opinion and expression, with the aim of narrowing the overall climate of freedom of opinion and expression. Such a matter, in turn, makes Egypt one of the most Arab countries that show hostility to freedom of expression as well as press freedom, especially that about 59 journalists have remained in prison so far.” Fatma is not a political figure, she is an Egyptian writer, poet, translator and journalist who always says her point of view."
Guadarrama National Park
Sierra de Guadarrama National Park () is a national park in Spain. It covers about . The park is one of the biggest national parks in Spain. Only four national parks are bigger.
Ecology.
"Guadarrama National Park has eleven different types of places for plants and animals to live (ecologies). More than 1,280 species of animals live in the park. Thirteen of them are endangered. There are more than 1,500 types of plants that come from the area. There are more than 30 types of vegetation."
Shita-kiri Suzume
"Shita-kiri Suzume (which means ""The Tongue-Cut Sparrow"") is a Japanese folk legend. It is told by many parents to their children. The story is about being kind and helping someone who is hurt. It is also about being mean and greedy."
Slavery.
"Slavery has long been practiced in Africa, just like the rest of the world. But two new slave trades would create a much bigger and more violent version of slavery."
"Between the 7th and 20th centuries, the Arab slave trade took 18 million slaves from Africa via trans-Saharan routes and the Indian Ocean. Between the 15th and 20th centuries (a period of 500 years), the Atlantic slave trade took an estimated 7–12 million slaves to the Americas. While some Africans collaborated with European and Asian slave traders, many were strongly opposed to slavery and avoided, protested, or fought it violently."
"Africans who had been captured and sent to the French colony of Saint Domingue on slave ships played an important role in ending the Atlantic slave trade. They began the Haitian Revolution, which created Haiti, the first country to permanently ban slavery. After this revolution, European empires began to reduce slave trading and abolitionism became more popular. Between 1808 and 1860, the British Navy captured approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard."
Colonialism.
"In the late 19th century, the European powers occupied much of the continent, creating many colonial and dependent territories. They left only two fully independent states: Liberia and Ethiopia (which the Europeans called “Abyssinia"")."
"Egypt and Sudan were never formally made a part of any European colonial empire. However, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt was effectively under British administration until 1922."
Modern history.
"African independence movements had their first success in 1951, when Libya became the first former colony to become independent. Modern African history is full of revolutions and wars, as well as the growth of modern African economies and democratization across the continent."
"A civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) began in 1998. Neighbouring African countries have become involved. Since the conflict began, it has killed an estimated 5.5 million people."
Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries.
Climate.
"From north to south, Africa has most types of climate. In sequence from the north:"
"Running north-east to the south is the East African Great Rift Valley. This has mountains, volcanoes, deep rifts and valleys, rivers and lakes."
"In fact, Africa has examples of most of the Earth's climate types."
Rainfall.
"Much of North Africa is dry and hot: it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive much rain. In Saharan Africa, there are few rivers or other water sources. Underground water sources are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert."
"In that part of the world, the wind comes mostly from the east. That does bring rain, but the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau block the monsoon rain and prevent it from getting to North Africa. Also, the Atlas Mountains near the north coast"
of Africa prevent rain from coming in from the north. That is another rain shadow.
These two rain shadows are mainly responsible for the Sahara desert.
"Conditions and winds are different further south, where huge amounts of rainfall near the equator. The equator runs across the middle of Africa (see red line drawn on map). That means much of Africa is between the two tropics:"
Plants and animals.
"Africa has a lot of wildlife. There are many types of animals there. In particular, it is now the only continent that has many native species of large mammals. Some of them occur in very large numbers. There are antelope, buffalo, zebra, cheetah, elephant, lion, giraffe, rhinoceros, apes, hyaena, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers."
Politics.
"The African Union (AU) is an international organisation. It aims to transform the African Economic Community, a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the African Union Government, consisting of legislative, judicial, and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the Pan African Parliament. A person becomes President of the AU by being elected to the PAP and then gaining majority support in the PAP."
"Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include Uganda, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Côte d'Ivoire. There are 54 UN member states in Africa."
People.
Africa was the homeland for the first people.
"People who come from Africa are called Africans. People in the north are called North Africans and people in the south are called South Africans. Languages in eastern Africa include Swahili, Oromo and Amharic. Languages in western Africa include Lingala, Igbo, Hausa and Fulani. The most popular language in Northern Africa is Arabic."
The most populated country in Africa is Nigeria.

شَهِدَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّهُۥ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ وَٱلْمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ وَأُو۟لُوا۟ ٱلْعِلْمِ قَآئِمًۢا بِٱلْقِسْطِ ۚ لَآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْحَكِيمُ ١٨
"Allâh bears witness that Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He always) maintains His creation in Justice. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise."
Purgatory
"According to the teaching of the Roman Catholic Church, Purgatory is the ""final purification of the elect"": ""All who die in God's grace and friendship, but still imperfectly purified, are indeed assured of their eternal salvation; but after death they undergo purification, so as to achieve the holiness necessary to enter the joy of heaven."""
"“In Purgatory there are different levels; the lowest is close to hell and the highest gradually draws near to Heaven. It is not All Souls Day, but, Christmas, that the greatest number of souls leave Purgatory."
"There are in Purgatory, souls who pray ardently to God, but for whom no relative or friend prays on earth. God makes them benefit from the prayers of other people."
"It happens that God permits them to manifest themselves in different way, close to their relatives on earth, in order to remind men of the existence of Purgatory and to solicit their prayers to come close to God who is just, but good."
Purgatory in art and culture.
"Perhaps the best-known instance of purgatory in the arts is Dante's ""Purgatorio"", the second book of his ""Divine Comedy"". Likewise, the Ghost in William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" may also presuppose a belief in purgatory,"
William Blake
"William Blake (28 November 1757 – 12 August 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker. He was born and died in London."
"During his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. Blake's first collection of poems, ""Poetical Sketches"", was printed around 1783. His most famous poem ""And did those feet in ancient time"" was, over 100 years later, put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called ""Jerusalem""."
Blake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organised by the BBC in 2002.

Institution
An institution is a social structure in which people cooperate and which influences the behavior of people and the way they live.
"An institution has a purpose. Institutions are permanent, which means that they do not end when one person is gone. An institution has rules and can enforce rules of human behavior. The word ""institution"" can be used in two ways. It can mean a very broad idea, or a very ""specific"" (narrow) one. For example:"
"Institutions, in the broad sense, are found in every society. The way that each institution works is different in different cultures. Some important institutions are:"
"Some societies have many institutions in the ""specific"" sense. These societies have an organised government, schools, hospitals, churches, clubs, armies, markets, courts and places for entertainment. Some societies have very few of these things, but this does not mean that there are no ""institutions"". The way in which the people relate to each other may have just as many ""controls"" as in a society with schools, markets and a government. An example of a society that has lots of ""specific"" institutions is Western Europe."
Historians look at institutions to find differences between eras or periods. They sometimes judge political and military events by the effect that they had on institutions.
Race (biology)
"In biology, races are distinct populations within the same species with relatively small morphological and genetic differences."
"The populations are ""ecological races"" if they arise from adaptation to different local habitats or ""geographic races"" when they are geographically isolated."
"If sufficiently different, two or more races may be described as subspecies, which is an official biological taxonomy unit below 'species'."
"If not, they are called ""races"", which means that a formal rank should not be given to the group, or taxonomists are unsure whether or not a formal rank should be given."
Kappa
"Kappa (uppercase/lowercase Κ κ) is the letter of the Greek alphabet used to represent the ""k"" sound in Ancient and Modern Greek. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 20. Letters that came from it include the Roman K and Cyrillic К."
"The letter κ always stands for the sound ""k"" in Greek. It is customary to transliterate (re-write) κ as ""c"" in English, but this is somewhat problematic since c is pronounced as ""s"" before e, i and y (which does not happen in Greek)."
"In mathematics, the lowercase formula_1 is used to represent the curvature of a curve, while the uppercase Κ is used to represent an ordinal number which is also a cardinal number."

Văn Cao
"Văn Cao (born Nguyễn Văn Cao; 15 November 1923 – 10 July 1995) was a famous Vietnamese composer. He wrote the Vietnamese national anthem, """". He, along with Pham Duy and Trinh Cong Son, is widely considered one of the three most important people in modern (non-classical) Vietnamese music."
Kojiki
"Kojiki or ""Furukotofumi"" (), also called in English the ""Records of Ancient Matters"", is the oldest book known in Japan. It was written 712 CE, and dedicated to Empress Gemmei. The Kojiki is a book about Japanese mythology (Shinto), legends, songs, genealogies, oral traditions, and semi-historical accounts down to 641 BCE. The book mixes the legends of first emperor of Japan and several others with stories about the gods. Therefore, it is difficult to know which parts of the Kojiki are real and which parts are legend. According to legend, all the emperors of Japan are descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess."
"The Kojiki is written in Chinese, but the way the Japanese wrote it is by using the pronunciation of the Chinese characters and not the meanings of them. In other words, a person who can read Chinese will not be able to read the Kojiki unless they also know how to speak Japanese. It includes many Japanese names and some phrases."
Sections.
"The Kojiki is divided into three parts: the , the and the ."
Hindu philosophy
"There are mainly six branches of Hindu Philosophy. These six schools of philosophy have been the result of ancient Indian thought and usually termed as ""Sad Darsana"". These are:"
"Among the above six schools of Hindu Philosophy, Vedanta is by far very popular. The Vedanta accepts the authority of the knowledge portions of the Vedas, called Upanishads."
Guru
"In the Sanskrit language, guru means teacher. Eastern religions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and newer movements such as Transcendental Meditation use ""guru"" as a title. They give it to a teacher (or guide) of religious matters."
"In Western usage, any person who has followers may be called a guru, even if he is followed for things other than religion or philosophy. A person with knowledge or expertise may be called a guru if he influences by personal teaching. Modern terms which have a rather similar meaning are mentor and tutor."
Satguru.
"Many Hindus have a satguru as well.The word ""guru"" means the one who removes the darkness from our heart. Satguru means true guru or true teacher. The title means that his students know that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to enlightenment. A satguru is a great soul who has realized God and is able to lead others along the path. God shines out from the satguru more brightly than from other people because he is very pure and enlightened. The satguru is devoted full time to religious life, is unmarried and has given up all possessions, personal life, family and friends. He has received an initiation from his satguru that gives him great spiritual power and authority. He can teach parents how to raise children, adults how to avoid problems and overcome any challenge in life, and in general he can make people feel close to God."
Moksha
"Moksha is the ultimate goal of personal spiritual development for some schools of Hinduism. It is the equivalent of Nirvana in Buddhism. In the Sanskrit language, ""moksha"" means freedom. It is as a state of eternal bliss and emptiness. According to Vedanta life is an endless cycle of birth, death, and rebirth into a physical universe. Hindu scriptures describe Moksha as the spiritual liberation from this cycle and the achievement of an eternal and blissful emptiness that transcends all of the joys, pain, and sorrow of the physical body or corporeal life. It is the goal of Hindu practitioners to achieve Moksha (freedom/liberation from the material world) through the practice of Yoga viz Jnana Yoga(knowledge), Karma Yoga(work), and Bhakti Yoga (through reciting prayers and worshipping God)."
"Moksha is a Vedic term. Scholars disagree about the precise relationship between the Moksha of Vedanta Hinduism and the Nirvana of Buddhism, but there is agreement that they are closely related historically and philosophically. Similarities can be found between Moksha and some concepts found in the Upanishads. Hindu texts explain the Moksha as Sat-Chit-Anand [True blissness of soul by separating the soul from the physical body by practising Dhyan and Yoga ]. Moksha originates from the Sanskrit word, moksa."
"The success of the first series started two revival series: one series that ran for several seasons on CBS and in syndication in the 1980s, and another series that ran on UPN from 2002 to 2003. It would also lead to a movie, a radio series, a comic book, a magazine and other spin-offs that would go on for 50 years."
"Aside from Serling himself, who wrote nearly two-thirds of the series' total episodes, writers for ""The Twilight Zone"" included authors such as Charles Beaumont, Richard Matheson, Jerry Sohl, George Clayton Johnson, Earl Hamner, Jr., Reginald Rose, Harlan Ellison and Ray Bradbury. Many episodes also featured adaptations of classic stories by such writers as Ambrose Bierce, Lewis Padgett, Jerome Bixby and Damon Knight."
"""Twilight Zone""'s writers often used science fiction as a way for social commentary. Television networks and sponsors who had censored all possible offensive material from the mostly live dramas were not aware of the methods developed by writers such as Ray Bradbury for dealing with important issues through fantasy. Themes include nuclear war, mass hysteria, and McCarthyism, subjects that were not allowed on more ""serious"" primetime television."
"The first series contained 156 episodes. Seasons 1, 2, 3, 5 were half hour shows. Season four (1962–1963) contained one-hour episodes."
Blackshirts
The Blackshirts were a Fascist paramilitary group in Italy during the rise and reign of Benito Mussolini. They operated from 1923-1943 . The SA or the Brownshirts was formed in 1921 by the National Socialist German Workers Party or better known as the Nazi Party .

"Caterine Deshayes, sometimes known as Catherine Monvoisin, or simply La Voisin was a murderous French serial killer. She was born around 1640, and executed as a witch on 16 February 1680, in Paris; together with several others. She played an important role in the so-called Affair of the Poisons. She lived from charging high fees to make horosocopes. She celebrated black masses, practiced abortions, sold love potions and poisons. She is said to have sacrificed infants. Together with the Hellfire club this is one of the earliest known examples of theistic satanism."
"Many nobles were among her clients, among them, Madame de Montespan a courtesan of Louis XIV."
Carol Burnett
"Carol Burnett is an American singer, writer, dancer, actress and comedian. She is notable for her stage and television acting. She began her career in New York. She had her own television program: ""The Carol Burnett Show"" (1967-1978 on CBS). Burnett was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1933."
"Burnett has won many awards. These include six Emmy Awards, five Golden Globes and a Tony."
Boy Meets Curl
"""Boy Meets Curl"" is the twelfth episode of The Simpsons twenty-first season. In this episode, The Simpson family visit Vancouver where Marge and Homer compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics in the mixed-doubles curling team with Seymour Skinner and his mother Agnes. Marge's sweeping earns a win for the team and they earn a spot for the Olympics. Meanwhile, Lisa is given an Olympic mascot pin and she decides to collect them but her pin collecting addiction goes out of control. Marge injures her shoulder in the semi-finals and she is told that she will never sweep again and that the American mixed curling team must concede the gold medal to Sweden. Lisa buys so many Olympic mascot pins that she doesn't have anymore money left so she trades her pearl necklace for a mascot pin from the 1924 Winter Olympics. Bart offers to help Lisa with defeating her pin collecting addiction and manages to get back her necklace by tricking the pin vendor with ""Fatov,"" who is a phony mascot that was ""created"" in advance for the 2014 Winter Olympics but the mascot is really Homer's mouth, clipped by Bart from his driver's license. When Marge is about to leave Vancouver, she reveals that she is left-handed to Homer and says that she always used her right hand to not seem unusual. She has enough strength to change Maggie's diaper and dress her with one hand. They both decide to re-participate in the gold medal game where they defeated Sweden and won the gold medal."
Ball and socket joint
"A ball and socket joint (enarthrosis, spheroidal joint) is a joint in which the ball-shaped surface of a bone fits into the cup-like indentation of another bone. This type of joint allows the bone to move in a 360° angle—with more freedom than other joints."
Examples.
Examples of this type of joint occur:
Alexandre Étienne Choron
"Alexandre Étienne Choron (Caen, 1837 – 1924) was a French chef. As ""chef de cuisine"" of the celebrated restaurant Voisin on the rue Saint Honoré, Choron is best known for his invention of Choron sauce, a béarnaise sauce enriched with tomato concentrate."
"Choron is also remembered for the food he served during the Siege of Paris by the Prussians, which began on 19 September 1870. During the siege, Parisians were reduced to eating cats, dogs, and rats. The bourgeois did not want to eat such ""low"" animals, and the ""de luxe"" restaurants had plenty of customers. As food reserves dwindled, these restaurants, including Voisin, improvised. Choron served exotic animal dishes at Voisin. For the midnight Christmas meal of 1870, Choron had a menu mostly of the best parts of the animals kept in the ""Jardin d'acclimatation"" (one of the Paris zoos). The menu – stuffed head of donkey, elephant consommé, roasted camel, kangaroo stew, bear shanks roasted in pepper sauce, wolf in deer sauce, cat with rat, and antelope in truffle sauce – has become legendary. The menu's wines were Mouton-Rothschild 1846, Romanée-Conti 1858 and Château Palmer 1864."
"Choron became famous for his elephant dishes (): ""Trompe d’éléphant in sauce chasseur"" and ""Éléphant bourguignon"". After the elephant at the ""Jardin d'acclimatation"" were used at the Christmas table, the two elephants (Castor and Pollux) at the Paris' ""jardin zoologique"" were consumed on 31 December 1870 at Voisin. In early January, it was the elephant at the ""Jardin des Plantes"" (Paris' botanical garden) which was sent to the abbatoir. It was bought by Choron for his restaurant at the price of 15 francs per pound. By 13 January Voisin was out of elephant meat and substituted horse. The siege was lifted two weeks later."
Femme Fatale
"Femme Fatale is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Britney Spears. It was released on March 25, 2011 by Jive Records."
Military career.
"Eisenhower was born into a family which did not have much money. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point as a cadet in 1911, and as an officer served in many different places including the Panama Canal Zone, Washington, D.C. and the Philippines. During World War II, he was a general. He directed the invasion of Morocco and Algeria during the North African Campaign. He became a 5-star general and was the Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord (an attack on Germany which was one of the most important battles of the war)."
"After World War II ended, he was considered a war hero. In the 1952 U.S. presidential election, the American public begged Eisenhower to run for president. Eisenhower (whose political views were unknown at the time) joined the Republican Party. He chose Richard Nixon as his vice-presidential candidate and won the election by beating Adlai Stevenson II."
"Presidency, 1953–61."
He served two terms from 1953 to 1961. Eisenhower was the first President of the United States to be president of all 50 states.
"During the beginning of his first term, he oversaw a ceasefire (which stopped the fighting) during the Korean War. He created NASA (the United States space program) which began a space race against the Soviet Union. Eisenhower believed that the United States should not try to fight wars overseas, but instead that United States should make more nuclear weapons so it could have an advantage in the Cold War. The United States was able to keep the Soviet Union in check without spending a lot of money. For this reason, the U.S. government had balanced budgets during his presidency and did not have to borrow money."
"He intimidated the Soviet Union by making them believe that the United States would respond to any act of aggression with the use of nuclear weapons. That policy is called brinkmanship, new look, and massive retaliation. He also authorized planes to spy on the Soviet Union, but when a U.S. spy plane accidentally crashed into the Soviet Union near the end of Eisenhower's term, it hurt relations between the United States and the Soviet Union."
"McCarthyism (when Senator Joseph McCarthy was accusing hundreds of people of being communist spies without evidence) was also an issue during his presidency. Eisenhower disliked Joseph McCarthy and tried to bring him down behind the scenes, but Eisenhower did not like to make enemies, so he did not talk about McCarthy much."
"Domestically (in the country), the economy was doing very well and the nation was prosperous. Eisenhower supervised the creation of the interstate highway system and created the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Eisenhower was a moderate conservative (near the center of the political spectrum). He wanted to continue some New Deal programs such as Social Security, but at the same time, he wanted the government to be limited. At first, many criticized him for not doing enough to give civil rights to African Americans, but later during his presidency, he signed two civil rights acts and sent federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas to make sure schools were desegregated."
Legacy.
When Eisenhower's presidency ended he was not very popular with scholars. Over time his reputation slowly improved and historians now generally consider him to be a good president.
"In September 2020, a presidential memorial was dedicated in Washington, D.C. honoring Eisenhower."

Ball could mean:
Ferrocement
"Ferrocement is both a method and a material used in building or sculpting with cement, sand, water and wire or mesh material. It is often called the thin shell. Thin shell ferrocement offers strength and economy and can be used in many ways including: building homes, creating sculptures, or building boats and ships."
Camera lens
"A camera lens is the part of a camera that directs light to the film or, in a digital camera, to a computer chip that can sense the light. Many cheap lenses are plastic but better ones are made from glass. The lens makes an image by focusing the light."
"The majority of cameras only have one lens that users cannot change or take out. This is called a ""fixed lens"" design. More expensive cameras usually have lenses that come off, so anyone can take out one lens and put in another. A lens may be simple, or may actually be made of several lenses."
"Photographers can use different lenses (objectives) to make different kinds of pictures. For example, a telephoto lens can take a picture of something far away. A wide-angle lens is the opposite. A zoom lens is more versatile; it can do both. There are many kinds of lenses."
The study of lenses and how they work is called optics.
"Lenses for large sheet film cameras are especially difficult to design. Cameras and their lenses have been made since the 19th century. Some from before World War II, are still usable today. Computers now let engineers make better lenses, though, because they can calculate the way that light goes through the lens and find the best design for each task. Together with lenses, filters, macro lenses, teleconverters, wide-angle and tele attachments are used."
Boy
"A boy is a young male human, either a child or teenager. Little boys still have the body of a child. It is not until they reach puberty (adolescence) that their bodies start to mature and they become a man."
The word “boy” was used a long time ago in Anglo-Saxon English. The opposite of a boy is a girl.
"The highway begins in the west at Dongshi District in Taichung. The highway used to go up into the Central Mountain Range along the Dajia River () valley through the townships of Guguan () and Cingshan (). At Lishan there is a branch that heads north to Yilan City. It goes through the mountains to Dayuling () which is the highest point of the route. Here another branch of the highway runs south from Dayuling to Wushe (). Continuing east from Dayuling, the highway goes down into Taroko National Park. It passes through Guanyuan (), Cih-en (), Luoshao () and Tiansiang () before entering Taroko Gorge. After the gorge the road then meets the eastern coastal Su'ao-Hualien Highway."
Closing the damaged highway.
"The highway goes through mountains. Rocks often fall and there can be landslides. Heavy rain from typhoons often push soil and rocks onto the highway so people cannot drive through parts of it. Earthquakes also damage the highway. On September 21, 1999 the Jiji earthquake caused a lot of damage to the highway and cut it in many places between Dongshih and Lishan."
"There was so much damage in 1999 that repairing it would cost a lot of money. The damaged parts of the highway were supposed to re-open in 2004. However, heavy rain from the Typhoon Mindulle added more damage to the highway. These parts were closed. The highway is still closed between Lishan and Guguan. There is no plan to repair it, but the New Central Cross-Island Highway is another way across the island."
Azorina vidalii
"Azorina vidalii (also known as the Azores bellflower) is the only species of the genus ""Azorina"" within the Campanulaceae, the bellflower family. This endemic species of the Azores is used as an ornamental plant in other countries besides the Azores."
"It was first given the name ""Campanula vidalii"" by Hewett Cottrell Watson in ""Hooker's Icones Plantarum"", table DCLXXXIV (684); Watson gave it the specific name ""vidalii"" after ""Capt. Vidal, R.N."", who collected the original plant. Heinrich Feer changed the name to ""Azorina vidalii"", creating a new genus ""Azorina"", in ""Botanische Jahrbücher für Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie"", 12, S. 611."
Description.
"The Azores bellflower is an evergreen, perennial herbaceous plant that grows to a height of 80 to 150 centimetres. It produces branches at the base and these branches are woody in the lower part. The plant has dark green leaves."
"The plant flowers from May to October. The inflorescence has many hanging, waxy, pale pink, bell-shaped flowers . The ""Azorina vidalii"" forma ""alba"" has, as the name suggests, white flowers."
Where it grows.
"The Azores bellflower is rare and usually grows in holes in cliffs near the sea, below the 50 metres of altitude. It is usually accompanied by the plant ""Salicornia"", which also tolerate the salt in the wind coming from the sea. The plant is found in all the islands of the Azores archipelago, but not on the island of Graciosa."
Mars in fiction
"Novels and short stories about Mars have been popular for over a hundred years. The planet's dramatic red color that some people can see is one reason for this. another is that the planet is close to Earth. Also, it looks somewhat like Earth. There are also stories about creatures from Mars on Earth and elsewhere."
"Near the end of the 19th century, the astronomer"
"Giovanni Schiaparelli reported seeing what he thought might be water channels on Mars. Because the Italian for channels is ""canali"", English translations tended to render the word as ""canals"", implying artificial construction. This led to the idea of intelligent beings on Mars before it apparently dried up."
"The following works of fiction deal with the planet itself, with any assumed Martian civilization as part of its planetary landscape."
Novels and short stories.
First stories.
"Several early modern writers, including Athanasius Kircher and Emanuel Swedenborg, hypothesized contact with Mars. Early science fiction about Mars often involved the first voyages to the planet, sometimes as an invasion force, more often for the purposes of exploration."
Living on Mars.
"By the 1930s, stories about reaching Mars had become somewhat trite, and the focus shifted to Mars as an alien landscape. New stories were set in a time after human contact and basic exploration. Some were about the colonization of Mars or otherwise used Mars as a setting rather than a goal."
1960s and later.
"Beginning in 1965, the Mariner and Viking space probes revealed that the canals were an illusion, and that the Martian environment is extremely hostile to life. By the 1970s, the ideas of canals and ancient civilizations had to be abandoned."
"Authors soon began writing stories based on the new Mars (frequently treating it as a desert planet). Most of these works have humans struggling to tame the planet, and some of them refer to terraforming (using technology to transform a planet's environment)."
"A common theme, particularly among American writers, is that of a Martian colony fighting for independence from Earth. It appeared already in Heinlein's ""Red Planet"" and is a major plot element in Greg Bear's ""Moving Mars"" and Kim Stanley Robinson's ""Mars"" trilogy. It is also part of the plot of the movie ""Total Recall"" and the television series ""Babylon 5"". Many video games also use this concept, such as the ""Red Faction"" and ""Zone of the Enders"" series. A historical rebellion of Mars against Earth is also mentioned in the ""Star Trek"" series of novels."
"In the decades following Mariner and Apollo, the once-popular subgenre of realistic stories about a first expedition to Mars fell out of fashion, possibly due to the failure of the Apollo Program to continue on to Mars. The early 1990s saw a revival and re-envisioning of realistic novels about Mars expeditions. Early novels in this renaissance were Jack Williamson's novel ""Beachhead"" and Ben Bova's novel ""Mars"" (both 1992), which envisioned large-scale expeditions to Mars according to the thinking of the 1990s. These were followed by Gregory Benford's ""The Martian Race"" (1999), Geoffrey A. Landis's ""Mars Crossing"" (2000), and Robert Zubrin's ""First Landing"" (2002), which took as their starting points the smaller and more focussed expedition strategies evolved in the late 1990s, mostly building on the concepts of Mars Direct."
Nostalgic Mars fiction.
"Several post-Mariner works are homages to the older phase of Mars fiction, circumventing the scientific picture of a dry and lifeless Mars with an unbreathable atmosphere through such science fiction generic staples as positing its future terraforming, or creating alternate history versions of Mars, where Burroughs' Barsoom, Bradbury's Martian Chronicles or The War of the Worlds are literal truth."
Martians in fiction.
"The industrial products are transportation equipment, commercial and private aircraft, food processing, publishing, chemical products, machinery, apparel, petroleum, and mining. 4% of Kansas's GDP is from the aviation industry. Many parts of airplanes are made in Wichita. Also, many important companies are near Kansas City, Missouri. For example, the Sprint Nextel Corporation is one of the biggest telephone companies in the United States. Its main operational offices are in Overland Park, Kansas."
Energy.
"Kansas has many renewable resources. Kansas is one of the biggest producers of wind power in the United States. In 2019, Kansas had an installed capacity of about 6,100 Megawatts (MW) from about 3,200 wind turbines. Wind produced the biggest amount of electricity from the state at 41%. An additional 700 MW of capacity was scheduled to become available during 2020. Kansas is also one of the biggest national producers of renewable ethanol and biodiesel fuels; Kansas produces about 600 million gallons per year."
"Kansas is eighth in US petroleum extraction. Production has slowly lowered because Kansas's limited economical reserves (especially from the Anadarko Basin) are being used up. Since oil prices reached their lowest level in 1999, oil production in Kansas has remained about the same; it had an average monthly rate of about in 2004. The recent higher prices have made carbon dioxide sequestration and other oil recovery techniques more economical."
"Kansas is also eighth in US natural gas production. Production has slowly lowered since the mid-1990s with the slow depletion of the Hugoton Natural Gas Field—the state's biggest field which extends into Oklahoma and Texas. In 2004, slower declines in the Hugoton gas fields and increased coalbed methane production contributed to a smaller overall decline. Average monthly production was over ."
Taxes.
"During his campaign for the 2010 election, Governor Sam Brownback said he would get rid of the state income tax. In May 2012, Governor Brownback signed into law the Kansas Senate Bill Substitute HB 2117. Starting in 2013, the ""ambitious tax overhaul"" lowered income tax, got rid of some corporate taxes, and created pass-through income tax exemptions. He raised the sales tax by one percent to make up for the loss of the other taxes. However, the sales tax was not enough to make up for it. He made cuts to education and some state services to make up for the lost revenue. The tax cut led to years of budget shortfalls. The worst was a $350 million budget shortfall in February 2017. From 2013 to 2017, 300,000 businesses were considered to be pass-through income entities and benefited from the tax exemption. The tax reform ""encouraged tens of thousands of Kansans to claim their wages and salaries as income from a business rather than from employment."""
"The economic growth that Brownback hoped for never happened. He argued that it was because of ""low wheat and oil prices and a fewer aircraft sales."" The state general fund debt load was $83 million in fiscal year 2010. By fiscal year 2017 the debt load sat at $179 million. In 2016, Governor Brownback earned the title of ""most unpopular governor in America"". Only 26 percent of Kansas voters approved of his job performance. 65 percent said they did not. In the summer of 2016, S&amp;P Global Ratings downgraded Kansas's credit rating. In February 2017, S&amp;P lowered it to AA-."
"In February 2017, a bi-partisan group wrote a bill that would repeal the pass-through income exemption, the ""most important provisions of Brownback's overhaul"", and raise taxes to make up for the budget shortfall. Brownback vetoed the bill but ""45 GOP legislators had voted in favor of the increase, while 40 voted to uphold the governor's veto."" On June 6, 2017 a group of Democrats and newly elected Republicans overrode Brownback's veto. They increased taxes to an amount that is close to what it was before 2013. Brownback's tax plan was described in a June 2017 article in ""The Atlantic"" as the United States' ""most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy"". The tax cuts had made schools and infrastructure difficult to get funding in Kansas."
Transportation.
Highways.
"There are two interstate highways in Kansas. The first part of the interstate highway opened on Interstate 70 west of Topeka. It opened on November 14, 1956."
"Interstate 70 is an important east–west highway. People can go from Kansas City, Missouri to Denver, Colorado. Cities on this highway include Colby, Hays, Salina, Junction City, Topeka, Lawrence, Bonner Springs, and Kansas City."
"Interstate 35 is a major north–south highway from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Des Moines, Iowa. Cities on this highway include Wichita, El Dorado, Emporia, Ottawa, and Kansas City (and suburbs)."
Airports.
"Kansas's only major commercial (Class C) airport is Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport. It is along US-54 on the western part of Wichita. Manhattan Regional Airport in Manhattan has flights every day to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. This would it the second-biggest commercial airport in Kansas. Most air travelers in northeastern Kansas fly out of Kansas City International Airport, which is in Platte County, Missouri. Some also use the Topeka Regional Airport in Topeka."
"In the state's southeastern part, people often use Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa, Oklahoma or Joplin Regional Airport in Joplin, Missouri. People in the far western part of the state often use the Denver International Airport. Connecting flights are also available from smaller Kansas airports in Dodge City, Garden City, Hays, Hutchinson, Liberal, or Salina."
Rail.
Passenger Rail.
"The ""Southwest Chief"" Amtrak route goes through the state on its route from Chicago to Los Angeles. Stops in Kansas include Lawrence, Topeka, Newton, Hutchinson, Dodge City, and Garden City. An Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach connects Newton and Wichita to the Heartland Flyer in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Amtrak may change the Southwest Chief route from using train service for the entire route. Plans call for shortening the route to Los Angeles to instead end in Albuquerque. Buses would replace the train on the route between Albuquerque and Dodge City, where train service east to Chicago would continue."
Freight Rail.
"Kansas has four Class I railroads, Amtrak, BNSF, Kansas City Southern, and Union Pacific, as well as many shortline railroads."
Law and government.
State and local politics.
"Executive branch: The executive branch has the governor, the lieutenant governor, the attorney general, the secretary of state, the treasurer, and the insurance commissioner."
"Legislative branch: The legislative branch is the Kansas Legislature. It is a bicameral legislature. It has the Kansas House of Representatives and the Kansas Senate. The House has 125 members, and the Senate has 40 members."
"Judicial Branch: The judicial branch is headed by the Kansas Supreme Court. The Kansas Supreme Court has seven judges. If there is a spot open, the governor picks who to replace them."
Political culture.
"Since the middle of the 20th century, Kansas has been socially conservative. In 1999 and 2005, the Board of Education voted to stop teaching evolution in schools. In 2005, Kansas banned same-sex marriage. In 2006, Kansas made the lowest age to marry 15 years old."
Kansas allowed women's suffrage in 1912. This was nearly a decade before the United States allowed it.
National politics.
"The state's current delegation to the Congress of the United States includes Republican Senators Pat Roberts of Dodge City and Jerry Moran of Manhattan; and Republican Representatives Roger Marshall of Great Bend (District 1), Steve Watkins (District 2), Ron Estes of Wichita (District 4), and Democratic Representative Sharice Davids (District 3)."
Songs of Experience
"Songs of Experience is the 12th album by Irish rock band, U2. It was released on 2017. The photo on the album cover shows Bono's son Eli and The Edge's daughter Sian holding hands. The photo is by Anton Corbijn."

Notes
Financial modelling
"The financial model for a start-up is an exercise in creativity and forward-thinking. It’s an opportunity for entrepreneurs to let their imagination run wild, finally voicing their visions on paper. As startups are generally risky investments, the financial model is a tool that helps investors evaluate the venture before committing funds. The main purpose of the startup financial model is to show investors that your company can reach profitability within a reasonable time frame and make them enough money to justify their investment."
Importance.
"Financial modeling is an integral part of the startup world. You can use models to predict future growth, understand the impact of certain decisions, and help raise funding. It's also a great tool to see how sensitive your business is to certain assumptions. You can change certain inputs to see how they affect your bottom line or different stages in your model. Models are also good tools for learning about new industries and understanding valuations (if you're looking at acquiring another business)."
Types.
"Financial models are mathematical representations of a financial situation. They can range from simple to complex, depending on the purpose and users of the model. Different model types are appropriate for different purposes, such as long-term strategic planning or annual budgeting."
"A company may use several different types of models at the same time. For example, a company may have a long-term strategic plan that it uses to inform its capital investment decisions, but it will also create an annual budget model to plan out how much cash it expects to spend and earn over the course of the year."
Financial modeling for startups.
Financial modelling for startups is the creation of a financial representation of a startup business. It's used to forecast future cash flows and profitability.
"Financial modelling is often used to assess a company's current financial health, its valuation and its potential for future growth. Financial modeling for startups is often used to prepare a document known as a pitch deck. This document is presented to investors and contains information such as: the company's business model, its target market, how it will make money, founders' backgrounds and its revenue projections."
"A financial model is not complete without a full set of business assumptions that make up the model. These assumptions are typically broken down by revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), operating expenses, depreciation and amortization (D&amp;A) and capital expenditures (CAPEX). The process of building a startup financial model is usually referred to as financial modeling."
The Heavenly Play
"The Heavenly Play () is a 1942 Swedish drama movie directed by Alf Sjöberg and starring Rune Lindström, Eivor Lindström, Anders Henrikson, Holger Löwenadler, Gudrun Brost, Arnold Sjöstrand, Emil Fjellström, Hugo Björne."
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
"The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) was a United States federal agency. It was founded on March 3, 1915. The agency researched flight technology and aircraft. On October 1, 1958, the agency was dissolved. Its employees were moved to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)."
Founding.
"NACA was founded on March 3, 1915. At that time, technology and culture were changing quickly. American flight technology was not as advanced as Europe's. The American public had mixed feelings about flight technology. Some people thought that flying was dangerous and foolish. Some thought that it was an important achievement in technology. But in Europe, people were more confident in flight technology."
"When World War I started in Europe, the Europeans were already using advanced flight technology. The Germans used airships to bomb British cities. Airplanes were used to spy on enemies. This worried the Americans, who realized that their flight technology is behind Europe's. In response, the federal government of the United States created NACA on March 3, 1915."
Research.
"By the 1920s, the NACA's mission was to promote military and civilian flight. The NACA did this by researching new flight technologies. To help this research, the NACA built many testing facilities. This included wind tunnels, test stands, and flight test facilities. The agency received a budget of $5000 in 1915."
World War II.
The NACA was involved in World War II. They helped research many flight technologies. A lot of the research that the NACA did before World War II was used to make American fighter planes fly better. They researched how to reduce drag. Drag slows down airplanes when moving in the air. They also researched how to stop the propellers of the plane from freezing.
NASA.
"On November 21, 1957, Hugh Dryden, NACA's director, established the Special Committee on Space Technology. This committee was created to help develop a space program."
"Croatian nouns are divided into three genders: the masculine, feminine and neuter gender. To know a noun's gender is very important because it affects all the words in a sentence that are tied to the noun, such as adjectives. A gender is determined by the noun's ending (with some exceptions). This makes it easier to tell what gender a noun is without memorizing the gender of every word. See the table below."
"Nouns retain their gender in plural. For instance, even though the noun 'žene' (women) ends in -e, it is of the feminine gender."
Grammatical aspects.
"Croatian verbs have two grammatical aspects: the perfective and imperfective. The perfective aspect depicts an action that has already been finished. The imperfective aspect depicts an action that is still continuing. So, each verb in its infinitive form can be written in 2 ways: in its perfective and imperfective aspect. The table below is showing 5 verbs both in their perfective and imperfective aspects."
Grammatical tenses.
"In Croatian, there are seven grammatical tenses. They can be divided in two ways: by the time they take place in and by their complexity. Simple tenses consist of only 1 word (simple tenses are aorist, imperfect, and present) while complex tenses consist of 2 or even 3 words (complex tenses are pluperfect, perfect, first future, second future) because they also consist of auxiliary verbs. Also, some grammatical tenses cannot be formed with both grammatical aspects, they work with only one aspect."
Common phrases.
"The Croatian week starts with Monday and ends with Sunday, unlike weeks from some other countries, where Sunday is the first day and Saturday the last."
Prize
A prize is an award given to a person or a group of people to reward good work.
"Official prizes often include monetary rewards as well as the fame that comes with them. Some prizes are given out in famous ceremonies, such as the Oscars."
"Prizes are given for a number of reasons: as an honour for special persons, for exemplary behaviour and to provide incentives in competitions, etc. In general, prizes are regarded in a positive light, and their winners are admired. However, many prizes, especially the more famous ones, have often caused controversy and jealousy."
Specific types of prizes include:
Christian Church
"The term Christian Church, Catholic Church or One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, as it was called by 110 AD, refers to the ""universal company of believers"". It means every person who has ever accepted or ever will accept the Christian Faith. The idea is that all these people together make up one ""body"" called ""the Church"". ""The Church"" (in this sense) is not thought of by Christians as an ordinary human organisation. It is thought of as being part of God's way to bring people close to him. ""The Church"" was begun by Jesus in the 1st century AD. It is called ""The Christian Church"" because Jesus was called ""The Christ"" (or holy one from God)."
"Today there are many churches in the sense of ""church organisations"". The different organised churches are called Christian denominations."
"The main Christian beliefs are held by all major Christian denominations. These beliefs are often said aloud by Christian people in a ""statement of faith"" which is called the Creed. The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Lutheran, Anglican Communion and other Protestant churches all believe that God is the ""creator and eternal father of all things"", that Jesus was the ""Christ"" and son of God who died to save people from the punishment for their sins, and that the Holy Spirit is God's gift to help and comfort Christian people. Christians believe that these are three parts of One God."
There are many other beliefs that are different between different denominations. These differences have sometimes caused arguments and have caused the organised church to split into denominations. The different opinions are called controversies.
"During Late Antiquity, the Christian Church started became the most important persecuting organization in human history."
Terminology.
"The English word ""church"" comes from the Greek κυριακή (kyriake) meaning ""Master's (house)"", or ""Lord's (house)"". In modern English the word ""church"" is used for both a church building and ""the Christian Church"" throughout the world."
"In 381 AD, at the a meeting of bishops known as the First Council of Constantinople, the Nicene Creed (a statement of beliefs) that was used at the time was changed to include a description of the Church. The words that were added to the Nicene Creed are ""One Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church"". This important addition describes the four most important things that Christians were to believe about the Christian Church."
These are the four words that are used in the Nicene Creed:
Controversies.
"One important controversy is simply the definition of the Christian or Catholic Church. To some degree this controversy comes from the Nicene Creed with its words ""One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church"" which means ""universal"" church. Many denominations believe that all denominations are part of a world-wide Christian Church and think that the most important thing is the ""common faith"" and not a common organisation or tradition. (""Common faith"" means ""the faith that is the same"". The word ""common"" does not mean ""ordinary"" in this sense.)"
"For many hundreds of years, the Roman Catholic Church has regarded itself as the only Christian Church and has called itself the ""Catholic"" (or ""universal"") church. In other words, only those people who were within the ""organisation"" of the Roman Catholic Church were believed to belong to the ""Universal Church"". In the 20th century this view began to change and in the late 20th century there was a strong movement within parts of the Roman Catholic Church to reach out to other denominations. The Eastern Orthodox Church has thought of itself in the same way, but in the late 20th century there has been much more discussion between the Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic, Lutheran and Anglican Churches. Some smaller denominations such as Jehovah's Witnesses also believe that they are the one and only true Christian Church."
Church (disambiguation)
Church could mean:
"Harold Pinter CH CBE (10 October 1930 – 24 December 2008) was a British playwright, screenwriter, director and actor. Pinter was Jewish. He was born and raised in Hackney, east London."
"His plays include: ""The Birthday Party"", ""The Homecoming"" and ""Betrayal"", all of which he adapted into movies. His adaptations of others' works include: ""The Servant"", ""The Go-Between"", ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"", ""The Trial"" and ""Sleuth""."
"The critic Irving Wardle called Pinter's early plays ""comedies of menace"". He meant that the plays begin with an apparently innocent situation. The situation becomes both threatening and ""absurd"" as Pinter's characters behave in strange ways. Pinter acknowledged that Samuel Beckett influenced his early work. They became friends, sending each other drafts of their works in progress for comments."
Pinter was married to Vivien Merchant from 1956 until they divorced in 1980. He was married to Antonia Fraser from 1980 until his death. He was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in 2001 and died from the disease in London seven years later when it metastasised to his liver.
Structured settlement
A Structured settlement is an insurance or financial arrangement that is negotiated to end a lawsuit. It is a legal agreement through which an insurance company agrees to make regular payments to a specific individual over a period of time.
"Structured settlements created as a way for insurance companies to payout settlements in installments as opposed to large lump sums. Structured settlements may benefit injured people whose settlements might result in their owing taxes, by allowing them to reduce or delay tax payments. They may also benefit younger people or disabled people by providing periodic payments of money over an extended period of time."
"Structured settlements require the paper holder (a name for the person who receives payments from the settlement) to wait before they will get money, by spreading payments over a number of years. However there are companies offering to buy such a structured settlement for upfront money. For example, a company might offer to buy a settlement that would be paid in 20 yearly payments for a one-time payment of lower value. Such financing may need to be approved by judge and the insurance company."
"In the United States, the sale of a structured settlement may result in tax liability under the Internal Revenue Code."
Die Fledermaus
"Die Fledermaus () is an opera by Johann Strauss II. Its first performance took place on April 5, 1874 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna, Austria. The opera has been presented on New Year's Eve in Vienna since the early 1930s. ""Die Fledermaus"" is based on the French play ""Le Réveillon"" (1872) by Meilhac and Halévy."
Term life insurance
"Term life insurance or term assurance is life insurance that provides coverage for some sum of money during a given period of time. After the term stated in original contract expires, the sum of money paid to insurance company will need to be renegotiated and will often increase. Term insurance is the cheapest way of buying life insurance."
"Term life insurance is the original form of life insurance and is different to permanent insurance because its rates will not go up, and there is a fixed term contract, which will end in the future. Permanent life insurance contracts can last until the death of insured person, but the rates will slowly increase over time."
"Because term life insurance is only death insurance, it is used to cover mortgages (guarantee that the bank will receive their money), payment to the families (upon death of insured person his family will usually receive repayment for funeral costs and in some cases will get some money), repayment of debts."
"The simplest form of term life insurance is a one-year contract. The death benefit will be paid if the insured dies. If he does not die during this the coverage period no claims are paid, and a new contract must be written."
"Term life insurance is the most affordable type of life insurance because it is temporary and builds no cash value inside the policy over time. Term life is “pure protection”, not an investment."
Level term life insurance is a type of term life insurance plan that has guaranteed level rates and amounts of coverage for the entire term of the policy.
"Level term life plans may offer coverage with level rates for a period of 10, 15, 20 or 30 years. Some term life insurance plans provide life insurance to age 65 or 70, but your rate will increase after the “level term” period."
Eisteddfod
The Eisteddfod is a Welsh festival of literature and music. The idea of the festival goes back at least to the 12th century.
Denbighshire
"Denbighshire is a shire in northeast Wales, in the United Kingdom. It has over 90,000 people. The largest town is Rhyl."
Rhyl
"Rhyl (), pronounced ""Rill"", is a seaside resort and community in Denbighshire in North Wales. It is in the historic county of Flintshire and the preserved county of Clwyd. In 2011, the town's population was 25,149. This makes it one of the largest settlements in North Wales."
"The town was once an elegant Victorian resort. Influences from Liverpool and Manchester, both cities in England, after World War II changed the town. By 1990, the town had declined. However, since then the town has had major regeneration."
"His son, Otto Wilhelm von Struve (1819–1905) succeeded him as director (1862–89) of the Pulkovo Observatory."
Mario Party (series)
"Mario Party is a series of video games made by Nintendo. The idea of each game is that Mario and his friends must travel across a game board and earn stars and coins. Each new game in the series contains new characters, playing boards, and mini-games. Every few turns, each character must participate in a mini-game. The winner generally gets 10 coins."
Helsinki
"Helsinki () is the capital city of Finland. Helsinki is the largest city in Finland. 604,380 (31.12.2012) people live in Helsinki, and 1,360,000 live in the Helsinki metropolitan area."
"Helsinki is in the south of Finland, on the coast of the Gulf of Finland. The city is in the Uusimaa region. When one looks from Helsinki, Tallinn is on the opposite side of the sea, but it is too far away to see. A poetic name for Helsinki is ""the daughter of the Baltic Sea""."
History.
"In 1550, Swedish king Gustav Vasa commanded people to build a new city and move there. His idea was to build a new place to trade, which would be more popular than Tallinn. The idea did not work well, and many people returned from Helsinki to their homes. Later Sweden built the fortress Suomenlinna in Helsinki. After Russia had taken Finland from Sweden in several wars, they started developing Helsinki. Helsinki became the capital of autonomous province of Finland. When Finland became independent in 1917, Helsinki stayed as the capital city."
Geography.
"Helsinki spreads around several bays and over several islands. Some famous islands include Seurasaari, Lauttasaari and Korkeasaari - which is also the country's biggest zoo - as well as the fortress island of Suomenlinna (Sveaborg)."
"The metropolitan area of Greater Helsinki also includes two of Finland's biggest cities, Espoo to the west of Helsinki, and Vantaa to the north. These two cities, along with Helsinki itself and the small town of Kauniainen (which is in fact surrounded by Espoo), make up the Capital Region (""Pääkaupunkiseutu"" in Finnish or ""Huvudstadsregionen"" in Swedish). There are other towns nearby that are part of Greater Helsinki, including Järvenpää, Kerava, Tuusula, Nurmijärvi, Sipoo, Kirkkonummi, Mäntsälä and Vihti. They have become popular places for Helsinki commuters to live."
Transport.
The public transportation network in Helsinki and its area consists of
"Helsinki Airport is located in Vantaa about 20 kilometers north of Helsinki city center. The airport offers both domestic flights within Finland and international flights to Europe, Asia and North America."
"Helsinki offers several boat services to Tallinn and Stockholm every day, along with ferries to places including the island of Suomenlinna."
Jehovah's Witnesses
"Jehovah's Witnesses are a religious group with more than eight million members around the world. They believe God, who's name is Jehovah (Ps. 83:18), will end crime, violence, sickness and death by destroying all wickedness in the world. They say that God's Kingdom (mentioned (thy Kingdom come) in the Lord's prayer) will restore God's original purpose for the Earth: bringing about peace for all humans who live by Bible standards."
"Their beliefs are based solely upon the Bible. These beliefs were taught by Charles Taze Russell, a preacher who started a Bible study group in Pennsylvania in 1876. The goal of Russell and other Bible Students, as the group was then known, was to promote the teachings of Jesus Christ and to follow the practices of the first-century Christian congregation. Since Jesus is the Founder of Christianity, they view him as the founder of their organization.—Colossians 1:18-20. They later started publishing a religious magazine called ""The Watchtower""."
"Some of their beliefs, especially about who God is and what his plans are for humans and the earth, are different from what is taught in most Christian churches. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that only 144,000 people will go to heavenRev 7:1-17,Rev 14:1 and that all the other people who obey God will live forever on a paradise Earth. They do not believe that God is a Trinity. They believe Jesus died on a pole (also called '[torture] stake') rather than a cross. God rejects worship that uses images or symbols, including the cross ""Idolatry"" Ex 20:4-6. They teach that when people die, they remain in the grave until God resurrects them after God's Kingdom, or government, is ruling over earth."
"Jehovah's Witnesses are best known for preaching their beliefs from door-to-door and in other public places, and offering their magazines, ""The Watchtower"" and ""Awake!"" They are also well known for refusing to join armies and refusing blood transfusions."
History.
"In 1870 a young clothing shop owner named Charles Taze Russell heard an Adventist preacher speak. The preacher said the Bible contained clues that showed God was about to set up a kingdom, or government, over earth. He said the kingdom, which is mentioned many times in the New Testament of the Bible, would be based in heaven, and it would completely change the way of life for everyone in the world. Russell studied that preacher's teachings and looked through the Bible, and ended up with some new beliefs."
Beginnings.
"Using various Bible verses and events from history, Russell decided that God would soon call a group of ""saints"" to heaven to be kings there. Other faithful Christians who had since died would also make up a total of 144,000 kings in heaven. Churches at the time taught that humans were still waiting for Jesus to return to earth in his Second Coming, but Russell believed that clues in the Bible showed Jesus returned in 1874. Russell believed part of God's plan was to start Armageddon, which he thought would be a complete breakdown of law and order on earth, when governments and people would fight among themselves. He believed that God would then end sickness and death and allow obedient Christians to live forever in perfect health."
"Russell believed it was very important that all Christians, including those who were attending churches, should learn those ""truths"". He believed these ""truths"" had been carefully hidden in the Bible for thousands of years. He started a publishing group called the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. He wrote several books, set up some Bible study classes for people to study his teachings, and started a magazine, ""Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence"", which taught that Christ was already present. He wrote that God would bring about all those events by 1914."
A new president.
"By the time Russell died in 1916, he had written 50,000 pages, with almost 20 million copies of his books printed and distributed around the world. Joseph Franklin Rutherford, one of his followers, took Russell's position as president of the Watch Tower Society."
"Rutherford wrote many books as well. He made some changes to Russell's teachings and required all the study groups, or congregations, around the world to agree to the teachings and rules set by the Watch Tower Society in New York. He told all members to no longer celebrate all holidays, singing at religious meetings was strictly prohibited and preaching from door to door about God's Kingdom and to distribute Watch Tower Society publications so more people would hear the message was mandatory. Many members did not agree with Rutherford's harsh changes, and some started their own groups. In 1931 Rutherford called his group ""Jehovah's Witnesses"" to tell it apart from the other groups. By the time Rutherford died in 1942, the religion had a worldwide membership of 115,000."

Smoke detector
"A smoke sensor or smoke detector is a device that can detect smoke, which may be an indicator of a fire. There are two basic systems: Simple, standalone sensors usually make a sound or flash a light when they detect smoke. More sophisticated sensors usually send a signal to an fire alarm panel, or system. Most smoke detectors use either an optical sensor, or they use a physical process called ionization. Many simple smoke sensors use batteries. Very often dead batteries are not replaced; when this happens, the smoke sensors stop working. But, the detector may ""chirp"" when the battery is low to try and stop this from happening. There are also systems which are directly connected to electrical power; these may use batteries just as a backup."
"Smoke detectors are housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about in diameter and thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization); detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out."
Design.
Photoelectric.
"Photoelectric smoke detectors rely on detecting a lack of light to set the alarm off. The light used could be infrared, visible light, or ultraviolet. When smoke blocks out the light inside a photoelectric smoke detector, the smoke detector detects that there is less light. Below a certain brightness, whether or not it comes from smoke or not, the photoelectric smoke detector will beep."
Ionization.
"Ionization smoke detectors use radioactive elements to ionize the air. Alpha particles are released from the radioactive element onto air particles so that those air particles become charged. An ionization smoke detector will detect smoke if there is a change in voltage. If smoke enters the smoke detector, some of the alpha particles will attach to the smoke instead of the air particles. This will change the voltage inside the smoke detector, so the smoke detector will beep."
"Ionization smoke detectors are cheaper than photoelectric smoke detectors, but they cause more false alarms than photoelectric smoke detectors. Additionally, ionization smoke detectors are slower to react in real house fires."
In Square Circle
"In Square Circle is the twentieth studio album by American singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder. It was released on September 13, 1985 by Tamla. It is his first studio since 1980's ""Hotter Than July""."
Track listing.
"All songs written, produced and arranged by Stevie Wonder."

Jungle Fever (soundtrack)
"Jungle Fever a soundtrack album by American musician Stevie Wonder to Spike Lee's movie ""Jungle Fever"". It was released by Motown Records on May 28, 1991. It is Wonder's third soundtrack album and the music on the album was very ""urban"" as they had influences from new jack swing, hip hop as well as R&amp;B and soul."
Critical reception.
"""Jungle Fever"" received mixed reviews from critics. While some thought it was unappealing, others said it was his best work in years. A critic said he hadn't so freewilling since Hotter Than July."

Triatominae
"The members of Triatominae are a subfamily of Reduviidae. They are also called kissing bugs, conenose bugs, assassin bugs or triatomines. There are more than 130 species in this subfamily. Most of them feed on vertebrate blood. A few species feed on other invertebrates. They are mainly found in the Americas. There are a few species in Asia, Australia and Africa."
"Some of the bugs carry the Chagas disease parasite ""Trypanosoma cruzi"". However, only those species (such as ""Triatoma infestans"" and Rhodnius prolixus) well adapted to living with humans are considered important vectors."
Flirting
"Flirting is a form of human behavior from one person toward another person, or between two people, usually showing a sexual or romantic interest in the other person. It can include conversation, body language (such as winking), or short physical contact."
Trustworthiness
Trustworthiness or honesty is mainly a moral value. A trustworthy person is someone in whom we can place our trust and be sure that the trust will not be betrayed. Examples could be
"The first example is moral. It depends on what we know about the person, their family and upbringing."
"The second example is technical. We would need to know what kind of jobs the person had done before and, perhaps, what kind of training he had."
"In order for one to trust another,their worth and integrity must be proven over time. That applies especially to the first (moral) case."
"Trustworthiness in technical matters may be identified by attributes such as reliability, dependability and qualifications."
Shamisen
"The shamisen or samisen (Japanese: 三味線, literally ""three taste strings""), also called sangen (literally ""three strings"") is a Japanese musical instrument with three strings, that is played with a big plectrum called a ""bachi"". The pronunciation in Japanese is usually ""shamisen""."
Obi
"Obi (帯, おび) is a Japanese word meaning ""belt"" or ""band"". Mostly, it is used to describe the types of sash worn with kimono and keikogi."
"Obi are worn by both men and women. They can be very simple, made of one layer of lightweight fabric, or decorated heavily, made of stiff, woven material, embroidered and dyed with different designs."
"Obi for men are less wide and shorter than obi for women. Men mostly wear ""kaku"" obi, but sometimes wear ""heko"" obi, which are made of much softer material. ""Heko"" obi are worn casually, but ""kaku"" obi can be worn casually and formally."
"Obi for women are much wider and longer. Most women usually wear a ""nagoya"" obi, which is wider at one end. In summer, women wear ""hanhaba"" obi with ""yukata"". Formal obi for women can be woven from metallic yarns, covered in embroidery, or dyed in an elegant design."
"Obi for women are usually the most expensive part of a kimono outfit. However, obi for men can be expensive as well. Expensive obi are usually made by very skilled artists. Some of these people are called National Living Treasures because they are so skilled."
"Obi worn for practicing martial arts are a lot thinner and shorter than other kinds of obi. They come in different colours, and the colours show how skilled someone is in practicing martial arts. When someone becomes skilled enough, they wear a new colour of obi. Both men and women wear the same size and length of obi in martial arts, and they are not decorated with embroidery or dyes designs."
Nitrogen fixation
Nitrogen fixation how nitrogen in the air (N2) is changed (converted) into ammonia () or other nitrogenous compounds in the soil.
"Nitrogen fixation is essential to life because nitrogen compounds are needed for making all nitrogen-containing organic compounds, such as amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids."
"Atmospheric nitrogen is a relatively unreactive molecule. It is useless to all except a few bacteria and archaea. Biological nitrogen fixation converts into ammonia, which is used (metabolized) by most organisms."
Nitrogen is fixed in biological and non-biological ways:
Biological.
Microorganisms that fix nitrogen (diazotrophs).
"Cyanobacteria are in most environments on Earth. They play key roles in the carbon and nitrogen cycle of the biosphere. Cyanobacteria use many sources of combined nitrogen, like nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, urea, or some amino acids."
Several cyanobacteria are also diazotrophs which can fix nitrogen from the air. This is an ability which may have been present in their last common ancestor in the Archaean.
"Cyanobacteria in coral reefs can fix twice the amount of nitrogen than on land—around 1.8 kg of nitrogen is fixed per hectare per day. The colonial marine cyanobacterium ""Trichodesmium"" may fix nitrogen on such a scale that it accounts for almost half of the nitrogen-fixation in marine systems on a global scale."
Root nodule symbioses.
"Fasting is a kind of abstinence. It is when someone does not eat or drink for some specified period of time. It is only the case if the person does so of his or her own will. It may also be that the person only eats and drinks certain kinds of food. Most often, fasting is done for religious reasons. Depending on the tradition, fasting practices may forbid sexual intercourse, (or any sexual desire), masturbation, as well as refraining from eating certain types or groups of food (e.g. meat)."
"Fasting for religious and spiritual reasons has been a part of human custom since pre-history. It is mentioned in the Qur'an, in the Mahabharata, in the Upanishads, and in the Bible, in both the Old and New Testament. In Buddhism it is also taught as a way to getting Nirvana."
"In almost all cases, there are exceptions for observing the fasting. These are made for the following groups of people"
Politics.
Fasting as a form of protest is called a hunger strike.
Intermittent fasting.
Timed fasting is known as Intermittent fasting.
There are different ways to time your fast. You can:
Walpurgis Night
"Walpurgis Night (""Valborgsmässoafton"" in Swedish, ""Vappu"" in Finnish, ""Volbriöö"" in Estonian, ""Valpurģu nakts"" or ""Valpurģi"" in Latvian, ""Walpurgisnacht"" in German), ""Čarodějnice"" in Czech is a holiday celebrated on April 30 or May 1, in Finland, Sweden, Bohemia (Czech Republic), Estonia, Latvia and Germany."
Origins.
"The festival is named after Saint Walburga (known in Scandinavia as ""Valborg""; alternative forms are ""Walpurgis"", ""Wealdburg"", or ""Valderburger""), born in Wessex in 710 a niece of Saint Boniface. According to legend, she was a daughter to the Saxon prince St. Richard. Together with her brothers she travelled to Württemberg, Germany where she became a nun and lived in the convent of Heidenheim, which was founded by her brother Wunibald. Walburga died on 25 February 779 and that day still carries her name in the Catholic calendar. However she was not made a saint until 1 May in the same year, and that day carries her name in the Swedish calendar."
"Historically the Walpurgisnacht is derived from Pagan spring customs, where the arrival of spring was celebrated with bonfires at night. Viking fertility celebrations took place around April 30 and due to Walburga being declared a saint at that time of year, her name became associated with the celebrations. Walburga was worshipped in the same way that Vikings had celebrated spring and as they spread throughout Europe, the two dates became mixed together and created the Walpurgis Night celebration."
Germany.
"In Germany, Walpurgisnacht, the night from April 30 to May 1, is the night when allegedly the witches hold a large celebration on the Blocksberg and await the arrival of Spring. When the travel to that mountain is too far, they may also chose another hill in the region they live."
"""Walpurgis Night (in German folklore) the night of April 30 (May Day's eve), when witches meet on the Brocken mountain and hold revels with their Gods..."""
"""Brocken the highest of the Harz Mountains of north central Germany. It is noted for the phenomenon of the Brocken spectre and for witches' revels which reputably took place there on Walpurgis night."
"The Brocken Spectre is a magnified shadow of an observer, typically surrounded by rainbow-like bands, thrown onto a bank of cloud in high mountain areas when the sun is low. The phenomenon was first reported on the Brocken."""

Avian influenza
"Avian influenza (bird flu, or grippe of the birds), is an illness caused by a virus. The virus, called ""influenza A"" or ""type A"", usually lives in birds. Sometimes it infects mammals, including humans."
"There are many types of influenza A, which was first found in a bird in Italy in 1878. Most types have weak symptoms, such as breathing problems, similar to the common cold."
"But some types kill birds, and a few kill humans and other mammals. One type of bird flu, called ""Spanish flu"", killed 50 to 100 million people in 1918/1920. Another type, called ""Asian Flu"" killed one million in 1957, and another one, called ""Hong Kong Flu"", also killed one million people in 1968."
"A subtype, called ""H5N1"", killed six people in Hong Kong in 1997, but did not kill again until 2003, this time in China. Until the middle of 2005, it was primarily found in southeast Asia but since then has spread to parts of Africa and Europe. It has killed tens of millions of birds and resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of millions of other birds to limit its spread. So far it is mostly a bird disease and rarely infects humans. The concern about H5N1 is that it is constantly evolving at a very fast rate. It might create a human flu pandemic. Governments around the world are spending money to deal with this problem: studying H5N1, creating vaccines, conducting pandemic practice exercises, stockpiling useful flu medication, and many other activities."
Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy
"The ""Jyllands-Posten"" Muhammad cartoons controversy is a controversy about a series of cartoons. They were first published in a Danish newspaper. The publication led to an outcry, and sparked violent protests in the Islamic world, with many people dying. The cartoons were drawn and created by Kurt Westergaard."
"The crisis began after cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad were published in the Danish newspaper ""Jyllands-Posten"" on September 30, 2005. Danish Muslim organizations staged protests in response. As the controversy has grown, some or all of the cartoons have been reprinted in newspapers in more than fifty other countries. The protests got worse when fake cartoons were released."
"One of the cartoons showed Muhammad with a bomb in his turban. Some people thought this was saying that all Muslims are terrorists. But other cartoons made fun of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. One insulted the editors of the newspaper, by using the language Farsi."
"Critics claims that the cartoons are culturally insulting, Islamophobic, blasphemous, and intended to humiliate a ""marginalized"" minority. However, supporters of the cartoons claim they illustrate an important issue and their publication exercises the right of free speech. They have also claimed that similar cartoons are made relative to other religions, arguing that Islam and its followers have not been targeted in a discriminatory way."
History.
"The Cure began in 1976 as 'Easy Cure'. It was formed by Robert Smith (vocals, guitar) together with schoolmates Michael Dempsey (bass), Lol Tolhurst (drums), and local guitarist Porl Thompson."
"They began writing and demoing their own songs almost immediately, playing throughout 1977 in Northern England to an ever growing army of fans. In May 1978 the 'Easy' was dropped, along with Porl, and an eager trio now known simply as The Cure were quickly signed to Tony Wilson's Factory label."
First album.
"In May 1979 their debut album ""Three Imaginary Boys"" was released to great acclaim, and as the band toured extensively around the UK, the singles “Boys Don't Cry” and “Jumping Someone Else's Train” were released. They supporting Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias and The Smirks in June and July and again with Siouxsie and the Banshees in August to October 1979. Michael left the band at the late of the year, and Simon Gallup (bass) and Matthieu Hartley (keyboards) joined. In March 1980 the 4-piece Cure embarked on an exploration of the darker side of Robert's songwriting, and emerged with the minimalist classic Seventeen Seconds, along with their first real 'hit single' “A Forest.”"
Results and second album.
"After an intense world tour Matthieu left the group, and in early 1981 the trio recorded an album of mournful atmospheric soundscapes entitled ""Faith"", which included another successful single in “Primary.”"
Third album.
"The band then set out on a second trip around the world, named “The Picture Tour,” and they put out the single “Charlotte Sometimes.” In 1982 The Cure went back into the studio to record the album “Pornography” which had a dark mood. The trip was difficult for the band members, and the single “The Hanging Garden” came out just as Simon left the band."
First dance single.
"Robert Smith and Lol Tolhurst were now the only band members. To feel better, the band chose to change the dark mood of the band into a more fun “pop” mood. So they recorded a dance single called “Let's Go To Bed,” and became good friends with the song's film-clip director, Tim Pope. The band continued into 1983 with two more fun singles: “The Walk” and “The Lovecats.”"
Fourth album.
"In 1984 ""The Top"" was released, a strange hallucinogenic mix, which contained the infectiously psychedelic single “The Caterpillar.”"
Expansion of the band.
"The world ‘Top Tour’ saw the band expand to a 5-piece, with the addition of Andy Anderson (drums) and Phil Thornalley (bass), and the return of Porl Thompson (guitar)."
"The new Cure sound was captured live for the album ""Concert"". Andy and Phil left soon after the end of the tour, and were replaced by Boris Williams (drums) and further returnee Simon Gallup (bass). This new incarnation started work on 1985's The Head On The Door with a very real sense of 'something happening'... The vibrant hit single “Inbetween Days” was followed up by “Close To Me,” and the ensuing world tour paved the way for the massive success of the singles collection ""Standing On A Beach"" in 1986. That summer saw the band headline the Glastonbury Festival for the first time, and a year of extensive gigs and festivals was crowned by Tim Pope's live concert film The Cure In Orange."
First double album.
"In 1987 The Cure brought out ""Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me"", an immense double album of extreme and extraordinary stylistic range, and with the arrival of Roger O'Donnell on keyboards the 6-piece Cure traveled the world with the 'Kissing Tour', enjoying four more hit singles along the way. The wonderfully atmospheric ""Disintegration"" was demoed in 1988 and released in 1989, and despite being a work of powerful brooding grandeur, it too gave rise to four hit singles. The 'Prayer Tour' followed, with the band back down to a five-piece following the departure of Lol Tolhurst. It was captured live for the album ""Entreat""."
Replacing Roger O'Donnell.
"In early 1990 Roger O'Donnell left the group, and was replaced by long-time band friend Perry Bamonte, just in time for a series of headlining European festival shows that included the band's second Glastonbury headline slot. The album ""Mixed Up"" was released, supported by the re-mixed singles “Never Enough,” “Close To Me” and “A Forest,” and in 1991 The Cure at last won some long overdue “home” recognition with a Brit Award for “Best British Group.”"
Sixth album.
"In 1992 they recorded ""Wish"", a richly diverse multi-faceted guitar driven album hailed by some as their best work to date. It spawned 3 fabulous hit singles, and the glorious ‘Wish Tour' that followed was a worldwide sell out. The sheer power of the shows inspired the release of two live works in 1993, Paris and Show. Immediately after the tour ended, guitarist Porl Thompson left the band again (this time with a smile!), and The Cure headlined the XFM 'Great Xpectations Show' in London's Finsbury Park as a 4-piece. The band also contributed ”Burn” to the film “The Crow” and covered “Purple Haze” for the Hendrix tribute album 'Stone Free'."
Seventh album.
"In 1994 Boris Williams decided to move on, and in early 1995 Jason Cooper took up residency behind the drum kit, with Roger O'Donnell rejoining once more on keyboards. Work on the next album was interspersed with recording “Dredd Song” for the film “Judge Dredd,” a cover of Bowie's “Young Americans” for an XFM album, and headlining several major European festivals, including the 25th Glastonbury. ""Wild Mood Swings"" was released in 1996, and went straight into almost every top ten around the world. The Cure hit the road once more with 'The Swing Tour', their longest to date, and released 4 more singles."
Eighth album.
"Galore, the follow up singles and video compilation to"" Standing On A Beach"", was released in 1997, after which work took place in 1998 on a variety of projects, including “More than This” for the “X Files” album, and a memorable appearance by Robert in “South Park” In 1999 the band completed the recording and mixing of what many regard as their best studio album so far, the Grammy Nominated"" Bloodflowers"". With its release in 2000 the band set off on the massive world-wide 'Dreamtour' - playing to more than a million people in 9 months."
Ninth album.
"2001 saw the long-awaited release of the Cure's “Greatest Hits” album, which featured all the band's biggest selling singles along with 2 new songs, the elegiac “Cut Here” and the ebullient “Just Say Yes,” a duet with Saffron. This year also saw the end of the group's relationship with Fiction Records, the label they had been instrumental in starting 23 years before."
Festivals in Europe.
"In 2002 the band spent the summer headlining a number of European festivals before going into rehearsals for two very special nights in November at the Tempodrom Berlin, where they performed all the tracks from ""Pornography, Disintegration"" and ""Bloodflowers"" plus encores. Both performances were shot in Hi-Def video on 12 cameras, and Trilogy DVD was released in 2003 as another chapter of The Cure story opened, the band signing a 3 album global deal with the Geffen label."
Tenth album.
"2004 saw the release of 'Join the Dots', a 4cd Boxset of all the B-sides and Rarities, followed by the widely acclaimed new album ‘The Cure’, and another hugely successful world tour."

Prison
"A prison or jail is a building where people are forced to live if their freedom has been taken away. The main use for prisons is as a punishment for breaking the law. Those who break the law and are convicted (found guilty) in court can receive a prison sentence, which is an order to spend an amount of time in prison. Prisons are usually run by the government."
"There are other reasons why someone might be held in prison. Sometimes, people can be held in prison before their trial (known as pre-trial detention or remand). In times of war, captured soldiers may become prisoners of war and civilians (non-soldiers) may be placed in an internment camp. In some countries, prisons are also used for political prisoners (people who disagree with the country's leader or government)."
"Other words for a prison include a gaol (pronounced like ""jail""), penitentiary or correctional facility. In the US, the words ""prison"" and ""jail"" mean separate things. A US ""jail"" is run by a local government and holds people who have not yet had their trial or who have been convicted for a minor crime. A US ""prison"" or ""penitentiary"" is run by the state or federal government and holds people who are serving a long sentence for a serious crime. Outside of North America, ""prison"" and ""jail"" mean the same thing. There are lots of slang words for prisons."
"In the United States and many other developed countries, inmates have most or all their personal possessions confiscated until release and are forced to wear prison uniforms."
Prison buildings and facilities.
Prisons are usually surrounded by walls and gates. There are usually many locked gates inside the prison to control the inmates.
"The inmates sleep in small locked rooms called cells. Cells have a bunk bed, a toilet, and a sink. Inmates are allowed to leave their cell every day for exercise. Some inmates work in the prison during the day, either in a factory or doing cooking or cleaning. Law enforcement officers called prison guards watch the inmates. The manager of a prison is called the warden (US, Canada), superintendent (some parts of the US, India) or governor (UK, Australia)."
"Prisons usually also include other buildings and facilities, such as a chapel, a library, an exercise yard, a gymnasium, an infirmary (small hospital), visiting rooms (for visits from family and lawyers), kitchens, and accommodation for prison staff."
"The level of security a prison has depends on the type of prison. A ""maximum security prison"" has even more protection than a regular prison. Some prisons in the United States have a section called ""death row"", where people who have been sentenced to death are kept in prison until their execution. On the other hand, an ""open prison"" is a prison where inmates can often travel out of the prison. These are used for prisoners who have been convicted of minor crimes, or who will soon be released."
"The United Nations made the ""Standard Minimum Rule"" for human treatment for prisoners in 1955. Also the Article 10 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights also affirm the treatment with humanity for them in prison. In some prisons, people imprisoned for child sexual abuse are separated from other prisoners for their own safety."
Purpose.
There are four main ideas about what prisons should be used for:
Pre-trial detention.
"A person who has been charged with a crime, but has not yet been convicted for it in a court, may be sent to prison if:"
"In some parts of the US, a person who is arrested may be held at a county jail until they decide whether to charge or release the person. In other places, a person who is arrested will be held at a police station, not a prison."
Special prisons.
"Male and female inmates are usually kept in separate locations, and often in separate prisons."
"There are special prisons for people under the age of 18 who commit crimes. These inmates are called young offenders or juvenile offenders. These places will not always have the word ""prison"" in their name, instead having names like ""Young Offenders' Institution""."
"While not called ""prisons"" most of the time, psychiatric hospitals often share characteristics with prisons, such as residents staying against their will and the various security measures implemented."
"A penal colony is a correctional facility operated in one country by the government of another. These were common during the 18th and 19th centuries when France, Spain, and Britain had colonies. Soviet gulags were a form of penal colony."
A labour camp is a simplified prison in which inmates are forced into manual labor. Prisoners tend to be accommodated in bunkhouses or barracks.
"Concentration camps (also called internment camps) are facilities for confining people without trial based on perceived threat, ethnicity, religion, etc."
Controversy.
Prisons are a controversial topic that people have different views about.
Reception.
"IGN rated the game a 9.1 out of 10 and said ""The hardcore fans will get plenty of enjoyment out of the difficult AI, the awesome multiplayer modes and the super deep Create-A-Wrestler mode.”"
"GameSpot gave the game a 6.5 out of 10 and stated ""While the game does some things very well, it generally falls short of expectations."""

Evolution (professional wrestling)
"Evolution is a professional wrestling stable that competes in the WWE. The stable was created on January 20, 2003 and broke up on October 3, 2005."
"The members of the stable were Triple H, Randy Orton, Batista and Ric Flair. Triple H acted as the leader and Flair acted as a mentor. The members of the stable each portrayed evolutions of professional wrestling with Ric Flair being ""the past"", Triple H being ""the present"" and Randy Orton and Batista being ""the future"". They all portrayed heels."
"On April 14, 2014, Evolution, not including Ric Flair, reunited. They came down to the ring to their theme ""Line in the Sand"" by Motörhead and attacked The Shield."
"On the June 2 episode of ""Raw"", Batista quit the WWE after he had his title match request denied by Triple H. Later in the night, Triple H said that he had a ""Plan B"" in his quest to destroy the Shield, which prompted Rollins to turn on and attack his group members Reigns and Ambrose."
Nôm
"Nôm is a script formerly used in Vietnam. It involved the use of Chinese characters to write Vietnamese. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, has the earliest known example of a Nôm inscription. The earliest surviving Nôm literature dates from the 13th century. The script was in common use until the 1920s. It was replaced by the Vietnamese alphabet. The Vietnamese alphabet is a form of the Latin alphabet."
"Classical Chinese was used by the royal court and for other official purposes. The Temple of Literature in Hanoi was the best-known school for the study of Chinese. Students who passed the civil service examinations could go on to become magistrates. Confucian scholars saw Chinese as the language of education and looked down on Nôm, while popular opinion favored Nôm. Only a small percentage of the population was literate in any language, but nearly every village had at least one person who could read Nôm."
"In Nôm, a Vietnamese word can be written using a Chinese character for a word with a similar meaning or pronunciation. Each character represents an idea. Such characters are called ""ideographs."" In addition, each character represents a syllable, or sound. Because traditional characters have this dual property, nearly every syllable in modern Vietnamese has acquired a semantic meaning. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. Since the issue of tone does not arise for Japanese or Korean, native phonetic scripts could develop for these languages without this complicating factor."
"Sino-Vietnamese characters were eventually displaced by an alphabetic script. Unlike alphabets used elsewhere, the Vietnamese alphabet has marks to indicate tone. In contrast to South Korea and Japan, modern Vietnam does not require students to study the traditional characters. Fewer than 100 scholars worldwide can read Nôm. Vietnamese literature written in Nôm, including classics like ""Tale of Kieu"" and the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong, can now be read only in translation. However, character calligraphy remains popular as a home decoration and as a symbol of good luck. The Han-Nom Institute, founded in 1970, collects and studies relevant manuscripts. The Nôm Ideographs were added to Unicode in 2001. Unicode is an international electronic encoding standard."
Language issues.
"Chinese characters are used to write various languages in China and elsewhere, including Mandarin, the most widely spoken language in China, Cantonese, spoken in Hong Kong and southern China, and Classical Chinese, traditionally used for formal writing. The characters were formerly used in Korea and in Vietnam. Japan uses a mix of Chinese characters and native phonetic script. Even characters that retain their original meaning in all languages may be read in various ways. The character 十 is given as ""shí"" in Chinese romanization (pinyin), ""jū"" in Japanese romanization (Hepburn), ""sip"" in Korean romanization (Revised Romanization), and ""thập"" in the Han-Viet system used in Vietnam. In all these languages, the meaning of the character is “ten.”"
Syntax.
"Modifiers normally come before the noun in Chinese, but follow the noun in vernacular Vietnamese. Chinese texts published in Vietnam often included a line-by-line translation into Nôm. Even when the same characters appear in both languages, the order is different. Many Chinese phrases gained currency as loan words. Later, the word order could be reversed to correspond to normal Vietnamese syntax. The word ""Vietnam"" is from Chinese ""Nányuè"" (南越), meaning “Southern Yue”. In Han-Viet, the same characters are read as . The word order was reversed in modern times. In Chinese, the phrase “Chinese characters” is written 漢字. This is romanized as ""hànzì"" in pinyin, kanji in Japanese, hanja in Korean, and in Han-Viet. In modern Vietnamese, they are ."
Character construction.
"The majority of the characters used in Nôm are of Chinese origin and are composed phonosemantically. For example, the character ""喃"" is read as ""Nôm"", whose phonetic component ""南"" similar to the Cantonese pronunciation ""Naam4"" and means “chattering.” This rule is consistent in all Chu Nôm characters as all Vietnamese made characters are composed using this method. The word ""Nôm"" does not have any negative connotation in Vietnamese, but rather suggests plain talk, something easy to understand."
"Nôm includes thousands of characters not found in Chinese. In contrast, Japan developed only a few hundred kokuji, Korea just a handful of rarely used gukja. These characters were created by authors who combined pre-existing elements. One element, called the ""semantic component"", indicates the character's meaning, either pictographically or ideographically. The other element, called the ""phonetic component"", gives pronunciation. For example, the reading ""ba"" is indicated by the character . In Mandarin, this character has the same pronunciation as in Vietnamese, but it's meaning is unrelated: ""to long for."" For the character (⿺巴三), the character 三 which means ""three"" is added as the semanic component. ""Father"" is also ""ba"", but written as (⿱父巴). ""Turtle"" is ""con ba ba"" (; ⿰虫巴). Most Chinese characters were created by the same method. As the correspondence between sound and meaning is compounded in Vietnamese created characters than it is in Chinese characters, the same approach resulted in two distinctions between Nôm characters; chữ Nôm (字喃; native characters) and Hán Nôm (漢喃; Han characters)."
"Of the 9,299 Nôm Ideographs, nearly half are specific to Vietnam. Each character has a codepoint assigned by Unicode. The characters for the V0, V1, and V2 sets were extracted from two Nôm dictionaries published in the 1970s. The V3 characters were extracted from manuscripts."
"Barrick Gold Corporation is an American mining company. They produces gold and copper with 16 operating sites in 13 countries. It is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It has mining operations in Argentina, Canada, Chile, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Dominican Republic, Mali, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Tanzania, the United States and Zambia. the company had 71 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves."
Barrick had been the world's largest gold mining company until Newmont Corporation acquired Goldcorp in 2019. Barrick expects to produce between 4.6 and five million ounces of gold and between 440 and 500 million pounds of copper in 2020.
Carbon footprint.
"Barrick Gold reported total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for 31 December 2020 at 7,351 Kt. It has set a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 30% and will be net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. At its operations in the United States, Barrick is transitioning away from coal to natural gas and solar power, in an effort to reduce emissions."
Mining practices.
"Environmental and human rights violations have taken place around a number of mining operations. They are now closed or were previously operated by a different company, including violence in Papua New Guinea and Tanzania. Forty people were arrested in Chile following a demonstration against the potential environmental impacts of a mining project. Executives of Acacia Mining had faced charges of bribery, conspiracy, forgery, money-laundering, tax-evasion and environmental damage. There has also been small groups of opposition in the Dominican Republic."

Twitter claimed that the mistake was made due to an error, and the account had been promoted with a link."
"Tate was first known as a far-right figure online due to his appearances on various right-wing sites, such as InfoWars and Jack Posobiec.He was described by The Independent's Rabbil Sikdar as a cult-like figure who is known for his anti-feminist views. Tate has called himself a and a sexist, and he has stated that women are merely ""long for the man"" and that if they accused him of being an unfaithful husband, he would attack them with a machete. The White , which is an organization that fights against male-on-male violence, considers his statements to be extremely . Hope Not Hate, an activist group that fights against fascism and racism, criticized Tate's social media presence, saying it could encourage the far-right audience to follow him. In response, Tate noted that his content mainly focuses on teaching his followers how to avoid being toxic and low-value individuals."
Criminal investigation.
"In a YouTube video that was later deleted, Tate stated that he moved to Romania because it was easier to get away with rape in Eastern Europe. However, in April 2022, his house was raided by the country's DIICOT, which is an investigative agency that focuses on terrorism and organized crime."

Biography.
Sino-Vietnamese characters
"Sino-Vietnamese characters () are Chinese-style characters read as either Vietnamese or as Sino-Vietnamese. When they are used to write Vietnamese, they are called Nôm. The same characters may be used to write Chinese. In this case, the character is given a Sino-Vietnamese, or Han-Viet, reading. Han-Viet is a system that allows Vietnamese to read Chinese. It is equivalent to pinyin in English."
"Some of these characters are also used in China; others are used only in Vietnam. Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam when the Han Empire invaded the country in 111 BC. Even after Vietnam became independent in AD 939, the country continued to use Classical Chinese () for official purposes. In the 1920s, Vietnam shifted from traditional characters to the Latin alphabet. The Han-Nom Institute was founded in Hanoi in 1970 to collect and study documents written in the traditional script. The institute has submitted a list of 19,981 Sino-Vietnamese characters to Unicode for electronic encoding. This includes a core set of 9,299 characters called the Nôm Ideographs."
History.
"Chinese characters were introduced to Vietnam after the Han Empire conquered the country in 111 BC. Independence was achieved in 939, but the Chinese writing system was adopted for official purposes in 1010. Soon after the country achieved independence, Vietnamese began to use Chinese characters to write their own language. The Van Ban bell, engraved in 1076, is the earliest known example of a Nôm inscription. Nguyen Thuyen composed Nôm poetry in the 13th century. However, none of his work has survived. The oldest surviving Nôm text is the collected poetry of King Tran Nhan Tong, written in the 13th century."
"Classical Chinese was used by the royal court and for other official purposes. The Temple of Literature in Hanoi was the best-known school for the study of Chinese. The civil service examination tested knowledge of Chinese. It was given once every three years. Students who passed the exam could go on to become magistrates. Confucian scholars saw Chinese as the language of education and looked down on Nôm. Popular opinion favored Nôm. Some kings thought that all writing should be done in Chinese. They suppressed Nôm. Other kings promoted Nôm. In 1867, King Tu Duc issued a decree encouraging the use of Nôm. Only a small percentage of the population was literate in any language. But nearly every village had at least one person who could read Nôm aloud for the other villagers. Jean-Louis Taberd wrote the first Nôm dictionary in 1838."
"In 1910, the colonial school system adopted a ""Franco-Vietnamese curriculum"", which emphasized French and alphabetic Vietnamese. The Vietnamese alphabet is a form of the Latin alphabet that includes tone marks. On December 28, 1918, King Khai Dinh declared that the traditional writing system no longer had official status. The civil service exam was given for the last time at the imperial capital of Hue on January 4, 1919. The examination system, and the education system based on it, had been in effect for almost 900 years. China itself stop using Classical Chinese soon afterward as part of the May Fourth Movement."
Language issues.
"Chinese characters are used to write various languages in China and elsewhere, including Mandarin, the most widely spoken language in China, Cantonese, spoken in Hong Kong and southern China, and Classical Chinese, traditionally used for formal writing. The characters were formerly used in Korea and in Vietnam. Japan uses a mix of Chinese characters and two native phonetic writing systems. Even characters that retain their original meaning in all languages may be read in various ways. The character 十 is pronounced as ""shí"" in Chinese romanization (pinyin), ""jū"" in Japanese romanization (Hepburn), ""sip"" in Korean romanization (Revised Romanization), and ""thập"" in the Han-Viet system used in Vietnam. In all these languages, the meaning of the character is “ten.”"
"The majority of the characters used in Nôm are of Chinese origin, chosen because they have an appropriate pronunciation or meaning. For example, the character used to write the word ""Nôm"" 喃 is pronounced ""nán"" in Chinese and means “chattering.” The fit between the Chinese character and the Vietnamese word is not always exact. The word ""Nôm"" does not have any negative connotation in Vietnamese, but rather suggests plain talk, something easy to understand."
"Nôm includes thousands of characters not found in Chinese. In contrast, Japan developed only a few hundred kokuji, most of them describing plants and animals found only in Japan. Korea had just a small number of rarely used gukja. These characters were created by writers who combined pre-existing elements. One element, called the radical, indicates the character's meaning, or at least a semantic category. The other element, called the remainder, gives pronunciation. This is similar to how most Chinese characters are written. Like Chinese, Vietnamese is a tonal language. In contrast, Japanese and Korean can be written in phonetic scripts that do not indicate tone."
Readings.
"When a character is read as Vietnamese, it is romanized according to its Nôm reading. When it is read as Chinese, it can be romanized into Vietnamese as Han-Viet, or into English as pinyin. The chart below uses a darker background to display the Nôm Ideographs (V0 to V3), considered to be the core Nôm character set."
Encoding.
"In 1994, the Ideographic Rapporteur Group agreed to include Sino-Vietnamese characters in Unicode. In 1993-2001, the Han-Nom Institute assembled a collection of 9,299 “Nôm Ideographs"" in four sets. These are the V0, V1, V2, and V3 characters shown below. A Sino-Vietnamese character is first assigned a V Source code, and later a codepoint. These codes are used to transmit and store the character electronically. An appropriate font must be installed to render them."
"The Nôm Ideographs were extracted from two dictionaries published in the 1970s, one in Saigon and the other in Hanoi. V Source annotations were added to the glyphs that were already encoded. The rest were assigned codepoints in Extension B. ""The Hán Nôm Coded Character Repertoire"" (2008) integrates the work of the Han-Nom Institute with that of the U.S.-based Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation. This book presents a comprehensive list of 19,981 Sino-Vietnamese characters, including the Nôm Ideographs, manuscript variants, characters formerly used by the Tay people of northern Vietnam, as well as numerous Chinese characters with Han-Viet readings."

Radio
"Radio is a way to send electromagnetic signals over a long distance, to deliver information from one place to another. A machine that sends radio waves is called a transmitter, while a machine that ""picks up"" the signals is called a receiver or antenna. A machine that does both jobs is a ""transceiver"". When radio signals are sent out to many receivers at the same time, it is called a broadcast."
Television also uses radio signals to send pictures and sound.
Airplanes and other things may be used under radio control. Radio signals can be used to lock and unlock the doors in a car from a distance.
"Sound can be sent by radio, sometimes through Frequency Modulation (FM) or Amplitude Modulation (AM)."
History of radio.
"Many people worked to make radio possible. After James Clerk Maxwell predicted them, Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in Germany first showed that radio waves exist. Guglielmo Marconi in Italy made radio into a practical tool of telegraphy, used mainly by ships at sea. He is sometimes said to have invented radio. Later inventors learned to transmit voices, which led to broadcasting of news, music and entertainment."
Uses of radio.
"Radio was first created as a way to send telegraph messages between two people without wires. Then two-way radio brought voice communication, including walkie-talkies and eventually mobile phones."
"Now an important use is to broadcast music, news and entertainers including ""talk radio"". Radio shows were used before there were TV programs. In the 1930s the US president started sending a message about the country every week to the American people. Companies that make and send radio programming are called radio stations. These are sometimes run by governments, and sometimes by private companies, who make money by sending advertisements. Other radio stations are supported by local communities. These are called community radio stations. In the early days manufacturing companies would pay to broadcast complete stories on the radio. These were often plays or dramas. Because companies who made soap often paid for them, these were called ""soap operas""."
"Radio waves are still used to send messages between people. Talking to someone with a radio is different than ""talk radio"". Citizens band radio and amateur radio use specific radios to talk back and forth. Policemen, firemen and other people who help in emergency use a radio emergency communication system to communicate (talk to each other). It is like a mobile phone, (which also uses radio signals) but the distance they reach is shorter and both people must use the same kind of radio."
"The word ""radio"" is sometimes used to mean only voiceband broadcasting. Most voiceband broadcasting uses lower frequency and longer wavelength than most television broadcasting."
"Microwaves have even higher frequency; shorter wavelength. They also are used to transmit television and radio programs, and for other purposes. Communications satellites relay microwaves around the world."
"A radio receiver does not need to be directly in view of the transmitter to receive programme signals. Low frequency radio waves can bend around hills by diffraction, although repeater stations are often used to improve the quality of the signals."
"Shortwave radio frequencies are also reflected from an electrically charged layer of the upper atmosphere, called the Ionosphere. The waves can bounce between the ionosphere and the earth to reach receivers that are not in the line of sight because of the curvature of the Earth's surface. They can reach very far, sometimes around the world."
"Radio telescopes receive radio waves from the sky to study astronomical objects. Satellite navigation uses radio to determine location, and radar uses it to find and track things."
Vandalism
Vandalism is a crime that is done by destroying or damaging the property of someone else. This can include graffiti and website damage.
"A person that does this is called a vandal. The name comes from the Vandals, a tribe that attacked and damaged the city of Rome in 455 CE."
Examples.
"Many websites, such as wikis (like Wikipedia), forums, and blogs, can be changed by anyone. Because of this, they can be ""vandalized"" by adding comments or replacing everything on the page with spam, nonsense or other silly content. It is a kind of trolling, and these websites have special users, called administrators, whose job is to remove the vandalism and to block users who do not stop vandalizing."
"Examples of physical vandalism include salting lawns, cutting trees without permission, egg throwing, breaking windows, arson, spraying paint on others' properties, tagging,"
Monopoly (game)
"Monopoly is a board game played by two to eight players. In the game, players move around the spaces of the board, buying and selling land and buildings to try to become the richest player. When all the other players run out of money, you win the game."
"Many books give advice on how to win the game. An early book, ""1000 Ways to Win Monopoly Games"" was written by Jeffrey S. Lehman (who later became President of Cornell University) and Jay S. Walker (founder of priceline.com.)"
History.
"""Monopoly"" was created by Elizabeth Magie as a teaching tool based on the economic concept of land monopoly. Magie created the game in 1903, to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. She wanted her game to be an educational tool to highlight the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. Her game, which she called ""The Landlord's Game"", was self-published, beginning in 1906. The original rules included several ways to play the game, including one where players could agree to share the land rents and everyone would win."
"In 1934, Charles Darrow in Philadelphia found The Landlord's Game and thought that the game was more exciting when players didn't share their land rents. He published his own version of the game where making money was the focus of the game, and called it ""Monopoly."" Later on, he sold his game to Parker Brothers, who falsely credited Charles Darrow as the creator of the game."
The Board.
"If Congress chooses, it can let the President, heads of executive departments, or the courts appoint less important officials on their own, without needing Congress's approval."
"Once the Senate gives advice and consent to the President (approves the President's choice for a job), and that person is given the job, the Senate cannot go back and change its mind. It cannot take away its advice and consent once the person gets the job."
"However, after the Senate grants advice and consent, the President ""can"" change his mind, and decide not to give the job to the person he nominated."
"It is not clear whether the President can fire a person who was hired with the advice and consent of the Senate. Congress has limited this power many times. For example, during the Reconstruction Era, President Andrew Johnson wanted to fire people that Congress had approved. Congress passed a law saying he could not do that, but Jackson ignored the law. Later, Congress impeached him, but the Senate did not convict him."
"A Supreme Court case called ""Bowsher v. Synar"" (1986) decided that Congress can fire a person it approved. Congress can do this by repealing the law that gave the President permission to appoint that person."
Clause 3: Recess appointments.
"Clause 3 has to do with Senate recesses (times when the Senate is not meeting). In the past, fast transportation was not available, and it could take a long time for members of Congress to get to Washington, D.C. Because of this, Congress would usually meet only during planned ""sessions,"" so everyone would have time to get there. After the planned sessions were over, the Senate would go into recess, and all the Senators would go home."
"During Senate recesses, the President may appoint officers to stand in for the missing Senators. However, these officers are temporary, and their permission to act as Senators expire (end) when the Senate finishes its next session."
Section 3: Presidential responsibilities.
Clause 1: State of the Union.
"Clause 1 of Section 3 is called the ""State of the Union Clause"". It says that ""from time to time,"" the President must give Congress information on the ""State of the Union."" (""State of the Union"" basically means ""The Situation in the United States."")"
"Originally, Presidents personally delivered State of the Union Addresses to Congress every year. Thomas Jefferson thought this was too much like a King speaking from a throne. Instead, he would send Congress written messages, and clerks (assistants) would read them. Other Presidents did the same for over 100 years, until President Woodrow Wilson went back to speaking in front of Congress. Every President since Wilson has kept doing that ."
"The purpose of the State of the Union is to make sure the President shares information with Congress, as well as the entire country. This information helps Congress decide whether anything is happening that they need to pass laws for. It also lets the people in the country know what is happening in their government."
Clause 2: Making recommendations to Congress.
"The President has the power to suggest to Congress anything he thinks is ""necessary [needed] and expedient [appropriate]"". This is called the ""Recommendation Clause""."
"The Recommendation Clause is another part of the checks and balances in the Constitution. The President cannot just do anything he thinks is needed; he has to get Congress's approval. If the President gives recommendations to Congress, Congress can approve them. However, if the President gives no suggestions to Congress, Congress has no power to force him to."
"Also, just by asking Congress, the President shows that he respects them as equals, and is not more powerful or important than they are, like a King would be. One scholar explains: ""The Recommendation Clause empowers the President to represent the people before Congress, by recommending measures for the reform of government, for the general welfare, or for the redress of grievances [for problems to be fixed].""p. 43"
Clause 3: Calling Congress into extraordinary session; adjourning Congress.
"Clause 3 gives the President the right to call one or both Houses of Congress ""on extraordinary Occasions."" This clause is meant to allow the government to act quickly in case a major emergency comes up when Congress is not in session. If the two Houses of Congress cannot agree on a date for when to adjourn a special session, the President may adjourn both Houses whenever he thinks it is appropriate."
"Presidents have called extraordinary sessions 27 times in history to deal with crises like wars or emergencies with the economy. The last time this happened was in 1948, when President Harry S Truman called a special session to try to get civil rights, Social Security, and health care laws passed."
"After airplane travel became common around the 1950s, Congress began meeting year-round. Since that time, no President has had to call a special session."
Clause 4: Receiving foreign representatives.
"The President receives (greets and hosts) all foreign Ambassadors. This clause of the Constitution is called the ""Reception Clause""."
Clause 5: Caring for the faithful execution of the law.
"The President must ""take care that the laws be faithfully executed [used and followed]."" This clause in the Constitution is sometimes called the ""Take Care Clause"", the ""Faithful Execution Clause,"" or the ""Faithfully Executed Clause""."
"This clause gives the President power, limits, and a duty, all at the same time:pp. 3–4"
Supreme Court cases have focused on the duties and limits the Take Care Clause puts on the President. For example:
Clause 6: Officers' commissions.
"The President commissions ""all the Officers of the United States."" (This means he gives these officers the power to do their jobs.) These include officers in both the military and foreign service (people who work for the United States government in other countries, like Ambassadors). However, Article One of the Constitution, Section 8, gives each state the power to appoint officers in their own militias."
Section 4: Impeachment.
"The Constitution also allows some government officials to be removed from office (fired). The President, Vice President, Cabinet Secretaries, and other executive officers, as well as judges, may be impeached by the House of Representatives, and then tried in the Senate."
"Anyone who is convicted by impeachment is fired immediately. The Senate may also choose to prevent the person from holding any federal office in the future. These are the only punishments that an impeachment proceeding can give. However, the person can still be tried for civil and criminal charges in the courts, and punished if they are found guilty."

Disney's Animal Kingdom
"Disney's Animal Kingdom is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort near Orlando, Florida, United States. It was the fourth park built there, and it opened on April 22, 1998. It is the largest Disney theme park in the world, covering more than . It is also the first Disney theme park to be themed around animal conservation, a philosophy once pioneered by Walt Disney himself. Disney's Animal Kingdom is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, meaning they have met or exceeded the standards in Education, Conservation and Research."
"Soon after the park opened, Disney advertised the park using the fictional word ""nahtazu"". It is pronounced ""not a zoo"". It was meant to state that the park is more than just a city zoo. Disney stopped using the word in January 2006."
"The symbol of Disney's Animal Kingdom is The Tree of Life, a sculpted 14-story (145-foot-tall []), tree. The tree is man-made. The leaves are made out of resin. Tourists can walk around the whole park to see all 325 animals carved in the bark of the tree."
"In 2009, the park had around 9.59 million guests, ranking it the fifth-most visited amusement park in the United States and eighth-most visited in the world."
Themed areas.
The park has eight themed areas.
Oasis.
"The Oasis is the park's main entrance. It has the guest services center and some animal habitats. Guests can see muntjacs, spoonbills, ducks, wallabies and giant anteaters, among others. The main paths lead into the park, and onto Discovery Island."
"A Rainforest Cafe is also at the entrance of the Oasis, but it is outside the park boundaries. Guests can eat at the restaurant without entering Disney's Animal Kingdom, while guests entering the restaurant from within the theme park are actually exiting the park and must show their tickets to go back into the park."
Discovery Island.
"Discovery Island is near the center of the park, in the middle of the Discovery River waterway. It was originally called Safari Village, as Discovery Island was the name for the small zoological park in Walt Disney World's Bay Lake. After it closed in 1999, Safari Village was renamed Discovery Island."
"This is the ""central hub"" of Disney's Animal Kingdom, connecting almost all of the other sections of the park, except Rafiki's Planet Watch. The Tree of Life, the park's icon, is here, surrounded by animal enclosures with kangaroos, black crowned cranes, lemurs and others. The park's largest gift shops and two of its major restaurants are on Discovery Island, each with a different design theme, such as decorations based on nocturnal animals, insects and so forth. The island's other major draw is ""It's Tough to be a Bug!"", a 4-D film starring Flik and Hopper from Disney·Pixar's ""A Bug's Life""."
Camp Minnie-Mickey.
"Camp Minnie-Mickey is themed as a summer camp. Here guests can meet the Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy and others. In the area's main theatre is ""Festival of the Lion King"", a live stage show featuring acrobatics and musical performances inspired by ""The Lion King""."
Africa.
"Set in the fictional east African village of Harambe, this area has many animal exhibits. Disney's story about Harambe is that it was once part of a Dutch colony, but a peaceful revolution made Harambe independent in 1963. Today, Harambe is the starting point for tourists and students who want to see Africa's animals in their natural habitats."
"The village is the namesake of the Harambe Wildlife Preserve, the fictional home of Africa's main attraction, Kilimanjaro Safaris. Guests board an open-sided safari vehicle for a trip to see African animals freely roam through acres of savanna, rivers and rocky hills, including giraffes, hippos, African elephants and lions. On the nearby Pangani Forest Exploration Trail, visitors go into the forest in search of gorillas. Along the way, guests go on a nature walk through an African valley filled with Nile hippos, birds and fish."
Rafiki's Planet Watch.
"The one section of the park not connected to Discovery Island, Rafiki's Planet Watch is instead connected to Africa. Guests board the Wildlife Express Train for the short trip to and from Planet Watch, which has three distinct areas. Guests first see ""Habitat Habit!"", where they can see cottontop tamarins and learn about the efforts to protect these endangered primates in their natural homes. Along the way, guests can also learn how to provide animal habitats in and around their own homes."
"""Conservation Station"" shares the conservation efforts supported by the Walt Disney Company. It also gives a behind-the-scenes look into Disney's Animal Kingdom's animal care facilities, including a veterinary examination room complete with a two-way communications system so the veterinary staff can answer guest questions. Outside, ""Affection Section"" is a petting zoo with goats, sheep and other domesticated animals."
Asia.
"Asia was the first area added to Disney's Animal Kingdom after the park opened. The Asia area opened in 1999. Like Africa, the section's attractions are part of a fictional place, the kingdom of Anandapur (which means ""Place of many delights""). Anandapur is made up of two villages: the riverside village of Anandapur and Serka Zong, which is in the foothills of the Himalayan Mountains. Portraits of Anandapur's royal family, the Maharajah and his wife, can be found in most of the businesses within the two villages, and a map of the kingdom, featuring both villages and their location relative to the mountains and river can be found on the wall of the Disney Vacation Club kiosk located there. Much like Harambe, Disney legend states that Anandapur is now a center of animal research and tourism. At the Caravan Stage, these two ""worlds"" meet in ""Flights of Wonder"", a live bird show where one of Anandapur's bird researchers educates a tour guide with a fear of birds about natural bird behaviors and the effects of habitat loss and conservation efforts on bird species, such as the Black Crowned Crane and American Bald Eagle."
"The Maharajah Jungle Trek leads guests through the forests and ruins outside the village, which are home to many animal species, such as Komodo dragons, fruit bats, tapirs, and tigers. Nearby, Kali River Rapids is a river rapids ride along the fictional Chakranadi River through a rainforest, past an illegal logging operation and down a waterfall. Behind Anandapur is the Forbidden Mountain, the home of Expedition Everest, a roller coaster ride through the Himalayas."
DinoLand U.S.A..
"DinoLand U.S.A. is inspired by the public's general interest in dinosaurs. The fictitious Dino Institute attracts those with a scientific interest in the long-extinct animals, while Chester and Hester's Dino-Rama recalls the many roadside attractions that were once scattered throughout the United States. Like the other areas of Disney's Animal Kingdom, there are animals on display."
"These animals, such as the American Crocodile and Asian brown tortoise, have evolutionary links to the age of the dinosaurs. Other plant and animal species that have survived since the dinosaur era can be found along the Cretaceous Trail. At the edge of DinoLand U.S.A. is the ""Theater in the Wild,"" which has ""Finding Nemo - The Musical"", a live-action musical stage show based on the story of the Disney·Pixar feature film."
"The Dino Institute is the home of DINOSAUR, a thrill ride trip through time to the Late Cretaceous Period. Just outside the Institute is ""Dino-Sue"", a casting of a ""Tyrannosaurus rex"" fossil that is the most complete dinosaur skeleton found so far. At the nearby Boneyard, children can play in a multi-leveled playground area with a mammoth fossil to be uncovered."
"Chester and Hester's Dino-Rama, on the other hand, is about dinosaurs as fun. The TriceraTop Spin is a colorful ride for families, while Primeval Whirl is a spinning roller coaster for thrill-seekers. Throughout the area are carnival games and gift shops, as well as chances to meet Disney characters."
The area was sponsored by McDonald's until 2009 when the contract ran out.
"It is a good idea to adopt a cat from a vet or an animal shelter. The vet, shelter or RSPCA will make sure they are healthy and spayed."
"Kittens are sometimes born with defects. People who receive cats as gifts are recommended to get it examined for its health. Some birth defects need attention. Others are harmless, like polydactyly. Polydactyly means many digits, or many ""fingers"" from poly (many) and dactyl (digit). Sometimes, there is a mutation (change) in cat families. Most cats have only four to five toes per paw, depending on whether it is the front or back paw. These mutated cats have six, seven, and in rare cases even more. All of these cats are called ""polydactyl cats"". They can also be called ""Hemingway cats"" because author Ernest Hemingway owned some of these cats."
Engineering
Engineering is the use of science and math to design or make things. People who do engineering are called engineers. They learn engineering at a college or university. Engineers usually design or build things. Some engineers also use their skills to solve technical problems. There are different types of engineers that design everything from computers and buildings to watches and websites. People have been creating and engineering things for thousands of years.
Specialties.
Engineering is a big subject. Here are a few of the many types of engineers:
"Engineers do not only work with machines. They also work a lot with other people. Many engineering projects are large and very complicated. Often different kinds of engineers work together and help each other. As an example, computer engineers need help from electrical engineers to build a computer. The computer needs programs written by software engineers. The computer could be used by aerospace engineers to control an airplane. An airplane is a big mechanical system with many parts, so a mechanical engineer and a systems engineer are also needed."
Study.
Most (but not all) engineers have had years of training. Much of their training involves working within a limited budget and materials.
American courses.
"In the United States, most engineers go to a college or university to get an engineering degree. Most people go to school for four years to get a bachelor's degree in engineering. A Master's Degree is an advanced degree, usually requiring two more years of study after the Bachelors. A person with a master's degree is eligible to enter a Doctoral program in engineering. A graduate of a Doctoral program is awarded a Doctor of Philosophy degree, which is commonly called a PhD. A PhD in engineering requires three or four years of study after a master's degree, and includes the completion of a long research report called a dissertation. After having gained enough work experience, one can sit for their Professional Engineer's (PE) License, reinforcing their demonstrated proficiency in their specialty."
British courses.
"In the United Kingdom, engineering degrees at universities are either three year BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) or four year MEng (Master of Engineering). In many universities it is common to take only one engineering discipline (e.g. aeronautical or civil engineering) although some universities have a general engineering degree. British universities may also offer Doctoral programs as a doctor of philosophy (PhD) or a doctor of engineering (EngD). Engineers of all disciplines have common approaches to solving problems including teamwork, communication, and an Iterative design process."
"Engineers can also get additional recognition in the form of becoming Chartered. A chartered engineer is one who has his degree or doctorate has been recognised by a group of professionals such as the IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology), IMechE (Institution of Mechanical Engineers), IChemE (Institution of Chemical Engineers) or ICE (Institution of Civil Engineers). Experience and responsibility enables a further step of recognition by becoming a Fellow of these institutions."
French courses.
"The best way to become an engineer in France is to take the CPGE (Classe Préparatoire pour les Grandes Écoles is the French class for engineer's school) for two years and then study for three years in an ""École d'Ingénieur"" (Engineer's school)."
"You can also study in an IUT (Institut universitaire technologique) for two years, and then study three years in an ""École d'Ingénieur""."
Communication
Communication is when information is passed from a sender to a recipient using a medium. There are different media that can be used:
"Communication can be spoken (a word) or non-spoken (a smile). Communication has many ways, and happens all the time. Not only humans communicate, most other animals do too. Some communication is done without thinking, such as by changing in posture."
Communication that tries to change somebody's mind may be called persuasion or propaganda.
How communication works.
Communication works by exchanging information or messages. In very basic terms
"Besides the content of the message, there are other things that are important. These are not part of the message itself, but rather of its context"
"For a message exchange to be successful, the sender and the recipient must have agreed on a vocabulary that avoids ambiguity. For example, the word ""hedge"" can mean completely different things based on the context. In botany a hedge is a row of shrubs or trees that make a barrier or form a border. In finance, a hedge is an investment made to reduce the risk of another investment. In linguistics a hedge is a word or set of words that make other words less important. Without information it is therefore very difficult to know which ""hedge"" is really meant by the speaker."
Miracle
"A Miracle is an amazing, beneficial event that goes (or at least seems to go) against natural laws. Some people say that a miracle is always an act brought about by God or other supernatural force (such as an angel). Others say that there can always be another explanation for it. And thirdly, some say the event is myth and never actually even happened in the first place."
According to the Bible.
"In the Bible a miracle is an act by God, where God's presence is shown. They can be an act that affects one person, or a gigantic disturbance of nature that changes the world."
"In Southern English, people use terms like ""ain't"", ""you was"",""fixin to"" (rather than ""going to""), ""been"" (rather than ""have been"") and ""that there""."
Features of most southern accents include
Varieties include
New York City English
"New York City English (also called New York English) is a regional dialect of American English. It is spoken by many people in New York City and the New York metropolitan area. The dialect is known through its use in media. It is most often used in New York City itself and its nearby suburbs. However, it is used all across the metropolitan area."
"The dialect is known for dropping the ""r"" in some words. For example, the word ""cart"" in New York sounds similar to ""cot"" or ""caught"". Some New York area people say ""tawk"" for ""talk""."
"There are many well known people and fictional characters who speak New York English. They include Archie Bunker, Bugs Bunny, Fran Drescher and Marisa Tomei."
Geomagnetic reversal
A geomagnetic reversal is a change in a planet's magnetic field such that the positions of magnetic north and magnetic south are interchanged.
"This has happened 183 times over the last 83 million years, averaging about two or three times per million years. Before a change of magnetic field, the Earth's magnetic field becomes weaker and moves around, like a spinning top would before it falls. Scientists know this as a result of studies of magnetism on the sea floor, near the mid-Atlantic ridge. The lava slowly moves out of this crevasse (gap in the sea floor) and then it cools with its iron oxide molecules all pointing in the new direction of the Earth's magnetic field. We can look at the history of this magnetic field today to look back at the many flips in the past."
"Reversals occur at intervals from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. These periods are called ""chrons""."
"There is no pattern to these changes, which seem to take place at random. Chrons last from between 0.1 and 1million years (see diagram) with an average of 450,000 years. Most reversals take between 1,000 and 10,000 years to happen."
"The latest one, the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred 780,000 years ago; and may have happened very quickly, within a human lifetime. A brief complete reversal, known as the Laschamp event, occurred only 41,000 years ago during the last glacial period. That reversal lasted only about 440 years with the actual change of polarity lasting around 250 years. During this change the strength of the magnetic field weakened to 5% of its present strength. Brief disruptions that do not result in reversal are called geomagnetic excursions."
Records of the past.
"The past record of geomagnetic reversals was first noticed by observing the magnetic stripe reversals on the ocean floor. This soon led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics. The relatively constant rate at which the sea floor spreads causes ""stripes"" in the basalt. From these past magnetic fields polarity can be inferred. Data is got by towing a magnetometer along the sea floor."
"No existing unsubducted sea floor is more than about 180 million years old, so other methods are used for detecting older reversals. Most sedimentary rocks have tiny amounts of iron rich minerals. Their orientation reflects the magnetic field when they formed. The rocks keep that record unless they get changed by some later process."
Superchrons.
"A ""superchron"" is a polarity interval lasting at least 10million years. There are two well-established superchrons, the Cretaceous Normal and the Kiaman."
"The Cretaceous Normal (also called the Cretaceous Superchron or C34) lasted for almost 40million years. Between the Cretaceous Normal and the present, the frequency has generally increased slowly."
"The Kiaman Reverse Superchron lasted from the late Carboniferous to the late Permian. That is more than 50million years, from 312 to 262 million years ago (mya). The magnetic field had reversed polarity. The name ""Kiaman"" derives from the Australian village of Kiama, where some of the first geological evidence of the superchron was found in 1925."
Causes.
"The magnetic field of the Earth, and of other planets that have magnetic fields, is caused by dynamo action of molten iron in the planetary core. This convection (movement) generates electric currents which in turn give rise to magnetic fields. In simulations of planetary dynamos, reversals occur from the underlying dynamics. For example, Gary Glatzmaier and collaborator Paul Roberts of UCLA ran a numerical model of the coupling between electromagnetism and fluid dynamics in the Earth's interior. Their simulation reproduced key features of the magnetic field over more than 40,000 years of simulated time and the computer-generated field reversed itself. Global field reversals at irregular intervals have also been observed in a laboratory liquid metal experiment VKS2."
Effects on life.
"As far as we know, there is no effect on life. Studies have been done to see if reversals relate in any way to extinction events. Statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between reversals and extinctions."
Chron
"A chron is a general term in Earth science. It means a period of time, usually less than a million years."
Economic deficit
"Economic deficit is a status of financial health in which expenditures exceed revenue (more money being spent than coming in). The term ""budget deficit"" is most commonly used to refer to government spending rather than business or individual spending. When referring to accrued federal government deficits, the term ""national debt” is used."
"Manama, Bahrain's capital city, is as modern as other cities in the world. But life in the island's many villages (and in parts of Manama itself) remains traditional. Where there is tradition in the Persian Gulf area, there is Islamic conservatism: women cover themselves from head to foot and women travellers are expected to wear long skirts and one-piece bathing suits. Bahrain's population is 85% Muslim and Islam is the state religion. Arabic is the official language, but many people speak English."
"Traditional folk art continues in several places around Bahrain: dhows (fishing boats) are built near Manama and Muharraq, cloth is made at Bani Jamrah and pottery is made at A'ali. A few goldsmiths still work in the Manama souk, though much of the work is now done in other countries. One of the important parts of Bahraini culture is the drinking of traditional Arabian coffee. Traditional Arabian street food like shawarma (lamb or chicken cut from a large spit and served in pita bread) and desserts such as baklava are also found."
Formula One.
"Bahrain is the home of Formula One racing in the Middle East, hosting the Bahrain Grand Prix."
William Christopher
"William Christopher (October 20, 1932 – December 31, 2016) was an American actor. He was best known for playing Father Mulcahy on the television series ""M*A*S*H"". He also played Private Lester Hummel on ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C."""
"Christopher was born in Evanston, Illinois. He studied at Wesleyan University. His wife was Barbara O'Connor; together they wrote a book, ""Mixed Blessings"", about their experiences raising their autistic son. He retired in 2012."
"Christopher died on December 31, 2016 in Pasadena, California from small-cell carcinoma, aged 84."
Boxer shorts
"Boxer shorts are men's underwear. They are shorts with a stretchy band, and named after the shorts worn by boxers."
"They were first made in the 1930s, but did not become popular until 1947. These days, briefs (Y-fronts) are sold more than boxer shorts."
Some boxer shorts have openings with a snap button for using the toilet (urinating). Others just have an elastic waistband and can be pulled on or off like briefs. They can be made in different colors or patterns. Television displays more men in boxer shorts than in other underwear.
Compact disc player
A CD player is a device that can read the binary data on a CD (compact disc) and turn that into sound waves.
"A CD player has a laser and an optical sensor. A CD has tracks and bumps on the tracks. The CD player passes a laser beam along the track of the CD. The areas that are reflected (without the bumps) are 1s to the player and the areas that are reflected (with the bumps) are 0s to the player. When the 1's and 0's are added to the CD a complicated coding is used that enables error corrections to prevent the CD ""skipping"" in the event of a small scratch. The CD player converts the series of 1's and 0's into sound waves by sending a varying voltage into an amplifier which then drives a speaker. The conversion of digital data into an analogue signal is achieved through the use a matrix(maths not the movie), imaginary numbers and trigonometric functions."
Fluid dynamics
"Fluid Dynamics talks about how fluids (liquids and gases) work. It is one of the oldest parts of the study of Physics, and is studied by physicists, mathematicians, and engineers. Mathematics can describe how fluids move using mathematical formulas called equations. The fluid dynamics of gases are called aerodynamics."
"Understanding how fluids behave helps us understand things like flight or ocean currents. For example, fluid dynamics can be used to understand weather, because clouds and air are both fluids. Fluid dynamics can also be used to understand how aeroplanes fly through the air or how ships and submarines move through water."
"Computer programs can use the mathematical equations of fluid dynamics to model and predict the actions of moving fluids. Computers have helped us understand fluid dynamics very much, and some people study how to model or simulate fluids only with a computer. Studying how fluid dynamics can be done with computers is called computational fluid dynamics (or CFD for short)."
Important equations in fluid dynamics.
The mathematical equations that govern fluid flow are simple to think about but very hard to solve. In most real life cases there is no way to get a solution that can be written down and a computer must be used to calculate the answer instead. There are three fundamental equations based on three rules.
"Conservation of mass: mass is neither created nor destroyed, it simply moves from one place to another. This gives the mass conservation equation. Sometimes this may not apply such as a flow involving a chemical reaction."
"Conservation of energy: this is the first law of thermodynamics, energy is never created or destroyed, it just changes form (i.e. kinetic energy into potential energy) or moves around."
"Conservation of momentum: this is Newton's Second Law and it states that Force = rate of change of momentum. Momentum is mass times velocity. The momentum equations are the equations that make it hard to solve problems in fluid dynamics. There are a number of different versions that include a number of different effects. The Navier-Stokes equations are momentum equations, and the Euler equations are the Navier-Stokes equations but with viscosity not included. There is one momentum equation in a 1D problem and three, one in each space direction, in 3D."
"To solve the equations more information is often needed in the form of an equation of state. This relates thermodynamic properties (usually pressure and temperature) to each other for a specific type of fluid. An example is the ""Ideal Gas"" equation of state that relates pressure, temperature and density and works well for gases under normal pressures (like air at atmospheric pressure)."
Ernest Hemingway
"Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 - July 2, 1961) was an American writer. He wrote in a very simple way, which made him very popular. He also did many exciting things, which made many people respect him. He is usually thought to be a member of the Lost Generation."
"A common cause of thermal pollution is using water as a coolant by power stations and industrial manufacturers. This puts back warm water, and so raises the temperature and decreases how much oxygen is in the water. The heat released into the air will make the air warmer which increase global warming."
Immunity (medical)
"Immunity is the ability of the body to defend itself from 'foreign bodies'. This means rejecting infections, clearing up dust which gets in the lungs, and killing cancer cells."
"Immunity is of two types. Innate immunity protects the host against infection, but has no 'memory', and so gives no long-term immunity."
"The second type is adaptive immunity, which does have a kind of 'memory'. It does give long-term protection against specific pathogens."
"All animals, plants and fungi have some innate immunity. Vertebrates also have adaptive immunity."
People can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination
"(injection of some dead or weakened virus, or bacteria that causes the disease). By doing so, the body learns how the virus/bacteria harms the body, and will react more quickly to fight the virus/bacteria when it comes in contact with the virus/bacteria again. When your body has defended itself against the virus/bacteria it will trap the certain virus/bacteria in a ""net"" so when the virus/bacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those viruses/bacteria as well."
History of immunology.
Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease.
The earliest known mention of immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.
"In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom."
"This and other observations of acquired immunity was later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory."
"It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed."
"Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral immunity (antibodies) and cellular immunity (T cells and dendritic cells)."
"Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Mechnikov."
Humoral immunity.
"Humoral immunity is immunity that is done by macromolecules. Antibodies, complement proteins, and certain antimicrobial peptides are in extracellular fluids."
Cell-mediated immunity.
"This is an immune response which does not involve antibodies. Cell-mediated immunity is the activation of phagocytes, antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, and the release of various cytokines in response to an antigen."
Roman numerals
"Roman numerals are a numeral system that was used by ancient Rome. Numbers in this system use letters from the Latin alphabet. Currently, it uses seven symbols:"
"The Europeans still used Roman numerals even after the fall of the Roman Empire. From the 14th century, the Europeans replaced Roman numerals with Arabic numerals. However, people still use Roman numerals to this day."
"One place in which they are sometimes seen is on clock faces (the front of a clock). For example, on the clock of Big Ben, the hours from 1 to 12 are written as:"
"The and can be read as ""one less than 5"" (4) and ""one less than 10"" (9). On many clocks that use Roman numerals, however, 4 is written as ."
Subtraction rule.
"Instead of writing the same letter four times, a rule for subtraction is used. The letter is written once, then the next largest Roman numeral is written. When a lower number (such as ) appears before a higher one (such as ), the lower number is subtracted from the higher one. For example, 4 is not written as , but instead as , because is (5) minus (1). The same is done for 9 - it is not written as , but instead as , because is (10) minus (1)."
Example.
"It is very easy to write a number as a Roman numeral. Simply subtract the largest possible Roman numeral as many times as possible from the number. This system will result in a valid Roman numeral, but will not take the subtraction rule into account."
"Getting the number from the numeral is equally simple, by adding the values of the symbols."
"In 1951, six countries made the ""European Coal and Steel Community"", a basic version of what the EU is now. These six then went further and in 1957 they made the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community. The UK and others decided not to join, and then when the UK changed its mind it was stopped from joining by French President Charles de Gaulle. When he was no longer President, the UK and others started to join. Today there are 27 members but the idea that more should join is not seen as a good one by everyone."
"Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Turkey and Iceland are ""candidate countries""; they are being considered for membership. Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are expected to follow."
"However, since there have been many political problems happening in Turkey recently, especially with President Edrogan's arresting of tens of thousands of political rivals since the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016, it is unlikely that it would be allowed to part of the EU anytime soon because EU members believe that the current Turkish government is not respecting human rights, rule of law, or democracy."
Motto.
"United in diversity (or ""together with many types of people"" in Simple English), is the motto of the European Union."
The motto in other languages:
Brexit.
"On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on whether it should stay in the EU or leave it. The majority [52% to 48%] favored leaving. Britain leaving the EU is commonly known as Brexit."
"The government of the UK invoked ""Article 50"" of the Treaty of European Union (the Treaty of Lisbon) on 29 March 2017. This began negotiations with fellow members of the EU on the terms of exit. The timetable for these negotiations is two years, which meant that the UK would remain a member of the EU until at least March 2019. However this deadline was later extended to October 31st 2019 at the request of the British Government. The United Kingdom left the European Union on the 31 of January 2020 at 23:00 (Greenwich Mean Time). Following the UK left from the European Union on January 31, the transition period expired on December 31, 2020 and ended on January 1, 2021."
Greece
"Greece ( or ), officially the Hellenic Republic ( ), (historically known as Hellas) (Greek: Ελλάς), is a country in Southeastern Europe. Its capital city is Athens."
"It borders Albania, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the east. The Aegean Sea is to the East and South of mainland Greece, the Ionian Sea is to the West. Both are part of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and have many islands. 80% of the country is mountainous, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak."
"Ancient Greece created democracy, philosophy, science and mathematics, drama and theater and the Olympic Games. This is why other languages use many Greek words."
"Greece is a parliamentary republic, in which the leader of the party with more seats in the parliament is the Prime Minister. The country has a President, but his powers are ceremonial. He is the head of state, not the head of government, much like how Kings and Queens operate in constitutional monarchies and is elected by Parliament and not the people. Its economy is the highest in the Balkans region, though facing financial difficulties due to a Greek government-debt crisis. The country was under occupation by the Ottoman Empire until 1821."
Greece is known for its rich history.
The Macedonia region in Greece was the ancient kingdom of Macedonia (sometimes called Macedon).
"It was the empire of Alexander the Great. Ancient Greece was made up of a number of city-states, each with its own constitution. Athens, Sparta and Corinth are examples of city-states."
"The official language spoken in Greece is Greek, spoken by 99% of the population and 90% of the population as well as the Republic of Cyprus. It identifies as Christian Orthodox. Many Greeks also understand English, French and German, which are taught in schools. Greece was a founding member of the United Nations, joined NATO in 1952, became a member of the European Union in 1981, and adopted the Euro in 2001. Due to the large tourism industry, powerful shipping sector, and its geostrategic importance, it is sometimes classified as a middle power."
History.
"Greece's history is one of the richest in the world. The Greeks were one of the most advanced civilizations. Greece is famous for its many philosophers, like Plato and Aristotle, and kings like Alexander the Great and Leonidas. Greece is said to be the ""birthplace of Democracy"", because city-states like Athens, now the capital of Greece, were the first to elect their leaders and not have kings. During the years of Alexander the Great, a huge Greek Macedonian empire was created that stretched from modern-day Greece to Egypt and Iran, until the borders of India. Because of the significant role that Greek culture played during that time, it is called the Hellenistic period (or ""Greek-dominated period""). During that time, the Greek language became the 'lingua franca' of the Middle East, which means the language that people who do not speak the same language use to communicate, like English is used today as an international language."
"Greece was then ruled by the Roman Empire, and many argue that Rome conquered Greece with its army, but Greece conquered Rome with its culture. The Roman Empire after the conquest of Greece became a civilization known as the Greco-Roman (or Greek-Roman) civilization. When the Roman Empire collapsed, the Greeks emerged as the ruling class of the Byzantine Empire, and the Greek language became the official language of the empire, which included all the territories around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. It was then occupied by the Ottoman Empire for a period of 400 years. Some areas of Greece, like the second-largest city in the country, Thessaloniki, were occupied for 500 years and became part of Greece in the early 20th century."
"The Greek War of Independence began in 1821 and Greece was an independent country (a republic) in 1828. In 1832 Greece was made a kingdom by the United Kingdom and Russia, under the German Wittelsbach dynasty."
"In 1912, Greece took part in the Balkan Wars, where it gained many of the territories that make up the country now, such as Greek Macedonia and the islands of the Aegean Sea. Greece fought in both World War I and World War II in the side of allies. During World War I, Greece was divided into two countries, the State of Thessaloniki in the north and the State of Athens in the south. Both countries claimed to be the legitimate government of Greece, but the State of Thessaloniki received support from the Allies. The country was reunited in 1917 when the King abdicated. In 1920 Greece expanded again and briefly reached its maximum size. The territories that the country had gained in Turkey were given back to Turkey in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, but Greece kept Western Thrace. The king returned in 1935, and Greece was under a fascist dictatorship from 1936 until 1941, friendly to the Allies when it was invaded by Nazi Germany."
"Greece’s Macedonia region is known for its rich history, The ancient kingdom of Macedonia (sometimes called Macedon) was Alexander the Great's empire."
"In 1940, Greece was invaded by Italy, but defeated the invasion. This was the first victory of an Allied country against an Axis power. After this, Hitler decided to attack Greece sooner than he had planned. Germany invaded on 6 April 1940 and captured Greece's second-largest city of Thessaloniki on 9 April, while Athens was captured on 27 April. Most fighting ended with the Battle of Crete. Greece suffered major damages in the war."
"Between 1946 and 1949, the Greeks fought a civil war. The fighting was between the communists and the people who supported the king, who also had support from the United Kingdom and the United States. The war left the country devastated and the people very poor."
"In 1967 the military took control of the country and restricted democracy. Free elections were then held again 7 years later, and the Greeks voted to send the king away and declared a republic in 1974. Greece became a member of the European Union in 1981. Greece had seen rapid growth in the 1990s, but some of the country's economic statistics were modified to appear more correct than they were, as the government had lied with the help of banks from the United States. In 2004, Greece hosted the Olympic Games for a second time. Since 2009, Greece has been in an economic crisis, which is also becoming a political crisis."
Politics.
"It is not a federal state like the United States, but a unitary state like the United Kingdom. It is ruled by a parliament, called the ""Hellenic Parliament"" (or ""Greek Parliament"" in Simple English), which has 300 members. It is a parliamentary republic, which means that, unlike in the United States, the President has very few powers. The person in charge of the government of Greece is the Prime Minister."
"Greece was a kingdom for most of its history as an independent nation. It officially became the ""Third Hellenic Republic"" (or ""The Third Republic of Greece"" in Simple English) in 1975, when the monarchy was abolished by a popular vote."
"Greece was under a military dictatorship between 1966 and 1975. Demonstrations by the students of the universities across Greece took place in 1973 but were suppressed by the regime, which forcibly stopped the protests. The dictatorship collapsed after the invasion of Cyprus and handed over power to Constantine Karamanlis."
Legume family.
"Plants that contribute to nitrogen fixation include the legume family – Fabaceae – with taxa such as kudzu, clovers, soybeans, alfalfa, lupines, peanuts, and rooibos. They have symbiotic bacteria called ""Rhizobia"" in nodules in their root systems, producing nitrogen compounds that help the plant to grow and compete with other plants. When the plant dies, the fixed"
"nitrogen is released, making it available to other plants and this helps to fertilize the soil. Most legumes have this association, but a few genera (e.g., ""Styphnolobium"") do not. In traditional farming practice, fields are rotated through various types of crops, which usually includes one consisting mainly or entirely of clover or buckwheat (non-legume family ""Polygonaceae""), which are often referred to as ""green manure""."
Non-leguminous.
"Although most plants able to form nitrogen-fixing root nodules are in the legume family Fabaceae, there are a few exceptions:"
"All these families belong to the orders Cucurbitales, Fagales, and Rosales, which together with the Fabales form a clade. In this clade, Fabales were the first lineage to branch off; thus, the ability to fix nitrogen was lost in most descendants of the original nitrogen-fixing plant."
Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Hermann Hellnegel (18311895) and Martinus Beijerinck (18511931).
Britské listy
"Britské listy is an Internet cultural and political daily published in the Czech Republic. It specialises in critical analysis of Czech politics; some Czech commentators consider this as ""left-wing views"". It is editorially open and will publish stimulating pieces by authors from any part of the political spectrum"
Nitrogen cycle
The nitrogen cycle is the way that nitrogen in nature is changed into many different forms that are used by living organism[s].
"Air is about 78% nitrogen. Nitrogen chemicals are needed for life. Nitrogen is a necessary part of proteins, DNA, and RNA. In plants, nitrogen is needed for photosynthesis and growth. However, living things cannot use the elemental nitrogen in the air for these things. Nitrogen fixation is needed to change the nitrogen in air (N2) into forms that can be used by life. Most nitrogen fixation is done by microorganisms called bacteria. These bacteria have an enzyme that combines N2 with hydrogen gas (H2) to make ammonia (NH3)."
"Some of these bacteria live in the roots of plants (mostly legumes). In these roots, they make ammonia for the plant and the plant gives them carbohydrates. Other plants take nitrogen compounds out of the soil through their roots. All nitrogen in animals comes from eating plants."
"Ammonium (NH4) in soil is made by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and decomposers, bacteria and fungi that break down dead life into its parts. This process is called ""ammonification"". Ammonium has a positive charge. It easily joins to clay and humus in the soil. Ammonia and ammonium are poisonous to fish and other animals. Sewage and other waste-water is regularly measured because of this. If ammonia levels are too high, ""nitrification"" must happen."
Nitrification is the oxidation of ammonia and ammonium to nitrite (NO2−) and then to nitrate ( NO3−) by bacteria. Because nitrite and nitrate have a negative charge they do not easily join to soil and will wash out of the soil during rain and irrigation. High nitrate levels in drinking water is harmful for babies and can cause blue-baby syndrome. High nitrate levels can also cause too much algae growth in lakes and pools. This eutrophication can be harmful to fish and other water animals. The use of fertilizers is controlled because of this.
"Where there is no oxygen, some bacteria will make nitrate into nitrogen gas (N2) to extract energy. This starts the nitrogen cycle over again. This process is called ""denitrification""."
Moscow State University
"Lomonosov Moscow State University (MSU; ), also known as Moscow State University, is the largest and oldest university in Russia. It was made in 1755 and is in Moscow. It was made by Ivan Shuvalov and Mikhail Lomonosov. It is named after Lomonosov."
"The university building is an example of Stalinist architecture. In total, there are seven such towers around Moscow. The tower at the university is the largest one. The tower was designed by architect Lev Vladimirovich Rudnev. It was built after the war. He was awarded the Stalin Prize for its construction, in 1949. The building was the largest skyscraper outside New York for a long time. It was the tallest buildimg in Europe, until 1988. The central tower is 240m high. It has 36-stories. It is flanked by four huge wings of student and faculty accommodations. It is said to contain a total of 33 kilometers of corridors and 5,000 rooms. Facilities that are inside the building include a concert hall, a theatre, a museum, various administration services, a library, a swimming pool, a police station, a post office, a laundry, a hairdresser's salon, a canteen, bank offices, shops, cafeterias, and a bomb shelter. Along with the university administration, four of the main faculties - Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Geology, the Faculty of Geography, and the Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts - now are in the Main building. The star on the top of the tower is large enough so that it has a small room and a viewing platform; it weighs 12 tons. The building's facades are decorated with giant clocks, barometers, and thermometers, statues, carved wheat sheaves, and Soviet crests (recently renovated). It stands before a terrace featuring statues of male and female students gazing optimistically and confidently into the future."
Boarding school
"A boarding school is a school where students live and sleep. Some boarding schools have day students who go home at the end of the school day. If the school costs money, they don't have to pay as much money. A person who stays at a boarding school is called a ""boarder"". In the UK 1% of children go to boarding schools and 13% of private school pupils are boarders. Most boarding schools are private. This means that as well as having to pay to sleep there, students have to pay for their education."
In Ghana most secondary schools are boarding.
"Famous private boarding schools include Eton College, Rugby School and Harrow School in the United Kingdom, Phillips Exeter Academy in the United States and Cornway College in Zimbabwe."
"There are therapeutic boarding schools which offer treatment for psychological difficulties. Special needs education for children are catered for in some boarding schools. Some boarding schools offer 'democratic education', such as Summerhill School (where pupils make many of the decisions). Others are determinedly international, such as the United World Colleges. Military schools or academies provide discipline and may offer a way into military service. Gordonstoun in Scotland is a co-educational school for both day and boarding pupils."
"Some famous novels use boarding schools as their setting. Examples include the"" Harry Potter"" series by J.K. Rowling;"" A Little Princess"" by Frances Hodgson Burnett; ""The Catcher in the Rye ""by J.D. Salinger;"" the Malory Towers, St. Clare's ""and ""The Naughtiest Girl ""series"" ""by Enid Blyton; and ""Nicholas Nickleby ""by Charles Dickens."
Sacha Baron Cohen
"Sacha Noam Baron Cohen (born 13 October 1971) is an English comedian, writer and actor. He was born in Hammersmith in London."
American English.
To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in American English:
"In standard, written, American English, the word ""and"" is ""not"" in the word-name of any whole number even though many speakers insert it."
Examples:
British and Commonwealth English.
To write a whole number from 100 to 999 in British and Commonwealth English:
"In standard, written, British English (and the English spoken in many other places), the word ""and"" ""is"" in the word-name of many whole numbers."
Examples:
United States dollar
"The United States dollar (or American dollar) is the official currency (money) of the United States of America. It is also used in some . It is the standard currency for international markets selling goods such as gold and oil (petrol). When writing, the symbol for the American dollar is the dollar sign ($). Dollars can also be known as USD (standing for 'U.S. dollar')."
Denominations and value.
"The American one dollar bill has a picture of George Washington. There are currently paper bills (currency) of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollars."
"All U.S. dollar currency has been the same size, shape and general design since 1928. This is unlike some countries where bank notes with different values have different sizes."
"The U.S. also has dollar coins. Some are silver colored and some are gold colored. Vending machines often give dollar coins as change, since it is easier for the machines to give out coins than paper money. Some of the more advanced vending machines give out paper money as change. Paper dollars are much more common than dollar coins."
"The US dollar in subdivided into cents, and 100 cents equals 1 US dollar. One cent can be written as either $0.01 or 1¢. The cent or ""penny"" (not to be confused with the English penny sterling) is the least worth coin used in the U.S.. There are several different coins with different cent values of different materials and sizes. There is the penny (1¢ or $0.01), nickel (5¢ or $0.05), dime (10¢ or $0.10), quarter (25¢ or $0.25), and the much rarer half-dollar (50¢ or $0.50). All coins and paper bills have the faces of famous Americans on the front side."
Federal Reserve.
"The paper ""dollar bill"" is actually called a ""Federal Reserve Note"". Federal Reserve notes are legal tender currency notes. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks issue them into circulation pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. A commercial bank belonging to the Federal Reserve System can obtain Federal Reserve notes from the Federal Reserve Bank in its district whenever it wishes by paying for them in full, dollar for dollar, from its account with Federal Reserve Bank."
Federal Reserve Banks get the notes from the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP). It pays the BEP for the cost of producing the notes.
Congress has specified that a Federal Reserve Bank must hold collateral equal in value to the Federal Reserve notes that the Bank receives. This collateral is chiefly gold certificates and United States securities. This provides backing for the note issue.
"Federal Reserve notes are not redeemable in gold, silver or any other commodity, and receive no backing by anything. This has been the case since 1933. The notes have no value for themselves, but for what they will buy."
"The Coinage Act of 1965 titled ""Legal tender"" states: ""United States coins and currency (including Federal reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal reserve banks and national banks) are legal tender for all debts, public charges, taxes, and dues""."
"This statute means that all United States money as identified above are a valid and legal offer of payment for debts when tendered to a creditor. There is no Federal statute saying a person or organization ""must"" accept currency or coins as payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash. But there might be a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy."
Meeting the variable demand for cash.
"The public typically obtains its cash from banks by withdrawing cash from automated teller machines (ATMs) or by cashing checks. The amount of cash that the public holds varies seasonally, by the day of the month, and even by the day of the week. For example, people demand a large amount of cash for shopping and vacations during the year-end holiday season. Also, people typically withdraw cash at ATMs over the weekend, so there is more cash in circulation on Monday than on Friday."
"To meet the demands of their customers, banks get cash from Federal Reserve Banks. Most medium- and large-sized banks maintain reserve accounts at one of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, and they pay for the cash they get from the Fed by having those accounts debited. Some smaller banks maintain their required reserves at larger, ""correspondent,"" banks. The smaller banks get cash through the correspondent banks, which charge a fee for the service. The larger banks get currency from the Fed and pass it on to the smaller banks."
"When the public's demand for cash declines—after the holiday season, for example—banks find they have more cash than they need and they deposit the excess at the Fed. Because banks pay the Fed for cash by having their reserve accounts debited, the level of reserves in the nation's banking system drops when the public's demand for cash rises; similarly, the level rises again when the public's demand for cash subsides and banks ship cash back to the Fed. The Fed offsets variations in the public's demand for cash that could introduce volatility into credit markets by implementing open market operations."
"The popularization of the ATM in recent years has increased the public's demand for currency and, in turn, the amount of currency that banks order from the Fed. Interestingly, the advent of the ATM has led some banks to request used, fit bills, rather than new bills, because the used bills often work better in the ATMs."
Maintaining a cash inventory.
"Each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks keeps an inventory of cash on hand to meet the needs of the depository institutions in its District. Extended custodial inventory sites in several continents promote the use of U.S. currency internationally, improve the collection of information on currency flows, and help local banks meet the public's demand for U.S. currency. Additions to that supply come directly from the two divisions of the Treasury Department that produce the cash: the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints currency, and the United States Mint, which makes coins. Most of the inventory consists of deposits by banks that had more cash than they needed to serve their customers and deposited the excess at the Fed to help meet their reserve requirements."
"When a Federal Reserve Bank receives a cash deposit from a bank, it checks the individual notes to determine whether they are fit for future circulation. About one-third of the notes that the Fed receives are not fit, and the Fed destroys them. As shown in the table below, the life of a note varies according to its denomination. For example, a $1 bill, which gets the greatest use, remains in circulation an average of 5.9 years; a $100 bill lasts about 15 years."
"Rommel asked Hitler for command of a panzer division. On 6 February 1940, three months before the invasion of France, Rommel was given command of the 7th Panzer Division, for ""Fall Gelb"" (""Case Yellow""), the invasion of France and the Low Countries. Some other officers did not agree with his promotion. Rommel's initial request for command had been rejected by the Chief of Army Personnel, who cited his lack of previous experience with armoured units and his extensive prior experience in an Alpine unit made him a more suitable candidate to assume command of a mountain division that had recent need to fill its commanding-officer post. Rommel had, however, emphasized the use of mobile infantry and recognized the great usefulness of armoured forces in the Poland campaign. He set about learning and developing the techniques of armoured warfare with great enthusiasm. The decision to place him in command of an armoured division was borne out to be an excellent one. In May, 1940 his 7th Panzer Division became known as the ""Ghost Division"" because its rapid advances and fast-paced attacks often placed them so far forward that they were frequently out of communication with the rest of the German army."
North Africa 1941–1943.
"Rommel's reward for his success was to be promoted and appointed commander of the 5th Light Division (later reorganised and redesignated ""21.Panzer-Division"") and of the ""15.Panzer-Division"" which, as the ""Deutsches Afrikakorps,""() were sent to Libya in early 1941 in Operation Sonnenblume to aid the Italian troops which had suffered a heavy defeat from British Commonwealth forces in Operation Compass. It was in Africa where Rommel achieved his greatest fame as a commander."
Attitude.
"Rommel was well known not only by the German people but also by his enemies. Stories of his chivalry and tactical ability earned him the respect of many opponents, including Claude Auchinleck, Winston Churchill, George S. Patton, Hugh Dowding, and Bernard Montgomery (who named a dog after him). Rommel was also respectful of his enemies. Hitler considered Rommel among his favorite generals."
"The ""Afrika Korps"" was never accused of any war crimes, and Rommel himself referred to the fighting in North Africa as ""Krieg ohne Hass"" — war without hate. Numerous examples exist of this such as his refusal to carry out an order from Hitler to execute Jewish prisoners. During Rommel's time in France, Hitler ordered him to deport the Jews in France; Rommel did not. Several times he wrote letters protesting the treatment of the Jews. When British Major Geoffrey Keyes was killed during a failed commando raid to kill or capture Rommel behind German lines, Rommel ordered him buried with full military honours. Also, during the construction of the Atlantic Wall, Rommel directed that French workers were not to be used as slaves but were to be paid for their labour."
Death.
"Rommel was not one of the group who planned the attempt on Hitler's life. Actually, he was not in favour of assassinating Hitler. Rommel believed an assassination attempt could spark civil war in Germany and Austria, and Hitler would have become a martyr for a lasting cause. Instead, Rommel insisted that Hitler be arrested and brought to trial for his crimes. Later, though, Rommel made up his mind to support the plot."
"After the failed bomb attack of 20 July 1944, many conspirators were arrested. Rommel was perturbed at this development. It did not take long for his involvement to come to light."
"Under Gestapo torture, one of that group revealed the names of several higher army officers who were consulted beforehand. Rommel was one of those."
"Even more damningly, Carl Goerdeler, the main civilian leader of the Resistance, wrote on several letters and other documents that Rommel was a potential supporter and an acceptable military leader to be placed in a position of responsibility should their coup succeed. Nazi party officials in France reported that Rommel extensively and scornfully criticised Nazi incompetence and crimes. That sealed his fate."
"The release of the movie """" (1951) helped his reputation as one of the most widely known and well-regarded leaders in the German Army. In the movie Patton (1970) Rommel was mentioned by General Patton in North Africa was fighting against the Nazis during the North African Campaign from 1940 to 1943 ."
Fermentation
Fermentation is when a cell uses sugar for energy without using oxygen at the same time.
"'Fermentation' also describes growing microorganisms on a growth medium. This is done to get a chemical product. French microbiologist Louis Pasteur studied fermentation and its microbial causes. The science of fermentation is known as ""zymology""."
"Yeast is an organism that ferments. When yeast ferments sugar, the yeast uses sugar and produces alcohol. The process uses the coenzyme NAD: In metabolism, NAD helps redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another. Fermentation is a less efficient form of respiration than oxidative respiration (respiration using oxygen)."
The ethyl alcohol produced by yeast is used to make beverages or biofuel. Yeast can be also used to grow bakery products like bread and cakes faster. In some cases yeast might be used to speed up the process of creation of wine.
"Other cells make vinegar or lactic acid when they ferment sugar. In a different way, the fermentation process can continue and turn the alcohol into vinegar i.e. acetic acid."
Types of fermentation.
"When yeast ferments, it breaks down the glucose (C6H12O6) into ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and carbon dioxide (CO2)."
Flower
A flower is the reproductive part of flowering plants. Flowers are also called the bloom or blossom of a plant. Flowers have petals. Inside the part of the flower that has petals are the parts which produce pollen and seeds.
"In all plants, a flower is usually its most colourful part. We say the plant 'flowers', 'is flowering' or 'is in flower' when this colourful part begins to grow bigger and open out. There are many different kinds of flowers in different areas in the world. Even in the coldest places, for example the Arctic, flowers can grow during a few months."
"Flowers may grow separately on the plant, or they may grow together in an inflorescence."
Structure of flowers.
"To investigate the structure of a flower, it must be dissected, and its structure summarised by a floral diagram or a floral formula. Then its family can be identified with the aid of a flora, which is a book designed to help you identify plants."
Four basic parts.
"Flowers have four basic parts, from the outside in they are:"
"Although this arrangement is typical, plant species show a wide variation in floral structure. The modifications produced in the evolution of flowering plants are used by botanists to find relationships among plant species."
"Flowers are an important evolutionary advance made by flowering plants. Some flowers are dependent upon the wind to move pollen between flowers of the same species. Their pollen grains are light-weight. Many others rely on insects or birds to move pollen. Their pollen grains are heavier. The role of flowers is to produce seeds. These are inside what botanists call the fruit. Fruits and seeds are a means of dispersal. Plants do not move, but wind, animals and birds spread the plants across the landscape."
Deaths.
"Most people who contract COVID-19 recover. For those who do not, the time between the start of symptoms and death usually ranges from6 to 41 days, but most of the time about 14 days. This data are recorded by the WHO."
Duration.
"On 11 March 2020, the WHO said that the pandemic could be controlled."
Symptoms.
"According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, COVID-19 makes people feel sick in different ways, but it usually affects the lungs. People usually cough and have difficulty breathing. They often also have a fever, chills, headache, pain in their muscles, or trouble tasting or smelling things, which can often be confused with the flu virus."
"According to an April 2020 study by the American Gastroenterological Association, COVID-19 can make sick people vomit or have diarrhea, but this is rare. They said about 7.7% of COVID-19 patients vomited, about 7.8% had diarrhea and about 3.6% had pain in their stomachs."
Name.
"In February 2020, the WHO announced a name for the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2: COVID-19. It replaced the name ""2019-nCoV."" ""Covi"" is for ""coronavirus,"" ""D"" for ""disease,"" and ""19"" for the year 2019 – the year it was first detected. They said they did not want the name to have any person, place, or animal in it because people might blame the disease on that place, person, or animal. For example, it did not use the word ""Wuhan."" They also wanted the name to be easy to say out loud."
Mortality rate of COVID-19.
"According to an article in Market Watch dated on February 27, 2020, the overall case mortality rate in China was 2.3%. However, these results might be severely different between different age groups and between men and women. People over the age of 70 experienced a rate of mortality 4-5 times that of the average. Men were more likely to die than women (2.8% versus 1.7% for women) possibly due to lifestyle, such as it being more possible in men to drink and smoke, making the risk of having a respiratory illness more possible, and thus more vulnerable. These numbers were the conclusion of a study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention using 72,314 COVID-19 cases in mainland China as of Feb. 11. At that point this was the largest sample of cases for such a study."
"On March 5, 2020, the WHO released the case fatality rate."
Race and racism.
"COVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for white Americans and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, ""The New York Times"" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This was not only in large cities but also in rural areas. This was not only for old people but for people in all age groups. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely as whites to become sick."
"Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public directly and to ride on public transport rather than take their own cars to work. This makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem."
"In June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) told the public that people using the United States' government's Medicare health program had different results depending on race. Four times as many black Medicare patients went to hospitals for COVID-19 than white Medicare patients. There were twice as many hospitalized Hispanic patients than white patients. There were three hospitalized Asian patients for every two hospitalized white patients. The head of CMS, Seema Verma, said this was mostly because of socioeconomic status."
"In the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangladesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons."
Indigenous peoples.
"Native Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived several weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands."
"Scientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best plan was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane."
"The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own."
George Floyd protests.
"In May 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were weeks of protests all over the world against police brutality and racism. Experts said they were worried protesters and police could spread SARS-CoV-2 to each other. Other experts said some of the reasons that the protests were so big was because non-white people were being killed by COVID-19 more than white people were, because poor leadership in the COVID-19 crisis reminded them of poor leadership about racism, and because the lockdowns shut down workplaces and other things. This meant people had more time to protest."
African Americans.
"African Americans are more likely to catch the virus compared to their white counterparts in the United States, and are also more likely to die from it. 50,000 African Americans died of COVID-19 in 2020. African Americans are the least likely to get vaccinated against the disease."
Romani people.
Romani people (Gypsies) in Europe were hard-hit by COVID-19.
Hispanics.
Latinos have been at a higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID-19 in the United States.
Conspiracy theories.
"In early 2020, some people began to think that the SARS-CoV-2 may have been made on purpose in a laboratory and either released by accident or on purpose like a weapon. Some Iranians thought the Americans might have made it. Chinese state media said COVID-19 came from the United States to China and not the other way around. Some Americans thought the Chinese might have made it. Some Britons thought it might have been created by accident by 5G cell phone networks."
"On March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in ""Nature Medicine"" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, it became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning that other scientists were reading and using it."
"That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%. Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round. Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%. In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%."
"Governor of Georgia, 1971–1975."
"Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he said that ""the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice"". ""Time"" ran a story on the progressive ""New South"" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover. The cover of the magazine had Carter."
"Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor. Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office. Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate."
"Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run. He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it. The plan was not popular in the state legislature. But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed. He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22."
"In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together. He said, ""I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate"". In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence."
"In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs. In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia. Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazu Médici. Many said he was acting like President Kennedy."
"The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor. He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting. While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster. He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference. Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it. Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, ""I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now""."
Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia. He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts. He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.
"In an unpopular move, Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River. He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region. The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country."
"Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits. Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances. He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick. He supported Senator Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, to not support George Wallace."
"In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue."
1976 presidential campaign.
Democratic primary.
"On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C. He talked about inequality, optimism, and change."
"When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians. However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points. Carter wrote ""Why Not the Best?"" in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public."
"Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian. He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race. Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote. He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention. He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick."
"During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, ""I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods"". Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation. However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race. His comments were unpopular with many Americans."
"Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing, creating a federal agency for consumer protection, creating a separate department for education, signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons, lowering money given to the military, increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class, supporting the Social Security Act, and having a budget that would give money to government resources."
1976 general election.
Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election. The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.
"Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of ""Playboy"" for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: ""I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times"". He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word ""fuck"". This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives."
"Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976. Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240. Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27."
"Presidency, 1977–81."
"Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977."
Domestic policies.
Energy crisis.
"On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war. He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House. He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House. On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy. During the signing event, Carter said the current ""crisis of energy shortages"" made him create the Department of Energy. Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas. A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill. He said that ""the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office"" was the energy crisis."
"On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful."
"In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill."
"On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it. On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is. At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan. On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a """" among the American people. Many did not like Carter's speech. People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis. Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government."
EPA Love Canal Superfund.
"The Preamble to the United States Constitution is a brief introduction to the Constitution's purposes and guiding principles. It provides the Founding Fathers' intentions for creating the Constitution and what they hoped the Constitution would achieve. It was added to the Constitution as an afterthought and was not discussed on the floor of the Constitutional Convention nor was it voted on. Gouverneur Morris, one of the writers of the Constitution, wrote and added it at the last moment. The Preamble itself did not have any legal meaning. The Supreme Court upheld this view in ""Jacobson v. Massachusetts"" (1905)."
We the People.
"""We the People"" means all of the citizens of the United States."
"The first few words of the Preamble ""We the People of the United States"" were very different than any treaty or law the United States had ever written before. For example, the United States' first constitution, the Articles of Confederation, describes itself as ""Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States,"" and then gives a list of all thirteen states. The treaties the United States had signed were the same. They were agreements between states, not people."
"At the time, Gouverneur Morris chose to write ""We the People"" instead of saying ""We the United States of..."" and then listing all thirteen states. First of all, Article Seven of the Constitution said that only nine states had to approve the Constitution for it to take effect. At the time, nobody knew which states would ratify the Constitution and which would not. Because of this, the Preamble could not list all thirteen states as if they had all already agreed. Also, if other states joined the United States later, it would be impossible to add their names to the list. For these reasons, the Preamble had to start with ""We the People."""
"The words ""We the People"" turned into a strong statement that this new government was made by the people of the United States, to benefit the people of the United States. When Virginia's delegates were debating the Constitution, Governor Edmund Randolph pointed out: ""The government is for the people; and the [problem] was, that the people had no [power] in the government before."" If the people are going to have to follow the government, he said, should not the people be the ones to create that government?"
In Order to form a more perfect Union.
"""In order to form a more perfect union"" is a concept most likely based on ""Commentaries on the Laws of England"" by Sir William Blackstone. It was widely read at the time and many of the framers were students of his work. Blackstone stated the constitution of England was perfect, but steadily improving. The phrase ""a more perfect union"" simply meant a better one than any before the Constitution."
"Before the government based on the Constitution, the United States was based on the Articles of Confederation. However, had very little power as a federal government. They did not give the United States government enough power for the country to work and grow. Every state was for itself, instead of working cooperatively. Sometimes they acted like thirteen separate countries that would only come together if another country attacked them."
Establish Justice.
"""Establish justice"" meant to establish the rule of law. It meant that everyone was equal before the law with no distinction between the status or wealth of a person. With their new government, the Founding Fathers wanted to establish (create) justice and fairness. When the British Empire governed the American colonies, the colonists did not think the government was fair. For example, Parliament would decide that the colonists had to pay taxes on items like stamps and things that were made in other countries. The colonists did not have any say in this."
"Even after the United States became independent, many of the Founding Fathers thought that the states had too much power under the Articles of Confederation. They thought the states had taken away people's rights."
"For example, during the Shays' Rebellion in Springfield, Massachusetts, the state of Massachusetts:"
Insure domestic Tranquility.
Shays' Rebellion was still fresh in the minds of the framers. It cause many to fear the spirit of the American Revolutionary War might be getting out of hand. There was a need to keep peace in the new country
"Just five years after the Articles of Confederation were ratified in 1781, many Americans were unhappy with the Articles. Many of the Founding Fathers thought that the Articles had made the United States government too weak. Shays' Rebellion made it very clear that the national government under the Articles of Confederation was not strong enough. Daniel Shays, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War, led the rebel farmers trying to overthrow the Massachusetts government. The farmers had formed an entire army, which neither the state or federal governments had enough soldiers or money to fight. In desperation Massachusetts offered to pay for a private army to fight the rebellion. Finally, in 1787, that private army defeated the rebels.pp. 84–86"
"John Jay, one of the Founding Fathers, said that after the United States government could not pay for soldiers to defend against any armed rebellion: ""the inefficiency of the Federal government [became] more and more [obvious]."" Another Founding Father, Henry Knox, said that Shays' Rebellion convinced many people that the United States needed a stronger federal government.p. 127 The Rebellion made it clear that the states were not protected, and if they were attacked, they would be on their own."
Provide for the common defense.
"""Provide for the common defense"" meant the framers were well aware that independence from Great Britain did not mean they were secure. British Canada to the north was still full of angry loyalists. To the west were unknown numbers of hostile Native American tribes. Farther west was the vast Louisiana territory held by France. To the south the Spanish held Florida. Worse, these powers were fighting a series of wars in Europe that affected much of North America. The framers knew America needed to protect itself. Providing for the common defence meant the new government would make sure all of the states were protected and defended if attacked."
Promote the general Welfare.
"""Promote the general welfare"" is the basic goal of all governments. It was the main reason for having a constitution."
"In general, this part of the Preamble means that one of the new government's jobs would be to make things better for the whole country. Specifically, this part of the Preamble has to do with the government's powers to tax people and spend money. It means that the new government will only have the power to tax and spend on things that are good for the entire country. The government will not be allowed to spend money on things that will be good for only a part of the country, or only some people in the country."
"For example, of the Constitution gives Congress the power to tax people and spend money on creating Post Offices and building roads for mail carriers to use. Congress can do this because Post Offices will ""promote the general Welfare""—everybody in the country will benefit from being able to send and get mail."
Secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.
"""Secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity"" was important since many had come to America from places with little political or religious freedom. This phrase demonstrates the intent of the new government to protect the newly-won freedoms and protect against a tyrannical government."
"However, the Articles of Confederation were all about the states' rights. At that time, many people were afraid of having a federal government that was too strong. These people were called anti-federalists. They included some of the Founding Fathers, like Patrick Henry and James Monroe. The anti-federalists worried that a strong federal government could become tyrannical and take away the rights of individual states, like they thought the British colonial government had done. They also worried that a government ruled by a President might turn into a monarchy, where the President would become a King and have total power. Because of these worries, the Articles of Confederation talked all about states' rights, and not about individual people's rights. The framers wanted to establish these rights for the people of the United States and their ""posterity"" meaning all the generations of Americans who would follow."
Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
"""Do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America"" is perhaps the strongest statement in the Preamble. It says in effect that the people made the Constitution and it is the people who give it power."
"The Preamble to the United States Constitution, is the beginning of the Constitution. It is not a law. Instead, it talks about the Founding Fathers' reasons for writing the Constitution, and what they hope the Constitution will do."
Thelma Aldana
"Thelma Aldana or Thelma Esperanza Aldana Hernández de López (born September 27, 1955), is a Guatemalan lawyer. She became a judge in the Supreme Court in 2009. She was elected president of the Supreme Court from 2011 to 2011. In 2013 she replaced Claudia Paz y Paz as Guatemala’s attorney general."
The General Theory of Relativity.
"The General Theory of Relativity was published in 1915, ten years after the special theory of relativity was created. Einstein's general theory of relativity uses the idea of spacetime. Spacetime is the fact that we have a four-dimensional universe, having three spatial (space) dimensions and one temporal (time) dimension. Any physical event happens at some place inside these three space dimensions, and at some moment in time. According to the general theory of relativity, any mass causes spacetime to curve, and any other mass follows these curves. Bigger mass causes more curving. This was a new way to explain gravitation (gravity)."
"General relativity explains gravitational lensing, which is light bending when it comes near a massive object. This explanation was proven correct during a solar eclipse, when the sun's bending of starlight from distant stars could be measured because of the darkness of the eclipse."
"General relativity also set the stage for cosmology (theories of the structure of our universe at large distances and over long times). Einstein thought that the universe may curve a little bit in both space and time, so that the universe always had existed and always will exist, and so that if an object moved through the universe without bumping into anything, it would return to its starting place, from the other direction, after a very long time. He even changed his equations to include a ""cosmological constant,"" in order to allow a mathematical model of an unchanging universe. The general theory of relativity also allows the universe to spread out (grow larger and less dense) forever, and most scientists think that astronomy has proved that this is what happens. When Einstein realized that good models of the universe were possible even without the cosmological constant, he called his use of the cosmological constant his ""biggest blunder,"" and that constant is often left out of the theory. However, many scientists now believe that the cosmological constant is needed to fit in all that we now know about the universe."
"A popular theory of cosmology is called the Big Bang. According to the Big Bang theory, the universe was formed 15 billion years ago, in what is called a ""gravitational singularity"". This singularity was small, dense, and very hot. According to this theory, all of the matter that we know today came out of this point."
"Einstein himself did not have the idea of a ""black hole"", but later scientists used this name for an object in the universe that bends spacetime so much that not even light can escape it. They think that these ultra-dense objects are formed when giant stars, at least three times the size of our sun, die. This event can follow what is called a supernova. The formation of black holes may be a major source of gravitational waves, so the search for proof of gravitational waves has become an important scientific pursuit."
Beliefs.
"Many scientists only care about their work, but Einstein also spoke and wrote often about politics and world peace. He liked the ideas of socialism and of having only one government for the whole world. He also worked for Zionism, the effort to try to create the new country of Israel."
"Prompted by his colleague L. E. J. Brouwer, Einstein read the philosopher Eric Gutkind's book ""Choose Life"", a discussion of the relationship between Jewish revelation and the modern world. On January 3, 1954, Einstein sent the following reply to Gutkind: ""The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. ... For me the Jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstitions."" In 2018 his letter to Gutkind was sold for $2.9 million."
"Even though Einstein thought of many ideas that helped scientists understand the world much better, he disagreed with some scientific theories that other scientists liked. The theory of quantum mechanics discusses things that can happen only with certain probabilities, which cannot be predicted with more precision no matter how much information we might have. This theoretical pursuit is different from statistical mechanics, in which Einstein did important work. Einstein did not like the part of quantum theory that denied anything more than the probability that something would be found to be true of something when it was actually measured; he thought that it should be possible to predict anything, if we had the correct theory and enough information. He once said, ""I do not believe that God plays dice with the Universe."""
"Because Einstein helped science so much, his name is now used for several different things. A unit used in photochemistry was named for him. It is equal to Avogadro's number multiplied by the energy of one photon of light. The chemical element Einsteinium is named after the scientist as well. In slang, we sometimes call a very smart person an ""Einstein."""
Criticism.
"Most scientists think that Einstein's theories of special and general relativity work very well, and they use those ideas and formulas in their own work. Einstein disagreed that phenomena in quantum mechanics can happen out of pure chance. He believed that all natural phenomena have explanations that do not include pure chance. He spent much of his later life trying to find a ""unified field theory"" that would include his general relativity theory, Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism, and perhaps a better quantum theory. Most scientists do not think that he succeeded in that attempt."
Euro
"Euro is the currency of the countries in the eurozone. One euro is divided into 100 ""cent"" (officially) (singular) or ""cents"" (unofficially)."
"Because of the number of different languages in the European Union, there are different, unofficial, names for this unit (the French call them ""centimes"" and the Spanish ""céntimos"", for example)."
"It was created in 1999, but until 1 January 2002 it was used only for electronic payments. In 2002, 12 countries of the European Union (EU) took their state currencies out of circulation and adopted euro notes and coins as their only money. There was a change-over period, called the ""transition period"", when both the old national money and the euro were accepted, but by 28 February 2002, all 12 countries were using just euros."
"In 2006, Slovenia became the 13th country to use the euro. In 2008 Cyprus and Malta became the 14th and 15th countries to use the euro. In 2009, Slovakia became the 16th country to use the euro. In 2011, Estonia became the 17th country to use the euro. In 2014, Latvia became the 18th country and in 2015, Lithuania became the 19th country to use the euro."
"There are seven different banknotes, each one with a different colour, size and face value: €5 (grey), €10 (red), €20 (blue), €50 (orange), €100 (green), €200 (yellow), €500 (purple)."
"Coins are of eight different amounts: €0.01, €0.02, €0.05, €0.10, €0.20, €0.50, €1 and €2."
"On every banknote, there is a picture of a different European building style. All banknotes are the same throughout the entire eurozone; there are no different designs for different countries, unlike the euro coins. One side of each coin is the same in all euro countries. The other side is different since each country who mints the coins inserts a symbol relating to that country. Today there are many different sets of coins. Any of the coins can be used everywhere throughout the eurozone despite the country-specific symbol on the back."
The ten new European countries that entered the European Union in May 2004 are planning to adopt the Euro also. First they must meet some conditions to show that they have stable economies.
Symbol.
The symbol for the euro is the Greek letter epsilon (E) with two horizontal lines: €.
Some people see it as the Latin capital letter C with an equal sign (=).
"It is also legal to simply write ""euro"". This is especially useful when the symbol cannot be produced, or the result is not satisfactory."
Members of the eurozone are:
These countries form the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
"Even though they are not part of the EU, the euro is also the currency used in:"
"Many other countries' currencies are ""pegged"" (tied) to, although not exactly equal to, the euro:"
A urinary tract infection is said to be complicated if:
"Otherwise if a women is a healthy and before menopause, the infection is said to be uncomplicated. When children also have a fever, the urinary tract infection is considered to be an upper urinary tract infection."
In children.
"To diagnose a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required. Contamination poses a frequent challenge so a cutoff of 105 CFU/mL is used for a ""clean-catch"" mid-stream sample, 104 CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 102 CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder through the stomach wall with a needle). The World Health Organization does not like the use of “urine bags” to collect samples because there is a high rate of contamination when that urine is cultured. Catheterization is preferred if an individual is unable to use a toilet. Some medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time X-rays while they urinate) in all children who are younger than 2 years old and have had a urinary tract infection.Other medical groups such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend routine imaging only in babies younger than 6 months old or who have unusual findings."
Differential diagnosis.
"In women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a ""Chlamydia trachomatis"" or ""Neisseria gonorrheae"" infection may be the cause. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) can be the cause for people who have UTI symptoms many times, but whose urine cultures remain negative and do not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis."
Treatment.
"Phenazopyridine can be used in addition to antibiotics to help ease the burning pain of a bladder infection. However, phenazopyridine is no longer commonly recommended due to safety concerns. It can cause methemoglobinemia, which means there is higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood. Acetaminophen can be used for fevers."
Women who keep getting simple UTIs can benefit from self-treatment; these women should get medical treatment medical only if the initial treatment fails. Health care providers may also prescribe the antibiotics by phone.
Uncomplicated.
"Simple infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone. Oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, or a fluoroquinolone will shorten the time to recovery. All these drugs are equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually enough. Nitrofurantoin needs 5–7 days. With treatment, symptoms should improve within 36 hours. About 50% of people will get better without treatment within a few days or weeks. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend fluoroquinolones as first treatment because of concerns that overuse will lead to resistance to this class of drugs, making these drugs less effective for more serious infections. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these drugs because to their widespread use. In some countries, trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX. Children with simple UTIs are often helped by a three-day course of antibiotics."
Pyelonephritis.
"Pyelonephritis (kidney infection) is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in geographic areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone often is prescribed. People with more severe symptoms are sometimes admitted a hospital for ongoing antibiotics. If symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment, it can mean that the urinary tract is blocked by a kidney stone."
Likelihood.
"Urinary tract infections are the most frequent bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35 years. Ten percent of women get an infection yearly; 60% have an infection at some point in their lives. Nearly half of people get a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) occurs between 20–30 times less frequently than bladder infections. Pyelonephritis is the most common cause of hospital acquired infections, accounting for approximately 40% of hospital-acquired infections. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from 2% to 7% in women of childbearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of aysmtomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are 7-10%."
"Urinary tract infections can affect 10% of people during childhood. Urinary tract infections in children are the most common in uncircumcised males younger than 3 months of age, followed by females younger than one year. Estimates of frequency among children, however, vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and 2 years, 2- 20% were diagnosed with a UTI."
Society and culture.
"In the United States, urinary tract infections lead to nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and 100,000 hospitalizations every year. The cost of these infections is high due to both lost time at work and costs of medical care. The direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6 billion USD yearly in the United States."
History.
"Urinary tract infections have been described since ancient times. The first written description, found in the Ebers Papyrus, dates to around 1550 BC. The Egyptians described a urinary tract infection as ""sending forth heat from the bladder."" Herbs, bloodletting, and rest were the common treatments until the 1930s, when antibiotics became available. Sulphonamides became available around 1935."
In pregnancy.
"Pregnant women with UTIs have a higher risk of kidney infections.During pregnancy, high progesterone (a hormone) levels decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder. Decreased muscle tone leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and toward the kidneys. If bacteria are present, pregnant women have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus treatment is recommended if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because those medications are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, or seizures)."
Thumbelina
"""Thumbelina"" () is a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen."
"The tale was first printed by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen, Denmark. ""Thumbelina"" is about a tiny girl. She has several adventures with a toad, a mole, a field mouse, and other creatures of field and forest. At the end, she meets and falls in love with a flower-fairy prince just her size."
"""Thumbelina"" was one of nine fairy tales Andersen printed between 1835 and 1837 in a series of three booklets. These booklets were called ""Fairy Tales Told for Children"". ""Thumbelina"" appeared in the second booklet with ""The Naughty Boy"" and ""The Traveling Companion"". The first booklet included ""The Tinderbox"", ""Great Claus and Little Claus"", ""The Princess and the Pea"", and ""Little Ida's Flowers"". The third booklet was printed in 1837. Only two tales, ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", appeared in the third and final booklet."
"""Thumbelina"" is completely Andersen's invention. He did however know tales about tiny people such as ""Tom Thumb"" and the six-inch tall Lilliputians in ""Gulliver's Travels"". He may have taken some inspiration from these tales. Andersen's tales were not liked by the Danish critics. They did not like their casual style and their lack of morals. One critic liked ""Thumbelina"". He called it ""delightful"". The tale has been adapted to an animated movie and a live-action television programme."
Plot.
"A woman wants a baby. She asks a witch to help her. The witch gives the woman a barleycorn. She tells the woman to plant it, and wait for what will happen. The barleycorn is planted, and a flower grows. When the woman kisses the flower, it pops open to reveal tiny Thumbelina."
"One night, Thumbelina is asleep in her walnut-shell cradle. She is carried off by a toad who hops through an open window. The toad wants the tiny girl as a bride for her son. She puts Thumbelina on a lily pad for safekeeping. Thumbelina escapes the toad with the help of friendly fish and a white butterfly. She floats away on the lily pad."
"She is suddenly snatched and carried away by a cockchafer (beetle). The beetle's friends are proud and arrogant. Thumbelina is not of their social class. They take a dislike to her at once. The beetle drops her without a second thought, and flies away."
Lamarck.
"Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744–1829), a French biologist, claimed that animals changed according to natural laws. He said that animals could pass on traits they had acquired during their lifetime to their offspring, using inheritance. Today, his theory is known as Lamarckism. Its main purpose is to explain adaptations by natural means. He proposed a tendency for organisms to become more complex, moving up a ladder of progress, plus ""use and disuse""."
Lamarck's idea was that a giraffe's neck grew longer because it tried to reach higher up. This idea failed because it conflicts with heredity (Mendel's work). Mendel made his discoveries about half a century after Lamarck's work.
Darwin.
"Charles Darwin (1809–1882) wrote his ""On the Origin of Species"" in 1859. In this book, he put forward much evidence that evolution had occurred. He also proposed natural selection as the way evolution had taken place. But Darwin did not understand about genetics and how traits were actually passed on. He could not accurately explain what made children look like their parents."
"Nevertheless, Darwin's explanation of evolution was fundamentally correct. In contrast to Lamarck, Darwin's idea was that the giraffe's neck became longer because ""those with longer necks survived better"".p177/9 These survivors passed their genes on, and in time the whole species got longer necks."
Wallace.
"Alfred Russel Wallace OM FRS (1823–1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, biologist and social activist. He proposed a theory of natural selection at about the same time as Darwin. His idea was published in 1858 together with Charles Darwin's idea."
Mendel.
"An Austrian monk called Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) bred plants. In the mid-19th century, he discovered how traits were passed on from one generation to the next."
"He used peas for his experiments: some peas have white flowers and others have red ones. Some peas have green seeds and others have yellow seeds. Mendel used artificial pollination to breed the peas. His results are discussed further in Mendelian inheritance. Darwin thought that the inheritance from both parents blended together. Mendel proved that the genes from the two parents stay separate, and may be passed on unchanged to later generations."
"Mendel published his results in a journal that was not well-known, and his discoveries were overlooked. Around 1900, his work was rediscovered. Genes are bits of information made of DNA which work like a set of instructions. A set of genes are in every living cell. Together, genes organise the way an egg develops into an adult. With mammals, and many other living things, a copy of each gene comes from the father and another copy from the mother. Some living organisms, including some plants, only have one parent, so get all their genes from them. These genes produce the genetic differences which evolution acts on."
Darwin's theory.
"Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" has two themes: the evidence for evolution, and his ideas on how evolution took place. This section deals with the second issue."
Variation.
"The first two chapters of the ""Origin"" deal with variation in domesticated plants and animals, and variation in nature."
"All living things show variation. Every population which has been studied shows that animal and plants vary as much as humans do.p90 This is a great fact of nature, and without it evolution would not occur. Darwin said that, just as man selects what he wants in his farm animals, so in nature the variations allow natural selection to work."
"The features of an individual are influenced by two things, heredity and environment. First, development is controlled by genes inherited from the parents. Second, living brings its own influences. Some things are entirely inherited, others partly, and some not inherited at all."
"The colour of eyes is entirely inherited; they are a genetic trait. Height or weight is only partly inherited, and the language is not at all inherited. Just to be clear: the fact that humans can speak is inherited, but what language is spoken depends on where a person lives and what they are taught. Another example: a person inherits a brain of somewhat variable capacity. What happens after birth depends on many things such as home environment, education and other experiences. When a person is adult, their brain is what their inheritance and life experience have made it."
"""Evolution only concerns the traits which can be inherited"", wholly or partly. The hereditary traits are passed on from one generation to the next through the genes. A person's genes contain all the traits which they inherit from their parents. The accidents of life are not passed on. Also, of course, each person lives a somewhat different life: that increases the differences."
"Organisms in any population vary in reproductive success.p81 From the point of view of evolution, 'reproductive success' means the total number of offspring which live to breed and leave offspring themselves."
Inherited variation.
"Variation can only affect future generations if it is inherited. Because of the work of Gregor Mendel, we know that much variation is inherited. Mendel's 'factors' are now called genes. Research has shown that ""almost every individual in a sexually reproducing species is genetically unique"".p204"
"Genetic variation is increased by gene mutations. DNA does not always reproduce exactly. Rare changes occur, and these changes can be inherited. Many changes in DNA cause faults; some are neutral or even advantageous. This gives rise to genetic variation, which is the seed-corn of evolution. Sexual reproduction, by the crossing over of chromosomes during meiosis, spreads variation through the population. Other events, like natural selection and drift, reduce variation. So a population in the wild always has variation, but the details are always changing.p90"
Natural selection.
"Evolution mainly works by natural selection. What does this mean? Animals and plants which are best suited to their environment will, on average, survive better. There is a struggle for existence. Those who survive will produce the next generation. Their genes will be passed on, and the genes of those who did not reproduce will not. This is the basic mechanism which changes a population and causes evolution."
"Natural selection explains why living organisms change over time to have the anatomy, the functions and behaviour that they have. It works like this:"
Selection in natural populations.
"There are now many cases where natural selection has been proved to occur in wild populations. Almost every case investigated of camouflage, mimicry and polymorphism has shown strong effects of selection."
"The force of selection can be much stronger than was thought by the early population geneticists. The resistance to pesticides has grown quickly. Resistance to ""warfarin"" in Norway rats (""Rattus norvegicus"") grew rapidly because those that survived made up more and more of the population. Research showed that, in the absence of ""warfarin"", the resistant homozygote was at a 54% disadvantage to the normal wild type homozygote.p182 This great disadvantage was quickly overcome by the selection for ""warfarin"" resistance."
"Mammals normally cannot drink milk as adults, but humans are an exception. Milk is digested by the enzyme lactase, which switches off as mammals stop taking milk from their mothers. The human ability to drink milk during adult life is supported by a lactase mutation which prevents this switch-off. Human populations have a high proportion of this mutation wherever milk is important in the diet. The spread of this 'milk tolerance' is promoted by natural selection, because it helps people survive where milk is available. Genetic studies suggest that the oldest mutations causing lactase persistence only reached high levels in human populations in the last ten thousand years. Therefore, lactase persistence is often cited as an example of recent human evolution. As lactase persistence is genetic, but animal husbandry a cultural trait, this is gene–culture coevolution."
Adaptation.
"In 1967, Hideto joined the manga and backbone trio (with Yukihiro Kimura And The Backbones) and began his professional career as a singer. Also, with Kimura's instruction to ""sing rock"", sing ""Long Tall Sally"" by The Beatles from June of that year and then sing ""Out of Time"" and ""Tell Me"" by The Rolling Stones. (The fact that the manager of Penguin-do recommended that the LP of the live version of the Stones had a great influence on Hideto Noguchi's theatrical performance later), and the name of Hideto Noguchi in Kansai was given to know gradually."
"The intense staging became popular and the mobilization power increased when the spine appeared. Toshio Fukui, the leader of the GS Ox band, who saw the performance of ""Tel Me"" at the Jazz Cafe ""Number Ichiban"", said: ""Only our band and have the Binson resonance chamber in Japan! "" Noguchi joined the band in December 1967, but at the time he didn't know what Binson was. He made his debut as the vocalist of ""Ox"" in May 1968. His stage name is Hideto Noguchi, in honor of Meiji era bacteriologist Hideyo Noguchi. He made Top 10 and Top 20 hits like ""Girl Friend"", ""Dancing Seventeen"", ""Swan no Nami"" and ""I'm Burning"". The ""Girl Friend"", ""Swan no Nami"" and other two songs were composed by . At the beginning of her debut, Ai Akamatsu's popularity preceded him, but when he released his second single, ""Dancing Seventeen,"" it overwhelmingly separated him from the popularity poll, and the center of popularity shifted to Hideto Noguchi. In the mid to late GS boom, many dialogues between , and Hideto Noguchi were seen in magazines."
"Performances began at six venues across the country in September, causing a swoon on the stage at every venue, including the Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya Public Hall on the first day, which the media hyped them as ""bands passing out."" Ox was called the ""GS Gosanke"" along with and . On May 23, 1970, the Ox held the ""Subtitle"" Second Anniversary Concert and ""Blow Off Elvis Presley"". It was a concert that also served as a new song announcement for me, but Ox at the time was still quite popular along side with the Tigers. The group was disbanded on May 31, 1971. In that same year, Hideto made his first solo debut with ""Masked"". After that, he released singles such as ""What Else Is There"" and ""Yozora no Fuseki"", and released the album ""Hidetokara You ni"" which contains his own ""Clown Who Forgot To Laugh"" line."
Solo debut.
"In 1975, he prepared to leave from the ""All Japan Kayo Championship"" and won 10 awards every weeks. Renamed to ""Hideto Maki"" after his teacher , he made his debut as an enka singer again with ""Yumeyo Mouichido"". This debut song became the first big hit as a solo singer and it broke again to rank 9th on the Oricon national chart and won several excellent newcomer awards. Also, despite being released in September, it is in the Oricon Annual Best 100, and was selected as a candidate song for the nomination at the end of the year. Many of the fans were middle and high school students who couldn't see the GS era in real time, and Maki himself was concerned that it would end with a transitory boom."
"As an aside, the kanji for ""ki"" with Hideto Maki was separated by Hiroshi Itsuki from the same office at the request of Yoko Yamaguchi. As a younger brother from the same office, he also participates in Itsuki's fan club event, and photos from that time are posted on Hideto Maki's website. In 1976, he won the Tokyo Shimbun Best Hit Award for ""Drowning in Love."" In that same year, he won the popular award, silver award, and other awards at the Iizuka Music Festival for her third single ""Somewhere in Tokyo"". The guest at that time was veteran female actress singer Hibari Misora, and Hideto said that he became more and more of Hibari's fan when she said, ""I know you."" At the time, master jazz pianist Yuzuru Sera said, ""Hideto is more suited to jazz than enka. I will teach you how to become a jazz singer."" Every time he met him, Masato Fujita, a master enka composer, would tell him ""because one day, I'll write a music note with Hideto Maki."""
"Fujita's perception changed completely with the ""flow"" sung by Hideto on his special show when he was Ox, and even after his re-debut, the paternal replacement for . He also appeared on love shows. It is a pity that the dream with both teachers did not come true. In 1978, with George Yanagi and Rainy Wood, he released his seventh single ""Cammon"" beyond the limits of record companies. It is not an enka song, but a rock style song. At the time, the song was played with a playful feeling, but as she was about to transform into a rock singer, Maki's fierce opposition returned to the enka line."
"Appeared at the New Years Rock Festival (International Theater) (moderated by Haruo Chikada). The festival is produced by . The turn came between the Downtown Boogie Woogie Band and Rainy Wood, and Maki also sang the song). As an enka singer, only Maki appears at this rock festival, but Yuya Uchida spoke directly to Maki and took notice. ""Ame no Tokyo"" is karaoke and wired, and it won the best-selling award. After that, he released ""Happy Thin Woman"" and ""Hotarugawa"" and it became a huge hit. It seems that the number of adult fans has increased around here, and there are many male fans who like ""I am a happy slim woman""."
Popularity and participation.
"Also, Yuya asked him to appear in the ""Carnival of the West"" which was revived when the Nippon Theater was demolished, but Maki himself said it would be strange to appear again because Ox had refused to appear in the ""Carnival of the West"" in the past. . . It is said that he refused the offer. In 1988, Taro Morimoto asked him to join The Tigers Memorial Club Band, where he was able to balance solo and GS singers for eight years. (It is the largest GS unit released at the Osaka Castle Hall / Yokohama Arena concert)."
"Upon entering Heisei, the song ""Genki no Hoshi"", which begins with the lyrics of ""Ace No. 4 from childhood"", became a hit song since ""Ame no Tokyo"" and is still played in the second match. of the Yomiuri Giants army. Sing the original song ""Thank You For Love"" on the 2010 project work album ""Shido We ga Hibi"". It is also a charity song for the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. On March 28, 2012, Sony Music released 21 songs by Hideto Maki and G ☆ B ""Euphoric Flame Song"" to mark the 45th anniversary of the singer's debut, but they are still selling steadily. In 2015, he celebrated the 40th anniversary of the name change to Hideto Maki, and on May 24, a limited edition of 120 people, ""Don't Forget Your Original Intent, Yukihiro Kimura and Backbone Live"" was made for the first time. in about 50 years (Kimura). Returning Yukihiro Live). The Ox's (ongoing) reunion is ""impossible""."
"However, in reality, the members except Ai Akamatsu and Yusuke Taura (Yûsuke Natsu) have met sporadically on the old-fashioned tune show, sometimes singing Ox-era songs in solo live performances. It's been 50 years since he started as a professional singer in 2017. 2018 marked the 50th anniversary of the Ox first debut."
"On September 9, 2018, due to fan enthusiasm, Yukihiro Kimura and Backbone Live were held in Osaka Moerado for the first time in 3 years and were sold out."
"In 2019, he will appear on ""Eternal Showa Hit Kayo On Stage"" in May and July. At the May Concert, youth songs will be played, which is also their starting point, and at the July concert, GS-era songs will be played at downtown. On May 5, 2020, Sony Music released a 5-CD-BOX set of 111 songs, including a new song for the first time in approximately 30 years, as a tribute to Kouki. (The first CD reprint of Hideto Noguchi's song, including hit songs from the Ox era, hit songs after being renamed Hideto Maki, and even ""Genki no Hoshi"")."
"As of June 10, only Sony sound sources will be distributed for ""euphoria, intoxication, hiding and clause"". Serialized in Nihon Keizai Shimbun, interviews with four major newspapers, radio appearances and other activities with Reiwa's Hideto Maki began."
Ai Akamatsu
"Ai Akamatsu (赤松愛, ""Akamatsu"" ""Ai"", February 14, 1951; {age 69} - ) is a Japanese musician and keyboardist for the Japanese rock band group, the Ox until 1969. His real name is Yoshinobu Akamatsu (赤松義信, ""Akamatsu Yoshinobu"") and his nickname was Ai-chan (アイちゃん)."
Life and music career.
"Born in Ashiya City, Hyogo Prefecture in 1951, His father is the president of the company and is the youngest of three siblings. Akamatsu learned the to play a piano from an early age, and when he was in the second year of junior high school, he said, ""I want to play jazz,"" and his mother opposed ""that kind of music is bad."" However, in the end, he joined Hatari's and became a semi-professional at the dance hall ""Fuji"" in Osaka at that time. After that, he was invited to join Ox."
Life in the band.
"The looks of the red brown hair's bob head were lovely, and it became very popular as an idol. However, he disappeared on May 5, 1969 and leave the group. Yoko Ono and Toshimitsu Imai, an old painter, traveled to England on June 23 to ""become a disciple of John Lennon"" as guardian. While staying in London, he lived a life of hanging out at Apple's office, but during that time he returned to Japan temporarily and played the role of Aoyama with Shoji Ishibashi and others in the stage play """" sponsored by the new national drama from June 3 to 26, 1970. After that, Akamatsu retired from the entertainment world. His father returned to Japan on September 28, 1978 due to a sudden illness. Currently, he takes over the family business and runs an ironworks in Osaka."
Retirement.
"After retiring, Akamatsu injured his finger due to the circumstances at the time of withdrawal and an accident during press work in the family business (there was a story that he lost his finger, but as far as the video after that, his finger is normal). He will not appear at all on sporadic reunions on old-fashioned programs (Akamatsu's vocal song is Hideto Maki, organ is represented by an external support member) and GS events, but on May 4, 1989 In addition to interviewing his wife on Fuji TV's idol special feature on the day, he appeared on TBS's GS special feature on October 4, 2003, delighting fans with the same appearance as at that time."
Yûsuke Natsu
"Yûsuke Natsu (夏夕介, ""Natsu Yûsuke"", October 30, 1950; Arao, Kumamoto - January 27, 2010, Tokyo, Japan {age 59} - ), also known as Yuki Taura (田浦 幸, ""Taura Yuki"") (his former stage name), is a Japanese keyboardist and actor. His real name is Hisayuki Taura (田浦 久幸, ""Taura Hisayuki"") and his nickname was Yuki (ユキ)."
Music and acting careers.
"Natsu was in charge of the organ in the Osaka band ""Grump Leeds"". After graduating from high school in the spring of 1969, he moved to Tokyo after his professional debut with , who was a vocalist for Grumpleys. Yuki Taura was added to the popular group sounds band ""Ox"" at the time, taking over Ai Akamatsu, who left the group in May of the same year after being bought by HoriPro, the agency of Wada.” In 1970, he changed his stage name to ""Yusuke Natsu"" while enrolled in ""Ox"" and made his debut as a solo singer with ""Tears Burning"". At the same time, he entered the acting business and made his first movie debut with """". In 1971, the Ox was disbanded at the end of May. While appearing in the TV dramas like ""How About A Beautiful Woman?"", Natsu became a trainee of the theater company NLT."
Appearing on films and TV shows.
"In 1972, he was selected to play the leading role of Junichiro Iwaki in the unique stage show-style hero program called """" (produced by ), which was broadcast from October to December. In 1974, in ""Love Love Rivals"" (TBS series), while performing a comical performance, he turned aside and performed a comical performance, while in "" (Tokyo 12 channel-current TV), a drama adaptation of the popular comic based on . As the leading role of Makoto Taiga, he played the opposite role of , who made her first acting debut, and became a popular actress. In 1976, he starred in the movie ""Ai no Nagisa"" (directed by Junzen Nemoto, produced by ) for the first time. In the same year, he played the role of a protagonist again in """" as Joji Hayama / Skyzel, along side with Takeshi Sasaki (who previously portrayed Hayato Ichimonji in Kamen Rider (-TBS series)."
Latter career.
"Also read again and for the third time at least Miss Austen's very finely written novel of ""Pride and Prejudice"". That young lady had a talent for describing the and feelings and characters of ordinary life which is to me the most wonderful I ever met with. The Big Bow-wow strain I can do myself like any now going, but the exquisite touch which renders (makes) ordinary commonplace things and characters interesting from the truth of the description and the sentiment is denied to me. What a pity such a gifted creature died so early!"
"""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Persuasion"" were published together in December 1817. They were reviewed in the ""British Critic"" in March 1818 and in the ""Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany"" in May 1818. The reviewer for the ""British Critic"" felt that Austen's great use of realism was proof of a limited imagination. The reviewer for the ""Edinburgh Review"" thought differently. He praised Austen for her "" invention"". He was also pleased with Austen's stories because they mixed familiar scenes with surprising twists. Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her works. For example, they wrongly understood her use of irony. Reviewers thought ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" were stories of virtue overcoming vice."
"In the ""Quarterly Review"" in 1821 another review came out. Richard Whately was an English writer and theologican. He published the most serious early review of Austen's work. Whately compared Austen and great writers such as Homer and Shakespeare with favor. He praised the dramatic quality of her stories. He also said that the novel was a real, respectable genre of literature. He argued that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was very valuable. He even said they were more important than history or biography. When it was well done, as Austen's works were, Whately said that novels wrote about human experience that the reader could learn from. In other words, he believed that it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer. He wrote: ""we suspect one of Miss Austin's [""sic""] great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge (admit) it."" No better criticism of Austen was put in print until the late nineteenth century. Whately and Scott had begun the Victorian era's view of Austen."
1821–1870: Cultured few.
"Austen had a great number of readers who liked and respected her in the nineteenth century. According to critic Ian Watt, they liked her "" to ordinary (usual) social experience"". However, Austen's works were not exactly what her Romantic and Victorian British audience liked. They wished for ""powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and color in the writing"". Victorian critics and audiences liked the work of writers like Charles Dickens and George Eliot. Compared to them, Austen's works seemed narrow and quiet. Austen's works were put in print again beginning in late 1832 or early 1833. Richard Bentley printed them in the ""Standard Novels"" series, and remained in print for a long time after that. However, they were not bestsellers. Southam describes her ""reading public between 1821 and 1870"" as ""minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries""."
"The people who read Austen saw themselves as clever readers. They were the cultured few. This became a well-known theme of Austen criticism in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. George Henry Lewes was a philosopher and literary critic. He spoke about this theme in a series of articles in the 1840s and 1850s. ""The Novels of Jane Austen"" was put in print in ""Blackwood's Magazine"" in 1859. In there, Lewes praised Austen's books for ""the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid (help) from superfluous elements"". He also compared her to Shakespeare. He argued that Austen was not good at making up plots. However, he still enjoyed the dramatic quality of her works. He said: ""The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense (very strong); but his interest never wanes (stops) for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators (viewers) of the little drama."""
"Writer Charlotte Brontë liked Austen's writing because they were truthful about everyday life. However, Brontë called her ""only shrewd (clever) and observant"". She said there was not enough passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work seemed formal and narrow. In a letter written to G.H. Lewes in 1848, Brontë said that she did not like ""Pride and Prejudice"". She said:"
Nineteenth-century European translations.
"Soon after Austen's works were printed in Britain, they appeared in some European countries. They began appearing in 1813 with a French translation of ""Pride and Prejudice"". It was quickly followed by German, Dutch, and Swedish editions. They were not always easy to get in Europe. Austen was not well known in Russia. The first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Austen’s works were translated into various European languages. However, Europeans did not see her works as part of the English novel tradition. This was partly because of the changes made by translators. They put in sentimentalism into Austen's works. They also failed to put in her humor and irony. Therefore, European readers more often thought of Walter Scott's style as the English novel."
"The great changes made by her translators made the Continent receive Austen differently than in Britain. For example, the French writer Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's ""Pride and Prejudice"", lively conversations (talks) between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by calm, proper ones. In Jane Austen's work, Elizabeth said that she has ""always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds"" (her and Darcy's). She says this is because they are ""unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze (surprise) the whole room"". However, this becomes ""Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet."" (""Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking."") Cossy and Saglia explained, ""the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied (not given) and gender distinction introduced"". Austen’s works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition. Because of this, people were more interested in the works of French realists like Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. Austen was also treated as a romantic writer in Germany."
1870–1930: Explosion in popularity.
Family biographies.
"For years, people thought the same of Austen as Scott and Whately. Only a few people actually read her novels. In 1870 the first important Austen biography, ""A Memoir of Jane Austen"", was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh and printed. This changed the way people thought of Austen. When it came out in print, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased greatly. The ""Memoir"" made people think of an untrained writer who wrote masterpieces. People thought Austen was a quiet, middle-aged unmarried aunt. This made them feel that her works were safe for respectable Victorian families to read. The ""Memoir"" made Austen's books be printed again in great numbers. The first popular editions came out in 1883. They were a cheap series printed by Routledge. This was followed by editions with pictures, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, critics still said that only people who could really understand the deep meaning of Austen's books should read them. However, after the ""Memoir"" was printed, much more criticism about Austen was printed. More came out in two years than had come out in the last 50 years."
"In 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh printed a family biography. It was titled: ""Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record"". William and Arthur were both part of the Austen family. It was based mostly on family papers and letters. It is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as ""accurate, staid (steady), reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive"". The authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the ""Memoir"". However, they did not go much beyond the family records and traditions they always had. Therefore, their book offers only facts. It does not offer much interpretation."
Criticism.
"In the last part of the nineteenth century, the first critical books about Austen's works were printed. In 1890 Godwin Smith printed the ""Life of Jane Austen"". This began a ""fresh phase in the critical heritage"". This began ""formal (official) criticism"". People began focusing on Austen as a writer and analyzing the ways that made her writing special. Southam said that there was much more Austen criticism around 1780. He also said that the reviews became better. However, he was troubled at the ""certain uniformity"" in them:"
"We see the novels praised for their elegance of form and their surface 'finish'; for the realism of their fictional world, the variety and vitality (strength) of their characters; for their pervasive humour; and for their gentle and undogmatic morality and its unsermonising delivery. The novels are prized for their 'perfection'. Yet it is seen to be a narrow perfection, achieved within the bounds of domestic comedy."
"Richard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen were some of the best reviewers. In a review of the ""Memoir"", Simpson said Austen was a serious but ironic critic of English society. He began two interpretative themes: using humor to criticize society and irony as a means of moral study. He continued Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, and wrote that Austen:"
"began by being an ironical critic; she manifested her by direct censure, but by the indirect method of imitating and exaggerating the faults of her , humour, irony, the judgment not of one that gives sentence but of the mimic who quizzes while he mocks, are her characteristics."
"Simpson's essay was not well-known. It did not a lot of influence until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Margaret Oliphant was another important writer whose criticism of Austen did not have much influence. She described Austen as ""armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint (control),' with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose works are very 'calm and cold and keen'"". This kind of criticism was not fully developed until the 1970s. This was when feminist literary criticism began."
"Austen's works had been in print in the United States from 1832. However, it was only after 1870 that Americans began seriously considering Austen's works. As Southam says, ""for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic"". Austen was not democratic enough for Americans. Also, her books did not have the frontier themes that often came out in American literature. The way Americans thought about Austen was represented in an argument between William Dean Howells and Mark Twain. Through his essays, Howells helped make Austen much more popular. Twain, however, used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. In his book ""Following the Equator"", Twain described the library on his ship: ""Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it."""
Janeites.
"The ""Encyclopædia Britannica's"" changed the way they described Austen as she became more and more popular. The eighth edition (1854) called her ""an elegant novelist"". The ninth edition (1875) praised her as ""one of the most distinguished (remarkable) modern British novelists"". Austen novels began to be studied at universities. Her works also began to come out in histories of the English novel. Most people still thought of her as ""dear aunt Jane"", the way she was first presented in the ""Memoir"". Howells had made this picture of Austen famous by his essays in the ""Harper's Magazine"". Writer and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania for Austen that grew in the 1880s as ""Austenolatry"". It was only after the ""Memoir"" was printed that readers grew to like Austen as a person. Until then, literary elites had said their enjoyment of Austen showed how clever they were. However, around the 1990s, they grew troubled at how popular Austen's works became. They began calling themselves ""Janeites"". They wanted to show that they were different from the people who they thought did not understand Austen properly."
"American novelist Henry James liked Austen. Once he said she was as great as Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding - ""the fine painters of life"". But James thought Austen was an ""unconscious"" artist who was ""instinctive and charming"". In 1905, James said he did not like the public interest in Austen. He said it was more than Austen's ""intrinsic merit (worth) and interest"" deserved. James said that this was mostly because of the ""stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, their material pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form."""
"Reginald Farrer, a British travel writer, did not like the sentimental image of ""Aunt Jane"". Instead, he wanted to study Austen's fiction in a new way. In 1917, he published a long essay in the ""Quarterly Review"". Jane Austen scholar A. Walton Litz called it the best single introduction to her works. Southam calls it as a ""Janeite"" piece without the worship. Farrer claimed that Jane Austen was not unconscious (disagreeing with James). He said that she was a writer of great concentration and a sharp critic of her society. He called her ""radiant and remorseless"", ""dispassionate yet pitiless"", with ""the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment"". Farrer was one of the first critics who saw Austen as a writer."
1930–2000: Modern scholarship.
"The light of Austen scholarship was beginning to shine through several important early works. These works helped Austen become well accepted in the academy. The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar Andrew Cecil Bradley's 1911 essay. This essay was ""generally (largely) regarded (seen) as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen"". Bradley pointed out Austen's ties to eighteenth-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson. He argued that she was a moralist as well as a humorist. According to Southam, this argument was ""totally (completely) original"". Bradley separated Austen's works into ""early"" and ""late"" novels. Scholars still separate Austen's works as Bradley did today. The second original early-twentieth-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman. His edition of Austen's works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman edition has been the basis for all editions of Austen's works after that."
"After Bradley and Chapman, Austen scholarship grew very quickly in the 1920s. British writer E. M. Forster pointed out Austen's works for his idea of the ""round"" character. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' ""Jane Austen and Her Art""—""the first full-scale historical and scholarly study"" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short essay about her, a study of the books Austen read and their influence on her writing, and a study of Austen's style and ""narrative art"". Lascelles felt that critics before her had all worked in a way ""so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them"". She wished to study all of Austen's works, style, and techniques together. Critics after Lascelles agreed that she studied them well. Lascelles was interested in Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. In this she was much like Bradley before her. But around this time, some fans of Austen began to worry that her works were being enjoyed by only a few people. They were fearful that Austen was being criticized only by academics. This was an argument that continued to the beginning of the twenty-first century."
"Mid-century revisionist views started to become popular, and scholars began studying Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, adding to Farrer, wrote an essay called ""Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen"". He argued that Austen did not support society's customs, and that her irony was not funny but bitter. He also claimed that Austen wanted to show the faults of the society she wrote about. Through her use of irony, Austen tried to protect herself as an artist and a person from the behavior and practices she disliked. Almost at the same time, British critic Q. D. Leavis printed ""Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing"" in ""Scrutiny"" in the early 1940s. In there, Leavis argued that Austen was a professional, not an amateur (untrained), writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by ""Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery"" (1952). This was written by Martin Mudrick, who saw Austen as lonely, defensive, and critical of her society. He carefully described the connection between Austen's attitude towards the literature of her time and how she used irony to show the difference of how society was, and how she thought it could be. An important British critic, F. R. Leavis, said in ""The Great Tradition"" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction. Ian Watt agreed, and helped shape the arguments about the genre of the novel. The revisionist views and Leavis's words helped Austen to have a great reputation among academics. They agreed that she ""combined (put together) [Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's] qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to (better than) both""."
"After the Second World War, people began studying Austen more deeply, and in different ways. A great number of people have studied Austen as a political writer. Critic Gary Kelly explains, ""Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels , criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy."" In ""Jane Austen and the War of Ideas"" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was greatly influenced by the principal moral and political arguments of her time, and that she had a partisan, firmly conservative and Christian position in these arguments. Alistair M. Duckworth in ""The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels"" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the ""estate"" to symbolise all that was important society, which should be conserved (kept), improved, and passed down to future generations. As Rajeswari Rajan notes, ""the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged"". The questions scholars now study include: ""the Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus (against) country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied (kept) a reformist position between these extremes""."
"In the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's ""The Madwoman in the Attic"" (1979). ""The Madwoman in the Attic"" explores the ""explosive anger"" of nineteenth-century female English writers under their ""decorous (proper) surfaces"". This work, together with other feminist criticism of Austen, has made people see her as a ""woman"" writer. The interest these critics showed in Austen made people discover and study other women writers in Austen's time. Also, when Julia Prewitt Brown's ""Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form"" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's ""Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction"" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's ""Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel"" (1988) were printed, scholars were no longer able to argue that Austen was firmly ""apolitical, or '"". Kirkham, for example, said that Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft were quite similar. She called them both ""Enlightenment feminists"". Johnson also places Austen in an eighteenth-century political tradition. However, she notes the influence Austen received from the political novels of the 1790s written by women."
"In the late-1980s, 1990s, and 2000s ideological, postcolonial, and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book ""Culture and Imperialism"" (1993) to ""Mansfield Park"", arguing that the peripheral position of ""Antigua"" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early nineteenth century. In ""Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health""', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of ""the body as sexuality"", and more broadly how culture is ""inscribed"" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's ""Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style"" (2003) which connects artistic concerns with queer theory."
"Yeah,"
"well, we, we've had, uh,"
"let's see,"
"we had, uh, we had a, uh,"
let me think.
ause We had a fifty-three
"and a, uh, we had, uh, two fifty-threes which is a long thirty minute story"
"Uh, and we had a sixty-five"
and then we had this eighty-two.
Uh-huh.
"So we, we really can't complain about Oldsmobiles, really."
"Yeah,"
we've been real pleased with ours.
"I think we've had, one, two, three"
Yeah.
"and most,"
"we have a Cutlass, we still have a Cutlass Supreme which is like, a seventy-seven."
Uh-huh.
Then we have a Cutlass Sierra
and we've had the ninety-eight.
Uh-huh.
"So,"
"but I don't know,"
"we'll, we're going to be in the market for a car, probably in the next year"
"and the financing is always something we consider, you know, the four percent or when they give good financing through the, the motor company."
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"But, I don't know what we're going to buy."
"I always thought I would like to try a foreign made car,"
"but, boy, with all the auto workers being laid off, makes me feel guilty"
Well
"So,"
Right.
"Well ,"
"You know, and also, the whole, whole thing with noise."
"My mother, oh, she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs, that don't train them"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, we we had a neighbor in Nebraska when we lived there that had, uh, Brittany Spaniels"
"and they're very high strung animals to begin with,"
"but, uh,"
Okay.
How do you get your news mostly?
"Generally, I get most of my news from, uh, the radio."
"And then sometimes, uh, if I've got time, I'll be reading the front page of the newspaper  and just fall off on the articles that I like."
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, also, since my wife likes to watch T V, sometimes, uh, having just being there I get, uh, you know, I have to watch the news late at night with T V."
Uh-huh.
"Uh-huh,"
uh-huh.
How about you?
"Well, I can hardly wait for my morning paper to come."
Uh-huh
So that's the first thing I want is the headlines.
"It's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and I grab the headlines"
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around I just want to get in the house and turn the T V on to watch the news."
Um.
It's really weird.
"Uh, I don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long."
"But, uh, I love to watch the five o'clock news"
"and I, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where I can read my paper"
Um.
"And, uh, since, since everyone is going out and working now, whether it be because of finances or just the economy,  uh, the mother's not there anymore"
"and restructuring, stepfamilies,"
yeah.
"and the children are,"
"I think, I think a lot of society is suffering."
"Not to say that women shouldn't, you know, go out and do what they want to do"
"but I think that, um,  society's really going to have to get used to it."
Right.
And they're not quite used to it yet
"and that's I,"
"The schools or the the schools or the parents,"
yeah.
"Yes,"
uh-huh.
"Um, I'm trying to think of what else."
I have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden I went blank
"A lot of the things, um, the demographics do,"
"I mean, there are more,"
"I don't have the numbers in my head right now,"
"but, a lot of the things that brought feminism, I mean there are just more women in, in, in the demographics, just generally,  in the United States, in terms of being,"
"Right,"
uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I mean, I'm the typical baby boomer,"
"I hate that term,"
"Oh, yeah."
"but in terms of women,  women going out, I mean twenty-three, I remember that."
Yeah.
"What's it like to be twenty-three as a woman today,"
"I mean, when I was twenty-three the issues were either go to graduate school or get married,"
Uh-huh.
"um, those were the general issues."
Uh-huh.
It's got some pretty strong competitors.
"Some of them have reviews that are better than D Base,"
"so, I, I think by now, it's a matter of, uh, personal taste."
"Yeah,"
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use.
I can understand that very easily.
"I've used, I've had a class on, um, R Base and also in Paradox"
Uh-huh.
and both of those seem very easy to use compared to D Base.
Uh-huh.
Do you think you D Base is more flexible or allows you to do more.
Or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days?
"Um, I wouldn't say compatible, but certainly comparable."
"But, uh"
"yeah,"
"I didn't mean compatible,"
I meant comparable.
My brain is going to mush.
Uh-huh.
And what do you work on at T I?
I'm a computer programmer on the I B M main frames.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
"I do, uh, mainly business data processing."
Uh-huh.
I also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility.
Uh-huh.
"Um, sometimes I get called late at night at home because there's a production problem,"
"and that gives me the opportunity to, uh, come in to work and fix it, if I can't think of some thing to tell the trouble shooter while we're on the phone."
Right.
"Um, I also, uh, handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected,"
Uh-huh.
"Uh, there, I know, you know, John Wylie Price,"
"I don't know if you kept up,"
"but he's been protesting,"
Yes
I have
"and, uh, I prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because I think you're, you're more likely to get,"
"Yeah,"
and I think he has legitimate argument.
"I mean you can, uh,"
"I, I, I grew up in Alabama"
"and so I, I have some prejudices."
Uh-huh.
"But I think that, I think that, that from a, a justice standpoint, because we have the option of not watching that station."
Uh-huh.
"Uh, I'm not sure I, I'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs"
"but I think that, uh, in some cases this should be some real opportunity and, and some diversity, and and this kind of thing"
Yeah.
"and I think that, Dallas, it turns out, though from what I understand, has quite good,"
I occasionally go to Saint Louis.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, there for a few days and watch the news and, and think Dallas really does have, have quite good news."
"I think channel eight is the number one, uh, A B C affiliate in the U S."
"I think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he,"
"Oh, really?"
Course he pumping his own
"Well, we, you know,"
"like all of the stations seem to be pretty good,"
it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into.
Where'd you move from?
Houston.
"So we had a, a favorite,"
"So, I mean all kinds of resources and, you know, just there,"
Yeah.
"and I'd give anything to have that right now in my, in my regular"
"I mean you, you have everything given to you."
I don't see why people wouldn't want that.
"I don't know,"
"I,"
"but then, if I was young, I wouldn't see it."
"Uh-huh,"
"well that's, that's it"
"you, you don't have, uh,  you don't have the view."
"But you know, now that it's gone, I,"
Right.
"I graduated from Texas Tech, more than two years ago, I guarantee,"
Uh-huh.
"and, you know, I kind of look back at it sometimes,"
"well that was a lot of fun,"
"but, you know, I'm not sure that, that I took the greatest advantage of, you know, what, I went through there."
Uh-huh.
"Right,"
"yeah,"
I did a lot
and I experienced a lot
"and I, I feel like I got a good college education"
"but just when I got out I feel like I should have spent more time in the library,"
"I should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were, you know,"
Uh-huh.
"the informal classes that you don't get credit for, you know ..."
"All right,"
"I guess our, we're in the process of a home repair right at this point"
"because we're, we're painting the outside of our house."
"I don't know,"
Uh-uh.
I don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot.
Very few I would imagine.
Yeah.
"But, uh, I get,"
I just couldn't
"I mean it's more money that I make in a year,"
so
"You know, it, you know,"
"me being one person with a above the median income, for New York state, you know,"
Yeah.
"I'm a I'm a second lieutenant in the Air Force now,"
"and, uh, I,"
Uh-huh.
"even as a somebody making twice what I was making, how could you put half of that into, to your child's education"
Uh-huh.
"and then just when they make, made, make it to the college years it's,"
"Yeah,"
yeah.
"My God, I can't imagine."
"Well, my, my real feeling about, about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time,"
"yes,"
"you do get an education, you do learn some things,"
but you eventually forget most of it.
Yes.
But what you don't forget is the growing up.
It's really the period when people become adults.
I mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways.
"But, really,"
"it's the entry into adulthood, I think."
"And I think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in as you become, you know, as you gain new social skills, as you become, you know, more of a functioning member of society."
"And maybe the Air Force Academy is a perfect,"
"you know, I, I listen to D C area and the WASHINGTON POST, you know,"
I mean the most they'll give it is the back of the A section.
Yeah.
"Uh, you know."
"I'm, I'm currently living in Dallas"
"and it, it won't even give it the back section <laughter>."
"You just, never see, you just never see anything about it,"
"uh, which is a shame because you go to other countries, uh,"
"and, and they carry quite a bit about the U S on the other hand."
"And if you go up to, uh, Canada, those people are usually pretty, uh, familiar with the politics going on and and the news U S"
Uh-huh.
"and we're pretty, uh, limited in our understanding of, of leaders up in Canada or Mexico."
"Yeah,"
definitely.
You just don't know what's going on.
Yeah.
"I'd, I,"
"every once in awhile, I have to travel overseas"
"and lately I've taken the, taken a little shortwave radio, uh, around and picking up the B B C"
"and it's sort of like, uh, a C N N too."
You you can tune into some stations
Uh-huh.
"and you get some, like thirty minute summaries of, of news events."
"Uh, I occasionally get into some of the middle eastern, uh, area"
and that's the only way you can tell what's going on at all <laughter>.
There's not much in the way of television in some of those places.
Right.
"Uh, but that's a good point about, about the neighboring countries."
I hadn't really thought about it
but I guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it.
Right.
Exactly.
Oh.
"even, despite, you know, diligent washing, it, it got rusty after about, uh, three weeks of use."
"And I don't think it was my fault because I, you know, I had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it"
"but, uh, it was really, uh, it was,"
"I had to send it back after like, you know, the third week because I realized it was like, it was not,"
"something was very, very wrong with the blade."
"Uh, what about you?"
"Well, I don't have so much trouble with products as service."
Uh-huh.
I don't feel like that's as big a problem.
I've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because I've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly.
Uh-huh.
And I'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, the one I have now is okay, most of the time."
Uh-huh.
But that's it.
"But that's, that's probably the worst."
"My daughter has a charm bracelet I bought her that's guaranteed. Uh, James Avery."
I don't know if you have that up there
"but it, it's a very good company. That  sells sterling silver things"
Uh-huh.
"and uh, she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it, a lot of money into it by now"
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
and the catch broke
and she was sitting in school on a carpet
"and when she stood up, it caught and broke"
and we took it back
"and they said oh, this was just obviously yanked."
Uh-huh.
This was yanked.
"it wasn't forty-eight,"
"it was, it was, uh, let's see, yeah, it was forty-eight."
I was in the Air Force.
Uh-huh.
"We did an air show out at, uh, out at, uh, Boone Greene, no out at, uh Andrews,"
Andrews?
yeah.
So what's it been like up there?
"Well, for the past week or two it's been cold and wet"
Uh-huh.
"but before that, for most of the year, it's been hot and dry."
Yeah.
"Uh, like September was hot and dry,"
October.
"Um, September really was,"
I'm not sure about October.
"I think for about twelve months through September the, the average temperature has been higher than normal each month. Um, lots of ninety degree days during the summer."
Really?
Huh.
"It really has been strange here this year,"
"I mean, this whole course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one."
Uh-huh.
"But, uh, we had, uh, you know, all these, we have all these, uh,"
"somebody said, you know, you're either a stranger or a fool to try to predict Texas weather,"
"but. Well, always, they were saying it was going to be the hottest summer ever,"
Uh-huh.
"and we had all this rain,"
"and it really is not a bad summer at all, really cool."
"But all of a sudden, in, in, uh, in October, uh, September, October it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time."
"And, uh, then the end of October it started rain almost a week without stopping, just pouring down, you know."
"There were flash floods everywhere, that kind of deal,"
"and then uh, into of November, the first, like the second week, uh, you know, the first week actually, we had, we had a freeze,"
"He, he'll come home though, and he'll shoot when he was shooting in the hundreds,"
"and he'll tell me what a great day he had, and about this great shot he made and everything ."
"Uh-huh,"
"well I shot in the hundreds,"
but I made this one good one
"Yeah,"
"this one, on this one hole"
"Did you have to listen to long stories about, now on the seventeenth hole I hit it and went this way"
Uh-huh.
"those are, it's hard for me to, act nice about that when it goes on and on,"
"Well, one thing that is a, is a drawback about it, I think, is the cost."
Yes.
"Membership in the clubs is expensive,"
"the equipment is very expensive,"
"requires special shoes,"
"requires special, you know, special equipment."
"There's so many,"
"Right,"
"and then they want to play another course that's not, they're not a member of"
That's right.
and other fees.
"That's right,"
that's right.
It really is high.
"It can get very expensive,"
"and I can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro, because you spend hours and hours and hours practicing."
"Oh, yeah."
Yeah.
And they don't give those sessions away.
"And nor do they give, uh, instructions away."
Right.
As a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if I thought I'd be interested in golf.
"I really would like to have something like that,"
"and I'm hoping that by you know,"
"that's like, right now,"
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now.
"But I keep saying lets put it off, lets put it off, because I'm hoping they'll get so many better features."
"Yeah,"
like what?
"Well, just like that air bag."
I think that thing is fantastic.
"Because I've seen some of the, you know, like the head on collision type things, when they had it and people walk away from it."
Yeah.
"We had one here,"
"I guess it was about three weeks ago,"
"and the people walked away from the, wreck, with no scratches nothing. You know, a few bruises."
That's .
"did you see the, uh,"
"I don't know if it was TWENTY-TWENTY, last Thursday or Friday night on, on seat belts?"
Uh-huh.
Did that scare you a little bit? With the lady being thrown out and run over.
Uh-huh.
You got it.
"I, I, tell you what,"
"I would not, I would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door."
that really
"I, I guess, I,"
"that, that a little more than scared me,"
"that irritated me, uh,"
"that,"
"because it, it, it surely didn't come as a surprise that, that if the door came open the lady would fall out,"
"I mean, and,"
"Well, you know what the average person,"
would you ever have thought of that?
"and there was discussion for a while about, uh, building a garbage burning, uh, electric generation plant"
Uh-huh.
"but it just wasn't cost effective, at the time."
Oh.
"And there's, there's a little recycling trucks and things throughout the city"
"but there isn't any, uh, advertising campaign."
There's just not any push to recycle.
Huh.
"I recycle my newspapers and, uh, my aluminum stuff."
"Right,"
that's what I do.
"But, uh, they make it as hard as possible,"
it's not very convenient to do.
"Right,"
when they put centers and stuff like that.
Uh-huh.
"Yeah,"
"well we have those, uh, which I think is one of the best things is those cash for cans."
I don't know if you all have those things around.
Yes.
"And I really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center,"
and you can just stop by.
"Now everything else like the uh, paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers"
"but, but for aluminum that's real nice"
Uh-huh.
and I started doing that at work.
"Um, I put out a, a trash can and, and for people to put their aluminum cans in,"
Uh-huh.
"and that's really helped a lot,"
"I mean, everybody's pitched in"
"and, you know, it doesn't bother them to walk little bit farther put their aluminum in a can rather than just throwing it in their trash can."
Yeah.
and I think that's wrong.
"I,"
I agree
"and, and, uh, I, I also think we extend too much help to other, uh, countries"
we need enough help here in this country.
That's right.
They're still people starving people here *They're There're
why should we help starving people somewhere else.
Yeah.
And I think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble.
Absolutely.
"Now I can't wait for, uh,"
"I, I could just picture what's going to happen here in the not to distant future."
"We keep hearing well, we're going to receive, uh, eight billion dollars from Japan for the, uh, uh-huh, the, the, the big, war over there in the Mideast."
The war.
Uh-huh.
"And, uh, so many billions of dollars here and there and everything"
"and, uh, the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to Poland"
"and say, well, just forget it."
Yeah.
And I think that's a mistake.
"Oh, definitely."
"Somewhere, you know, we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away."
"Well, another thing now they keep decontrolling different things."
"First, it was the airlines then it was banks and, and, uh, um, savings association, and whatnot."
We know what trouble they got into
Exactly.
"And the same with the airlines back in the days when they were, uh, controlled and, and, uh, Transcontinental or, um, um, Interstate, uh, Trucking."
"I mean, as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that, they just went to hell in a hand basket."
Yeah.
Prices went sky high.
"Then, in, in the case of airlines, of course, they became highly competitive"
but it's something like that.
"Yeah,"
years ago.
"They sort of move up to levels,"
"and, and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough,"
"and as it turns out, you know, they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that."
Oh.
So you can guess the rest of the plot.
"It actually, it's, it's really funny because they run through, you know, what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives."
"Oh, yeah."
And then defend it.
And that's pretty good actually.
"Well, I guess that's where the title comes from then."
Yeah.
And it's
you actually have to go up there
"and you have a, they have an attorney for, you know, attorney for you and attorney,"
"a defense and a prosecution,"
"and you know, the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level,"
"and the defense's job is to make sure that you, you do, you know."
"It's, uh, it's a neat little story actually."
"Yeah,"
it is.
"I was, I was, I went thinking it'll be okay, not great,"
and then I actually came away thinking it was really pretty good.
"So,"
"It's funny,"
"we've got a couple of movies out recently, GHOSTS and DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, that have to do with, uh, after life, I guess."
Yeah.
"And it kind of makes you wonder,"
"I'm also, besides working at T I, I'm a graduate student at North Texas and working on master's in communication."
"It's the behavioral science part of communication,"
"Well, I'm, uh, I, I was just, uh, in high school I guess when it, when it ended."
Uh-huh.
"Ended up being,"
"I was in the last, last lottery."
Yeah.
And I was glad it was over by then.
Right.
I've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there.
"Just because, you know, we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like."
Yeah.
"You know, we, uh,"
"those people that I know,"
"I work with several that were over there,"
"and for some of them it was just kind of, I don't know, not so much a holiday,"
I guess that's how they tend to talk about it. But that they just kind of lived out in the woods
"and ever now and then, they'd go and shoot their rifles"
"and then they'd, come back"
and you know.
But that they weren't really allowed to do anything.
"I, uh,"
to me it seems like we only went halfway. If even halfway.
"Yeah,"
it's funny.
"Tonight I was, uh, helping my kid with an essay on, uh, Stalin."
"And I was thinking in the course of talking to him about it, how, uh, in World War Two, the personalties of Stalin, Hitler and Churchill more or less defined the war"
"and actually when you think back on the big events of the war, it was, uh, it was almost a personal struggle among these three, uh,"
I guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense.
Uh-huh.
"Uh, they're certainly all leaders"
"and, uh, and, uh, with their nations pretty, pretty solidly behind each one of them."
Yeah.
"And I got a feeling that some of that was involved in the, uh, early decisions of the Vietnam war. That the, uh, people saw the cold war as, uh, you had to draw a line and, and defend it."
That would be a really good thing to do.
"That would be a, a really good thing to do."
So it's
"I have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial,"
Huh.
"and what happened was her husband was, uh, involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight"
and he ran into the motorcycle.
Huh.
"But the reason, the actual reason that the motorcycle person, her husband, was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle."
He was just taking it home from the place.
"It was brand new,"
and his brakes did not work.
For goodness sakes.
"And this expensive, big company that owned these motorcycles, um, railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady"
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened
Uh-huh.
and they were following him home in the car. Saw the whole thing happen.
"Oh, they saw the husband,  get,"
That's right.
They were following him home from the motorcycle shop.
Yeah.
"And they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials, um, this and that and the other."
"Every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her,  of a settlement,"
Uh-huh.
They would find something wrong with it.
"Until finally they won and,  said that it was the drunk driver's fault"
Did they really?
Uh-huh.
"but I just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money, the big lawyers, and she didn't,"
That is a shame.
"You'd think there would be enough, uh, people who saw the accident other than his wife,  to, to also, uh, make statements,"
Right.
"Well, I sort of,"
"one of the reasons it's taken so long is I've been working all, you know, sort of half student, half working and source of income and stuff,"
Uh-huh.
so I'm actually managing to do this with zero debt.
"Oh, that's good."
"Uh, I couldn't, you couldn't do it otherwise."
"Oh, I mean I know people that graduated, or that I went to high school with that went to civilian colleges"
"and they, they've got twenty, thirty thousand dollar debts,"
"I mean you could have, uh,"
"Yeah,"
"I think if there's any major piece of advice I'd give, is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt."
Yeah.
"It's not,"
"I mean, I remember seeing an article one time about, you know, if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a, a, in an investment fund, they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college."
Exactly.
"So, it's, it's really kind of crazy."
"It's, it's staggering when you think that, just here in central New York, is, uh,"
"Hamilton College is just a few miles south of, you know, maybe about twenty miles to the south from where I am"
Uh-huh.
"and, uh, they're looking for twenty-two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now."
Really?
A year.
Huh.
"At just a small,"
"I mean they, they, they are it is a select, college."
"Yes,"
"yes,"
I know.
"I was actually, I I was thinking of trying to get a job there"
I heard of it.
"Oh, yeah."
"But, you're talking incredible tuitions now."
"Some, some cases in some jurisdictions, they can do that."
Oh really?
I kind of like that system.
Yeah.
Yeah.
"That's, that's not a bad system."
"But I, I do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit."
Yeah.
"But, the thing is too, maybe they need more of a, I don't know, more of a expert types to, to be on some of these jury cases because most time you just pick, you know, Joe Blow or whoever and a good citizen or whoever and call them in."
Yeah.
Right.
And lawyers blow sand in their eyes.
exactly.
I would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries.
"Right,"
exactly.
Insurance cases and things like that.
Yeah.
Where
"and, uh, there would be more honest settlements instead of this, uh, tugging of people's heart strings and, uh making them cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them  or giving them two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering"
Uh-huh
Exactly
exactly.
"So. In, I think, in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government"
"but,"
Have you had that experience recently?
"Recently, I can't really say recently."
"But I think about, uh, about a year ago, uh, I bought a product from some company down at, uh, in Atlanta, Georgia."
"I believe it was one of these, uh, one of these, uh, mixers. These, like these juice machines"
"and, uh  the, uh, the blade they sent me at first that went into the machine, it looked, you know, perfectly okay"
"Oh, yeah."
"but I found that, uh, it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting  uh, after,"
"Yeah,"
"so it kind of makes it easy, you know, to do a little something for it."
"Sure,"
"because we, uh, we've talked to a lot of people from Texas, it seems,"
"and we thought, well, maybe they work from, for Dallas,"
All right.
I think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight.
"Which is movies,"
correct?
That is correct.
Okay.
Are you a movie buff?
"Um, yeah."
I don't like going to see them in the theaters
"but outside of that, rent a lot,"
watch them on T V mostly.
"I sometimes wonder, are, are they really doing anything,"
"or,"
"Right,"
"well, I think we're going to see a streamlining in the government."
"I just, you know,"
"I, I don't know what kind of, uh, I don't know what, what level, or what, how long it will take for, you know, our country to start, the public in general to start saying, Hey, this is too much. We're not going to pay any more. You know, we're not going to pay for this,"
"and you're out, you know."
"I think we're starting to see it a little bit now,"
"but I think, uh, I don't know what, what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it."
"Because I think, I think we're just getting taxed way too much."
Yeah.
"I mean, right now we're getting taxed probably, probably around thirty-five percent, or more."
"And that's, that's, you know, that's me not making a whole lot of money."
Yeah.
"Well, they got so many hidden taxes, that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying, because, go to a grocery store, something like that, and you're paying a little tax here"
and you
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement.
Really.
Yeah.
"So that really, that makes you think, you know."
Yeah.
It's like your hands are very much tied.
Yeah.
"Well I think if, if you had a handgun though, in other words it wasn't premeditated, you had a handgun, it's the middle of the night, someone's"
"Uh, I've had, uh, three boys through, I guess, uh, some child care, each one of them"
and now they're in school
so it's all over
"but, uh, I guess I would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want."
Well I can profit by this because I'm due with my first in about three months.
Is that right
"I guess, uh, the only rule, uh, I can think of is that I like to look for places with, uh, good respectable, nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that."
"If they're associated with a college or a university, they're usually a pretty good bet."
Huh.
"Uh, I think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something."
You'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child care.
"I guess not,"
I suppose you're absolutely right there.
Yeah.
"For profit  places, I would really look at them awfully carefully"
Uh-huh.
"but, uh, when I was when my kids were young, I was teaching at a university"
"and, uh, the child care center associated with our university was quite good"
so I felt confident that they'd do right.
Uh-huh.
"Of,"
"aren't don't they kind of use them for, everybody kind of use them for guinea pigs? For their for their pet theories or some such thing?"
Yes.
"But, yeah,"
Right.
so.
"Gas, I don't know about you guys,"
"but there's probably at least about twenty-five to, to thirty cents of different taxes on, on our gas."
Right.
"And you don't realize,"
"Yeah,"
we got a sales tax.
"Our sales tax is like eight percent,"
and I don't know what our gas tax is.
I think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon.
Yeah.
"So. I mean, they're hitting us up,"
"and they may not raise it, you know, federally as much one year,"
but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever.
"It's just, I mean, you can see that your money is just not going that far."
Yeah.
"Well, I know they say like with Reagan, they say no new taxes,"
"but they changed the, uh, deductions on you,"
"and that just raises your taxes, you know, they just get it a different way"
Right.
"so, I mean, to me, it did, uh, raise my taxes."
"Right,"
"well, I mean, you could tell just by, just by how much money you have left over,"
"and all of a sudden, I don't know it's just, it's eating me alive."
"Yeah,"
"I heard someone say that, uh, if they would just, something about with the, uh, the defense budget, all that extra money they're throwing back, if they cut back by so much percentage, it could throw back about six hundred dollars, on an average, six hundred dollars,"
"Okay,"
I'll let you start this time.
"Well, how much do you like lawn and garden work?"
"Well, uh, even though it's totally out of my, uh, my degree training, I've been working as, as, in the horticultural aspect, so the last, I don't know, fifteen, twenty years, so Uh, I'm,"
Oh.
Well.
In some places they don't.
In some places that don't.
Do they?
"But, you know, you, you get specialized education now, for instance, take computer science."
"We've got kids twenty years old, right now, that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications."
I know we could.
"And these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches, because there's no comprehensive test that they can take, that would allow them to, to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college."
Yeah.
"You know, I went to college late on in life"
"and I realize that hey, it's nothing but four years of endurance"
"and you might be teachable,"
you know what I mean?
Yeah.
"I mean, my agree is absolutely worthless. *listen; agree is probably degree"
"It's my experience and, and my knowledge that, that is beneficial,"
"but then, you know, like I said, I came in backwards."
What did you get your degree at?
Industrial Marketing.
And what's your job now?
"Well, actually I'm selling computer software."
"But, the two are mutually exclusive. Because, the, the experience that got me the job that I got now, was my experience in the construction field, prior to going to college not my degree, which is I think kind of bizarre."
Huh-uh.
Maybe.
"All right,"
what else could we change?
"Oh, I'd like to see flexible hours. And teaching, shared, job sharing, more of that."
"Well uh, We've, we've, we've already got that."
"Well, see, we've got a little bit of it, but not much."
It would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing.
What else.
"I'd like to be able to, to evaluate your boss"
and we didn't know that.
"We got kind of taken, just a little bit."
"So we're kind of upset that we're having to, you know, pay this fifth year on the car, because it was just not a wise thing."
But we learned a good lesson.
"So, you know."
"Well, five years is not that, uh, five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest,"
but your payments are lower.
"Yeah,"
"but they, they would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher,"
and he
"Oh, really."
"Yeah,"
"he just told me this last week that he, he said, don't you remember I asked them to finance it at four years"
and they came back
and they said that they had it figured for five
and we'd already signed the papers.
"And I maybe, I might have been there."
I don't remember hearing that.
"But, I also wasn't the one in charge of it,"
so I wasn't paying as close of attention.
Sure.
"But, anyway, instead of putting our foot down about it, we just went, okay, whatever, you know."
"So anyway,"
so next time we'll do that different.
"We want to next time pay cash for our car, too."
We want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do.
"When we buy a house, we attended a Bill financial seminar,"
"and he has a lot of wisdom on that, just on Biblical, you know, principles to finance."
Uh-huh.
"He runs a big, the largest real estate company in Fort Worth debt free."
And we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying.
"And if we do take out a loan on a house in the future, what we'll do is pay twice a, twice a month on it, and, because you save a lot in interest, just doing that."

Young, the first President, who was the son of John Young, an original investor with the Dundas Cotton Company (1860–1891) and a now distant relative of Bob Young, the current owner of the Hamilton Tiger-Cats."
"The Imperial Cotton Company at 270 Sherman was the second largest cotton mill in the city and attracted customers from the around the world. Orders were taken from using the telegraphic system and codebook that can be found in Hamilton's Public Library to date. The Imperial Cotton codebook helped workers simplify orders and organize classes of cotton. The company manufactures heavy grades of cotton duck, used for making vessel sails, mechanical belting and hose, railway car roofing, binder canvasses, tarpaulins, tents, awnings, filters and cotton paper dryers.

"God's Mischief (original title: Daivathinte Vikrithikal) is a 1989 Malayalam novel written by M. Mukundan. Like most of Mukundan's works, this novel too is based in Mayyazhi, better known once as Mahé, the French colony after it was decolonised. The story centres on a magician, Father Alfonso, his daughter, Elsee and an Ayurveda Vaidyar Kumaran and his two twin sons and how their life changes after the land is decolonised. The novel won the Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award and the N. V. Prize. It was adapted into a film by noted director Lenin Rajendran in 1992."
"The story begins in 1950s, when the French, the colonial rulers were packing off from Mahé, a coastal town in North Malabar, after 230 years, leaving behind remnants of a cultural history. Those, who considered themselves as belonging to Francophone culture, jumped onto the first available vessel to France. And many of the older generation, orphaned by the departure of the French, struggle to eke out a living even as they remember their days of plenty under their foreign masters. Caught up in their suffering, Kumaran Vaidyar does everything he can to keep the people of his beloved Mayyazhi from starving, but entrusts his own children to the care of his wife, who is no more. Meanwhile, Father Alphonse waves his magic wand and changes pebbles into candy and waits for his good-looking son to return. Through all this, untroubled by the woes of the elders, Shivan, Shashi and Elsie spend an idyllic childhood in sunny, sleepy Mayyazhi. Until the day of reckoning catches up with them and they pay the price of growing up."
"The English translation of the book by Prema Jayakumar was released by Penguin Books India on 30 October 2013. ""India Today"" wrote: ""The translation is brilliant, losing none of the linguistic subtleties of prose and colour of the original Malayalam.

A controversial aspect of this was the withdrawal of Muslim children, especially Muslim girls from integrated schools as secular single-sex schooling died out in England. Less controversial were efforts to encourage religious education in Britain to expand beyond the teaching of Islam. The Trust also began supporting efforts to open private Islamic schools in 1974, and by 1992, 23 Islamic schools were open, all supported by the Trust. Important leaders in this movement were Ibrahim Hewitt Yusuf Islam (formerly Cat Stevens), Afzal Rahman, and Gulam Sarwar. In 1991, Sarwar wrote a book, ""British Muslims and Schools"", which focuses on why such schools should exist and why they should receive public funding like other British schools."
"Human Rights Activist Nuzhat Abbas has criticized MET for supplying literature on sexual education that echos the anti-LGBT views of clerics like Sheikh Sarkawy, formerly of London Central Mosque.

"The Armenian Native Faith, also termed Armenian Neopaganism or Hetanism (Armenian: Հեթանոսութիւն ""Hetanosutiwn""; a cognate word of ""Heathenism""), is a modern Pagan new religious movement that harkens back to the historical, pre-Christian belief systems and ethnic religions of the Armenians. The followers of the movement call themselves ""Hetans"" (Armenian: հեթանոս ""Hetanos"", which means ""Heathen"", thus ""ethnic"", both of them being loanwords from the Greek ""ἔθνος"", ""ethnos"") or ""Arordi"", meaning the ""Children of Ari"", also rendered as ""Arordiners"" in some scholarly publications."
"The Arordiner movement has antecedents in the early 20th century, with the doctrine of ""Tseghakron"" (Ցեղակրօն, literally ""national religion"") of the philosopher and nationalist political theorist Garegin Nzhdeh. It took an institutional form in 1991, just after the collapse of the Soviet Union in a climate of national reawakening, when the Armenologist Slak Kakosyan founded the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (""Arordineri Ukht""). Neopaganism expert Victor Schnirelmann estimated the following of Armenian neopaganism to be ""no more than a few hundred people""."
"The first organisation of Armenian Native Faith, the ""Order of the Children of Ari"" (or ""Ara""; ""Arordineri Ukht"" in Armenian) was established in 1991 by the armenologist Slak (Eduard, or Edik) Kakosyan (1936–2005). He belonged to a generation of Armenian dissidents and was exiled in the 1970s from Soviet Armenia; in 1979 he fled to the United States where he became familiar with the ideas of Garegin Nzhdeh (1886–1955)."
"Nzhdeh was a philosopher, statesman and ""fedayi"" of the first half of the twentieth century, who left an enduring legacy in the history of Armenia, and is still one of the driving forces of Armenian nationalism. Kakosyan praised him as the ""prophet of the Armenians"". Nzhdeh founded a movement named ""Tseghakron"" (""religion of the nation""), which was among the core doctrines of the Armenian Youth Federation. In Nzhdeh's poetic mythology, the Armenian nation is identified as Atlas upholding the ordered world, and it makes reference to Hayk, the mythical patriarch of the Armenians, and to Vahagn, the solar and warrior god ""fighter of the serpent"", as means through which to awaken the Armenian nation and raise its spirit. Nzhdeh's movement took place in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide of 1915."
"Using the Batavia Institute as the basis for its proposal, Batavia submitted a bid for the Illinois normal school in 1857. A normal school or teachers college is an educational institution for training teachers. Its purpose is to establish teaching standards or norms, hence its name. The State of Illinois passed an act to establish a normal school on 18 February 1857—the second west of the Appalachian Mountains."
"Bids were opened by the State Board of Education in Peoria on 7 May 1857. The first proposition on the agenda was from Batavia, which offered a subscription of $15,000, with the land and building belonging to the Batavia Institute, valued at $30,000, making $45,000 in all. Washington, in Tazewell County, Bloomington, and Peoria submitted proposals, as well. After considerable discussion, a resolution was adopted locating the new university at Bloomington—actually north of town at the village of North Bloomington, which was renamed Normal in 1865, for the school. Illinois State University celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2007."
"The building and grounds of the Batavia Institute were sold in 1867 to Dr. Richard J. Patterson, who, as proprietor and medical superintendent, operated it as a private rest home and sanitarium for women, called Bellevue Place. The sanitarium operated until July 1965. The most notable patient was Mary Todd Lincoln, widow of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, who was a patient for several months in the summer of 1875."

"Liouville's equation appears in the study of isothermal coordinates in differential geometry: the independent variables are the coordinates, while can be described as the conformal factor with respect to the flat metric. Occasionally it is the square that is referred to as the conformal factor, instead of itself."
Liouville's equation was also taken as an example by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem.
"By using the change of variables , another commonly found form of Liouville's equation is obtained:"
"Other two forms of the equation, commonly found in the literature, are obtained by using the slight variant of the previous change of variables and Wirtinger calculus:"
Note that it is exactly in the first one of the preceding two forms that Liouville's equation was cited by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem.
"In a more invariant fashion, the equation can be written in terms of the ""intrinsic"" Laplace–Beltrami operator"

Liouville's equation is a consequence of the Gauss–Codazzi equations when the metric is written in isothermal coordinates.

"Strickland had libertarian, socialist and atheist ideas. His anti-British and anti-imperialist activities were widely reported in the English-speaking press, making him somewhat of a celebrity, while his wandering led him to be dubbed a ""gypsy."""
"Strickland believed he was the subject of assassination plots by the British. In a letter to a London newspaper, he wrote, ""The vulgar, ungentlemanly, and, indeed, murderous persecution to which I have been subjected is exclusively British."" According to British intelligence, Strickland was thought to be of ""doubtful sanity."""
"In 1909, Guy Aldred, founder of the Glasgow Anarchist Group, was sentenced to 12 months' hard labour for printing the August issue of ""The Indian Sociologist"", an Indian nationalist newspaper edited by Shyamji Krishnavarma. Strickland heard of Aldred's action and sent him a telegram of congratulations at the prison and a cheque for £10. Several of his writings were published in ""The Indian Sociologist"" between 1911–14."
As related by Albert Meltzer:
"""After the publication of Hyde Park in 1938 support for Aldred in London fell off and he had burned his bridges in London and Glasgow, but then an extraordinary chance ended his days of poverty. Sir Walter Strickland, a millionaire whose family practically owned Malta, had during the First World War taken to him and was disgusted with the British Government after the Versailles Treaty. In acknowledgment of the newly created State of Czechoslovakia, the first fruits of League of Nations liberal idealism, Strickland became naturalised Czech (1923), though he never went to that country. In 1938 Strickland died and left a fortune to Aldred, who promptly formed the Strickland Press, bought a hall, bookshop and machinery and proceeded reprinting all his old pamphlets, before actually getting the money. Then the Strickland relatives brought a suit saying the will was invalid. Strickland had said in his will he left the money to Aldred ""for socialist and atheist propaganda"", illegal under Czech law. There was a complicated legal case which ended as such things usually do, with the money in the hands of the lawyers. Aldred, used to defending his own cases personally and handling courts with ease on matters of obstruction and sedition, found himself outgunned among the moneyed lawyers."""
"According to John Taylor Caldwell: ""Walter was an eccentric. He preferred books to the pursuits of normal young men of his class, and had no interest in sport, drink, gambling or women. His father was disappointed and disgusted. One day when he was having it out with Walter (probably not for the first time) about his unsatisfactory life-style, and the fact that he was nearing forty and still not married, Walter rose from the table and, so the story goes, proposed to the first girl he met, who happened to be the kitchen maid."""
"He gave Sun Yat Sen £10,000 ""to help him start a revolt against the Emperor of China."""
"During the First World War, Strickland donated £10,000 to his friend Tomáš Masaryk's Czechoslovakian Independence Movement."

The Rough Guide to True Crime is a non-fiction paperback reference guide to national and international true crime cases by American crime writer Cathy Scott. It was released in the UK and US in August 2009 by Penguin Books through its Rough Guides imprint.
"""The Rough Guide to True Crime"" is a compilation of a variety of cases, including historic crimes, with sections broken down by the type of offenses and who committed them. It includes black-and-white photos as illustration. Psychological profiles are included throughout by forensic expert Dr. Louis B. Schlesinger, who explains the psychology of serial killers, murderers, hit men and burglars. The book features serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, mob hitman Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski, John Wayne Glover ""The Granny Killer,"" and British ""Doctor of Death"" Harold Shipman."
"Scott's story from ""The Rough Guide to True Crime"" about mob enforcer Herbert Blitzstein was selected for inclusion in the July 2012 retrospective of crime writing, ""Masters of True Crime: Chilling Stories of Murder and the Macabre""."
"The author appeared on BlogTalkRadio's ""True Murder"" show and described some of the crimes included in the book that were committed in the 19th century as ""a different time in America, where people like Billy the Kid could walk in and just rob a bank"" and get away with it. And while ""there was nothing glamorous about what they did, they are a part of lore."""
The book was featured at BookExpo America 2009's trade fair in DK Publishing's booth in New York City.
"In a review, ""True Crime Book Reviews"" wrote, ""From the Moors murders and Harold Shipman, to the murder of 2pac, this guide illuminates the psychology in play behind the most intriguing crimes in history, from the absurd to the appalling.

Kashubian Americans are Americans of Kashubian descent.
"The two earliest Kashubian American settlements in the United States were in the Winona, Minnesota area, including the towns of Fountain City, Pine Creek, Dodge, and Trempealeau across the Mississippi River in Wisconsin, and in Portage County, Wisconsin, including the towns of Polonia, Sharon, and Hull. The Winona settlement is traditionally dated to 1855, but actually began in 1859; the Portage County settlement can definitely be traced back to 1858. Winona is dubbed ""Kashubian Capital of America"", because of the largest population of Kashubians there."
"After the American Civil War and the German Kulturkampf of the early 1870s, Kashubians emigrated to the United States in much larger numbers. While some headed for the Winona area and for Portage County, many Kashubians wound up living in major urban centers such as Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, and Milwaukee. A smaller number of Kashubians settled in small farming communities scattered throughout Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana. By the turn of the century, Kashubian Americans tended to identify themselves completely as Polish Americans, although in Winona (at least) the Kashubian language would survive for another generation or two."

"= = = John McPherson (footballer, born 1868) = = ="
"John McPherson (19 June 1868 – 31 July 1926) was a Scottish footballer who played for Cowlairs, Kilmarnock, Rangers and the Scotland national team."
"Born in Kilmarnock and known as 'Kitey' from a young age, McPherson started his career with his local side Kilmarnock, winning the Ayrshire Cup in 1885. He appeared for English club Everton as an amateur in 1887, also playing for Cowlairs of Glasgow in the early rounds of the 1887–88 Scottish Cup, which led to a protest by their defeated opponents Third Lanark over the possibility of McPherson and others having professional status (prohibited at the time). Another player (Robert Calderwood) was found to have been paid by an English club and the match was replayed, with Cowlairs winning again. McPherson did not return to Everton, featuring instead for Kilmarnock in the same edition of the Scottish Cup before spending the next two years with Cowlairs, after which he joined Rangers in 1890."
"McPherson played mainly as a striker at Rangers, but was often used in other positions including goalkeeper. He played in the inaugural Scottish League season, 1890–91, where Rangers finished as joint champions with Dumbarton. McPherson's first recorded appearance was in a friendly against Everton on 19 April 1890 at Ibrox, and he scored in a 6–2 defeat. His first League appearance, however, was in Rangers' first ever Scottish League match, on 16 August 1890 in a 5–2 win over Hearts at Ibrox, in which he scored. McPherson scored 15 goals in Rangers' 18 matches in the League that season, including four in a 6–2 win over Cambuslang at Whitefield Park on 23 August 1890 (the first ever hat-trick scored in the Scottish Football League) and five in an 8–2 win over St Mirren on 4 October 1890."
"Despite Rangers' successful introduction to the Scottish Football League, they had to wait until season 1898–99 to win the League title again. It was done in style as Rangers won all of their 18 League matches, with McPherson netting 10 times. That remarkable season was the first of four consecutive League titles and McPherson made significant contributions to all of them, scoring nine goals in 1899–1900, seven in 1900–01 and three in 1901–02 — which proved to be his last season with Rangers."
"McPherson also won three Scottish Cup medals with Rangers, the first in 1894, where he scored in five of Rangers' six matches, including the 3–1 final win over Celtic at Hampden. McPherson also scored in the 1897 final, where Rangers defeated Dumbarton 5–1. His third medal came a year later, 1898, in a 2–0 win over his former club Kilmarnock. His final recorded appearance for Rangers was in a 2–0 friendly defeat to Glentoran on 2 April 1902."
"McPherson was also a Scottish International, winning a total of nine caps and scoring six goals. He is one of four players named John McPherson (none of whom are related) to have represented Scotland at full international level. He also played five times for the Scottish League representative side."
"A qualified engine–fitter, McPherson maintained a close association with Rangers after his playing years, serving as a director from 1907 until his death in 1926 at the age of 58. He is buried in Craigton Cemetery not far from Ibrox Stadium."
"McPherson had several family members involved in football. His son, also John, played at Junior level with Benburb, and his grandson Johnny (known as 'Sailor' due to his wartime navy service) played a single league match for Rangers in 1948 followed by spells at senior level with Ayr United and in the juniors with Irvine Meadow."
"In addition, his younger brother David was a teammate at Rangers, had a long spell at Kilmarnock (including in the 1898 Scottish Cup Final where he and John were on the opposing teams) and was also a Scottish international. Elder brother James was a teammate at Kilmarnock, Cowlairs and the Glasgow FA team, played as a guest for Celtic and spent a lengthy period as a trainer at Newcastle United working with Frank Watt; when James retired, the role was taken by his son , whose previous jobs included the Norway squad at the 1920 Olympics, Vitesse in the Netherlands and Bayern Munich in Germany. Another of James's sons was also a trainer/manager who led HBS to the Dutch championship in 1925, while his daughter Mary married Newcastle player and Germany international Edwin Dutton."
"Marjanović was born into a large working-class family with 7 children in Knin, in the Littoral Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (present-day Croatia). He had 4 brothers and 2 sisters. His father, Dušan, worked in the local factory, while mother Marija was a homemaker."
"After completing primary school and gymnasium in his hometown, Marjanović moved to Zagreb where he attended musical academy which he never finished."
"He then moved to Belgrade, where in 1960 he graduated at University of Belgrade's Faculty of Economics, more specifically at the department for microeconomics."
"Upon graduation, Marjanović came back to Knin since he found employment there as the supervisor in Tvik factory. From there, he advanced to the position of financial director, and eventually moving on to metallurgical factory in Zenica. In 1973, he transferred to the Moscow outpost of Progres - a state company that handled close to 80% of Yugoslav black metallurgy and other heavy industries."
"By 1976 he quickly advanced up the ranks to become one of the directors at Progres. He handled company's steel division in Russia quite successfully while developing an impressive network of influential friends and business partners such as Viktor Chernomyrdin (later to become Prime Minister of Russia), and Yuri Brezhnev, son of Leonid Brezhnev."
"In 1979, Marjanović was named as Progres' general director."
"From 1989 until 1994, he was the president of FK Partizan's executive board. One of his more notable moves while at the post was bringing Predrag Mijatović to the club in December 1989. Mijatović, at the time a young promising player from Titograd's FK Budućnost, was very close to signing with Hajduk Split when Marjanović stepped in and convinced him to come to Belgrade. Upon leaving the club, Marjanović was named Partizan's honorary president."
Marjanović officially commenced his PM term on 18 March 1994. He was widely regarded as little more than a puppet of then Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.
"After early parliamentary elections in late 1997, Milošević's SPS-led coalition (with Yugoslav Left and New Democracy) formed a government with far-right Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by Vojislav Šešelj. Marjanović was picked for another PM term that started on March 24, 1998."
"Naturally, Marjanović continued as a mere extension of Slobodan Milošević who at this time held the post of President of Yugoslavia. Here's how sources from the top levels of Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia described Marjanović's government modus operandi in ""Evropljanin"" magazine: ""Prime Minister Marjanović suggests something – ministers do not vote – and then Marjanović simply concludes the matter as agreed on. Of course Marjanović neither suggests nor concludes anything without first consulting Milošević"". (""Evropljanin"" issue #13, 19 October 1998, p. 15)"
"Even deputy PM Vojislav Šešelj indirectly confirmed this operating procedure when he said the government meetings are always well prepared, never lasting longer than 15–20 minutes. (""Srpska slobodarska misao"", Vol. I 2000, issue #1, p. 142)"
"This two-year period is widely seen as the most brutal whilst Serbia was led by Milošević. Marjanović's government (with Šešelj as its deputy PM), passed two of what critics consider to be the most draconian pieces of legislation in Serbian political history: the University Law that stripped the University of Belgrade of its autonomy, opening the way for the government to install professors, deans and rectors, as well as the Information Law, which aimed to restrict the activities of media financed by political enemies; despite this, the media played a prominent role in the 5 October 2000 coup d'état."
"Similarly to his first term in office, Marjanović again took a back seat, leaving the limelight to more aggressive members of his cabinet like deputy PM Šešelj and Minister of Information Aleksandar Vučić."
"On 21 October 2000, two weeks after the Bulldozer Revolution, Marjanović resigned to be replaced by a transitional government composed of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS), the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) until new parliamentary elections could be organized."
"Marjanović continued to lead Progres all throughout his six and a half years as Serbian PM, though he claimed his status at the company was frozen. The company, which during the 1990s started importing gas from Russia (deal personally negotiated by Marjanović) was still officially publicly owned."
"Although allegations of wrongdoing ran rampant for years, Marjanović was never prosecuted. No legal action was taken against him after the new authorities took office following the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević in October 2000. On 23 January 2002, Marjanović was re-elected as Progres' main board president."

He went to school at Fordham where he set an NCAA record for stolen bases in a game (8), and was drafted by the Pirates in the 8th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, but his excellent glove, a quick bat, an intelligent hitting approach, and his work ethic could have given him a third or fourth-round pick if he'd gone to a warm-weather college."
"During the 2004 Summer Olympics held in Athens, Greece, Kingsbury, who has a Greek grandmother, was given the chance to play for the host nation, Greece. Most of the players on the Greek baseball team were Americans with Greek heritage, including North Florida coach Dusty Rhodes, and White Sox scout John Kazanas, Clay Bellinger of the Orioles, outfielders Nick Markakis the Orioles and Nick Theodorou of the Dodgers, and catchers Mike Tonis of Royals and George Kottaras of the Padres."
"Kingsbury, an alumnus and 2008 Hall of Fame inductee of Fordham University and current member of the Pittsburgh Pirates organization, picked up one of the biggest hits of the tournament for Greece, an RBI triple, in their lone win, which came against Italy in the preliminary round."
"In the spring of 2006, Kingsbury was invited to the Pirates major-league camp in Bradenton, FL as a non-roster invitee.

"The strict father model of parenting is one which values strict discipline, particularly by the father, in parenting."
Ideas involved in this model include:
"This model of child-rearing would involve, for example, allowing children to cry themselves to sleep on the grounds that picking up a child when it should be sleeping on its own improperly fosters dependence on the parents. In his book ""Dare to Discipline"", James Dobson advocates the strict father model. However, some researchers have linked authoritarian childrearing with children who withdraw, lack spontaneity, and have lesser evidence of conscience."
"The strict father model is discussed by George Lakoff in his books, including ""Moral Politics,"" ""Don't Think of an Elephant,"" ""The Political Mind,"" and ""Whose Freedom?"". In these books, the strict father model is contrasted with the nurturant parent model. Lakoff argues that if the metaphor of nation as family and government as parent is used, then conservative politics correspond to the strict father model. For example, conservatives think that adults should refrain from looking to the government for assistance lest they become dependent."

= = = Word superiority effect = = =
"In cognitive psychology, the word superiority effect (WSE) refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings. Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords (e.g. ""WOSK"") and pseudohomophones (e.g. ""WERK"")."
"The effect was first described by Cattell (1886), and important contributions came from Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Cattell first wrote, ""I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no connexion as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters""."
"G. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word ""card"", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as ""cqrd"". Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word."
The WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during reading. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using connectionist networks.
"The WSE has traditionally been tested using a tachistoscope, as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope."
"A string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if ""WOSK"" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether ""K"" or ""H"" had been in ""WOSK"". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. ""WKRG"") or single letters."
"The existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have semantic value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind)."
"Other studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word, or the duration of the masks."
= = = Clustered web hosting = = =
"Clustered hosting is a type of web hosting that spreads the load of hosting across multiple physical machines, or node, increasing availability and decreasing the chances of one service (e.g., FTP or email) affecting another (e.g., MySQL). Many large websites run on clustered hosting solutions, for example, large discussion forums will tend to run using multiple front-end webservers with multiple back-end database servers."
"Typically, most hosting infrastructures are based on the paradigm of using a single physical machine to host multiple hosted services, including web, database, email, FTP and others. A single physical machine is not only a single point of failure, but also has finite capacity for traffic, that in practice can be troublesome for a busy website or for a website that is experiencing transient bursts in traffic."
"By clustering services across multiple hardware machines and using load balancing, single points of failure can be eliminated, increasing availability of a website and other web services beyond that of ordinary single server hosting. A single server can require periodic reboots for software upgrades and the like, whereas in a clustered platform you can stagger the restarts such that the service is still available whilst still upgrading all necessary machines in the cluster."
"Clustered hosting is similar to cloud hosting, in that the resources of many machines are available for a website to utilize on demand, making scalability a large advantage to a clustered hosting solution."

The main venue for the conference was the Metro Toronto Convention Centre (MTCC) in downtown Toronto."
"The conference theme was ""Time to Deliver"". The conference was focused on the promises and progress made to scale-up treatment, care and prevention."
In particular:
"Activities included cultural, youth and outreach programmes as well as a Global Village, which served as an international gathering place with displays of culture, food, community, and a marketplace."
"Events open to delegates and the public included The International AIDS Vigil, a public memorial to all those who have died of HIV/AIDS. The Vigil took place on at 9 pm on 17 August at Yonge-Dundas Square, Toronto."
"Well-known attendees and speakers included Governor General Michaëlle Jean, Stephen Lewis (the United Nations special envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa), Bill and Melinda Gates (for the Gates Foundation), Richard Gere, Alicia Keys, and Bill Clinton."
"Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who decided not to attend the conference, was criticized by Conference co-chairman Dr. Mark Wainberg in his speech, saying, ""We are dismayed that the prime minister of Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper, is not here this evening...The role of prime minister includes the responsibility to show leadership on the world stage. Your absence sends the message that you do not consider HIV/AIDS as a critical priority, and clearly all of us here disagree with you"". Canadian Minister of Health Tony Clement attended in Harper's place. Harper's absence from the conference is the second time the Canadian head of government has decided not to attend the conference. In 1996, former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien did not attend the conference."
"A second controversy, that followed Mr. Stephen Harper's choice to not attend, was the fact that 151 delegates who were in attendance refused to return to their home countries – instead opting to seek asylum in Canada. This development seriously hurt the credibility of the conference and many suggested that the Prime Minister's office may have been justified in its decision to not have Mr. Harper in attendance."

"State Route 107 (SR 107) is a state highway serving Grays Harbor County in the U.S. state of Washington. The highway travels northeast from U.S. Route 101 (US 101) south of Cosmopolis to an interchange with US 12 in Montesano. SR 107 was created during the 1964 highway renumbering as the successor to a branch of Primary State Highway 9 (PSH 9), established earlier in 1937."
"SR 107 begins at an intersection with US 101 in rural Grays Harbor County between Cosmopolis and Raymond. The highway travels north along the Little North River and east along the Chehalis River through the communities of Preachers Slough and Melbourne. SR 107 turns north in South Montesano and crosses the Chehalis River into the city of Montesano before the designation ends at a diamond interchange with US 12, while the roadway continues north as Main Street into the city."
"Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,300 and 5,800 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in the Montesano area."
"PSH 9 was created with the primary and secondary state highways in 1937, including a branch that connects the main highway and US 410 in Montesano to US 101 and PSH 14 near Artic. The current truss bridge over the Chehalis River between South Montesano and Montesano was built in the 1950s alongside two other bridges in the area by the Department of Highways. SR 107 was established during the 1964 highway renumbering to replace the PSH 9 branch and was codified in 1970. The new highway was truncated to its current terminus, a diamond interchange with US 12, after Montesano was bypassed by US 12 in 1967. The highway is closed occasionally by seasonal flooding, most recently in 1994 and 2008."

= = = The Impossible Voyage = = =
"The Impossible Voyage (), originally released in the US as An Impossible Voyage and in the UK as Whirling the Worlds, is a 1904 French silent film directed by Georges Méliès. Based in part on Jules Verne's play ""Journey Through the Impossible"" and modeled in style and format on Méliès's earlier, highly successful ""A Trip to the Moon"", the film is a satire of scientific exploration in which a group of geographers attempt a journey into the interior of the sun."
"Since the film is silent and has no intertitles, the proper names and quotations below are taken from the English-language description of the film published by Méliès in the catalog of the Star Film Company's New York Branch."
"A geographic society called the Institute of Incoherent Geography plans to make a world tour in such a way as to ""surpass in conception and invention all previous expeditions undertaken by the learned world."" At a meeting headed by President Polehunter, ""assisted by Secretary Rattlebrain, by the Archivist Mole, by the Vice-president Humbug, the members of the office, Easily-fooled, Daredevil, Schemer, etc., etc.,"" the members listen to Professor Daredevil's plan for the world tour, but reject it for being out-of-date. The president then welcomes the eccentric engineer Crazyloff (in French, Mabouloff; ""maboul"" is French for ""crazy"" or ""crackpot""), who explains his project for a new ""impossible"" voyage, using ""all the known means locomotion—railroads, automobiles, dirigible balloons, submarine boats…"" The unusual plan is accepted enthusiastically, and preparations begin."
"When work is complete, the machines and travelers are loaded onto a train and are sent to the Swiss Alps, where the travelers will begin their journey. The first board an automobile, the Auto-Crazyloff, and journey through the mountains. In an attempt to run over the summit of the Rigi, the travelers crash at the bottom of a precipice. They are saved by mountaineers and rushed to a Swiss hospital."
"After they have recovered, they board a train with their vehicles, and make a second attempt at running over a summit: this time, the Jungfrau. Getting higher and higher every minute, with dirigible balloons attached to the train, they rise into space and are swallowed by the Sun. The travelers land with a crash. They are happy to be alive, but the heat is too much. All but one of the travelers are loaded into an icebox but are suddenly frozen. The remaining traveler, Crazyloff himself, finds a bundle of straw among the debris and starts a fire to melt the ice. The travelers thaw and are happily moved over to the expedition's submarine, which is launched off a cliff on the Sun, plummets through space, and falls into an ocean on Earth."
"After a few minutes of underwater travel, a boiler problem causes the submarine to explode. The travelers are thrown up into the air, landing safely at a seaport amid the wreckage of the submarine. They return in triumph to the Institute of Incoherent Geography, where a grand rejoicing is held for them."
"An optional 50-meter-long epilogue, ""Supplément ""Voyage à travers l'impossible"""" (advertised in the US as ""Supplementary Section of the ""Impossible Voyage""""), was sold separately. The epilogue begins in Crazyloff's study, where he is criticized by the Institute of Incoherent Geography for losing so much transportation equipment during the voyage. At the top of the Institute's tower, he presents his plan for recovering the equipment: a powerful magnet able to attract the automobile lost in Switzerland, the train that was eaten by the Sun, and the submarine destroyed at sea. The plan is a success and is celebrated at a banquet where Crazyloff is applauded by his scientific colleagues."
"The supplementary section was believed lost until the 1970s when the Méliès scholar John Frazer discovered and examined it in the archives of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences among surviving negatives from Star Film's New York offices. However, a 2008 Méliès filmography by Jacques Malthête lists the supplement as lost."
"""The Impossible Voyage"" was made during the summer of 1904. The film, running to 374 meters, was Méliès's longest film to date, and cost about 37,500 (7,500) to make. In its staging and design, the film is symmetrical with Méliès's ""A Trip to the Moon"": while the astronomers' progress toward the moon in that film is consistently depicted as left-to-right motion, the Institute of Incoherent Geography's progress toward the sun in ""The Impossible Voyage"" is consistently right-to-left. While most of the film was shot inside Méliès's glass studio, the scene at the foot of the Jungfrau was filmed outdoors, in the garden of Méliès's property in Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis."
"A print of the film (though not the supplemental epilogue) was deposited for American copyright at the Library of Congress on October 12, 1904, and the film was sold in French, American, and British catalogs by the Star Film Company. As with at least 4% of Méliès's entire output (including such films as ""A Trip to the Moon"", ""The Rajah's Dream"", ""The Kingdom of the Fairies"", and ""The Barber of Seville""), some prints were individually hand-colored and sold at a higher price."
"Parkpoom's second film, ""In the Eyes"", a 14-minute short about a boy's first sexual experience, was also featured at many festivals, including the Asiexpo in Lyon, France, the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival, the Pusan International Film Festival, the Canadian World Wide Short Film Festival, Flickerfest in Australia and the Solothurn Film Festival."
Parkpoom has also served as a short-films competition jury member on the 2004 Nokia Creative Arts Awards in Kuala Lumpur and the 2005 Bangkok International Film Festival.
"Parkpoom's first feature film, ""Shutter"", was co-directed and co-written with Banjong Pisanthanakun. With a story about ghost images in photographs and a haunted photographer (portrayed by Ananda Everingham), the film was the biggest box-office hit in Thailand that year, and was also a hit in Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brazil."
"The two teamed up again in 2007 for ""Alone"", which also was a box-office hit and played at many film festivals, including the 2007 Bangkok International Film Festival, where it was in competition for Best ASEAN Film."
"Both ""Shutter"" and ""Alone"" have been optioned for remakes in the United States."

"Iron Tank: The Invasion of Normandy, known as in Japan, is a 1988 top-view action shooting game produced by SNK for the Nintendo Entertainment System."
"This video game is based on SNKs 1985 arcade game ""TNK III"" (which was released as ""TANK"" in Japan). Set during the invasion of Normandy, the player takes control of a commando named Paul and codenamed SNAKE (Colonel Ralf in the Japanese version, who also appeared in ""Ikari Warriors""), as he mans the titular Iron Tank to infiltrate the German stronghold. Within PAL-A regions, it was only released in Australia."
"""Iron Tank"" is considered by some to be a spiritual successor to SNK's earlier game ""Guerilla War"" due to many similarities in gameplay, graphics and overall layout."
"The game opens with the titular tank landing on a beach, then advancing forward while fighting various enemies that include soldiers, officers, tanks of various types and fixed guns. In addition the player will have the opportunity to rescue captured soldiers (some of which give the player intel); and will have to negotiate various other obstacles and enemies such as armored trains, submarines, gunboats, land mines, airplane strafing runs, electric fences and gigantic rocket strikes."
"The tank is controlled by a standard NES controller: Directional buttons control the tank's movement, ""A"" fires the tank's machine-gun, ""B"" fires the main gun, ""Start"" pauses the game on the main screen, and ""Select"" opens the in-game menu. The turret can point in the standard 8 directions and is rotated by simultaneously pressing ""A"" and the desired direction. The turret will maintain its direction on the screen regardless of the tank's movements or facing and using this is part of the game's strategy."
"While in the game, pressing the ""Select"" button will open the in-game menu. From here, the player can activate or deactivate main gun fire options, read incoming radio messages, check progress on the game map and turn on the automated ""Refuel"" option. There are four main gun options, which when activated, alter the main gun's properties. They are:"
"While advancing through the game, the player will also come across power-up icons—red squares with a white letter in them. Some of the benefits from these include:"
"Like most NES action shooters, ""Iron Tank"" is divided into multiple levels, with bosses at the end of each. However, gameplay is continuous; there are no breaks between levels as the defeat of one boss directly leads to the start of the next level. One unique aspect that separates it from other action shooters is the ability of the player choose different paths to the final level by driving down the path of his choice. Some paths have fewer but more difficult levels, resulting in a shorter game if the player can successfully negotiate them while others are the reverse. The paths break and converge at specific points in the game's progress, allowing the player to mix and match level paths as the game progresses."
"The level bosses are various different, powerful weapons that include giant tanks, railway artillery, fortresses and grounded aircraft. Most have some degree of movement either in two directions—such as the railway gun, or freely around the screen like any of the several giant tanks. All of them have predictable movement and firing patterns and exploiting this is necessary to defeat them."

The occasion was to mark the 238th birth anniversary of Sir Mark Cubbon. Special permission was obtained from the Karnataka High Court, and Police protection was provided. The group credited Mark for being one of the chief architects of Bengaluru and Mysuru. The move was however opposed by Vatal Nagaraj, infamous for vandalizing the Cenotaph Memorial near the Hudson Memorial Church. However, the association defended their move of honoring Mark Cubbon, as his contribution to Bengaluru was undeniable. Cubbon Park was renamed as Sri Chamarajendra Park way back in 1927, but the name was never popular, and people continued to call it Cubbon Park.

= = = Stadtbahnwagen B = = =
"The Stadtbahnwagen Typ B (translation ""Type ""B"" Light Rail Vehicle"", short form B-Wagen) is a light rail vehicle used by several Stadtbahn networks in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. It was mainly developed by Düsseldorf-based DUEWAG, who also built the majority of vehicles in a consortium with Siemens and Kiepe. A small series of ten units was built by Waggon Union in Berlin. As the type evolved over two decades of production, some vehicles have little more in common than their outer dimensions and the basic configuration of a two-part multiple unit on three bogies with both outer ones powered. For the Dortmund Stadbahn, some cars were modified with a central section and a fourth bogie. These vehicles are referred to as ""B8"" or "" B80C/8"" (eight axles). These vehicles have a length of 38 m (124 ft 8.036 in) and a weight of 49 t."
"When the Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn network was planned in the early 1970s, standardised rolling stock was planned as well. At the same time, a second Stadtbahn network was planned for Cologne and Bonn. Because the future Cologne Stadtbahn already had one finished tunnel, that was built with the city's own money with streetcars in mind, the ""Stadtbahnwagen"" designed for the Rhine-Ruhr network was not suitable. So, another vehicle was designed for the Cologne/Bonn network, that was capable of driving though tighter curves. This vehicle, now referred to as ""Stadtbahnwagen Typ B"" was immediately ordered by transport authorities in Cologne and Bonn, while Rhine-Ruhr authorities remained hesitant about ""their"" vehicle, now renamed ""Stadtbahnwagen Typ A"". Eventually it was decided that the type ""A"" LRV was too unwieldy and type ""B"" LRVs were ordered by Essen, Mülheim, Düsseldorf, Duisburg and Dortmund. The type ""A"" concept, which consists of close coupled two-car sets, was shelved and later revived for the Stuttgart Stadtbahn."
"The ""Typ B"" formed the basis for the British-built Metrocars on the Tyne & Wear Metro, which opened in 1980."
Different variants are usually referred to by a combination of their top speed and a letter denoting the engine type.
= = = Training needs analysis = = =
Training Analysis (sometimes called Training Needs Analysis (TNA)) is the process of identifying the gap in employee training and related training needs.
"Training Need Analysis (TNA) is the process of identifying the gap between employee training and needs of training. Training needs analysis is the first stage in the training process and involves a series of steps that reveal whether training will help to solve problem which has been identified. Training can be described as “the acquisition of skills, concepts or attitudes that result in improved performance within the job environment”. Training needs analysis looks at each side of operational area of job so that the concepts and attitudes of the human elements of a system can be effectively identified and appropriate training can be specified."
"Training needs analysis is most often used as part of the system development process. Due to the close tie between the design of the system and the training required, in most cases it runs alongside the development to capture the training requirements.needs additional citations for verification"
"Tools and methods for an integrated approach, Design Integrated Training Analysis, have been proposed and developed. The trade-offs between design and training are both assessed in light of the understanding of the operational tasks. This approach also uses information on recorded critical incidents to review proposed training and to provide traceability between hazards and training. This single, integrated approach to human factors and training needs analysis has been successfully used on a number of defence projects."
"Over the last 20 years the critical nature of the man-in-the-loop has changed from simply manual dexterity and procedural operation to a state in which their decision making, cognitive abilities, data assimilation, communication skills, and attitude are all crucial. In addition the job structure of the personnel operationally involved with modern systems has diversified in direct proportion to the complexity of the technology. This has fueled the need for a formal approach."
"The task of training can be broken down into a number of discrete components, each addressing a different part of the overall learning process. This breakdown is as follows:-"
"The role of training analysis is to build a formal bridge between the available design data and the training media and training objectives, in order to facilitate the transfer of training elements into the operational environment."
For complex multi-user system a user-to-task map is often constructed to present the relationship between the tasks and the identified team structure and also to identify new groups of users that would need to have an understanding of the system. The training gap is assessed by a comparison between the goals and tasks undertaken by the individuals and the existing training.
"St. Raymond Academy for Girls began as a small, parish-based high school with an enrollment of 95 students. Msgr. John Corrigan, the pastor at the time, appointed Sr. Regina Angela, a Sister of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of New York, as the first principal. The school occupied the third floor of the school building built in 1952 and through the years has prided itself on serving a relatively small school population. In order to better meet its educational goals, the school was recognized with a NYS Board of Regents Charter in 1965 and with an additional accreditation by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in 2003, which was recently renewed."

However, she was not a successful design and she only participated in the Winter War and during the first months of the Continuation War. She was stricken from the navy lists in 1942, due to extensive wear damage on the hull. She was moored at Suomenlinna and was scrapped after the war."
= = = Entheogenic drugs and the archaeological record = = =
Entheogenic drugs have been used by various groups for thousands of years. There are numerous
"historical reports as well as modern, contemporary reports of indigenous groups using entheogens, chemical substances used in a religious, shamanic, or spiritual context."
"A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens, and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time, it was relatively stable. They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old."
"The Maya, Olmecs, and Aztecs have well-documented entheogenic complexes. North American cultures also have a tradition of entheogens. In South America, especially in Peru, the archaeological study of cultures like Chavin, Cupisnique, Nasca and Moche, have demonstrated the use of entheogens through archaeobotanical, iconographic and paraphernalia."
"The Olmec (1200 BCE to 400 BCE) lived in Central America and are largely viewed by many as the mother culture of Aztecs and Maya. The Olmecs left no written works on their belief structures, so many interpretations on Olmec beliefs are largely based on interpretations of murals and artifacts. Archaeologists state three reasons for believing that the Olmecs used entheogens:"
"The Maya (250 BCE to 900 CE) flourished in Central America and were prevalent even until the arrival of the Spanish. The Maya religious tradition was complex and well-developed. Unlike the Olmec, the Maya had religious texts that survived to this day. The Maya religion displayed characteristic Mesoamerican mythology, with a strong emphasis on an individual being a communicator between the physical world and the spiritual world. Mushroom stone effigies, dated to 1000 BCE, give evidence that mushrooms were at least revered in a religious way."
"The late Maya archaeologist, Dr Stephan F. de Borhegyi, published the first of several articles in which he proposed the existence of a Mesoamerican mushroom cult in the Guatemalan highlands as early as 1000 B.C This cult, which was associated from its beginnings with ritual human decapitation, a trophy head cult, warfare and the Mesoamerican ballgame, appears to have had its origins along the Pacific coastal piedmont. Borhegyi developed this proposition after finding a significant number of small, mushroom-shaped sculptures in the collections of the Guatemala National Museum and in numerous private collections in and around Guatemala City. While the majority of these small stone sculptures were of indeterminate provenance, a sufficient number had been found during the course of archaeological investigations as to permit him to determine approximate dates and to catalog them stylistically (Borhegyi de, S.F., 1957b, ""Mushroom Stones of Middle America,"" in Mushrooms, Russia and History by Valentina P. Wasson and R. Gordon Wasson, eds. N.T.)"
Quoting archaeologist Stephan F. de Borhegyi:
"""My assignment for the so-called mushroom cult, earliest 1,000 B.C., is based on the excavations of Kidder and Shook at the Verbena cemetery at Kaminaljuyu. The mushroom stone found in this Pre-Classic grave, discovered in Mound E-III-3, has a circular groove on the cap. There are also a number of yet unpublished mushroom stone specimens in the Guatemalan Museum from Highland Guatemala where the pottery association would indicate that they are Pre-Classic. In each case the mushroom stone fragments has a circular groove on the top. Mushroom stones found during the Classic and Post-Classic periods do not have circular grooves. This was the basis on which I prepared the chart on mushroom stones which was then subsequently published by the Wassons. Based on Carbon 14 dates and stratigraphy, some of these Pre-Classic finds can be dated as early as 1,000 B.C. The reference is in the following""...(see Shook, E.M. & Kidder, A.V., 1952. Mound E-III-3, Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala; Contributions to American Anthropology & History No. 53 from Publ. 596, Carnegie Institution of Washington, D.C. (letter from de Borhegyi to Dr. Robert Ravicz, MPM archives December 1st 1960 )"
The most direct evidence of Maya entheogen use comes from modern descendants of the Maya who use entheogenic drugs today.
"The Aztec entheogenic complex is extremely well documented. Through historical evidence, there is proof that the Aztecs used several forms of psychoactive drugs. These drugs include Ololiuqui (the seed of Rivea corymbosa), Teonanácatl (translated as “mushroom of the gods,"" a psilocybe mushroom) and sinicuichi (a flower added to drinks). The Xochipilli statue, according to R.G. Wasson, gives the identity of several entheogenic plants. Other evidence for entheogenic use of the Aztecs comes from the Florentine Codex, a series of 12 books vividly describing the Aztec culture and society, including the use of entheogenic drugs."
"There are several contemporary indigenous groups who use entheogens, most notably Native Americans of the southwest United States. Various tribes from California have been known to use strong alcoholic drinks as well as peyote to achieve visions and religious experiences."
"During the Paleolithic, there is ample evidence of drug use as seen by preserved botanical remains and coprolites. Some scholars had suggested that the ""Flower Burial"" in Shanidar Cave, a Paleolithic site in Iraq, was evidence of a shamanic death ritual, but more recent evidence and analysis has contradicted that claim. The most direct evidence we have from the Paleolithic in terms of art comes from Tassili, Algeria cave paintings depicting ""Psilocybe mairei"" mushrooms dated 7000 to 9000 years before present. From this region, there are several therianthropic images portraying the painter and the animals around him as one (an often cited effect of many psychedelic drugs, Ego death or unity). One image, in particular, shows a man who has formed into one common form with a mushroom."
"There are several Paleolithic sites that display therianthropic imagery. However, there is some debate as to whether or not sites like Lascaux or Chauvet were entheogenically inspired."
"A cave painting in Spain has been interpreted as depicting ""Psilocybe hispanica""."

= = = 7-demicubic honeycomb = = =
"The 7-demicubic honeycomb, or demihepteractic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb) in Euclidean 7-space. It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 7-cubic honeycomb."
"It is composed of two different types of facets. The 7-cubes become alternated into 7-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 7-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,4} facets."
"The vertex arrangement of the 7-demicubic honeycomb is the D lattice. The 84 vertices of the rectified 7-orthoplex vertex figure of the ""7-demicubic honeycomb"" reflect the kissing number 84 of this lattice. The best known is 126, from the E lattice and the 3 honeycomb."
"The D packing (also called D) can be constructed by the union of two ""D lattices"". The D packings form lattices only in even dimensions. The kissing number is 2=64 (2 for n<8, 240 for n=8, and 2n(n-1) for n>8)."
"The D lattice (also called D and C) can be constructed by the union of all four 7-demicubic lattices: It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic, the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions."
"The kissing number of the D lattice is 14 (""2n"" for n≥5) and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadritruncated 7-cubic honeycomb, , containing all with tritruncated 7-orthoplex, Voronoi cells."
There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of different colors on the 128 7-demicube facets around each vertex.
= = = Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy = = =
"Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy or Majjari Narasimha Reddy (24 November 1806 – 2 February 1847) was an Indian freedom fighter. Son of a former Telugu Palegaadu Mallareddy and Seethamma, Narasimha Reddy was born in Rupanagudi village, Uyyalawada Mandal, Kurnool district. He and his commander-in-chief ""Vadde Obanna"" were at the heart of the rebellion against British in 1846, where 5,000 peasants rose up against the British East India Company in Kurnool district, Rayalaseema Region of Andhra Pradesh. They were protesting against the changes introduced by the British to the traditional agrarian system in the first half of the nineteenth century. Which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximize revenue through exploiting lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished."
"The father of Narasimha Reddy was related to the Polygar (jagirdarr) family of Uyyalawada in Koilkuntla taluk who had married two daughters of the Polygar of Nossam. He had three sons, of whom Narasimha was the youngest. His first wife was Siddamma."
"The EIC's introduction to the Madras Presidency of the 1803 Permanent Settlement, which had first been enacted in Bengal Presidency ten years previously, replaced the agrarian socio-economic status quo with a more egalitarian arrangement where anyone could cultivate provided that they paid a fixed sum to the EIC for the privilege of doing so."
"The Polygars and other higher-status people who preferred the old agrarian system ""represented the decadent social order"", were in many cases ""upstarts"" and ""were also the heirs of a social system in which various orders of Hindu society were integrated through ages"". These people were dispossessed of their lands, which were then redistributed, but the primary purpose of the changes was to increase production rather than to restructure the social order. In some cases, it coincided with a punishment because among the dispossessed were those who had recently been involved in fighting the EIC in the Polygar Wars. Some received pensions in lieu of the lost lands but at inconsistent rates."
"The changes, which included the introduction of the ryotwari system and other attempts to maximise revenue, deprived village headmen and other higher-status people of their role as revenue collectors and position as landholders, while also impacting on lower-status cultivators by depleting their crops and leaving them impoverished. The population came to the view that the British were taking their wealth and that those who were dependent on the traditional system no longer had a means of making a living. As the old order collapsed into disarray, the once-authoritative Polygars, including Narasimha Reddy, became the focus of attention from sufferers, whose pleas fell on deaf British ears. The Polygars saw a chance to mobilize peasant opposition both for genuine social reasons."
"Narasimha Reddy's own objections too was based on their outcomes. Compared to the Polygar of Nossam, the pension awarded to his family upon their dispossession was paltry and the authorities refused to increase it by redistributing some of the Nossam monies when that latter family became extinct in 1821. At the same time, some of his relatives were facing proposals for further reductions in their land rights, including by a reform of the village policing system."
"Things came to a head 1846 when the British authorities assumed land rights previously held by various people who had died in the villages of Goodladurty, Koilkuntla and Nossum. Encouraged by the discontent of others, Reddy became the figurehead for an uprising."
"An armed group, initially comprising those dispossessed of inam lands around Koilkuntla, was led by Reddy's Right-hand man Vadde Obanna in July 1846. The Acting Collector for the area Lord Cochrane, believed that Reddy had material support from fellow pensioners in Hyderabad and Kurnool, whose land rights had also been appropriated. The group soon attracted support from the peasantry and was reported by British authorities to have rampaged in Koilkuntla, looting the treasury there and evading the police before killing several officers at Mittapally. They also plundered Rudravaram before moving to an area near to Almore, pursued by the British military forces who then surrounded them."
"A battle between Obanna's 5000-strong band and a much smaller British contingent then took place, with around 200 of the rebels being killed and others captured before they were able to break out in the direction of Kotakota, Giddalur where Reddy's family were situated. Having collected his family, he and the rest of the rebels moved into the Nallamala Hills. The British offered incentives for information regarding the rebels, who were again surrounded amidst reports that unrest was now growing in other villages of the area. In a further skirmish between the rebels and the British, who had sent for reinforcements, 40–50 rebels were killed and 90 were captured, including Reddy. Although there was no evidence of Obanna's capture, he most possibly was also a captive along with his leader."
"Warrants were issued for the arrest of nearly 1,000 of the rebels, of which 412 were released without charge. A further 273 were bailed and 112 were convicted. Reddy, too, was convicted and in his case received the death penalty. On 22 February 1847, he was executed in Koilkuntla in front of a silent crowd of over 2000 people."
British kept his head on the fort wall in public view until 1877. The East India Company reported in their district manual of 1886 that
"The Renati Surya Chandrula Smaraka Samithi was formed to preserve the memory of Reddy and the philanthropist Budda Vengal Reddy, both of whom were born in Uyyalawada village. The committee published a book in both Telugu and English, titled ""Renati Surya Chandrulu"" (""The Sun and Moon of Renadu""), in 2015. It contains excerpts from research papers by historians."

= = = Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery = = =
"Fordcroft Anglo-Saxon cemetery was a place of burial. It is located in the town of Orpington in South East London, South-East England. Belonging to the Middle Anglo-Saxon period, it was part of the much wider tradition of burial in Early Anglo-Saxon England. Fordcroft was a mixed inhumation and cremation ceremony."
"Archaeologists affiliated with the local Orpington Museum began excavating in 1965, expecting to find evidence of Romano-British occupation, but after discovering the cemetery decided to focus on it. Excavation continued for four seasons, ending in 1968."
"The site was located in Orpington, close to the border with St. Mary Cray. It sits between Bellefield Road and Poverest Road, near to the junction with the A224 road. The source of the River Cray lies half a mile south of the cemetery, while the river itself passes by 200 metres away from the site. The plot of land on which it was discovered was 1/8 of an acre in size. The soil is largely brick-earth, resting on the Flood Plain gravel which covers the valley floor."
"The nearest settlement that is known to be long-established is the farmstead of Poverest, the name of which can be traced to the early-14th century."
"The area remained agricultural land lying between the two villages until the mid-19th century, when increasing development led to the area becoming suburban. Several Victorian cottages had been built atop the cemetery, but were demolished during the following century, when the site became ""overgrown with weeds and littered with rubbish"" prior to excavation."
"With the advent of the Anglo-Saxon period in the fifth century CE, the area that became Kent underwent a radical transformation on a political, social, and physical level. In the preceding era of Roman Britain, the area had been administered as the ""civitas"" of ""Cantiaci"", a part of the Roman Empire, but following the collapse of Roman rule in 410 CE, many signs of Romano-British society began to disappear, replaced by those of the ascendant Anglo-Saxon culture. Later Anglo-Saxon accounts attribute this change to the widescale invasion of Germanic language tribes from northern Europe, namely the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. Archaeological and toponymic evidence shows that there was a great deal of syncretism, with Anglo-Saxon culture interacting and mixing with the Romano-British culture."
"The Old English term ""Kent"" first appears in the Anglo-Saxon period, and was based on the earlier Celtic-language name ""Cantii"". Initially applied only to the area east of the River Medway, by the end of the sixth century it also referred to areas to the west of it. The Kingdom of Kent was the first recorded Anglo-Saxon kingdom to appear in the historical record, and by the end of the sixth century, it had become a significant political power, exercising hegemony over large parts of southern and eastern Britain. At the time, Kent had strong trade links with Francia, while the Kentish royal family married members of Francia's Merovingian dynasty, who were already Christian. Kentish King Æthelberht was the overlord of various neighbouring kingdoms when he converted to Christianity in the early seventh century as a result of Augustine of Canterbury and the Gregorian mission, who had been sent by Pope Gregory to replace England's pagan beliefs with Christianity. It was in this context that the Polhill cemetery was in use."
"Kent has a wealth of Early Medieval funerary archaeology. The earliest excavation of Anglo-Saxon Kentish graves was in the 17th century, when antiquarians took an increasing interest in the material remains of the period. In the ensuing centuries, antiquarian interest gave way to more methodical archaeological investigation, and prominent archaeologists like Bryan Faussett, James Douglas, Cecil Brent, George Payne, and Charles Roach Smith ""dominated"" archaeological research in Kent."
"The Fordcroft cemetery contained a mixture of cremation and inhumation burials. The two forms of burial were interspersed within the cemetery, leading excavators to believe that they were contemporary with each other. Archaeologists have discovered a total of 19 cremations and 52 inhumations from the site. Due to the grave goods found at the site, Tester suggested that the site was probably active as a place of burial between ""circa"" 450 and 550 CE. He noted that culturally, the artefacts and forms of burial were similar to those found around the Thames Valley."
"There is evidence of nearby Romano-British occupation, which numismatic evidence shows extended to at least ""c"". 370. and Tester suggested that the Anglo-Saxons might have intentionally adopted Fordcroft as a cemetery site because of this. Equally, he thought it possible that the reuse of the site was simply fortuitous."
"Many of the skeletons were heavily decayed, although in many cases the teeth and long bones were sufficiently preserved for osteoarchaeologists to determine the age and sex of the individual."
"Most of the inhumation graves had the head facing westward, though in some cases they instead faced south. Most of the grave cuts were roughly rectangular with rounded corners, but some were less regular in form."
"Due to 19th century construction on the site, it was impossible for the archaeologists to accurately determine where the Anglo-Saxon ground level had been, and therefore how deep the graves had been cut."
"In the 1940s, a service trench had been excavated in the adjacent Bellefield Road by workmen, who revealed pieces of Romano-British pottery. Archaeologist A. Eldridge published this discovery in the ""Archaeologia Cantiana"" journal, suggesting that there might have been a building dating to Roman Britain nearby. In the 1960s, local archaeologists decided to test this theory by investigating the derelict site at Fordcroft following the demolition of the houses on that site. Test excavation took place at the site from July 1965, sponsored by Orpington Museum, under the authority of the London Borough of Bromley, to whom the site legally belonged. The borough council provided a mechanical digger to remove surface rubble, allowing excavation to commence. Much of the investigation was organised by M. Bowen, curator of Orpington Museum, where the site finds were initially stored."
"The first archaeological discoveries at the site were Romano-British in origin, although no evidence of buildings from this period were discovered. Soon, an Anglo-Saxon cremation urn was found, followed by several inhumations, revealing that this had been the site of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. Thenceforth, the excavation of the cemetery became the primary objective of the archaeologists. In the first two-seasons' work, 16 cremations and 29 inhumations were discovered. At the time of its discovery, it was recognised as the first ""well-authenticated"" archaeological evidence for Anglo-Saxon settlement along the River Cray. Elderly members of the community who had formerly lived in the cottages on the site visited the excavation, providing ""likely and amusing comments"" following the revelation that they had dwelt above a cemetery."
"A test pit was opened in the garage of No. 17 Poverest Road, uncovering another grave, and it is believed that further burials might be located under the house. The team excavated all available areas, although were unable to dig under either of the roads enclosing the site, or under the houses to the east and west."

"In July, the Byzantine army, comprising a large contingent of Alans as well as many Turcopoles, confronted the Catalans and their own Turkish allies near Apros in Thrace. Despite the Imperial Army's numerical superiority, the Alans withdrew after the first charge, whereupon the Turcopoles deserted ""en block"" to the Catalans.

"England began the tournament in the same vein as they finished it, winning the opening match 5–1 against Wales at the Alexandra Recreation Ground in Crewe. Wales responded to this, and to their shock defeat by Ireland the year previously with an 11–0 thrashing of the visiting Irish, a Welsh record scoreline which remains standing after nearly 120 years. Any hopes of a recovery for the Welsh were however dashed in their final game when Scotland administered a 5–1 beating in Edinburgh."
"England returned to the fray and gained revenge for their narrow defeat in the deciding match of the previous year when they in turn thrashed Scotland 5–0 in London, leaving only the weak Irish in between them and the trophy. Before this however, Ireland received another massive defeat at the hands of Scotland, who beat them 2–10 in Belfast to take second place. In the final game, England needed only a draw to secure the title but managed a win by five goals to one to take their first undisputed championship."

"""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are a class of three multipurpose mine countermeasure vessels (MCMV) ordered by the Finnish Navy. The nearly 250 million euro contract was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.p.A. in 2006. Initially, all three vessels were scheduled to be delivered by 2014 and the class was expected to achieve operational readiness by 2015, but there have been various delays and the last vessel was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016."
"The ""Katanpää"" class is expected to remain in service until 2040–2042."
"In its safety and defence policy report of 2004 the Finnish Government announced that, in addition to training mobile coastal troops and protecting sea traffic, the Finnish Navy would start focusing on developing its mine countermeasure capabilities. As a result a decision was made to retire the aging ""Kuha""-class minesweepers and invest in a new mine countermeasure fleet, which would include minehunters and -sweepers, divers and a new mine warfare information system."
"A request for bids was published on 5 June 2004 and by 3 January 2005 the Finnish Navy had received offers from seven shipyards, both domestic and foreign. After an extensive evaluation it was decided to continue negotiations with Intermarine S.p.A of Italy. Kockums AB of Sweden and Navantia SA from Spain. Aker Finnyards Oy (Finland), Armaris SA (France), Lürssen Werft GmbH and Abeking & Rasmussen GmbH (both German) were left out. In November 2006 the contract for three mine countermeasure vessels was awarded to the Italian shipyard Intermarine S.P.A. The total order worth was 244.8 million euros and it will include a spare parts package. About 50% of the total cost is contracted for Finnish companies and the shipbuilding contract includes a 100% offset agreement."
"The construction of the first vessel began in July 2007 with the ceremony of ""start of lamination"" which, for vessels built of composite materials, equals to the steel cutting ceremony. The construction of the second vessel was started in March 2008 and the third vessel in February 2009. The construction of the vessels was delayed by one year after the shipyard was devastated by a flood in early 2009. Two more floods occurred in late 2009, but the damage was not as extensive."
"The lead vessel of the class, ""Katanpää"", began its sea trials in March 2011, but due to additional delays it was not delivered until 4 May 2012. The vessel was shipped to Finland onboard BigLift heavy lift vessel ""Happy Dover"" which left Italy on 21 May. ""Katanpää"" was presented to the public in Helsinki on 9 July 2012, the 94th anniversary of the Finnish Navy. The second vessel, ""Purunpää"", was delivered to the Finnish Navy on 20 August 2013 and arrived in Turku onboard ""Happy Dynamic"" one month later. The third vessel, initially expected by 2015, was handed over to the Finnish Navy in November 2016 and will arrive in Finland in December."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are expected to remain in service until 2040-2042."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels were initially referred to as the MCMV 2010 class after the mine countermeasure development project and ""MITO class"" after the Finnish word for mine countermeasures, ""miinantorjunta"". As naval vessel classes of the Finnish Navy are traditionally named after the lead ship of the class, the new class of mine countermeasure vessels received its final name when the first vessel was named ""Katanpää"" (pennant number 40) on 16 June 2009. The second vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class received its name, ""Purunpää"" (41), on 26 September 2010 and the third one was named ""Vahterpää"" (42) on 3 November 2011."
"The vessels have been named after historical locations, Katanpää being an old island fortress and naval port outside Kustavi in Western Finland, Purunpää an old harbor site in Dragsfjärd and Vahterpää an old naval base outside Loviisa in the Gulf of Finland. The same names were also carried by three of the four BYMS class minesweepers operated by the Finnish Navy in the 1950s. For the new class of vessels, the Finnish Navy has adopted a new prefix ""MHC"" which stands for ""Mine Hunter Coastal""."
"The ""Katanpää""-class mine countermeasure vessels are constructed of laminated composite materials. They are long and have a beam of and a draft of . The hull, decks and bulkheads are made of fiberglass, which in places are up to thick. The decks are additionally reinforced with balsa and carbon fiber. This improves shock resistance against underwater explosions and reduces the vessels' magnetic, noise and pressure signatures that could detonate the mines. The low-signature diesel-electric propulsion system consists of two MTU 8V-396-TE74 high-speed diesel engines, each producing , and two Voith Schneider propellers. The ""Katanpää""-class vessels are designed to operate in archipelagoes, coastal regions and open seas, and are capable of operating in ice. They will have a service speed of and a maximum range of ."
"The ""Katanpää""-class vessels will be equipped with an extensive array of equipment to search for, locate and destroy naval mines, ranging from two autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV) and two remotely operated vehicles (ROV) to hull-mounted sensors. The larger AUV, HUGIN (High Precision Untethered Geosurvey and Inspection system), which is manufactured by Kongsberg Maritime, is over four meters long and weighs over . It is equipped with a multibeam echosounder (MBES), a smaller version of the one mounted on the hull of the vessel. This instrument is used to collect topographic information of the seabed and a synthetic aperture side-scanning sonar can be used to detect and classify targets. The smaller AUV, REMUS 100 (Remote Environmental Monitoring Unit), weighs only and can be used to collect information of the sea floor with its side-scanning sonar at depths of up to 100 metres. Two ROVs, a Double Eagle by Saab Underwater Systems of Sweden and SeaFox I by Atlas Elektronik of Germany, can be used to identify and destroy naval mines. The hull-mounted sensors include a Kongsberg EM-710 RD multibeam echosounder and a TOPAS (Topographic Parametric Sonar) sediment echosounder with jets that can penetrate the uppermost strata of the seabed. In addition the vessels will be equipped with American-made Klein Associates Klein 5500 towed side-scanning sonars. Underwater positioning is provided with Kongsberg HiPAP 500 (High Precision Acoustic Positioning) system. The vessels follow a toolbox principle in which a suitable combination of sensors and equipment is selected individually for each mission according to the task and environmental conditions."
"Each vessel of the ""Katanpää"" class is equipped with a Bofors 40 mm L/70 gun for self-defence. The fire control is provided by Atlas Elektronik and the integrated system utilizes EOTS TV/IR multisensors. The system can be controlled from either one of five consoles in the combat information center or from the bridge, although only one console is equipped with the pedals required to control the gun. In addition the vessels are armed with depth charges."

= = = Resilience (engineering and construction) = = =
"In the fields of engineering and construction, resilience is the ability to absorb or avoid damage without suffering complete failure and is an objective of design, maintenance and restoration for buildings and infrastructure, as well as communities. A more comprehensive definition is that it is the ability to respond, absorb, and adapt to, as well as recover in a disruptive event. A resilient structure/system/community is expected to be able to resist to an extreme event with minimal damages and functionality disruptions during the event; after the event, it should be able to rapidly recovery its functionality similar to or even better than the pre-event level."
"The concept of resilience originated from ecology and then gradually applied to other fields. It is related to that of vulnerability. Both terms are specific to the event perturbation, meaning that a system/infrastructure/community may be more vulnerable or less resilient to one event than another one. However, they are not the same. One obvious difference is that vulnerability focuses on the evaluation of system susceptibility in the pre-event phase; resilience emphasizes the dynamic features in the pre-event, during-event, and post-event phases."
"Resilience is a multi-facet property, covering four dimensions: technical, organization, social and economic. Therefore, using one metric may not be representative to describe and quantify resilience. In engineering, resilience is characterized by four Rs: robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity. Current research studies have developed various ways to quantify resilience from multiple aspects, such as functionality- and socioeconomic- related aspects."
"The first influential quantitative resilience metric based on the functionality recovery curve was proposed by Bruneau et al., where resilience is quantified as the resilience loss as follows."
formula_1
where formula_2 is the functionality at time formula_3; formula_4 is the time when the event strikes; formula_5 is the time when the functionality full recovers.
"The resilience loss is a metric of only positive value. It has the advantage of being easily generalized to different structures, infrastructures, and communities. This definition assumes that the functionality is 100% pre-event and will eventually be recovered to a full functionality of 100%. This may not be true in practice. A system may be partially functional when a hurricane strikes and may not be fully recovered due to uneconomic cost-benefit ratio."
"Resilience index is a normalized metric between 0 and 1, computed from the functionality recovery curve."
formula_6
where formula_2 is the functionality at time formula_3; formula_4 is the time when the event strikes; formula_10 is the time horizon of interest.
"Thomas Tredgold was the introduced the concept of resilience in 1818 in England. The term was used to describe a property in the strength of timber, as beams were bent and deformed to support heavy load. Tredgold found the timber durable and did not burn readily, despite being planted in bad soil conditions and exposed climates. Resilience was then refined by Mallett in 1856 in relation to the capacity of specific materials to withstand specific disturbances. These definitions can be used in engineering resilience due to the application of a single material that has a stable equilibrium regime rather than the complex adaptive stability of larger systems."
"In his paper ""Resilience and Stability of Ecological systems"" (1973), C.S. Holling first explored the topic of resilience through its application to the field of ecology. Ecological resilience was defined as a ""measure of the persistence of systems and of their ability to absorb change and disturbance and still maintain the same relationships between state variables."" Holling found that such a framework can be applied to other forms of resilience. The application to ecosystems was later used to draw into other manners of human, cultural and social applications. The random events described by Holling are not only climatic, but instability to neutral systems can occur through the impact of fires, the changes in forest community or the process of fishing. Stability, on the other hand, is the ability of a system to return to an equilibrium state after a temporary disturbance. Multiple state systems rather than objects should b studied as the world is a heterogeneous space with various biological, physical and chemical characteristics."

"In 1980, the North Coast rivers were incorporated into the National Wild and Scenic Rivers system, effectively eliminating the possibility of any projects to divert them."
"The Peripheral Canal, which since 2015 has been called the California WaterFix, was a planned twin tunnel project that would extend through the center of the Delta, below ground. Earlier designs called for a canal to skirt the Delta to the east, hence its name. It would have drawn water from the Sacramento River to bypass the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a vast estuary and agricultural region consisting of over of tidal waterways. Supporters of the canal included the Central Valley farmers and the Metropolitan Water District and urban developers in Los Angeles who are beneficiaries of the water. Supporters claimed it would eliminate the need to pull water directly through this sensitive region, reducing salinity intrusion and water quality problems during the dry season. The canal was included in the initial SWP planning, and the lack of the canal is among the principal reasons the SWP has never been able to deliver its full entitlement."
"Opponents to the canal believe the construction project would do extensive damage to the sensitive Delta ecosystem, farms and communities. Opponents also believe there will be long-term damage to the Delta ecosystem from fresh water being removed prior to flushing through the Delta and flowing more naturally to the San Francisco Bay."
"Governor Jerry Brown had supported a ballot initiative in the early 1980s and has stated his intention to finish this project during his current governorship. Supporters of the canal have a strong argument as water being drawn from the southern intakes create problems for wildlife and changes the natural flow in these areas which would be corrected by drawing water further north. Supporters also claim that the California levees are also vulnerable to earthquakes and directing water away from them protects the supply of water. Delta farmers, communities, and commercial salmon and bass fishermen are especially concerned about the canal. However, Delta scientists disagree. The new proposed canal would transport of water to Silicon Valley, southern California and the majority of it would be directed to the Central Valley, a location with political influence and interest in the canal being built."
"Since the 1980s, there has been interest in creating a large off-stream reservoir in the Sacramento Valley. Water ""skimmed"" off high winter flows in the Sacramento River would be pumped into a storage basin in the western side of the valley known as Sites Reservoir. The reservoir would hold about of water to be released into the Sacramento River during low-flow periods, boosting the water supply available for SWP entitlement holders and improving water quality in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. This project has previously arisen in several forms, including proposals for a Glenn Reservoir or the Glenn-Colusa Complex on nearby streams, which would also have been receiving reservoirs for water sent east through the Dos Rios Project's Grindstone Tunnel or other transfers from North Coast rivers."
"With its large storage capacity, Sites Reservoir would increase the production and flexibility of California's water management system, yielding of new water per year. This project is being seriously considered by the Department of Water Resources, as California's water system is expected to face serious shortfalls of per year by 2020. However, the project has been criticized for its high cost, and potential disruption of fish migration when large amounts of water are drawn from the Sacramento River during the wet season."
"The Los Banos Grandes reservoir was first proposed in 1983 and would have served a similar purpose to Sites. The reservoir would have been located along the California Aqueduct several miles south of San Luis Reservoir, and would have allowed for the storage of water during wet years when extra water could be pumped from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. Pumped-storage hydroelectric plants would have been built between Los Banos Grandes and the existing Los Banos flood control reservoir, and between that reservoir and the aqueduct. The current status of Los Banos Grandes remains uncertain, as the DWR has been unable to appropriate funding since the 1990s."
"The existing SWP facilities are collectively known as Stage I. Stage II, which includes such works as the Peripheral Canal and Sites Reservoir, was to have been built beginning in the late 1970s and 1980s – but due to concerted opposition from Northern Californians, environmentalist groups and some economic interests, as well as the state's increasing debt, attempts to begin construction have all met with failure. Parties currently receiving SWP water are also opposed to its expansion, because water rates could be raised up to 300 percent to help pay for the cost. As a result, SWP capacity falls short by an average of each year; contractors only occasionally receive their full shares of water."
"The disparity of costs to the project's various constituents has been a frequent source of controversy. Although the overall average cost of SWP water is $147 per acre-foot ($119 per 1,000 m), agricultural users pay far less than their urban counterparts for SWP water. The Kern County Water Agency (the second largest SWP entitlement holder) pays around $45–50 per acre-foot ($36–41 per 1,000 m) of SWP water, which is mostly used for irrigation. The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (the largest entitlement holder) pays $298 per acre-foot ($241 per 1,000 m). This basically means that cities are subsidizing the cost of farm water, even though the cities also provided primary funding for the construction of the SWP."
"In the early 1970s, the SWP system still had a lot of ""surplus"" – water supply developed through the construction of Oroville Dam, which was running unused to the Pacific Ocean because the water delivery infrastructure for Southern California had not yet been completed (and when it was, southern California was slow to use the water). The surplus water was given for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley instead. Because the water would only be a temporary supply, farmers were advised to use it for seasonal crops (such as alfalfa or hay) rather than permanent crops such as orchards. Nevertheless, many farmers used the water to develop new permanent crops, creating a dependency on SWP water that is technically part of Southern California's entitlement, This is now causing tensions as Southern California continues to increase its use of SWP water, decreasing the amount of surplus available to the system, especially in years of drought."
"In dry years, water pumped from the Delta creates a hazard to spring-run salmon. As the Banks Pumping Plant pulls water from the Sacramento River southward across the Delta, it disrupts the normal flow direction of east to west that salmon smolt follow to the Pacific Ocean. Populations of salmon and steelhead trout have reached critically low levels in the decades after SWP water withdrawals began. The fish migration issue has become hotly contested in recent years, with rising support for the construction of the Peripheral Canal, which would divert water around the Delta, restoring the natural flow direction."
Water use and environmental problems associated with the SWP led to the creation of the CALFED Bay-Delta Program (CALFED) in 1994. The primary goals are to improve quality of SWP water while preventing further ecological damage in the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta.
"In January 2014, after the moderately dry year of 2012 and the record California drought of 2013, the Department of Water Resources announced that the SWP would be making zero deliveries that year, the first time in the project's history, due to dangerously low snowpack and reservoir levels. On April 18, 2014, the Department of Water Resources increased the SWP allocation back to five percent and that level remained until the initial allocation for 2015 was give on December 1, 2014."

"Robert Eugene Bass (January 28, 1929 – August 17, 2018) was an American basketball coach and executive who worked in college basketball, the American Basketball Association (ABA), and the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
Bass graduated from Oklahoma Baptist University and has a master's degree from the University of Oklahoma.
"Bass' professional coaching career started with the ABA's Denver Rockets (now the Denver Nuggets) in 1967, which he coached for two years. He coached college basketball at Texas Tech for a season-and-a-half from 1969 to 1971. He coached The Floridians of the ABA for two years before the team folded at the end of the 1972 season. The next season, he coached the Memphis Tams; and, at the beginning of the 1974/75 season, Bass was hired by the ABA's San Antonio Spurs, which he coached for nearly two seasons, until the franchise moved into the NBA in 1976 as part of the ABA–NBA merger."
"At that point, Bass moved into the Spurs' front office, assuming the role of general manager. He would, over the years with the team, assume coaching duties on an interim basis as needed—in 1980, 1984, and 1992. He finished his coaching career with a 311-300 record. At the conclusion of the 1989/90 season, Bass won the NBA Executive of the Year Award. Bass would then take a general manager position with the Charlotte Hornets in 1995; in that capacity, he would win the award again in 1997. Bass retired in 2004 (by which time the Hornets had relocated to New Orleans."
"Bass served as the head basketball coach at Oklahoma Baptist for 15 years and was named the NAIA Coach of the Year in 1967. In 1966, his team won the NAIA national title."
Bass was hired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders replacing Gene Gibson. Bass cited a challenge to return to the college game and a distaste for the long pro season and its demands on his time away from family for accepting the position of head coach at Texas Tech.
"In his first season, the Red Raiders posted a 14–10 record under Bass and finished third in the Southwest Conference (SWC) regular season standings. The 1969–70 team posted the first winning season for the Red Raiders in four years."
"On January 15, 1971, Bass resigned to take the same position with The Floridians of the American Basketball Association after coaching the first 13 games of the 1970–71 Red Raiders season. The following day, Bass coach The Floridians to a 123–119 win over the Utah Stars in Miami. Former Red Raiders player and first-year assistant coach Gerald Myers was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season."

"Barindra Ghosh was born at Croydon, near London on 5 January 1880. His father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghosh, was a physician and district surgeon. His mother Swarnalata was the daughter of the Brahmo religious and social reformer, scholar Rajnarayan Basu. Revolutionary and a spiritualist in later life, Aurobindo Ghosh was Barindranath's third elder brother. His second elder brother, Manmohan Ghose, was a scholar of English literature, a poet and professor of English at Presidency College, Calcutta and at Dhaka University. He also had a elder sister named Sarojini Ghosh."
"Barindranath attended school in Deoghar, and after passing the entrance examination in 1901, joined Patna College. He received military training in Baroda. During this time, (late 19th century – early 20th century) Barin was influenced by Aurobindo and drawn towards the revolutionary movement."
"According to Jackson ""Jack Da Wack"" Tally, who was also one of B97 FM's first Bee Jocks, in early November 1979, the station slowly started to work more Top 40 music into the playlist and scaled back the rhythmic titles. By the end of that year, the staff was ready for the format change to B97 FM. This station would be a popular Top 40 outlet for years to come, much like ""The Mighty 690, WTIX"" was in the 1960s and 1970s."
"Kent Burkhart, consultant to EZ Communications at the time, states on his website that Dan Vallie was hired on by the company to change the ailing format of WEZB from disco and dance music to Top 40. Over the years, the name went through minor changes (i.e., ""The New B97 FM"", ""New Orleans' B97 FM"", ""B97 FM"", ""97.1 The All New B-97 FM"", and ""B97 FM, All The Hits!""), the transmitting power was increased, and the antenna was moved to a taller location."
"B97 has been New Orleans' top rated Top 40 outlet for more than 40 years, except for two brief, failed experiments. The first format change was a decision by now-defunct EZ Communications, in which the station changed to a hot talk format in the summer of 1994. It featured ""The Howard Stern Show"" and other edgy talk programs. The decision to return to a music format came in Spring 1996. On June 7, 1996, the station stunted by playing Billy Ray Cyrus' ""Achy Breaky Heart"" repeatedly for seven hours. At noon that day, the station launched a hot adult contemporary - Adult Top 40 format using the same name ""B97 FM."" The first song was Hootie & the Blowfish's ""Only Wanna Be With You"". On July 26, 1998, B97 FM returned to its heritage Top 40 contemporary hit radio (CHR) format. The station became more Rhythmic in its musical style. Then in 2002, it returned to its current, true Top 40 approach."
"In 1999, WEZB was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications. Clear Channel later changed its name to the current iHeartMedia."

= = = In commendam = = =
"In canon law, commendam (or in commendam) was a form of transferring an ecclesiastical benefice ""in trust"" to the ""custody"" of a patron. The phrase ""in commendam"" was originally applied to the provisional occupation of an ecclesiastical benefice, which was temporarily without an actual occupant, in contrast to the conferral of a title, ""in titulum"", which was applied to the regular and unconditional occupation of a benefice."
"The word ""commendam"" is the accusative singular of the Latin noun ""commenda"", ""trust"", or ""custody"", which is derived from the verb ""commendare"" (""to entrust"")."
"Granting a benefice ""in commendam"" became most common with monasteries, and the commendatory abbot drew a portion of the revenue of the monastery but without fulfilling the duties of the abbot or even residing at the monastery."
"The establishment of ecclesiastical benefices was a way of guaranteeing the financial stability of the Church. Real property and other goods donated to the Church were erected as a stable fund, and the revenue was attached to a particular office. The parish priest, bishop, or other minister would have the right to receive the income of the benefice to support himself and to cover the expenses related to his ministry."
"There is clear evidence that the granting of a benefice ""in commendam"" was practiced in the fourth century. In a letter written around 379, Ambrose mentions a church which he gave ""in commendam"", while he was Bishop of Milan: """"Commendo tibi, fili, Ecclesiam quae est ad Forum Cornelii ... donec ei ordinetur episcopus"""" (""I entrust unto thee, my son, the church which is at the Cornelian Forum ... while [the bishop is allotted to it]"")."
"Temporarily unoccupied church property (ecclesiastical benefice) could be entrusted to the protection of a member of the church, to safeguard and manage it until order was restored and a new permanent holder of the position was granted ""in titulum"". The patron would receive any revenues generated from the property in the meantime. Each of the early basilicas of Rome was under the guardianship of a patron."
"The benefice held ""in commendam"" could be used to provide a temporary administrator to a church or monastery that was at risk of financial ruin. It also provided a steady income for whoever was nominated, and St. Gregory the Great (590-604) gave vacant monasteries ""in commendam"" to bishops who had been driven from their sees by the invading barbarians, or whose own churches were too poor to furnish them a decent livelihood."
"In the eighth century, the practice became widely abused when kings claimed the right to appoint abbots ""in commendam"" over monasteries, often nominating their own vassals, who were not monks but laymen, as a way of rewarding them. These abbots did not have spiritual care of the monks but did have the right to manage the temporal affairs of the monastery, and some were driven into financial ruin."
"When in 1122 the Investiture Controversy was settled in favor of the church, the appointment of laymen as abbots ""in commendam"" was abolished. Clergy, however, could still be appointed as commendatory abbots, and the practice was used to provide an income to a professor, student, priest, or cardinal. This cleric would name another man to fulfill the daily responsibilities of the office."
"The practice was open to abuse: favored cardinals began to receive multiple benefices, accepting them like absentee landlords, increasing their personal possessions to the detriment of the Church. The arrangements were no longer temporary and could be held for a lifetime. Monastic communities, from which these grants were taken, lost revenues and gained nothing in return, suffering from spiritual and temporal mismanagement."
"In 16th-century France, however, the Kings continued to appoint abbots and the nomination of the King’s close relatives to office became commonplace particularly in La Chaise-Dieu."
"Following the Second Vatican Council, the Church drastically reformed and, in most cases, completely abolished the system of benefices."
"In the Church of England the stipends of bishops and other senior ecclesiastics were sometimes augmented by the stipends of sinecure benefices held ""in commendam"". In 1719 Hugh Boulter succeeded to the deanery of Christ Church, which he held ""in commendam"" with the bishopric of Bristol."
"These were made illegal by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1836 (c.77), section 18, which is still in force. The Act does not extend to the Isle of Man, but similar provision with respect to the bishop of Sodor and Man was made by the Sodor and Man Act 1838 (c.30), section 3."

"""N""-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN) is a tobacco-specific nitrosamine produced during the curing and processing of tobacco. It has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen. Although no adequate studies of the relationship between exposure to NNN and human cancer have been reported, there is sufficient evidence that NNN causes cancer in experimental animals."
"NNN is found in a variety of tobacco products including smokeless tobacco like chewing tobacco and snuff, cigarettes, and cigars. It is present in smoke from cigars and cigarettes, in the saliva of people who chew betel quid with tobacco, and in the saliva of oral-snuff and e-cigarette users. NNN is produced by the nitrosation of nornicotine during the curing, aging, processing, and smoking of tobacco. Roughly half of the NNN originates in the unburnt tobacco, with the remainder being formed during burning."
"NNN can be produced in the acidic environment of the stomach in users of oral nicotine replacement therapies, due to the combination of dietary/endogenous nitrates, and nornicotine(either present as a minor metabolite of nicotine, or as an impurity in the product)."
"NNN is metabolized by Cytochrome P450, which adds a hydroxy group to either the 2' or 5' carbon on the 5-membered ring. 2'-hydroxylation appears more prevalent in humans, while 5'-hydroxylation is more prevalent in non-primate animals. Upon hydroxylation, the 5-membered ring opens up, allowing the compound to bind to the base of one of the nucleotides."
"NNN is a derivative of nicotine that is produced in the Curing of tobacco, in the burning of tobacco (such as with cigarettes), and in the acidic conditions of the stomach. Nicotine is converted into Nornicotine via Nicotine N-Demethylase (NND), an enzyme found in the tobacco plant that works by removing the methyl group from the nitrogen on the 5-membered ring of nicotine. From there, Nornicotine undergoes nitrosation (the conversion of organic compounds into nitroso derivatives by gaining a Nitrosonium (N=O) group) on that same nitrogen, converting it to NNN."
The nitrosonium group forms from Nitrous acid (HNO) under acidic conditions present in the tobacco curing process. It can also be formed in the stomach when stomach acid reacts with nitrite ions that are typically used as a salt to preserve red meats and inhibit bacterial growth. Nitrous acid becomes protonated on its hydroxy group to form nitrosooxonium. This compound then splits off to form nitrosonium and water.
Some of the Powell-Cotton films are shown as part of the permanent exhibition at the Powell-Cotton Museum.
The Angolan film collection by the Powell-Cotton sisters was also the focus of the special exhibition ‘Tala! Visions of Angola’ which was held at the Powell-Cotton Museum from May to November 2012.
"The exhibition was awarded National Lottery Heritage Funding and was co-curated with the Angolan Cultural Foundation and the Angolan Embassy. Commenting on the exhibition, the curators said:"
"“The objects we had access to, were made by somebody’s great grandmother or great grandfather. They deserve to be seen and remembered by their rightful ancestors as well as the wider public. Just as importantly, the Angolan community here in the UK have a right to be involved in the decisions made about the collection. This is after all their history.”"
"In connection with the exhibition, a research project entitled ‘Looking Back to Find Them Looking Forward: The Visionary Powell-Cotton Sisters’ and was in collaboration with the Pitt Rivers Museum, University of Oxford."
"The project and exhibition aimed to highlight the importance of the daughters collecting practises and material they brought back, especially their ethnographic films. As Oxford Aspire stated in an article on the project;"
"‘The sisters’ collecting practice was visionary in that it placed photography and film-making in a central role in the collection of material culture, something few other museum collections were doing at the time. As a result their collection represents a significant part of the film and museum heritage of the county. Until this new project, however, their achievements were not recognised in the galleries of the Powell-Cotton Museum.’"

= = = Gunpoint (video game) = = =
"Gunpoint is a stealth-based puzzle-platform video game created by indie developer Tom Francis. The game was released for Microsoft Windows on 3 June 2013, and soon followed with versions for OS X and Linux."
"The game is set in the near future and sees players assume the role of freelance spy Richard Conway, who is tasked with infiltrating buildings to fulfil assignments from various clients. To do so, the player must avoid guards and bypass security features with the aid of a number of high-tech gadgets, such as the Crosslink tool which is used to rewire electrical circuits. Throughout the game, Conway seeks to clear his name in the murder of a high-profile weapons manufacturer, and gradually uncovers a murder mystery in his search for the real killer."
"""Gunpoint"" is divided into a number of missions, between which the player, as Richard Conway, interacts with others through a PDA to accept missions, shop for new gear, and allocate resource points among various abilities Conway possesses. Each mission typically involves entering a building and hack into a computer, and then making way for the exit point of the level. Initially missions are provided in a linear order but the game provides optional missions later."
"The building is presented in a two-dimensional cross-section on screen, showing the locations of guards, doors, switch panels, lights, security cameras, and other features, including the target objectives. The player, as Conway, can run and climb on walls, use stairwells and elevators, and using the abilities of Conway's ""Bullfrog"" hypertrousers, can launch the character great heights or distances, potentially tackling guards or breaking through glass walls. Conway can survive long falls, but can be killed by a single gunshot, thus requiring the player to stay out of the guards' line of sight."
"Within a few missions, the player gains access to the Crosslink device. This allows the player to change the view to show all the security features of the building and their current connectivity, such as the light controlled by a given light switch. From here, the player can rewire these controls, within the current limits of the Crosslink, such as by making a light switch control a secured door, or by completely disabling a security feature. The availability of which controls can be affected is initially limited at the start of the game, but as the player earns in-game money, they can buy improved features, such as being able to control encrypted controls or even affect weapons carried by guards. With the Crosslink, the player can then create situations that would allow them to sneak through without being detected by guards, lure the guards into areas where they can be neutralized, or simply to gain access to secured areas of the facility. Other tools to help navigate the building and avoid guards become available to purchase later. The player is ranked at the end of each mission based on time taken, number of guards knocked out/killed, number of times they were spotted, and how much noise or distraction they created."
The game includes a level editor to allow players to create their own challenges.
"""Gunpoint"" was developed by Tom Francis in his spare time while working as section editor for ""PC Gamer UK"" magazine. Francis had no formal background in programming, but having learned that ""Spelunky"" was created by one person with the user-friendly software suite , he decided to experiment with game development. He started work on his first game, under the working title ""Private Dick"", in May 2010. Within about a month Francis had a working prototype which he released on his blog to gauge interest and garner feedback."
"After making further progress on the game's core mechanics, Francis requested on his blog that interested artists submit character and background mockups for the game to replace his programmer art. He described the response as ""humbling and overwhelming,"" and ultimately chose to work with artists John Roberts and Fabian van Dommelen. Francis then repeated this process for musicians, recruiting Ryan Ike, Francisco Cerda, and John Robert Matz to create the background music of ""Gunpoint""."
"The concept for ""Gunpoint"" came from Francis' review work for ""PC Gamer UK"", as he found himself often writing means of suggesting how games could be improved, and considered himself too harsh for writing such criticism. He wanted to make a game that avoided the pitfall of assuming ""the player is stupid"", and instead not worry about if the player out-thought his own level design. The idea of the Crosslink tool made it effectively a type of limited level editor to let the player complete each level in the manner they wanted to. Francis considered that the stealth element was less about evasion and more on simply avoiding being even seen by the guards; he considered that for most other games, player characters can typically take a great deal of damage, and instead wanted to make the player consider the guards' guns as serious threats and included instant death if seen by the guards. The Crosslink tool could thus allow players to deal with such guards without even being in the same room. Francis did cut out one element of the Crosslink tool that would allow the player to remotely activate a device that is on an accessible circuit as he felt this would make for trivial solutions."
"In 2015, the game was ported by Abstraction Games to a newer version of the game engine, with added support for Steam Workshop."
"""Gunpoint"" was positively received by critics, attaining a score of 83/100 from review aggregator Metacritic. The game was widely praised for its gameplay, art style, music, and writing; while its short length was a common criticism. Eurogamer awarded the game 8/10 and wrote ""'Always leave them wanting more,' goes the old showbiz adage, and ""Gunpoint"" certainly does that."" GameSpot's review was more critical of the game's length, awarding it 7.5/10 and describing it as ""the start of something great, but without more content, it feels too much like the appetizer to a main course."" Destructoid gave the game 9.5/10 and called it ""a hallmark of excellence,"" noting that ""its short length might be seen as a flaw, but a robust level editor soundly nips that issue in the bud."" ""PC Gamer UK"", where Francis worked while developing the game, declined to review it in order to avoid any perceived conflict of interest."
"Francis noted that his only development cost was $30 for a version of . He recouped this cost within 64 seconds of offering pre-orders for the game, but since has made revenue many times more than this and recognizing he was making enough to become a game developer. With the success of ""Gunpoint"", Francis announced that he would be departing ""PC Gamer UK"" to take up full-time independent game development, while still writing freelance for the magazine from time to time."
= = = Babillon Tower = = =
"Babillon Tower () is a skyscraper under construction (currently on hold) in Batumi, Georgia. It is approximately 170 meters tall (47 stories). Once complete, it will be the tallest skyscraper in Batumi after the Orbi Twin Towers (50 stories). The Babillon Tower will become one of many new buildings constructed in Batumi in recent years, leading to a renewal of the tourist industry. The construction is overseen by Omer Ilknur and was to include a 4-star hotel, a casino, residences, social facilities, shops, offices, cafes, restaurants, and bars."
"As of May 2019, the Government of Georgia sold the Babillon Tower multi-story building to MC Construction, located in the center of Batumi. The online auction started at 24.5 million GEL, 33% less than the previous unsuccessful auction. Babylon Tower was supposed to be completed in 2015, but the developer of the project TAM GEO LLC did not fulfill their obligations."

"The title ""Hrj sStA"" ""keeper of the secrets"" is attested for 13 individuals during the Old Kingdom, at least once elaborated to the form ""Hr sStA mdw-nTr"" ""keeper of the secrets of the god's words,"" meaning the hieroglyphic language used on monuments. In contrast with the hieratic script used for everyday record-keeping, already an elite activity, the content of hieroglyphic texts was closely controlled property of the state and permission from the king was probably required for inscriptions in one's tomb, as we see in a royal authorization for Rawer, an official under Neferirkare buried at Giza, to do so."
"""jmAx xr nTr aA"" ""honored one near the great god"" is a euphemism for ""dead,"" appearing frequently in tombs and on slab stelae, even though it, like the word (and goddess) ""mAat"", evokes a multifarious idealization of relationships between social and cosmological ranks."
"Epithets beginning with ""jmAx"" are common throughout Egyptian history from the 4th Dynasty on, tending toward greater specificity in later periods. An official or family member could possess several, both ""jmAx xr nTr aA"" ""honored before the great god"" (when dead) and ""jmAx xr nswt"" ""honored before the king"" (presumably in life). It is important to realize that king and god themselves can be one and the same, especially upon death, as Amenemhat I would be in the early Middle Kingdom story of Sinuhe. The goal of kingship, after maintaining social order (""mAat"") in Egypt, was to ascend and unite with the sun disk of Heliopolitan theology, maintained from Old Kingdom until the arrival of Christianity.Since ""jmAx"" can also be translated as ""provided for,"" the connection an official's tomb holds with royal subsidy is made implicit; although officials built their tombs using mainly their own resources once the 4th Dynasty (and Khufu's largess at Giza) ended."
"A two-pillared portico makes up the eastern half of the mastaba's façade. The front is inscribed with Niankhkhnum depicted on the left, Khnumhotep on the right. These two reliefs are virtually identical, only the names being different."
This space is fairly small. The west side is decorated with a funerary procession for Niankhkhnum and the east side shows a matching funerary procession for Khnumhotep.
"At the entrance scenes of baking bread and brewing beer are depicted. Barley is carefully measured out and turned into bread. Other scenes include goat herding, ship building, harvesting scenes, sailing, netting of birds, etc. The east wall contains a legal text. Below this text several people are depicted thought to be the family of the two men. At the very bottom ships are shown. The men are shown standing before the main cabin of the ship."
"An undecorated space which serves to connect the vestibule and chambers on the north end of the mastaba with the abutting rock-cut sections of the tomb to their south. Modern security grates now obstruct much of the full sun that would have flooded this small, walled yard, yet little or no sun fell on the vestibule to the outer rock-cut hall described below, as its entrance faces north."
"With names, titles, and standing portraits of the two men, it is much smaller than the other vestibule and without pillars. The lintel's inside surface features another cattle count scene, and each tomb owner appears on one of the side walls with his wife, amid a flow of yet more offerings from the herds."
"This outer hall, an antechamber to the final, inner hall, marks the tomb's first, rock-cut phase of construction, and is fully decorated. Before the mastaba was added, it would have been the first room a visitor entered after passing through the forecourt, which was relocated northeast to the far side of the mastaba where it is now. Here, people engage in agricultural occupations including the weighing of corn and grain, the ploughing of fields, and harvesting."
"A double doorway to the inner hall is on the west wall, with a broad pillar dividing the doors. Its surface depicts the two men, their children, drawn much smaller to reflect a lesser status, in tow behind each parent. The respective wives do not appear in this scene. Niankhkhnum has three sons and three daughters, Khnumhotep five sons and one daughter, some of whom may be adopted or conceived by a second wife or mistress as they lack the shendyt kilts worn by the others. All the children except Niankhkhnum's youngest son, who still runs naked with his shaved head bearing the single sidelock of youth, are adults despite the scale they are drawn at. Ptahshepses, a son of Khnumhotep, wore the youth sidelock in the marsh scene of the forecourt but not so here. Either inconsistency intrudes, or the art, completed over years, reflects some changes of status which transpire during the tomb's construction."
"Now on the reverse side of the dividing pillar, Niankhknum and Khnumhotep embrace again, and a third time on the opposite wall of this small chamber. They are without their children in this innermost sanctuary. Each man has a ""false door,"" a carved, slot-like niche surrounded by inscriptions which was produced in the royal workshops and installed in the tomb. Niankhknum's is seriously damaged. The false door provided an accessway for the deceased, as a spiritual being, to reach offerings left at the tomb by the living. These offerings were to be set on plinths in front of the false doors. Behind the false doors is a small statue closet known as the serdab. A statue of each man would have been placed here, facing the chamber as if to watch visitors come and go, but invisible to the offering-bringers since the false doors are actually solid. It appears that tomb robbers removed the statues in antiquity; they are no longer extant."
"The banquet scene (first image) shows Niankhkhnum clean-shaven (left) and Khnumhotep (wearing a short beard) seated facing one another across comestibles spread between, each with his own breadboard table. Set off by a baseline, this is read separately from the two registers of entertainment below them. A different upper register substitutes in the contemporary Saqqara tomb of Ti (next image), where no food is present with the owner, who is seated holding a scepter, his wife (drawn at half-scale) by his feet."
"Longevity and circumstances of the tomb owners' deaths are unknown. The limestone sarcophagi beneath the mastaba were ransacked and wooden coffins of later date interred in the burial chambers. Booth, citing others, adheres to the theory that Khnumhotep died first, leaving Niankhkhnum to complete the tomb's art. This conclusion was drawn from Khnumhotep's ""jmAx"" epithets (see Titulary section), a style of beard he wears, and exclusion of his wife at the banquet scene when Niankhknum's was originally there."
"Four of the rows show people walking in single file. Familial relationships stay unclear in Egyptian tombs: Only the pictures of wives (""Hmt.f"" ""his wife""), daughters (""zAt.f""), and sons (""zA.f"") bore genealogical notations. Reeder identifies Niankhkhnum and Khnumhotep themselves at the rear of Khabau-Khufu's line; he and the woman behind him are Niankhkhnum's parents. This woman and Khnumhotep are the only paraders who do not place their left hands upon their hearts, but use them to hold the hand or arm of the person in front of them, suggesting a degree of intimacy between them and the persons they grasp (Khabau-Khufu or Niankhkhnum, respectively). More of the deceased's children plus some of foggier status appear, including Ankhredwi-nesut, police captain Khnumhezuf, palace manicurist Kasetef, and Hemre's wife Tjeset. Sekhem, a scribe of the ""pr HD"" ""white house,"" is both here and behind Niankhkhnum in the forecourt marsh scene, where he had a namesake on Khnumhotep's side, albeit with additional post of inspector of ""Hm-kA"" priests marked."
"In Reeder's interpretation, absence of Khnumhotep's parents here matching absence of his wife at the banquet, is consistent with Khnumhotep predeceasing his afterlife roommate. Other officials in line and in the next register (where figures are smaller) include supervisors of weavers, manicurists, ""Hm-kA"" priests, and scribes."

Opened in November 2003 as the initial professional presenting arm of CalArts, REDCAT has since garnered a reputation for groundbreaking theater and a worldwide arts following as a launching platform for up-and-coming local artists, and for introducing internationally acclaimed productions and exhibitions to L.A. audiences that are often premiering on the West Coast for the first time."
"The art center consists of a gallery space with revolving exhibitions, a 200–270-seat flexible black box theater, and a lounge cafe/bar hosting public conversations and a bookstore offering diverse art publications."
"As the Walt Disney Concert Hall came under construction in 1992, Roy E. Disney, son of Roy O. and Edna Disney, saw an opportunity for California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, CA to have a presence downtown. With the approval of The Walt Disney Company's Board of Directors and support from the County of Los Angeles, the project's lead architect, Frank Gehry, whose children also graduated from CalArts, was tasked to design the new venue. Roy Disney and his wife Patty personally matched the Disney Company gift for REDCAT's construction and, to extend the memory of Roy O. Disney who built The Walt Disney Company with Walt and oversaw the construction of CalArts' campus, dedicated the new art center to his parents' name. CalArts President Steven D. Lavine cites the pairing of high caliber renegade experimentation and a social space for artist-community engagement, especially those in London (e.g. The Cottesloe Theatre as part of the Royal National Theatre), as a pointed consideration for the venue design and its conception as an institutional laboratory."
"Mark Murphy was brought on board as executive director of REDCAT to guide the vision of the new organization. He observed a dearth of interdisciplinary art spaces in Los Angeles the likes of Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, Wexner Center for the Arts, and the Walker Art Center, or the Alte Oper in Frankfurt and the Hebbel am Ufer in Berlin. This impetus propelled initiatives for commissioned works, artist residencies, collaborations, and public programs to facilitate dialogue on the creative city within the world arts arena."

"Round trips are characteristic of the New Economy companies. They played a crucial part in temporarily inflating the market capitalization of energy traders such as Enron, CMS Energy, Reliant Energy, and Dynegy."
"In international scenarios, round tripping is used for tax evasion and money laundering."
"Other companies making unconventional round-tripping deals include AOL with Sun Microsystems and Global Crossing with Qwest Communications. It is alleged that when some telecommunications companies swapped capacity, they booked the value of the incoming capacity as revenue and the value of the outgoing capacity as an investment. These transactions had the effect of inflating profits. The SEC ruled that booking revenues from swaps in telecommunications capacity was improper."
"Many such companies have used round-tripping to distort the market by establishing false revenue benchmarks, aiming to meet or beat the numbers put out by Wall Street stock analysts. As a result of abusive round trips, barter between publicly held companies has become discredited among professional investors."
= = = Militia (United States) = = =
"The militia of the United States, (Not be confused with Militia of one of the several states) as defined by the U.S. Congress, has changed over time."
"During colonial America, all able-bodied men of certain ages were members of the militia, depending on the respective states rule. Individual towns formed local independent militias for their own defense. The year before the US Constitution was ratified, ""The Federalist Papers"" detailed the founders' paramount vision of the militia in 1787. The new Constitution empowered Congress to ""organize, arm, and discipline"" this national military force, leaving significant control in the hands of each state government."
"Today, as defined by the Militia Act of 1903, the term ""militia"" is used to describe two classes within the United States:"
A third militia is a state defense force. It is authorized by state and federal laws.
"Congress has organized the National Guard under its power to ""raise and support armies"" and not its power to ""Provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the Militia"". This Congress chose to do in the interests of organizing reserve military units which were not limited in deployment by the strictures of our power over the constitutional militia, which can be called forth only ""to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions."" The modern National Guard was specifically intended to avoid status as the constitutional militia, a distinction recognized by 10 U.S.C. Sec 311(a)."
"The term ""militia"" derives from Old English ""milite"" meaning soldiers (plural), ""militisc"" meaning military and also classical Latin ""milit-, miles"" meaning soldier."
"The Modern English term ""militia"" dates to the year 1590, with the original meaning now obsolete: ""the body of soldiers in the service of a sovereign or a state"". Subsequently, since approximately 1665, ""militia"" has taken the meaning ""a military force raised from the civilian population of a country or region, especially to supplement a regular army in an emergency, frequently as distinguished from mercenaries or professional soldiers"". The U.S. Supreme Court adopted the following definition for ""active militia"" from an Illinois Supreme Court case of 1879: "" 'a body of citizens trained to military duty, who may be called out in certain cases, but may not be kept on service like standing armies, in times of peace'. . . when not engaged at stated periods . . . they return to their usual avocations . . . and are subject to call when public exigencies demand it."""
"The spelling of ""millitia"" is often observed in written and printed materials from the 17th century through the 19th century."
"""See article: Colonial American military history"""
"The early colonists of America considered the militia an important social institution, necessary to provide defense and public safety."
"""See article: Provincial troops in the French and Indian Wars"""
"During the French and Indian Wars, town militia formed a recruiting pool for the Provincial Forces. The legislature of the colony would authorize a certain force level for the season's campaign and set recruitment quotas for each local militia. In theory, militia members could be drafted by lot if there were inadequate forces for the Provincial Regulars; however, the draft was rarely resorted to because provincial regulars were highly paid (more highly paid than their regular British Army counterparts) and rarely engaged in combat."
"In September 1755, George Washington, then adjutant-general of the Virginia militia, upon a frustrating and futile attempt to call up the militia to respond to a frontier Indian attack:"
See New Hampshire Provincial Regiment for a history of a Provincial unit during the French and Indian War.
"Just prior to the American Revolutionary War, on October 26, 1774, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, observing the British military buildup, deemed their militia resources to be insufficient: the troop strength, ""including the sick and absent, amounted to about seventeen thousand men ... this was far short of the number wanted, that the council recommended an immediate application to the New England governments to make up the deficiency"":"
"""See article: List of United States militia units in the American Revolutionary War"""
"The American Revolutionary War began near Boston, Massachusetts with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, in which a group of local militias constituted the American side (the ""Patriots""). On April 19, 1775, a British force 800 strong marched out of Boston to Concord intending to destroy patriot arms and ammunition. At 5:00 in the morning at Lexington, they met about 70 armed militiamen whom they ordered to disperse, but the militiamen refused. Firing ensued; it is not clear which side opened fire. This became known as ""the shot heard round the world"". Eight militiamen were killed and ten wounded, whereupon the remainder took flight. The British continued on to Concord and were unable to find most of the arms and ammunition of the patriots. As the British marched back toward Boston, patriot militiamen assembled along the route, taking cover behind stone walls, and sniped at the British. At Meriam's Corner in Concord, the British columns had to close in to cross a narrow bridge, exposing themselves to concentrated, deadly fire. The British retreat became a rout. It was only with the help of an additional detachment of 900 troops that the British force managed to return to Boston. This marked the beginning of the war. It was ""three days after the affair of Lexington and Concord that any movement was made towards embodying a regular army""."
"In 1777, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation, which contained a provision for raising a confederal militia that consent would be required from nine of the 13 States. Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states,"
"Some militia units appeared without adequate arms, as evidenced in this letter from John Adams to his wife, dated August 26, 1777:"
"The militia are turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland and Pennsylvania. They are distressed for want of arms. Many have none, we shall rake and scrape enough to do Howe's business, by favor of the Heaven."
"The initial enthusiasm of Patriot militiamen in the beginning days of the war soon waned. The historian Garry Wills explains,"
"The fervor of the early days in the reorganized militias wore off in the long grind of an eight-year war. Now the right to elect their own officers was used to demand that the men not serve away from their state. Men evaded service, bought substitutes to go for them as in the old days, and had to be bribed with higher and higher bounties to join the effort – which is why Jefferson and Samuel Adams called them so expensive. As wartime inflation devalued the currency, other pledges had to be offered, including land grants and the promise of ""a healthy slave"" at the end of the war. Some men would take a bounty and not show up. Or they would show up for a while, desert, and then, when they felt the need for another bounty, sign up again in a different place. ... This practice was common enough to have its own technical term – ""bounty jumping""."
"The burden of waging war passed to a large extent to the standing army, the Continental Army. The stay-at-home militia tended then to perform the important role of the internal police to keep order. British forces sought to disrupt American communities by instigating slave rebellions and Indian raids. The militia fended off these threats. Militias also spied on Loyalists in the American communities. In Albany County, New York, the militia established a Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies to look out for and investigate people with suspicious allegiances."
"Politically, the militia was highly popular during the postwar period, though to some extent, based more on pride of victory in the recent war than on the realities. This skepticism of the actual value of relying upon the militia for national defense, versus a trained regular army was expressed by Gouverneur Morris:"
"An overweening vanity leads the fond many, each man against the conviction of his own heart, to believe or affect to believe, that militia can beat veteran troops in the open field and even play of battle. This idle notion, fed by vaunting demagogues, alarmed us for our country, when in the course of that time and chance, which happen to all, she should be at war with a great power."
"The Muar Second Bridge is a 632-metre semi-harp cable-stayed bridge with a 132-metre mid-span across Muar River, similar in design to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida, in the United States, and Prai River Bridge in Penang, Malaysia. The bridge project also features a complex interchange at Parit Bunga, the first in the town."
= = = California State Water Project = = =
"The California State Water Project, commonly known as the SWP, is a state water management project in the U.S. state of California under the supervision of the California Department of Water Resources. The SWP is one of the largest public water and power utilities in the world, providing drinking water for more than 23 million people and generating an average of 6,500 GWh of hydroelectricity annually. However, as it is the largest single consumer of power in the state itself, it has a net usage of 5,100 GWh."
"The SWP collects water from rivers in Northern California and redistributes it to the water-scarce but populous south through a network of aqueducts, pumping stations and power plants. About 70% of the water provided by the project is used for urban areas and industry in Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, and 30% is used for irrigation in the Central Valley. To reach Southern California, the water must be pumped over the Tehachapi Mountains, with at the Edmonston Pumping Plant alone, the highest single water lift in the world. The SWP shares many facilities with the federal Central Valley Project (CVP), which primarily serves agricultural users. Water can be interchanged between SWP and CVP canals as needed to meet peak requirements for project constituents. The SWP provides estimated annual benefits of $400 billion to California's economy."
"Since its inception in 1960, the SWP has required the construction of 21 dams and more than of canals, pipelines and tunnels, although these constitute only a fraction of the facilities originally proposed. As a result, the project has only delivered an average of annually, as compared to total entitlements of . Environmental concerns caused by the dry-season removal of water from the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, a sensitive estuary region, have often led to further reductions in water delivery. Work continues today to expand the SWP's water delivery capacity while finding solutions for the environmental impacts of water diversion."
"The original purpose of the project was to provide water for arid Southern California, whose local water resources and share of the Colorado River were insufficient to sustain the region's growth. The SWP was rooted in two proposals. The United Western Investigation of 1951, a study by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, assessed the feasibility of interbasin water transfers in the Western United States. In California, this plan contemplated the construction of dams on rivers draining to California's North Coast – the wild and undammed Klamath, Eel, Mad and Smith River systems – and tunnels to carry the impounded water to the Sacramento River system, where it could be diverted southwards. In the same year, State Engineer A.D. Edmonston proposed the Feather River Project, which proposed the damming of the Feather River, a tributary of the Sacramento River, for the same purpose. The Feather River was much more accessible than the North Coast rivers, but did not have nearly as much water. Under both of the plans, a series of canals and pumps would carry the water south through the Central Valley to the foot of the Tehachapi Mountains, where it would pass through the Tehachapi Tunnel to reach Southern California."
"Calls for a comprehensive statewide water management system (complementing the extensive, but primarily irrigation-based Central Valley Project) led to the creation of the California Department of Water Resources in 1956. The following year, the preliminary studies were compiled into the extensive California Water Plan, or Bulletin No. 3. The project was intended for ""the control, protection, conservation, distribution, and utilization of the waters of California, to meet present and future needs for all beneficial uses and purposes in all areas of the state to the maximum feasible extent."" California governor Pat Brown would later say it was to ""correct an accident of people and geography""."
"The diversion of the North Coast rivers was abandoned in the plan's early stages after strong opposition from locals and concerns about the potential impact on the salmon in North Coast rivers. The California Water Plan would have to go ahead with the development of the Feather River alone, as proposed by Edmonston. The Burns-Porter Act of 1959 provided $1.75 billion of initial funding through a bond measure. Construction on Stage I of the project, which would deliver the first of water, began in 1960. Northern Californians opposed the measure as a boondoggle and an attempt to steal their water resources. In fact, the city of Los Angeles – which was to be one of the principal beneficiaries – also opposed the project; locals saw it as a ploy by politicians in the other Colorado River basin states to get Los Angeles to relinquish its share of the Colorado River. Historians largely attribute the success of the Burns-Porter Act and the State Water Project to major agribusiness lobbying, particularly by J.G. Boswell II of the J.G. Boswell cotton company. The bond was passed on an extremely narrow margin of 174,000 out of 5.8 million ballots cast."
"In 1961, ground was broken on Oroville Dam, and in 1963, work began on the California Aqueduct and San Luis Reservoir. The first deliveries to the Bay Area were made in 1962, and water reached the San Joaquin Valley by 1968. Due to concerns over the fault-ridden geography of the Tehachapi Mountains, the tunnel plan was scrapped; the water would have to be pumped over the mountains' crest. In 1973, the pumps and the East and West branches of the aqueduct were completed, and the first water was delivered to Southern California. A Peripheral Canal, which would have carried SWP water around the vulnerable and ecologically sensitive Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta, was rejected in 1982 due to environmental concerns. The Coastal Branch, which delivers water to coastal central California, was completed in 1997."
"The Feather River, a tributary of the Sacramento River, provides the primary watershed for the State Water Project. Runoff from the Feather River headwaters is captured in Antelope, Frenchman, and Davis reservoirs, which impound tributaries of the North and Middle forks of the Feather River. Collectively referred to as the Upper Feather River Lakes, these three reservoirs provide a combined storage capacity of about ."
"Water released from the Upper Feather River system flows into Lake Oroville, which is formed by the Oroville Dam several miles above the city of Oroville. At , Oroville is the tallest dam in the United States; by volume it is the largest dam in California. Authorized by an emergency flood control measure in 1957, Oroville Dam was built between 1961 and 1967 with the reservoir filling for the first time in 1968."
"Lake Oroville has a capacity to store approximately of water which accounts for 61 percent of the SWP's total system storage capacity, and is the single most important reservoir of the project."
"Water stored in Lake Oroville is released through the 819 MW Edward Hyatt pumped-storage powerplant and two other hydroelectric plants downstream of Oroville Dam, which together make up the Oroville-Thermalito Complex. The Thermalito Forebay and Afterbay support the 120 MW Thermalito Pumping-Generating Plant, and the Thermalito Diversion Dam supports a smaller 3.3 MW powerplant. The entire system generates approximately 2.2 billion kilowatt hours per year, making up about a third of the total power generated by SWP facilities."
"From Oroville, a regulated water flow travels down the Feather and Sacramento Rivers to the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta. North of Rio Vista, about per year is pumped into the North Bay Aqueduct, completed in 1988. The aqueduct delivers water to clients in Napa and Solano counties."
"The vast majority of the SWP water is drawn through the Delta's complex estuary system into the Clifton Court Forebay, located northwest of Tracy on the southern end of the Delta. Here, the Harvey O. Banks Pumping Plant lifts water into the California Aqueduct. Completed in 1963, the eleven pump units can lift up to of water – upgraded in 1986 from its original capacity of across seven units."
"From here the water flows briefly south along the California Aqueduct to the Bethany Reservoir. The South Bay Pumping Plant supplies the South Bay Aqueduct, which has delivered water west to Alameda County since 1962 and Santa Clara County since 1965. The aqueduct carries a maximum of per year. Up to of this water can be stored in Lake Del Valle, an offstream reservoir located near Livermore."
"South of the Bay Area diversions, the bulk of the SWP water – ranging from per year – travels south along the western flank of the San Joaquin Valley through the California Aqueduct. The main section of the aqueduct stretches for ; it is composed mainly of concrete-lined canals but also includes of tunnels, of pipelines and of siphons. The aqueduct reaches a maximum width of and a maximum depth of ; some parts of the channel are capable of delivering more than . The section of the aqueduct that runs through the San Joaquin Valley includes multiple turnouts where water is released to irrigate roughly of land on the west side of the valley."
"The aqueduct enters the O'Neill Forebay reservoir west of Volta, where water can be pumped into a giant offstream storage facility, San Luis Reservoir, formed by the nearby B.F. Sisk Dam. San Luis Reservoir is shared by the SWP and the federal Central Valley Project; here water can be switched between the California Aqueduct and Delta-Mendota Canal to cope with fluctuating demands. The SWP has a 50 percent share of the of storage available in San Luis Reservoir."
"South of the San Luis Reservoir complex, the aqueduct steadily gains elevation through a series of massive pumping plants. Dos Amigos Pumping Plant is located shortly south of San Luis, lifting the water . Near Kettleman City, the Coastal Branch splits off from the main California Aqueduct. Buena Vista, Teerink and Chrisman Pumping Plants are located on the main aqueduct near the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley near Bakersfield. The aqueduct then reaches A.D. Edmonston Pumping Plant, which lifts the water over the Tehachapi Mountains that separate the San Joaquin Valley from Southern California. It is the highest pump-lift in the SWP, with a capacity of across fourteen units. Initial construction of Edmonston was completed in 1974, with the last three units installed in the 1980s."
"Once reaching the crest of the Tehachapis, the aqueduct runs through a series of tunnels to the Tehachapi Afterbay, where its flow is partitioned between West and East Branches."
"The Coastal Branch diverts about per year from the California Aqueduct to parts of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. The aqueduct stretches for , and is mostly made up of buried pipeline. Pumping plants at Las Perillas, Badger Hill, Devil's Den, Bluestone, and Polonio Pass serve to lift the water over the California Coast Ranges. Once over the crest of the mountains, the water is reregulated in a series of small reservoirs numbered Tanks 1 through 5. The Coastal Branch was completed in 1994 following a severe drought that led to calls for importation of SWP water."
"Through a pipeline known as the Central Coast Water Authority extension, completed in 1997, the Coastal Branch supplies water to Lake Cachuma, a reservoir on the Santa Ynez River."
"From the terminus of the main California Aqueduct at Tehachapi Afterbay, the West Branch carries water to a second reservoir, Quail Lake, via the Oso Pumping Plant. The water then runs south by gravity to the 78 MW William E. Warne Powerplant, located on the Pyramid Lake reservoir. The West Branch delivered about per year for the period 1995–2010."
"From Pyramid Lake, water is released through the Angeles Tunnel to the Castaic Power Plant on Elderberry Forebay and the Castaic Lake reservoir located north of Santa Clarita. Castaic Power Plant is a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant capable of producing 1,247 MW on peak demand. Together, Pyramid and Castaic Lakes form the primary storage for West Branch water delivered to Southern California. Water is supplied to municipalities in Los Angeles and Ventura counties."
"The East Branch takes water from Tehachapi Afterbay along the north side of the San Gabriel Mountains and San Bernardino Mountains to the Silverwood Lake reservoir, which can hold . From here it passes through a tunnel under the San Bernardino Mountains to the Devil Canyon Powerplant, the largest ""recovery plant"", or aqueduct power plant, of the SWP system. The water then flows through the Santa Ana Tunnel to Lake Perris, which can store up to ."
"Water deliveries through the East Branch averaged per year from 1995 through 2012. The East Branch principally provides water for cities and farms in the Inland Empire, Orange County, and other areas south of Los Angeles. Through Lake Perris, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California receives a large portion of its water from the SWP. Water is also supplied to the San Diego Aqueduct through a connection from Perris to Lake Skinner, further south."
"The original 1957 California Water Plan included provisions for dams on the Klamath, Eel, Mad and Smith Rivers of California's North Coast. Fed by prolific rainfall in the western Coast Ranges and Klamath Mountains, these rivers discharge more than to the Pacific each year, more than that of the entire Sacramento River system. The plan was basically a variation of a contemporary Bureau of Reclamation project, the Klamath Diversion."
"A series of dams in these watersheds would shunt water through interbasin transfers into the Klamath River system. The centerpiece of the project would be a reservoir on the Klamath River – the largest man-made lake in California – from where the water would flow through the Trinity Tunnel into the Sacramento River, and thence to the canals and pump systems of the SWP. This would have provided between of water each year for the SWP. The diversion of the North Coast rivers, however were dropped from the initial SWP program."
"In the mid-1960s, devastating flooding brought renewed interest in damming the North Coast rivers. The Department of Water Resources formed the State-Federal Interagency Task Force with the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers to develop plans for developing the rivers in the name of flood control – which would, incidentally, provide a way to divert some of their water into the SWP system. Although most of the proposed projects met their demise over political squabbles, one that persisted was the Dos Rios Project on the Eel River system, which would have involved constructing a gigantic dam on the Middle Fork of the Eel River, diverting water through the Grindstone Tunnel into the Sacramento Valley. Supporters of this project cited the disastrous Christmas flood of 1964 and the flood control benefits Dos Rios would provide to the Eel River basin."
"The Klamath and Dos Rios diversions were heavily opposed by local towns and Native American tribes, whose land would have been flooded under the reservoirs. Fishermen expressed concerns over the impact of the dams on the salmon runs of North Coast rivers, especially the Klamath – the largest Pacific coast salmon river south of the Columbia River. The project would have eliminated 98 percent of the salmon spawning grounds on the Klamath. California Governor Ronald Reagan refused to approve the Dos Rios project, citing economic insensibility and fraudulent claims made by project proponents. The flood control benefits, for example, were largely exaggerated; the Dos Rios dam would have reduced the record Eel River flood crest of 1964 by only had it been in place."
The Old English Bulldog is an extinct breed of dog.
"The Old English Bulldog was compact, broad and muscular, as reflected in the well-known depiction ""Crib and Rosa"". Through John Scott's engraving, this painting became the best-known and most reproduced painting of dogs from that period. As described in the Philo-kuon standard from 1865, the average height was approximately , and they weighed about . A particular characteristic of the breed was the lower jaw that projected considerably in front of the upper jaw, which made possible a strong, vise-like grip."
"The English blood sport of bull-baiting allowed for a specialized breed in the form of the Old English Bulldog.The main locations in London for these exhibitions were the Westminster Pit, Beargarden and Old Conduit Fields. One of the breeders who spanned the transition period between the Old English Bulldog and the modern Bulldog was famous dog dealer Bill George."
"Historians are fairly confident that the Old English Bulldog is derived from ancient war dogs, such as the old Mastiff or the extinct Alaunt dog. Others believe that the true origin of the breed is not entirely clear. Depictions in old prints show that the variety was without doubt a small Mastiff with a comparatively long head. The word 'Mastiff' was eventually dropped when describing these smaller Mastiffs, as the Mastiff proper was found too slow for bull-baiting."
"Eventually, the Greyhound was crossed into the breed, increasing the Mastiff's speed without losing the breed's ferocity. This step reduced the Old English Bulldog's size and weight, with the Greyhound's features seen in specimens of that time."
"Two other recognized members of the breed can be seen in the 1817 painting ""Crib and Rosa"", with Rosa exemplifying the form and size of the ideal type of Old English Bulldog, albeit deficient in wrinkles about the head and neck and in substance of bone in the limbs. They are faster than regular bulldogs and have an average speed of ."
"Many authors bring us descriptions about the extinct bulldog, but a description stands out as one of the most extensive by William Hamilton Maxwell:"
"In England, the passage of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 caused a decline of bull-baiting and dog fighting, leading to a lack of interest in perpetuating the Old English Bulldog. Three dogs from the Duke of Hamilton's strain of Old English Bulldog, Wasp, Child, and Billy, were depicted in a painting and recognized as some of the last known members of the breed before they became extinct."
"Despite the laws making dog fighting illegal, the activity continued for many years. Breeders determined a cross between the Old English Bulldog and Old English Terrier created a superior fighting dog with increased quickness and dexterity. This new breed of dog, called the Bull and Terrier, was a precursor to the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, English Bull Terrier and American Pit Bull Terrier and accelerated the extinction of the Old English Bulldog."
"Several breeders are attempting to recreate this extinct breed, using known descendants of the Old English Bulldog lineage, with some success. As the breed went extinct long before DNA was recognized and little genetic material has survived, it is unclear how much the modern reincarnations of the breed resemble the original Old English Bulldog, and most of the recreations have purposely introduced differences in the breed compared to the original, most prominently reducing the breed's violent nature."
"One contemporary recreation of the breed started in the 1970s, using a breeding program developed for cattle at The Ohio State University. The lineage has since split into two, known as the Olde English Bulldogge and the Leavitt Bulldog, the Leavitt Bulldog being a lighter, more athletic dog. These modern day versions, though possessing similar physical abilities, do not have the violent temperament of the Old English Bulldog. The line-breeding was done with a foundation of half Bulldog, and the other half Bullmastiff and American Bulldog and American Pit Bull Terrier."
"There are several other recreations, including the Able Bulldog, Continental bulldog, Dorset Old Tyme Bulldogge, Olde English Bulldogge, Renascence Bulldogge, Victorian Bulldog and Wilkinson Bulldog."
"Often confused with the Old English Bulldog, the Bulldog is noted for its sweet disposition; however, it has maintained little of the speed and agility that were the definitive characteristics of the Old English Bulldog."
"= = = Battle of Gettysburg, second day = = ="
"During the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg (July 2, 1863) Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee attempted to capitalize on his first day's success. His Army of Northern Virginia launched multiple attacks on the flanks of the Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade. The assaults were unsuccessful, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides."
"After a short delay to assemble his forces and avoid detection in his approach march, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet attacked with his First Corps against the Union left flank. His division under Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood attacked Little Round Top and Devil's Den. To Hood's left, Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws attacked the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard. Although neither prevailed, the Union III Corps was effectively destroyed as a combat organization as it attempted to defend a salient over too wide a front. Gen. Meade rushed as many as 20,000 reinforcements from elsewhere in his line to resist these fierce assaults. The attacks in this sector concluded with an unsuccessful assault by the Confederate Third Corps division of Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson against the Union center on Cemetery Ridge."
"That evening, Confederate Second Corps commander Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell turned demonstrations against the Union right flank into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and East Cemetery Hill, but both were repulsed."
"The Union army had occupied strong defensive positions, and Meade handled his forces well, resulting in heavy losses for both sides, but leaving the disposition of forces on both sides essentially unchanged. Lee's hope of crushing the Army of the Potomac on Northern territory was dashed, but undaunted, he began to plan for the third day of fighting."
"This article includes details of many attacks on the Union left flank (Devil's Den, the Wheatfield, and the Peach Orchard) and center (Cemetery Ridge), but separate articles describe other major engagements in this massive battle of the second day:"
"By the morning of July 2, six of the seven corps of the Army of the Potomac had arrived on the battlefield. The I Corps (Maj. Gen. John Newton, replacing Abner Doubleday) and the XI Corps (Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard) had fought hard on the first day, and they were joined that evening by the yet-unengaged troops of the XII Corps (Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum), III Corps (Maj. Gen. Daniel E. Sickles), and II Corps (Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock), and on the morning of July 2 by the V Corps (Maj. Gen. George Sykes). The VI Corps (Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick) was still 30 miles (50 km) away in Manchester, Maryland, on that morning. They assumed positions in a fish hook shape about three miles (5 km ) long, from Culp's Hill, around to Cemetery Hill, and down the spine of Cemetery Ridge. The Army of Northern Virginia line was roughly parallel to the Union's, on Seminary Ridge and on an arc northwest, north, and northeast of the town of Gettysburg. All of the Second Corps (Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell) and Third Corps (Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill) were present, and the First Corps (Lt. Gen. James Longstreet) was arriving from Cashtown; only Longstreet's division under George E. Pickett did not participate in the battle on July 2."
"Robert E. Lee had several choices to consider for his next move. His order of the previous evening that Ewell occupy Culp's Hill or Cemetery Hill ""if practicable"" was not realized, and the Union army was now in strong defensive positions with compact interior lines. His senior subordinate, Longstreet, counseled a strategic move—the Army should leave its current position, swing around the Union left flank, and interpose itself on Meade's lines of communication, inviting an attack by Meade that could be received on advantageous ground. Longstreet argued that this was the entire point of the Gettysburg campaign, to move strategically into enemy territory but fight only defensive battles there. Lee rejected this argument because he was concerned about the morale of his soldiers having to give up the ground for which they fought so hard the day before. He wanted to retain the initiative and had a high degree of confidence in the ability of his army to succeed in any endeavor, an opinion bolstered by their spectacular victories the previous day and at Chancellorsville. He was therefore determined to attack on July 2."
"Lee wanted to seize the high ground south of Gettysburg, primarily Cemetery Hill, which dominated the town, the Union supply lines, and the road to Washington, D.C., and he believed an attack up the Emmitsburg Road would be the best approach. He desired an early-morning assault by Longstreet's Corps, reinforced by Ewell, who would move his Corps from its current location north of town to join Longstreet. Ewell protested this arrangement, claiming his men would be demoralized if forced to move from the ground they had captured. And Longstreet protested that his division commanded by John Bell Hood had not arrived completely (and that Pickett's division had not arrived at all). Lee compromised with his subordinates. Ewell would remain in place and conduct a demonstration (a minor diversionary attack) against Culp's Hill, pinning down the right flank of the Union defenders so that they could not reinforce their left, where Longstreet would launch the primary attack as soon as he was ready. Ewell's demonstration would be turned into a full-scale assault if the opportunity presented itself."
"Lee ordered Longstreet to launch a surprise attack with two divisions straddling, and guiding on, the Emmitsburg Road. Hood's division would move up the eastern side of the road, Lafayette McLaws's the western side, each perpendicular to it. The objective was to strike the Union Army in an oblique attack, rolling up their left flank, collapsing the line of Union corps onto each other, and seizing Cemetery Hill. The Third Corps division of Richard H. Anderson would join the attack against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge at the appropriate time. This plan was based on faulty intelligence because of the absence of J.E.B. Stuart and his cavalry, leaving Lee with an incomplete understanding of the position of his enemy. He believed that the left flank of the Union army was adjacent to the Emmitsburg Road hanging ""in the air"" (unsupported by any natural barrier), and an early morning scouting expedition seemed to confirm that. In reality, by dawn of July 2 the Union line stretched the length of Cemetery Ridge and anchored at the foot of the imposing Little Round Top. Lee's plan was doomed from its conception, as Meade's line occupied only a small portion of the Emmitsburg Road near the town itself. Any force attacking up the road would find two entire Union corps and their guns posted on the ridge to their immediate right flank. By midday, however, Union general Sickles would change all that."
"When Sickles arrived with his III Corps, General Meade instructed him to take up a position on Cemetery Ridge that linked up with the II Corps on his right and anchored his left on Little Round Top. Sickles originally did so, but after noon he became concerned about a slightly higher piece of ground 0.7 miles (1,100 m) to his front, a peach orchard owned by the Sherfy family. He undoubtedly recalled the debacle at Chancellorsville, where the high ground (""Hazel Grove"") he was forced to give up was used against him as a deadly Confederate artillery platform. Acting without authorization from Meade, Sickles marched his corps to occupy the peach orchard. This had two significant negative consequences: his position now took the form of a salient, which could be attacked from multiple sides; and he was forced to occupy lines that were much longer than his two-division corps could defend. Meade was furious about this insubordination, but it was too late to do anything about it—the Confederate attack was imminent."
"Longstreet's attack was delayed, however, because he first had to wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, circuitous route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were astonished to find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order."
"Even so, and partly because of Sickles's unexpected location, Longstreet's assault did not proceed according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push on either side of the Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an ""en echelon"" style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast."
"Longstreet's attack commenced with a 30-minute artillery barrage by 36 guns that was particularly punishing to the Union infantry in the Peach Orchard and the troops and batteries on Houck's Ridge. Maj. Gen. John Bell Hood's division deployed in Biesecker's Woods on Warfield Ridge (the southern extension of Seminary Ridge) in two lines of two brigades each: at the left front, Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade (Hood's old unit); right front, Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law; left rear, Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson; right rear, Brig. Gen. Henry L. Benning."
"At 4:30 p.m., Hood stood in his stirrups at the front of the Texas Brigade and shouted, ""Fix bayonets, my brave Texans! Forward and take those heights!"" It is unclear to which heights he was referring. His orders were to cross the Emmitsburg Road and wheel left, moving north with his left flank guiding on the road. This discrepancy became a serious problem when, minutes later on Slyder's Lane, Hood was felled by an artillery shell bursting overhead, severely wounding his left arm and putting him out of action. His division moved ahead to the east, no longer under central control."
"There were four probable reasons for the deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank if they were not dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and drawing his brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control."
"Some common sources of toxins that pets encounter include some plants, human medications and cosmetics, cleaning products, and even some foods."
Some foods consumed safely by humans are harmful to dogs:
"Cocoa within chocolate contains theobromine, a chemical stimulant that, together with caffeine and theophylline, belongs to the group of methylxanthine alkaloids. Dogs are unable to metabolize theobromine effectively. If they eat chocolate, the theobromine can remain in their bloodstreams for days, and dogs may experience fast heart rate, severe diarrhea, epileptic seizures, heart attacks, internal bleeding, and eventually death. One ounce (oz) of milk chocolate contains 44 - 55 milligrams (mg) of theobromine, and baker's chocolate contains 393 mg of theobromine. The lethal dose for 50% of dogs (LD50) is 100 - 200 mg per kilogram (kg) of body weight, yet some dogs will exhibit signs of toxicosis after ingesting as little as 20 mg per kg. In case of accidental intake of chocolate, especially involving a smaller dog, contact a veterinarian or animal poison control immediately; it is commonly recommended to induce vomiting within two hours of ingestion. Treatment protocol also includes intravenous fluid therapy and/or administration of activated charcoal. Large breeds are less susceptible to chocolate poisoning, but can still die after eating four ounces of chocolate."
Carob treats are often available as dog treats; these are unrelated to chocolate and are safe.
"Grapes and raisins can cause acute kidney failure in dogs (see also grape and raisin toxicity in dogs). The exact mechanism is unknown, nor is there any means to determine the susceptibility of an individual dog. While as little as one raisin can be toxic to a susceptible dog, some other dogs have eaten as much as a pound of grapes or raisins at a time without ill effects. The affected dog usually vomits a few hours after consumption and begins showing signs of kidney failure three to five days later. A mycotoxin is suspected to be involved, but one has not been found in grapes or raisins ingested by affected dogs. The reason some dogs develop kidney failure following ingestion of grapes and raisins is not known. The most common pathological finding is proximal renal tubular necrosis."
"Onions cause hemolytic anemia in dogs (and cats). Allyl propyl disulfide has been reported as being considered to be the main cause of onion poisoning in dogs. Thiosulfate has also been implicated. Thiosulfate levels are not affected by cooking or processing. Occasional exposure to small amounts is usually not a problem, but continuous exposure to even small amounts can be a serious threat. Also garlic contains thiosulfate, even if to a significantly lesser extent, and it is also known to cause diarrhea and vomiting. Other signs of toxicosis include pale gums and intravascular hemolysis."
"Nutmeg is highly neurotoxic to dogs and causes seizures, tremors, and nervous system disorders which can be fatal. Nutmeg's rich, spicy scent is attractive to dogs which can result in a dog ingesting a lethal amount of this spice. Eggnog and other food preparations which contain nutmeg should not be given to dogs."
"Macadamia nuts can cause non-fatal stiffness, tremors, hyperthermia, and abdominal pain. The exact mechanism is not known. Most dogs recover with supportive care when the source of exposure is removed."
"Hops, a plant used in making beer, can cause malignant hyperthermia in dogs, usually with fatal results. Certain breeds, such as Greyhounds, seem particularly sensitive to hop toxicity, but hops should be kept away from all dogs. Even small amounts of hops can trigger a potentially deadly reaction, even if the hops are ""spent"" after use in brewing."
"Ingestion of yeast, for example in uncooked bread dough, can cause intestinal obstruction. The yeast can also cause fermentation internally, resulting in ethanol (alcohol) poisoning."
"Xylitol is a sugar substitute used in chewing gum, chewable vitamins, candy, toothpaste, and other products. Although a small preliminary study indicated xylitol may be safe for dogs, other studies show significant toxicity. There have been cases of foods, candies and gums containing xylitol causing toxic or even fatal liver damage in dogs. Ingestion may cause hypoglycemia."
Some common household chemicals are particularly dangerous to dogs:
"Poisoning with pain medications is common. Aspirin, paracetamol/acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve) can all cause severe clinical signs in dogs, including vomiting blood, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Specifically, aspirin can cause metabolic acidosis and bleeding disorders, acetaminophen can cause liver disease at high doses (the toxic dose is 150 mg per kilogram of body weight), ibuprofen can cause kidney disease, and naproxen can cause ulcers in the stomach, which can perforate. Treatment depends on the clinical signs and often involves inducing vomiting, gastric lavage, intravenous fluid diuresis, and supportive care. The antidote for acetaminophen toxicity is N-acetylcysteine."
"Most diseases that affect dogs or humans are not transferable between the two species. Diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans are termed zoonoses. A well-known zoonosis is rabies, a viral infection transmitted through a bite. A common bacterial zoonosis is leptospirosis, transmitted through urine. Some of the most important zoonoses are parasitic. Zoonotic intestinal parasites transmitted through contact with feces include ""Toxocara canis"" (the canine roundworm), which causes toxocariasis, visceral larva migrans, and ocular larva migrans, and hookworms, which can cause cutaneous larva migrans. Zoonotic skin parasites include scabies, caused by the mite ""Sarcoptes scabiei"". The most common zoonotic fungal disease is ringworm, caused in this case by ""Microsporum canis""."
"Vaccinations are an important preventive animal health measure. The specific vaccinations recommended for dogs varies depending on geographic location, environment, travel history, and the activities the animal frequently engages in. In the United States, regardless of any of these factors, it is usually highly recommended that dogs be vaccinated against rabies, ""canine parvovirus"", canine distemper, and infectious canine hepatitis (using ""canine adenovirus type 2"" to avoid reaction). The decision on whether to vaccinate against other diseases, including leptospirosis, Lyme disease, ""Bordetella bronchiseptica"", ""parainfluenza virus"", and ""canine coronavirus"", should be made between an owner and a veterinarian, taking into account factors specific to the dog."
"Dental disease is one of the most common diseases in dogs. Accumulation of plaque and subsequently tartar leads to gingivitis and then periodontitis (gum disease). Periodontitis leads to loss of the bony attachment of the teeth and tooth loss. Preventive measures include tooth brushing, providing an appropriate diet (avoiding tinned and other soft foods and providing dental chew treats) and dental scaling and polishing. Cavities are uncommon in dogs."
Once-a-month topical products and oral medications are the most commonly used products to kill and prevent heartworm infection and flea or tick infestations.
"Feeding table scraps to a dog is generally not recommended, at least in excess. Just as in humans, a dog's diet must consist of the appropriate mix of nutrients, carbohydrates, and proteins in order to give them the minerals and vitamins that they need. Dogs get ample correct nutrition from their natural, normal diet; wild and feral dogs can usually get all the nutrients needed from a diet of whole prey and raw meat. In addition, a human diet is not ideal for a dog: the concept of a ""balanced"" diet for a facultative carnivore like a dog is not the same as in an omnivorous human. Dogs will usually eat all the scraps and treats they are fed: usually too much food. While not all human delicacies are acutely toxic to dogs (see above), many have the same chronically unfortunate results as they do for humans."
"Obesity is an increasingly common problem in dogs in Western countries. As with humans, obesity can cause numerous health problems in dogs (although dogs are much less susceptible to the common cardiac and arterial consequences of obesity than humans are). According to a study published in the ""Journal of Veterinary Internal Medicine"", the prevalence of obesity in dogs is between 22 and 40 percent."
"Obesity may also be caused by some diseases, such as Cushing's disease or hypothyroidism."
"Dog treats are often given to pets as a reward or just to let them chew on a bone, which works their jaw muscles and helps keep their teeth clean. Although dog treats carry high benefits for dogs' teeth, they can also be a source of problems like obesity when given excessively, especially human table scraps."
"The type of food given has a direct bearing on the tendency of a dog to become overweight. Table scraps, treats, and even premium high-energy dog foods can contribute to obesity. Therefore, it is highly important to closely monitor the quantity of treats that a dog gets especially when the dog's activity is diminished. Dog treats are more likely to be linked to obesity in old dogs, since in their old age they are less likely to be active and exercising. Active dogs require and use more calories."
"Some dogs may attempt to consume feces. Some consume their own or other dogs' feces; others seem to prefer cat feces (which, due to the feline digestive system, are high in protein and consumed by many animals in the wild.) This can be harmful if the feces has any pathogens or parasites or contain excreted drugs."
"It is not yet clear whether or not vitamins and supplements should be administered in dogs—opinions among veterinarians vary widely. While some think that vitamins and supplements are necessary and can improve the health of a dog, others believe that they are unnecessary and may harm the dog. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), dogs receive a complete and balanced diet from the commercially processed dog food alone. Pet owners who give their dogs homemade diets may incorporate extra vitamins and supplements."
Between approximately 10 and 30 percent of dogs in the United States receive nutritional supplements. A survey of U.S. pet owners in 2006 found that the most commonly used supplements were multivitamins and chondroprotective agents.
"Overdoses of vitamins can be harmful in dogs. As an example, calcium in excess can cause bone problems, especially in the large-breed dogs. Over-supplementation of vitamins A and D can cause vitamin toxicity in dogs. Excess vitamin A can cause dehydration, joint pain and can also harm the blood vessels, while too much vitamin D can cause muscular atrophy, or loss of appetite."
"Spaying (females) and neutering (males) refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Neutering has also been known to reduce aggression in male dogs, but has been shown to occasionally increase aggression in female dogs."
Animal control agencies in the United States and the ASPCA advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be spayed or neutered so that they do not have undesired puppies.
"Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, puppies born to strays or as the result of accidental breedings often end up being killed in animal shelters. Spaying and neutering can also decrease the risk of hormone-driven diseases such as mammary cancer, as well as undesired hormone-driven behaviors. However, certain medical problems are more likely after surgery, such as urinary incontinence in females and prostate cancer in males. The hormonal changes involved with sterilization are likely to somewhat change the animal's personality, however, and some object to spaying and neutering as the sterilization could be carried out without the excision of organs."
"It is not essential for a female dog to either experience a heat cycle or have puppies before spaying, and likewise, a male dog does not need the experience of mating before neutering."
"Female cats and dogs are seven times more likely to develop mammary tumors if they are not spayed before their first heat cycle. The high dietary estrogen content of the average commercial pet food may be contributing factors in the development of mammary cancer, especially when these exogenous sources are added to those normal estrogens produced by the body. Dog food containing soybeans or soybean fractions have been found to contain phytoestrogens in levels that could have biological effects when ingested longterm."
"Kenta's first major rivalry in singles competition began in March 2005 following a dispute with SUWA, which led to a series of confrontations between the two, including a violent match that ended in his opponent getting disqualified for assaulting the referee. This led to Kenta getting one more chance to challenge for the Junior Heavyweight title against Yoshinobu Kanemaru at Destiny on July 18, which saw him win the title. He made his first defense two months later against Suwa, then against Kotaro Suzuki as his alter ego, Mushiking Terry. Simultaneously, Kenta began teaming with Katsuyori Shibata as The Takeover, challenging for the GHC Tag Team Championship, the heavyweight version of the company's tag team title."
"On March 5, 2006, Kenta faced a major challenge in Kenta Kobashi, which saw him lose following a ""Burning Hammer"". This was followed by a loss of the Junior Heavyweight title on June 4 to Takashi Sugiura. This saw Kenta shift his attention to the GHC Heavyweight Championship, challenging Naomichi Marufuji, losing in a match which won numerous awards and accolades from the wrestling media."
"Kenta spent the majority of his 2007 time in Noah wrestling a variety of tag team and six-man tag team matches with protégé Taiji Ishimori and Akitoshi Saito as partners. He saw most of his success with Ishimori as the two had critically acclaimed matches against a wide variety of competitors, including Ring of Honor (ROH) competitors on loan to the company due to the talent exchange agreement, the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA), between ROH and Noah: the Briscoe Brothers, Davey Richards, and Bryan Danielson. As Kenta and Ishimori progressed as a unit, they entered the first NTV Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Tournament; in the finals they beat Marufuji and Kota Ibushi to win the tournament. They later challenged the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Champions, Dragon Gate wrestlers BxB Hulk and Shingo Takagi, in a winning effort before losing them to Yoshinobu Kanemaru and Kotaro Suzuki, only to defeat the team to win the second NTV Junior Heavyweight Tag Team League Tournament."
"Following his loss of the tag title, Kenta returned to competing in singles competition by defeating Bryan Danielson for his second GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship, which led to a match with Marufuji, who had won the World Junior Heavyweight Championship, to attempt to unify the titles; the match ended in a sixty-minute draw, keeping the titles in the hands of their respective holder, while gaining favorable reviews for their efforts by the media with some claiming it to be a ""Match of the Year"". Kenta lost the title in February 2009 to rival in their interpromotional rivalry with another member of the GPWA in the Kensuke Office, Katsuhiko Nakajima, only to win it back in the next month. In October, Kobayashi was forced to vacate the title after suffering a knee injury, which would keep him sidelined for over seven months."
"Kobayashi made his return from injury on June 6, 2010, losing to Naomichi Marufuji in a GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship number one contender's match. On October 30, 2010, Kenta and Atsushi Aoki defeated Roderick Strong and Eddie Edwards in the finals of a tournament to win the 2010 Nippon TV Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League. As a result, Kenta and Aoki received a shot at the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, but were defeated by the champions, New Japan Pro Wrestling representatives Koji Kanemoto and Tiger Mask, on November 23, 2010. On January 29, 2011, Kenta turned heel and join the Disobey stable with members Muhammad Yone, Yoshinobu Kanemaru and Genba Hirayanagi. Kenta would change his look and attitude. Then on March 5, he turned on Yone, removing him from the group. One week later, he renamed the stable No Mercy. On May 25 Kenta and Yoshinobu Kanemaru defeated Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki of the ANMU stable to win the vacant GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship. After months of trying to persuade his mentor Yoshihiro Takayama to join No Mercy, on June 26 Takayama turned on his partner Takuma Sano during a tag match against Kenta and Kanemaru and became the fourth member of the group. Kenta and Kanemaru would then make it to the finals of the Junior Tag League on July 30. They lost to Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki. Then on August 18, 2011 Kenta and Yoshihiro Takayama won the Noah 2 Day Tag Team Tournament. On August 24, Kenta and Kanemaru successfully defended their tag title against Aoki and Suzuki, who got the shot due to their victory in the Junior Tag League. On September 23, Kenta confronted GHC Heavyweight Champion Go Shiozaki after he defeated Takayama to retain the title. Kenta got a number one contender's match with Takashi Sugiura, which he won on October 10. Kenta and Kanemaru lost the GHC Junior Heavyweight tag title to Aoki and Suzuki on October 16."
"At Noah's Halloween show on October 31, 2011, Kenta challenged the NJPW team Bad Intentions (Giant Bernard and Karl Anderson) for the GHC Heavyweight Tag Team Championship with Yoshihiro Takayama. The match was set for 2012, but never happened due to injury. In November, Kenta entered Noah's Global Tag League and developed a new submission move he called ""Game Over"" to help him dispatch heavyweights. Kenta would make it to the finals on November 20, but would lose to Takeshi Morishima. On November 27, he lost to Go Shiozaki in his GHC Heavyweight title shot. In December 2011, Kenta tore his ACL again, forcing him to undergo another surgery to repair it. It was announced that he would be out of action for six to seven months. Tokyo Sports named Kenta the 2011 Technical Wrestler of the Year. Despite his injury, Kenta would stay in Noah and manage No Mercy during his injury. On February 14, 2012, Kenta recruited Shuhei Taniguchi as the fifth member of No Mercy and change his name to Maybach, becoming his mouthpiece and talking for him."
"Kenta made his in-ring return on July 22, 2012, losing to Naomichi Marufuji. On October 8, Kenta and Maybach Taniguchi defeated Magnus and Samoa Joe to win the GHC Tag Team Championship for the first time. However, they lost the title to Akitoshi Saito and Go Shiozaki just eighteen days later. On November 23, Kenta won the 2012 Global League."
"On January 27, 2013, Kenta defeated Takeshi Morishima for the GHC Heavyweight Championship at Great Voyage 2013. On February 9, Maybach Taniguchi turned on Kenta and stole his Heavyweight Championship belt. The following week, Kenta took part in a South American tour with the Alianza Latinoamericana de Lucha Libre (AULL) promotion, during which he won the Torneo Latino Americano de Lucha Libre, defeating Super Crazy in the finals. On March 10, Kenta defeated Maybach Taniguchi for his first successful defense of the GHC Heavyweight Championship. On April 28, Kenta and Yoshihiro Takayama defeated Katsuhiko Nakajima and Kensuke Sasaki in the finals to win the 2013 Global Tag League. On May 11, Kenta took part in Kenta Kobashi's retirement match at Final Burning in Budokan, where he, Go Shiozaki, Maybach Taniguchi, and Yoshinobu Kanemaru were defeated by Kobashi, Jun Akiyama, Keiji Mutoh, and Kensuke Sasaki. The following day, Kenta made his second successful defense of the GHC Heavyweight Championship against Takashi Sugiura. On June 2, Kenta defeated New Japan Pro Wrestling representative and reigning GHC Tag Team Champion Toru Yano for his third successful title defense. Six days later, Kenta was pinned by Yano in a GHC Tag Team Championship match, where he and Yoshihiro Takayama unsuccessfully challenged Yano and Takashi Iizuka. On July 7, Kenta made his fourth successful defense of the GHC Heavyweight Championship against Naomichi Marufuji. Kenta's fifth successful title defense took place on August 4, when he defeated Muhammad Yone. Next Kenta defended his title against the reigning GHC Tag Team Champions, first defeating Shane Haste on September 7 and then Mikey Nicholls on September 16. On October 5, Kenta defeated Diamond Ring representative Katsuhiko Nakajima for his eighth successful title defense. With the win, Kenta became the first wrestler to successfully defend the GHC Heavyweight Championship eight times during a calendar year. On December 7, Kenta defeated New Japan representative and winner of the 2013 Global League, Yuji Nagata, for his ninth successful title defense. Kenta's near one-year long reign ended on January 5, 2014, when he lost the title to Takeshi Morishima in his tenth defense."
"On February 3, 2014, Kenta and Maybach Taniguchi's long rivalry culminated in a No Disqualification match, where Kenta was victorious. After Yuji Nagata had defeated Morishima to become the GHC Heavyweight Champion, Kenta received the first shot at the new champion, but was defeated in the title match on February 22. On April 30, Noah held a press conference during which Kenta announced his resignation from the promotion. Kenta wrestled his farewell match on May 17, where he and Naomichi Marufuji defeated Katsuhiko Nakajima and Takashi Sugiura."
"While still under WWE contract, Kenta made a one-off return to Noah under his WWE ring name of Hideo Itami on September 1, 2018, losing to Naomichi Marufuji at Marufuji's 20th Anniversary show."
"Aside from competing in Pro Wrestling Noah, Kenta has been able to compete abroad in the United States with other participating members of the GPWA. His first appearance in the country was with Ring of Honor at Final Battle 2005, as a fan favorite, defending the GHC Junior Heavyweight title against Low Ki. He returned to the company the following year for Best in the World in New York City on March 25 where he and Naomichi Marufuji defeated the team of Samoa Joe and ROH World champion Bryan Danielson after Kenta connected with his finishing strike, the Go 2 Sleep, on Danielson. Kenta returned for ""In Your Face"" featuring him in a three-way match against Joe and Danielson, which ended in similar fashion."
"Kenta's first loss in the company came in the form of a tag team match, which saw his partner, Davey Richards, get pinned in a match against the Briscoe Brothers. This led to a series of matches with the two against each other, as well as reluctant partners. At ""Glory by Honor V: Night 2"" Kenta received another match against Danielson for the ROH World title, which saw him submit to Danielson's signature hold, the Cattle Mutilation."
"Kenta made his return to Ring of Honor on May 11 of the next year against Delirious in a winning effort. Ring of Honor made its pay per view debut with the show, Respect is Earned, teaming with Nigel McGuinness against Danielson and Takeshi Morishima in a losing effort, after which Kenta spent several months with the company competing against rival, Davey Richards and his contingency, the No Remorse Corps. Kenta made his next appearance on the ""Glory By Honor VI"" tour; the first night had him team with the GHC Heavyweight Champion Mitsuharu Misawa against Takeshi Morishima and Naomichi Marufuji, with the match ending in a thirty-minute time limit draw. The following night, Kenta wrestled Misawa for the GHC Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort."
"Kenta made his return in 2009 against ROH World Champion, Nigel McGuinness in a losing effort at the company's seventh anniversary show. He returned a few weeks later to challenge Davey Richards once more, as well as make his second pay per view appearance for Take No Prisoners teaming with Tyler Black against Katsuhiko Nakajima and Austin Aries. Kobayashi was scheduled to return to ROH in November 2009, but was forced to cancel the appearances after suffering a knee injury."
"On January 27, 2014, Kenta, with Noah's blessing, entered WWE's Performance Center in Orlando, Florida for a tryout. In a press release, Kenta claimed that he was not after a WWE contract, but only wanted to fulfill a dream and take part in a WWE workout. On June 27, Tokyo Sports reported that Kenta had signed with WWE. His signing was officially announced during an in-ring segment on July 12 in Osaka. Kobayashi relocated to Orlando to resume training at the Performance Center, while also working for WWE's developmental territory NXT."
"Kobayashi debuted on September 11 at , introduced by William Regal, where he announced his new ring name, ""Hideo Itami"", meaning ""Hero of Pain"", and fended off The Ascension when they interrupted the segment to confront Regal. Itami made his in-ring debut at the following day's tapings of ""NXT"", defeating Justin Gabriel, after which he was attacked by The Ascension. During the following weeks, Itami kept engaging The Ascension in brawls, but continually lost due to the numbers disadvantage; the storyline was that as a newcomer in NXT, Itami did not have any friends in the locker room to help him. This continued until November, when Finn Bálor debuted as Itami's new partner. After weeks of feuding with The Ascension, Itami and Bálor defeated them at on December 11. Itami then participated in an NXT Championship number one contender's tournament, defeating Tyler Breeze in the first round, starting a feud between the two. He suffered his first defeat in NXT on January 15, 2015, when he was defeated by Bálor in the semi-finals, thus eliminating him from the tournament. At , Itami defeated Breeze in a rematch. They continued to exchange victories over each other until Itami lost a two-out-of-three falls match to Breeze on the April 1 episode of ""NXT"" to end the feud. On March 27, Itami won the WrestleMania Axxess NXT tournament by defeating Adrian Neville and then Finn Bálor to get a spot in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal on the pre-show of WrestleMania 31, where he was eliminated by eventual winner Big Show."
"On May 20 at , Itami was scheduled to face Finn Bálor and Tyler Breeze in a triple threat match to determine the number one contender for the NXT Championship; however, Itami was ruled out due to injury after an attack he suffered before the event started. This was made as Itami had suffered a legitimate shoulder injury, which required surgery and was expected to sideline him for six months. In January 2016, it was reported that Itami had suffered complications with his shoulder and was ""nowhere close to being able to return""."
"After over a year of inactivity, Itami returned to the ring on June 30, 2016, at an NXT live event, teaming with TM-61 to defeat Samoa Joe, Blake and Tino Sabbatelli in a six-man tag team match. On August 3, Itami made his televised return, defeating Cruiserweight Classic competitor Sean Maluta. At , Itami confronted Austin Aries, following the latter's match with No Way Jose, exchanging blows before attacking Aries with a ""GTS"". On October 12 at an NXT live event, Itami suffered a neck injury after a botched powerslam from Riddick Moss and would not be able to team with Kota Ibushi in the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic in which he was scheduled to compete in. In a video announcement published on October 18, Itami vowed to return to in-ring competition at NXT's first show in Japan on December 3. However, at the event, Itami did not compete but was instead in an in-ring segment alongside William Regal where they talked to the crowd."
"Itami made his televised return on April 19, 2017, where he confronted NXT Champion Bobby Roode, before slapping him and executing a ""GTS"". This led to a match at , in which Itami was unsuccessful in winning the title from Roode. On the June 7 episode of NXT, furious after his loss to Roode, Itami faced Oney Lorcan, which ended in a no-contest after Itami performed three ""GTS""s on Lorcan until Kassius Ohno attempted to save Lorcan, teasing a heel turn and a feud between the pair. On the July 5 episode of NXT, Itami teamed with Ohno in a tag team match against Sanity (Killian Dain and Alexander Wolfe), but lost after Itami refused to tag in Ohno. On the July 26 episode of NXT, Itami faced Ohno in the main event, which ended after Itami intentionally disqualified himself with a low blow to Ohno before viciously attacking and laying him out after two ""GTS""s, followed by a third onto the steel steps, cementing his heel turn. On the August 2 edition of ""NXT"", Itami cut an in-ring promo, demanding respect from the fans. He was interrupted by Aleister Black, who was scheduled to face Kyle O'Reilly in the night's main event. After a stare down between the two, Black hit Itami with ""Black Mass"". Itami attempted to assault Black following the event, but the two were separated by fellow talent. At , Itami was defeated by Black. In his last NXT match, Itami defeated Fabian Aichner at a live event on December 16."
"On November 21, 2017, it was announced that Itami would be moving to the main roster as part of the cruiserweight division on ""205 Live"". On the December 18 episode of ""Raw"", Itami would make his main roster debut, aiding Finn Bálor to fend off and face Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas in a tag team match, which Itami and Bálor would win. On the December 25 episode of ""Raw"", Itami would defeat The Brian Kendrick, in which Kendrick would suffer an injury following a Go to Sleep by Itami. This would lead to Itami entering a short feud with Kendrick's tag team partner, Gentleman Jack Gallagher, where Gallagher would challenge Itami to a match on the December 26 episode of ""205 Live"", which Itami would win. On the January 2, 2018, episode of ""205 Live"", Itami would be challenged to a rematch by Gallagher, however, Gallagher attacked Itami with an umbrella and a pipe before the match. On the January 23 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami would defeat Gallagher, ending their feud."
"On the February 6 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami would be defeated by Roderick Strong in the first round of the WWE Cruiserweight Championship tournament. After that, Itami began teaming up with fellow Japanese wrestler Akira Tozawa and they started a feud with Gran Metalik and Lince Dorado, which ended when they lost a tornado tag team match on the April 17 episode of ""205 Live"" after Tozawa accidentally kicked Itami. After a tag team loss to The Brian Kendrick and Gentleman Jack Gallagher, Itami shoved Tozawa, signaling their break up. The following week on ""205 Live"", Itami defeated Tozawa to end the feud. On the June 5 episode of ""205 Live"", he attacked both Buddy Murphy and Mustafa Ali during their match, causing a disqualification and resulting in Itami being suspended from the following week's episode."
"Soon after, he began a feud with Ali, Murphy, and Cedric Alexander for the Cruiserweight Championship. On the June 19 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami defeated Ali and Murphy in a triple threat match, thus earning a championship match. On the July 10 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami unsuccessfully challenged Alexander for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the July 24 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami failed to win a number one contender's fatal four-way match also involving Ali, TJP, and the eventual winner Drew Gulak. On the August 7 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami defeated Ali in a singles match after which Ali collapsed. On the September 25 episode of ""205 Live"", Ali and Itami wrestled to a double count out. This led to a Falls Count Anywhere match on the October 24 episode of ""205 Live"", which Itami lost."
"Since November 2018, Itami formed an alliance with Ariya Daivari. On the January 8, 2019 episode of ""205 Live"", Itami defeated Cedric Alexander to qualify for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship fatal four-way match involving champion Buddy Murphy, Kalisto, and Tozawa at the Royal Rumble, where he lost after being pinned by Murphy."
"On January 29, it was reported that Itami requested and was granted his release from the company after a five year run. That same day, after a loss to Tozawa on ""205 Live"", Daivari turned on Itami. This was followed by multiple members of the roster saying goodbye to Itami on social media. On February 4, 2019, the WWE Performance Center YouTube channel that documents the Superstars travel and backstage life released a video chronicling Itami's last week in WWE. The video features Itami working with Daivari and talking about his struggles with learning to speak and understand English. The end of the video sees Hideo walking back to gorilla position and being given a standing ovation from those in the backstage area. On February 22, Kobayashi was officially released by WWE, as the company formally acknowledged his departure on Twitter."
"Kenta made his surprise debut for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) on June 9, 2019 at the Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall event, with Katsuyori Shibata as his manager, announcing his participation in the 2019 G1 Climax tournament. Kenta made his in-ring debut for NJPW on July 6, defeating Kota Ibushi as a part of the tournament. Kenta, competing in the A Block of the tournament, stayed undefeated in singles matches for over a month and a half, defeating Hiroshi Tanahashi, Lance Archer, and Evil before suffering his first defeat against IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada on July 27, as part of the tournament. Kenta would then lose his next four matches against Sanada, Bad Luck Fale, Will Ospreay and Zack Sabre Jr., failing to win the tournament with a final tally of 8 points."
"On the final night of the tournament, Kenta competed in a six-man tag team match alongside Chaos members Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi against Bullet Club's Bad Luck Fale, Tama Tonga, and Tanga Loa, only to turn on them in the closing moments of the match and assisting the Bullet Club for the victory. As Kenta was going to explain his actions, Katsuyori Shibata rushed into the ring and attacked Kenta until the rest of the Bullet Club members ambushed Shibata. At Royal Quest on August 31, Kenta defeated Ishii for the NEVER Openweight Championship, his first championship in NJPW. The match was criticized because Kobayashi suffered a concussion after a back suplex by Ishii, getting knocked out in the process. However, both continued the match without referee stoppage. He was sent to the hospital after the show. At Destruction in Kagoshima on September 16, Kenta unsuccessfully faced Kota Ibushi for the Tokyo Dome IWGP Heavyweight Championship challenge rights certificate."
"At Power Struggle, Kenta retained his title against Ishii in a rematch. Later in the night, he interfered in the main event between Jay White and Hirooki Goto helping White, a fellow Bullet Club member, retain the title while also once again assaulting Shibata. Kenta lost the NEVER Openweight Championship to Goto at Wrestle Kingdom 14 on January 5, 2020, ending his reign at 127 days with two successful defenses. Later that night, after the main event for both the IWGP Heavyweight Championship and IWGP Intercontinental Championship between Kazuchika Okada and Tetsuya Naito (which Naito won), KENTA attacked Naito and hit him with the GTS, and sat on top of him posing with both of Naito's newly won belts."
= = = Bioswale = = =
Bioswales are linear channels designed to concentrate and convey stormwater runoff while removing debris and pollution. Bioswales can also be beneficial in recharging groundwater.
"Bioswales are typically vegetated, mulched, or xeriscaped. They consist of a swaled drainage course with gently sloped sides (less than 6%). Bioswale design is intended to safely maximize the time water spends in the swale, which aids the collection and removal of pollutants, silt and debris. Depending on the site topography, the bioswale channel may be straight or meander. Check dams are also commonly added along the bioswale to increase stormwater infiltration. A bioswale's make-up can be influenced by many different variables, including climate, rainfall patterns, site size, budget, and vegetation suitability."
"A thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electric power. In most places the turbine is steam-driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated. This is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different heat sources; fossil fuel power generation, though nuclear heat energy, solar heat energy, biofuels, and waste incineration are also used. Some prefer to use the term ""energy center"" because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy. Certain thermal power stations are also designed to produce heat for industrial purposes, for district heating, or desalination of water, in addition to generating electrical power."
"Almost all coal, petroleum, nuclear, geothermal, solar thermal electric, and waste incineration plants, as well as many natural gas power stations are thermal. Natural gas is frequently burned in gas turbines as well as boilers. The waste heat from a gas turbine, in the form of hot exhaust gas, can be used to raise steam by passing this gas through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG). The steam is then used to drive a steam turbine in a combined cycle plant that improves overall efficiency. Power stations burning coal, fuel oil, or natural gas are often called ""fossil fuel power stations"". Some biomass-fueled thermal power stations have appeared also. Non-nuclear thermal power stations, particularly fossil-fueled plants, which do not use cogeneration are sometimes referred to as ""conventional power stations""."
"Commercial electric utility power stations are usually constructed on a large scale and designed for continuous operation. Virtually all electric power stations use three-phase electrical generators to produce alternating current (AC) electric power at a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. Large companies or institutions may have their own power stations to supply heating or electricity to their facilities, especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes. Steam-driven power stations have been used to drive most ships in most of the 20th century until recently. Steam power stations are now only used in large nuclear naval ships. Shipboard power stations usually directly couple the turbine to the ship's propellers through gearboxes. Power stations in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity. Nuclear marine propulsion is, with few exceptions, used only in naval vessels. There have been many turbo-electric ships in which a steam-driven turbine drives an electric generator which powers an electric motor for propulsion."
"Cogeneration plants, often called combined heat and power (CHP) facilities, produce both electric power and heat for process heat or space heating, such as steam and hot water."
"The reciprocating steam engine has been used to produce mechanical power since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by James Watt. When the first commercially developed central electrical power stations were established in 1882 at Pearl Street Station in New York and Holborn Viaduct power station in London, reciprocating steam engines were used. The development of the steam turbine in 1884 provided larger and more efficient machine designs for central generating stations. By 1892 the turbine was considered a better alternative to reciprocating engines; turbines offered higher speeds, more compact machinery, and stable speed regulation allowing for parallel synchronous operation of generators on a common bus. After about 1905, turbines entirely replaced reciprocating engines in large central power stations."
The largest reciprocating engine-generator sets ever built were completed in 1901 for the Manhattan Elevated Railway. Each of seventeen units weighed about 500 tons and was rated 6000 kilowatts; a contemporary turbine set of similar rating would have weighed about 20% as much.
"The energy efficiency of a conventional thermal power station is defined as saleable energy produced as a percent of the heating value of the fuel consumed. A simple cycle gas turbine achieves energy conversion efficiencies from 20 to 35%. Typical coal-based power plants operating at steam pressures of 170 bar and 570 °C run at efficiency of 35 to 38 %, with state-of-the-art fossil fuel plants at 46% efficiency. Combined-cycle systems can reach higher values. As with all heat engines, their efficiency is limited, and governed by the laws of thermodynamics."
"The Carnot efficiency dictates that higher efficiencies can be attained by increasing the temperature of the steam. Sub-critical fossil fuel power stations can achieve 36–40% efficiency. Supercritical designs have efficiencies in the low to mid 40% range, with new ""ultra critical"" designs using pressures of 4400 psi (30.3 MPa) and multiple stage reheat reaching 45-48% efficiency. Above the critical point for water of and 3212 psi (22.06 MPa), there is no phase transition from water to steam, but only a gradual decrease in density."
"Currently most nuclear power stations must operate below the temperatures and pressures that coal-fired plants do, in order to provide more conservative safety margins within the systems that remove heat from the nuclear fuel rods. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency to 30–32%. Some advanced reactor designs being studied, such as the very-high-temperature reactor, Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor, and supercritical water reactor, would operate at temperatures and pressures similar to current coal plants, producing comparable thermodynamic efficiency."
"The energy of a thermal power station not utilized in power production must leave the plant in the form of heat to the environment. This waste heat can go through a condenser and be disposed of with cooling water or in cooling towers. If the waste heat is instead used for district heating, it is called cogeneration. An important class of thermal power station is that associated with desalination facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of natural gas, and in these plants freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products."
"Other types of power stations are subject to different efficiency limitations. Most hydropower stations in the United States are about 90 percent efficient in converting the energy of falling water into electricity while the efficiency of a wind turbine is limited by Betz's law, to about 59.3%."
"The direct cost of electric energy produced by a thermal power station is the result of cost of fuel, capital cost for the plant, operator labour, maintenance, and such factors as ash handling and disposal. Indirect social or environmental costs, such as the economic value of environmental impacts, or environmental and health effects of the complete fuel cycle and plant decommissioning, are not usually assigned to generation costs for thermal stations in utility practice, but may form part of an environmental impact assessment."
"For units over about 200 MW capacity, redundancy of key components is provided by installing duplicates of the forced and induced draft fans, air preheaters, and fly ash collectors. On some units of about 60 MW, two boilers per unit may instead be provided. The list of coal power stations has the 200 largest power stations ranging in size from 2,000MW to 5,500MW."
"In the nuclear plant field, ""steam generator"" refers to a specific type of large heat exchanger used in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) to thermally connect the primary (reactor plant) and secondary (steam plant) systems, which generates steam. In a nuclear reactor called a boiling water reactor (BWR), water is boiled to generate steam directly in the reactor itself and there are no units called steam generators."
"In some industrial settings, there can also be steam-producing heat exchangers called ""heat recovery steam generators"" (HRSG) which utilize heat from some industrial process, most commonly utilizing hot exhaust from a gas turbine. The steam generating boiler has to produce steam at the high purity, pressure and temperature required for the steam turbine that drives the electrical generator."
Geothermal plants do not need boilers because they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids.
"A fossil fuel steam generator includes an economizer, a steam drum, and the furnace with its steam generating tubes and superheater coils. Necessary safety valves are located at suitable points to relieve excessive boiler pressure. The air and flue gas path equipment include: forced draft (FD) fan, air preheater (AP), boiler furnace, induced draft (ID) fan, fly ash collectors (electrostatic precipitator or baghouse), and the flue-gas stack."
"The boiler feedwater used in the steam boiler is a means of transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning steam turbine. The total feed water consists of recirculated ""condensate"" water and purified ""makeup water"". Because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to corrosion at high temperatures and pressures, the makeup water is highly purified before use. A system of water softeners and ion exchange demineralizers produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical insulator, with conductivity in the range of 0.3–1.0 microsiemens per centimeter. The makeup water in a 500 MWe plant amounts to perhaps 120 US gallons per minute (7.6 L/s) to replace water drawn off from the boiler drums for water purity management, and to also offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system."
"The feed water cycle begins with condensate water being pumped out of the condenser after traveling through the steam turbines. The condensate flow rate at full load in a 500 MW plant is about 6,000 US gallons per minute (400 L/s)."
"The water is pressurized in two stages, and flows through a series of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, in the middle of this series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus non-corrosive."
The boiler is a rectangular furnace about on a side and tall. Its walls are made of a web of high pressure steel tubes about in diameter.
"Fuel such as pulverized coal is air-blown into the furnace through burners located at the four corners, or along one wall, or two opposite walls, and it is ignited to rapidly burn, forming a large fireball at the center. The thermal radiation of the fireball heats the water that circulates through the boiler tubes near the boiler perimeter. The water circulation rate in the boiler is three to four times the throughput. As the water in the boiler circulates it absorbs heat and changes into steam. It is separated from the water inside a drum at the top of the furnace. The saturated steam is introduced into superheat pendant tubes that hang in the hottest part of the combustion gases as they exit the furnace. Here the steam is superheated to to prepare it for the turbine."
"Plants designed for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations as varied as Germany, Victoria, Australia, and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw hot gas from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and hot gas mixture into the boiler."
"Plants that use gas turbines to heat the water for conversion into steam use boilers known as heat recovery steam generators (HRSG). The exhaust heat from the gas turbines is used to make superheated steam that is then used in a conventional water-steam generation cycle, as described in the gas turbine combined-cycle plants section."
"The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the economizer. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers at the bottom of the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils."
"The boiler furnace auxiliary equipment includes coal feed nozzles and igniter guns, soot blowers, water lancing, and observation ports (in the furnace walls) for observation of the furnace interior. Furnace explosions due to any accumulation of combustible gases after a trip-out are avoided by flushing out such gases from the combustion zone before igniting the coal."
The steam drum (as well as the superheater coils and headers) have air vents and drains needed for initial start up.
"Fossil fuel power stations often have a superheater section in the steam generating furnace. The steam passes through drying equipment inside the steam drum on to the superheater, a set of tubes in the furnace. Here the steam picks up more energy from hot flue gases outside the tubing, and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature. The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves before the high-pressure turbine."
Nuclear-powered steam plants do not have such sections but produce steam at essentially saturated conditions. Experimental nuclear plants were equipped with fossil-fired superheaters in an attempt to improve overall plant operating cost.
"The condenser condenses the steam from the exhaust of the turbine into liquid to allow it to be pumped. If the condenser can be made cooler, the pressure of the exhaust steam is reduced and efficiency of the cycle increases."
"The surface condenser is a shell and tube heat exchanger in which cooling water is circulated through the tubes. The exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes as shown in the adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum."
